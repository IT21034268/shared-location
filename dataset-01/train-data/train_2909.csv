5,Great Little Timer,I bought this timer for myself about three years ago and it still works great. It is easy to set. The magnet is nice to stick the timer on the refrigerator if using in the kitchen. I use it for meditation and taking naps. It's great to take when traveling because it is so small and easy to pack. I bought this latest one for my daughter.
2,CDN timer,I was disappointed by this timer because the vibrate function is very noisy and the vibration isn't strong enough to feel unless you're actually holding it in your hand.
5,simple & good,"works great, i needed i silent timer to do yoga while the kids sleep, so the vibration & lights function work perfect for me."
3,"Great, except for one flaw","I bought this as a timer for workshop use (cabinetmaking). Having the options of vibrate/buzzer/flashing light are very useful.But the effete white-collar worker who designed this thing attached the belt clip not to the body of the timer, but to the sliding cover that holds in the batteries. So it's easy for a slight blow to just slide the timer off, leaving the clip on my belt and the timer on the floor."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,After reading the previous reviews I decided this was just the timer I was looking for. But it is probably the worst timer I own. The alarm is not loud enough to be heard more than three feet away and the vibration alarm is so weak I couldn't feel it in my pants pocket. The magnet works great so the timer isn't a total waste of money because I can put it on a metal surface and it adds color to surface. I would not recommend this product. I'm still in the market for a digital timer that actually has a loud alarm.
4,It's OK,Love the Larry Sanders Show. This 2nd season is Ok. The 3rd video listed some shows that were not on it....don't know why that was.
3,Ravenous Review,"OK, I waited a long time for a Bionicle book, and we get one. Frankly, it's not really my cup of tea. It's not that it's bad, just that it's mainly reused stuff from the website and comics. It's cool for two reasons though. For one, it fleshes out the 2001 storyline more, making it a more understandable period in the Bionicle saga. It's also great to give to a friend or parent who wants to know more about the Bionicle universe. As far as enjoyable reading goes, it doesn't get many stars. It uses simple language and has a few storyline errors. Overall though, it's a fun and useful way to fill people out on the world of Bionicle."
1,Unreadable,"Wansbrough is often mentioned as a pioneer in literary/textual criticism of the Koran. After reading a number of works on the origins and content of the Koran (by Ibn Warraq, Robert Spencer, and others), after reading the Koran itself several times, and after considerable time spent in literary/textual criticism of the Bible, I thought it was time to tackle Wansbrough. To my disappointment, however, I found his book quite unreadable. His English is obscure and laced with words that would stump a Scrabble champion. Then there are the hundreds of passages or terms in the original Arabic, Hebrew, Latin, Greek, and German. Perhaps there is merit buried in this tome, but it might as well have been written in cuneiform."
1,Doesn't work,I agree with the previous reviewer's comments. The Stylecam Snap didn't retain the shots I took despite a brand new battery. I returned the product for a refund.
5,Is exactly what I needed,The product met all my expectations and was delivered on time as promised. I ordered it through Amazon after not being able to find similar products in local Home Depot or Lowes stores. Those that the stores held did not fit the weight and design of my gate.
3,OK introduction to a brilliant band,"A sampler CD of the half-dozen or so full- (and sometimes double-) length albums released by Sweden's Flower Kings. There's nothing wrong with the selection, but the overall effect is a little anemic compared to the actual albums. Flower Kings are one of the very best 90s bands extant, and SCANNING is certainly no dog, but try instead to grab one of the proper releases: THE FLOWER KING, WORLD OF ADVENTURES, RETROPOLIS, STARDUST WE ARE, FLOWER POWER or the related solo albums by Roine Stolt and Tomas Bodin."
5,An Old Favorite,"This album has been one of my favorites since I was a small child. My family wore out our casette and had to wait for technology to catch up so we could upgrade to a CD.Sylvia Woods (who was the 1980 All Ireland Harp Champion) is a talented harp player as well as a composer. She has also written numerous books on harp intruction and harp music that are uniformally excellent.The suite tells a fairy tale story about the power of the harp. Sylvia's compositions range from spritely to heart-breaking.This abum inspired me to play the harp, using Sylvia's books (of course!). However, I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys celtic, world, or new age music."
4,Aussie Pad,Nice pad. Thin and lightweight.. My only complaint is the small pokey things in the pad I had to pick out. As if the wool wasn't cleaned and there were bits of grass or something in it. I didn't want it poking my horse while riding. I also wish the straps were a bit wider as its hard to get my girth in them. Overall a good everyday pad for the price.
4,Don't be fooled by the Label!,"Boxed Set? Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy this album but I bought it thinking I'd have a nice BoxSet to sit in the bookshelf, not on the CD rack. Imagine my suprised when I discovered it was just a normal double CD. Still, a very good album"
4,Not too bad,"Was a little slow and not like her other books, but I like Kathleen Morgan and I enjoyed reading this novel."
5,Great Book,I love Kathleen Morgan!! I really like how she incorporates a good story with a spiritual base. She never fails to deliver!
5,Ireland,Enjoyed this book very much...part love story....exciting...touching...I enjoyed this writer very much...recommend this book to all interested in stories about Ireland
4,Nice Bright Green Post-It Flags,"****These little flags from post-it are quite bright and nicer than the little (1/2 inch) skinny ones for marking places in books and on documents.They are very thin, though, so they are ideally not used as index tabs or anything that would require a sturdier flag. Their thinness is an advantage if you are flagging many places in a book or document set as many can be placed without the book or pile of papers becoming bulky. Post-It makes another flag, which it calls their ""Durable"" flag and is heavier if you are looking for something to use as a tab.With most pens and and even with a pencil, they can be written on, which is nice. And of course, they are transparent. I have found the Post-it brand to be consistent in its quality, as opposed to other manufacturers who sometimes don't make the flag sticky enough. They come in a wide variety of colors! This review is for the single pack of one dispenser of green flags.Recommended.****"
4,Almost Perfect,"Well it works as it should. But the fuse was faulty - not blown, but faulty - so after replacing it the extension worked fine with my traffic camera and GPS plugged in.However, because it's plugged in permanently I would have preferred it to be a little shorter and for the cord to be 6"" longer.But it serves my purpose and that's what really matters to me."
2,POS,"loose and jiggly, wouldn't maintain a connection to the power port and the triple socket things came loose. RETURNED FOR REFUND.But it is a Bell and they usually have quality stuff so it might have just been the luck of the draw."
1,Does not work well,"I'm not happy with the Bell Triple Socket. It does not make solid contact when put the car's electrical socket. Tends to pop out again all on its own. Was going to try it in a different car, but then the plastic face surrounding the 3 sockets peeled off. Decided to buy a replacement socket extender (different manufacturer) and the new one works fine."
1,Was Great While it Lasted,"This product worked very well, while it worked. Used it for a multiple state road trip and it worked all there and back and then some but then suddenly quit working after less than a month after purchasing it. It didn't melt like I see others have had the problem of melting, it just plain does not work. No power passes through it, I don't know if the problem lies in the plug or the three extension holes. Of course, I cannot return it or exchange it as I was apparently only given 30 days to do this in. Guess I should have heeded negative reviews more than I usually do, not that I ever completely ignore them, but usually I realize the product should fall somewhere between the good and bad reviews. Not in this case!"
4,Good,I like this and it serves it's purpose nicely. I just wish the cord was a little longer. I chose to put it in the rear of my suv and keept the front outlet open. DVD devices are plugged into this and strung from the middle seat to the 3rd row seating.
1,Under-fused,I purchased this device to run a laptop and GPS at the same time. It worked fine for the first 10 hour road trip but the plug melted making it unsuitable for any more trips. I figured with a 10 A fuse that it could run a laptop and GPS but apparently not. I'm in the process of purchasing a replacement for our next trip.
2,Poorly made. Sized smaller than advertised.,For $40 I expect a much better made costume. This is clearly designed as a one-time use for Halloween item (when we all know little boys love nothing more than playing dress-up all year long) and is poorly made. I expect we'll go through several of these before my son grows out of his Buzz Lightyear phase.I also strongly recommend ordering a larger size than need be. My 3 year old is too small for this 3-4 costume (it fits more like a 2T-3T than a 3T-4T and definitely doesn't fit like a 3-4).
1,"cute costume, but pricey 4 quality","My 3 1/2 yr old son Loved the costume, so i know thats all that matters, But the quality of it 4 the price is very cheesy, & cheep, compared to a costume i bought my 2 yr old at old navy 4 half the price, that is awsome quality, & definetly should of been more, then was, material & quality,,way better than the buzz one,,,but over all, kids like,,,"
3,Not durable at all,"Great costume for 1 time use. The jetpack straps broke right away and the costume ran rather small. Otherwise, my 2 year old son loved it!"
3,Disney Costume Child,"The Suit is too smal for the 3 year old, The Purchase was made for a size big enough to fit a 4 year old, the suit is good quality make just too small if I were to order again I would order a much bigger age group to ensure a fit. The Child loves it but is squeezed into it."
3,Not a match to the custom in picture,"The product as expected is of cheap quality; however, it did not match the image since the custom in the image is of better quality than the one I received.The padding on the forearms and lower legs non existing, nor the black waist or joints for shoulders. It really seems like I receive a step down version from the one in the picture.My son, being 3, did not realized the differences and was very happy with it, that is why I gave this product and overall 3 star rating."
1,Very low quality,"I bought this costume for my 3 year old boy for his birthday. First of all, re. The price it has very low quality and secondly, it is really hard to wear because it is one piece. I would not recommend this costume to anyone. It a one time only costume."
5,Buzz Lightyear costume,"Great costume. Looks so cute on, people told us how great he looked all night. Does run small. My son is 2 and we bought the 3T-4T and it fit him perfect. You really should buy the wings because it completes the look. Very happy with it. My son loves it and want's to wear it all the time. And he can because it holds up to it."
4,Halloween Costume,"This was a great Halloween Buzz costume. We didn't see anyone else who had this type of Halloween costume in our area. The only negatives were that the leg pieces were not sewn onto the costume, they were extra pieces you pulled onto your child's legs and they kept slipping down all evening. That was very annoying for us and our three year old son. Also, the size we bought was a 3/4T. Our son had just turned three in October and the costume was pretty much too short in the legs for him. We made some adjustments with the leg pieces and it looked fine."
4,Nice value,Good quality for the money spent. My son really likes it ...and he is a huge toy story fan. He will wear this until he out grows it.
2,Not particularly helpful.,"It's an OK book and if I'd read the title a little closer I probably wouldn't have purchased it. Basically the book details how IBD became a viable business by teaching different (and better) investing rules and helping average people locate potentially above average stocks. However, if you are interested in the hows and whys of stock picking get a subscription to IBD (I like the online PDF version myself) the information that comes with being a subscriber is far more detailed than what is in this book."
3,IBD a brief history,"After reading this book myself I have to agree with the other reviewers. This book is very short on any advice on becoming a millionaire, it is simply a brief history on how William O'Neal got the idea for the IBD newspaper and started it. It was more of a labor of love for him than anything and it took almost 20 years to make the paper profitable. I am a huge fan of all things IBD and have made $1,000's of dollars following the CAN-SLIM method, so of course I had to buy this book. If your an IBD fanatic like I am buy the book, if not pass and pick up ""How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market by Nicholas Darvas, it will probably be more of what you are looking for.(Also it is William O'Neal approved)."
5,Start of a great series,This book is the start of a great series. This book is good for kids as young as 10. Even with this being the case I really enjoyed this book.
3,"Enjoyable, but in need of better word selection.","An enjoyable book for anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre. There was one thing that caught me off guard though, in the beginning pages of the book there is an inappropriate word that doesn't belong in a children's book, but the rest of the book seems to be alright. If it's too much I would recommend getting a physical copy and crossing that word out."
3,Overrated,"I have no earthly idea why all three books in this series are rated as five stars. After being deceived by that I bought and read this book. It was OK, a bit amateurish, and rather derivative, with very few moments of originality. Granted, I am an adult, but there is much better juvenile sci-fi/ fantasy out there, like Cofler's Artemis Fowl series or Pratchett's Tiffany Aching series."
5,Excellent performance and easy installation,Compatible with many Dell AND HP monitors. I have installed the sound bar on a HP ZR2440W and it fits perfectly. The external power source allows me to switch off the monitor without interrupting the music :-)
1,DELL AS501 Sound Bar Speaker for Ultrasharp LCD NEW,"this item was listed as very good. There is no power cord, it won't work without a special connecting cord. Do not buy."
5,Excellent Product,I got this because it was good price and its works as intended. It has worked flawlessly for years on end.
5,speaker,"Great product. Works as designed. Much nicer than separate speakers, and it doesn't take up the space on one's desktop."
4,OK. Value for money. Nothing spectacular,"This is worth it for the convenience and the space-saving way it clips underneath the Dell Ultrasharp screen. The sound is clear but lacking in punch in the mid-range and with poor bass response, but that is inevitable for a speaker of this size and weight. Four stars because it is good. Not 5 stars because it is not excellent."
4,Good Speakers,"Simple to install, looks very nice, works O'K. Not very convenient way to adjust the volume but overall it is satisfactory."
3,Sound Bar Speaker,"I didn't get it for the specific monitor it was made to mount on, but for my use it is working well, saves having to have two speakers sitting around."
3,it is a good item,I purchased this but it was wrong for me I did not try it. I was looking for some thing different shipping was good product looked good
3,"good tea, poorly packed","Numi Mao Feng is good tea for the price, but the tea arrives in a brown bag that is not sealed. Tea dries up and becomes stale if it is not stored properly, in a sealed, light-proof container. It would not be difficult to wrap this tea in an air-tight way."
5,LOVE THIS TEA,"This tea and its sister Numi green teas is spectacular. It has a nuanced, sweet flavor that is so different from the junk they put in tea bags."
3,Instructions A Bit Lacking -Poor R&D- But Works Great,"I would be interested to know how people that use this product get the wires through the SEALED Body panel of the rear Quarter panel!My 2003 Grand Caravan has all the wiring running between the inner sub frame and the Body skin. There is No place to route the wire to the outside of the body. If you cut the grommet, as stated in the instructions, and feed the wire down the hole, it just piles up in a SEALED void. Short of drilling a 1 1/4"" hole in the underside corner of the body panel, there is no way to feed the wire back through the grommet and out of the vehicle.I chose to use a Half grommet to cover the bend I had to make between the lens housing and the body, then routed it Behind the hatch bumper and down behind the rear bumper cover, then over to the hitch. You end up with only 2"" dangle, but it works.Other than that, this was a very simple under 15 min job that almost anyone can do."
5,hopkins 42215 wirig kit,there is no mechanical knowlage required it has clear and concise instructions it took less tha fifteen minutes from start to finish to install.
3,The title is misleading!,"Although the book title implies that if we use the book we will be able to identify different grasses, there isn't a shred of information it this book that will allow us to identify any grass species. The book seems to have been created for a class on grass biology. It has a lot of good pictures on the different parts of the grass plant. But for instance if we want to know what Big Bluestem grass looks like, or if we are looking at a plant and want to figure out what species it is, this book does not provide any of that information at all. If you are looking for a companion book to a class on grass biology, this book is great. If you want to try to identify grass species, this book is worthless without a lot of additional information."
2,Best glossary,"Not especially useful for beginner grass identification because concentrates on structural detail rather than overall appearance of growth. However, I recommend it for its excellent illustrated glossary."
5,An Outstanding Reference and Very Useful,"Overall this is an outstanding reference for anyone wanting to learn the elements of grass identification. It is not intended as a book for identifying any particular grass. I used it for 20 years in a class I taught in Agrostology (Grass Taxonomy), and especially for beginners it was very useful for learning grass structures needed for identification, and to a lesser degree for structures of plants like sedges. Grasses are beautiful, but incredibly complex, and it takes many books and years to be really comfortable with them. Books such as Harrington's smooth the way, and make the task of learning grasses fun. Highly recommended :-)"
2,Poor book,"With this book, you will know all about how to identify a grass, and not be able to identify a single one. It reminds me of the new husband who sits on the edge of the bed and tells his new wife how wonderful it is going to be, but never gets around to it.I returned the book."
3,Dated patterns,"This is a well done book with beautiful pictures and easy to understand directions. That said, however, the patterns are very dated. The book is a Japanese publication from 1980 and it shows. But, if you are in the market for tablecloth patterns, this might be the book for you."
3,good for car camping,"Its a good overall bag. It is a little tight around the shoulders, bigger guys beware. The texture of the fill fabric has a real slick/slippery feel to it. It is warm. The wieght is good for a synthetic fill but dont think that its lightwieght. Recap: Good for car camping."
2,Very hard to assemble,Instructions are hard to follow and the quality of the product isn't that great either. But what do you really expect for $50.....
3,Citadel Space Saver Two-Door Bath Storage Cabinet,"After reading previous reviews about this product, I decided to purchase it anyway. It's a good thing my husband is a handyman. If it had been up to me to put it together, that would have been an impossibility. It came with absolutely no instructions. There was a paper that said it was instructions, but it was just a parts list and a picture of the cabinet. It is made of pressed wood (sawdust board), so it not especially sturdy. It is rather pretty when assembled. I wasn't sure about the purpose of the glue."
2,Not enough,This book written by revisionist historian Woodworth is a somewhat detailed outline of the battle with a few scattered biographical sketches of the leading generals. This short monograph is more like a detailed pamphlet than a book. The information in this book can be found elsewhere and it adds little or nothing to the history of the battle. A Deep Steady Thunder might be useful as a brief overview of the battle but a quick internet search shows many other resources available for free. Unless purchasing this monograph used for a few dollars it's not worth it.
2,rush job,"Woodworth would have benefited from a visit to the Chickamauga visitor's center and a look at resident historian Jim Ogden's maps. He does not give Thomas proper credit for preventing disaster both before and during the battle, and, at the very end of the book, couldn't resist putting in a plug for the ""quiet man, with an unassuming self-confidence...Ulysses S. Grant."""
5,Coconut oil,"pure organic, label easy to read, the manufacturer had nothing to hide in small print. Good price on product with that quality."
3,satisfactory,Good quantity for the price and feels good on skin Smell is acceptable ONly problem is its almost solid in jar and have to dig it out but after warming it in hands it goes on pretty well. At least it doesnt feel like 1/2 water like most moiturizers. Id buy it again.
2,Expensive,"Although this is a decent product, it is not the best, top of the line and it is found cheaper in th grocery store even at full price."
2,CHEAP!,"This stuff is cheaply made and doesn't even hold up to any real coconut oil lovers standards! If you want a product that packs the healthy punch for your money, THIS ISN'T IT! I use coconut oil for body, hair, and supplement. My skin is dry not even five minutes after applying this brand. Trust me there's better coconut oils out there for your buck. STAY AWAY!"
1,"Organic, but too processed for human consumption","This review is specific to the organic, refined version of the Spectrum Naturals Coconut Oil. Must be something in the ""refining"" process that messes up this product. It disagreed with me entirely and I would not recommend it for consumption. Stict to Nutiva oils, especially if you actually want something that smells/tastes like coconut."
1,What a let down.,I have been using spectrum organic naturals coconut oil for many years. When I received my order it was very fast but the oil didn't have smell like coconut or taste like coconut i was very disappointed.
1,Unsented Coconut Oil,"I bought this to make lip balm with, but ended up returning it. It didn't smell like coconut at all! It had sort of a faint weird smell actually. I guess it's super processed. I ended up with Artisana coconut oil after talking with the clerk at my local health food store."
4,Great for your hair...don't like the smell.,"I leave it in my hair over night. After washing my hair you don't smell it, but I can smell it on my pillowcase. So now I sleep with a towel on my pillow. It does not smell like coconut."
3,prefer the unrefined version,I buy this at my local Kroger store in the organic section. The refined is not a 'soft' as the unrefined product that Spectrum sales. This version does not have a coconut taste or smell and does not rub into your skin as well as the unrefined version does. I think I will use this small jar as hair conditioner and weekly 'grease' for my african american scalp as well as cooking. The refined versions around will not have the coconut flavor so it's better for all purpose cooking.
5,LOVE COCONUT OIL!!,"I have 2 children with milk/soy allergies, so no butter, milk, soy or shortening in their baked goods, (cakes, breads, biscuits, cookies, ect.) Coconut oil is GREAT substitute and we even prefer it! LOVE COCONUT OIL!"
3,The history of the development of Freeport and Paradise Island,"The second half of the book is much better documented than the first half. Much of the information on Paradise Island is slightly erroneous and there is little talk of the development of the Paradise Island Bridge that made the island accessible.The background on Wallace Groves and Freeport is sketchy and laden with accusations of his criminality. He owned several finance companies in the late 1920's which he sold to Abe Pritzker and then was involved in taking over Celotex, Certainteed Products, Hahn Department Stores (name changed to Allied Stores), United Cigar-Whelan Drugs, Loft's Candies and then Pepsi. His criminality only came when he was prosecuted under the Investment Company Act of 1940. After serving time, he returned to an office at Pepsi and then moved to the Bahamas where he bought most of Grand Bahama Island.However, the author does analyze Robert Vesco and the later times very well."
5,Great war movie reviews,"War Movies is a great read. I bought this book out of curiosity as a war movie fan and history enthusiast. I found each review (and there are hundreds of them) to be concise, insightful and knowledgeable about the conflict. This is certainly the most comprehensive effort to review war movies I have encountered. There are also outstanding summaries of movies by conflict, WWII, Korean, Vietnam, etc., in the back. I discovered many new movies. I can highly recommend this book."
3,A Decent Read; Surprisingly Neat to read,"I wasn't very interested in starting this book at first, hence the typical horrid fantasy cover. I found a well weaved story with a cast of at least eight or so characters to keep track of. One chapter would have endless paragraphs that switch from one point of view to another, quite interesting, but rather confusing and it got kind of dull after a while.Nevertheless, a must if you've read ""The Baker's Boy""."
4,"A man betrayed, review.",Part two of the excellent 'Book of Words Trilogy'. Immensely enjoyed book one and book two lives up to its predecessors standards. The storyline takes up where book one left off and contains all the intrigue and drama of the first installment. The characters are developed further as are the realtionships between the protagoinists and the antagonists. The plot is gripping and the arena for the story is vast and yet superbly described by Jones. I fully recommend these books. Enjoy.
1,It took a curel twist that could have been done another way,I didn't like what J.V. Jones did with her characters in this book. I liked The Bakers Boy up to a point but after reading this book... I just didn't like it at all. I read a lot of Fantasy and Science Fiction and though I love the detail of Jones description and the way the characters in the book come to life; I don't like unnessary curelty in a book. I just think there were little twists of curelty that could have had the same effect but done differently. If your numbed to the curelty of the world I say go for it. J. V. Jones talent is worth it but if not... well... its your choice.
5,Profitable Resource Guide,"If you want to grow lots of dope, this is the book! The hydroponics chapter is right on. I have been reading Jorge's articles in High Times and using his book. I sent my two kids through college with the proceeds. Thanks."
4,a good start,i started smoking a year ago at 32 now ive read this book and in no time i have several seedling growing. this is the first time anything i planted has lived. if i can do it you can to.
2,Edit me!,"The ""newly revised"" edition that I received has so many typos, misspellings, incorrectly placed punctuation marks, etc., that I had trouble taking any of it seriously. Honestly, it doesn't appear that anyone edited a page of this book before it was published."
4,great inspiration along with fantastic advice for those who want to change the world,"Wood brings a fresh, business-like perspective to the often stale world of not-for-profits. His personal journey from career success, to existential angst, to leaving the rat race to change the world is a true inspiration."
5,Great story quick access to it!!,Just got on an ebook format and the process was quick and painless.Great story!!I just which it could be in audio too...
5,great inspirational book,great book if you are contemplating quitting the rat race and do something you enjoy doing.
5,Wonderful,"This book is great. It's enlightening to see the impact that an idea for positive change can have on the world. The current Room to Read site speaks for itself. Over 7.4 million books have been donated, 10,000 libraries have been created, and over 1,100 schools have been built.Wood balances narrative and introspection well."
5,Leaving Microsoft to change the World,Seeing how a man with a passion to help educate the underprillage country's was wonderful. How he got friends family to support his cause Irecoment this for anyone that wants to help...
5,Great Book!,"Very well written book. Enjoyed reading it, and finished it in two days. John Wood has done a tremendous service to Nepal and Cambodia (two countries in which I used to live and work). Amazing work that needed to be done. Great reading also in the book about some of the inner workings of Microsoft as well. Read this book!"
4,Inspiring book,"I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in making a difference in the world or wants to get off the corporate treadmill. This is the story of one man who did both. He is obviously passionate about Room to Read, and the reader can't help but feel his passion. The only downside is that it reads too much like a lightly-edited journal at times--it gets a bit repetitive toward the end (I heard a lot about his ""insane schedule"")."
1,dated and disappointing,"This book really needed an editor. There was so much unimportant information in here, like what type of coffee Mr. Wood had with his breakfast, the amount of flights he took, where he sat in the airplane, or the mention of donors names, for no other fact then they donated money. What happened to modesty?It read like a long acceptance speech with EVERYONE listed who works, donates or volunteers for Room to Read. I could see Mr. Wood thinking, if these names are in the book more money will be spent by these people to buy this book, and more schools will be built.If this frivolous text was removed and replaced with facts and advice for others that may have similar businesses, the book would read better, and be about 1/8 of the size. At the end he mentions that Room to Read publishes more than 200 local language titles, was this anywhere else in the book? I was really disappointed that the nitty gritty details of how a business like this was run were totally looked over."
4,Inspirational and informative,"This was recommended to me by a former manager (who quickly recanted the recommendation upon hearing I wasn't terribly happy at work, ""oh, don't read this then. you'll quit for sure"").Very inspirational story. And while a quick read, there were some isolated nuggets about lessons learned on ramping up organizations and thinking big."
5,changing the world- forever,the book was well written and very hard to put down. the book flows well and is very informative about mid life career conflicts. this journey by mr woods shows how one person can truly make a difference in the world.a must read by all who are concerned about the state of our world.
5,Making a difference one book at a time..,"I got more than I bargained for with this story of a man who seeks to make a difference to the world's children building libraries and funding books. It was wonderful to read of a person who cut through the redtape and just delivered the goods (even by yak!) rather than getting bogged down in the question of 'how will we do this?' and all the reasons why it can't be done. I would highly recommend this book if you need a shot of faith in the world and belief that lasting changes can be made by ordinary people. If you believe in the value of education, especially for girls who are often overlooked in the race for literacy in third world countries, then you need to read this book and make a conscious decision to support international aid programs where a simple thing like learning to read will improve a child's life immeasurably."
4,A very convenient compilation,"Ska Killers is actually a compilation of two early Toasters releases: Skaboom and Thrill Me Up. So do yourself a favor and catch this one instead of paying twice for them. The Toasters' sound from that early era (1987/88) is a little different from today's, but still good enough to enjoy. A pioneering band."
1,Recorder worked - for a while - now broken,"the play function works, sometimes, but the recorder function has failed completely - disappointing as the product was pretty good while it worked."
2,Titles don't show up on other DVD players,"I like all the functions of this DVD player. Mainly I got it for the firewire input, to quickly transfer dv tape to DVD. But, though you can title a disc, and finalize that disc, the end result will only display the title of the disc on the Samsung unit! What's the point of that? Tech support initially denied that this was possible and then relented that they'd experienced this a few times and would get back to me.I don't know about you, but I sometimes watch DVDs on my laptop or elsewhere, or make them for other people who don't have the same DVD player I have, so to me not being able to see a title other than ""Samsung DVD Recorder Session"" is not helpful.Overall, good recorder, good function set. Bad titling."
4,Good price - good features,"With DVD blank discs now at less than $.25, this is a great way to capture and archive your favorite shows. Not having the internal hard drive limits use for frequent record and erase, since erase means discard the DVD, but at recent prices for the blanks, perhaps that is not a problem! Easy to use ergonomics. Lots of variety in connecting both in and out."
1,lasted 5 months,"It played well up till 5 months and the menus went to spanish. The menus are also mispositioned, some don' even appear anymore, and you can't change any of the settings. Remote has to be right in front of player or it won't work."
1,"Wasted Money, Time and DVDs","This unit was great, for a few months. Then it decided it wasn't going to accept any DVDs, pre-recorded, blank, or it's own recordings.My story is pretty much the same as the majority of the reviews I've read on this unit, here or on other review sites.Wish I had read them first. Don't buy this unit, don't even use it for free. If you do, make sure you finalize every recording you make immediately.Otherwise you've just wasted your time and DVD."
1,Worst electronic product ever purchased,This is the single worst electronic product that I have ever purchased. The unit quickly stopped reading most DVDs and was useless fairly early after purchase. I had good luck with Samsung in the past but will NEVER buy anything from them again.
1,"Run, run!!!! Save you money!!!! Do Not Buy!!!!","This is an absolute, verified, certified piece of ****. I bought it to record from my other samsung product, a digital recorder (also a piece) and it stinks! The record function has more limits that a limited offer and to record off the TV you have to summon the gods with incense and sacrifice. it will not play half the discs I own which play perfectly well on my $40 target special. Did I mention this was a poor purchasing decision?"
1,Terrible,"Am very disappointed with both the unit and Samsung service. The unit started rejecting all discs...no matter what format...after only two weeks. Samsung service insisted that I try a cleaning disc before they do anything. They couldn't understand that the unit was rejecting ALL discs.After another two calls it took a full week to get authorization to send it out for repair. The unit has been sitting at their designated repair facility for two weeks now ""waiting for parts"". No one can tell me what is specifically wrong and Samsung will not just replace the unit.I can only say this is a very bad Samsung experience."
1,System does not work...Rejecting all discs,Ordered this unit after looking at all the great feedback and just got the delivery tonight. However was disappointed to note its rejecting ALL DVDs/CDs to play or to record. Does not play an MP3 CD nor a DVD video disk working in other players nor records on a DVD+R/-R/RW :-(. Planning on returning back the unit.
2,Sent it right back,"I can't complain about the price or the fast service, Amazon was great, but the quality of the product was very poor. I was initially concerned when I saw how cheap the remote control was. The unit itself was junk and of very low quality and performance as anything at this price point would suggest. I thought prior to purchase that it was just my luck it was so inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. I have othe Samsung products I am very happy with, that were not so inexpensive, but you won't get something for almost nothing even from this manufacturer."
4,irreverent,"For years, I've been seeing Gahan Wilson's warped drawings in science fiction magazines and the New Yorker. He's branching out. His trademark twisted sketches generously decorate this book. Possibly an inspired choice of illustrator by the author. It syncs with the irreverent tone of many of his explanations of business terms.Put it this way. If you ken to the spirit of Dilbert, then you may well enjoy this book as a companion text. Dilbert concentrates on technical issues. Sturgeon broadens the scope to most any type of company. Chances are, you might already be familiar with most of the terms. But perhaps not with the spin given in the book."
2,Green Weenies and Due Diligence,"This book is to inspire us poor business people who want to be catapulted to the inner circle of the rich business people. It's full of terms for the business person who can't spend 30 years learning them. Dan Hanlon, Chairman, CEO of Union Hill Ventures, gives a testimony: ""A way to laugh and learn the nuances of the business world...""But then you find:""Dirt in the Oyster"" -- A gem that is just waiting to grow and be discovered.""Dog's Breakfast"" --An outcome that is far from the desired result.""Playing football without a helmet"" -- Someone who takes too much risk.""Leg your way into it"" --Going in slowly and working your way through the obstacles.Throughout the book nothing seems all that funny. Obviously the title is meant to grab your attention and that's all it grabs. With ""all hands on deck"" and ""back in the saddle"" the book might have saved itself with new twists on old clichés but it missed out on a chance to be clever"
4,"Hey, nice Jpop musics in this CD!","For those of you, who are Japanese, should try this CD. Her songs are somewhat different from other Japanese Artists', and she has an ability to speak English perfectly in her songs. Since most of Japanese has hard time speaking English, and also, her songs contain some Native English! It is starting to become popular in Japan, that to include some English in their songs, though most of the buyers don't even know what it means. But, I would recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in Jpop for either listen to music or study how to sing song in English. :)"
5,It really does what they say!,"I was very scared about putting my china in the microwave and dishwasher, but honestly, I've done both to my china many times. Because it's so easy to clean, you could use it every day. The pattern is very simple and elegant so it looks great at a special holiday dinner or a more casual meal. This is the only china I've been able to find anywhere that will go in the dishwasher and microwave safely and is still reasonably priced."
5,This was the best book I ever read!,"I loved this book, I couldn't put it down but I also suggestChicken Soup For The Teenage Soul it's just asgood!"
5,"A 5 STAR BOOK ABOUT KIDS, JUST FOR KIDS!","Chicken Soup For The Kids Soul - I give it 5 stars. The name says it all: it is for kids, and it heals kids soulld with stories of death, love, self esteem, curage, and abuse/drugs and alcohol. I am 13 years old, and i loved the book. The reason kids enjoy the book is because it is true stories from a kids point of view, it is written by superstars, sports stars, and other famous people including Saquell O'neil, Jack Nickleson, and Jennifer Love Huitt tell stories from their childhood days, and give a little message too. Another reason kids enjoys this book is because it is written by kids all over America like you and me. So if you get the chance to read the 5 star rated book put together and edited by 5 NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLING AUTHORS, and see if it touches your soul!"
1,NOT FOR KIDS!!!,DID ANYONE WHO LEFT 5 STARS ACTUALLY READ THIS BOOK? THIS WAS SO NOT FOR CHILDREN. PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THESE DISTURBING STORIES.READ THE OTHER PEOPLES REVIEWS WHO ONLY LEFT 1 STAR. MY 12 YEAR OLD THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE. HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF INCEST UNTIL HE READ THIS BOOK. IT WASN'T EVEN UPLIFTING BECAUSE MY SON SAID THE FATHER DID IT TO HER FOR YEARS BEFORE SHE TOLD ANYONE. I FEEL LIKE SUING THE PUBLISHER.
5,Very encouraging and helpful!,"I really thought that ""Chicken Soup for the Kid's Soul"" was a great book. I understand more from reading others that have gone threw the same thing I go threw everyday. It also encouraged me to follow through with things and get them over with, because it helps to get it off your mind as soon as possible. I'd like to thank the authors of this book and the authors that continue the series of the many many 'Chickin Soup' books. And for writing one for us kids. Thanks again!"
5,Chicken Soup for the Kids Soul,"Chicken Soup for the Kids Soul is a fantastic, well-written book. This book includes many stories about kids going through life. The stories are about love, sorrow, family, achieving dreams and many more. The stories will make kids think of times they went through. It's an inspiring book that will make kids believe in themselves. I would give this book five stars."
5,HOPE AND COURAGE FOREVER,"I like the way they organize the little stories as they are. The poems touch my heart. I was really moved when the sentences started becoming wonderful feelings that came to me. I especially like the funny, heart-trending ""book"" poem. I highly reccommend this book for kids who need laughter and parents who want their kids to be cheerful and understand about life."
4,A mixed bag.,Overall the stories are both entertaining and heart warming. Some of them are quite sappy but all of the stories are thankfully short which keeps the flow of the book going at a comfortable reading pace. It's the type of book to read in small chunks.
5,I NEVER WANTED TO PUT IT DOWN!,I liked this book alot.I have read other chicken soup books but this is just the right one if you are between the ages of 8-12.Adults can read this too.It's a great heartwarming book!
1,Suzanne Somers Body Toning???????,"If you expect to see Suzanne Somers doing any exercise, forget it. This extremely short tape in EP mode is a real rip-off in my opinion. It has a few unknowns using Thighmaster. What does this have to do with Suzanne Somers? Nothing that I can see, other than using her name to sell tapes. The minute or so she spends on the introduction at the beginning was not worth the postage. No wonder this tape was a bust. Pass the word."
1,Couldn't Figure This Out,"After downloading this to my Kindle, I could not figure out how to open the poems to read them or to listen to them. I finally found the Table of Contents, but when I clicked on an underlined title, it took me to that title in very bold print, but it would not open. It didn't cost anything, but I guess you get what you pay for. If you figure out how to read the poems, let me know."
3,Not the best selections,"Though I enjoy Herrick, these were not the selections I was hoping for. Nevertheless, the book is still a good read. Maybe the selections will appeal to you more."
1,didn't work for me either,I also was unalbe to view any poems. I was able to view the preface and a list of poems but no actual verse.
5,Scientific method to product definition and marketing!,"I haven't ever taken the time to write a review before. But I LOVE this book. If you have ever been disappointed with the outcome of discussions concerning how to define and position products because proposals were justified on gut instincts, group think or ""I have 30 years experience""- then this book is for you.Ulwick outlines a scientific process that takes the voodoo out of this process focussing on what customers actually want and how to separate that from what they say they want. Also included is how to position existing offerings using this scientific process.Read this book."
5,Practical and proven advice for product developers,"This book provides a great framework for improving the likelihood of successful development inititiatives. The case studies included effectively move the reader from the theoretical to the practical. So many innovation cultures promote brainstorming to pursue hundreds of end points rather than fostering processes to provide precision, focus, and predictability. Although the former can be initially fun and invigorating, the latter is sustaining and profitable-- that is always more fun!I recommend this book to those companies seeking an improvement in outcomes associated with their development initiatives. Great for marketers, business and product developers, as well as the C-suite folks. This read provided me with a great deal to work with and work on in the future."
2,Not worth buying,"This book emphasizes traditional Chinese character, but that is not the reason I don't like it. The book is basically a listing of about 5,000 Chinese characters and their definitions. As any student of Chinese know, most Chinese words are not one character, thus this book is really not a ""dictionary"" in the traditional sense that it define Chinese words. It merely defines Chinese characters, and therefore, it is really not a valuable tool for those who want a real dictionary.As a character dictionary, it is okay. Not bad, but certainly not good either. If you do want a character dictionary (but not a WORD dictionary), however, I would recommend that you get the Xinhua Dictionary with English Translation (7801031989), which contains about 10,000 characters that are defined in greater details than anything avaiblabe in this book."
5,Finally something that makes sense!,I am thrilled with this book - it is so easy to understand - I'm finally getting somewhere!
2,There are better titles out there,"This is a somewhat pasted together, self-published book and looks like it. The information is OK, but could be better organized, and it really isn't ""easy-access"" as the title claims."
2,has wrong character,book contains incorrect characters... so how can u trust that all of them are correct?
5,"A ""must read"" prior to seeking a good chinese dictionary.","In my stuggles with the Chinese I have encountered many dictionaries and text books. This is probably the best comprehensive introduction to Chinese that I've seen. If you're going to China, taking Chinese classes or if you just want to read a Chinese menu, this probably will not be the last or most comprehensive book that you will want but it is the very first book that you must get! Reading it will make all future encounters with Chinese significantly demystified and much more user-friendly. Best of all, you will learn to navigate through a Chinese to English dictionary with ease. Buy it, and enjoy!"
1,Bogus Listings on Amazon,Amazon had this item listed but the vendor never had it in stock & the order was finally cancelled. You're better off going directly to the vendors web site to see what they really stock. I will only buy items from Amazon that they directly ship. I've had bad luck with their vendors in the past.
4,Good,Great social work text. Been very useful in my master's class. Incorporating the strengths perspective is important in both macro and micro social work.
1,I wanted to burn this book!,"Book arrived quickly and as described. However, I was not happy with the price considering this was just a paperback, contains NO glossary and the index is not very useful. The book price went up $10 overnight."
1,don't waste your money,"Bought this product from Motherhood Maternity. It hurt when I tried to use it, didn't help AT ALL, and was a waste of money. I tried multiple times, but it never worked. This maternity support belt is just a thick piece of elastic with some velcro. But it's not thick enough to be comfortable. If you're thinking of buying this one, try buying a strip of elastic the same width, sew on a little velcro, wrap it around your waist, and see if it's comfortable.Bought the 3-piecematernity support belt by Especially for Mom, from BabiesRUs, and never wanted to take it off. Absolutely LOVED it. Made doing EVERYTHING easier and more comfortable."
3,Did not do much for me.,"Though this product does offer some belly support, it does not offer back support. I have a lot of lower back pain and expected this to help, but didn't really."
1,Maternity Support Belt,"This product actually caused me more pain in my groin area and legs. It was hard to find a comfortable adjustment and it wasn't wide enough to really support my belly. Since I had to take it off every single time I wanted to sit down, it just didn't seem worth it to put it on at all."
2,Stupid,"I thought this would help my back pain associated with being pregnant. However, it just slips and cuts into your extra pregnancy pounds. It's a waste of money."
2,Uncomfortable,The maternity belt is somewhat uncomfortable to me. I have not worn it that often due to that fact. It also slides up your back.
3,"Works, but could be improved.","It does provide support, but during the day it would slip and become too loose or dig into my body. Maybe I got it too late into my pregnancy. So I would either readjust it or take it off; usually I took it off because it became too uncomfortable. I wish the band was thicker, it probably would stay on better that way. It is a better deal for your money than other products, but it's probably better for postpartum and for earlier in your pregnancy."
4,Vegas stories - the good and the ugly,"I don't agree at all with the previous reviewer. This is, after all, a collection of short stories about the dreams, disappointments and odd-ball characters that make Las Vegas what it is. I found most of the stories delightful, with enexpected twists, and generally full of heart. If you're looking for Purlitzer Prize stories, look elsewhere. If you like to people watch and enjoy the unique, the unexpected, and the perverse that sometimes tickles our imaginations, you'll enjoy this collection - a collection that could only be crafted by those so intimate and loving of Vegas life and all of its bizarre permutations."
2,"Very disappointing, even for Las Vegas fans","I swear that you're going to be very disappointed by this book. The short stories are mostly at the level of a college literary journal, and only one or two stories are memorable stand-outs that show off a modicum of creativity. (Who knew that reading about the highs and lows of gambling could be so unexciting? I gamble every time I go to Las Vegas, and I'm also a fan of contemporary fiction, yet I was bored to death by these stories.)Buy Mike Tronnes' excellent anthology, Literary Las Vegas, instead."
3,"ok... if you're a dancer, professional or otherwise","This workout is frustrating. It is advanced,very little time is spent ( if any) on teaching viewers the moves.And understandably so, it would takes hours to illustrate the numerous amount of moves involved.It's complicated and intense. It's like trying to follow a freight train going 1000mls an hour.Petra is generally a good instructor, but I think they missed it with this one.But as my title says, it's great if you have your coordination down and are already familiar with some of these movements."
2,Too Much Dance,"You REALLY have to like to dance to enjoy this video. I was under the impression that it was more athletic with dance-like moves, like Petra's Dance Step video. Very disappointing."
5,AWESOME workout video,I would recommend this video to anyone. It may take you few times to learn all the moves but its fun just trying. And once you get the jist of it - you're hooked! It keeps my heart rate up and I have never gotten bored of it - you get out what you put in.
2,Not enough oomph to keep me going,"The steps are fun and challenging, the dancers are good about looking energetic and making it look fun and funky, but that music is putting me to sleep over half the time! I just can't do those steps to that droning music that can barely chug out a beat. It's a major handicap I'm afraid. With better music it would get a much better rating. Oh, except that some of the moves will really tear up your shoes.Definitely don't get this is you are a klutz - the steps are a little challenging and they are fast and you barely have time to learn them before you are going to the next complicated set of steps."
3,A so-so product,"Glad I got this footrest at a deep discount because it's definitely not worth the full price. The product is plastic and is very lightweight which means I have to have my feet in the very center of the footrest or it will rock back. Also the tilt is difficult, but not impossible, to adjust. On the plus side, it's nice and wide and it does elevate my feet, which is why I bought it. Overall it gets the job done but without a lot of panache."
3,Only 1 pony,"I read the reviews after my daughter got this for Christmas last night. I see most got a few ponies to go with the set. Ours only came with one pony. We paid $30 at a discount store. Not only did she only get 1 pony but the bigger ponies she already has do not work with the play set. The flying part and some other parts only work with this new ""baby"" pony which is a dissapointment. While its still a cute toy and she is having fun, I am not satisfied with the product overall."
2,Threw this in the trash!,"The idea of the playset is cute, but the construction of it is horrible. As other reviewers stated, the two base pieces of the toy do not snap together and stay together, so every time you move this toy it falls apart. For this reason alone I threw it out."
2,Ahhhhh...make it go away!!!,"My 4 year old daughter received this for Christmas. She really enjoyed playing with over the Christmas holiday weekend. It's cute, but not high quality, and way too big.Once it's assembled, it stays that way, with a base approximately 24"" by 18"", and standing at approximately 18"" high. It will have to find a place on the floor or a table, and then stay there. If we've got to relinquish 3 sq ft of floor or table space in our playroom, I'd prefer it be for a toy with more long-term appeal. With any luck, my daughter will tire of it, and we can scavenge the juice bar (which won't click into place on our set), skyride, and ponies, while chucking the rest of it."
1,JUNK,"Too bad! This set looks pretty and full of fantasy . . . . but, it is so junky and will not stay together. I have yet to see any of my 6 girls get any quality playtime out of this nor the other Little Pony set we got at the same time. So for the price this was a rip off. I never see this in one piece - only bits of it strewn around. In contrast - we have a really old pony castle that we got at a garage sale which remains in tact - we get hours of play at a time whenever I take this one off the shelf!"
1,Piece of Junk,Does not stay together. Everytime my daughter tried to put a pony down the slide it would fall off. I know it was not the way I put it together either. It is just held there by the little plastic heart. My sister in law and cousin had the same problem with there. Def. not worth the money.
4,Butterfly Island can be fun.,"This is a typical cheaply constructed My Little Pony playset. It does not stay put together very well and my four year old daughter has a difficult time getting the ponies into the butterfly contraption. However, depsite the technical difficulties, she absolutely loves it, which is why I gave an overall rating of 4. It does provide for imaginative play."
3,"Disappointed, broken within 12 hours.","I gave my daughter this toy for Christmas yesterday and it is already broken. The butterfly swing has to be wound up and it then unwinds when the button is pushed for the music. It just quit working and I thought that my daughter might have over-wound it, but my husband took it apart and the motor works and the music works, but they no longer work together. She is so upset! She is almost six and is not rough with her toys.The slide and the waterfall just snap on and feel really flimsy, but she had fun playing with it for an hour or so before it was all about it no longer working properly. It looks like a lot of fun, and it is really cute.But, overall I'm extremely disappointed with this toy since it's been out of the box fewer than 12 hours and is already broken. I might see if I can return it to Amazon."
2,not durable,"I was very disappointed in this toy. My daughter had to have it for Christmas, so I reluctantly bought it for her despite the price. It falls apart all the time--the pieces snap together rather than screw together. Yes, it was quick to put together, but even quicker to snap apart--and break apart. Within minutes of playing with it, one of the pieces snapped off where it was to join with another piece. Also, it requires batteries only for the music. I had thought that one of the rides was motorized, but that was not the case."
1,Boring and flimsy,"My 3 1/2 year old has a few ponies that she loves to play with and her grandma bought her this toy for christmas. It doesn't really DO anything and it just sits in her room until I try to move it to sweep the floor, then it falls apart when I pick it up. My daughter loves pretend play and dollhouses, but there isn't much pretending with this toy."
4,HEADS UP ON BABY PONIES,I just ordered this item today for my daughter's bday so I can't really rate it but I did want to mention that you can find extra baby ponies in the party section of ToysRUs. They had a bunch at my local TRU. Three in a pack (...)
3,"Cute Music and theme, but need more","I think this is a nice addition to the My Little Pony Set. My daughter likes to play with it, but get frusturated with the ponies falling from their swings when moving. The surfboard and rainbow slide seem to work fine, but I think it needs more moving items on it. Would still purchase again though"
2,JUNKY beyond words,This thing is all over my house. I tried to sit and play with it with my daughter and it just kept falling apart. She had rather play with the box. Do not waste your money.
4,"Finally, a My Little Pony toy worth having!","I bought this toy for my three year old daughter's birthday. I am very pleased with it. There are many activities and wonderful music that makes you feel like you are on a tropical vacation! We have the Rainbow Wishes Amusement Park and that is an awful toy. It is fragile and there is not a lot of entertainment in it. Butterfly Island is a huge improvement over it. It comes with two small ponies which are the only ponies that can spin around the top of the toy. The regular-sized ponies can do all the other activities, such as the surfboard, the drink bar, the dolphin beach and the ride up the waves. There is a storage compartment in the back which is handy to hold all the little pieces that come with the toy. I would highly recommend this toy. My five and a half year old also enjoys playing with it."
1,Don't Buy This,"This cover will protect the body of your sansa but not the screen. It put lots of scratches on my screen, one of them deep."
2,Bird Lemon Squeezer not that good.,The bird lemon squeezer is not all it's cracked up to be. It does does squeeze the juice from a lemon well at all. Save ur money.
2,Walk in My Boots - the Joy of connecting,"Didn't like it. Very personal from her point of view but no life lesson scenario for reader. It was a personal diary and I never finished it. for her , I'm sure it was cathartic but for me I wanted something about teaching connecting to others. A diary doesn't do it."
2,very basic intro for tourists,"This book would be useful only for someone who just wants to be able to exchange a few phrases with Hindi speakers during a trip to India. Only tourist-oriented situations are presented in the dialogs, and even then the vocabulary and the total amount of material presented is extremely small. The tapes are relatively good because the native speakers read each dialog once at a normal pace, then they read the dialog slowly, line by line, so that the learner can repeat and learn pronounciation. Unfortunately, the tapes also contain a lot of filler in English that becomes annoying after repeated listening, and worse yet, in an effort to ""simplify"" the grammar, the tapes (and the book) will teach you some sentences that are not entirely grammatically correct."
5,Strap is just fine,"Arrived in a timely manner, and is just what I needed to start using my heart rate monitor again."
3,Battery life,"There is no way to determine the battery status, nor is there any way to replace the battery once you determine it is dead. After getting wierd and fluctuating pulse readouts, I replaced the device (strap and sending unit) and now I get reliable readings again."
5,Exactly what I needed,This is what I needed to replace my medium strap. It is just the right size for me and very comfortable to wear. Easy to attach to your transmitter too.
1,Does not fit all monitors,"This strap does not fit all T31 monitors. The product information suggests that it does, but the newer line of T31 straps are different. Also, you should know that if you buy this getting help from polar is almost impossible (I emailed several times with no response)."
1,Polar T31 Replacement Elastic Strap,I returned this item because it was overpriced. By that I mean the strap was 5.00 but shipping and handling was 5 times the price of the strap!
2,Care,The Polar has different varieties of straps so make sure before ordering that this is the one that you need.
2,Extra-small is SOOOOOOO small!!,"I was so happy to find I could replace my stretched-out strap without having to buy a brand new HRM or transmitter. Based on other reviews and the fact that the Medium strap was at its smallest position for me, I ordered the extra small. Imagine my surprise when I measured the new XS strap and found it to be only 10"" long...at its maximum length!I am pretty small (30"" around where the strap should fit) and this thing could not be any tighter. It's off to the craft store to go get some additional elastic length and sew it to the strap.Please, Amazon, put the size ranges for the straps on the product page for ALL the sizes!"
2,Its a strap.,"I got this strap for my polar f6 when the standard medium strap was just to big, this small strap is NOT that small and was to big for my 35in chest. Im not a small girl by any stretch of the imagination but this strap is to big for me.I wish that polar would come out with a velcro strap like on other products.I just cut the end off removing a few inches and sewed it back down, until the elastic wears out Im not going to waste my money."
5,Last Night and Every Night,"Need your second wind or need to fill the dance floor - this is the one for you. No matter the time of day this will get your heart pumping and your feet tapping. A must for dancers - Swing, Shag or freestylers. baba boop baba boop POW POW!!!"
3,perspective of a pez collector,"I was disapointed that they did not show the acctual factory in the making of PEZ section and also in the fact that it took FOREVER to scroll through the encyclopedia section. I did enjoy the interviews of the Pez collectors at the convention. This is a fun dvd, but not as fun as it could of been."
1,Not impressive!,"I have travelled to Le Mont St. Michel 6 times and everytime I am amazed! It is one of the most amazing places I have travelled to in the world. That being said, this DVD does not do it justice. In fact, it seems as though it was a high school production. Not to mention the excessive price for such rubbish. Look for something else."
4,i love it,This bra is awesome . Its comfortable and fits perfectly. It can be difficult to find bras that fits this well in my size without having to spends 70$ .so I'm very pleased. Plus it came earlier then expected!
3,Not as pictured,I received the rubber hanger for the muffler instead of what was pictured. I believe the correct part number for the rubber hanger is 35119. The holes on the hanger are very small and make installing it pretty challenging.
3,Recommended by Bosch,I have Bosch stainless steel appliances and thought that this would be the ultimate protection.There is nothing wrong with it but you might find a spray product in your local store that does just as well
1,It's not what it think it is.,You are lead to believe that it's a documentary on LSU football. It's just a video of clips for NFL scouts to look at.

1,Cheap material,"I did not like the product, the metal is very thin, it looks very cheaply made, and the openings are so thin that they will probably clog very easily here where I live.I will return."
3,"Looks good, inconsistent performance","I wound up buying three of these whistles (I played Captain von Trapp in a local version of Sound of Music...'nuff said). They look like the real thing, but each one had a different sound. One was so loud and piercing that using it indoors (admittedly, not it's original intention) was impossible. Another worked sometimes and made very little sound other times. The third, in true Little Bears' House style, was just right.It's very affordable and would work perfectly on a boat, so long as you get a ""good one"". I didn't try to return the one that didn't work, but suspect it wouldn't have been a problem."
2,Cheapo,"I bought this whistle thinking I could wear it around my neck. The cheap metal necklace (lanyard) broke the first day I tried to wear it and the whistle was lost. Yes, it is inexpensive, but with shipping I was out over $20 for something I used for less than a day ... what a waste of money!"
3,A nice addition ot the main book...,"This manual is a nice addition to SICP, if you are trying to teach yourself. Some points are clarified, and there are some additional exersices. Unfortunatly, in this edition, the extended exercises were removed, and they were pretty cool (implementing object oriented programming,for example). Nevertheless, you can download the extended exercises from the book's web site, so all is not lost, but I was disapointed that they were not printed in the instructor's manual this time."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Although I love the underlying book on which this booked is based, I hated this so-called instructor's manual. It simply seems like the authors wanted to make more money by writing a book that rests only on the name of the original. It is in NO way an instructor's manual. As I say above, don't waste your money."
1,STOP!,before you buy this product look at your stereo... this does not fit my 99 4runner limited... wast of time and money... shame on you Amazon.
4,Fun game,"Fun game. Like the cartoon. It is a little repetitive but you can change which alien you will beand use their different powers. Challenging with different levels.Overall, a good buy for children who like the show."
4,"Loads of fun for all ages, easy game to play too","This is a lot of fun to play, no matter your age.It's what I'd call ""gamer lite"". It's a gamer type game, but very easy to play.My only gripe *SPOILER* is that you only get to play as 5 or 6 of the aliens.One of my favorites, Upgrade, isn't even in there.*SPOILER* Even at the end of the game when Ben gets all the aliens back, we never even see them!I hope they do a sequel to this, and include all the aliens."
5,Terrific Deal!!,Bought game with some hesitation but glad with end result.Cant find this game at any major dept stores. Very cost effective purchase. Me and my son love it!!!
5,An Annual Spiritual Checkup,"Chuck Pierse and Rebecca Systema have equipped the church with tools to enable us to obey Heb 12:1 ""... lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us..."" and Eph 4:27 ""Neither give place to the devil.""Whether your a fairly new Christian, or a mature soldier in God's army, all Christians can benefit from a regular spiritual spring cleaning as prescribed in this book."
1,Please Use Biblical Discernment,"On the surface, this book appears to fit into biblical principles. Except for one thing, one of the authors uses his or her young son as a Christian ""medium"" to located demonic spirits and report what the spirits are doing. The Bible is quite clear on the use of mediums [Deuteronomy 18:9-12], even those who claim to be speaking for God [Acts 16:16-19]. This book has charismatic overtones. If you read this book, have your Bible open so that you can readily compare everything to Scripture. The devil loves to mix a ""little"" deception with ""a lot"" of Christian doctrine."
3,Not for me,I really looked forward to this book after reading a review in the NY Times. However when I started to read it I became instantly bored. Although I was familiar with the majority of authors that Kelly covers I could not keep up with all the details he provides about their lives and the literature the wrote and was lost.The chapters or sections are short which is good and he covers many people. I think if you really love or appreciate classical literature then this would be a good book for you. It just wasn't my cup of tea.
1,I was lost for most of the book!,Each chapter opens with a scene that is poorly developed with action and details I was forced to decipher. It made me wonder if I skipped a few pages of exposition. Needham tried to write a mystery/romance. But the only mystery was her plot. Also I didn't like the bickering of the femminist heroine Elizabeth. She was annoying. This book is a definite raspberry (stick your tongue out and blow).
2,It was OK. It had its moments,"I didn't dislike the authors writing style. The book moved along and though the characters were thin, I liked them. I haven't read the previous books with some interconnecting characters and I wonder if I had read them first if these characters would have seemed fuller. Even the interconnected characters were light weight in this book.Overall, this is a fluffy, feel good book, that moves fast and leaves the world in a good place."
3,Front clear cover... totally scratched.,"Front clear cover... totally scratched.Don't know how, but it looks like sandpaper was rubbed all over the front of it. Dont' know how to rate it, because it works just fine."
4,Works well,"We mounted it outdoors near a pool. Lettering makes it legible at over 50 feet; probably would still be fine at 100'. Easy to mount, fine in bad weather. The only problem was that the hour hand was not pointing directly at the hour at that hour (i.e., it was a couple of marks off). We were able to pop off the crystal and move it slightly. Been fine ever since."
2,Cheap Clock Mechanism,"Good: Large, clear, easy to read.Bad: Same small cheap plastic clock module (single AA battery, about 2""x2"", labeled ""Quartz, Made in China"") used to power most $6 wall clocks. Doesn't keep good time, and wears out in 1-2 years.Wish I could find a quality battery powered analogue wall clock. This isn't it."
1,"Piece of junk, poorly packed","I have three problems that others have also mentioned:1. The clock comes in a carton with an open front, exposing the plastic face. Amazon throws it unprotected into the shipping carton, so the face gets scratched up in transit.2. The hands are misaligned. When the minute hand is at 12, the hour hand is between two numbers.3. It's not waterproof. One hard rain and your clock is toast.I should have heeded the earlier comments. Learn from my mistake!"
5,Perfect for city living.,"If you live in a city or condo type atmosphere and need quick access to your bike, this is a useful product. The design is sleek and sturdy, with no waste.The only consideration you should have when buying this is the weight of your bike. If you mount this vertically, you'll need the strength to pick up your bike by the handle bars and seat and guide the front rim onto the hook at the top of the rack. Most street/touring and hybrids shouldn't be a problem. You may want to check your fitness levels if you're rolling on an aluminum frame, old school mountain bike."
2,Not complete problem,"This book, while it does contain all the essientials of InstallShield Developer, lacks a complete index, making it extremely difficult to look up what you want to know about.It also is a beginners books and has very little about how to create an upgrade package.The Table Of Contents is a poor replacement for a complete index."
2,Too much InstallScript coverage.,"The author knows his stuff, but I was really disappointed with this book. I want to use the InstallShield IDE to quickly modify Microsoft Installer attributes.The linkage between these two was poorly described. I also wanted to see more discussion of typical installation scenarios - multiple files installed in multiple locations depending upon existing applications (plug-ins, etc) instead of the standard Program Files folder for a single application. Also a discussion of tracking/updating revisions in the registry would have been useful.I'd have liked to see more stress put on teaching the MS Installer and it's attributes. This book was tailored more toward the Standard InstallShield user. Many basic principles and quite a discussion about InstallScript."
1,Nothing On Windows Installer - Take It Out Of The Title!,"Purchasing and reading this book proved to be a waste of time and money. If I were only interested in writing InstallShield setups, it would have had some value. As software distribution has been swinging over to Windows Installer, I purchased it with the hopes of finding something of value on that technology. I was very dissapointed to find nothing of value; only a brief introduction, and absolutely no hint of how to apply the technology to a real world situation. That was left to the reader to figure out. This one definitely will not stay on one of my shelves."
5,Excellent viewing,This volume of Agatha Christie's Poirot: Volume 8 has very captivating stories. The stories are not too long or too short. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed them.
2,"Agatha Christie's Poirot, sets 4-8",When Sets 1-3 each are boxed sets that have several shows on them but the latter numbered dvd's have only one show on each dvd. It feels like a rip off and even though I would love to see them I returned them.
4,"The ""Asian Contagion"" Reviewed.","A simple yet far reaching book about the ""Asian Contagion"" and currency crisis of the late '90's. You should first read ""The Vandals Crown"", then this book, followed by ""The Chastening"". You'll then have a complete and chronological history of numerous currency crises involving the IMF, World Bank, and the major geopolitical figures. Fascinating foundation of fundamentals in action for anyone interested in trading the FOREX markets."
4,Good lamp for my purpose,"The initial photo of this item is of the ""touch on/off"" version, so I was really disappointed that the lamp that arrived has the on/off switch. To be fair, the discription of the lamp does not mention the type of switch. The bulb and general lamp appearance are excellent, and I enjoy the quality of the light produced. The adjustability of the lamp is limited to being all in one plane - it cannot turn, and once it is adjusted, it is best to leave it that way. The lamp serves my purposes."
4,Sunlight Desk Lamp,I purchased a lamp like it several years ago for my home...and loved how well it lights up my work space without causing glare on the monitor. The one I purchased previously has a touch 'on' base feature this lamp doesn't have but that hasn't prevented me from being glad I finally have one for my work space at the office.
1,No refund,Sent the item back but received no refund after 3 weeks and no reply. The seller is not willing to refund so be careful.
2,Glorified flourescent,I know better than to believe that you can get 150 watts of light using only 27 watts of power but I hoped that it would at least be comparable to a 60 watt bulb. Not even close. Natural sunlight emulation? Maybe on a very cloudy day.
2,What you get is not what you see.,"What you get is not what you see. The first image is of the touch lamp where you touch a base and the light comes on. In addition it comes with an outlet on the back of the base. Lastly the black poles that hold the lamp were ceramic. What I got was the lamp that had a physical switch, plastic poles and no back power outlet. I had the touch lamp and it was amazing so I replaced it based off of the picture and now I'm stuck with this overpriced and unwanted lamp."
1,Broken in Six Months!!!,I bought this lamp this past July. Rather handsome but I wasn't very happy about it's being difficult to adjust. I was using it as a bedside reading lamp.Two days ago I went into the bedroom and found that the vertical post had snapped in two about three inches above the base. Obviously the lamp head itself was too heavy.Very disappointed!! I also bought a spare bulb for it! Guess I'll never use it. This is definitely a don't buy.
2,Cheap,"The light works fine, but is very cheaply made. I understand ""that you get what you pay for"", but I was somewhat disappointed with this item. The adjustments are ""teeth"" that are brought together with an easy to turn thumb screw. There is no horizontal adjustment for the head of the light. I think if I were to adjust this very many times, that the teeth would wear out. The bulb works as advertised and provides nice even light. If you need an light that you are going to adjust often for different applications, then keep looking. If you are going to set it and be done, then this would be one to consider. The lack of adjustment in the head of the lamp is a huge downside to me."
4,Repeal of my previous remarks,This product is a good work lamp for a regular or computer deskThe seller was very helpful with my inquire about the wrong picture of this item on the web page.I would recommend this lamp a very good buy and great assistance from the seller..
4,"Good light, looks cheap","Bought this as my desk lamp. The positives: The light is bright and does not appear ""fluorescent"". There is no flickering or buzzing. The touch switch works like a charm. Easy to adjust, nicely weighed. Emits very low heat (important when you live in Fl and you do not want to have a heat source when you work). The light is neutral, and white. I am not sure if I would call it ""Sunlight"", but it is more pleasant to the eye than the fluorescent ones. If you are used to halogen or you have halogen lights juxtaposing it, you will see the difference, but other than that, I'm ok with it.Cons: Cheap appearance. Plastic is nicely finished & colored, but you can tell that it is made from materials from the bottom of the quality range. It does NOT affect the functionality tho, and it will only bother you if you are perfectionist. Overall, a decent desk lamp."
3,OK lamp for the price,The lamp is bright and the base is good and steady but the adjustable arms on this lamp look and feel extremely cheap. The plastic used to create them is extremely low quality. The lamp arms should have be made with some type of metal or a thicker plastic. It works though so I cant complain too much :)
3,Too little on the early years!,"The author became a fan in 1970. Well, that's about the time when I was about to give up on the Pretty Things. That being the case I would have loved to read more about the early years, as well as seen more pictures from those same years (there's not a picture of the young Viv Prince in the book...).There is no denying that the band has done quite a lot of good music over the years (if you enjoy harmony singing - which I don't) but taste vary as everyone knows. So the bottom line is I for one would have liked it if the two first albums had been treated with same thoroughness as the rest."
2,Sherlock Holmes,I purchased this book for use in the most advanced class in an English Camp in the Czech Republic. I feared that the English would be too hard but they had already read The Hound of the Baskervilles so it was suitable.
5,Great fun!!!,"A great recording by a great, creative band. I honestly love every track. It's obvious these guys have a lot of fun."
5,Sizzling and Soaring,"WOW! I own the first two Big Phat Band albums and I knew what to expect when I purchased ""The Phat Pack"" and put it in my CD player for the first time. I was NOT expecting that it would blow the first two albums out of the water. If you thought that this band couldn't get any better, think again. Gordon Goodwin's writing has gone to a new level (if that is possible) and the band plays his charts which such flavor and virtuosity I can't explain in words. This band can bring it, and they've brung it home once again. If you buy ONE big band album the rest of your life, make it this one. AND there is a bonus DVD. WOW!"
3,Repeating the same formula with non creative compositions,Some solos are incredible (notably by Eddie Daniels) but maybe a long list of tracks may have made listening to this CD into an experience that got me tired.I missed the lively experience and creativeness when I sat to hear 'Swinging the Fences'.
5,The best yet!,"I have been waiting for a new Big Phat Band album for a couple of years. I received my copy of Phat Pack yesterday and man was it worth the wait. This album is pure class fom the first note to the last. I am also really impressed with the bonus DVD - a surround mix, performance video's, leaders commentary, pictures, make your own mix, charts and even a trivia game where you can unlock a hilatious skit of the band going to play in Vegas. (It took me a few goes to get the correct answers though). This is pure entertainment of the highest level - talk about value for the dollar."
3,Not as Expected,This season was okay but they must have changed writers because most of the episodes were really not that funny. I think season 4 was the last good season for this show ...
5,Teds Review,The Lens is as one would expect from Nikon I would say that it would be hard to find a product that is similar to the the one being reviewed that could compare.
5,Best all day lense,"I bought my D80 12 months ago. The Tamron 28-75 2,8f came with it, which I returned after 200 test shots due to low contrast and serious missing sharpness. I used my ~20 years old 37-70mm 'til June when I bought this one. Since I am more then happy. The 24-85 mm is what it is, the 2,8 is in daily life more a 3,5. This lense is sharp, fast, bright, perfect in handling, delivers perfect images. I own some older Nikon lenses as my 1st SLR was a Nikon, this is my No1-all-day lense. All other is to blame at the person using the lense ;)"
4,Take a dip in the well-weather'd waters of folk-rock,". . . . take it slow reading this book. That way, the relatively few jaded pronouncements won't come at you quickly enough to be (much) annoying. For there is an abundance of very good writing here-and some of it is poetic. To his credit, Mr. Unterberger doesn't become nearly so harsh..."
3,"The case of the tell-tale extra ""o.""","Often the criticisms aimed at writers like Richie have this underlying attitude of ""Man! I could, like, do this SO much better!"" In virtually all cases, I can guarantee that we'll never get to find out.The review here by Tom Kiseleski sounds like a comment by a ""Communications"" major with too short an attention span to call ""short."" It is that tell-tale extra ""o"" in ""booring"" that conveys a used book stall of information.Nice book. Yes, slower in pace than the trailer for an action- adventure movie, I fear that is true. But a nice book nonetheless."
1,Heard it all before (Better),"As a rule, folk rock records are crummy generic ditties with nothing to recommend them. The formulaic jangling guitars and meaningless lyrics have a lame, dated feel. But the stories behind the folk rockers could have been interesting in the right hands. Unfortunately `Turn! Turn! Turn!' is devoid of any new or real content. Okay-to-cruddy interviews (= filler) masquerade as research. The constant harping on Bob Dylan and the Byrds gets downright irritating."
1,Extremely Bad Taste,"Boring, poorly produced, bad tasted. Our expectation for Leon had just got less and less. This album is another rush production of the same old music for the last 3-4 years. Garbage."
1,Pretentious album,"For the cover of this album, Leon Lai and his producer appears to be aiming for something more chic. However, the effect is pretentious. Besides, what matters most is the music, which is definitely substandard. Both the arrangement and the singing are uninspiring. I'm afraid this sloppily produced album cannot rescue Leon Lai's declining career."
1,Bland and substandard,This cd is very disappointing. The music is bland and the songs are of the same old type. Leon Lai's ordinary vocals just can't cope. This is a substandard cd without much substance.
4,Problems with CD payback,"The book and CD set make a formidable combination and a great study guide, but I have had difficulties playing the CDs. The only direct way to list and select the 532 audio tracks on a PC is to open Microsoft Media Player and insert the appropriate disc. Going via disc 6 is enough to start hating the climactic finish to the Great Gate of Kiev from sheer repetition!My difficulty is in playing the movies, which appear to be .DXR files. Can any fellow-sufferer help me here? They simply won't run for me. All that runs is the Musorgsky/Ravel under Quick-Time."
1,CDs not compatible with MAC OS X,"As I tried to install the CDs on my mac, following the instructions, a message pops up saying that the study of orchestration can't be played because the Classic environment is not available anymore...after contacting the publisher, turns out the CDs are only compatible with Mac 10.6 Snow Leopard and not Lion...which I doubt as I am using Snow Leopard still...THey are considering an update soon but not in any near future...really disappointed in the purchase especially as this is to be high standard...really too bad..SO the only option is to have an earlier Mac version or run it on a windows system- which apparently, if reading the other comments, doesn't come easy either- please update your CDs!!!"
3,Not for Mac OS X,"The system requirement indicate that the setup program will work with Mac System 8.1 or later. Unfortunately it will not work with OS X. You have to have a machine that will run in ""Classic."" Without the setup program installed, you will not be able to watch the videos which have an .dxr extension. Audio examples will play, but not worth the full price."
5,Excellent set for teaching yourself orchestration.,"I bought the main text, the workbook and the cd's and then took a college level orchestration course as an independent study. I got good marks in the course and needed minimal help from my professor. The cd's are worth it because standard repertoire is used, allowing you to easily remember concepts by recalling familiar works.After reading a section, doing the related workbook exercises and listening to examples, I felt well prepared for each meeting with my prof. The only thing that bugged me was the author's somewhat slavish (IMHO) devotion to Gunther Schuller."
1,Insufficient to pass exam - does not cover all exam topics,"I picked up this study guide to prepare for the MPLS exam for Ciscos CCIP. I read through it in 2 weeks and signed up for the exam only to find out that I picked a study guide completely insufficient for the exam: The study guide misses out on a few important topics, such as loop prevention when using BGP as a CE-PE protocol, and treats many topics, such as MPLS over ATM networks, BGP and MP BGP to implement VPNs, and convergence issues in frame and cell mode, just to name a few, to lightly. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it gave me a broad overview of MPLS/VPNs, with a lot of holes to be filled though, something I had to do by reading other books on the subject.I eventually passed the MPLS exam using the CCIP MPLS study guide from Cisco press - even if this book takes longer to read, anyone who wants to pass this exam is better off just taking this book."
1,This Book Just SUCKS!!!,"HELLO SPELL CHECK. THIS HAS GOT TO HAVE THE MOST MISTAKES IN IT REGARDING SIMPLE SPELLING TO FORMULAS AND CONSTANT REPETITIVE CONFIGURATIONS I HAVE EVER SEEN. I THINK THAT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE WRITER DID NOT TAKE THE EXAM HIMSELF, THE BOOK WAS BLACK AND THE EXAM WAS WHITE. IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THE EXAM DO NOT, DOOOOO NOOOOT BUY THIS BOOK. HEY BUDDY YOU MISSED A TONE OF STUFF THAT JUST HAPPENED TO BE IN THE EXAM AND NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN YOUR BOOK. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE AN ENTERPRISE AND SERVICE PROVIDER INSTRUCTOR OF CISCO TECHNOLOGIES. NO WONDER YOU WORK FOR YOUR SELF NOBODY WOULD HIRE YOU. I AM ANGRY THAT I SPENT ALL THAT MONEY ON YOUR BOOK AND GOT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUT OF IT."
4,Error Within / Dead Race,"These are really fun movies. It's a good example of just how entertaining a low budget movie can be.This is celebrated B movie entertainment. Simple plots, plenty of gore; feature secluded Space evil, and all the other elements that make these movies simple and entertaining Cult Classics. Although these aren't movies for everyone, most horror fans will appreciate them.You should definitely check these out if you're a fan of horror, Cult Classics, and especially if you're a B movie fan."
1,gas caps for 1976 bronco,Would not fit my vehicle. These gas caps are for a latter model with a screw in type cap. My vehicle uses a blade type cap.
1,disappointing,"i'm a huge groundhog/mcphee fan and was very disappointed with this release. it's tony on accoustic guitar. the first few songs i thought were good, but after that, i lost interest. there is a long, drawn out song about the history of the groundhogs that just rambled. i don't own this cd anymore as i gave it away. i guess there is a point where all these songs sound the same. buy at your own risk."
3,introduction to multiplication,"I bought this for my 2nd grader because it was a package deal when buying Monkey Math which I bought for my preschooler. When it is out, she plays with it and practices her ""times tables""."
2,Bumped up 1 star for some decent FX.,"Swiss-cheese like holes throughout make it a bit silly, as well as some ridiculous death scenes that turn anti-climactic. For example, what could have been a scary scene as two girls try to get out of the evil house from a window, ends with them just passing out and dying from scary gas. Lame. There was one good scene where the crazy lady has her hands down a garbage disposal, but other than that... meh. At least there were some decent special FX so I could give it two stars."
3,Funhouse Of Horrors...,"DARK HOUSE starts out w/ a bloody mass-murder, then turns into a goofy, HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL / 13 GHOSTS-type movie. The middle part is sort of a WESTWORLD / CHOPPING MALL (The computers are malfunctioning!) story w/ holographic ghouls gone wild. Jeffery Combs (RE-ANIMATOR, FROM BEYOND, CASTLE FREAK, THE FRIGHTENERS) hams it up as the owner / genius behind a new haunted house exhibit on the fritz. I was disappointed w/ the mid-section of this one, but the last 15 minutes or so, which include a decent twist and some actual tension, almost save DH from mediocrity. Almost..."
3,Feels like you are in a Funhouse. Worth Watching!,"Dark House is worth a rental (at least). It is one of the better Frightfest Films. After a Childhood ""incident"" a Girl returns to the house where it occured to face her fears with a group of Friends. Upon arriving She feels something is not right. She is correct. Dark House was filled with thrills and was in my opinion well made and entertaining."
5,Great Zippo,I really like the look and feel of this antique brass finish. Great Zippo! I really like the weathered finish & look forward to the finish changing even darker.
2,works but looks trashy,"i thought it would be antiqued brass, like a horn with no laquer on it or a forced patina.it's not, it's a steel lighter with a crummy brass-like spray paint coating.it just feels wrong in my hand (like sticky almost)"
3,Man up and get a new looking one and use it for a few years.,This is like a faux painting with a clear coat on the outside. The clear coat makes it slick. I used some scotch brits pads and roughed it up and wound up taking most of the finish off . . .
4,Its great,I love it but it is messing the brass inside it. I wish it did so it would make it feel you know more authentic
2,Antique finish fades of in 4 days,Had high hopes when i ordered this but the glossy finish just fades off and now i have trouble with the flint.This was supposed to be my first Zippo n am dissapointed.
2,Antique brass zippo,"the antique brass looks very cool, but when i open it the hinge is very wobbly and it also doesn't close completely. I'm thinking i just got a faulty one"
5,Great Instrumental CD,"I use to play this album back in the early 80's on a bluegrass radio show hosted from The University of Alabama; I'd always pick one of these tunes to begin the show. Without a doubt, rather you play the banjo, mandolin, dobro, fiddle, or guitar, you will want to take a crack at figuring out theses tunes. I play banjo and enjoyed the pickin of James Bailey and JD Crowe. Jerry Douglas is on the dobro and most of his breaks are straight ahead. Doyle Lawson plays some of the cleanest notes I have heard him play to date. Also, Bobby Hicks is on the fiddle; what more can you say. You will not go wrong buying this CD."
1,Where's the Action?,"I've been playing racing games since Indy 500 first came out on the original Atari system. After 15 years off, I recently discovered I can still make it around the ice tracks flat out. This wheel, however, isn't even as good as the old Atari hand-held paddles. As noted by other reviewers, the reaction is so slow as to be debilitating. I don't understand why, when the V3 on my PC works so much better. The only reason I gave it even one star was because of the look/feel/programability. All of those features are very cool. But the game play is what concerns me with any controller I buy, and this will be the first one I take back. Really wish I'd taken the 10 minutes to check the reviews here before I bought it."
4,Interact Concept 4 Racing Wheel,"The wheel is rather heavy due to the motors inside and yet the case seems very light. Not a great combination, but with care it is just fine. I don't like the notch in the middle of the wheels travel. It is suppossed to help you find the center position but it can be a real pain. It is good if you have never tried anything else, but if you have, consider carefully."
1,Defective twice!,"This wheel feels and looks great. Unfortunately, I've been through two of them in 5 days, and both lose their calibration during gameplay. I've used it with F1 2000 and Gran Turismo 2, and it happens with both games. I set up the calibration with the wheel's controls and the games', and every time, after about 30 minutes or so, the wheel starts to go off-center. At first it's not a problem, but it gets continually worse until I have to hold the wheel about 45 degrees to the left in order to go straight. So all in all, that makes it pretty useless for these great driving games. I really love the look and feel though, I just wish the thing worked!"
1,Dissappointed Christmas Present,purchased this item for son's Christmas present & it did not work. Returned the item to PriceCooler 45 days ago & have not received credit for the return. PriceCooler will not return calls or emails regarding such. Buyer Beware!!!
5,works great,Charger works great. I was worried that since my phone is so old that I wouldn't be able to get another charger but this is perfect. Using OEM parts is always a plus.
1,Don't waste your money,A really crappy movie! Sappy storyline that jumps around. Very poor acting! I guess that't what you get when nfl players try to act!
1,"Poorly written, and worst of all, unhelpful","This is a complete waste of money. It's poorly structured and written. I don't question that he knows his stuff, but he does a terrible job of getting it across. So badly that the information in it is useless.Don't waste your money.As an alternative, I highly recommend buying the courseware books from InstallShield. They're about $250, but far far far more useful."
2,For the rest of us...,"Any book from InstallShield will target, market and promote the use of InstallShield's packaging tools. I've found the range of books from InstallShield to only contain approximately 30% of useful material for those not contemplating using InstallShield's development tools.The only book which had a generic focus on Windows Installer has been Mike Gunderloy's book. I say ""had"" because it is no longer in print.If you are not planning to commit your investment in Installshield's products, I would not recommend any book from InstallShield Corporation given cost and the overall content which will be applicable to your MSI development efforts."
5,"We should have built our treehouse, last year!","My husband, three sons and I had so much fun! The illustrations were great, we knew what we were doing every step of the way. I highly reccommend building a treehouse for anyone who has children, especially little boys. I know where my kids are now all the time, they're in the treehouse."
4,"To find the kids, look up",Color pictures of some fantastic tree house ideas. No limits on imagination here. One caution: Don't let the kids see it first! Can't wait to start one of these ideas.
3,"Lively little sketch book, very conversational","Works for kids, works for adults, very clear and very helpful. Very graphics oriented and the sketches make the text very clear.Unfortunately does not even mention escalating tree houses beyond the backyard project - if this were a full-revalation book, you would see the new engineering miracle, the Garnier Limb.We were quite pleased - PS we are hard graders, hardly anything gets a 5."
3,Useful and Fun,"This is more of child-oriented book, with cartoonish pictures and designs best suited for kids. a more serious book about more serious tree houses is called _Home_Tree_Home_ - pro9bably the best book I've found so far."
5,Tree House: I Actually Built!,This is the only tree house construction book that demonstrates simple principles of tree house building rather than prescribed plans and solutions that probably won't fit your situation! The illustrations are easy to understand which is critical for the project to be a parent/child joint initiative. The authors seem to truly care that your house building project will become a pleasant and memorable experience.
4,Tree Houses You Can Actually Build,"There's a lot of info in this book that would have been hard to scramble up on my own. And, is presented in such a way that even a beginning carpenter can put together one of these or just use the info to design one's own. I especially liked the info on the ""extras"" such as rope ladders and other tree house accessories. It's a real ""how-to"" book and I can't wait to get started!"
5,Basic and Excellent,"My kids and I had a blast building our tree house. It's a memory we'll hang onto forever. And I'm guessing the tree house will last nearly as long as the memories!Relying heavily upon this book, we designed and built an extremely sturdy and FUN tree house. The basic drawings, pictures, and instructions in the book provided this amateur with the necessary guidance to erect something that was not only FUNctional, but also safe enough for my kids to play on! ;-)If you're looking to build a tree house, and you're not a master carpenter, I recommend this book!"
4,Excellent for the Basics,"Not being a builder, this gave great ideas for basic approaches towards building a tree house... Everyone's will be different, but this gets you off on the right start... Highly recommended... Not given 5 stars, because the 5-6 ideas are either really basic or quite complex... I started with one of the really basic ones and added on some ideas of my own once the project was under way..."
4,Very Useful Book,"I used the ideas and illustrations in this book to build my daughter a treehouse in our backyard. Although I used my own design, I used many of the tips for tree connections, platform supports, and other information the Stiles provide in their book. It is evident they have a real love for their subject. Since I have a lot more trees on the property, we have plans to continue expanding the treehouse complex. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for treehouse and accessory ideas."
5,Using this book,"we built a ten by ten foot tree-house in our Norway maple, twelve feet up. It's all screwed together with not a nail in it. Two by six by ten, by two by six by ten, then all framed in. Three eighths inch lag bolt into the tree through a slot in the two by sixes so the house can move in the wind. We have patio furniture up there and run power up with a 50' HD extension cord from the shed. A great place to have a glass of wine and watch the sun go down. Oh, sorry, I mean it's great for the kids. You can do it, too."
5,Great Book,Book provides lots of ideas. They can be done by the weekend warrior. We're building one in June for our 7 year old grandson for his birthday.
5,review of conon i450 printer,"Quick service from this seller, great relationship, he emailed me to check on the printer. I had to have a printer that was only 15 inches wide. This one fit my needs. excellent print quality,"
1,A BIG THUMBS DOWN,I LISTENED TO THE ENTIRE CD AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE SONG THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED REMOTELY APPEALING. THESE GUYS SOUND LIKE A DIFFERENT BAND LIVE (NOT BAD AT ALL) BUT THIS ALBUM (THAT I UNFORTUNATELY PURCHASED) IS A BIG LET DOWN
4,good,"Different out look to communicate with our beloved companions, easy to read, bring a lot of read experiences, definately a good tool to open our mind to possible dialogue"
4,Great for anyone who never read the comics (or happen to be missing them),"The book does follow the comics closely, but is far more detailed and explains a lot of things (such as how they got the krana on Lewa). I especially liked how the authoress showed what it was like under the krana's control, and I loved the battle between the Bahrag twins and the Toa.I gave this 4 stars because, although some parts were left out, it made more sense than the comics."
4,"Well, the excerpt sure left me wanting more....","There is something more to this than you will find in your average run-of-the-mill adventure story. It is very descriptive, but does not skimp on the action! Nice work!"
4,Extremely Useful Details and Format,"Graphic Standards should quickly produce more titles in this series. The details are clearly drawn and extremely useful in this format. You get full-color photo examples and comprehensive technical data attached to each system (inlcuding plans, 3D diagrams, etc). A fair comparison would be with the German publication 'Details' which is published monthly (and in larger volumes as well); except this may be somewhat more relevant to architects in the U.S. because virtually all of the projects are in imperial units and in the States. A worthwhile addition to your library."
2,Graphic Standards Details: Openings,I was disappointed upon receiving this nearly $50 book. The format is small (I should have checked the dimension) and needless to say the details are small and not that great. In short its not worth the cost. I would only recommend it if you can get it used for around $20.
5,WORKS GOOD FOR TWO,WE`VE USED IT FOR A YEAR INSTEAD OF OUR BIG OVEN. WE DO CORNBREAD IN A SMALL BLACK SKILLET AND BAKE CAKES IN AN 8X8 PAN. DON`T PUT IN TO MUCH BATTER OR IT WILL OVERFLOW! MAKES REAL GOOD COOKIES!
4,"OK, good results","This isn't quite as easy as the infomercial seems to say. I am still on the learning curve. The buttons have small print and I almost need the book at hand to identify what I need to do. Toast is really nice and fast. Chops come out really very juicy, if not seared. I like that it stops cooking at a set time. If I am away from the kitchen things don't get over done.The broiler pan and rack are very flimsey and tweek in cooking. The pan is aluminum and stains easily. If it will fit, I might just keep the pan from my older toaster oven.I haven't yet had occasion to reheat any pizza. There is a seperate button for that. I hope it does perform as advertized."
5,Missing Parts Makes Unusable,Oven came with missing parts. Shipper to refund my money. I had one years ago that outlived its working life and we loved it as it reheated food without drying it out and served as a toaster too reducing counter space needs.
1,It will last a year.....,"My second one. The first one failed and the factory replaced it with another new unit. This one lasted 13 months, first the toaster portion failed and finally everything went south. Save your money and steer clear of these things."
5,Brilliant!,"Ward Churchill makes a compelling case that should be required reading for anyone trying to understand the narrative of US history from something other than a Euro-centric point of view. He gently, and sometimes not-so-gently peels back layer upon layer veiling your eyes to understand the genocide still occurring in our treatment of the Native Peoples of our own land.This should be required reading!"
1,Bad research from an Indian who isn't,Ward Churchill's bad research is evident in the fact that he can't even spell names correctly. More serious is the fact that Churchill is NOT an American Indian. His tribal membership was honorary and his diatribes have angered the very people for whom he claims to speak. Avoid at all costs and seek real facts from real historians or AIM.
1,Horrible!,"I bought these containers because I wanted to take cream cheese to work in the morning for a bagel. The lids don't fit at all! I ended up having to put them in a baggie to take to work, which ended up getting all gunked up inside with cream cheese and was nasty. I would never buy these again. Bought some other containers, and I am happy to say that the lids close on them."
3,Not as good as I expected,"Read some of Logsdon's work on line. I was rather disappointed with the book. The on line work was better, andmuch of it was in the book. So I skipped over some stories because I'd already read them. I was looking forward to much more, and didn't get it."
5,Chris Miller's Traverse City State Hospital,"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of Traverse City at the turn of the 19th Century, wonderful Victorian Gothic structures and/or old asylums. Chris has turned what is obviously a true labor of love into a highly readable book rich in interesting history and illustrated by a great many rare photographs of the old Insane Asylum and its campus grounds. The book is unusually well planned and presented in such a way that the reader feels he is on a personal tour of this immmense and historical facility. You won't be able to put this one down! On a scale of 1-5, this informative and enjoyable book is a 10! Thanks to the author for researching and publishing this truly fine history of a fascinating institution from its construction in the late 1800s to its present rejuvination and continued utilization as a commercial complex with residential cottages. Well done, Chris!"
3,nursery color book,"I was disappointed with this coloring book. I thought it would be a full-size book, but it's small. Great for taking along on trips, but for home use, probably need something larger."
1,very poor quality,"A friend of my downloaded this album for me and I was very disappointed in the sound quality. Nothing had been done to eliminate surface noise or scratches. It is evident that someone just recorded the album without any effort to eliminate these imperfections. You can even hear the noise between tracks, which tells me that someone just put the album on to play and that was it. The album itself is very good and certainly worth having, but not with such poor audio quality. I don`t know why there are two different choices (Amazon does not explain) when they both have the same number of songs and the same imperfections."
5,educational and fun toy,Bought this toy (and the set with the dragon) for my brother who teaches world history. He and his students (8th grade) think they're great.
2,"Great, if you want to be more scared than you already are","I would NOT recommend this book to anyone who is pregnant for the first time. When you're in a state where you feel a confusing bunch of things and are hungry for information, you need to read materials that will comfort and empower you, NOT books as alarmist and cold as this one. In the first 20 pages alone, there were at least five separate paragraphs of all the horrible things that could happen if you do or don't do one thing or another. When you're in those first stages of pregnancy, when you're nervous enough as it is, you don't need a book to freak you out any more than you already are. Yes, you have to be careful, and knowing what is good and bad for you is important. But there are ways to convey that message (with warmth, humor, or a sense of comfort), and this book doesn't do any of those things."
1,Not everything!,"OK, So I bought this book along with many others during my 4th pregnancy, thinking it would tell me things the other books didn't....well, it not only rehashes everything already in the Pregnancy Bible (aka What to Expect...) it actually left out alot of key-information that a first time mom or dad should know! I felt the title was very deceiving."
2,Disappointing,"The writer has considerable talent but has come up with a disappointing book. Inspite of a promising beginning, the plot meanders along predictable lines. Perhaps in an attempt to be as scary as Hannibal, the author has included a scene where the villain wears a hannibalesque mask and another where he carries on a phone conversation with the heroine at a carnival like setting from a close distance. As a reader, I would appreciate some originality from an author rather than 'inspired' themes.Some of the actions by the characters in the plot defy common sense. Why did Melissa not take a security team with her when she went to catch Adalwolf at the theater? Just because he speaks from a voice box, she believes that Adalwolf has no voice?Moreover, the fourth reich wannabe villain plot has been repeated ad nauseum and no longer holds an appeal to readers of today. This plot would have worked in the 60's maybe but definitely not today."
3,"KIND OF OKAY, I GUESS","I got this as a gift and didn't think I was going to like this but I didn't hate it. Mostly books that are about TV shows that have gone off the air feel kind of forced and depressing like a biography of the Olsen Twins or something but even though this has NOTHING to do with the Seinfield show it was kind of interesting. There sure are a lot of weird people out there looking for an excuse to have a party, that's for sure. I guess this isn't supposed to be a comedy book it's supposed to be like a travel guide to this one little corner of Americana and if that's what it's trying to do it's pleasant enough. Three stars, why not."
4,Fun book!,"Book was full of fun facts about Festivus. Good background for anyone searching for alternative holidays. Not expensive either, a plus."
5,Festivus received on time,"I was very happy with my purchase from Amazon - was not expecting it to be received before Christmas, but it came in very good time and in excellent as new condition"
2,not that there's anything wrong with it...,"This was okay, I guess. It doesn't really have much to do with the ""Seinfeld"" show, so if you're a fan you may not be thrilled with it. It is kind of sweet, but it's more likely to make you smile a little here and there, rather than actually howl. Not terrible, not great."
2,"I wouldn't call it a Feat of Strength, but...","I did like Miss Festivus. On the whole, I don't think it will knock the socks off anyone but the most rabid fan of that television show we all miss so much: it's a standard cash-register book like 'Real Men Don't Eat Quiche' or the 'Preppy Handbook', although thinner than both of the aforementioned.But it's ALMOST worth buying just for Jerry Stiller's introduction: Frank Can'tstandya is one guy I would definitely have at my party on the 23rd."
2,Kinda Dry,"Disappointing that a book with its roots in SEINFELD is so straight-forward and lacking in laughs. Dry like a high school textbook. And while it does a good job covering the way fans celebrate Festivus, I found myself skipping over parts of it."
2,"NO, VIRGINIA, THIS IS NOT A GOOD FESTISVUS BOOK","I think the Festivus Grinch came and stole all the funny out of this book here. It reads flat, like a high school science textbook. Its also a little mean spirited in the way it makes fun of people out in the middle of the country who just want to celebrate a little in their own way - but it tries to make them look stupid. Mean + Not Funny = no thank you."
1,WHERE'S THE FUNNY? NOT HERE!,"This one is disappointing. Kind of a rip off. Almost no jokes. It's mostly stories about people who celebrate it in weird ways, so it's like watching a lot of local TV news human interest stories. I liked that other Festivus book better, the Real Festivus. That's more interesting stuff, about the wacko who actually wrote the Seinfeld episode, and it's a lot funnier. I'm going to give this one to my mother in law."
1,Not funny,"Wow, did Allen Salkin get lucky. He must be related to Jerry Stiller or something. From his writing, I'd say that JS's involvement is the only reason he got a book deal.This book reads like a 9th grade term paper-- and a poor one at that.What a lame book!"
2,DISAPPOINTING,"I don't make a lot of money, so if I shell out fifteen bucks for a book I kind of want it to be good. And this is just okay. The cover looks great with that funny Frank floating head, but after that it's kind of a letdown. The cat was kind of cute, but the stuff about the Romans confused me - who cares? And I guess it's nice people around the country are celebrating it, but I already knew that. Festivus is a joke holiday that comes from a comedy show, so I kind of wanted this to be more entertaining."
5,Pant-wetting funniness!,"Seriously, you'll need to be wearing a Depends (make that two) whilst reading this book! Allen Salkin and Jerry Stiller make a great comedic duo. After I read the book I read Allen Salkin's blog- this guy is hilarious! I am totally going to have my own Festivus party now. I need to train for thumb wrestling (read the book and you'll understand) Festivus for the rest of us!"
1,travesty,"Bill Laswell's production tries to make Fela sound like early 80's disco. There are dubbed on parts. Probably a misguided attempt at making Fela seem new wave or something. YUCK! There is an undoctored version of this, listen to that instead."
5,Lives up to it's claims.,"Goes through nails like they're not there. The only feedback you get is the shower of burning-hot metal chips that cascade out of the drill hole. Haven't had a bind yet, even drilling through century-old doug fir joists and rafters."
3,quality of product,"I ordered these a bit too big, my fault. I just think that even if they had fit they were a little stiff. To bad because I liked the look of them."
5,great buy,very satisfied I will buy this product again love the smell of it and get a lot of attention while I am wearing it
4,"Nice, pleasant book","I like this book, because one dosent feel like the author tries to put in more or less irrelevant stuff to make the text take up more pages, like it can be seen in some books of American origin. I bought it on the nice reviews instead of the pensum-recommended book, Housecroft, and Im not disappointed at all. However, I cant give it 6 stars, since I havent read it all, and dont know the covering of all the subjects."
1,Confusing information on book,"Apparently this page is selling two different books. After reading the description, I was confident I was buying the combined edition text book, but when I received my package what I really bought was a set of map notes. If you buy the hardcover version, you apparently get the textbook, but if you buy the paperback, it's just the map notes. I went back to see how I could have made this mistake, and the only thing on the page to tip me off was that the package would weigh 4 ounces and the book was only 72 pages long. Everything else on this page makes it sound like you are buying the textbook, but there's a good possibility that you actually are not. Be aware."
2,Interesting,"This book was used for school purposes, but what I found interesting were the massive amounts of errors. There are historical errors, name errors, grammatical and spelling errors to name the least. A poor job was obviously done editing and reviewing the material in this book. The only upside was that the content was quite interesting history wise (when it was correct). Also, on a final note, there were many important historical events left out (e.g., Armenian Genocide of 1918), most likely out of political fear."
1,Absolutley Terrible,"This book is filled to the brim with wrong facts, terrible sources, and just wrong information. Anyone with any knowledge of this era would see that there are blatant lies in it. It has one of the Worst Anti-Catholic Bias's I have ever seen. It constantly bad mouths the church and tells lies. It is Absolutely Terrible. It is obvious that the person who wrote this has some beef with the church and just want to make everyone else think it is the most terrible institution. It praises anything that is against the church and never says anything good about the church at all. Never buy this or any of it's editions. This book should be boycotted not only by the Catholics around the World but also by the people who don't want their innocent children being lied to in a textbook something that should be trusted!!I am currently working on a paper that shows many of the misinformation and shows the truth. So far I am only 23 pages into the book and I have 8 pages written already!"
5,GREAT Ghost Story,"I just finished watching this movie and was very pleased. If you like a scary ghost story movie without a lot of special effects and hoopla, this is for you. The atmosphere was dark and creepy and the plot was well thought out. I'm very glad I bought this movie."
3,it was ok...nothing great or even new,"A nurse tends to special needs children and starts to notice strange things happening....It was ok overall. The movie didn't introduce anything new to the genre and the effects weren't great. There is just nothing that really stands out about the movie. The acting is ok; but nothing spectacular and at times seems wooden. The pacing was slow thoughout the first half of the movie. Once the ""evil"" was revealed we felt a bit disappointed. We were expecting a bit more and instead we got...eh'. I don't want to ruin it for those who want to see it; but just don't expect too much. I guess wer were just expexting a bit more since it had Fangoria's name on it and the magazine is known for horror...should have known better."
4,"Refreshing, fun and delightful!","I finished this book in two days! I simply could not put it down. The characters were intelligent the dialoge was mature and it was worth the purchase. I've found many african american books to be very typical...this book would be a great movie with the right director and cast! I'm looking forward to reading more from Crystal Downs.Very well written...I found myself smiling and feeling the full range of emotions the characters felt. I just wish the love scene was a little longer..LOL.Great job Crystal...I've never written a review, but was moved to do so. Thank you for sharing your talent!"
3,"Great sound, irritating grills",Beautiful sound throughout the range. Awesome power. But those grills keep falling off; hyper-irritating. Had to affix them with duct tape. Would have been a 5-star without this issue.
3,"Priced High End, Design is flawed.",Just another unhappy polk customer. I have two pairs (ugh!) of these in my backyard. All four speakers have the grills falling out of them. At the high end price they are selling these I expected more. Now I am forced to tryand jerry rig something to attempt to keep the grills in. The white speakers have a black speaker face so with the white grill off they stand out like a sore thumb.
3,Joan,If taken as directed it does control your appetite to some extent. I have yet to find the ultimate appetite suppresant.
3,Was just okay,"I love Kubert's art on this one. I collect all of the Ultimate line, and for the most part they are really good reads. I was expecting a lot from this series after the big announcement that Orson Scott Card would be writing it. While I think it is a solid story, it is a bit of a letdown because of the caliber of the writer penning the tale. To be fair, this is his first comic script attempt. I would pick this one up, just don't prepare to be blown away by it."
2,Too many easy cliches,"I was really disappointed in this one. There were many scenes that really just don't make that much sense. The dialog between tony and his black friend when they meet just doesn't make sense and is written poorly IMHO. There are things that happen that seem very contrived and come to pass with no real explanation or reason. Many of the characters seem very cardboard cutoutish and not very original to me.It seemed a lot like the CSI episodes that use some horrific crime as an excuse not to write good character development/interaction. The hook is the crime and not the characters, seems lazy to me. But probably tuned in well to the general public, don't make them think about anything just make them react to something instead."
1,Avoid,"This was just bad.The attempt to reinvent Iron Man failed like no other Ultimate origin. From the beginning, the female characters didnt seem to know how to talk. the dialogue overall was poorly written, wooden and unrealistic. the way his dying mother predicts every effect of a genetic mutation is rediculous and is totally inconsistent throughout the story. The villains were ridiculous and so two dimensional as to be silly. I cant even begin to understand most of the scenes. Why did he bring the armor to school? why the boiler room?the blue armor makes no sense and decides not to explain itself. Rhodey seems at times genius and at others a simpleton. Just put the helmet on!!i only give it one star for the decent artwork. otherwise, i, a fan of Card's work for years, am disappointed. AVOID"
3,An Incomplete Story,"This collection stops abruptly with issue #5 of the Ultimate Iron Man limited series, and is picked up again in Card's Ultimate Iron Man II. Therefore, I'll reserve judgment on some of the stranger elements (Tony Stark as infected by a limb-regenerating virus and spray-painted in a blue bio-armor) until the full story is told.But judging this collection by itself, Card has really nailed Tony Stark's personality and built up a deep supporting cast for Ultimate Iron Man. It's not the regular Marvel Universe Iron Man, or the upcoming movie version of Iron Man. Whether or not this story works, though, won't be known until Ultimate Iron Man II is published."
4,Probably not what you expect,"The problem with this book is that it really isn't what people were expecting when they buy a book called ""Ultimate Iron Man"". The problem is this: this story starts from the very beginning, before Tony Stark was even born, and the full Iron Man armour doesn't show up until the last seven pages or so.This is definitely an origin tale, and it's well told and well written, intelligent and literate, and as always, Andy Kubert delivers his usual fine caliber of art. It's an auspicious beginning, but then it ends. The book should have been twice as long. This shouldn't have been a six issue miniseries, but a 12 issue miniseries. I would say, that if this were a completely new science fiction series, it would be great, but since I bought the book because I wanted to see Iron Man, I was disappointed. Nevertheless, for both the story and the art get solid A's. If nothing else, I finished the book wishing there were more, so that says something, I guess."
5,Wow -- Sloan is an extraordinary story teller,"I was unable to put this book down until I finished it. It kept me up most of the night. I have not read a better contemporary appalachian novel. You've probably met Sloan's characters before, but they are certainly not stereotypes. They are well developed characters, the REAL people of Eastern Kentucky, caught up in true-to-life situations. You will care about them. Sloan's collection of short stories ""Bearskin to Holly Fork"" is a good read, but ""Home Call"" held my attention more."
4,Garfield is far better than some hairy pickle!,"I think Garfield is one of the greatest strips of the modern era, and this book almost lives up to it. My only problem with the Garfield treasuries is the absence of the logo panels. Keep up the good work, Davis; and go back to whence you came, Bodega! Get back to your pickles!!"
1,garfield is such a big hairy pickle,"i did not like this book. eigth garfield treasure? hell, they should have stopped with number one. lets face it jim davis obviously cannot draw real tuff so he draws big fat dumb cats, stupid weenie dogs, and a big dumb idiot jon who probably eats too many hairy pickles. if i were a parent and concerned about what my child reads then i would definitely not recommend this book to anyone. It is horrible, difficult to read and the pictures just down right stink. oh yeah that nermal character is so stupid also, who ever heard of a cute cat, all cats are ugly hairy and smelly just like pickles. if you want a good book with lots of stupid animals and stupid hairy pickles then you will love this absolutely horrible book"
2,great old songs but brutal production value,"these songs are so good but sound quality of this live offering leaves much to be desired. hopefully spedding's studio albums like ""hurt"" and ""i'm not like everybody else"" will soon become available on cd. in the meantime, i will still abuse my ears with this poor substitute."
3,okay book,"I had heard good things about the book, but was a little disappointed with it...our daughter, being adopted, I thought would really enjoy this book, but it wasn't well used by her. It fell flat."
4,one of the better review books,I've used several SHSAT books to tutor students with. this review book is certainly not the best review book out there but it is one of the better. The important math concept is summarized in the back and probably the most useful part of the book. Definitely worth purchasing and reviewing if you don't plan on attending the expensive Kaplan courses.
4,chastised...,"Bought it for a friend and he JUST LOVED IT!!! He is a big fan and couldn't find it anywhere. I found it on the web and it was very easy to order. Highly recommended for those who love the militant, radical feel of the late 60's."
4,Dark Angel,I liked it as a good adventure story with an unexpected ending. Part historical . I will read more from this author.
2,Dark Angel,A very disappointing read. It was the first Jeffery Archer I had read and almost did not read anymore of his books. Burma legacy helped reinstate him as an author.
5,Best thing I've ever found,"I recently had a sinus infection and bronchitis. After having a bad reaction to the antibiotics my doctor prescribed me I looked up natural cures. I inhaled steam from a pot of water with a few drops of this eucalyptus oil in it 2 to 3 times a day for about 10 mins. It literally starting working instantly. It was the only thing that got me to stop coughing after a week of trying tons of different cough medicines. After only 3 days of doing this I was 100% better. You can also put a drop or two on your pillow to help with coughing fits at night. After seeing how well it worked for me I did more research on it and found that eucalyptus oil is antibacterial, antifungal, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti inflammatory and a decongestant."
1,Not real eucalyptus,"I would not recomment this product because it is not real eucalyptus oil....or maybe I just got a bad batch. It smelled horrible, nothing like eucalyptus is supposed to smell. I will continue to purchase the Aura Cacia brand because I never had problems with them."
3,Tall Wooden Coat Rack,"The item was received within a week of ordering it. However, it's now in use over 6 months and the item has become wobbly and we are not sure how to tighten it. It spins on an axle which is a good idea if it were made better"
4,"Nice, but a little expensive","I ordered this unit because it had a Luxeon LED, so I assumed that it would be fairly bright. But then, after I ordered it, I read in the product description that it was rated at only 42 lumens. So, I expected the worst before it arrived. But I was pleasantly surprised by the light output and uniformity of the light. It's no 'searchlight', but it's more than adequate for brightly illuminating an area. But I think that the price is a little high, and if you wanted greater light output, Amazon has better choices for the money."
4,Good light,This is a very good little light. Not too big to carry around in a toolkit while being bright enough for most uses. Works great on popular and economical rechargeable batteries. Battery life seems to be very good. Narro beam is better for illuminating more distant objects than many other lights in this class. Still enough beam spill to make a good walking light. Not 5 stars because changing batteries is more awkward than it should be.
5,Always with me,"I recommend this light after using one for 2 years now. I work outdoors at night, so I have several lights with me all of the time. This is one that is always either in my vest pocket, back pocket, or in my hand. When the headlamp is not enough, or I need a spot with a long throw, this is my second brightest light -- I keep a rechargeable 'Cyclops' 3 watt LED spotlight on the seat of the rig as well, but because of its size, I have keep this Streamlight on me when I'm out and about at night. The battery life is as advertised, at least with intermittent use. Good ergonomics, comfortable to carry and I like the switch on the butt end. It must be waterproof, after 2 years of abuse it still works like new."
2,Sort of Disappointing,"I found this book a bit disappointing. I have high expectations of O'reilly books and have found them a treasure trove of valuable information. I was expecting the same in-depthness from this book. Unfortunately it seemed to me much more of a survey of the OS rather than delving into the nitty gritty of the subject matter.If you are new to Solaris it may be a great book, but it seems to me an experienced Solaris admin will be disappointed by this book."
1,One of weaker O'Reilly's books,I wonder who the targeted reader of this book is:Beginner will not find nearly enough technical information to learnany of the tipics mentioned and book by no means can be used asa shelf reference for more advanced user.Cannot recommend it to anybody.
1,"Uninformative, superficial, harmful!","This must be the worst O'Reilly book I have ever read and I have read atleast 20!The author reproduces much of the information from his other books ""Solaris Complete Reference"" which has much the same inforamtion as his ""Solaris Administration -A Beginner's Guide"".His coverage of important topics like E-mail consists of showing how to download sendmail through anonymous ftp.His discussion on the inetd super daemon consists of a three page listing of /etc/services file and so on.Incredible, really!I remember O'Reilly once withdrew a title on Beowulf Clusters stating that the quality was not upto reader expectations!I submit this as a definite candidate."
2,Overview without deep information,I'm quite disappointed from this O'Reilly book. I expected technical information for a professional system administrator but got a fast overview. The author tries to cover everything form networking to Java in just 300 pages.
1,Administrator's Guide - NOT!,"Solaris 8 General Networking Overview would be a better title. The book does not even mention disk formatting (except fdisk for Intel boxes), logical volumes of any type, nothing about patching or the care and feeding of Solaris. If you're looking for a good Sun/Solaris Admin Guide - pass on this one...."
2,Not a good beginner book,"Have to agree with version7x - the book's more about network admin for Solaris 8 than it is about Solaris 8 itself. Don't be fooled by the title or the editorial review. If you are as new to Solaris 8 as I am, buy Solaris Operating Environment Boot Camp (ISBN: 0130342874) instead. Two stars for a misleading title!"
2,Disappointing for an ORA book,"I purchased this book online, and was very disappointed in the depth into which this book delves into Solaris. I bought the book b/c of the ORA name, which normally works out VERY well for me, but this time was definitely an exception. This is an OK book for general SA knowledge, but there are definitely other books that are better for general SA knowledge (such as UNIX System Administration Handbook)."
1,Waste of money,"If you know _anything_ about Solaris, this book is useless for you.I understand an administration book should talk about /etc/services. What is not so understandable is to have a _whole_ services file displayed in more than two pages of the book. What for? What is the purpose? I can ""cat"" it if I need to see it complete. That happens with many files, and many pages. Of the 400 pages of this book, 200 are wasted paper, and the other only cover very basic stuff. Look elsewhere for a Solaris admin book."
2,LOOK carefully at this book before you buy it!,"It covers lots of obscure network ideas, and omits lots of practical topics. I'd suggest you look it over VERY closely before you buy it. This is one of the few ORA books I will not buy."
5,Great Series,"The entire series, headed by this volume, is fantastic. I was introduced to M. Molo in 1969, and went on to buy al of his books in hardbound.While I no longer play, it is a tribute to his skill at captivating the quirks of the table, the game and his colorful collection of players that I have not sold the set even in light of the rather high price it now commands.Just great bridge writing, timeless too."
2,I can't be used by a very senior bridge player.,"I bought the book to give to my mother who is an avid bridge player. I thought it would challenge her mind in a pleasantway. Unfortunately, I think this might have been good in her forties, but she does not have the patience to read andcontemplate while in her nineties. She is an excellent reader, but I think the book was too difficult."
3,Explores a Lost Event in Christian Hisotry,"While Sam Sheldon may have set out to write the book he always wanted to read he also wrote the book many others have been longing to read as well. Some may find it controversial that Sheldon attempts to recreate the Hell that Jesus went through, but it is a topic that has not been as explored as many would have like to have seen. I couldn't put this book down. I applaud Sam Sheldon for his effort and his great novel that is extremely underrated."
3,British pulp fiction.,"This short, fast paced paperback starts off with its protagonist American Matt Brady being framed for the brutal murder of a London call girl. He's sentenced to life imprisonment but manages to bust out of his maximum security prison without much difficulty. Following that he has a series of encounters with a number of sleazy denizens of England's criminal netherworld....culminating in a confrontation between Brady and the true murderer.This book is action-packed but completely lacking in any semblance of realism. Escapist fare pure and simple."
4,A Good Higgins Thriller,Keep some time open when you start this book because you will want to stay and finish it. It is good.
1,Poor quality - made in Malaysia,"These are similar to my Spode Christmas Tree dishes made in England - but very poor quality. There are bubbles in the finish and very definite spots on the back of the dishes where the glaze did not cover the clay. Very very disappointing. If you are looking for a cute set to serve at Christmas, these might be fine, but if you are expecting real English Spode, then do not order these."
1,This dinnerware is NOT made in England.,"When I received this set from Amazon, I was extremely disappointed to find that it is made in Malaysia, NOT England. I looked at numerous pieces in the Spode Christmas Tree line at Macy's, and discovered that almost all of them are made in Malaysia or China. I believe that Amazon has incorrectly listed the country of origin as England for a number of these pieces.At Macy's I compared the coloring of plates made in England with pieces from Malaysia and China. There are subtle differences, particularly in the color red."
2,Not mama's heirlooms,"It is a shame when a respected English china company sells out local workers & moves production to Asia.The 'new' china and flatware is ok for Xmas novelties, but the heirlooms passed down from mom to the kids is a thing of the past.The sad part is (like another reviewer mentioned) the list prices for this Asian junk are pretty steep.I suggest taking your chances buying the old English-made stuff on ebay & hoping it arrives as advertised. If successful you'll have 'the good stuff' instead of mass-produced, inferior quality nic-nacs."
2,Lookin for the English version- i know where to go!,"THis is J-U-N-K. SO SAD! HOWEVER---For those of you looking for the original Spode etc. try going to look at Replacements.com. They carry old Estate sales, old dept store leftovers and private stocks as well, which VERY often may be the English china we are looking for! They even have a place you can write in and ask them to see if they can find what you are looking for! I spent two hours on that site just a minute ago and found 2 old patterns that had been discontinued for myself and was able to FINALLY get the pieces i was so sad about losing!! They are VERY NICE PEOPLE to deal with too! EXCELLENT! 5 stars! Give it a try! I wasnt looking for the Spode but I found stuff i havent seen ANYWHERE else in YEARS!"
3,Starter Spod dinnerware set,"Spode Christmas Tree 12-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4The purchase was to add to my other Christmas starter sets, arriving promptly but regrettably not well packed so a salad plate was broken in transit. Still the Christmas table will look great in 2012!"
5,The Finishing Touch,"These wonderful Spode Christmas plates were the finishing touch to my Christmas table. At first I was hesitant to buy them because the price was so much less than I had paid for the other dishes in my collection. Thank goodness I ordered them! This dinnerware is the real thing, at a fraction of the price!"
3,Good and Bad,"The bag seemed great at first...but after using it for a couple weeks, it just didn't work for my child and I. I felt like I had to squeeze everything into it. Just felt like there wasn't enough room for what we needed. I love that it is a sling backpack and easy to carry. Sometimes my daughters bottles leak and the compartments are not water proof, so everything in the bag would get wet and stained the bag. When I washed the removeable bottle compartment, it fell apart. We no longer use the diaper bag. It wasn't the right size for us, but might be for others."
5,very good,"I have very oily skin, but it still cracks with the cold. These cream is perfect for me because it's light but hydrates just fine."
1,Mystic Empire,This book is not worth the time or money.Tracy should stick to writing with Weis.I read over 100 books a year and by far this is the worst I've read.
1,Garbage,"I'm sick and tired of somebody like this PHd relating everything in African American culture to hip hop. I don't like anything he says about Michael Jordan you know why because he was not raised in the ghetto and he was not groomed to be a thug so he won't act like it. Bravo to him for that. My son is 21 and he is appauled at being related to this hip hop trash. It's sad when all you can do in your life is try to live out some rap lyrics. Write something intellectual please Mr. Phd. Just in case you didn't know, there are young african american people who read, invent, design, etc. Yes there are young African Americans who can actually READ!"
2,I'm not sure what to think of this book...,"First off I applaud Dr. Boyd's effort to write a book of this nature regarding the Hip-Hop generation which I am basically apart of since I grew up in the ""Reagan 80's"". I feel that Dr. Boyd falls short of clearly depicting his parallelism between Hip-Hop and the NBA. There are many points that he does not clearly explain, or just doesn't address at all. The book also lacks depth and concrete research to support some of his information.I honestly believe that Dr. Boyd ""Free-styled"" his way through writing this book heavily relying on his past experiences and knowledge of both entities.If you are an avid fan of the NBA and Hip-Hop just as I am you will not walk away reading anything new from this book.A book such as Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur by Michael Dyson provides a better depiction the Hip-Hop generation."
4,Gave it to 'em raw,"Dr. Boyd hits it on the head with this piece about basketball and hip-hop. The only way a book like this can be written the way it was is if you are a part of the culture yourself, because if not, it will not be easy to understand. I, for one, love it because he uses teams from the 80's, such as the Georgetown Hoyas, the early 90's with the Fab Five of the Michigan Wolverines, and other teams, players, and events in the game which took me back in time. When he speaks about these things, you can see the connection with hip-hop, such as Allen Iverson's influence, and others lack thereof. He uses lyrics from some of the hip-hop's greats, but like I mentioned before, you must be a part of the culture or at least familiar with it to see what he is trying to say. He keeps it real throughout the book and gives credit where it is due while being critical at the same time. 'Ball and hip-hop have a unique bond, and the significance of it cannot be ignored."
4,"young, black, rich, famous: the rise of the nba, the hip hop invasion, and the transformation of american culture","The book was very informing concerning the hip hop culture. A good ""snap shot"" of young males dreams and aspirations."
4,Hog Heaven,"Hog Heaven is one of the many documenteries about H-D, however I liked to see the old black/white films in it! Knowing the H-D history all to well, the second part of the DVD was of more interest to me! However, it's a must for the real HOG fan!"

4,Still A Good Book,"After having read both editions of Quaal's book, I did notice that the captioning of some of the figures in the second edition are incorrect. This was probably just a minor oversight in updating from the first edition. Overall, my previous review is still the same."
1,I didn't get what is illustrated,"The illustration showed a filter like the one in my humidifier. The mesh holding the foam filter cylinder is stretchable and will easily conform to the frame which holds it. The items shipped had a different mesh from the one depicted, would not stretch, and cannot be installed properly."
2,KEEP LOOKING,"LITERALLY FELL APART ON THE VERY FIRST USE. THE MOUNT IS ONE SIDED SO ANY TRAIL CREATES A VIBRATION IN THE MOUNT. THE LIGHT'S HOUSING RING VIBED OFF AND THE REFLECTOR,LENS, BULB AND ALL ENDED UP ON THE RACK. I DONT EVEN RIDE THAT HARD.THE SWITCH MECHANISM IS THE REAL LAUGHER. I'LL BE SENDING THIS ONE BACK. SPEND THE EXTRA CASH AND GET A GOOD ONE. OH YEAH, ITS REAL BRIGHT SO I'LL GIVE IT TWO STARS."
2,12V plug is too light weight,"Works as described but prolong use as in spotlighting for varmints, creates some big time heat on the 12V plug. Both of these, we had one on each side of the Jeep, melted at the plug. they still work with some messing around at the plug and some re-soldering. But the plug NEEDs to be heavier duty than what it is. I'd say if you don't need the mounting capabilities of this light, look else where."
5,Blow ye winds in the morning,This was my first introduction to Revels. It's high quality and great selection of songs had me listening to it over and over.You will enjoy the tremendous talent that went into making this CD.
4,Let him know we want another album !!!,"I have been able to also collect all five albums. Roby really takes off in jazz flavored tunes that are very heartfelt toward God. I remember as a new christian hearing this album, I was struck, it really shines of a heart in love with God, with a Jazz-Soul type stylings. I especially liked Oh magnify the lord, Rested in your love, and Seasons of change. Each successive album is better then the last. I was able to get Roby's email address from the unofficial Roby Duke website, it is Robyduke@MSN.NET. Let him know we want another album and how much we appreciate his music!"
5,Great Music that should still be sold today,"I had to look hard to find a copy of this CD. Luckily I found a used copy for about $35. I really believe this CD should still be available for sale, even if only through Amazon MP3 or iTunes. The songs on this album are classic and timeless! They are one of a kind and unforgettable!"
4,"Cheesy album cover,great CCM!","I noticed they changed the album cover for the CD release-like so many other CCM(or not so CCM,if you get my drift)jacket covers from the 70's & 80's,where gleaming chompers,bad sweaters,mullets and elbow-patched tweed jackets were the norm,""Not The Same""'s cover features a smiling Roby Duke,his beard,and a plant.If there was ever a clearer case of zero-hype/quality smooth CCM Westcoast,this here's it.Uplifting MOR/Smooth Westcoast stuff with a great message.(beautiful,mellifluous vocal,btw)Check it out!!"
3,Looks better in the picture!,I'm disappointed in the hat being too small. It barely comes down on the sides of my head and I don't have a large head. I love the design but it's just too small.
4,Help if you're really serious,"This book will help you to explore your inner self and your reasons for overeating. It is not light, fun reading. It is a serious book and it demands that you be serious and honest with yourself in order to successfully learn how to abstain from overeating. The steps are simple to understand. Being honest with yourself about your eating habits is not at all simple. A very helpful book when you're ready for that challenge."
2,Would Not Recommend,"Overeater's Journal: Exercises for Heart, Mind and Soul does not offer a lot. It is basically blank journal with topics to be filled in. I did not find it useful."
2,"Articles Yes, Book No",Sorry I like Jack's articles and newsletters but his writing style for some reason gets on my nerves. I couldn't finish this book because of that. Sometimes he just rambles on. I first read one of his articles online and it drew me to the power exchange relationship because it was like he wrote it about me but after that he just seemed to write at times just to see what he said in print.
2,Well - its okay - but ...,"I have only used the unit one time and it seemed to work ok - but getting it set up is another chore. There was no damage to the box or the packing material - not even a crease. However the retractable handle is bent on the indised. The handle unit is not damaged at all on the outside, not even a broken part in the pant, but the handle that rectacts inside the handle frame is creased and bent so that retracting the handle is almost impossible. If you yank or pull on it hard enough your get the one side to rectract a bit but it is never level or locked into place on the left side so that you can pull or push the unit free and easy. I contacted the seller to relace just the handle assembly and I could replace it easy - i am still waiting on a reply. So inspect carefully and completely. I did but I still missed this issue till I really needed to use it. If not for this I would give 3 or probably 4 stars."
1,Worthless,I am a college band director and deal with PA's for a living. I can yell louder than this thing can go. Completely worthless. Don't waste your money or your time.
5,Awesome DVD; Warning: This is a Motion Comic; not an animation DVD,"Despite the negative reviews from the 2 people who failed to do research to what a motion comic is, this is a good dvd for any Marvel fan & any big fan of Iron Man, they animation was done quite well & I'm looking forward to future Marvel motion comic dvd releases"
3,Motion Comic?,"Not a big fan of this style of animation. I actually bought this movie at a store and not from Amazon. There is nothing on the packaging that identifies it is a ""motion comic"". I probably would have bought it anyway, just to see what it was like, but after seeing it, not a fan.The story itself was very dark. Definitely not kid friendly."
3,"Decent, but I've seen better","I was huge fan of the Extremis comic, so when I heard they were making a motion comic of it, I was intrigued. Sadly, I was a little disappointed in what I saw. I absolutely loved the art style that was used, it's some of the most realistic stuff I've seen for this particular medium. The story was pretty good, though I don't think Extremis lends itself to the format very well as there's a lot of ""heavy"" dialogue throughout, so I think it's definitely better when read as a standard comic. About the only thing that really put a damper on this was the acting. The performances are stiff and lifeless. You can almost feel the actors reading from cue cards, which kind of hurts the whole story because there's little to no emotion put into what's being said.So all in all, a decent watch, but nothing special. If you want to fully enjoy the Extremis story, I'd stick to the comic."
1,bad stuff,really primitive animation... worthless and 30 years out of date.../ 'clutch cargo' from late 50's comes to mind.. CRAP!!! No good and way too hard to pan on this 3rd attempt!!
1,It is a Motion Comic - Not worth the money,"If you are expecting a comic book with little motion, then this is what you will get. It is no better than watching a picture moving back and forth. It is not a cartoon, it is not a movie. Very disappointing."
1,"if i wanted to watch a comic rolling, i would have been flipping the pages.","i don't understand how someone could enjoy watching an animated movie that basically is the same as sitting there and flipping the pages to see the characters moving in slow motion. the graphics is terrible because the images of the characters is disproportionate and rough making them seem as though they were drawn by amateurs. i wasted my money buying this and will avoid any of the same type of animated movies by the same ""artists"". to summarize this up in the most direct way...my kids who love and are always glued to watching animated movies fell ASLEEP after 5 minutes from the start of the 1st episode."
2,Pass on this one,"story line, not great. artwork, AWFUL. anyone who says the artwork is great is also a fan of the current crap in comics now. I stopped reading them because the art work is horrible now. I generally look forward to things being released but I see now I have to review EVERY item before purchasing. I expected art to be like every other movie (avengers, dr. strange) but this was a waste. not to give the story away but there was twist at the end. it still doesn't make up for the fact I rolled my eyes the same way as star trek 5 and said (outloud in the theater) oh kill me now. hopefully marvel will not make a habit of this but I'm not holding my breath. black panther was the same type of art. I can see my days of watching the comic books on dvd is coming to an end"
2,Good for church choirs or adult groups,"I bought this video hoping to use it with my junior high group for when a substitute comes who is not a musician. Some of the songs were great, but there were too many unfamiliar carols for this age group and two of the familiar carols were done to the less familiar tunes. The students became bored. The words were easy to read and the performance was beautiful, however."
5,must have,"a must-have for inuyasha fans. wonderful character pics. you gotta love the characters, especially the lead character inuyahsa!!!! i absolutely love this show!!!! beckett anime is a very great magazine for info on this show (not to mention cool pics from the show, and other cool anime shows)!!"
1,Did'nt work for me.,"I needed a new battery for my Motorola I2000 phone so I ordered this and it did not work for me...I received an ""incompatible battery"" error message. It would not charge or operate the phone. This is not a genuine Motorola battery. Reluctantly, I had to return it and I'm not sure if I can get this battery again. I think I own a dinnosaur."
5,Vash the Stampede - keychain,"I got this for my husband for his birthday, he immediately fell in love!"
4,Interesting facts but some inappropriate content for childre,"This book was a great resource - I had to do an Exploring Arts project on Picasso for both a 3rd grade class and a 1st grade class. I was able to read this book to the 3rd grade class with omitting 4 - 5 pages, but it was definitely not appropriate for 1st graders. During the blue period section, it says that Picasso was depressed because his best friend committed suicide and that Picasso had used (and I quote) ""tramps and drunks"" as his subjects! It also has a few too many visuals that are better left to older eyes. That being said, it did have some great facts that I hadn't seen anywhere else and the Children REALLY liked this book."
5,Good Luck and Fashion for All is Timeless,I was so pleased with this and wish I had more than one forme and to give to daughter as a special gift.
3,Go Hoyas!,Nice quality Jersey. Didnt Like the placement or size of the Bulldogs face. Thought is was set a little low and will be covered partly under the pants waist.
5,ADORABLE,MY GREAT GRANDAUGHTER LOVED THIS.IT IS VERY WELL MADE AND EASY FOR LITTLE HANDS TO USE. I AM VERY HAPPY.
3,Must buy the tab inserts separately,"These folders, manufactured by the Smead Manufacturing Company, are fine, but they do not come with the tab inserts for labeling the folders, and thus I am not fully satisfied."
5,wireless lans demystified,"If one wishes to go wireless, here is the book that will take you there.Superbly written in great detail and simplicity even a novice will be able to understand.Those of you doing Cisco Network Engineering- CCENT- course, buy this book. Good coverage and good suplemental reading."
3,In the style of,The past reviews I believe are too critical... In the style of means that the licks in the book are similar but not necessarily riffs taken from grant green. The book is meant to learn more in the style of Grant Green and be able to practice the riffs/ideas in different keys hence the cd (Which I didn't find useless as I used the cd) If you listen to Grant Green you do find that he uses the blues scale frequently and the slide pull off technique described in the book is used in almost every Green song and a ton of his licks.Also people not happy with this book should read the descriptions of the book first as Corey Christiansen has done a number of books in this series. Its not to get you to sound like Grant Green (transcribe all his songs if this is what you want) its to incorporate some of the important elements of the greats into your style. You need to develop your own ideas for this series of books to help. (I know shocking!)
2,Too litlle Grant Green,"Allthough the cover looks nice, the contents of this book are, to say the least, very ""meager"" and does not really give in insight into the beautiful playing of the late Grant Green. The accompanying CD is a waste of money and effort."
1,One Of The Great Hacks Of All Time...,"This lamentable tome is the work of a frustrated wannabe. Handler's asperations to be the next Elmore Leonard fail from his utter lack of talent, as well as the derivative nature of every paragraph that's culled from so many other works.. the man should include a bibliography. Yawn. A truly crummy ripoff. I only give it one star because it least there were no spelling errors."
3,Good Read,A good mystery. Did not know the murderer(s) until the end. At times too much description of the area/characters and not enough dialogue - especially with the main characters. Still a good read though and I will read the next in the series.
5,Great!,"I've been doing a lot of searching online about acting. I found some but I decided to get a book which I hoped would be more trutful and more exact. Well, it was! It gave information about a LOT of stuff. It seemed to be more about theater then movie acting but it was still a great book! Recommended reading: 12-20"
5,A must read for students,Any one who is contemplating acting professionally should read this book. It tells you in an honest way what you are getting into and how you would be living.
3,Ads in the episodes,"Four or five stars for the content, two stars off for the ads that appear just after the intro for each episode. One of the things I like about their magazine is that there are no ads in it, so it's disappointing to see ads here."
4,A Great Read!,"This is a wonderful novel, certainly original, going off in unexpected directions - a gay novel unlike other gay novels - with people that we haven't really met before. This is Brassell's first novel and he is a fresh voice, tackling the subject of friendships between gay and straight men. And he does it in a unique way - on top of which, he does not sugarcoat anything or make things easy for the characters. I liked the fact that it was different. I liked the characters. And the resolution is honest. Give the book and Brassell a chance. I think he deserves it...and I look forward to hearing what else he has to say."
5,Excellent book for quilters interested in hawaiin blocks,"Patterns are given full size and include a brief description. Instructions on how to applique and quilt are simple and clear. A ""must"" for every quilter interested in Hawaiian quilts"
5,stunning,"I have been making a queen size quilt using these patterns for nearly a year now. I find them easy and very effective, I am using a cream background and red flowers. I could not have attempted these designs without the book. Thank you."
4,Great Book for Quilters,I purchased this book for a dear friend who is a quilter. She has wanted to make a Hawaiian quilt. She loves the book because of the variety and number of blocks. It was a very nice birthday gift and I would give it again to any of my quilter friends who are interested in Hawaiian quilting.
5,Hawaiian Quilt guide,This book gives quilt patterns and detailed instructions on quilt making. Just what I was looking for! The quilt patterns are some of the more familiar and traditional. One could also make their own patterns.
5,Easy Hawaiian Quilting,This book was exactly what I wanted. The variety of full size patterns are perfect. I would recommend this book for anyone that wants to try making a traditional Hawaiian Quilt. The instructions are very easy to follow.
1,the worst stroller on the market,"We bought this stroller because it looked very trendy and peg perego was a good brand to begin with; however, the stroller sucked! The front wheels jammed all the time. I got stuck in the middle of the street because the wheels just wouldn't go forward. When we reversed the handle where the big wheels were on the front, it still felt funny when pushing it. Not a good product at all, such a waste of money. We are contacting the company for refund and such."
1,Difficult turning,"I don't understand why, but i really regret buying the stroller, because i just cant seem to turn the stroller. The front wheels turn individually jamming the motion, and not allowing the stroller to move foreword in a straight line after a turn.I am contacting the manufacturer for my money back."
1,Awful,"This movie is awful. The acting is not good, the story is odd, and the special effects are awful. It should only be 1 hour long, not 90 minutes. Do not buy this movie, it is awful."
1,Very slow movie.,The production and actors' performances is very bad. This is probably a movie for little (very little) children.The children actors were cute but it was boring to watch.
1,Sophomoric writing make this unreadable,"Flat characters and pedestrian prose make this a real sleeper. While there may be action, action, action, the characters are juvenile and appear to be going nowhere. This book popped up when I entered my tastes - which go toward literature! This is not literature."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A story about a team of storm chases, and their dictatorial, totallyobsessed leader, and their struggles to survive and make a living.Also of interest is that in this society commercial banks areextinct dinosaurs, as a system for person to person encrypted,government and corporate proof financial transactions has beeninvented, totally cutting out the middle man and law enforcement ingeneral from tracing money."
5,A Splendid Meteorological Cyberpunk Novel,"""Heavy Weather"" is one of Bruce Sterling's finest novels. Of his recent efforts, I found it almost as satisfying and mesmerizing a tale as his critically acclaimed ""Holy Fire"". In both books he creates very appealing, well-rounded characters whose believable actions quickly move their plots along. Both Alex and Janey Unger are two of his most memorable characters; the plot unfolds through their eyes. Admittedly, Sterling's meteorology seems a bit far fetched, yet it is grounded well in science; it may be an accurate prediction of a future adversely affected by the ""greenhouse effect"". Sterling's dense prose is quite vivid, and among his most lyrical to date. Naturally comparisons to William Gibson's early work can be made, but that should not detract from Sterling's thoughtful, inspired view of a potential American future. It certainly should be regarded as among the finest works of cyberpunk fiction, written by one of its foremost proponents."
1,Heavy Weather,"I picked up Heavy Weather after reading that Bruce Sterling's work was comparable to William Gibson. I couldn't have been more wrong! Boring and cheesy are the two best words to describe Heavy Weather. I don't think anyone will be saying ""mega tasty"" anytime in the future, especially since that came and went in the 80s. The plot moves so slowly it's almost painful, the characters are sad stereotypes and I don't think that using the word ""hack"" a million times qualifies this as cyberpunk sci-fi. Definitely avoid this book, and, if this is indicative of Bruce Sterling's work, avoid all of his books. My time would've been far better spent rereading Neuromancer."
1,Has Bruce Sterling actually TALKED to any computer geeks?,"Like others, I bought this book because of recommendations that put Bruce Sterling in the same category as authors like Neal Stephenson and William Gibson. I hope Amazon was paid handsomely to make that comparison, because it can't possibly be less true. The characters are two-dimensional and predictable. The women, typical of most of the sci-fi I've seen, are cliched and ultimately dependent on their men, although Sterling seems to think that bitchy catfights = feminist empowerment. I've saved the worst for last, however: the dialog. Sterling's dialog in Heavy Weather is painful to read. ""Mega tasty?"" Who *says* that? He has achieved the literary equivalent of MovieOS--a non-geek attempting to approximate what ""real"" geeks do, what they enjoy, how they talk. It's fake and cloying and makes me, a geek, shout ""DUDE. Shut. Up."" at almost every page. Save your money and buy some real cyberpunk literature. This isn't it."
2,Well it started well,"But just at about the halfway poin the execution kind of dies, and as much as I like Sterling,the writeing style ends up comeing off as sort of a Gibson knock off"
3,"Interesting Ideas, But Not Much on Plot","In ""Heavy Weather"" Bruce Sterling attempts to construct a storyline around a bunch of very interesting ""futureshock"" concepts. Unfortunately the concept is better than the execution. The plot alternately plods and accelerates, and its two main characters are not the most likable in fiction, particularly that of Jane/Juanita. After only adequately building the suspense for almost 300 pages, the ending totally wimps out, with some of its key action ""off-stage"". Doesn't anyone know how to end a story any more? While this book offers some interesting parts, there is too much speculation and not enough fiction in this speculative fiction."
4,Cyberpunk in Texas!,"This is quite readable--a cyberpunk book that doesn't take place in a huge urban sprawl, and the data being stolen is from Mother Nature, who never gives up secrets easily. From a Mexican black market clinic to a tornado that could cover an entire time zone, several intrepid scientists and one dying part-time drug runner attempt to figure out why tornadoes form, and whether or not one can be stopped before it's too late. Of course, by the end of the book, it's almost too late. It's always nice to see actual science and actual characterization in a book, and kudos for including a ""lung enema"" at the beginning of the book. I'd say it's about a three and a half star book, but Amazon doesn't let you do that. So enjoy a free half-star, Mr. Sterling."
5,I'm a folk nut ....,"...who loves The Revels. In the UK especially they seem to be almost unknown yet they have been one of the great ""groups"" that has kept the wonderful traditional music of these Isles alive.I have many of their records and truly love all of them. This lovely Christmas record is just one of them that I'll always come back to at this time of year. This is real, human, sincere and wonderful music."
3,A great record live,"Very lively, this is the less that one can say about this title. The beautiful voice of Chico Cesar still pushes our souls to pleasure and satisfaction. A very nice first song : ""Mama Africa"""
3,Not all there.,"This DVD set is really a fantastic collection of some great work by the late and great Michael Jackson. The reason I rate this 3 stars is because, On the box it clearly says ""ALL 35 SHORT FILMS IN FULL"". Lie. ""Smooth Criminal"" Is the 10 minute version. Smooth Criminal in it's full version is more around 30,or 35 minutes. ""Ghost"" Was always my favorite short film! I think it was a wonderful amazing peice of work. However the DVD gives us a edited 4 minute version of the film. Originaly 35 minutes. Ghost was never released on DVD so when I read that this had Ghost in its full I WAS SOO EXCITED, I got home clicked play and it wasnt. Guys and gals, dont be fooled as I was. If you dont care about those 2 wonderful videos then this set is super fantastic. Just to let you no, dont buy it for Ghost like I did."
3,Not a complete collection,"Sony Legacy is trying to push this off as a complete collection, but it by no means is. This set features a 4 minute version of the short film Ghosts, the full version of which is 39 minutes. I have no idea why they have chosen to do this. Otherwise, this is a good collection, especially for the price. It's just a shame they abridged Ghosts."
3,This is not wide screen or even full screen,"The content of this set is great, but the videos are not even full CRT (old fashioned standard definition TV) size, they are presented in a box about 80% of the screen size with the outer screen border blacked out. The case says the content is formatted for Wide Screen, but I did not see any way to change the display ratio with my DVD player. So I am happy with the content and to be able to see it, but disappointed with the presentation size - I expected it to at least fill a standard screen :-("
2,Disappointed,"I see no need for a long, impressive review here. I have 2 BIG complaints about this collection. #1 The full version of Ghost is not in this collection. It is some poor montage of the full version. If you never saw the original it would make no sense. Also, just like the MJ dance game, they used the LP version, not the video remix. #2 I have other MJ DVD's and many have poor editing quality and menus that don't work. The same on this set. The biggest pain being this is one of those DVD's that do not let you fast forward or rewind. You are forced to watch the video through completely. No skipping stuff you don't want to see, or rewinding your favorite part. I just wanted all MJ's videos, full and unedited, menus that work, good quality, and use of the simple RW and FF funtion. Seems simple enough. I also want the Victory Tour released."
5,you love it,Just reading the contents of this title you know what you're getting and you know you'll love it.Cannot wait to see the previously unreleased short films!
4,Great set just lacking a few things,"I got this in the mail today and loved it. Maybe the best MJ release on DVD yet. That said, I'm giving it only four stars and not five because despite being billed as a complete set, I was very sad to see that the full version of ""Ghosts"" was not on it, nor was ""We Are the World."" Both should be on here. In fact, I'd even go so far to say that ""Captain Eo"" should be on here as well. But, in the case of that short, I realize it comes down to Disney more then Sony and based on Disney's track record with their theme park shows being released on VHS or DVD, I'm not holding my breathe.If I could could give it four and a half stars, I would though, as past those few things, it is a really great collection that I'd recommend to anyone."
5,Love It!!!!,We love Michael Jackson and we LOVE this DVD! My kids are only 3 and 6 but they love his music and the videos. I tried to tape his videos of TV but they never play nearly all of them. I have not noticed any missing.
2,"MICHEAL JACKSON""S VISION","VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THE WAY IT WAS PACKAGED ! THEY DID A POOR JOB OF CLEANING THESE VIDEOS !!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT""S WHAT HAS ME ANGRY !!!!!!!!!"
2,Terrible Video Quality!,"These DVD's are very poorly authored. It appears that the transfers didn't come from the original films but rather previous dvds/vhs tapes. Very grainy often pixelated reproductions, especially if you are watching in high definition. Don't waste your money. Wait and see if they put together a more comprehensive compilation with better video quality. Honestly, I wouldn't even classify these as ""DVD quality"" and you can forget about any semblance of definition. In fact, you may feel like going to the eye doctor after watching this."
4,Finally have most of his videos all in one place!,"I got this 2 days ago, and love it. I won't go on and on about his musical genius and visionary status, as we all very much know this. It's cool to see he's got more videos than I realized, even after I thought I saw every one on You Tube.I only give it 4 stars because it is incomplete - it does NOT contain all of his music videos. The two that are missing are ""Captain EO"" (my favorite of his videos, even above Thriller), and the ""We are the World"" video. I assume that has something to do with who's got the rights to those - Captain EO is Disney's domain, and We are the Worlds - not sure but it wasn't Michael Jackson alone who made it.The other reason I give it 4 stars is that it does not have subtitles. Wouldn't that be cool, to be able to see the lyrics via subtitles? I love Michael, but sometimes his lyrics are hard to understand!Anyway, I'm loving this regardless!"
1,disappointed!,"I have all the Michael Jackson DVDs at home. I've always been disappointed with the sound and picture quality. I am sad to see that this box set is on DVD and not remastered for bluray. I am also disappointed that it is in 2 channel stereo and not even DTS 5.1. I am definitely giving this one a skip. Been disappointed too many times and behind the pretty wrapping, I can see that this is exactly the same as the previous bad releases. Please remaster this material! I would rather download the youtube videos. it'll probably be around the same quality. So disappointed because this would've made the perfect gift on bluray :("
1,"""Gone Too Soon"" documentary is better than this!","Music videos we have all seen already; The one dvd has ""Hold My Hand."" In my opinion, Sony has disrespected MJ's memory, BIG TIME! That music video doesn't have anything new with MJ, just clips from old concerts. If you want to see anything new with MJ, forget this one. MJ didn't do any music videos for several years. This mess will prove that. Keep your money! You'll get more entertainment from the ""Gone Too Soon,"" documentary on dvd right now. It's a Region 4 dvd. You can't play it on dvd players in the U.S., but you can play it on your computer. Purchased from a dvd store in Austrailia."
4,Love it! cause I am a huge MJ fan!,"ALMOST all Michael's music videos are in here. Full version of Ghost video isn't available. Well if your a MJ fan and wanna own your own copy of MJ's videos, this is a good compilation. (finally I have a clear copy of ""they don't really care about us - prison version"")"
4,How Dare You Replace a Perfect Original with an Utter Garbage --- Blood On The Dance Floor Refugee Camp Remix,"Whose incompetent idea was it to REPLACE the original Michael Jackson version with this horrible remix by the Refugee Camp on the official video collection entitled Michael Jackson's Vision? THIS torturous audio garbage is not Michael's vision, not his approved version and promoting Refugee Camp's inferior version over Michael's masterpiece is an absolute outrage and ruining his legacy. I am totally appalled. Making a remix is one thing ... unilaterally pushing it on a DVD collection which should be only original material by an artist is disgusting. Whoever did this has no sense of quality or respect for Michael's legacy. :-?"
5,Michael Jackson's Vision,"This 3-disc set shows every Michael Jackson video he ever made, minus ""Captain Eo"" from Disney World. My only regret is that the video for ""Smooth Criminal"" was not the full-length video from ""Moonwalker"" which included the interaction with Joe Pesci's character. Aside from that, this video set is great for any Michael Jackson fan!"
2,Great legacy tarnished by terrible remaster,"First things first, we all know Michael Jackson is a great musician and artist. There's no denying that.However this compilation is a disgrace. Yes the sound is great (at 24-bit Linear PCM I would sure hope so), but the quality of the VIDEO is atrocious! And with this being a compilation of MJ's music VIDEOS one would expect pristine quality from one of the world's greatest entertainers.The fact that the quality of some of these music videos has been better on DVDs released 3-4 years prior (not to mention the option of 5.1 Surround Sound) is depressing. Not only that, but some of the videos are incomplete!So all in all, I wouldn't advise anyone to waste their money on something that is obviously a quick cash-in, especially when there are far better options available (Number Ones, HIStory on Film I & II, Dangerous - The Short Films to name a few).Wait for a Blu-Ray release or get the other titles mentioned. Until then, avoid this thing at all costs."
2,Disappointed,"""Be Warned"" Yes this is a clever idea at first glance. Unfortunately the product does not work efficiently and the company does not back up their product return. Due to the large quantity of food coming out at one time the company advised that we take the dispenser apart and move the dial to a desired setting (why isn't this in the instructions? wait...there are no instructions). They said we could return the dispenser if we still had problems but would first need to call. We tried their suggestion and unfortunately same result. We made numerous calls about a return and were told each time that they had to check with the supervisor and would get back to us. Still waiting. . . Anyway, will be passing it along to someone else who allows their pet to eat large amounts of food all day. By the way, any cat who eats all day will have major gastrointestinal problems! What a mess!"
1,Broken Treat Dispenser,"The first dispenser I purchased arrived broken. The plastic piece that holds the rotating wheel onto the dispenser had snapped during shipping. I returned the first dispenser for a second one, and the second one arrived with exactly the same problem. I didn't try a third time, and am still waiting to see if I get reinbursed for shipping charges."
3,Class warfare,"It is 1942. Mrs. Roosevelt and schoolchildren discuss bombs. Louis Howe, the President's confidant, has been dead for six years. Missy LeHand is ill. The Soviet Foreign Minister, Molotov, is visiting. The Russians bring their own vodka to the cocktail party. They are suspicious of the shaker of martinis.A golden blonde appears in the Blue Room. The Secret Service is summoned. The death is not accidental. Her name is Emily Ryan. She was twenty eight years old and an orphan. Miss Ryan worked for Stephen Early, the President's Press Secretary.It seems that Emily had saved her carbon paper and by such means slipped stories to a radio commentator. Mrs. Roosevelt discovers that Don Pettengill, (his mother was a Cabot), is engaged to be married to Barbara Lowell. Armed with such knowledge she begins to unravel this ably told mystery."
2,Too Small,"I bought this goggles three days ago because they where thermal and i liked the looks but it is too small, i cant even get the chin strap to fit in."
4,Very subtle scent,"I actually like this a lot, even though the scent is slightly lacking. I wish it came in a bigger size. I like the atomizer, great light spritz, no shower."
3,Underrated Oldies,"Bought for just one song, ""Sixteen Reasons"", this album was a pleasant surprise including a lot of songs very characteristic of the late 50's - you either love 'em or loathe 'em! Very 'easy listening'. Similar feeling to some of Lesley Gore's stuff and Debbie Reynold's ""Tammy"". The recording quality is good but no information on the songwriters - for me, very annoying. I'd buy it again."
3,Appalachian Swing,I purchased the Cd for a few cuts that feature Clarence Whites Signature flatpicking style. Listen To the Mockingbird is a prime example of Clarences ability to take a standard and put his own unigue crosspicking style on it. The Cd is a good cd but the quality of the mix was somewhat lacking when compared to todays standard. The talent is still there however. I view this as a must for any flatpicker that wants a lesson on the way flatpicking should be done. When you learn to play like Clarence could please give me a call and teach me if you can. Kip
4,Fun pedal; cool look,"This is a fun pedal that allows you to dial in the tone you want. I particularly like how you can adjust the amount of effect and the up/down nature of the envelope. Very cool VU meter that helps you get the levels right. There is a bit of a learning curve with this, but once you get it down it's a lot of fun. Works a bit better with my Ibanez with active electronics than with my Fender Jazz Bass."
3,how can I live this product,"if it didn't match up right or was damaged I would hate it, but I can't really love a wiring harness."
5,An excellent book with great photos.,"This book covers the development, testing, and enough of the technical details of the 777 to keep any reader interested. Lots of great photos, and the last section of the book shows the planes that were delivered to the airlines that were the launch partners. I believe that this book is better than the one by Wagner et. al."
2,"Warming sensation? Dang, I say burning sensation.","This stuff burns a bit and it smells medicinal...really weird. I thought maybe my tube had been tampered with so I bought a second tube. It still burned and it still smelled bad. The real funny thing is when I use it on my husband (you will just have to use your imaginations here) it ruined my nail polish. Yep, must be strong stuff. Now I know why it burns me. Interestingly enough is it doesn't burn my husband. I won't be buying more tubes."
1,"Awful, sticky mess - going in the trash","Wow, maybe this stuff is a step up from Vaseline, as per the reviewer below, but as far as real lubricants go this stuff is terrible! So sticky and thick, it's very unnatural and gross feeling. This is the worst lube we've ever tried - thick and as sticky as molasses. So uncomfortably sticky that I can't even stand to have this stuff on my hands let alone on more delicate areas. And NO warming sensation whatsoever. Waste of $ and going into the trash."
1,"i love their album more than anyone, but...","this falls victim to the 90s remix trappings, bad vocal samples, bits repeating to the point of, well, having no point. stay away. they have an awesome song on a comp called like this is electronica or something, get that, this stinks. and 25 of course is awesome, i love them don't get me wrong please."
2,Disappointing,I didn't really care for this book. I thought it was a little boring. There did not seem to be very much 'heat' between the two main characters. Everything was very predictable. I was hoping for more from Rosemary Rogers.
5,ME's best early album,"I'm a huge Melissa Etheridge fan. I don't remember where this album falls in her discography -- but in my opinion, it is her BEST album of her early albums. Most definitely one that all followers of her music should own."
5,An indispensable guide for car campers.,"This guide rates and reviews hundreds of campgrounds including county parks which are often overlooked by other guides. It is illustrated with black and white photographs and contains a helpful index by rating. Campgrounds are rated from 1 to 5. 5 means it is a perfect, not to be missed site; 1 means it is acceptable only when desperate.Reviews are one paragraph to a page or more in length and include reservation information, number of sites, facilities, maps and driving directions, as well as nearby recreational activities. Reviews give the reader a clear idea of what to expect from each campground. Look for key words and phrases that tell all: secluded, private, remote, too darn crowded, hordes of day visitors, or too much asphalt. This is a detailed, well-organized guide. Don't leave home without it!."
2,Not a great buy,"I have been researching camping in Yosemite using this book as a guide. From what I've found, this book is a terrible reference. The index gives the wrong page numbers for specific campgrounds, and the information given has turned out to be wrong for most of the campgrounds I have looked at. In trying to make my reservations I found errors ranging from whether or not the site required a reservation to whether or not RVs are allowed in the campground to whether or not there was running water at the site."
2,Not much of a book in my opinion,"As somone who used to date Dennis, I found his writings more entertaining then his actual personality.This book doesnt tell much that I couldn't find out from any other book.Good try though."
3,Bare bones,"This is an absolutely bare-bones biography of Florence Nightingale. It's written for early readers to learn a little about this famous nurse, with nine pages of very simple text and nine pages of photos. Because the text is so limited to the basic details of her life, it is rather dry and uninspiring. The book can provide an introduction to Nightingale, but should be enhanced with some discussion or other resources. An animated film called ""Florence Nightingale"" from the ""Animated Hero Classics"" (Nest Entertainment, Inc.) is helpful in giving children a better picture of this woman who accomplished so much in the field of health care."
1,Wanted to like it.,"Very difficult to swallow - huge capsules, and need to take 3 of them to get the beneficial dosage. Trying to swallow these on a good day is hard - but - trying to do it while dealing with morning sickness was nearly impossible. Breaking open the capsules and mixing it in to food wasn't pleasant either - while feasible it was bitter and difficult to get down that way too.The nutrition value is just what my body needs - but - since I am unable to sufficiently get it in to my system, it just isn't an option for me. Wanted to like it - but - it didn't work for me."
1,Get what you pay for,"There's a reason this chain is 1/2 the price or less of other chains: it's junk. I had mine on a Ninja 250R--pretty much the lowest-torque and lowest-abuse bike possible, and it still broke inside a month of normal driving. Save yourself the hassle of ending up on the side of the road and buy something better."
3,"Cute, eventually fell apart","This belly ring is very cute, but after a while it began to tarnish and the clover broke off. It just didn't last as long as I thought it should. (Only wore it about a month)"
5,The Facts and Nothing But the Facts,"I purchased this book on a whim, knowing of the authors' credibility. When I got in to it, I realized it was going to be more than I expected. This work discredits one by one all the ridiculous length claims on snakes from around the world. Instead of these (sometimes outrageous) claims, the authors provide you with THE FACTS AND NOTHING BUT THE FACTS!It is about time herpers spread the honest truth about these species to the general public, rather than the typical ""My python should hit thirty-five feet because that's the maximum size!"".This book is an educational experience for ANYONE with an interest in these species or herps in general. I wholeheartedly recommend it!The human attack accounts are pretty eye-opening, too!"
3,One thing that frustrates the heck outta me!,"The stroller is great, and rides very smooth. There is just one thing that really irritates me to death about it; the back wheel locks were very poorly designed. I will try my best to explain the design - the piece that locks the back wheels from moving is a bar that you push up or down - when the bar is down, the wheels are locked and the stroller does not move (this part works fine) - when the bar is up, the lock is released and the stroller is suppose to move freely, however, the bar does not stay in the ""up"" position and tends to creep back down causing the locking piece and the wheels to hit each other - this makes an annoying thumping sound and can't be good for the system."
4,Fun game for kids and their grownups,"My 6 year old daughter got this for Christmas. Both she and my son enjoy it, though it is a bit harder in the duet mode. The songs are familiar and fun if you enjoyed HSM. It also works with the mic from Rock Band for PS3, so we didn't have to buy another USB microphone. It didn't bother us a bit that the original cast wasn't singing the songs...they are decent covers."
1,eBook Error,"On Nov. 8, 2012 the free download has no content. Interestingly, the product desciption says ""The Marriage List"" will be available tomorrow for $0.99. Based on previous reviews perhaps empty content is a better deal?!"
5,Great Book,"I read a book a day and I will have to say this was a very good book. I love how May is not the usual character, she speaks her mind and stands up for her self. A very enjoyable morning read. I will read more of her books."
3,Sweet,"This book has no steamy scenes but is so sweet and romantic. I enjoyed the book, but while it was easy to read, I couldn't rate it higher than three stars because it really not my usual type of story. The plot and characters could use some more depth."
5,Good read,Fun story about what he thought he required in a wife and what he actually needed. Very Enjoyable to read.
4,The Marriage List,Loved this one so much I read the whole book in just one day! The next read will be another by Mrs.Dorothy!
3,The Marriage List,I enjoyed this from the first page to the last. If you like to root for the under dog you will too!
1,I Second the Vote for a 0 star option!!!!,"I second the idea of having a ZERO star option. This book (and I am being generous to call it that) was one of the worst I have read - or would be if I had been able to read it. At page 64 I abandoned the effort as an utter waste of time and skipped directly to the epilogue, which was equally bad and boring. The characters were cardboard, the dialogue atrocious and the plot, such as it was, non-existent. Like the reviewer who correctly panned this book, I simply cannot understand how anyone could have rated this book more than one star. I can only say, sadly, they have never read a truly good book.Recommendations: read Kinsale, Kleypas, James, Kelly, Smith or Ashworth and then try to convince anyone this was a good read.I'm simply beside myself that I actually paid for this book. It's too late for me, but save yourself. This book is not 'sweet' - it is silly."
2,The Marriage List,I'm sorry but I could not finish this book. It was not the style of book that kept me interested.
3,A drama indeed,"This story is long and painstakingly written, with so little hope for the principals you want to put them out of their miseries. The men are callous villains, manipulating the lives of the ladies. The ladies are frustrated individuals, vacillating between desperate grasps for happiness and self-sacrificial determination to throw over all happiness so others might be happier. The only humor in the piece is the horse. If you can make it through the first half of the book, you may well like the second half."
3,Sweet Little Romance,"This was a sweet little romance. It had a lot going on at once. I personally don't like stories with multiple plots. I prefer to concentrate on the development of the relationship of the principle characters. By my calculations there was at least 4 different plots going on. There was no sex in this story, just a few kisses. It was free when I downloaded it and I am glad as I don't think I would pay to read this story."
2,Faux Regency,"The reason I love historical romance is that they take me away to another era. That didn't happen with this book. The writing was fine but the author has no real feel for the regency period. When Viscount Evers stated that his ""ego"" was hurt I wanted to ask if Freud had gone back in time to give him a word that did not even exist in the time the book is placed. The author mixes the classes and has very little concept of the social structure of the aristocracy. She also doesn't know the difference between ""peaked"" and ""piqued."" Too bad. I am always looking for new regency authors worthy of this wonderful genre. If Miss McFalls devotes herself to more research perhaps she can improve."
5,I loved the story and the characters!,"The story is very well written: an injured and handsome lord, a girl with rumours of a gypsy ancestry, mysteries about her parents life or death, pressure to marry...All key characters have attaching personalities: energy, laughter, passion, friendship, and a wonderful horse.It could be made into a great romantic comedy on screen, starring an actress like Jennifer Lopez.Ms. McFalls, thank you for providing me with several hours of happy entertainment!"
5,"The Marriage List!! Wonderful story just wonderful, Loved it!","I absolutely LOVED this historical romance just as much as ""The Nude"". So if you read this and enjoyed it as much as I did you should definitely check that book out as well. This was sweet, cute, fun, and a little tear worthy at times. I would definitely recommend this and can't wait to read another of Dorothy McFalls books. :)"
4,"Well done, clean fun",Its nice to read an enjoyable book for fun and relaxation. I appreciate authors who can keep my interest without intamacies I don't need to read.
3,Worth the price,"I purchased this book based on reveiws and glad I did. I am always looking for new authors and Dorothy MCFALLS did not disappoint. I only gave the book 3 stars because the storyline is predictable. I was hooked from the beginning however I think the book dragged on and on. It could have been a few chapters shorter. Another issue is the difference between the treatment toward May by her dear friends' parents. Iona's mother abhorred her yet her father,the Duke, considered her part of his family. If he was so concerned about May, why did he wait until the very end of the book to show his interest. I just couldn't buy that part of the storyline nor the story about her parents."
4,The list is very good,"In reading the Marriage list, it makes you realize that what we think is important is really not. Everyone has their expectations but who we fall in love with does not always meet them."
4,The marriage list..,"The Author did a good job as she was able to provide the reason why the Viscount was unable to in fact honor his relationship with the lady he finally ended up marrying. She (his Wife) was able to apply an aggressive measure in order to bring the Viscount out of his personal ongoing ""me too"" ego. No doubt the Author has had some experience with Human Psychology. Thank you for your attention."
1,Major rip off!,"US$47.99 for 12 songs which are also available in other Hollies'compliations? Thank you but no thank you. As a matter of fact, I always don't understand as to why those CDs issued under a Japanese label can differ so much from those issued under regular US/ UK labels. For a regular Beatle album for instance, the Japanese edition can easily cost you 3 times more than those issued by EMI, while the quality is very much the same. Strange."
5,"Concise and highly informative, an absolute must!!!!",Eric and Rob Deslauriers take you along their exciting world of skiing through a well thoughtout and easy to follow progression of tools and techniques to show you how to handle a variety of snow conditions for all types of terrain. The book covers in understandable terms how to approach different situations and what drills to practice to prepare you for any situation. In addition to the outstanding instruction each page is beautifully illustrated with the work noted ski photographer Hank DeVre.If you are an advanced skier or ski teaching professional this is a must have book.
4,Saunter -- The Chapbook,"I read McKinney's chapbook, Saunter, and found it to be a challenging yet rewarding meditation on silences, zen-like openings and the fractures of langauge. Poetic wildness in the Thoreauvian spirit."
3,"Great book, but pages fall out.","I ordered this book a couple of weeks ago, and enjoyed reading the first chapter, but pages began falling out in large chunks, so I returned it. Thanks to Amazon's excellent return policy, I had a new copy in 2 days. However, after reading just a few pages more, pages began falling out again. I will return the second copy and have already ordered an older printing of the same book in hopes that it is bound better.What I was able to read was interesting and very well written. Hopefully the next copy will hold together long enough for me to finish reading it.The info for the defective copies:Publisher: Interlink Publishing GroupPublished: June 15, 2000"
5,MST3K - what can you say?,I L-O-V-E MST3K. Even the bad movies are good when the crew gets hold of them. I really cannot add to what has already been said - I am now waiting for the next boxed set to be put out!
1,not funny,"i used to work in a ""hip"" clothes shop which had a selection of 70's fashion which people who were going to 70's fancy dress parties would purchase while laughing in hilarity at how bad these fashion items were. what was really funny though was what they were actually wearing at the time - the blandest most boring clothes that infact redefined boredom, making clothing that would previously have fallen into the category of boring require a new classification along the lines of not boring. if you are one of these people you will enjoy the ""jokes"" of mystery science theatre as they ""make fun"" of films which have more life and vitality in one minute of their existance than mystery science theatre has in hour after hour of it's humour free existance."
2,A Big Disappointment,Bride of the Monster and the Chevrolet Sales short were absolutely hilarious. It's MST3000 at their best. But the remaining 3 movies were a total bore. They don't even make funny comments during the movie. I guess they used up all of their good material on Bride of the Monster.
5,Great starting place!,"This is probably the best book for those who are new to the Prophetic. It does an excellent job of outlining the history and basics of the gift of Prophecy (and Prophetic Intercession), teaching fundamentals that are needed to operate in ministry, and to recieve prophetic words more appropriately. More important than the information it provides is the fact that it motivates you to minister prophetically, and addresses much of the fear we have when we begin to operate in that realm. This book was not only packed full of information and encouragement, but Cindy Jacobs does an excellent job of making it an effortless read. In fact, it would have been easy to read in one sitting, had I not been so engrossed in the learning that I had to put it down each chapter and think and pray about each section. Overall I greatly recommend it for beginners who are just learning, and even the more seasoned ministers that need an encouragement boost."
5,Great book on the prophetic!,I hung on Cindy Jacobs every word in this book. She gives practical and insightful tips in how to grow in your gift and how to avoid many pitfalls. This book will save you a couple years of heartbreak because of mistakes. A true fast-lane approach to learning how to be effective in the prophetic!
5,teacher,This book has been amazing to me: has helped me answer many questions concerning my calling also my dealings with people. Has helped me understand why things have happened the way they are in my walk with the Lord. If your called to the prophetic or to intercessory prayer it will be a great tool to have. God has many anointed writers that are producing great books to help us fulfill our callings in Him;( Cindy Jacobs )is one of those. I have been blessed in reading this book and cannot say enough about the fact that so many of my questions over the past 30 years concerning me have been answered in this book. This book will help anyone that is teachable and desires to move on in their walk with the Lord.
5,Extremely beneficial,The Voice of God was a gift from the Lord through Cindy Jacobs. It is so beneficial if you have been gifted with the Prophetic gift and you have questions. This simple straight forward book answers those questions. It explains how the prophet should partner and operate in the church and defines protocol which is so important to understand. For me personally it was a huge watering can into my life to promote growth. I have also read Cindy's book Women of Destiny and am convinced that this woman is an annointed voice and leader of God.
4,Nice starter mic,"I bought this for my daughters, along with a Behringer mixer. It is rugged and quite decent. It is large in size. I suggest buying the sponge mic covers and a stand."
3,It's okay,The microphone is okay. I've had better microphones for around the same price but their prices have gone up since I last bought the namebrand I used to have. So this one will do just fine.
3,Works but magnets fell out!,It looks great and fits nicely on my husband. Does turn wrist green but all copper will. His back pain has cut in half. He wore it for 28 days and one magnet fell out I will be sending it back to get another one. it works for him so we will just keep replacing it if it keeps happening.
3,Nice looking bracelet,"After my wife wore the bracelet for about an hour, one of the magnets fell out. Found the magnet, glued it into place, but broke the magnet while putting it in place. Very small, cheap magnets. The bracelet itself, is well made. My wife has not noticed any improvements in her health since wearing it."
2,A Rushed Book,"Better called as a booklet, this 40 pages book was rushed out to press, so it came full of spelling mistakes, which becomes very irritating as you keep on trying to figure out what did the writer mean to say.Although the fact remains, the writer could have pilled up 300 pages, to be only abbreviated to 30 pages, but still such booklet in no way deserves the 10 U$ price tag.If you like small booklets, go for it, otherwise, look elsewhere. I feel cheated after purchasing it though !"
1,very[faux],"This would have been a great approach if real mothers were photographed with their own children. As I read the names of the `mothers' and the babies it became apparent what a staged affair this is. We could only find one immediately postpartum woman. Apparently Anne is not above our culture's belief that women must be thin to be attractive. Pregnancy and postpartum body shapes are interesting, natural, and beautiful to those that understand the complex beauty of childbirth. Anne, given her standing as a photographer, missed a great opportunity to portray what is natural is truly beautiful and worth pondering. In many ways I am not comfortable with this book on my coffeetable."
1,Not so great,"While Anne Geddes definately takes brilliant newborn shots, and this book is a welcome departure from her other work, I found her treatment of the women very poor. For example, one model named Emma, appears to be a victim of starvation. And it's particularly disturbng to see Emma with her ribs and hipbone protruding from her body cradling a newborn with the title, ""love"" or ""pure"" beneath. The babies' ages are listed in the caption of each picture, it would have been really interesting to see a truthful representation of a mother after 2 days or 2 weeks as well as the baby. Alas, another example of our culture's insistance that women, at no time ever should have an ounce of fat on their bodies."
5,Simply Beautiful,This book is incredible! It is on my coffee table for all to see!!! Anne Geddes really outdid herself on this one.
2,Creepy!,"Generally, I think that Anne Geddes stuff is cute. Babies are hard to make ""not cute."" Somehow, Anne Geddes manages to make a book of creepy pictures of women and babies. There are SOME cute pictures, but, again, mostly just creepy with naked, thin women and some poses that take you a minute to figure out exactly what's going on (and not in a good way). Also, for a book whose sole purpose is to showcase photographs, the book is relatively small in size and hard to look at. You should probably get your baby fix elsewhere."
5,lovely photos,if you like the photo in the cover you will enjoy the rest of the book! it gets even better...
5,Original and beautiful,"Fleming's novel, The Temple of Optimism, begins in a rather odd, impressionistic fashion, but quickly adopts a more conventional narrative form. The characters are interesting, and yes, it is a love story, but what's wrong with that? No, it isn't Jane Austen but I wasn't expecting her. Nor was I expecting the originality of the vision, the basic fun of the good guy and the vigor of the bad guy. He convincingly puts philosophy in the mouth of his villain, and joy in his hero. Wonderful."
3,The Good Old Days.,"This story was like going back in time similar to CITY OF DREAMS and SHADOWBROOK in America. However, Winterbourne was located in rural England of 1788. Written by a Scottish sheep farmer who has worked as a bookseller and accountant, some of the descriptions are imaginative and artistic.The death of the mother who'd abandoned her son but whose body was brought back to the estate for burial in the English cemetery was a turning point. He'd felt guilty but actually she chose to leave the surroundings to live in a city to forget the past.This was a good first novel, and he brings the varied characters to life with his novel way of expressing things. The jacket painting of the estate, farm animals, hills and valleys, with the tricorn hats on the men, and the clouds overhead show Derbyshire as it once was. I did not find a great deal of 'optimism' in this tale."
2,Not Jane Austen,"The book jacket compared this novel to the work of Jane Austen. As I read it I found myself disappointed. It is more of a cheapish romance novel than anything I've read by Austen.Some of the characters are interesting, even likable, but they are inconsistent. The flights of fancy are improbable. They are more along the lines of what you'd see in Anne of Green Gables (which were fine for a young girl, but not as fitting for adults).The author also underestimates the strength of the culture. Tolstoy's Anna Karenina gives a better account of the consequences the main characters could have expected from the course of their actions. The writing style and attitude are contemporary to 2000, not 1788 despite the setting.Maybe I would have liked the book better had I not read the Jane Austen reference. It's too late to tell, but it isn't too late for you. Be warned: this book is not what you're looking for if it's Jane Austen you like."
5,Simple but good,"This book was short, simple but was a great book. I highly recommend it for any teacher, grades K-21.Best in ideas of where to get supplies and save money."
5,Cute & fun!,"Lots of fun and cute ideas in here!If you consider making your own minialbum - buy this book!It makes you look at everyday objects in a whole new way - and if you get as inspired as I was, you'll end up with LOTS of pretty new journals.I really, really like this book and I tend to flip through the pages for inspiration - even when I'm not doing journals, since the designs are SO great!:)"
2,Not what I expected,"Okay, so I didn't read the actual blurb, but I wanted a book about ART journals, not about making journals. But, if you are looking for good ideas for cute journals ... this is it. Lovely art work and clear instructions."
3,Leaves Something to be Desired,"This product is great for people who travel or spend a lot of time on the go. However, one thing that is missing is the ability to easily transfer your existing music from your computer to your Gremlin. It does not come with any software and runs off of the Windows Media Player (with an included USB cable) so unless all of your music is already on that program, it's going to take some doing to get it transferred to the Gremlin. Although it would be perfect for someone who is just starting out in the MP3 world and has not yet built a large library."
5,daughter 2 1/2 loves angelina,"my 2 1/2 year old daughter loves angelina balletorina, she interacts with the video picks up great motor skills as far as dancing with the characters. the video also has great morals to the story which is a plus."
4,"Cute DVD, if you have a young girl!","We actually just watched this the other day. It was the first time for us seeing Angelina and I just loved the story line with this one!!! Not to mention all little ones love singing and dancing!!! So, with this DVD, they are sure to get up and have fun with them!!!Super cute, but it did seem sort of short compared to most kid ""movies."""
4,there still Ain't No Sunshine,"A new take on Bill Withers classic. When it comes to covers of this timeless beauty, I'll still take Sting's version."
1,The Truth?,"After reading this book it made me do some serious research and I found that almost all of the critique is unpreventable and souldn't refelct negativley on this man. If someone like clinton was mayor I know it would have be much more catastrophic. So this book just pollutes the minds of America, a lot like some politicians."
5,Running out to buy it,"Why do we non-Republic Party members have to be so fair and balance when even today Murdoch, their Soros, maybe richer, has promoted a virtual Citizen Kane style run to one of the biggest disasters in Amurikan history, in the chaos Bush created the stealing can continue with YOUR MONEY...I love the way the Republic Party makes it THEIR money when their in the White House, and YOUR money when they campaign for their phony ""tax cuts"" political mega-phone, Rudy is just a tool in the myth of 9=11, I'm a native New York currently living in CA. He's just another pimp and the southern/midwestern radicals will NEVER accept his brand of NE Republic politics...it works in NYC not AL, TX, GA, LA, boyh!!!! Have a great ""election"" with McCain and Ms Triangler Clinton....this country has problems"
2,Revisionist History,"This book and it's alleged documentation belongs in the same pile as ""9/11 Remembered"". While conspiracy theorists can't help themselves when it comes to creating history, these authors should know better. The book is a light read and should not be taken seriously. It should be read by everyone who agrees that profit via the 9/11 disaster is only a pen-stroke away."
2,See this book for what it is.,"All this book is written to do is Monday morning quarterback a situation that nobody could have dealt with flawlessly. Giuliani did the best he could at the time and under the circumstances. This book serves as a political hit piece by people who would be critical of the man because of his politics and not because of his proven track record. In my opinion there is hardly anything in the book that stands up as honest and deserved criticism, and the things that do are acceptable to me considering the situation.In my opinion the authors knew darn well that if Giuliani runs for President, they would get all the interviews and book sales their hearts could want."
5,A Must Read,"As a person who experienced the horrors of 9/11 I found this book to be accurate, insightful and fascinating. The research that went into this book is impeccable. This is a must read for anyone interested in understanding the events of that terrible day."
4,Sweat Factory,This Sweat Factory exersize video is one of many in my collection that I like working out to. I like the moves because they are not complex. There are only three dancers so you get to see the full body when they move and the music is upbeat. The video is only about thrity minutes long.
5,unforgettable,"It truly was unforgettable. For those readers who are tired of the same old story, give Cassandra Jane a try. I wasn't sure at first if I'd like it, but it wasn't too long before I was hooked. I'd recommend this book for anyone who simply likes a good story."
1,Very poor clip design.,"The holster itself is fine. The clip is very hard to get on and off a belt. It's designed to stay on, no matter what - with apparently no thought to getting it off when you need to. I went out and bought a replacement at Kmart."
4,Works well but unraveled,"I had a very painful separated rib which didn't begin to heal and feel better until I started wearing this belt. Unfortunately, the stitching unraveled after the 4th or 5th day of wearing it (although I was wearing it pretty much 24 hrs. a day). Regardless of the unraveling nuisance, the belt was invaluable for my healing, plus the female version of this belt (the doctor only had the male version) made a big difference as well. The price was low enough that I'll forgive the unraveling...plus it made my life so much easier and less painful while I healed -- highly recommend!"
3,"Well done (pun intended), but not for everyone.","This film approaches its subject quite seriously though it would have been pretty easy to turn this into some bad B budget exploitation film. Definitely bizarre and disturbing; it's not for everyone, but admirable in the way it handles its tale based on true events and people."
3,Appears perfect.,"I have enjoyed perusing this book, but I have not found the time yet to actually try the samples in the book."
2,Black and white photos.,"With modern printing and stuff, to receive a book like this with black and white photos and paper that feels, well, lower end, was very disappointing. I didn't expect each instruction photo in color, but the finished product certainly should have been.I showed this book to a crafting friend, without telling her my opinion, and she said exactly the same thing, how disappointing it wasn't in color.The ideas are nice, but honestly, I could have looked up any of these styles on the internet. I was hoping for something a little different, and definitely a lot better quality."
3,OK,"Nice, but I had seen most of these online. I will keep it for future use. Very good directions that are well illustrated."
5,Review of my book purchase,"I received my book in excellent condition and just love it! Thank you so very much.I will certainly do more business with you in the future and recommend you to others as well.Sincerely,Pat Novakoski."
5,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone review:,"I loved the cd! John Williams uses some themes frequently around all the songs, but I don't mind because the chosen themes are really good. My favorite is #19 (Hedwig's Theme). Though #11 (The Quidditch Match) was a bit of a disappointment it's still a really good song. I say you have to have read the four books to really appreciate the music. It's not enough to read the first one or see the movie. Trust me you'll enjoy a lot more this way."
5,Harry Potter Soars!!!!,"Not since ""E.T."" has John Williams crafted such a mesmerizing and evocative score. As if the movie needed any other excitement generator, this score will definitely drive up the interest level, and bears repeated listening. Williams has given the music his characteristic emotional intensity and symphonic lushness that leaves the listener wanting even more. Buy the CD, see the movie. The world needs a hero like Harry Potter right now!"
4,"Safe, Typical Williams","Another year, another nomination for John williams. Although it doesnt come as a surprise that this score would be nominated this year for an Oscar, the big surprise is how much it doesnt deserve it. Now dont get me wrong, I am the BIGGEST john Williams fan out there. I guess this makes me even more critical of his work. He's been responsible for Raiders, Star Wars, and ET to name a few so there is no excuse that the score to HP has to be so safe and middle of the road Williams. hedwig's theme is great but the entire score suffers from Williams' love of it. Almost every track has portions of it and after awhile, it begins to get old and annoying. The real jems on this cd are track 2 (harry's Magical world) and the Chess Match. If you are just discovering John Williams' music, you wont go wrong getting Harry Potter despite how lackluster and typical it is."
5,Harry Potter CD,The Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone CD arrived on time.It was well packed.The service was excellent. We love it.
5,Beautiful,"It didn't take me long after seeing the movie to realize that I needed to get the soundtrack. There is just something about it that I won't lie. It gives me goosebumps. Especially ""Harry's Wondrous World"". That track right there is what put me into Harry Potter's world. I have every movie, every soundtrack, and every book.The music on here, as well as the other seven soundtracks, is beautifully done and for me is what defines Harry Potter. If you are a fan of Harry Potter, or of instrumental soundtracks, you should definitely get these. You won't be sorry."
4,A magical score,"I really enjoy this score. I find it to be magical and wonderful to listen to. I highly recommend this to any fans of John Williams, Harry Potter, and of scores that are just a joy to relax to. The only complaint that I have is that this is no where near a complete score. As anyone who has seen the movie knows, there are several key scenes (Dark forest, troll attack) that are missing and that is too bad. I hope that one day they release an longer version, but for now, this will do nicely!"
4,'Sorcerer's Stone' Score Like Magic!,"I had been looking for this score ever since I got into the ""Harry Potter"" craze a few years ago. Next to John Williams's stellar score for ""The Prisoner of Azkaban,"" this is my favorite HP score.What's magical about Williams's music here is how strongly it evokes the imagery from the film -- a fact that can be said about most of his music. From the quiet opening of Prologue, to The Quidditch Match, and through to the end credits of Hedwig's Theme, we can relive the fun and excitement we experienced while watching the film.I recommend this CD for any fan of the Harry Potter movies and John Williams's music."
3,Twinkly? Magical? Heard it before?,"It's a slick production, and Williams and his team have done a decent job. The Main Theme (Hedwig's theme) is mysterious and magical, and provides a childlike wonderment to the opening of the disc.Shame then that Jurassic Park motifs should pop up here and there, and the Gringotts goblins have similar cues to JarJar Binks and the Ewoks.Works well as CD, if a little loud on occasion - turn up the volume to hear the fantastic celeste solos, and then a 90 piece orchestra boots you in the face with asteroid and pod race music. You may need new batteries for your remote...Still, it's a good CD, although not his best, and it's not the LSO (not that it matters).So buy it, enjoy it for a week or two and then shelve it with the rest of your Williams collection."
2,"Like many horror stories, it had a good beginning...","For a composer of the calibre of Williams, I expected more than a bland rehashing of Harry's theme every two minutes in the soundtrack. In other compositions, Williams executes variations that thrill the ears and engage your imagination. Not so in this soundtrack. Repetitive, overblown, and not what I expected from such a promising project as the Harry Potter movie."
2,Star Wars Christmas,I being a huge fan of the Harry Potter books was excited about the movie. I bought the soundtrack the second day of release and was disappointed. There is not much variation in the music and it comes off sounding like a star wars christmas cd. I think we all know that John Williams can do a lot better than this.
1,"the music was just too ""indiana jones"" like...","it didn't fit very well with the movie theme. It was too ""John Williams"" to a fault. It was a big disappointment. I'm selling mine to a die-hard Harry Potter fan."
1,Not Available,"I wanted this CD, but after ordering it, I got the Chamber Of Secrets instead - twice! - the replacement copy was also the COS. I gave up at that point."
1,such a ripoff composer,"It's quite funny to see people rave about the beautiful ""Hedwig's Theme"" melody.Yes, it was beautiful when Tchaikovsky composed it 150 years ago as the Andante from his ballet ""Swan Lake.""Williams shamelessly copied the melody for his ""Hedwig's Theme"". I'm a little astonished that the producers let this plagiarism slip by, but perhaps they're still waiting for spine donors.Williams also steals other music from himself as well as classical composers for this score. It's a shame that once he hit his sixties he can't be original anymore.Or maybe it's Alzheimer's disease and he just can't remember that someone else wrote it first..."
3,Year One Begins!,"I have been a John Williams fan for some time now. Since his music in Star Wars, E.T., Jaws and Indiana Jones grabbed my ears and my attention, I have followed the music where ever it played. When he did Harry Potter though, I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, John Williams is incredibly talented in movie scores, but the first Harry Potter he slipped a bit.John used to be able to make music so when you listen to it you can visualize the scene. In this CD you can't for some of the tracks.Besides that small thing, I would recommend this to any fan of John Williams or any soundtrack lover. In the end Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone-Soundtrack gets 3 Stars out of 5.My name is Amone. Adios!"
4,WOW!!...WOW!!,"Good God!!..John Williams this soundtrack is fantastic. Buy it!! Track after track it is unbroken in quality. When up against other pieces of John Williams work such as the 'Star Wars' music, this really is something to love over and over again! My personal favourite tracks are tracks: 3)The Arrival of Baby Harry 4)Visit to the Zoo and letters from Hogwarts 16)The Chess Game and 19)Hedwigs Theme. Those tracks are magnificent...so energetic, loud and atmospheric, they really do suck you in and each of them lasts for an incredibly decent length of time just like all the others. With a maximum of 19 tracks each 5mins minimum and the extra bonus CD ROM this is the ultimate movie soundtrack, classical album and movie clip companion. Well done John, it it remarkable!!"
4,JW and HP,"Even if I didn't like Harry Potter, I would have still bought this soundtrack, for the reason of it is done by John Williams. I have so many soundtracks by Mr. Williams that its not surprise that I bought this one. Oh it is just such a plus that it is the Harry Potter soundtrack and by John Williams....guess I should go and see the movie."
5,Pure Magic,"If I've ever heard a CD that sounded magical, this is it. It fit the movie very, very well. Just listening to it you start thinking of Harry Potter and scenes from the book and movie. They just seem to dance through you're mind. I very highly recommend this CD to any one who likes Harry Potter or anyone that just likes mystical sounding music. You reall feel as if you yourself are Harry Potter and you are experiencing his adventures."
2,Definitely a pleaser,"I simply love this soundtrack. As I listen to it at this moment, I can just hear the quality that's put into each track. Almost all of them have the same basic theme, but variations of it are thrown in to give each song a unique touch. My favorite has to be ""The Quidditch Match"". It may be eight something minutes long, but it's got a feel of excitement in it. What's great about these songs is that if you've seen the movie once or twice, you can see the scenes being played out with the music, because the music is obviously straight from the movie. I think this is definitely a great one to buy, especially if you appreciated the great music of the movie."
4,Very Good!,"This score is very Hook-like, but unfortunately not in the same caliber as that score.However, it succeeds on a level that it's a book score, not a movie score for something that was always a movie.If that didn't make any sense, here's the lowdown:This is a great score!"
5,simply amazing...,"John Williams' newest piece of work is wonderful. As a *HUGE* fan of Harry Potter, I made sure to get this CD hot off the presses. Be warned however, it's going to give you the very same shock it gave people when they rushed to buy the Titanic CD: it's all instrumental. Nonetheless, it is a simply superb CD. The music is amazingly put together and is wonderful to listen to--you can really see every scene playing out in your head. I highly recommend this CD to any Harry Potter fan, or for that matter, any person who just likes good music. cheers and butterbeers! -emily"
4,It too cheerful....,"I thnk that the soundtrack is okay. I wish some that some of the music wasn't so cheerful. Harry Potter story is not really a cheerful one. That ""Prologue"" piece is going to be as famos as the ""star wars"" theme and ""superman"" theme. For my I would have put a little bit of mystery in the song. I wish they would have made music called ""Harry theme"". I also wish John Williams would have not stoped after the 2nd one. I would have love to here his ""Volemorts theme"""
3,one of Williams best?,"I wouldn't consider it one of John William's best scores, but it does have some wonderfuly written peices like Hegwarts Theme to just name one. The beginning of the soundtrack is very good (that's why it give it a 3 rating) but as you get towards the end of the soundtrack, you lose interest in the music because the melody isn't has strong as the beginning nor does it have enough difference between intraments. This is rather unusal for Williams because he usalley is very good at doing this.I think Williams does better at the non childrens movies like Schindlers list, Jurrasic Park, Jaws, Indian Jones, ect. The songs from those have a more deeper 'realistic sound' then much of the Harry Potter CD which seems to lean towars the more childis, almost 'corney' sound that doesn't seem to do well.The good side is that he created a WONDERFUL theme song to this movie that does goes well with the movie and I think it will be a remembered peice like the Jurrasic Park theme, or Jaws theme."
3,Too Childish to be fully exciting.,"John Williams has done some awesome scores in the past for Xmas movies (Home Alone) and this is no exception. But unfortunately, because Harry Potter has a large audience of kids, this score doesn't go all the way in being exciting enough to get your pulse racing or to be truly magical. Which is a shame considering the movie is all about magic. There seem to be about 2 main themes that are used a little too often without the use of sub-themes to us feel what characters feel or have more emotion in plot developments. Williams just seems to use the images to have a large orchestra booming. Not much of an atmosphere is created and the entire score seems too generic to stand out from Williams' previous work or anyone else's. It's quite bizzare that in a CD lasting over 70 minutes very few themes could exist or be developed and embelished. Pick this one up cheap if you really want it."
5,Among Williams's best!,"John Williams is my favorite composer and I love all of his music, but Harry Potter takes the cake for what I consider to be some of his best work!! It's not just that the music is both beautiful and exciting... it's that it so completely captures the essence of the books and the films, it's amazing. Positively wonderful, and one of my favorite CD's!!"
2,Outdone,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the best soundtracks I own, and I own Lord of the Rings, Monsters Inc., Jurrasic Park, Star Wars, and A.I.(just to name a few). Yes, many parts of the score sound just like the other John Williams's scores like Jurrasic Park and Star Wars, but he has finally perfected his writing. John Williams has outdone himself on this score. When I listen to this music, I do not feel as if it is a soundract to a movie; rather, I feel as if he did not even have the movie in mind. The music flows perfectly, never stopping aprubtly. It creates a music statement that brings to life all the events and characters of Harry Potter and the Sorcere's Stone. I suggest this CD to anyone who loves the way John Williams writes, any Harry Potter fan, and anyone who loves classical music. John Williams, you've outdone yourself!"
3,"Standard Williams score, but highly Derivative","I am not a fan of Harry Potter, never read the books, never saw the movie, but I am a John Williams fan so I bought the soundtrack. The music is standard John Williams. A fine main theme and several other supporting themes. Williams' Hogwarts theme captures the essence of magic in this score. However, many of the supporting themes are seem to be derived from many of Williams' other scores including Superman and Empire Strikes Back. Does this make Harry Potter any less enjoyable? No it doesn't. The music is still Williams' and therefore exceptional. Those looking for more original Williams music may be disappointed however. As a I wrote before standard Williams score."
5,The Harry Potter Soundtracks are winners!!,"I have both the first and second Harry Potter soundtracks and I think that they are perfect! All of the songs are so beautiful, especially ""Hedwig's theme"", ""Leaving Hogwarts"", ""Harry's Wonderous World"" and ""Fawkes the Pheonix"". All of these songs have such intoxicating melodies that will stick in your head the entire day. When you listen to the soundtrack, it will make the books and the movies seem even more magical and fun than they already are. I strongly recommend these soundtracks to any music lover. It is worth every penny!"
4,Walk through Diagon Alley and Entry into the Great Hall,"Aloha-This is a wonderful soundtrack; HOWEVERthe most wonderful track was left out - the one where Harry enters Diagon Alley for the first time, and he sees that everyone around him is magickal....ANDwhen the first-years are led into the Great Hall by Professor McGonagall and they see the splendor of the Hogwarts ceiling and tables of classmates that seem to stretch on forever.I, like the reviewer from Shawnee, KS was very disappointed that the track was not on the CD - to me, it's very uplifting.Otherwise, it's still a good buy."
5,GREAT!,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone soundtrack is one of Williams's best. ""Hedwig's Theme"" is the best song I have ever heard. The beginning tracks may be a bit slow, but later on it really picks up. ""Quidditch"" is awesome, ""The Face of Voldemort"" is creepy, and ""Harry's Wondrous World"" with its sweeping string section is very elegant. Over all I think this score definantly deserves 5 stars."
3,not quite what I was expecting,"I've had this book and cd set on my wishlist for a few years since I briefly looked at it in a bookstore. I recently decided to order it and was disappointed in the quality of the singing and felt the essays were not substantive. I wish I'd looked at it a little better in the store. This is a good fluff book to read, but you may want to consider a better cd and look into a book with more research or history on the hymns rather than simple essays on the nature of the hymns."
3,"Quite few, but some gems","I love Memphis Slim, but things doesn't work quite well with the Canned Heat company. I think that this offer doesn't start until we get ""Mother Earth"", where we find a pretty version of this ol' time classic. The one and really diamond is in fact the next track, ""You Don't Know My Mind"", very very cool."
5,Slim and Heat,"I am definitely biased,however this is a very listenable album.Purists will have their say but there's still life of a new type in the Canned Heat yet.Good solid piano and some tasteful guitar solos make this a good value listen,not a classic but eminently listenable."
5,Great workout!,"One word of caution...beginner. It really is best if you get the series (strength or stamina) and become really good at one of those first. This one is a little challenging if you are not in good shape already or if you unfamiliar with yoga poses.Otherwise, the tape is a solid workout and not too long. Before this workout I had a relatively weak upper body, but this has made me much stronger. I can now do several pushups, impossible five weeks ago.I have done tapes by three different people and I find Rodney Yee the best at explaining.It's true that he goes pretty quickly. MAny people who do yoga want a slow pace and more meditation. If that's you then this tape is not for you. But is you want to get stronger, more flexible and work up a ligh sweat, then this is the perfect tape."
2,too many downward/upward dogs,"i wish he did more unusal poses like pidgeon(?) @ the end.instead, i got an endless downward/upward dogs.second, not for biginners."
2,Aerobic Yoga?,"As a beginner to yoga, I was very surprised to see the fast pace of this workout. You barely get into position before Rodney jumps (literally) to a different one. He does not explain or talk you through most of this workout. It is very repetitious with lots and lots of upward and downward dogs and forward bends. I was disappointed with this video, as compared to Yoga for Athletes which sounds very, very daunting but has three levels of demonstration and Rodney slowly moves through the sessions and explains everything thoroughly. If this Power Yoga were the first one I had done, I would not have bought another."
2,Any different from Power Yoga for Strength,I ordered Power Yoga for Strength along with this video and felt ripped off as the routines weren't that different ... i wanted something that was focused on flexibilty and this wasn't it.Also this was shot in Joshua Tree National Park which was very distracting as Mr. Yee was doing his thing in a sea of tumbleweeds and Joshua Trees
2,Definitely Not For Beginners,"I'm very disappointed in this video. It's very fast moving (I guess that's what ""power"" means) and in the second half of the video, the postures are so advanced (hopping from one pose to another, positioning your legs OVER your shoulders from behind and balancing your entire weight on your hands). I think Rodney Yee has lost track of what is a ""beginners"" tape (somebody get this man a dictionary). You either have to be extremely advanced to complete this and do all the poses -- or else you have to be double jointed! Anybody want to buy my tape -- cheap???"
1,"If I could twist my body like that, I wouldn't need Yoga.","Forget this one folks, you would have to be a contortionist to even begin. I've done the Yoga Zone meditation tapes, and really enjoy those, but this one even says in the beginning you will work up a sweat etc.. I can tell you this: You don't sweat because there is no exercise. It is a matter of forming your body into impossible pretzel shapes. I really think you have to be more than a beginner to do this stuff. And it seems unnatural and actually dangerous. I tried it several times, careful each time to follow the instructions to the letter, and finally decided it was a definite no for me. I am in good shape normally, so it isn't a matter of being primed for it, it's a matter of being able to contort yourself like a rubber band."
4,Josephus: The Essential Works,"I ordered to use as a reference book to use in teaching a bible class. The reviews appeared to best suit my needs. I have not yet been able to use it, but feel it will be an aid in study and for presentation."
2,Poor recording quality of otherwise good music,"Yes, the performence is great.But the recording quality is very poor.Get the 5 CD set of his Paris Concert recoding."
4,Lost Elephant 6 band,"Just a dabbler in Elephant 6 (Apples, Neutral Milk Hotel, a little Olivia Tremor Control that didn't take, tiny bit of Of Montreal, some Sunshine Fix), I'd never heard of these guys. At least half of this album is terrific. Same Time, Same Place is the standout here. I love the way this guy puts chords together."
5,supper seller,I ordered this item and it was perfect. The seller was fast in shipping and at a low cost for the item. I would definetly buy from them again a 5 star seller
1,Filthy - dog will never see it!,"My dogs like to chew so I thought this might give them something durable to feed their addiction. The box arrived today, I opened it and you can see black marks all inside the box. I picked up the toy and it left black marks all over my hands that did not wash off with soap & water - had to use the industrial hand soap. I can't imagine having this toy bouncing around my living room carpets and light wood floors - YIKES!! Unless you have dark carpet or an outside pet, be warned! My dogs will never see this - disappointing because I think the concept is great and my dogs would have loved it-"
1,"Junk,","This thing came in dry rotted. You can tell this unit sat in a warehouse for a long time,Do not order this ,you are wasting you money and time.I threw it away.I rated at 1 cuz there is no zero!"
2,Light reading,"The lack of depth in this book was extremely disappointing. Topics are covered very superficially, leaving the reader wanting more. The serious student of Vedic Astrology would be better served reading the books of K.S.Charak & Ernst Wilhelm. For a good introduction, try James Braha's introductory work."
4,"Nice headset, but not in-line volume control","These headphones are very nice, compact, and light weight. They collapse to a reasonable travel size. They do not, however, have in-line volume control, which is the one of the main reasons I ordered them. Instead they have an in-line audio enhancer pack (like an amplifier almost). It takes two ""AAA"" batteries and you you can turn the enhancer on and off. You can use it without the enhancer, but the sound isn't as crisp."
3,"Comfortable, but lacks noise reduction of older Noisebuster model",I compared the Maxell NC-II to my older Noisebuster Extreme headset. I like the over the ear of the Maxell for comfort. I was hoping to replace my noisebusters which are on the ear and get uncomfortable after about 4 hours.I turned on 2 fans to generate noise and tried both headsets.My noisebusters removed almost all the fan noise. The Maxell did not. I am returning the Maxell's and looking for something better. Perhaps the new Noisebuster NB-FX or Plane Quiet NC6 will be better.
1,Look nice; poor quality,"The first problem with this set is the space for the batteries is attached to the cord itself. There's a large box on the headphone cord that, after you put batteries inside of it, it gets quite heavy. Despite this, the sound quality was just fine. About a month or so after I got these though, the right speaker went out. This is due to a loose wire. I move around a lot and every time I would stand up, the box on the cord just hangs down around my waste, with no clip or anything like that to keep the weight off of the cord. After a month of this, the wires inside just gave out.Poor design keeps this model from being useful. Get something...ANYTHING else if you are going to be the least bit active with your headphones."
3,"Sound is great, but the overall design layout stinks","Like other reviewers have stated the battery pack is located on the cord midway between the headphones and the jack. This is cumbersome and uncomfortable. If the design team would have had a thimble-full of common sense they would have included an extra 6 to 9 inches between the headphones and battery pack so the battery pack could be put in your pocket leaving enough cord out so that you can freely move your head. I'm happy with the overall sound quality, so I would like to rate these headphones higher than 3, but I find the poor engineering in locating the battery pack too infuriating. Buy them if you want to listen to audio while sitting, but if you are active find something else."
2,Really sub-par,"The sound quality is okay and is probably on par with other products in the same price range, but the noise cancelling feature did not work whatsoever. In order to fully test the feature, I tried listening to music with it on and comparing the perceived background noise to when it was off. In short, I am able to hear my roommate entering the house downstairs while the noise cancellation feature is on and while listening to music without straining.The wires also seemed a bit cheap, and although they were new, they seemed as if they were going to short out.Overall, not a great product."
1,Horrible headphones,"I bought them under the impression they were noise canceling, but they are not by the slightest. The folding feature works whether or not you want it to, falling off my head and making it difficult to put on and take off. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Do not buy this!,"I bought this product just a few weeks ago at Walmart for $40. It has good sound on normal without the batteries. I haven't tried it with batteries because of the position of the battery pack. The battery pack is located on the cord and it is already heavy and bothersome without the batteries. I can't imagine what it would be like with batteries in them. As I said, I have only had these for a few weeks now and even though I never put batteries in them they already broke. Now only sound is coming out of the right ear piece. Another problem I had with them is that the fold-able feature is to flimsy. The band doesn't stay in a locked position. I would not recommend these to any of my friends. So, I suggest to not buy these. It is a complete waste of your money."
2,Chalk this up on the fake products list,"I am usually wary of products that propose that they are able to compete with other products of the same category, all while being a fifth of the price. Well, I fell for this one, and I encourage all those looking for real noise-cancelling headphones out there to avoid this product.The headphones themselves aren't that bad, but don't let their pseudo-noise-cancelling abilities sway you from another product in the same price range. When they can't even cancel the sound of a computer fan, I highly doubt they'll be applicable in any situations in which you have envisioned their use."
3,"OK for travel, but...","These headphones are nice to travel with but if you want something to use everyday I'd choose something else. The on/off switch for the noise cancellation is heavy and bulky, and the length of the cord from the headphones to the switch is a bit short, the unit dangles too close to the headphones and it won't reach your pants pocket. It's better for sitting (like on a plane) than walking. The folding headphones always buckle at the hinges when you're taking them on and off, which means you always need both hands to adjust them on you're head. The ear cushions keep falling off when I take them out of my bag. I'm going to glue them on before I lose them. On the positive side they are what they say they are, lightweight headphones that fit in a small pouch, sound is good and noise cancellation seems to work."
2,mixed thoughts,These headphones would have been great but they have a (2) AAA battery pack built into the cord.It is beyond annoying.Otherwise they would have been great.If you don't mind the above go for it...
1,Absolute crap.,"These headphones have mediocre audio quality. When the noise cancellation function is enabled the music quality goes down, and it doesn't cancel any noise whatsoever. A total waste of money."
3,Okay for the money,It's a hit and miss product. It is the cheapest noise cancelling headphones that are a brand that is known. BUT there are a lot better non noise cancelling for less and that are made better. Since no one goes into detail about the noise I will. I am wearing them right now. They cancel low frequency noise like a car or ac unot well. Lower male voices are dulled and if they are about 20ft feom they are blocked. The noise cancelling fails at the mid to high range. There is slight hum when the low end noise is a constant. Seema to do better with noise from behind you. I don't think this fits what most people think of but it would work in an airplane but not a noisy office or busy living room.
1,decent sound for $20 but bad build quality,"I bought these because they were cheap and had the noise canceling feature. However, even with the noise-canceling feature on, there was still a bit of hiss. That would be acceptable, but in 6 weeks, I've had two different pairs short out. The right side shorted out on both of them, and will come on and off if you jiggle the cord JUST right. I will be returning these, AGAIN, and needless to say, not getting another pair."
4,"works well, volume control would be handy","The product works very well. Because it uses 2 AAA cells it seems stronger and more competent than other units I have used, The battery box is on the cord, which allows for two batters and a sturdy and visible on.off switch and red light. My only suggestion would be to have a volume control as different selections are played at different levels, and it would be easiest to change the volume on the headphones,"
3,"Okay, but missing a lot.","After reading this book, I found myself asking many questions about the band. That is because the Author didn't do a good enough job in his research.Slipknot, therefore, remains somewhat of a mystery. There is really not a lot known about these guys. Considering the lack of information available on this band, I guess this book is worth reading. But honestly, you might be better off waiting for a more extensive book, which hopefully, someone will write in the future.More importantly, is the fact that this book was written at a time when Iowa was being recorded. Since we're almost in the year 2013, and since Slipknot has released two more studio albums since Iowa, this book is extremely outdated.This book is definitely only worth reading if you're a hard-core Slipknot fanatic."
5,Fantastic,The beard and wig looked great. It fit really nice and was comfortable even after hours. My grand-kids didn't even recognize me. Best Christmas yet.
5,Love Those Cows,"My 2 1/2 year-old son is obsessed with cows. We first picked this book up at the local library, and he was asking to read it several times per day. This is a fantastic book to introduce not only basic concepts to kids, but I also used it to present a bit of poetic rhythm as we read. In fact, we loved it so much that I'm buying it for him for Christmas."
4,Fun for everyone,Our whole family loves Cows Going Past! It has a nice rhyme and flow to it. The pictures are fun for the kids to look at and we get to hear 'Mooooo' on every page! I would recommend it for a baby shower gift or for a 1st birthday present. Enjoy mooing your way through!
1,A not so great investment,"I have taught allied health students for years and I can say that I was most disappointed with this book. It is surprising that Delmar Learning, who claim to be such a leader in health textbooks, would put their name on something this miserable. The terms are largely out of date, definitions are badly written, there are no illustrations and students (who apparently this is designed for) would find a hard time using this book. I hate to be so negative but in a word IT IS AWFUL!"
3,ok for school,i bought this for school and it was ok a lil outdated but perfect for looking terms up it was a bit on the heavy side so i left it home instead of takeing to class with me
5,One of my favorite books from med school!,"This is one of the best physiology books I have used in my first year of medical school. I learn by reading so I tend to buy a lot of books, and this is one of the only ones that is clearly written enough that I am going to keep it to help me study for boards. The boards style review questions are great, and having the computer diagrams that go along with the book has been awesome - I haven't used any other book where I could actually play with the concepts interactively online. So helpful!"
5,Great Routine for when you don't have a full hour,"I've been using this tape on VHS for years and finally had to upgrade to the DVD. I'd say it's on the advanced side of the Beginner's category, which was great because it kept me challenged at first and is something I still keep in the rotation. It should be noted, however, that it's mostly flowing yoga (often referred to now as Power Yoga), so compared to other Beginner's titles, this may be more challenging and will definitely get your heart rate up.I also like that it's only about 30 minutes, so I can almost always fit it in."
3,"Fun, but not all that easy","For a beginner, there are some poses on here that I definitely could not hold. I thought it was a good workout and taught me about different poses for strengthening, but it seemed more advanced for beginners in some parts with the balancing. I wasn't expecting easy, just maybe a slower paced beginning."
1,Not for beginners!,"If you are looking for a tape for beginners, don't look here. This program puts much strain on your back and shoulders, and you have to be EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE to do most of the moves. It is definately a waste of money."
2,"not bad but not great, definitely not for beginners","i agree that this tape is not for beginners. there are alot of poses and they go by pretty quickly. it would be hard for a beginner to keep up. even someone like myself who has some experience might be disappointed. i like that they go through alot of poses, but personally i don't think you can get much out of the workout if you're only holding poses for 2 seconds and then flying into something else. living yoga is a great series (i particularly like the upper body workout) but i didn't find this one to be up to par."
2,Not enjoyable for me,"Having purchased 3 beginner videos, I liked this one the least of all. The audio and video did not seem to co-ordinate and flow as well as any Rodney Yee video or Living yoga with Ali Mcgraw. I found myself frustrated trying to ""keep up"" and understand all at the same time and lost the ""energized calm"" I get from my other videos and yoga class."
4,Good 30 minute routine,"Suzanne offers a good, fairly challenging routine that takes about 30 minutes -- a good length for me in the early morning. Too many yoga videos spend a great portion of time on sun salutations and that can get repetitive. I appreciated that Suzanne's routine was not built around the sun salutations. I actually found the pace pretty relaxed (except in the standing series, which could have been slower). Suzanne has become more of a calming presence since her earlier videos. Don't let the title fool you either -- the video requires/builds upper body strength as well. At first this was a disappointment because I was looking for a video to use when my shoulder was bothering me, but now I enjoy this as one of my regular routines."
2,"Nice workout, but not for beginners","As many have said, this workout is challenging and not for beginners. It makes no effort to make a first time practitioner comfortable with yoga, and indeed is so intimidating in parts that I can see a true beginner simply shutting it off and finding another workout. Knowledge of yoga poses is assumed and transitions may look simple on screen, but a beginner would struggle with moving from downward dog to lunge.I enjoy the workout, and it does get your heart rate going a bit, and your body feels great when you are done, but this video is not at all for beginners. I am only giving two stars because the workout is decent."
2,"More time, please!","I have done Yoga before, so I am not a true beginner. I purchased this, though, since it said ""lower body"" and that is where I need to focus. I love the scenery of this DVD, love the fluid movements, and love how she explains moves. However, this goes by too fast. There is barely enough time to get into one pose before she moves on to another. If you're a beginner, this can be difficult (or if you're overweight like me and need time to get into positions). I think this would have been perfect had they allowed a smidge more time in between movements while still keeping the fluidity."
2,Good video but not for beginners,"This a good tape, but I do not think it should be labeled as for beginners. Her poses require flexibility that a beginner just will not have yet developed.Also, unlike other beginners videos, the instructor does not offer visual modifications to the poses for those not flexible enough to perform the poses as shown. Perhaps most importantly, she does not verbally address the fact that it's ok to not be this flexible as a beginner and that one should go at one's own pace.I found this video very frustrating and not at all nurturing."
3,"this cd is fairly good, but one track shines.","If you listen to any track from this cd, listen to euphoria's. Now that is a good song. Nice strong beat, with anarchic content."
2,Loved it while it lasted,"I liked the backpack while it lasted, but it lasted only about 6 months, then the zippers broke =( The backpack is huge!! It easily fits a computer and clothes for a short business trip and rolls well"
4,Much bigger than expected,"The bag is much bigger than expected! My husband is unable to lift over 20 lbs due to back issues. This rolling backpack makes him going back and forth to class so much easier, especially when he needs to take his laptop. Definitely worth the money."
2,Poor Wheel Design!..... fix that and it would be great,"I have purchased two of these rolling backpacks. Both have the same problem, the ground clearance for the wheels is insufficient to kee the wheel corners of the backback from getting destroyed real fast! ANY tilting or uneven surface while rolling will cause it to drag on the groung and chew up and wear through the wheel corners of the pack itself in no time! I really like tha pack, but I will no longer buy this item unless the serious flaw if fixed."
4,Hangs tough even after abuse.,"My 9 year old abused this backpack on a daily basis for third grade and it hung tough. The corners near the wheels will tear if you bang it against the stairs or curbs and the water bottle holder will rip when the backpack regularly tips over because my 9 year old likes to see how fast he can run with it before it tips over. You should definitely carry it up the stairs when you can. The compartments allow for you to place several books in there without being cramped for space. One feature my son used from time to time was the two inch expander in the main compartment where you just unzip it. The other small compartments allow for you to organize all of your school supplies in an orderly fashion. Overall, this backpack will treat you well if you handle it with care, but it will wear down on you (like most products) if you abuse it."
3,A LIL DISAPPOINTED,"I PURCHASED THIS BOOKBAG FOR MY 13 YEAR-OLD SON AND ALTHOUGH HE IS ROUGH ON EVERYTHING, THIS BAG WAS ROOMY BUT NOT AS DURABLE AS IT PROCLAIMS TO BE. THE BOTTOM BECAME TORN IN FEW WEEKS BECAUSE IT DRAGGED ALONG THE GROUND! THE MATERIAL CONSTRUCTION IS NOT GREAT EITHER BECAUSE THE TOP RIPPED ALONG THE CORNERS AT THE TOP! SO, ON SECOND THOUGHT IT'S NOT EVEN THAT ROOMY! TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, IF YOU CHECK THE MANUFACTURER'S WEBSITE, THE WARRANTY IS AN EMAIL SUBMISSION REQUIRING YOU TO WAIT FOR A RESPONSE. WILL NOT BUY THIS AGAIN!"
5,Great book set for all ages!,"This book set is great for all ages, but I highly recommend purchasing for teens as a graduation gift from high school. We as a society have really neglected teaching children about the proper use of money and need to do a better job going forward.Whether you are poor or rich, this book is for you. Everyone can learn something."
4,Roots music from a southern original,"This recording, which I believe is Norman's first solo outing, establishes a pattern of taste, tone, and vitruousity which continues to this day with his more recent offerings. While this one doesn't hold together quite as well as Whiskey Before Breakfast, there are glimpses of greatness that you wouldn't want to miss."
3,not sara's best,"They are just okay. Maybe too short. Only did them twice. Much prefer the candlelight yoga and fat burning yoga cds. Sara is the best, though!!"
4,Excellent,"This set is really great, especially if your schedule hardly allows you time for yourself. I like to try to do three in a row, making an hour long workout, and changing it up everyday. I will usually rotate two, and always keep the abs one in there as the third so I am working my abs everyday. I have to say the Weight Loss, Flat Abs, and Power Beauty Sweat are my favs. I have a curvy yet athletic build, so I personally do not find the Sculpted Buns and Thighs very challenging. I have always had to work a lot harder on my legs to see results.I am in love with yoga, so my only grip about these videos is that there is no real cool down at the end. However, these work outs are designed to be short and sweet, yet beneficial, so I can live with it. I truly think this set is a great way to fit in yoga every day and increase your balance, tone your body, and become more flexible."
4,Great experience,The product arrived promptly and in great shape. I am very pleased with this transaction. Thanks!!
4,great workout routine!,I have enjoyed every one of these! Highly recomended for anyone from beginner to advanced.
5,Great 20 minute workout,"This is a great 20 minute dvd when you don't have a lot of time and want to do something. I run and do pilates, but was looking for a change in my routine.I'm new to yoga and I love this - it really works you out, and Susan is a great instructor. I will now buy one of her other dvd's."
2,For beginner ONLY,"I was looking forward to get this Set, but when i play it, i was very disapiont, has too much talking and if you are not a beginner, do not get this DVDs."
5,I love it!!!!!!,I never really liked to workout. Now with sara's yoga makeover I look forward to yoga. It is only 20 minutes long and very effective. I mix up the cd on certain days and sometimes do 2 cd workouts. I highly recommend these cds.
4,"Wonderfully detailed, but mixed success with curly hair","This book is an excellently photographed guide to many beautiful braids and up-dos. I have tried several and received compliments. However, the book is geared heavily towards girls and women with straight hair. It is very challenging to do many of these styles with curly hair, even long curly hair. YMMV."
5,Super,My 11-year-old daughter wanted this book for Christmas. It's been fun braiding each other's hair. The descriptions in the book are very easy to follow.
5,A Classic,"This is a fantastic book for those having long, as well as shoulder length hair. It is full of wonderful styles (not just braids but buns as well) that are as gorgeous as they are classy. The instructions are excellent, and carry you step by step with the aid of very clear illustrations that leave no room for error.The pictures are gorgeous, the photography superb! I owned this book in the past when I had long hair, then, after cutting it, I gave it away to someone with long hair. Years later, with long hair again, I remembered how great the book was and wanted to own it again, so I ordered it from amazon. While there are so many styles to choose from, you'll probably want to try them all as they look absolutely fabulous! Now that summer is coming and one often wants to tuck long hair somewhere out of the way, this is the perfect solution to tuck it in classy hairdos! I can't recommend it highly enough!"
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I had no idea I would be so satisfied with a book I didn't even preview. This book is not only filled with unique braiding ideas but also demonstrates flips, tucks, buns, twists and wraps. Every one of these ideas was featured with pictures and detailed instruction. The only question I have now is... which one do I try tomorrow?"
2,Outdated,"This book is all about braids. I bought it when I was about 10. Yes, it can be helpful with teaching braids, but if you know how to french braid and do a rope twist, I don't suggest this book. The models reek of the '80/'90's. Some of the looks can be updated by a braid on the side but really, this is more appropriate for 13 & under. There are no ""styles"", just braids and it is very dated."
3,"Good book, but time consuming (or plain impossible) for long hair.","The pictures are good and the instructions are well written and (theoretically, anyway) easy to follow. However, for anyone with true long hair -- classic length or below -- nearly all of the hair styles presented will take far more time than most people want to spend in the morning. Trying to keep different sections from tangling up or mirror braiding/twisting themselves near the bottom is hard enough with the simple braids, but with the more complex ones, it gets headache-worthy. Some of the styles are just impossible to do by yourself at all when your hair is significantly longer than your arm reach.This is probably an excellent book for people with medium length hair (shoulder to middle of the back), but for those of us with long hair, it's simply okay. Nice to look at but not practical for everyday styling."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"My daughter has VERY curly hair!! I have to braid it all the time, or else it turns into a giant tangled shrub. So I am always looking for help...someone to not only explain, but SHOW me how to do a variety of braids. This book was just what I was looking for. The best part is the clear photos, and the step-by-step instructions make it simple to do. You could call it ""Braids & More for Dummies."" The book is NOT childish or smart-alecky. The scrunchies that are attached to the front of the book are not pretty, but it's a thoughtful Klutz trademark that they usually attach some item related to the book's contents.The book also has very sturdy binding and pages, and it lays flat. Highly recommended!"
2,ok in 1991...,this book was fabulous when i bought it as a five year old in 1991. it it definetly very dated and now more basic hairstyles are in. and nobody now in thier right mind should wear a scrunchie.
5,marvelous!,"This is the book that I've been wanting! I've only had it for two days, and this fumble-fingered reviewer has already successfully completed three styles (which ARE easy once you know how!). This one's a keeper for certain!"
2,Nothing New Here,"Very disappointing. There's nothing in this book that you can't find in hundreds of other Career books. Furthermore, there's nothing in this book specific to training careers...nothing to guide you on any unique characteristics of the field.It's just not worth the money. Better to get an old copy of What Color Is Your Parachute."
3,bosch diamond blade,Pricey for the blade quality- Cuts on ceramic tile were not as fine as hoped. Hence 3-stars for the value.
4,Nice Chair Cushions,Set Of Four Chair Cushions Paisley BlueThese are very pretty. Delivery was fast and easy. I would buy from you again. Thanks!
4,"Engaging mystery, terrific New Orleans details","This is the first Julie Smith book I have read, and I was very impressed. The mystery held my attention throughout. Her series character, a woman police officer named Skip Langdon, is very human...competent at her job, but trying to deal with a difficult boss, having her ups and downs with her love life.... The plot twist at the end came as a complete surprise to me. I will look forward to reading more Julie Smith mysteries."
5,Skip Langdon Series,Having lived in New Orleans for 8 years I can attest to the authors grasp of this unique city's social structure. It is the most accurate depiction of New Orleans I have ever read. Couple this with the great charcters she develops leads to most enjoyable read. I recommend this series without reservation
2,Needs editing!,"I cannot even finish this book as the editing stinks... It almost reads as if someone made notes and then the notes were not removed. Unless you can get this book for free (which I did), don't bother."
3,What's all the fuss about?,"I read such great things about this razor, and thought it might finally be the end of my underwarm shave bumps. Not so..... This razor did no better than the cheap disposables I'd previously used."
1,This is a fake,"I purchased this for my wife, who loves the Schick Personal Touch razor. Unfortunately this is NOT A SCHICK product! This is an off-brand, and in fact does not even include any refills. Do not purchase if you are expecting a Schick product."
2,Long Time User,I have used the Personal Touch Razor for over 20 years. I didnt know until last year when i needed replacment blades that they had quit making this razor. I had just thought the store was out until I googled it on line. I needed an additional head so that's when I learned of this. I ordered an off brand head that holds the razors and works fine but doesnt have the same slope to the head. So I baby my original head and keep praying I can order my blades on Amozon.com...
2,Not a great book,"I bought the book to learn about the Cisco Pix 515E but, there is very little to do with the PIX 515 EIn this book."
5,"Keep on rollin""","These Bearing were excellent, they fit right in and were easy to grease. I am glad that Timken continues to provide a great product. I would buy again."
1,Agree with other reviewers!!,"Could not finish this AWFUL book. Don't be fooled and waste even a dime on this!! E. Thornton is a great author, with lots of other books to choose from. Stay away from this one!!"
1,TERRIBLE ! Don't waste your time !,"I gave up on this book after forcing myself to endure 200 pages.The hero is a piece of garbage; I can put up with a bit of domineering, but this moron went way past that to bullying, physical abuse, and finally rape to get what he wanted. WHY would an author think we want to read this crap in a romance? Does she REALLY think that women want this kind of man in their lives? Only a masochist would!"
1,"Awful, awful, awful","I didn't like this book from the start. The hero in the book was a nightmare. Who could love a man who is constantly threatening you to hit you, forcing himself upon you and purposely ruining you? The heroine wasn't terribly likable either. I only made it half way through the book and gave up."
2,Disappointed,"I have read Elizabeth Thornton before and I must say that this book was very dark and disappointing. While she tries to portray the male lead as someone heroic, she fails. The near-rape scene towards the beginning made me almost put the book down, not quite sure how anyone, even the male lead, could think that action would open someone's eyes to their love for someone else. I kept waiting for the part about where they come to earn each other's respect and love and it never really happens. Deidre was a little too tenacious in hanging on to her past, but at least she has some redeeming characteristics, especially towards the end. I would not recommend this book."
5,Great value for the money,"These can be expensive lights to replace, but this bundle is a great deal for the money. About 1/2 the price of what I can find in the local store."
5,DIY Electrical Connection,I've always had tow hitches and the biggest problems I always encountered seemed to involve the electrical system. I wasn't looking forward to this part of installing my new hitch until I found this device. Wow! This thing installed easily and worked on the first go-round. Definitely worth the money!!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS WAX,When waxing the residue is hard to wash of your skin and even harder to wash of any sinks etc you might get it on. You cant store any left over for later because you cant get the residue of the roller head even when you use moisturizer and alcohol as instructed. NOT WORTH THE HASSLE. Buy Parissa or nair.
3,less than the sum of its parts,"This album was a disappointment to me when i bought it (as a cd) a few years ago. in fact, i've already parted with it! I do enjoy listening to 'solo' recordings made by members of the band: Joe Ely, Jimmy Dale Gilmore, and Butch Hancock. In concert too, they are wonderful--performing each alone, or as a band. But, this record just doesn't cut it! The songs are pretty good, but everything else is amateurish. When this was made none of them could do anything with the guitar--not even Ely, who has become the most accomplished of the three on the instrument. The vocal harmonies are lackluster. The production is poor (as to be expected under the circumstances). Overall: more a legend than a band, indeed! Hoping that the new studio album matches their live performances in quality, and that the inevitable advances that each has made as a musician since this early recording is likewise captured."
2,Musta Notta Gotta Good Listen,"I don't understand the hoopla regarding this More a Legend... cd. I picked it up a couple years ago after hearing JDGs After Awhile and seeing him with Ely & co. on Austin City Limits. If anything, this CD is an artifact - maybe it satisfies a curiosity for 70's country rock in some, but I don't believe I listened to it more than a couple of times. And when I hear people speak in glowing terms about Dallas I wonder what it was I had listened to. Maybe I did not have both speakers plugged in. Don't get me wrong - I think Jimmie Dale Gilmore has written or covered some of the best music done in the past 10 years, but the CD in question here ought better be named More A Vague Memory than A Band. Sorry to be so harsh."
2,poor quality,This cd sounds like it was made in a garage. The only thing that could have saved it was (carmalita from the I5 album).Does anyone know where I can get an that album ?
1,Exploitive and unscholarly,Sacred Journey by David Howard is an embarrassment. The author is completely uninformed about sadhus. His methods and approaches are questionable and disrespectful. The quality of writing is hopeless.
1,Good doctor. Really?,"The good doctor, Jack Cassell, of Mount Dora, Florida, put a sign on his office door, the reads, ""If you voted for Obama ... seek urologic care elsewhere. Changes to your health care begin right now, not in four years."" Orlando Sentinel, Apr 1,2010His specialty is urology and by the age of the population afflicted with urologic problem, I'm pretty sure the doctor receives a great percentage of his income from, wait for it, GOVERNMENT PAID Healthcare. That was a hypocritcal oath that he took."
1,"Hypocritic Oath, more like~","Dr. Cassell- you may be a fine Urologist, but you take loads of government money in the form of medicare and medicaid- that makes you, a hypocrite. Get over yourself."
4,Awesome Center,"I paired this with LSi7 bookshelf speakers and in-walls, and couldn't be more happy with the sound quality. Everybody is wow'ed with the sound. Strong and crisp which is what I have come to expect with Polk. My only minor complaint is that the center finish is only available piano black and the matching bookshelves are ebony wood. I would have like to see the center match as the ebony is much nicer looking."
5,PROVEN #1 Resource book on LIMOGES PORCELAIN,"LIVING WITH LIMOGES is the best resource book on antique Limoges porcelain; complete value and price guide, over 1000 colored photographs, complete descriptions and mark guide. LIVING WITH LIMOGES is a MUST for the Limoges collector!"
5,#1 LIVING WITH LIMOGES is a must for the Limoges collector!!,"LOVE: LIVING WITH LIMOGES! This fabulous book is a MUST for the collector or antique Limoges porcelain. Informative, interesting, entertaining, professional and beautiful photographs of over 1,000 antique pieces of LIMOGES. 2003/2004 updated VALUES. HIGHLY RECOMMEND: Living With Limoges"
5,LOVE - LIVING WITH LIMOGES by DuBay,"LIVING WITH LIMOGES is one of the best books available! The author's passion is evident and her knowledge unquestionable! I have read the book from cover to cover several times and I enjoy this beautiful book every time I look at it! I have met the author in her shop, Limoges Antiques Shop Andover, MA. Those with no knowledge of Limoges won't leave her shop without learning something, and those who know quite a bit about Limoges won't leave without learning more. AND HER BOOK TELLS IT ALL!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!"
3,Beautiful Pictures,"The reviews are what tilted my decision purchase this book. Looking back I think it's a little odd that everyone gave the book 5 stars? The book does have very nice pictures, however, I was hoping for more substantial information for learning about Limoges china and area which I thought the book was missing. If you are a designer and interested in setting up a display of Limoges china then this book would be very helpful."
5,Limoge Lovers Beware!,"Having purchased all three of Debby DuBay's Limoges books, one can only wonder how they could ever resist the lure of the hunt for these beautiful pieces of porcelain. Debby's books only whet the appetite for more! Each book has been informative and interesting. They are well written and keep the reader yearning to expand their knowledge of collecting and designing with Limoges. All three of her books rate a 5 star rating. I had an opportunity to meet Debby in her Andover, Mass. shop last summer and spent two hours with her being enriched with her passion and knowledge of Limoges porcelain."
5,"IF YOU LOVE LIMOGES, LIVING WITH LIMOGES IS A MUST READ!!","FABULOUS BOOK ON LIMOGES PORCELAIN!! Well written descriptions, values and information next to fabulous photographed pieces of LIMOGES!! A alphabetical marks section that is easy to read and helpful when trying to identify antique pieces of LIMOGES porcelain!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!! And I have them all!! LIVING WITH LIMOGES is well written, informative, interesting, enlightening and entertaining!! I LOVE LIVING WITH LIMOGES!!!"
5,A Book That Is Hard To Do Without,"This book is one of the few books I wouldn't want to be without. I'm not tree hugger so I was a bit wary of this book, but instead I found it to be dense with information, inspiration & ideas.I believe there is more to be learnt in this book about paganism than most of the ""learn paganism in a week"" books, and it has enhanced my divination with ogham no end.I don't think anyone would be able to use this book to identify the trees, so you still need a decent tree book to go with it. However, in content I have yet to find another one book that covers the physiology, folklore, healing uses, magical applications, physical uses & inspirational qualities of trees in such detail, and in such an easy to read style."
5,Essential reading,"As a member of the 101st who participated in the invasion of Normandy, George Koskimaki's insights are incredibly insightful--but George goes even further and collects first person accounts from dozens of participants in this crucial action. This is history by those who made it, and lived it. I agree with those who feel that a full understanding of the actions of the 101st cannot be realized without reading Koskimai's books!"
4,Rave review,"The album DJ Camilo Rocha is superlative. The atmosphere and the sound are similar to those of great statue, but the musical arrangements are better balanced, and allow the listener to better appreciate the beautiful voice of many great talented artists from South America. I hope this album will sell lots of copies, even if it's completely different from the bunch of stupid commercial rave styles that is invading the markets. Allow me to say that I suggest to listen this album to all the South Americans living in USA and those living in Mexico and Spain as well. This music is so nice that may help to conciliate the souls of the two communities and find out again the rich common cultural background."
4,Really really good,"I have consumed a world of music in my day, and I am on my third copy of this, as I give it away to friends, then find I have to possess a physical copy just in case.This is going to sound terribly generalized, but: this CD is techno-informed pop with some electric guitar, b-52ish female vocals, and ambient/cinematic breaks. But wait! This is not Aqua -- it all works together beautifully. And it all feels very intentional, rather than a bunch of styles shoehorned in to be commercial. Those who enjoy any of these genres will like this CD. Beautiful stuff.Very very well done, great writing, very entertaining, intelligent but not intellectual or arty. And above all else, it's definately ga-roo-vy. I'm listening to it now. Splurge a penny."
5,great forgotten gem,"I discovered this about 10 years ago at a going out of business sale, at a local music store. It is still one of my favorites. Great Electro-psych. i just wish they had done more. Here is a little trivia: The song ""Ibiza Bar"" is a Pink Floyd cover, which appeared on their album ""More"" (a soundtrack album). Their name comes from ""A Clock Work Orange"", It's how Alex refered to blood.The great thing is that with the price you can geat this for, It's well worth taking a chance on. And honestly it really is a great CD."
3,Too rough around the edges.,This CD reminds me of a late night campfire sing along and is a little too rough for my tastes. I bought it for one song that I had heard and liked. The rest won't be loaded on the Ipod.
5,Great lock,"I think this is a great lock. I am careful with the key (I read a few reviews where people said they had issues), and have not had any problems with it. The length is just right if you end up in situations where you don't have a proper rack to lock your bike to. This lock has worked around parking meters, poles, trees, benches - you name it, it manages to secure my bike without any problems (so far!). The lock comes with a really handy bracket to attach to your bike for when it's not in use - I was surprised/delighted to find this because I expected to have to carry the lock myself (even if you have to carry it yourself, it's quite lightweight so it's not a big deal anyway)."
4,Be sure to register your keys,"We've had two of these locks for a couple of years and have had no problems with them (or with theft). We live in Chicago (not France anymore) and ride in mostly working-class/middle-class neighborhoods. An important thing to do if you buy this lock is REGISTER YOUR KEYS with the manufacturer. It's easy and you can do it online. This not only makes the keys replaceable, it allows you to get extra keys (our locks came with only two keys each). Sadly, we didn't do this, and now we've managed to lose all the keys to one of them. I'm afraid this has turned the lock into an expensive meat tenderizer."
3,"fine lock, make sure you measure your bike","The lock is fine. It seems well made, and unlike the last lock I purchased, the key mechanism works well, although I was disappointed to see that the key is very lightweight (aluminum probably) and will eventually bend. Before you order, make sure you measure your bike. The 9"" loop barely fits between my wheel and the frame."
3,Good lock -- bad mounting,The lock itself seems fine (although the first 3-4 times it was really tight and hard to get on/off)...however I have given up on the mounting system. The directions are poor and the design even worse. The lock is pretty long and won't fit on my mid-sized bike frame even if the mount were able to be secured on the frame.
4,Much better than the OnGuard Bulldog Lock,"I have owned both an OnGuard bulldog u-lock and a this Kryptolock 2. I prefer this one because it is easier to secure to the bike (the OnGuard only accommodates a narrow range of frame-widths) and because of the rubber pads, which prevent it from rattling while riding. With the OnGuard lock, this proved a major annoyance."
1,horrible bracket,"horrible bracket, not usable, plastic strap broke while trying to insert, makes entire lock purchase frustrating, as now carrying the lock becomes an obstacle, this item should not even include an unusable bracket"
1,Overrated,"The lock is fine, though I don't like how the plastic sleeve around the keyhole moves so you have to make sure the hole aligns with the keyhole. What really frustrated me is the bracket. What in the world were they thinking was going through my mind as I was playing with it. Just try to remove the bracket by placing a screwdriver into the slot and lifting up per the instruction manual. Atrocious design on the bracket. Luckily, most of the time I ride with a backpack which is where this will go instead."
2,Frame mount NOT included.,"This is labeled wrong. The frame mount is NOT included, at least not on mine.Too much hassle to mail back, so I guess I'll live with it and never buy Kryptonite again!"
1,Lock will NOT open with Key,I bought this lock a few days ago and it was working fine. Then today I was about to lock my bike to a pole and it would not open. The key turns like it normally does and doesn't get stuck but the lock just does not open at all. I don't know if other people have had this problem. Maybe the inside is defective because even the backup key doesn't work either. What a waste of $40.00. Maybe it's just my lock but I'm only giving this product 1 star because even if Kryptonite ships me another one I have to worry about not being able to open the lock if I lock my bike to a pole. Thank god it wasn't locked to a pole at the time. Also like a few people mentioned this lock doesn't fit on most bike frames with the mount. It's too big so you'll have to carry it around in a backpack.
5,Excellent Lock,"Definitely a reliable lock. I have no worries about anyone cutting through this lock (seriously you need a LOT of force, it's very thick steel), but I'm more worried about how long it will taken for it to begin rusting. Rust has always kept my lock life to less than a year but this is my first Kryptonite product. Hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised this time."
2,"Lock is good, too bad there is no way to mount it.",The lock seems ok. Haven't had a chance to use it yet because I've spend the last hour trying to figure out how to mount it to my bike. The new bracket mechanism makes the lock stick out an extra inch or two more than my previous Kryptonite lock did. It's pretty much impossible to fit the lock mount inside of your frame if you also have a water bottle holder.I ended up using the bracket that came with my old bike lock to hold the kryptolok series 2. The new bracket design is ridiculous. Kryptonite obviously didn't do any product testing.There are no pictures on Kryptonite's website of this locked mounted on a bike and now I know why.I would highly recommend you not purchase this lock if you plan on using the bracket.
4,The Value of Persistence,"Rene Caillie was one of the great explorers and adventurers in European history. His journey to Timbuctoo is awe inspiring. It is a grand testament to the human spirit that he was able to overcome so many obstacles to achieve this staggering dream. This uneducated, unfinanced young man attained a goal unfullfilled by many a great explorer. Galbraith Welch does a fine job of retelling this amazing tale. I would have to state that I found some of her narrative condescending to the African natives and customs that Caillie encountered in his rounds. There is a trace of a sneer which was probably lacking in Caillie himself. This is a minor criticism, however. Welch was also a product of her own era. It does not diminish from a spectacular achievement. I was inspired by this story. The human spirit once more displays its glory. Obstacles can be overcome and goals can be attained. Overall, this is a valuable book to read."
3,It's a cute activity mat but...there are better ones out there,"when the ad described ""spinning butterflies"" i thought that this was an electonic mobile...but i was disappointed to find out that you have to manually spin the butterflies yourself. I wish there were more of a music variety, as it gets old fast to hear the same tunes over and over. Overall its an ""okay"" activity gym, though I'm glad that I only paid $43 use for it on Amazon...I really couldn't see myself paying $75 for something like this. I feel that there should have been more toy attachments as there are only 3 + the mirror, and there are tons more places to add toy attachments, but that means more money. I also agree with someone elses comment below, the giraffe holding the mirror, the mirror is facing the opposite direction so it would be quite a challenge for my (or any!) baby to actually be able to see themselves in it."
4,It is TOO cute!! :),"This item is very vibrant. It has lovely colours, was easy to put together and looks like it would be fun for a baby to play on. That being said, its kinda small! I was thinking it would be as big as a baby's blanket is, but its not. We think it will probably only be useful for the first 3 to 4 months because when s/he starts rolling over - one roll will send him/her off the mat! Oh - I haven't installed the batteries yet so I can't comment on the music or sound."
4,fun,I got this for my two month old son and he loves it. The lights are great and it keeps him busy. It is super cute and easy to put together. The only thing I would change is that I wish that the butterfly's moved around like a mobile.
4,Our baby loved this gym!,"My daughter adored her gym until she was about 6 months old and she started sitting. It's perfect for tummy time so baby's little face isn't mashing into the carpet. My daughter LOVED the giraffe - she would stare at it and grin and jabber to it non stop. It was so neat watching her go from just lying there to reaching up and batting her toys around. The monkey falls down after awhile but you can knot his tale to keep him up there. My daughter like to pull him down though. My only complaint is that it doesn't store well. Once you set it up, it's really easiest to just leave it up until you're ready to pack it up for the next baby or yard sale. It's not difficult to take down and put back up - just not convenient if you need to do it often, which we didn't."
1,One glitch ruins all pros,"The playmat would be perfect if music did not stop every 20 seconds. It says in the manual to restart it - does not help, baby starts crying. The only thing that helps is hitting the mat - but every 15-20 seconds?? VERY annoying."
1,"""spinning butterflies"" ??????????","The product overview says ""spinning butterflies"". The butterflies in my baby gym never spins, and when I checked other reviews many other claims that the butterflies never spin.So what does ""spinning butterflies"" means? Does that mean the baby spin the butterfly manually.I would have expected more music choices and spinning toys for such a price."
5,Fischer Price Rainforest Gym,This is the greatest baby entertainment system ever. I have purchased it for 2 different families and it has been the favorite baby gift for both. The music is soft and plays for a long time. The lights are mesmerizing. Fabulous entertainment for babies!
4,Play Gym,My daughter loves the animals and tactile parts that this gym comes with. It is good quality. The only downside to it is that in order to install the batteries you need to disassemble the whole gym.
5,fisher price rainforest melodies and lights deluxe gym,"El cliente cumplió con la entrega del producto a tiempo, por lo cual he quedado satisfecho para poder optar o tomar en cuenta para una próxima compra. gracias........"
4,launder with care,"As a play gym, it provides the entertainment expected for an infant. However -- I chose to launder the mat before letting my granddaughter play on it. I followed the instructions on the label to the rule, but the backing partially MELTED. I am able to sew additional backing on it, but my suggestion is -- DO NOT machine dry, despite the label."
4,great product.,"this is an amazing product. the only annoying thing is, you cannot disassemble it back to it's original packaging... this is really not nice..."
5,Great Buy!,"I was initially concerned about spending so much on a play mat, but it is worth every penny. My 3-month-old daughter loves the rain forest gym and stays absolutely entranced with the brilliant colors, flashing lights and butterflies. This has also helped encourage tummy-time, which she hadn't previously been too keen on. I like the extra loops on varying levels that allow me to attach more of her toys. The only thing that would improve this product would be to have the butterflies spin on their own."
3,mat is smaller than it appears,I was hoping this mat would be bigger than the other rainforest mat I recieved as a babyshower gift but this mat is not much bigger. My daughter loves it though. It keeps her occupied for a while and she loves al the different animals attached to it. But...I would love a little more room for her to roll around in other than that it's a good mat. It's a little pricey though for being so small!
3,"Eh, it's ok. Not worth the price.","Honest to goodness, I thought this thing was AMAZING when I got it, but my baby didn't....and really he's the one who counts. It's definitely cool with all of the toys hanging off of it, lights, and music, but my baby (who is completely developmentally normal by the way) actually cries when I put him under the arches to play with the toys and hear the music and all of that. You really just have to see what works for your baby. I'm saying this because I've seen this item become such a staple at baby showers...and really...it's not the best. You can get much more entertainment for a much better price with other baby toys. My baby does at least like the soft mat so it wasn't a total waste!"
5,great playmat,I bought this playmat before my baby was born. when she was a new born it seemred useless but after about two months I noticed she enjoyed the colors and as time went by she started to play with the toys.
5,Monkey in the Rainforest,Our grandchild loves the Rainforest. It keeps him happy for a long time. I really love the little Monkey with the curly tail that will hang anywhere you want it to.
5,Lots of fun,My first new grandson is totally capitvated by the lights and changing sounds. Even though he is not quite 2 months old it does hold his interest. I can't wait to see how he reacts in the coming months.
5,Entertains Baby,"My 3 month old daughter loves this play gym. I added a few extra different toys to the gym (a hanging mirror with monkey attached from this line). It entertains her for a really long time, at least 45 minutes at a time. We bought a used one from our local craigslist for much cheaper than the amazon price. Its not hard to clean the parts and we saved about [...]"
5,Amazing gym!!!,"Our baby loves this gym. She can reach most items with her hands while laying down on her back or belly. The animals, lights, music just keeps her amused and puts her to sleep. The gym was worth every dollar i paid. It's padded, its colorful, there's so much to see and do on there that it keeps her occupied, and give us time to relax and enjoy the moment."
4,A place to call her own,"We bought this for our BG when she was 3 months because she looked like she needed some more activity. At first she was overwhelmed by it but it eventually became a comfortable place that was her little world. The hooks are great because you can detach and rehang toys to keep things interesting. At 7 months we don't use the music much but we still put her in there and she is really fascinated now by all the toys. She recently learned that she could make the soft map flip over onto herself and ""hide"" from mom and dad (much to our amusement) by kicking really hard on one of the supports. Overall it is a fine product and a worthy investment."
5,"Fun, colorful and great price","My boy was playing with it since he was 3 month old. He loves it. And now he can hold the toys and loves the music. He is so excited when the music was on if his legs touched something (I couldn't finger it out what retouched to make the music plays). Sometimes, he can play by himself about 20 minutes so I can do lots of things without bothered. Life saving!"
3,I guess I'm happy if he's happy.,"My son is 5 months now and he's enjoyed the mat the whole time. I've never changed the batteries and the music stays on for quite a while, so there's no running over to reset it.He's rolling over and pulling at everything and stays on it for about 30 mins solid each time, which is nice.It really bothers me that the butterflies on top do not spin. They just sit there, blocking 1/2 of the blinking lights. He doesn't pay any mind to the little things sewn into the mat itself, just the things dangling. I did take off a few of the toys and added my own, which he likes. The parrot does nothing, and the monkey does nothing, but he likes the other parts.I guess I'm happy if he's happy, but I feel like there's probably a better choice out there."
3,Choking hazard,"I used this gym for my first child without incident, and he loved it. However, when my second son was 4 months old he gagged on one of the pieces. I laid him on his back to play and moments later heard him gagging. The blue spinning part of the parrot hanging toy was completely inside his mouth and he couldn't turn his head. Luckily nothing serious happened, but I wanted other parents to be aware of this potential problem. Fisher-Price is a very nice company to deal with. I sent the toy back and received a voucher."
4,My Son Loves It,"I wanted to have images from nature that would stimulate him, and he started using itat about 3 months. He really enjoys it, and it's been fascinating seeing how he has progressedfrom just staring at objects, to playing with them.I thought that the butterflies would rotate, and they do not. Also, there are more 'hooks' to put additional toys on, which I liked - although it comes with a number of them. took me a bit to figure out where the batteries went for the lights/sounds part - it's in the giraffe. (My Husband had taken it out of the box before I could read directions) Anyway, it's in the giraffe.The lights, when I lay under it, gave me a headache, but he likes them. I tend to not put themon that much, however I do put on the 'rain forrest' noises, and I think they are great. I like them more than the songs.The baby is very happy under it - I had another one that had farm animals and was a bit 'softer', and that one he could have cared less about."
4,Happy with this play mat,My daughter got a lot of use out of this play mat until about 6-7 months old. She loved it and was very entertained. It was also very easy to keep clean just throw it in washer and hang to dry.
5,Already a hit!,"My four month old just received this item as a Christmas gift, and she already loves it. There are so many things to look at, reach for, and listen to! I love that the toys come off so you can move them around or she can play with them in her hands. The sounds and songs are fun. It seems comfortable and a good size. She is very entertained by this mat!"
3,Cat loves it too!,"Overall, my biggest complaint is the quality of the toys hanging. The day I took it out of the wrapping, the mirror fell out of the plastic holder. I think the toys look cheap but as my infant has gotten older, he has come to enjoy the hanging animals more and more. I completely appreciate the fact that the mat is easily cleaned. I just can't justify spending $60 odd dollars on the mat. I am sure that other less expensive mats can captivate the interest of an infant. I can say for sure that for my son, the lights and music are not at all fascinating for him. He really is into the monkey, or anything with a happy face for that matter. I have started hanging other toys from the gym... which brings me to the other reason I like the mat is for all the loops to which to attach and hang items. I can give it a star for that, a star for the easy cleaning and a star for the fact that the cat loves it too!"
4,Baby Gym,"While the mother-to-be listed this as a nice to have, I believe she would now say it is a must have. Baby is safe and entertained and mom can sit at her desk and feel confident that all is well. Great addition to the baby's line at Amazon. Jill Bertolet"
4,Love this!!,My son is twelve weeks old and absolutely loves this! The only problem I would say is that the two pieces that go over the head don't snap together so if it is bumped into they can fall. Other than that great product!
4,fun time in the jungle,"my now 6mo son loooves this product. my sister bought it when he was around 2mo old, and he's been having fun ever since. he would lie there watching and trying to grab the toys and now that he's learning to sit i can sit him under the toys and he can touch and 'eat' the toys.he also love to play with the leaf and zebra tail. the mirror does face outwards and not inwards, but it's been useful when my son learns to roll on his tummy. he could stare at himself for a long time on his tummy.so far he's been learning to touch, roll, sit and now crawl under this gym set."
2,Circuit Board Went Out: Overpriced for what you get,The mat is cute and played nice music for a while until the circuit board went out. I would not purchase this mat again because it's not reliable and takes up a lot of space with no good breakdown options for storage.
4,Baby likes it.....,"... and thats what counts. At first she was a bit overwhelmed (3 months old), but you can remove many of the toys and then add them as needed. Also good for tummy time."
2,Circuit board stopped working after a month,My 2-month old twins seemed to really enjoy this playmat. They were able to hang out for a full 20-30 minutes and be entertained until the music/light part stopped working. I'm really annoyed that I need to buy a new one now. I will definitely try a different brand.
4,Great playmat,This playmat is really awesome.My 3 month old baby likes it very much..He likes to play with the hanging toys...But I found some of those are hards like elephant and parrot..If that was made up of soft material then this play mat would be more great.....
3,Not the best activity gym out there,"My baby's not here yet, so I can't comment on how well a baby likes this, but this gym is not nearly as nice as the gym we had with our last child (Tiny Love Gymini Deluxe). I was tempted to spend the extra money on Tiny Love again, but decided to give Fisher Price a try. My main complaints with this gym are the fact that it does not fold up for storage (without taking it apart that is and doesn't fit well in the plastic bag it comes in even when partially taken apart) and the fact that the mat is very thin. If you can afford it at all, I would recommend going with a Tiny Love instead, as they have nice thick mats and fold up easily into their bag for storage, which is very convenient!"
5,A must have,"My daughter absolutely adores her play mat. She likes the hanging toys and the music. I like the baby initiated music feature. She kicks the bar or pulls a toy and the music starts again, keeping her interested. There are plenty of attachments, so we have attached our own toys as well, and there is plenty of options for play time. The mat also has little tabs and a crinkle leaf to make tummy time more interesting. The only complaint I have is the mirror toy, which as another reviewer mentioned hangs in such a manner that baby can't really see herself in the mirror. Overall I am very happy with the toy, and it is definitely my daughter's favorite."
5,MUST HAVE!!!,"I just want to say this is quite possibly THE best purchase I have made for my son so far. We got it when he was not quite 2 months old (he's now 6 months), and he absolutely loves it! It keeps him entertained for long periods of time... sometimes I have to just go steal him back because he would stay there for hours if I let him. Great purchase!!!"
2,Missing Pieces,Disappointingly missing 2 of the 5 hanging toys. The 'baby activated' lights and sounds do not work. Overall a disappointing purchase.
3,"easy to install, but very cheap","""DISCLAIMER: I feel the need to add this disclaimer to my negative feedbacks, it seems like when a product reviewer rates a products at Amazon with negative feedback, many other users who happen to like the item gets upset and vote on that negative reviews as being not helpful..If you really think you disagree with the review, let it go, do not vote down reviews just because you like the item. Rate reviews based on its merit, not yours""REVIEW:Pros:-Very easy to put togetherCons:-Very cheaply made, I would value it no more than $25-Requires C batteries, who uses C batteries nowadays !-The melodies does not last more than a minute, and it has 4 songs on it.I would expect something of a more quality built item from Fisher-Price, I can imagine this thing being sold in China Town for $10 in Flushing NY.However, if this ever goes to sale for $24.95, it is a good option as a cheap Gym for the baby."
2,mat doesn't fully attach to bars,giraffe does not attach to mat and with one swift kick will come tumbling down on baby. also baby would have to have freakishly long arms in order to spin butterflies. will be returning
2,defective toy,It is not as great as mentioned in the product description. Besides the spinning butterflies don't spin at all.Apparently most of fisher price's products have some faulty. I bought the forest mobile and two screws were missing. I didn't send it back because it was too much of a hassle for two screws and I live out of USA.I wouldn't recommend any fisher price toy and I am not buying any again.
3,expected more,I really looked forward to this but the music doesn't always work. On high volume it stops and you need to move the polesFisher Price after all- supposed to be top of the line. No?
1,FOOLISHNESS,"This gym was absolute rubbish for my 3 months old baby. He got so bored within the next day it arrived. For the first 20 minutes he was laughing and reaching towards the things spinning over his head; to encourage him I put one of them in his hand and he was fine but then he started to get fussy. I took him out and gave him a break. In the evening I put him back on the mat, he looked at it for awhile, then he started to get fussy again; the next day the same thing. He love his music swing from fisher price, that's the only thing I have so far that keeps him quiet.Anywyas, all this gym does was play music with 4 little flickering lights. I expected the things over the lights to spin, it did not. I expected more for the price I paid for it. I would not recommend this item. This is foolishness, a rip off this thing is worth $10, that is my honest opinion; $10 or less."
2,Not sturdy,"I am disappointed with this product. I put it together and I have to say, it's not a sturdy gym. I worry that one good tug will send the entire thing crashing down. The pieces do ""click"" together and slide into the fabric slots but it has come apart when pressure was applied (by me) to test it. The fabric is nice but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Wonderful,"I can't say enough about this play matt; it's great quality. We got ours already used three years ago, my son loved it, now my daughter; it's been through 3 or 4 kids and it still looks like new. The toys are engaging and moveable the lights and butterflys are what makes it so great for younger babies and I love that it has a low setting for volume and 'nature sounds' for when you cant take anymore toy music and the shake option to save battery life."
5,fun!,"My son loves this playmat...it has great features, the music is fun and the lights keep a child well entertained...it easy to put together...easy to switch out batteries and fun for child in all different ways!"
3,good for the price,"this set is OK it has a lot of toys, in my opinion not all baby are the same and not all will like the same tastes but this gym has a variety of toys.the toys are good looking i really like the giraffe. i bought this for a present."
5,One of our daughter's daily highlights!,Our daughter absolutely loves this playmat! We started putting her under it when she was around a month old and each day it becomes more exciting for her (she's now 2.5 months old). What is really appreciated are the lights displayed at the top. I think she finds them more interesting than all the animals at the moment. Highly recommended! :)
3,Great toy but had defects,"It is a great playing space for infants, my little one loves it. However, it has a few shortcomings. First, we received it with a defect: on two out if three settings, the music just stops playing after a few seconds, you have to hit the bars to restart it, but it keeps doing that.So for us only one setting worked - it was ok since it plays the full musical sequence. The defect was annoying until we discovered that one setting actually works.The second shortcoming is that the birds/butterflies hanging from the top don't rotate. I don't know if they were meant to, and we have another defect or it was by design, but in either case it would be great if it did. Babies like moving things, and it could develop their eye movement and keep them entertained longer."
5,Great for US!!,Our little princess loves it!!! My wife can do all home work with the help of this great gym!!Cons:- Poor flashing lights and songs
3,it's Just Ok,"My 2 months old likes the rattles and the funny looking monkey very much. My biggest complaint is that the music frequently stops even though the batteries are not dead. If we give it a little push start, it starts going again for a while, and eventually stops again. It does this even with fresh batteries."
4,OK,My daughter likes this gym when playing on her back but could care less about it for tummy time. The lights and different hanging toys keep her entertained for a little while. The music gets annoying. It alternates between an upbeat baby song and nature sounds. It would be nice if there was more variety and if you could choose between nature sounds and music.
4,My Son LOVES this,Our son loves to watch the lights and hanging toys on this playmat. The only thing I would change would be to make the butterflies mechanical so they spin on their own.
2,Baby got her hand stuck!!!,"My daughter didn't really show interest in this until she was about 6 months old. It doesn't actually do anything except have flashing lights overhead. Now that she's older and actually big enough to manipulate some of the objects, she got her hand stuck in the parrot spinner, and she couldn't pull it back out! Thank God I was right there to wriggle it free, otherwise she might have really been hurt. I detached the parrot spinner, and now we just use it as a plain old mat for her to lay on.This mat just does not entertain her. It's not captivating, and it definitely wasn't worth the money for something so boring. I guess every baby is different!"
5,Definitely recommended for 2-6 months!,"I received this item as a baby present for my son. The Rainforest set offers a whole variety of things to stimulate a baby's sensory including light, sound, and touch. He became increasingly interested in this item when he was around 2.5 months old. The gym comes with detachable toys such as a rattler, a jingling parrot, a mirror, and plush toys. Very colorful, and hours of fun!"
5,Love this gym!,"I got this for my twins, they are 1 and they still love it. A lot of people have seen it and commented on how nice it is. I love that it can play music when they move and touch things. My twins found constant light and sound too much but they like the cause and effect of this toy and toys like it. I highly recommend this gym."
4,Perfect Entertainer,"My son loves this gym, the best part of this gym is that the sound and lights happen according tot he baby's movements. Not sure if my 3 month old realizes that there is music happening as he moves, but he absolutely loves hte lights and the bright colored animals. He has now started grabbing stuff, so the elephant rattle really amuses him. We also use it as a tummy time playmat."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this mat originally because of all the great reviews. However, my duaghter did not care for it as much ...and the arches easily fell down. I decided to buy the Tiny Love Mat and that was a success. Every baby is different and sometimes you just do not know what your little one will end up liking.I do have the rainforest jumperoo which she REAllY loves ...the bouncer she did not care for though."
3,More fun for adults than babies,"I payed $64 for this because I thought it was cute and could be lots of fun, but my son at 4 months of age thought otherwise. He found it terrifying for whatever reason. Maybe the flashing lights? This taught me a lesson that I should really look closely at things and not judge them by how fun I think they look to me."
2,Overwhelming,Our 3 month old found the gym a bit too overwhelming. He just did not like the gym at all. But he did enjoy playing with each of the toys individually when detached from the gym. Also sometimes babies hold up the rattle/toy and lets it drop...it may fall on their face and hurt them.
5,Great Product,"My 3.5 month old seems to like this better every day. We rarely use the lights and music since she is so entertained by looking at the objects, toys & mirror, and she just recently started holding and batting at them. As she learns to more purposefully hit them and understands that the noises are caused by her she'll find new things to like about it. As I think is the case for most babies her age, she doesn't normally spend more than 15-20 minutes in it at a time, but she goes in it once or twice a day. Although I was intially shocked at how much all ""gyms"" cost, I'm so glad we have one, and this one is great."
4,Would recommend,The Rainforest play mat is entertaining and my baby loves to watch the lights and listen to the music and chirping noises. The only issue is they have to be on their back for the lights I wish there was something that lit up on the bottom of the mat for tummy time.
4,Nice,My son didn't really show interest in this until she was about 8 months old.Now that he's older and actually big enough to manipulate some of the objects. It's not captivating but this mat just does not entertain him.
5,Nice mat with a great theme!,My sophia loves her tummy time mat! It really is great and has lots of neat things to look at. She will play up to an hour on it which is great for me!!
4,The one i ordered stoped working in about two weeks,"This product is wonderful, the music the colours the toys attached but the one i ordered from amazon stopped woking after using for about two weeks which was upsetting as this item was very expensive"
3,Keeps her busy for 15 minutes,"Our kid gets easily bored with stuff, so I don't really blame the product for that - it in fact does a good job of keeping her busy for about 15 minutes and then she starts to make every noise possible to get out of there. :)"
3,more aesthetic than anything else,"I got this second hand and it held up well to my friends 2 children and mine. It looks beautiful and matches in well with the rain forest theme that we selected. However my son got bored very easily as he couldn't reach the butterflies and when he got older there wasn't enough to keep him stimulated. There are better products out there, even better ones made by fisher price to keep your baby stimulated. my sister in law gave us one that had the Alpherbet on it so it was a fun mat as he got older the toys span by themselves and with the child's help and the toys were in a better position for a small baby. over all the product was good but i wouldn't buy it."
4,I wish the butterflies turned around!,"I like it, but I thought that the butterflies move around. That is the main reason that I bought it. I know my daughter would like it and it would keep her interested in it even more if it did. I had borrowed my nephews panda playmat which she loves cuz there is a mobile that moves around on the top which keeps her interested in it much longer and she even laughs. I wish they still made that. This is the best one that I found being sold on the market right now. I would give it a 5 star if it moved!"
4,Fantastic but eats the batteries!,"I absolutely love this Gym. We bought it for our 3 month old girl after realizing that she absolutely loves the characters in her rainforest mobile. This gym is no exception, she adores it! I do wish it had an on and off switch, specially when you have it on the motion setting. Overall, this is great as well as the rest of the items in the collection."
5,Baby's first taste of the outdoors.,"My new granddaughter lives in Alaska and the weather is not always the best. So I brought the Rainforest Gym for her and she loves it. My son told me that she plays with it all the time and has even fallen alsleep under the stars (lights) It's has wonderful colors and lots of things to keep a small baby reaching for, and grabbing on to."
3,"Nice, but......","The product description clearly states that, ""Two satin butterflies fly around above baby as colored lights pulse on and off while music plays"". It implies the butterflies spin on their own.But you would be extremly disappointed to find it otherwise - they don't. This comes out as a major shortfall after you assemble the Gym. How could the manufacturer expect few month old babies to spin the butterflies, especially in the position they are attached to the frame? Impractical.May be a tiny motor running over the baby's head is not a good idea.Other than that, with vibrant colors, impressive array of toys, a silky mat, and lovely music it is a very nice product."
2,BEWARE...INJURY HAZARD!!!,"Last month I would have given this product 5 stars because my son loves it, however we recently found out that the spinning parrot toy is quite dangerous. Now that my son's five months old he can reach the toys better. He was happily playing on the mat until I heard him screaming. Upon checking on him I saw his wrist stuck in this toy and it started turning purple. Thank goodness he let me know he was hurting otherwise who knows what damage could have resulted to his hand with decreased circulation."
5,One of our baby's favorites!,our baby loves this....she will lay on it for a long time entertained and happy--this was a MUST have for us!
5,Wonderful Product,"I recently purchased this for my 4 month old daughter. She absolutely loves it! She can get her tummy time in by reaching for the leaf in the corner, the zebra tail that is attached to the mat, or look at herself in the mirror. She also loves to lay on her back and kick either the toucan or the monkey that hangs, which are interchangeable with the other toys that came with it. The only thing is that I wished the butterflys turned in circles that hang above, but everything else is great!"
5,Just great!,"More than expected, this is high quality product, great for develop children's skills and very stimulating. Has a wonderful variety activities for the kids."
5,My son loves this!,I got this for my son when he was about 6 weeks old. He is now 6 months old and he still loves to lay under it and play with the toys. Since he can roll over he also loves to look at the picture on the bottom. We use this everyday and he never gets tired of it! Some days we don't even put the music on and he just play with the toys. I would totally reccomend this to anyone.
5,Awesome for babies,"We love this jungle gym & we have twin girls. At first they just lay underneath & looked at the toys but at 3 months they started to bat at the toys & play with them. A month later, on tummy time, they would grab at the pieces in the mat and at 6 months, they sat at opposite ends & played endlessly or would roll across the mat to reach the other side. Endless amounts of playtime & you can add your own toys so you can vary it each day. At 8 months, they still love this so out of all the many things we got them, this has lasted the longest & used multiple times a day. And, the mat is machine washable & after lots of washings, still looks brand new."
4,Very entertaining,"I got this for my 3 month old and she loves it. It can keep her entertained for about 20-30mins. I do wish there were more moving parts. The lights are fun for her, but it would be better if the butterflies and leaves also moved. It's a pretty pricey investment, but your baby will love it."
4,It was useful for about 4 months,"Our son is now 6 months old and has been using this for about 4 months. He still finds it entertaining and has enjoyed many hours playing in and around the gym. One of the issues we have now is that he is now strong enough to pull on the butterflies in the center and bring the whole gym down. Luckily he was not been hit by anything and found it quite humorous. I think if the outer post were designed a little better this would not happen. Ever since we first got it we noticed that if you move the gym by pulling on the center the post opposite of the giraffe would easily fall out. This has not been a real concern until now, and it may only be related to our gym. Overall I think it is a decent product for the price."
1,poor quality!!,I have been very disapointed with the Rainforest items but especially this one. It does not travel well nor is it able to be stored easily. My four month old was able to bend one of the arcs and he is not even that strong! I don't think the developers at Rainforest have kids...
1,Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,I have had this product for a whole 17 days. Bought it for my newborn grandson. Worked fine at first. Now the circuit board went out and it won't even turn on. No returning this item as I no longer have the receipt or the box that it came in! I suggest everyone spending their hard earned money on something more worth the while! Very disappointed to say the very least! $55-$60 tooooo much!
3,"Overpriced, Mobile does not spin by itself.","I rated this a 3 on the basis that it cost $70.00 and the misunderstanding that the mobile actually spun on it's own,I guess the baby is supposed to spin the butterfly's?? Very DISSAPOINTINGFisher Price! The music is nice though, my baby does like the naturesounds, he is 3 weeks old and it puts him right to sleep. I thoughtthere would be more to this gym for the price, it's not a large matand I don't see baby fitting on it for more than a few months before he is longer than it. Over all im thinking of returning it and getting my money back, It would be worth the money if the mobile actually spun by itself."
4,Jungle gym,"Keeps my baby's interest for quite awhile! I did read other comments and I have to agree that I wish the butterfly ""mobile"" actually moved! Other than that, I'm glad I purchased this!"
5,rainforest gym,"Great product, my son is 10 weeks old and enjoys looking at the various animals ""hanging around"", good music with two volume settings. I like how the animals can come off so he can hold them as well as look at them hanging."
4,Great Gym- VERY overpriced from seller,[...] The only thing I wish this gym had was a tummy support pillow like most of the bobby gyms have. [...]
4,fits 1 gallon jar,"This was what I was looking for, except that I wanted the base that fits a quart jar. The item description doesn't specify the size of the jar. But now that I've checked another site, the Miller 750 is meant to fit a 1 gallon jar. Otherwise this would be a great simple water base for baby chicks."
1,very basic,"Someone once said, I could write a better book with half a brain. I agree.... should have spent my money on a nice dinner"
3,Buying Real Estate Foreclosures,The book was a very good basic introduction to buying real estate through various foreclosure proceedings. I was looking for something a little more advanced. I would recommend this book for anyone who has not started in this business as a first guide to getting started. It is not for people who have been in this field and have a basic understanding of the process.
3,Ok f or a place to start,"Was very basic and general, but a good overall summary of the process. If your looking for more info than that I would suggest finding a more extensive book. Ended up w/ idiot's guide and now have much more of the info I needed."
1,Buying Real Estate Foreclosures,"Being a professional in the Real Estate field, my hopes for this book far outreached the reality of the book. The material covered is thin and unsupported at best. The Real Estate field must have been different in 1992 when the book was published in regards to bank owned and foreclosures at auction. This publication is for the absolute novice only. Those that demand something more comprehensive should look elsewhere."
2,Many defects,"The first thing I noticed on this mp3 player after I turn it on is that the screen was not centered. Very dificult to figure out how it works. Don't have a lock key and I got it accidentally turn off and on when I move. Finally, I returned this product to Amazon."
1,broken dreams,"the player worked fine for a week, then it stoped. never want one of these stuped things again. ruend my dream of watching the clouds roll by while listening to classics.they need to rename this product to the cheep broken dream machine."
1,Wouldn't work,"Music loaded fine, but the mode button was broken. Therefore, the player would not play. I had to send it back."
1,Not good,"The mp3 player played well for the first month, but then just refused to play. It just died, all of a sudden."
4,Well received.,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my preteen and teenage nieces. They enjoyed it very much. It must have been easy to use because they had both downloaded music from my computer and were listening to it the whole afternoon.
1,Does not transmit the signal well enough,"Bought this to extend my HotlInk system and it routed the signal way too slowly, and most of the time, not at all. This was with multiple components. Ended up changing my configuration so that the Hotlink system receiving wire came out of a different place that was short enough for the original cable to reach."
5,Meets my expectations,"Noticed the strong chlorine smell disappeared with the first shower after we installed our new Sunbeam filter head.I purchased this mostly to prevent my haircolor from fading, and so far it seems to have done its job."
2,Have to like the character to like the book,"I gave this book only two stars because I found myself disliking the main character so much that I didn't want to pick the book back up. If you can stand to ""listen"" (endlessly)to the problems of a woman who has a lot in her life but doesn't appreciate any of it, you may like the book. The writing is fair. If you can't stand whiners, you won't be able to stomach this book."
5,She made me happy!,"Thanks Lisa for writing such an uplifting book! It made me think, smile, wonder and ultimately realize how very glad I am to enjoy my strawberries!!"
5,A Fantastic Summer Read,"When I picked up ""Whatever Makes You Happy"" I was under the impression, from the cover and synopsis, that it was simply a juicy and fun read. But the amazing thing is that though it is enjoyable, it is also wise, poignant, and in its own way, unpredictable. I felt myself engaged with Sally's personal journey as well as the rest of her cast of characters. The plot in itself is simple, but the language and characters are something totally unique. I found myself very, very pleasantly surprised. Lisa Grunwald is able to combine a great read with a great work of literature, and that is astonishing. She inspires me and will inspire all her readers to discover whatever makes US happy."
2,This didn't make me happy,"- Its hard to be emphathetic towards a protagonist who's depressed and decides to have an affair when she already has a great husband, two healthy children and no financial worries.Two stars because the addition of the ""history of happiness"" (research for a book she is writing) was interesting."
5,One of the best intermediate to advanced texts for Spanish!,"Finally, a text that reviews vocabulary, grammar and structures within a cultural, historical and humanistic context! It is relevant, interesting and not too challenging. It teaches vocabulary in a way that captures the students' interest immediately. It also allows the professor lots of freedom to add activities, links, etc. I have ordered the workbook and plan to add those activities as well. I recommend the first half for one semester, the second half for a second semester."
5,Illustrations 1st class,The Franz Kline illustrations are first rate. Nicely written account of this famous abstract expressionist from the 40's and 50's.
4,Go Wireless,"I've been using the wireless headset for about a month now, and I am very pleased with it's performance. After initially syncing with the Xbox, powering up and connecting is as easy as pushing the button on the headset. Range has reportedly been an issue for some, but I have not had any problems. I can walk into my bedroom and still hear battlefield communication. The mute function is very convenient if you have to talk to someone sitting next to you and don't want your comrades in the game to hear you. About once a minute, you will get a beep to remind you that your mic is muted. The one complaint I have about this product is the weight. After about two hours of playing, my ear definatly knows there is something hanging off it. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is thinking about going to a truely wireless system."
5,No Problems,"I have had no problems with mine, no one that I have played with has had any background noise emitted from my mic, and the only times it disconnects from the console is when it is time to recharge. I've been using mine for about 2 months now, not one problem. True, the earloop is a bit odd, but it is no different from the over the ear headphones you buy at stores. The only downside is that everytime the console turns off it resets the battery gauge, just like you may notice with your wireless controller. Other than that, I love the headset, and if I ever needed a new one for whatever cause, I would spend the money again."
2,Also Disappointed,There are three problems with this headset. The first is the range. You the headset can barely transmit through 1 wall. So if you leave the room for a second expect the connection to drop. And everytime the you lose you connection you need to re add the thing to your xbox like a new controller. The range is about 1/4 that of the logitech headset for the original Xbox. Now that was a great headset. The second problem is the microphone it too sensative and the third is that this headset seems to broadcast a lot of feed back that I can't hear on my end but other games tell it is there. The fit was fine and the design is decent but the lack of range and other problems leave it with two stars in my mind. But microsoft has limited the licensing and this is the ONLY wireless headset available so I use it. I charge it every night and it lasts between 2-4 hours now depending on usage during the session after about a year of use.
2,Don't buy! Big waste.,The mic broke in 2 months audio and speak broke. Plus when it did work every so often the mic would disconect and I had to reconnect it which took around 2 minutes of wasted time
4,Best headset you can buy but still not perfect,I have tried all of the top headsets and this one is the best by far. It has pretty solid construction sound quality is good and the battery lasts pretty long. The problems it has are it hurts your ear after a few hours and it cant be charged while you use it so if it dies in the middle of a game you have to play with out a headset while it charges.
2,Very Flaky w/ Some Controllers,"These wireless headsets can have major issues with some of the wireless 360 controllers. If you have problems getting your wireless headset and wireless controller to sync onto the same port (ie. getting your headset to link up to the proper conroller), the problem is actually with your controller, not the headset.I had to go through several rounds of troubleshooting with Microsoft, three wireless controllers, and two headsets before I found a headset/controller combination that worked properlly.Once I got a working combo, the headset still produced a much poorer sound quality than the stock wired headset.I still find myself using the wired headset way more often then this wireless one. Sad."
4,Es bueno estar comunicado,"Good product, the sound is clear and the functionality is incredible and no problems interacting with other peopleThe only problem I had is that sometimes it does not connect to my desired controllerBut despite that its a very good communicator"
1,Terrible,"The Xbox 360 Wireless Headset communicator is a peice of garbage. Do not buy it. My headset died in a couple weeks and now I cannot get a refund. For anyone out there looking for headsets, stick with the 12 dollar ones that is supplied with your Xbox. I am extremely disapointed."
1,It blew up,"I just recieved the product today Saturday, August 13th (8/13/2011). I attempted to set it up and it kept cutting off. So I decided to charge the illustrious product and the battery blew up, while causing the headset to melt. Now it no longer works and I'm out $25.00...Xbox 360 Wireless Headset"
1,Wish I'd checked what other's had to say,"before I bought mine. Short and sweet, these seem to have a lot of problems--problems with some games, problems with some sound systems, and just dying. If I'd seen the number of people that brought theirs home to find it was DOA, then replaced it with another DOA I'd have kept looking. And based on people's complaints it also looks like MS refuses to repair them, although I found one person who said MS would fix it for a 40 dollar fee, plus he had to pay shipping. 75-80% of the purchase cost for a repair.Now this is all hearsay, but there's so much of it out there that I have to accept that this thing isn't worth it."
2,dead after two weeks,"I got the wireless headset wanting a little more freedom. But after two weeks it just died. I don't abuse my things and it didn't drop. Went to use it one day and i got nothing. Wont turn on, wont charge wont do anything. Now im back to the wired headset. Oh well."
2,Very Disappointing,"After waiting months for this to arrive I was very disappointed with this product. The earloop took a little getting used to but over all it did fit comfortably. I was a bit surprised at the size of this thing, its twice the size of most bluetooth headsets out on the market. I had no problems hearing my friends on XBOX Live, they came in loud and clear. It was also very easy to link the headset to the XBOX 360. The real problem comes in with the sensitivity of the microphone. The mike would pick up every little sound in the room which became very distracting to the other players. It would also start broadcasting feedback to the other players for no apparent reason. Once it started doing this the only thing you could do to stop it is to turn it off and on again. After having to do this 5 or 6 times in one evening I decided it was time to bring it back. Hopefully Microsoft will resolve this issue in future releases, until then its not worth the money or frustration."
1,Much worse than the original xbox logitech wireless headset,"i figured that microsoft would put a decent product on the market when it released this wireless headset for the xbox 360. unfortunately, the headset hasn't met ANY of my expectations. it is AWFUL, DO NOT PURCHASE!!! it continuously disconnects from the xbox, so u find yourself turning the power off and then back on so it reconnects. if you leave the room that the xbox is in, it loses connection (and either must turn off/on again, or wait a long time for it to reconnect). the technology in this headset is abominable. i bought this headset when it was $75. needless to say, i wouldn't pay $20 for it. i've since switched to the bulky and irritable, but consistent wired headset that comes with the xbox. thanks for a great product microsoft...NOT"
1,Do not buy this,"In a glance, this looks like a nice product. It's nicely designed, although it might be a little uncomfortable at first. You have to pull your ear though the little loop. The sound comes out nice and clear. The charger is nice, and the little LEDs are nice. Finally, i can go to the bathroom without having the lug the controller.HOWEVER, people in your game will complain getting feedback. It will sound like your voice is echoing to others. The worst part is, is that it will make everybody else's mic echo too.Problems from not syncing to feedback has been reported EXTENSIVELY on the official XBOX forums.DO NOT BUY THIS"
2,problems,i like the headset and the quality of the sound and convenience of the wireless part. but i've gone through 3 of them already apparently they just stop working they turn off and you can't turn them back on or charge them. I'm hoping that if enough people complain microsoft will resolve the problem because other than that i liked it i didn't even mind the random disconects.
2,Headset in Action,"I Highly DO NOT suggest buying this product. I actually bought it at Walmart and it's not great. For the price, I reccomend buying a Turtle Beach, but it has echo problems. The First time I bought the Microsoft headset it worked pretty good. But then in use is started having syncing problems, and would not work properly. It really just made me mad. The next few days I try'ed everything. I turned in on and off, let in charge for like 24 hours. Still nothing. It would NOT SYNC properly with my 360. As you know Microsoft has made some pretty bad products in the past, and this one of them. I actually lost my recipet, and I was really in some trouble. I had to have Walmart put in on a gift card, exchange with someone in my family and then go and buy it at Best Buy. This is really a piece of crap, and I do not reccomend buying it. Go and get yourself a Turtle Beach. You won't be dissapointed."
1,Pure garbage,"This headset is absolute garbage. I went through 3 of these before I was able to get my money back from Gamestop. No one can hear you, it cuts in and out, battery life really wasn't that great. This happened to all 3 headsets I bought. And while I was at Gamestop returning the last headset the guy behind the counter said this happens all the time. Save your money."
1,Constantly can't be heard,bought this item thinking I could get rid of my wired headset. NOT THE CASE.The mic only starts to work about half way through your statement. Very annoying and not functional. I would wait until another company brings their third party item. Do not waste you money on this.
2,An Unnecessary (and annoying) Luxury,"At first I thought it would be novel to play online without the hassle of wires, so I spent over $50 on this. It turned out to be more annoying than it was worth.It is heavy to support on your ear.It is annoying to recharge.It is difficult for your 360 to ""locate""Trust me, save the money and just use a headset like everyone else."
2,Workes good but breaks after a week,Xbox 360 Wireless HeadsetI bought this headset as a gift to my self for x mas and it worked great. However after about two weeks of good use it broke. It would not charge when i put it in the console or a computer and when i called microsoft to see if i could get a repair and they said that it would cost 29.99 so i just returned it to amazon insted. So this headset is verry cheap but sounds good
3,XBOX 360 Wireless Headset,"This was my second 360 Wireless Headset. I like the product, however it does have issues. When I walk out of range which seems to be about 15-20 ft sometimes my headset loses sync and I have to cycle power to get it back. Sometimes it does it while gaming and the voice chat starts coming over the TV. Then again I have to cycle power to get it to work. It only happens maybe once every 2-3 hours of use, just enough to be annoying. This product also does not work well in COD3 multiplayer. Not sure why but I get a lot of complaints about noise from my mic when I am not talking. I have to stay muted during COD3 multiplayer. Other than that it works well, I like the snug over the ear fit. It's secure does not slip. Great for folks who get a lot of interruptions while gaming. No more carrying the controller everywhere because of the wired headset..."
1,Almost Useless,"-The Good- The sound quality is good (both speaker & mic), and it was fairly comfortable for me, I often forgot that it was even on my ear.-The Bad- The range of it was very limited, maybe about 20 feet before it became unusable. Thats much less that half of what my controller & wired mic can go. Also it keeps cutting out randomly, The further away I get the more often it cuts out. This alone makes it almost useless for me since it switches between the tv speakers and the headset, it makes it very hard to hear what people are saying. It also keeps randomly beeping in my ear and I'm not sure why it keeps doing this."
4,Much better then the wire headset,"It works much better then the wired headset but the distance is short. Bit on the expensive side and it's hard to find the mute button. Also, it dis-connects you if it idle too long."
1,don't waste your money,this product sucks get alot of static through please do not waste your money ther are real good wired ones for 100 dollars
1,What's the Point?,"Seriously, the wired (much cheaper) version does NOT plug into your console, it plugs into your controller. I just wish I could understand what all you people who buy this are doing with it? I mean are you playing xbox live without having a controller in your hand? Are you chatting while someone else plays the game? Just doesn't make sense, who needs freedom from the controller. My guess is that people are buying this because they think the wired one plugs into your console."
2,not worth getting,"I actually thought it was nice to have the wireless headset so I don't have to deal with the wires. The problem with the headset is that it isn't as comfortable as the wired headset. When I have it on, it feels like it's about to fall off. I acutally have to hold on to the headset to talk. Sometimes I have to cup my hand near the mic, or you have to talk loud inorder for your voice to be transmitted.IMO if your just gonna be playing long hours of gaming w/ the headset, stick with the wired one, it's cheaper, more comfortable, and doesn't use additional battery."
2,Sketchy at Best,"The sound quality is great, and when the mic actually picks me up it works quite well as well. The problem comes in when I'm in a game with auto sound detection (like uno) where you just start talking and it filters out all the what it thinks is just noise, about 4/6 times I'll start talking and it wont turn on. Also, my battery life so far has been nothing close to the 8 hours it promises, coming in closer to 4. I bought this because I couldn't stand the headset that came with the 360 (I love the one that came with the Live on the original xbox) but I'm finding my self disappointed with this as well."
3,needs update,"Its a nice device, to me is confy, the only problem i found is that it contiously disconnects from xbox 360, and you have to turn it on again, and this happens infront of my tv, 2 meters away, also when i changed game lobbies in one same game, it also looses its conection and i have to reset the 360, when it worked it did it just as i espected, when they release the update its gonna rock."
4,good 4 star,"if your not a total geek playing hours a day then the charging is not a problem just charge it while at work/school and you'll be fine, if the other people online have a bad connection gets really laggy but besides that its good. lightweight easy to set up. only one thing, if you set it to be controller 1 then you play on controller two then it won't work and its hard to set it to 2, so when i play with my friends they sometimes want to have it but it won't work without turning off the 360 and its a pain sometimes"
5,Can't put a price on wireless.,If you play online you are killing yourself if you don't have this headset. If you have wired controllers might as well keep your stock headset. But if you are playing with a wireless controller you have to experience the freedom of setting down your controller to get a beer without having to take your headset off. Also good cause you can make pit stops to the bathroom or what not and still hear what is going on in the other room. Must have.
3,Playing and charging not possible at the same time,"It performs nice and sweet for almost 7 hours(6.30 exactly) however the downside is that (unlike the wireless control with the charging kit) you can not plug the AC power and keep playing, if you do it would turn off while charging.. that's the only reason why I've graded with 3 stars. Indeed sort of big.. guess it requires a bigger battery than cel phones blue tooth's. After all worth buying if (like me) you have had problems with the cord mic when it starts malfunctioning with false contacts."
2,A pain to deal with,"The sound quality is good, but it is about the same as the free headset that comes with the Xbox 360 premium. The good thing about it is that it has no wires, but that is about it. The first thing I noticed was that the earpiece seemed a little strange. It was not overly comfortable, but was tolerable. The main problem is that it keeps un-synching from my Xbox. When I looked in the instruction book, it says that this will interfere with wireless LANs. So, what's the point? If it will interfere with your wireless LAN, then is this just for people that have their Xbox wired directly? I used this headset for two hours and was disconnected 5 times to where I had to stop what I was doing and re-synch. I do not recommend this product at all. Mine is definitely going back to the store."
4,Good product.,"I guess it's obvious that this is not a must have for online gaming. But having said that it is a pretty neat product and mine worked flawlessly. The manual could be more through. The price is a bit steep, but amazon had the lowest I could find. Overall a good addition to your XBox 360."
4,wireless rocks,"I love the freedom of the wireless headset. I can walk around the house without loosing connection and don't have to carry the controller around with me. I haven't had the constant noise feedback issues other people describe. Only once people complained about feedback and I had to turn the headset off/on to correct the problem. Otherwise the sound is great. The fit is good for me, although I imagine that it may vary depending on size and shape of one's ear.I hear that some people like the mute reminder (it beeps every so often), but I find it annoying and wish I could turn it off, I don't think that is possible, though.All in all a great improvement over my wired headset."
3,"Good, but not quite","I purchased this to replace a wired headset that came with my Xbox 360. I thought that this would be perfect for me but it turned I was wrong. The device works practically enough suffers from constant feedback. When I play a game with I have to turn my TV way down so as not to annoy the other players(and sound like an a**). Also it only gives me a couple hours of usage time. When I was in a marathon COD4 Modern Warfare event, I had to stop chatting, go silent and recharge the headset 2 and a half hours in. Even when it is done recharging it is not advisable to take it off of the cable because the battery will still wear down when not in use. The earpiece feels kind of funky when you put it on the first time but you do get used to it and it becomes rather comfortable. Ultimately though, it isn't worth the higher price for this poorly thought out gadget."
1,Waste of money,Hard to hear other plays and they can't hear me. Only works with one of my two controllers. I now use the old headset that came with my 360.
2,Random Funtionality,Sometimes it worked othertimes i had problems. i tried xbox help and they did nothing. sometimes it worked but generally it was a pain in the .....
3,"Good idea, but still buggy","If you can get one that works, the headset is great, but I've had my share of problems with it. First, the battery seems to only last about an hour or two, far less than advertised, and just the other day it kept connecting to the wrong quadrant in the Xbox 360 sphere, and wouldn't acknowledge the 1st player one. And obviously, it's pretty expensive for a headset."
3,Not very mathematical... not very useful...,"This book is broad on its coverage, but it treats the matters mostly at the qualitative level. So it is perhaps good for technicians and newcomers to the high speed/high frequency field but it misses the quantitative analysis and discussion needed to perform design of products and engineering. For instance, high frequency models of devices (e.g. at Spice level) accounting for packaging effects (e.g. wire bonding, etc...) are not discussed or even presented. As such I think that this was a wrong acquisition for me."
5,Great for understanding the field !,"Only made it to 2nd chapter so far, but very informative in the understanding of the field for someone just beginning the world of high speed packaging with concise explanations."
5,Excellent,"A great discussion of evolution - the author takes us through the basics of evolution, and the arguments for and against it, and how this all might apply to computer viruses. Also has an interesting virus designed to emulate Darwinian evolution."
2,Overpriced,"Fiber is a really simple thing in reality. It's just non-digestible material that is fit for human consumption, and thus it doesn't need to be some sort of high end, designer product. This specific fiber feels exactly like that, I appreciate that as flavored fibers go, this is a better option than typical fiber supplements because this is an all natural product. However, I've since realized that I can get the same results from simply buying unflavored fiber in bulk and mixing it in orange juice, and thus Fiber Fusion turns into a major waste of money because all you're getting is some all natural flavoring. Do yourself a favor and just get the unflavored fiber and mix it in a juice of your preference."
2,Produces Bloating,"I used this product for many months with good results. However, I would become bloated shortly after taking it. I accepted the bloating as normal. However, my physician recommended another brand, and I no longer became bloated. I tried the new brand for 2 weeks with no bloating...and decided to give Fiber Fusion one more chance. Took it one time, again, and became bloated once more."
2,Spoiled brat wants what she can't have,"It was difficult for me to keep interested. It's written in first person, but I was unable to sympathize with the character whose voice told the story. As a piece of fiction, it failed to engage me, as I couldn't like any of the characters. As erotica, it teased and hinted and never qent quite far enough in description to em, help me along.The point of the story might just as well have been that the Narrator IS a spoiled brat, but it didn't help me like the plot or the characters, or ultimately, the book.I'm currently reading Stand and Deliver, and it unfortunately reminds me of the tempestuous-maiden/strong-silent warrior pairing that I despise in romance fiction. The erotica is a bit better than in many of the novels that got called ""bodice ripper"", though."
5,Fabulous Filth!,"I can see a trend with the reviews here. If you are from america, for god's sake dont buy this as no one over there seems to appreciate Ravenscrofts ingenious story telling. Perhaps it's a bit too naughty for our friends across the pond. If you are from the UK, I can definately tell you that apart from her last book 'Stand and Deliver' this is the best Black Lace book around. It's hard core without being too yukky, imaginative and certainly makes for erotic reading. Yes, the 'heroine' is a bit of a cow and the plot line is flimsy, but I personally find the plot is the last thing I am looking for in this type of book. BUY IT!"
3,Grungy,"Fairly good. Rather grungy and yucky. Quite a few gay and lesbian scenes, which one would not expect from the publisher's pitch."
4,These are the Episodes,"This DVD contains 3 previously released episodes: Welcome to LazyTown, Dr. Rottenstein, and Sports Day.This appears to be a repackaging effort by NCircle. These were originally issued on other multiple LazyTown DVD's offered by Nickleodeon several years ago.I took a chance on this DVD because I did not know what was going to be on it. My daughter likes it just the same. But, in the future, I would like to know exactly what episodes will be on each DVD before I pre-order again."
4,My 3 year old loves it.,"My husband and I are not huge Lazy Town fans, but our son likes it. He doesn't choose this DVD as often as I thought he would, but the product is at a good price point and he has gotten enough enjoyment out of it for it to rate four stars."
4,simple,it took about twenty minutes to install on my jeep.the plugs were correct and had no issues with the harness
3,Dificult to connect connectors,"First of all, the product works, it hooks into the existing brake line harness, and provides brake light and turn signals to the trailer, so on that note 5 stars.Installation is a little difficult to get the connectors hooked up, the rubber weather seal is a little too big, it required me to get channel locks out to squeeze the connector together. The factory connectors were definitely not this tight. But on the plus side, it should keep the moisture out."
4,Tone it down,"Great stuff for Giants fans, but it would have been much better if the music was toned down. Sometimes you can barely make out the broadcasters, who I prefer to hear over the dramatic music."
2,Ruined by horrible soundtrack / audio,"Soundtrack is lame, but much worse is fact that the audio level of the soundtrack is much louder than the narration, etc. to the point it's hard to hear what is being said. Would also prefer to hear much more of the SF Giants announcers, esp. the call of Renteria's 3-run homer in game 5 of the WS."
2,Major audio bummer on this 2010 World Series DVD,"I just purchased a copy of the 2010 World Series DVD and agree with some of the other reviews, the audio mix is really poor. The music is WAY too loud in the final mix and drowns out the audio commentary both from the narrator and the original TV/Radio broadcasts heard during the highlights. How did this get released to the public this way?!? Since there are no audio controls available on the DVD to adjust the music levels it makes the majority of the DVD very hard to watch and enjoy. (The extras don't suffer the heavy handed symphonic onslaught that the main content drowns under).What would otherwise be a great keepsake for this Giants fan is unwatchable and I'll be returning the DVD.I'm hoping that there are plans in the works to release an update that will fix this issue. I've also notified Shout Factory of the issue through their website customer service. Hopefully shaking that tree will get a fix in the works."
5,World series box set,I bought this box set consisting of eight DVDs just before Christmas. What a treat. Great job guys. Lots of fun for a Giants and baseball fan. It contains the entire World Series games spotlighting the San Francisco Giants and the Texas Rangers plus two of the games with the Phillies. And extra DVD was also included as a bonus (season features and parade). I recommend this box set to everyone and especially to collectors.
4,Almost but not quite,"I was really excited to have the games with the audio tracks of our local sportscasters. However, the two Phillies games still have the TBS/TNT/Fox broadcasters who are very EastCoast-centric and cannot pronounce the names of many Giants and do not have anything positive to say about the team.I know I should be happy with what I got but the local Comcast Sports Net TV station replayed the Phillies games with the local sportscasters and I really thought this DVD would have it also.Otherwise, it is a great momento of a wonderful post-season."
1,Unintelligible - I Threw it Away,"I'm not sure what else to say as the title says it all. I had read earlier reviews were folks said the narrative could hardly be heard and they were right. As a matter of fact it is quite the understatement. I was extremely disappointed; the sound was a cacophony of unintelligible mishmash. You could pick up a few words here and there but it was so utterly unenjoyable that I simply threw it in the garbage where it belongs. Caveat emptor has never been more true with this product. In all seriousness, do not waste your money, because that is exactly what you would be doing."
5,Go Giants!,"This collector's edition was a gift for our son, who told me it is excellent & brings back many, many exciting moments from Giants' games."
5,More info for the prospective buyer,"I'm writing this ""review"" before the DVDs have been released, but thought that prospective buyers might like to have a bit of additional information about them. For one thing, Amazon's price is about $5 lower than what MLB.com is asking, although Amazon's shipping charge may nullify that advantage. Also, according to the blurb on MLB.com's website, the DVDs apparently include pre-game and post-game interviews, as well as four audio channels (Fox Sports, Fox en Espanol, and flagship radio station play-by-play for BOTH teams). Can't ask for much more than all of this. Certainly a must for Giants fans and maybe Rangers fans too."
4,NLCS Games 4 & 6,"The Giants website (through MLB.com) also notes that this includes games 4 & 6 of the NLCS!See below:[...]The ultimate baseball collectible, this 8-disc set features all of the complete World Series Games versus the Rangers, as well as the NLCS Games 4 & 6 versus the Phillies and a special bonus disc.In addition to the full games presented on each World Series disc, pre-game and postgame interviews, and MLB Network coverage, and 4 audio channels (Fox Sports, Fox en Espanol, Flagship Radio Station Play-by-Play for BOTH teams) all enhance the viewer experience.A special bonus disc features 60 minutes of regular and postseason highlights, player interviews, and celebratory footage."
3,Blu-ray?,"Any word on if this will be released in blu-ray? Love the idea of it, but standard DVD? No Thanks"
4,Could be better but...,But it has 7 full games with KNBR broadcasters. Gives me what I wanted. Bonus highlights are without context which would have been nice so it is really just like going on MLB and watching clips.
2,"Great set, but glitch on Bonus DVD","I have ordered this DVD set twice now and both have a glitch on the Bonus Disc. Both times I noticed the same scratch in the same spot. I haven't been through each and every game to see if the other discs have similar issues, but since this happened twice, I am assuming it is a widespread problem with the bonus disc."
5,SF Giants World Series 2010 DVD,Thank you all for sharing your reviews. They served as the ice breaker for me in deciding to purchase this DVD collection.
3,"Video Good, Audio horrible.","I was pleased with most of the video editing though I wish it would have included a little more of the Atlanta and Philadelphia series highlights. You can barely hear the moderator because the audio engineer deemed the dramatic background music more important than the game experience, you must strain your ear to hear the moderator. The bonus game highlights are more enjoyable to me because there's no drama music. Also wish there was more highlights of the players speaking after the parade. They only used Cain's 5 second blurb. Overall its OK but not great."
2,WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"waste of time, thank goodness the book was given to me as part of DON training for a new corporation I had taken a job with."
2,Not what I wanted,"I own the Collins Italian dictionary and it is great. I love the phrases at the back and the lists in the front, and the small size is convenient for travel. I was hoping for the same in the Collins Gem Greek Dictionary.I did not realize that this format uses the Greek alphabet. So, in the English-Greek section, rather than having the word spelled phoenetically, showing pronunciation, it gives the translation in greek. If you don't know the Greek alphabet, this one isn't for you."
2,Greatest Mountain Climber...but Worst Writer,"I certainly believe he's the greatest mountain climber the world has ever seen, but he cannot write. Maybe it is better in the original German. I have no idea.I love to read. Reading is like breathing for me: effortless. Yet, it was torture to trudge my way page-by-page through this ponderous read of a book.Now it so happens I had a half-dozen mountaineering books by various authors sitting on my nightstand. I simply allowed those books to compete with each other for my reading attention: result is that Messner's books always collected dust. I TRIED again and again to get reading-momentum going on that book, but it is such drudgery to read Messner's books.I would always instead read something like Viesturs' ""K2: Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain""Ed Viesturs is a much better writer."
4,Sure its heavy - so is a Mercedes Benz,"Mine was not missing any parts, although the box looked like it had been damaged during a Customs inspection. This is a robust, well made stroller for two. I have a 35 pound toddler and a new born, and ALL the other strollers I examined were flimsy, too small or both. While its probably not worth the selling price, it is in a class by itself so the manufacturer can ask for top dollar. If you're a small woman or you own a compact car you might want to look at a different stroller. If you want a sturdy stroller for two that will last for years - well, you get what you pay for."
2,Enlightening Experience,"Seems that with these type bulbs, size matters. The more wattage you want, the larger the bulb. This one was so large that it wouldn't fit vertically in the socket I wanted to use it in. Very frustrating. I even specified I needed a ""small"" or ""miniature"" size, but that is not what I got. If you order this buld (advertized as ""Mini""), be sure it will fit in your intended socket. The base is standard, but vertical length varies with wattage."
1,"Bulbs arrived broken, bad packaging","the package arrived with bulbs broken inside. I called amazon and offered to return, and they asked me to discard the contents and gave me a refund. Both the manufacturer and amazon should have packaged these items better. Anyway, I went and bought the bulbs from the local store. Basically ended up wasting a week waiting for the bulbs. Overall, the only good thing to mention here is that amazon's customer service folks did a good job with the apology and refund."
3,CFL Bulbs - COOL WHITE,"After installing these cool white bulbs, I realized I don't care for the starkness of their illumination. They were also just a tad too long for several fixtures but that error is mine as the product dimensions given were accurate. I have relegated these bulbs to the closets and basement where they serve us well."
5,23-Watt Milli Compact Fluorescent Spiral Bulb,Great product. Really puts out the watts! Now I want to put them in all my lamps.
2,Fluorescent bulbs not desireable.,"The cool white is annoying - too much glare. Could never use these in my home, except in a closet or hall maybe. This is called a mini compact bulb, but it still won't fit in most fixtures. Every couple years, we try out this type of bulb and find they're lacking and expensive, as well as sometimes short-lived. We do have a couple of the warm white versions and they're more acceptable as far as the quality of light, although the brightness level is lower than the cool white."
4,do they have dark?,"This chocolate is too sinfully milky for me, I AM trying to gain weight, but it's such a bad habit. Down to my last five and put them in my freezer. I love them hard, but outta mind, as they say."
3,Not as good as I remembered,"Unfortunately, these were not as good as the hype I'd built up for them in my mind. They came packaged well, with packaging designed to keep them as cool as possible, but they just didn't taste as good as I remembered they did. They were a little melted when I got them (it was July after all), so I put them in the frige for a bit. They just didn't live up to my memories. They were good, just not great."
1,This book is terrible!!!!,"This book is so full of inaccurate observations of the German people as well as there society that it makes me sick. Over and over the author states how Germans have no sense of humor and how they are cold in there interactions with others in society. How inaccurate these statements are. Every German I have ever met is friendly, warm and fun loving! The author also talks about there way of living as if it was 1920. The only positive thing I got out of reading this book is phone numbers for government agencies, and conversions for Metric and Celsius. Don't read this book. Go to Germany instead and see how the German people are for real!"
1,NiMH Not,"The box has two stickers on it one with NiMH and the other with NiCd. On the battery, two stickers one ontop of the other both Nicd. I specificaly purchased these to replace my tired old NiCd with NiMH."
1,Not as pictured or advertised..... sent me NiCAD not NiMH...,Not as pictured or advertised..... sent me NiCAD not NiMH...I just sent them back... I'll keep you posted
4,Butterfly Rocks!,I heard the song Butterfly on the radio and was turned on enough to buy the CD. The rest of the songs are great too but Butterfly rocks!
4,"""Yin & Yang"" pretty much sums it up","A surf story that follows Andy Irons and Dave Rastovich through a surf season - contest surfing vs. free surfing. Great scenery, surf, music and narrative. Although this doesn't make it into my top favorites, it's definitely worth watching a couple of times.The film runs 96 minutes.Music by: Food Fighters, Coldplay, 1 Giant Leap, Powderfinger, Beautiful People, Salmonella Dub, The Living End, Seaman Dan, Scribe, Endorphin, Red Whyte, Rip Van Hippy, Gabrielle Roth & The Mirrors, D4, The Hard-ons, Morcheeba, Jack Johnson and more.Special Features:Director's Commentary with Andy & Rasta, Director's Cuts with Jukebox Feature, International Posters, Winning Surfshorts 2004 film"
5,A Beautiful and Moving Book,"I have enjoyed other books by David Appelbaum, but this one seems to be a summit. Filled with emotion and experience, it is one of his least overtly academic works; but it still exhibits the very intelligent reasoning his readers expect. Within two minutes of beginning the book, I knew I had acquired a precious jewel of literature.If this book were a typical example of the fruits of contemporary academic philosophy, I would hold great hope and respect for the field."
2,"DRI92ER4B highlighter, erasable,tank style, 4 colors",The yellow and pink worked.....you could highlight and then erase it.....but the green and blue did not work to erase.......I purchased them as treats for my tutoring students and we were somewhat disappointed that half the colors did not work!
5,2 year old in love with this car,I have a two year old granddaughter who helped build this car and she was so in awe of the work she got to help with. It is a fun kit to work with and any child regardless of age if a Mustanger would love to play with.
4,an unknown gem,"I have owned Tim for many years in VHS. I found it by accident and have never regretted following my impulse to buy it out of a bargin bin. It is not the best sound quality but the story is a heart catcher. In short, because I don't want to blow the movie, Tim is a ""slow"" young man whose parents are getting older and worry about his future. While working at a gardening job, Tim meets a woman who takes an interest in him. From there I leave it to the movie. It was filmed in Australia and I think anyone who likes Mel Gibson should see this movie. It really shows you a side of the actor that just isn't seen anymore. The part is played wonderfully and I promise those who cry at movies you will cry at least once with this one. The reason I gave it a four rating is because of the sound quality. I don't know if it has been improved in the DVD version, but I will soon find out. Give this movie a chance and I promise you won't regret it."
1,Pretty Boring,"This movie (what I watched of it) was pretty boring but I need to sit down when I'm alone and no interruptions to watch[[ASIN:B0000D8UC5 Tim], maybe then I can get into it and maybe enjoy it. But so far from what I saw,I just couldn't get into it but like I said, I kept getting interrupted. So I'll let ya know if I change my mind.It's definitely an older movie too.But that doesn't always matter to me."
2,"Over priced, and behind the times.","I have to write this review in order to save some poor sucker money.This flashlight is like a nice car with no engine. It is very well built, but on the inside it has nothing. 60 lumins is coming from one AAA cell these days, and for a quarter of the price! I am not here to plug any brands. Just do your research, and make an informed choice.You will be very glad you did!"
2,Not the quality you would expect,"I would not spend this much for a small flashlight, but I received the EL2 as a gift about 4 years ago. I have not used the light very much as attested by the fact that I have just now replaced the original batteries. Now it appears that the light switch is no longer working. One would think that the switch would last longer than 1 set of batteries. The switch is NOT covered by SureFire's lifetime warranty and the replacement is about $42. I can buy a lot of Maglites and AA batteries for the cost of the switch. I have Maglites that are over 20 years old and still working fine.Regarding the batteries: The EL2 uses C123A lithium units. These are expensive. I ordered 12 units for about $26, SureFire brand. Considering the extended power and long self-life of the C123A's, I'm not sure how this compares to $.50 AA's."
1,What a mess!,I was thrilled to see that I could get our favorite tartar sauce on-line--our local shop had stopped carrying it. Not so thrilled with the separated mess I received--looked a little like blue cheese dressing! Also not so thrilled that it could not be returned.
2,Pressed cardboard is not wood and paper is not paint!,Melissa and Doug products have cute art work and pictures. The paper glued on pressed cardboard is not lasting. In the big knob puzzles the screws are not always set in straight and the protruding screw will scratch the paper picture on the front of the puzzle as the child tries to replace the puzzle piece. The Jungle Friends (Safari) Jumbo Knob puzzle has cute people like versions of the animals as opposed to real life like pictures which I would prefer for the child to see and learn what the animal really looks like so limited educational value. Large knobs are good for little hands trying to grasp each piece. Purchased through Amazon.
2,Pieces stick,"I have several M&D puzzles. I bought this one for my 9 month old daughter. I was disappointed to find that two of the pieces are so difficult to pull out that even I have trouble getting them out. Hence, my daughter can't pull them out at all. This was a disappointment."
5,My Daughter Loves These Puzzles!,My 21 month old loves these Melissa & Doug puzzles and I love how they assist with her not only with her cognitive/motor skills but also with her speech and identifying different objects.
5,GREAT European style!,OVERALL a great CD. I would recommend it to ANYONE who likes any sort of Techno
2,Not what I expected,"The tape is supposed to be a guide for yoga beginners, not! Most of the stomach postures are very difficult for those just starting out. It is recommended that you watch the tape at least once before starting. I agree that this is beneficial as it will give you a heads up on what to expect. Modifications are given for some of the postures which helps you move through the exercises a little easier. As for the PM tape, the VHS that I received did not play so I am unable to provide any comments on it."
2,Not so much for beginners!,"I've never before done yoga, so bought these tapes as a true novice. The am tape was good but the pm tape not so much! The am tape moved slow enough for beginners to follow. The pm tape was a bit faster paced and more difficult - the positions etc were to advanced for a beginner with absolutely no yoga experience. Another gripe I have is that you buy the tapes, then they tell you that you have to also buy a strap, blocks and mat - it would have been nice to have found out about these requirements before hand. So to any other novices out there who are thinking about grabbing these tapes, go for the am tape, but give the pm tape a miss."
2,Not really for beginners,"When I popped this video in, I was excited to begin a yoga program. However, my excitement was squelched as I went through the video. I found that I needed some previous experience with yoga, which I didn't have. I made the assumption that ""Yoga for Beginners"" meant that those of us just beginning yoga would be able to follow along easily. I was wrong and it has turned out to be a primarily shelved video set."
3,"This is ""light"" yoga","Although I appreciate the brevity of the morning and evening sessions, I found this tape to be lacking the substance and challenge of other tapes in this series. Good for beginners, but for those who are more avidly practicing, choose another tape."
3,So So Yoga Video,"Sure the locations are beautiful, but isn't substance more important than style? This video had all the right production values and almost none of the right yoga values. Too short, too skimming the surface, and in general, just too little of everything to be of any value to anymore who wants to get the health and relaxation benefits of yoga (not to mention the well known ""yoga [buttox]""). But don't judge all of Yoga journal's video by this one. The pre-natal one with Shiva Rea is the BEST prenatal yoga video out (I reviewed ALL of them), and the weight loss with Suzanne Deason is well organized, challenging and supportive at any level."
4,"Finally, yoga tapes worth buying!","...I took a chance and ordered this set. I was not disapointed. First of all, it played (a big plus), and second, it was great (also an advantage!).As a very inflexible beginner I can actually follow these tapes, and I'm sure that they will still be of value to those beginners whose limbs are actually rubber bands masquerading as arms and legs.I could go on raving about the different aspects of these tapes, but all you really need to know is that my day goes better after doing the am tape, and I sleep better after the pm tape....buy it if you want to get started in a regular yoga practice..."
4,Perfect for the interested beginner,"I was looking for a way to relax after a busy schedule - an alternative to tossing and turning in bed. My body would be physically exhausted but my mind was overactive from the stresses of the day. The evening yoga practice was the perfect remedy. After my first session I can honestly say that I've never had a better night's sleep. This was the first video I bought from the Living Yoga series and it has not been my last. I am working with both the morning and evening programs, power yoga (also with Rodney Yee) and have subscribed to Yoga Journal. I recommend this to anyone who can spare 20 minutes of their day to find some peace, do some physical activity, and to center themselves mentally."
4,Great introduction for busy begginers,"I found this collection to be most beneficial. Anyone who has had minimal Yoga training will find these tapes to be worthwhile. They're short and concise. I found that the AM tape is wonderful to do just 20 minutes in the morning. I have a long car ride to work and found that this tape really invigorates and awakens my senses. The PM is a bit more advanced, but a beginner should do just fine. This is definitely not a sweat breaking tape, but awesome for flexiblity and relaxation. The sceneries used are breathtaking. Both Rodney and Patricia are great instructors with very pleasing voices. Try it as a perk up in the morning instead of coffee and for relaxation in the evening."
2,out of breath,"One of the reasons I find yoga so great is that with proper breathing it is relaxing while also being a workout. But I thought this tape went too fast, especially the am workout, and I was always trying to catch up and not getting proper breaths in during each pose. It's a good review of poses but once you know them turn the tape off and put on some good music."
3,The good & the bad,"I love the am portion of this video. For true Yoga beginners, this is a great, relaxing, stretching way to start your day. The positions are not complex and can easily be done 1st thing in the morning. The pm - can't do it, although I have tried and tried. It is much more strenuous and I think it would be helpful to have some knowledge of Yoga to attempt some of the positions- so not really beginner stuff at all. It would have been helpful to have more ""if you can't do this, try....."" put into this tape."
4,S-T-R-E-T-C-H,"Ahhhh. A few weeks ago a sore shin took me off the track and I decided it would be a great time to add a different element to my daily workout. I have since done these tapes DAILY and I feel GREAT. If you are looking for a stretching challenge, they are not appropriate. However, for a gentle stretching routine to ease out kinks, stress and soreness, these tapes are excellent. The tapes don't make you contort into a human pretzel and I think even the most inflexible body could benefit from the routines. As a runner, I've enjoyed taking the time to really focus on my body--what strengths and soreness I feel each day. The relatively short running time (approximately 20 minutes each) makes it easy to fit the routines into even a busy day. Although the tapes are labeled for morning and evening, they are certainly interchangeable (I did the AM tape last night and felt so relaxed I almost fell asleep on the floor!) and I have done them back to back for a longer routine. Enjoy!"
2,Real Sleeper,"I've been practicing Yoga for a couple of years now. Although this tape is pretty to watch, it is so incredibly boring it put me to sleep. The b.g. music sounds like it was boxed and remixed. It's fine for the (people) who don't know any better, but go to Steve Ross' class in Santa Monica and see how yoga will wake you up and make you feel alive rather than a zombie!"
2,Good the first week,Both videos were great for getting started but by the end of the first week I wanted something more. Think I could have rented the videos and gotten better value for money.
4,Terrific way to find time for yoga,"These tapes are both 20 minutes long and make it easy to find a time to do yoga during your busy day. I find the AM Yoga tape quite relaxing. It's also nice to get up in the morning to watch Rodney Yee in a Speedo doing yoga on Big Beach on Maui. The PM Yoga tape, with Patricia Walden in Death Valley, is more energizing. I find this odd for the end of the day (I'd rather be energized in the morning and relaxed in the evening). PM Yoga is also little bit more difficult. Beginners will need a yoga strap for both tapes, but you can easily substitute a long men's webbed belt. Both tapes are beautifully filmed and have wonderfully relaxing music. For the price and time involved, these tapes are a great place to start. They also make a great gift."
5,Fabulous,I couldn't have done it without this tape. I would never have gone to a yoga class but I look forward every morning to getting up and taking part in this relaxation technique. I would recommend it to anyone with a busy schedule and a beginner at yoga like myself.
3,Not for Beginners!,"I found this video lacking in any real instruction, although it's for ""beginners"". I have been using a yoga video by Richard Hittleman for years until I wore it out. I thought AM/PM would be a good substitute. I was quite disappointed."
2,I've had better,"These are very good tapes, but i also have one other yoga tape by another production company and enjoy it more. I felt that while the am yoga was a nice change, the pm yoga tape was not explained very well for a beginner tape. Some of the stretches that are preformed in the pm tape maybe difficult if you are new to stretching or yoga."
2,Review,AM/PM Yoga is good for stretching but not invigorating or energetic. It is relaxing and basic. The workout is comprised of simple stretches and that is it. This tape is FOR BEGINNERS.
3,Good for beginners and people with little time,"I found the morning tape an excellent way to start the day - short, and effective if done every day.I did want more though, and thought they would be longer."
2,Enough with the advertisements already,"When I am ready to begin my yoga routine, I get the room prepared, turn the tv on, turn the vcr on, and then I begin with meditation as the video starts. Unfortunately, the producers of these tapes have decided to load the beginning of these tapes with advertisements for just about everything under the sun. Each morning, I am faced with having to sit through or fast-forward through fifteen minutes of ads before I can begin. It feels like a movie with 20 previews before it starts. I've seen these videos everywhere, including a rack in the middle of a grocery store isle, and the marketing department certainly had more say on this tape than did the yoga instructors.Once the yoga begins, the workouts are decent. They certainly do what they claim: them AM Yoga gets you started and the PM Yoga cools you down."
2,Mr. Yee's inappropriate attire ruins this tape,"OK, I don't know any polite way to say this but Mr. Yee needs a larger bathing suit. I've lent this tape out to friends who were interested in trying out a yoga tape and all say the same thing...his bathing suit is just too teeny and tight. Beyond this distraction(with camera angles focusing on body parts that have nothing at all to do with learning yoga), there are better beginner tapes. I LOVE the YOGA ZONE Beginner set! Mr. Finger is an appropriately attired, non-threatening, mellow leader. Mr. Yee is just too....whatever (grump)."
3,"AM tape is good, but PM tape is not for beginners","As a beginner in yoga, I find that the AM tape is just what I need to get started doing things right. It is some very basic moves with instruction and a short program. The PM tape is not for beginners. It is simply a very advanced student going thru a very difficult routine and giving very little instruction."
3,Its good but needs more expaining.,"This is the first yoga tape that I have ever bought. If I had a little more experience, I would probably enjoy it more. It is a good video, I just do not feel as if it truely explains the how's and why's of the stretches."
3,Not exactly for the beginner,"This was my first try at yoga, I have always wanted to learn. Some of the positions used are a little above my level. And I often feel klutzy compared to the leaders."
3,easy intro to yoga,"I thought the ""am"" section of this video was boring and too easy, but the ""pm"" section was more interesting and worthwhile.Overall, I thought the exercises seemed very easy (I've never done yoga before). Be prepared for lenghty ads at beginning of video (kind of annoying). Overall, just kind of ""blah."""
4,am/pm yoga,"The AM is an excellent tape for beginner yoga and the scenery is in Hawaii,very relaxing. The PM is more strenuous,but I think overall it is an excellent form of stretching,especially before and after exercise. I have really enjoyed it."
2,Wonderful and Disappointing,"Rodney Yee is a master. He is a true professional as he keeps in mind his ""beginning"" audience in his overall approach, as he teaches the AM yoga. I don't understand what Patricia Walden or the producers were thinking considering her PM tape seems to advanced for a beginner. I didn't find all of her chattiness helping me relax, as she gave me a headache instead. Rodney is wonderful to start the day with and Patricia is disappointing to end the day with."
5,Easy to follow,This DVD was easy to follow. Rodney Yee takes it slow in these beginners routines. They give you some good stretching and relaxation.
4,Gentle Wake Up,"I have been doing yoga weekly in a class format for 4 months and own my own (off and on) for a few years. I recently purchased ""Power Strength Yoga for Beginners"" for my morning yoga practice and found it to be too abrupt of a way to start my day. I liked Rodney Yee, so I purchased the ""AM Yoga for Beginners"" video, which was just perfect! The gentle guided meditation and stretching really helps me begin my day with a peaceful sense of being. The music and setting are very calming.I DON'T recommend this video for someone who wants a ""workout"" or very involved yoga session. The most ""difficult"" positions include a single down dog, cobra pose and seated chair - all only held for only a few moments. I DO recommend this for someone who is looking for a ""gentle wake up"". I also recommend watching the tape once (that's how I found out that I would need a folded blanket and strap)."
4,AM wonderful/PM okay,"I am new to yoga and decided to pick this tape up and try it--the AM session I found to be wonderful. I made sure to watch the session without practicing first which I recommend if you are new to yoga (or anything, for that matter). I have done stretching exercises before with a strap, so that part wasn't a surprise for me. I found I liked the AM session best--it was a gentle and invigorating way to center my mind and body. The PM session was another story--I found it a too invigorating to do in the evening. I done the PM session in the afternoon and that seems to work better."
5,Simply great!,"A great concept. The format is two short (15-20 minutes) yoga routines, of which at least one is EXTREMELY easy to incorporate into my busy day. Add do-able poses, calming music, peaceful locations, and quiet instructions, and you have a great yoga video. I feel calmer after doing them, and my posture has improved. I'm definitely looking to buy more vidoes in this series."
1,Not Recommended for Beginners,"I have ordered this video by mail and waited impatiently to receive it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. As the scenery and music were extraordinary for both tapes, the poses done are definitely not for beginners. I think I will have to give the tapes away...because I don't think I will be watching them again. Can somebody recommend alternative tapes for beginners that are easier to do and do not demand such flexibililty for poses?"
1,Not for Beginners,"I just got this tape for Christmas since I wanted to start trying Yoga. This is not for beginners. They immediately launch into the workout without explaining any moves or the proper breathing. Before you can figure out what to do they are onto the next three moves. It was so frustrating I had to turn off the tape. Now I have many aerobic videos that I have done, so I can be a quick study. However, this tape is suppose to be for beginners and it is not geared for them."
3,Too much advertising,"While the yoga segments of these videos are excellent, the advertisements at the end leave a lot to be desired. After the p.m. segment, feeling totally relaxed, to face blaring advertisements results in dissatisfaction with the whole experiences."
3,A Good Intro for the Novice,"Very watchable, easy to follow, not an intimidating introduction to such a hugely popular art. The scenery is soothing, the music as well. I liked the fact that the instructor was not a typical ""barbie doll"" in spandex attempting to twist the daylights out of my body at dawn and then again before I retire to bed. The moves are gentle and user-friendly ! :-)"
2,The video was uninspiring after the first few uses.,I was disappointed in the am video. I had hoped to learn actual yoga positions and gain a better appreciation for yoga. Instead Rodney Yee rushes through a bunch of stretching exercises and you don't actually have much time to master any one position. Not only that the video begins and ends with commercial s for the company's other products.
2,disappointing,"I purchased these tapes after reading some very positive reviews here at amazon, and I encourage you to consider those as well. Whether or not you find these tapes useful will depend on your current level of fitness and also on what you want out of yoga. I personally am not interested in any of the spiritual/relaxation aspects, but I thought yoga may be a good way to improve my tone/flexibility. I am not in the best shape in the world but I do regularly exercise, 1-2 hours per day. There are 2 tapes, and each is about 15 minutes long. From the start, I thought these programs were far too easy. I stuck with it for 2 weeks but never felt any tangible benefits, and I have since quit. To me, it is definitely not worth getting up 15 minutes earlier in the morning. And in the afternoon, I found that it cut into my regular exercise time. If you are a person who regularly exercises or stretches, you may want to just stick with that, or find something more advanced."
1,Poorly designed as a teaching tool for beginners,"I found this video to be very poorly designed as a teaching tool for beginners. The pace is much too fast, there is no explanation of movements, and several of the exercises are too advanced. I was very disappointed, consider the purchase a waste of money, and would not recommend it."
4,A Good Yoga Workout,"These two-tape box set is really nice for those who want to do some yoga but don't have alot of time. The morning workout helps to lossen you up and get you going in the morning, but it is relatively easy for people who don't wake up well. The evening session is much more challenging and you will need some more time to do these exercises. But after I finish them, I go to sleep like a baby. I also wake up better in the morning. It was a little hard for me to get into the evening workout, the instructor does more complicated moves that do take a few trys before you can master them. Overall it is a very good yoga tape. I still believe that if you are a complete beginner you should take a class with a live instructor, however. This is a tape for a beginner who has had a couple of yoga classes."
3,Not really a beginner's video,"I am a beginner at yoga, and at the same time I believe that I am a fairly active person. I found this video package a bit advanced for the novice. Mr. Yee's presentation was well done, but I think he and Ms.Walden have it backwards. Mr. Yee's video should be used for the PM, and Ms. Walden's should be used for the AM. Notwithstanding, Ms. Walden is wonderfully capable, but she has you doing pretzel-like manuevers with unbelieveable head-stands --- a bit advanced for the beginner. So that my purchase is not a total waste of money, I am using Mr. Yee's presentation in the morning and the evening, as it is very restful and calming. I watch Ms. Walden's performance when I am feeling tired --- mind you, I don't try anything, I just watch. Some day (not soon), I hope to be good enough to try half of what she does...."
3,Why No Captions?,"Yeah, all the tapes in this series are pretty swell. But don't we want our teachers of awareness to include those of us with hearing loss, too? I've done yoga most of my adult life, so I can pretty much figure out what must be going on; meanwhile, a pretty big audience is still neglected. Give it a thought, okay?"
4,Great for anytime!,"I really enjoyed this tape with Rodney Yee. There were times when I wanted to hold the stretches a little longer but to keep the workout under 20 minutes it was fine. I highly recomend this tape for anytime not just in the ""a.m."""
5,"Thank you, Mr. Yee, Ms. Walden","I am a complete beginner in Yoga and this is the first Yoga video I ever purchased. It was worth every effort to get started.... I am under work-stress now but from the first day, I felt less tense,more centered, balanced, and calm. It helps me reduce fatigue in the end of the day, and helps me get started on a difficult day! I love these short twenty-minute sessions that create a flow in a day, (for that, Power yoga for beginners is also great in the mid-day) not too short, not too long. Instructions are so kind and easy to follow... I am an amateur dancer and it even helped me get one extra pirouette, because I am more balanced in mind and body!!"
5,Simply great!,"Both of the videos in this set are a welcome addition to my video library...ones which I will likely use each day. The settings are lovely and the yoga exercises are achievable --- challenging enough for a beginner like myself, yet do-able. Has made a difference in my flexibility in a short amount of time."
3,AM Yoga is excellent for a beginner. PM difficult.,"Being a novice to Yoga, I found Rodney Yee's video very inspiring and a pleasure to do morning or evening. Patricia Walden's video was difficult for a beginner, and not relaxing for an evening routine. Better to do this one in AM."
2,So once again here I am,"What can i say.....Well, I guess I was hoping for something different. These tapes are ok at best. If it wasn't for my little yoga training already I don't think I could have kept up. There are deffently better yoga tapes out there. I like ""back care yoga for beginners"" Give that one a try then come back to this one, it'll be much easyer. The A.M. section was a little to hard for me. After a few months I have gotten better. It's just not the tapes to get for a real beginner. There are better ones out there. It was cool.Big Truck"
2,"Good production values, not very deep","Although these tapes look beautiful and are relaxing, they are somewhat superficial. I watched them again after about a year of practicing on my own and in classes, and I found the pace to be distractingly fast. Sure, we're all busy etc. but yoga requires time and dedication. People who give fifteen minutes to their practice are only scratching the surface and would be astonished at what a difference holding and breathing into the poses would make in their daily lives. These tapes are pretty to look at, but they are very limited."
3,"am good, pm bad","first of all, rodney yee is an excellent yoga master... his instruction is necessary, easy to follow, and not intrusive... i enjoy his program very much...on the other hand, patricia walden's idea is totally different, and obtrusive... she blathers on incessantly - you may think a peaceful moment is at hand, but it is soon lost when she busts in with her monotonous and annoying voice... she shatters any feeling of serenity you may glean from her program... she gives too too much information - i am surprised she doesn't tell you when to blink... it is completely distracting, and frustrating... in both programs, the actual poses are easy to moderate, and do require a certain amount of expertise to accomplish... with mr yee's program, i do always feel refreshed, and better centered... i usually end up doing the am twice a day, and nixing the pm..."
2,These tapes are mostly spam,"The actual yoga part is very good for the AM tape. The PM yoga is OK, but involves way too much knee pressure. But the tapes have a long series of advertisements before getting to the yoga. This makes it difficult to rewind to the beginning of the yoga part. These tapes made me lose respect for the Yoga Journal/Living Arts people."
1,Living Yoga for Beginners Am/Pm,"The key word here is ""beginners""..Has anyone watched this video who never did yoga before and never stretched a muscle in these directions? This is definitely NOT A VIDEO FOR 'BEGINNERS'.After waiting sometime to get this video, I was g r e a t l y disappointed! Can anyone suggest a ""true"" video for someone JUST BEGINNING YOGA?"
4,Delivers What's Intended,"I found the am/pm yoga set to be just what I was looking for: easing into doing some yoga after getting the basics down in classes. I found that because I knew how important breathing is that I was able to take better advantage of the videos. For true beginners the part about watching before attempting to try is very important. The 15 minute length of the morning yoga is perfect because I don't have that much time yet it delivers the gentle stretching to relieve the ""stiffness from inactivity"" . I was surprised by the pm yoga - I was both relaxed and rejuvenated. I would never have believed that taking Advil and doing the pm yoga workout would help me regroup better than a nap after a stressful day when I'm required to be ""on"" for the evening. This stuff really works!"
2,Ok - if that's what you're looking for...,"This video introduces yoga on a very superficial level. Correct breathing and postures are not explained in any sort of detail. Nonetheless, the somewhat brief routine can help those not looking for the deeper benifits of yoga."
2,"Soothing, but not physically challenging",A good video for individuals who enjoy the mental benefits of yoga and would like a brief stretching session (~15 minutes) rather than the physical challenges the discipline can offer.
3,"Good tapes, but not what I'd hoped for...","I recently purchased AM/PM Yoga, but I have to say it was not what I'd hoped for. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but there are much better one's out there for instance, Yoga Zone: Beginner's Box Set is much better. I'm not convinced you can get a good yoga workout in 20 mins. flat. I found that the they rushed through the yoga position too quickly. You don't get enough time to breath and stretch. I only feel like I've gotten a good work with minimum 45 to 1 hour. If only they'd just slow down a bit..."
5,Everyone Should Try Yoga,Yoga has helped me in so many ways. This beginners set is very comprehensive. The routines are easy and enjoyable albiet effective. The feeling after your routine is very refreshing. Your body and your Spirit will thank you all day. The routines are perfect for everyone. The music is very fitting and the video is very well put together.
1,Not for the Beginner,"I wish I had known about video reviews before today. I am 60...I asked for the video for Christmas so I could start the new year off on a new level. Boy was I surprised. The tape speaks of poses I have never heard of and certainly cannot begin to do even with the aid of the so-called ""props"" which I invested in. Where does a beginner begin if not with a Yoga for Beginner's video? I fell for it hook, line and sinker when Oprah told me anyone could follow this one. Oops Oprah."
5,Enjoyable intro to Yoga,"Very good morning and evening sessions, especially for beginners. Excellent background scenery and music. It would be nicer if the tapes closed with a longer period of relaxation music instead of a commercial."
3,"AM great, PM not so good.","The AM portion of this video is great for a beginner like me. Even though he doesn't have to, Rodney Yee uses a strap during stretches. I found that doing this short tape enabled me to start my day with a clear mind and less anxiety. At the back end, Ms. Walden's PM workout was wrong for a person who's spent their whole day behind a desk. It left my back twitchy and uncomfortable (I recommend an abbreviated version of Ms. Walden's Yoga for Flexibility as a better end of the day routine)."
2,"Good yoga, too much advertising","I would like to recommend these tapes, but to end the P.M. session, when you are totally relaxed in shavasana, with blaring advertisements is quite absurd. So much for relaxation."
2,"Short on content,mostly an ad to sell yoga related mags,item","I was really disappointed. The yoga sessions are very short, both the am and pm. Each session is begun with lots of ads for a yoga magazine. Then later there is related pitches for yoga equipement. To have paid for such short sessions really felt like a rip off."
3,Distracting & for moderate beginners,"Hi everyone. I ordered this set and could not even watch the whole first video. The man wears skin tight shorts, and, call me silly, but I found it very distracting, lol. I tried the woman's video and found her moves to be somewhat complicated for beginners. For beginners, I recommend ""Living Yoga; Stress Relief."" These two tapes (AM & PM) are better if you have more practice."
3,Replaced 4 songs with 1 in this English Version.,"Even though this is the English version from the UK, they have removed 3 remix versions of Mann Gegen Mann (and 1 of Ich Will) and replaced them with a single remix of Rosenrot. Deffiently a rip off even though I love both of the songs."
2,Wish I could hear him,"These are all lovely speeches -- as far as I can tell. I bought the CD because I love listening to Tony Benn. And I understood, when I bought it, that these were his speeches remixed with music. But even so, I wasn't warned of two things. First of all, the music stinks. I like techno. I like soft techno, I listen to a lot of ambient and chillout music. But even by ambient standards, this is really, really repetitive music. And secondly, it's also really, really loud music; at least a third of the time, maybe half, I could barely make out what he was saying under the thundering blast of elevator music. If the speeches had been remixed with better music, and at half the volume relative to the speaker, I could have given this 5 stars. As it is, I found it completely unlistenable."
1,Look Elsewhere!,"Despite being labelled 20 x 25 x 4 filters, they are smaller than that. As a result, they don't fit tightly into the air handling unit. This defeats the whole purpose of having a micro allergen filter since air spills around the outside of the filter. I recommend looking for a different filter brand."
2,Book Evaluation,"After studing the book, alot of the questions that were asked in my actual NCCER test were not even coversd in the book I bought!"
5,Inglehoffer HM rocks!,"I love this on my chicken tenders. It is tangy and mustardy. It's not as sweet as most commercial honey mustards like Heinz, but it complements crunchy fried chicken oh so well. Personally I like it better because it isn't so sweet.I like most Inglehoffer products. The only thing I would ask them to change is to lose the the high fructose corn sugar. The HFCS is probably used to give the product a smoother mouth feel, but I could do without that."
5,most comforting book I ever read,the author used anecdotes to portray the loving ways of God in our lives behind the scenes--even while we're sleeping. it was the most comforting book I have ever read.
4,persil,"Excellent product. We use a Miele washer, which does not provide for the use of bleach. This product washes white garments absolutely snowy white without any bleach. I am allergic to detergent, however with this product I have no problems what so every."
2,"Adding perfume, Persil trades oxygen bleach for oxymoron.","It appears the mfr. may have changed the formula recently to add fragrance, and, well, that stinks. I've been using Persil Sensitiv Megaperls for a year. In the past I bought them locally from a low-volume appliance dealer (who I suspect had a lot of old stock on hand)...they came in plastic packaging and had no odor whatsoever. My latest purchase arrived in cardboard boxes (with German writing) and is very noticeably scented.Now, granted, one person's ""mild scent"" is the next man's ""overpowering miasma of doom""--for me, unfortunately, the new stuff is so bad that I can't use it (gives me migraines). It won't bother most, but since this is supposed to be an explicitly hypoallergenic version of the product, I can't fathom why they found it neccesary to add perfume. Very disappointing; I'll have to find another HE detergent for the Miele."
2,False Advertising. Beware. Very strong scent.,"The company says that this is formulated for people ""with sensitive skin and allergies"", hence the name ""sensitive"". While some may like the flowery fragrance initially, it soon becomes over-powering, rivaling that of much less expensive American commercial products like Tide with Fabreze. Even if one does not have allergies, the new Persil scent soon becomes over-powering to the point of causing everything in the room to smell like the chemical they added. Why on earth they call it ""sensitive"" is beyond me; I mean a little tiny bit of fragrance might be okay, especially if it was from a none-chemical source, but this detergent is about as sensitive as a sledgehammer. Buyer beware!!!"
3,Dark stories of growing up Jewish.,"Most of the stories were very sad and depressing. I do not feel it fully represented what it meant to be a girl growing up in a Jewish household. There was none of the love and warmth that I and many of my friends remember. Of course it was difficult to be an adolescent, but that is the experience of all young people. I just do not feel the stories really represented what the book let me to believe."
3,Speedo Euphoria Super Proback,"This product fit great and looked great new; however, I would not purchase it in purple again as it appears the red dye does not hold up. It is used for swim practice 4 days a week and rinsed in cold water immediately after each use as directed; however, after just a few weeks it has faded drastically and is no longer attractive. The suit itself still fits great; therefore, I would be interested in trying it in a different color such as blue or green."
4,Good book for engaging your company to use RUP,"Introducing or enhancing the methodologies and processes for managing software development projects, introduces a certain amount of Change in the organization. Change is inevitable, yet Change is always faced with some level of resistance.Depending on your corporate culture and environment, this book can help create a strategy road-map for successfully introducing the RUP process across the project or a larger team. While the book focuses on the RUP methodology, principles can easily be applied for PMBOK or other Project Management processes. It is a good book for planning, executing and managing the Change caused by adopting new software development processes, tools, techniques and templates.From my experience, the adoption stages are: Awareness, Understanding, Buy-in and lastly, Engagement."
4,"If you like weird horror, this is for you","T. M. Wright is a writer unlike any I have experienced before. I have read a few of his books and I must say that he is definitely different. His stories often seem to involve children who are born in the woods and of the Earth itself, though there is never an explanation as to why the Earth spawns such children. They demand human sacrifice. There is also no explanation of why they desire this. Which makes Wright's horror all the more seductive. All in all, I must say, this is a quick, entertaining read that will leave you wondering what exactly was living in those woods. I also recommend ""Strange Seed"", because it seems to follow the same pattern. I don't know if ""Nursery Tale"" is a sequel, it has been too many years since I read ""Strange Seed,"" but it seems to be along the same lines. Anyone who likes horror that is not strictly mainstream will enjoy this book."
3,slow shipping,I ordered this product on Oct 2nd and it took nearly 2 full weeks to arrive. Shipping was much quicker on the hitch and ball I ordered the same day. Have not yet had the opportunity to test the device so I am not really sure it even works. The instructions were reasonably clear and it was not difficult to install though there were no instructions for connecting the additional harness.
1,Amateur Writing at its finest,You would think that a book of this nature that one author would suffice however Prima credited no less than four authors expertise on the RtCW game.I found the writing to be extremely childish however for my purposes the content sufficed. The guide does exactly what it is expected to do which is to walk the novice Wolfensteiner through the pc platform version of the game. ... Save your money and check the net instead for further reference....
2,"It's okay, but...","I have to agree with ceres r that this book is hardly worth the money. The writing, like in many strategy guides, is very poor, but it does get the job done. However, I find it hard to believe that anyone would need help with the single-player in the first place. The best part about wold is the multi-play, and this is where hte book really comes up short.I would reccomend searching the net for walkthroughs and tips. Save your money for something more useful, like the upcoming expansion for wolfenstein: Enemy Territory!"
4,Definitely worth a listen,"I agree that The Beyond were a great ""could have been"" band. I was the metal music director at my college radio station in the early/mid nineties and I played this album to death. ""Lead the Blind"" was a top track for a long time. For the progressive metal fan, there is a ton to listen to. As mentioned by some other reviews, their weakness was that the vocals were never to the level of the other instrumentation. Too bad too. They had amazing potential and now it seems they are all but forgotten."
2,I just couldn't get into this one.....,"I did not enjoy this one! I like Dickens, but this one is BORING! Maybe it gets better, but I'll never know!"
4,A Good Read...,"Written for the middle school child, Monster Road is a great book that will take your child on an adventure like no other. The story of Kevin, who while spending time with his uncle, accidentally wakes the living dead next door. As they attempt to flee, they find the road blocked by monsters, will they escape? A well written title that also includes some images to help foster the story and your child's imagination; this book is only 132 pages in medium font and can be finished by a middle schooler in about an hour or so. This book is a great addition to a middle school teachers reading library."
5,Voyage on the Great Titanic,"This is an Awesome book,my second time reading it.It's a great story,and not to hard to read,so if a yonger kid wants to read it they probably could without any trouble,but it's more of a book for teen's like my self.This book is my favorite."
4,Great Book,My aunt gave me thjs book for my birthday an it i on of the best books i have ever read. i hav read this book 7 times and counting.
5,Looking forward to more,Gave this to my 11 year old daughter to read. She finished it in one day. She enjoyed the diary format and found it very interesting to read about the Titanic from the girl's viewpoint. I am looking forward to getting her more in this series. It makes a very nice educational/entertainment combo.
3,It was good,It was a good book in my opininon there was a little to the much information and it made it harder to be interested in the book.
2,Anticlimactic.,"A very good Juvenile book. English vernacular made it sometimes hard to understand the dialect. Character development good. Problem was it took too long to get to why anyone would read this- the actual disaster. Then once there, it was written about briefly and then the book was over. In other words, the build up to the climax was too long. 2 Stars out of 5."
4,Very good historical fiction for kids,"This book follows a fictional character through the sinking of the Titanic - giving the young reader a sense of what life was like in that era and a slight glimpse of what those who survived the diaster must have gone through. Overall, I found the book quite good; easy to read, not too much vocabulary from the era that wasn't understandable from context, not too much cultural context either. I did wish the chapters dealing with the sinking of the Titanic and the emotional state of the survivors were a little stronger but I can understand that (1) this is a book for young readers and (2) it is supposed to be a book written by a young girl who might very well be imagined as not wanting to dwell on or relive the events when writing in her journal. Overall, a good introduction to life in a different era and to an historical event."
4,Great Historical Fiction Books,"My daughter has borrowed several of these kinds of books from the library and really loves them. This book is no different. It's written in journal format (It's the Diary of Margaret Ann Brady) and is a story about a girl, Margaret Ann Brady who becomes a passenger on the Titanic. This story was written to be entertaining, exciting, and with a historical viewpoint. Although it is fiction, you really get a glimpse of what it must have been like to be on the Titanic. This was written from the experience of a working class girl who gets to experience an upper class trip than ends most tragically. I appreciated the true events listed in the back of the book about the Titanic as well as pictures and news clipping photos. After having read this book, I'm certainly going to pass it on to my daughters to read."
4,Realistic Account with Interesting Historical Notes and Pictures,"When I was about 10 years old this would've been the perfect book for me. I loved history and stories of protagonists like Polly Anna and The Little Princess who are similar to the working-class little girl sailing First Class on the Titanic.The book covers the daily life of a trans-Atlantic crossing on the Titanic at that time, but seems fully focused on getting to the sinking in the second half of the book.I don't think this book is appropriate for young children as the author writes frankly about the deaths to come, but for Grade 4 and up, it's fine.The best part of the book is at the back under the Historical Note section with a number of photos, paintings and documents from the Titanic with interesting facts--for those with a fascination of this historical event."
2,didn't have the energy to really concentrate on this book,This book provides lots of info on setting up a wireless network but I found that I simply wasn't able to follow it very easily and thus didn't get much use from it. Lots of technical info and descriptions
4,Wirless made easier,Book is a great guide for the novice when it comes to installing a wireless network
5,Sharpen your eye for art-- and have fun doing it!,"This is a wonderful book for art buffs and and novices alike. As Hoving says in the introduction, it's based off of a game that curators often played together at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Each identification ""challenge"" comes with a brief biography of the artist and unusual fact/perspective on the piece or its depiction, and the book's unique format helps me remember (and want to share) everything I learn. It's great for dinner parties, long car-rides, or just curling up with on your own to sharpen your eye for art. It makes the perfect gift-- I'd recommend it to anyone!"
4,Become a master of pieces...,"The curator's game of trying to recognize which painting objects come from is fun for young and old. This book might be too simplistic for an advanced lover of art, but I think that is partly the intention of the author- so that the book could be enjoyed by the 'everyman', not just the expert. Great way to introduce art to children 5-12,they love trying to find the objects in the provided paintings."
3,OK BOOK,"It's OK. I wouldn't buy the book again but art is an interest of mine and the book was OK. Not my all time favorite. I expected more information on the paintings and not as much ""puzzle book."""
4,Rachael Ray,"A friend of mine has this book, she is a school teacher. I figured that since I don't know how to cook, I could learn from this book... I didn't but it was a cool book.."
2,Cooking Rocks! Rachael Ray 30-Minute Meals for Kids,"I was excited when I read the reviews. But very disappointment with this cookbook. No good visuals for children, which would make it easily for younger children to chose a receipe and be excited about creating it. Also my children don't do veggies with the exception of corn. As much as I would like them to eat it. So that's not a realistic expectation that my children would eat them."
3,Not what i thought it would be,I normally love Rachael Ray cookbooks i own almost all of hers i think i'm missing 3 or 4 and so when i picked up this copy i was really excited because i have a two year old that is a picky eater i thought for sure there would be some great recipes in this. Well there are great recipes she has mainly geared them towards teens and adolesents and grown-ups which when i think of kinds is like 12 and under so i was expecting things i could make with my two year old and so on and so fourth. Not that the recipes are bad its just not what i thought it would be since her other works were so great.
4,Grandaughter's Birthday,I ordered this for my granddaughter and she received it promptly and loves it.
2,No Photos of the Dishes! :(,"So disappointed, I was so excited to see a Rachel Ray cookbook for kids. I ordered it for my 8 year old niece and ended up returning it and getting something else. Although the book is full of great tips, lessons and basics, there are no photos of the dishes. To me this is what makes a great cook book and for kids they need that visual image to get them going in the right direction. Even as an adult looking through this book, it didn't catch my interest. Sorry, Rachel!"
3,cooking rocks,"while there were some really cook recipes easy for a child to make, others were not so simple. This book was a present for my 9 yr. old niece who loves to help her mom bake. Some of the recipes require alot of parental assistance. I also don't believe this recipes are all 30 vminute meals"
1,"NOT WORTH THE MONEY, YUCK!","I love Rachael Ray. I love her enthusiasm, her moxie, just her good 'ole zest for life. She is fun to watch and gets you really involved in the meal at the same time urging you to try new things.She should not have published this cookbook.The ideals in it are nice. Cook with your kids, teaching, learning etc. etc. Create some wholesome family time etc. etc. ABSOLUTELY.Great ideas, great concepts.HORRIBLE RECIPES.Seriously, just plain bad.I am an uneducated semi-gourmet cook. Meaning, I am an excellent cook, everyone has always loved my food and I can cook just about anything under the sun (with or without recipes), BUT, I have not been to culinary school.Even so, these are terrible recipes!!!!!They not only taste terrible, they don't make alot of culinary sense.I am not bashing Rachael. Just this cookbook.Don't waste your money folks, look elsewhere, but continue to cook with your kids, it is time well spent!"
2,Disappointed,"Our family loves Rachel Ray on television and my kids were excited when they got her cookbook as a gift. The cartoon-style pictures and unusual names for the dishes are cute, but bad editing and outright mistakes in the recipes make this a frustrating ""first"" cookbook. In one recipe, the cook is told to use a ""medium"" sized pan, after switching from a medium pan to a large one, the food still overflowed. In another recipe, garlic is listed as an ingredient but there is no mention of what to do with it in the directions.We still love Rachel but it seems this book was rushed to market. Better off to use a tried and true basic cookbook for kids!"
5,Love this book!,"I bought this for my 6 year old son, his first ever cookbook. He had a blast reading through it and choosing recipes. The instructions are great, and the food is appealing to children and adults alike. It's nicely written and has really cute drawings of Rachael and her dog Boo. My son loves it, and so do I. I've used some of the recipes myself when I'm cooking! This is a great way to introduce children to cooking and to get them into the kitchen with you."
2,Eh...,"Got this books for my now 8 year old daughter since she's developing her interest in cooking with mom (me). Have to say that many of the recipes seem to be ""off"" -- either in the ingredient amounts or the quantity that it makes. We recently made the Thai Rice Bowl and the recipe fails to note when to add the garlic, as well as when the chicken is ""cooked."" Since this is supposed to be a kids (??) cookbook, I really don't think this is Ray's best book. Also found the Middle Eastern rice bowl (as well as the Thai one) to be completely underseasoned. Also agree with many of the previous posters that Rachael OBVIOUSLY does not have children -- many recipes are not child-friendly (either for cooking it themselves or eating it). Not one of my favorites."
2,Needs real photos,whether for adults or children a cookbook really should include photos of the meals. I should have paid attention to the other reviews. we've tried items from many other cookbooks but I don't think we've used this since we bought it.
2,I know that I will be BOO..ED but oh well,"Well I bought Kids Rock by Rachael Ray and although I thought I had a hit on my hands I was dead wrong. I have made some recipes for my kids, but they responded with the 3 bite test thats it nothing more. I keep racking my brain with them I have no idea what else to do, but this book wasn't a hit with them, and therefore I rated it 2 stars. Still on the search for something MY kids will like other than Nutella and Mortadella."
4,Our favorite Rachael Ray cookbook,"I own 30 minute recipes, more 30 minute recipes and this book. It WAS intended to be for my son (who is an avid reader and loves Rachael Ray's cooking show). Instead, it's our whole family's favorite Rachael Ray cookbook. I don't even use the other ones. She incorporates humor and stories and great pictures along with *real* recipes that families will eat together. I have to say her 5 minute fudge is now MY 5 minute fudge. I detested trying to make fudge before (anyone have fudge that wouldn't *set*?) and this is great! I would recommend this cookbook to anyone. You don't need to have kids either:)"
3,Cute book but...,"This book is great in its concept and layout. The book is sectioned into age groups, the recipes have cute names and it encourages cooking as a great way to bond with your child. That part of the book is wonderful. I have used other Rachel Ray books with no problems and everything turns out fine.However,it seems the measurements are off on a few recipes in this book. For the ""Chicken Toes"" (cute title, a spin on Chicken Fingers) there doesn't seem to be enough coating mix to cover the chicken. In the ""Candy Sushi"" (great idea, easy to make) recipe, it seems to call for too much rice cereal and not enough marshmellow coating. We also made the cheese fries and it produced way too much cheese sauce. I would still recommend this book as a good 1st cookbook for kids, just watch the amounts and be ready to make adjustments accordingly."
1,Fascinating but false,"This appears to be a fascinating account of the aftermath of Hoxha's nightmare dictatorship in Albania. Individuals and places are evocatively described and you begin to get a picture of how they used to survive both the regime and the chaos that followed, often with more dignity and decency than most of us would manage. Extremely annoying is that Jones turns out to have made the whole thing up. He never actually admits it, but I gather from other sources that the central character in the book is completely invented, which means the whole book must be viewed as fiction. An enjoyable read, but is it all a pack of lies?"
4,Great read,A facinating look at a country and culture that was hidden from us for nearly 50 years. Not your normal travelogue...but one with a unique progression to its end.
2,Fictional,Not based on any historical evidence. If you want to read a fairy tale then this is the book for you.
3,Smells Horrible!,"My order came in very quickly (about 3 days) which was a huge plus. However, i'm used to using a braid spray by IC that smells really good. As soon as I sprayed the Mane n Tail on my hair, my stomach literally turned. It has this smell that's almost like spoiled yogurt or something. I just hope that it does good things for my hair."
5,Worth Owning,"I wasn't sure what to think of this book at first. It's a little unorthodox, a little unorganized, a little rambling. But I think there is a method to Lazurus' madness. He manages to bring his ideas across in easily digestable chunks. My one complaint is that the book reads a little more like a rough draft rather than a polished manuscript.Of all the screenwriting books I own (that would be all the big ones and some of the not-so-big-ones) this most clearly brings out what it is really like to be a living, breathing screenwriter. Lazurus is one. He's not the pedantic Syd Field (who to my knowledge has never sold a script) or the methodical Michael Hauge, but what he offers in pragmatism makes up for any shortcomings in presentation.-rdg3"
1,A poor and cynical effort,"Though it has a few decent points, this book feels like a vanity press publication that, in the main, is little more than the author ranting about how Hollywood doesn't appreciate his immense genius, even though that genius has produced nothing other than Stigmata (a film, I should add, whose deep, dark secret - the Gospel of Thomas - is so secret that it has been available as a paperback for many, many years). At one point he claims that most books about screenwriting are merely cynical attempts for failing screenwriters to make a fast buck. He adds that this book is not one of them. He is wrong, it is."
1,Save Your Money,"This could have been a good, very basic book about how to write a screenplay. As a previous reviewer pointed out, Lazarus makes good points about outlining and creating a log line to briefly summarize your story. Outside of that, the Hollywood war stories of the compromises made with tv networks, studios, etc. to get your script to the screen, while interesting and (possibly dated in this era of reality tv and youtube), adds nothing to the more important task of helping the writer craft a story specifically for film."
1,2 good secrets,"Two secrets are good, the rest we've heard before.Secret #1: Organization Is Freedom. I am an outliner, and his way of doing scenes was nice to add to my knowledge.Secret #2: The Log Line. Great look at this very hard concept.But the rest are things that are in every other writing book:Secret 3 Telling the Story Through the CharactersSecret 4 Rising ActionSecret 5 The Matematics of Film WritingSecret 6 Less is moreSecret 7 More is MoreSecret 8 Script Presentation (The Screenwriters Bible does a much better job.Secret 9 Show Not TellSecret 10 Write ShortSecret 11 Rewriting--A survival Course.Then he has some examples.If you know how to write, this isn't for you."
1,Couldn't finish it.,The heroine acted like a 6-year-old. Situation and writing were silly and amateurish at best. I could not finish it.
2,"Not exactly ""historical"" except in setting","In my opinion, there are FAR too many blatant ""slang"" phrases that are 20th Century in origin. These phrases detract from the story line. Oh, right, story line...There IS one, but it's rather weak, with gaps and things ""sorta left out"" and odd stuff thrown in. It wasn't a story that I was able to lose myself into because of the problems. There is ""teasing"" thrown in that should not be there in very serious spots of the novel. If you are looking for historical, try another book. This one is only ""historical"" because of the pirate ship setting. I will never be reading anything by this author again, I was very, very, very disappointed by the amature attempt at writing a historical romance."
5,A treasure-trove of poster art and American popular history.,"This beautiful collection of colorful poster art provides a history of Hollywood and American popular culture in a volume that's a delight to leaf through. As with all of Bruce Hershenson's poster books, this one is a tremendous value!"
3,"The perfect pet by Miquel Avila, age 11, San Diego, CA","The girl wants a pet and she tells her dad to buy her a pet. The dad tells her no because she is too small and she ends with a cactus. I recommend this book for children under five years of age. It is funny. My friend, Pancho, really liked the book. The cactus turned out to be a perfect pet. You did not have to feed it, or take it for a walk."
5,Great writing topic!,This is a great book to use to have your class write a persuasive piece about asking their parents for a pet!
2,Real disappointing sequal,"The first Dr. John's Book of the Dumb was a laugh riot. However, the second one just left me cold... Perhaps with so many books devoted to the dumb things we humans do, this sequal wasn't even necesssary.I'm sorry to say that it's the only Dr John book I've owned that is not going to be part of my permanent collection"
3,The Eater of Tape!,"This is a nice, compact DV camera... has good features and shoots decent quality footage for a 1CCD camera. However, it does suffer from the ""tape eating"" syndrome others have reported here.If you want a trustworthy camera, look elsewhere."
5,Great DV,"I debated between the Canon and Sony lines for weeks, trying each one. It came down to comfort and ease of use. The canon feels much better in my hand, and is much easier to use. Sony is a bit more difficult because it has more features. If you are going to edit on your computer (like me) you don't need any special features. The quality is great, like all camcorders much better outdoors than in. I wish someone would have told me about their whole setup so I didn't have to spend weeks researching, so here it is:Camcorder: Canon Optura 100mcComputer: Dell 600mhz, 384 RAM,Hard Drive: 80gb External Maxtor 3000dv (need lots of room)Video Card: Nvidia gForce2 400mxEditing Software: Pinnacle Studio DV Version 7.XWith the exception of the computer, I bought all of the other pieces after the camera and they all worked perfect. Already edited my own home movie from Thanksgiving and worked perfect.Hope this helps"
4,Great camera but tape eating problem exists...,"I bought this camera almost 3 months back. I am more than satisfied with the handling and the image quality. However, I also am encountering the tape getting stuck while doing a rewind. I thought initially that it was a problem with the tape but after reading the reviews, I am realizing that its a design defect. I would expect Canon to offer some solution since its been a decent investment in getting this camera. Besides that its a very nice camera and I am glad I chose this over a Sony."
4,decent quality at an awesome price,"I bought this set because it's small, light, and compact, and I needed something that would easily fit in my dorm on a college kid's budget. When I first set this product up, it was very crackly, and I was considering just returning them, but it just turned out that one of the wires was a little loose. Once I fixed that, They sounded surprisingly good for how cheap they are. Of course it's not amazing quality, but for what I purchased them for (mostly to watch movies on my laptop in my room) they're great. I'm no audiophile, but they sound very good to me as long as you don't blast them. At higher volumes the quality drops quite a bit, but it's plenty loud enough to fill a couple of rooms. Overall these speakers are good if you want something small compact and cheap, but not the best for people who like to crank it up."
1,Complete crap,"The sound was the worst out of any speakers i've ever owned.. and for $80.. what a ripoff.A few months into use, without ever moving them, the cords create interference and the system, even without being plugged into anything, delivers lots of background static noise.Do not buy this or any speaker product from Maxell."
2,Hollow Bass/Constant Hum,"I bought the Maxell speakers to use with my TV a while ago and it's not bad for the price. However, the bass is hollow and unnatural, as if it's coming out of a box and there is also a constant hum even when the TV is off. The on/off switch is also a little difficult to use. I just bought Labtech speakers [Logitech S220 2.1 Speaker System ]for $25.00 (Oct 25,2008)and these are much higher quality, Sound, Switch and overall appearance. I'm much happier with these."
5,Cool!,"At night, David can fly at daytime he can't. He thinks it fun until he realizes it is dangerous."
3,Food Combining weight loss,"This book is part of Hollywood Health's weight-loss plan, which includes Green Tea and ""spice"" capsules. Less comprehensive than Suzanne Sommers or other food combining diets, it is a simple introduction to this eating method."
5,Love it!!,Good hard rock with great vocals and lyrics and music and everything about it is just good! I'm proud to own this one.
4,Good stuff,"If you like Linkin' Park, you'll probably hear something familiar listening to Red. ""Let Go"" is a great ""i'm pissed"" song. I like to pop that one into the CD player in my car, crank it, and go drive."
4,Red Rocks!,"I enjoy the rock-ier side of Christian music, and this cd is really hot! Almost head banging music, with an orchestral backgrounds, it is different and diverse....should appeal to those Christian rockers who love intense lyrics and music to get you going!"
4,Red - End Of Silence,"The Up Side: Melodic hard rock layered with classical instrumetals and a Linkin Park-esque atmosphere. Good vocals, clean production and easily accessible lyrics. Also, many of the songs here run past the 5 minute mark, breaking the cycle of 3 1/2 minute radio ready slush.The Down Side: Only 9 songs! Already Over (part II) is a reprise of the original (i.e you'll be skipping it), and Intro isn't a song at all. In addition, not every song on End Of Silence is as strong as the first two singles.The Flip Side: Those who otherwise wouldn't listen to alternative metal will be drawn in by the heavy use of violin, piano and digital track in each composition.The Conclusion: End Of Silence is a worty listen while we wait for new material from Chevelle, Linkin Park and 10 Years.The End."
4,"Dark, Powerful, Emotional...","I was skeptical about this band at first hearing that they were a Christian band (don't really see how they consider themselves a Christian band). However, after listening to this cd it blew away all my doubts. The first 5 songs (not including the first track) are outstanding, and the rest are decent. I could do without the violin parts in some songs though (for example, the end of Let Go) which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. This is supposed to be a rock band not an orchestra, but they do pull it off well in some tracks (Lost).Finding traces of Linkin Park and Breaking Benjamin in this band, the sound is not too original. However, I don't think a band necessarily needs to be original to be an outstanding band, and this is definately what defines Red thus far. The emotionally powerful yet enlightening nature of the lead singer and songs are everything a rock fan wants. Definately worth purchasing."
5,INSANE,"This cd is the first cd i've ever listened to that doesn't have any filler. This is one of the best cd's i've ever listened to. But, if you really want to hear these guys you have to see them live......INSANE"
5,Not into Christian Rock? That's ok--you'll like it.,"I absolutely love this CD. I heard ""Already Over"" on the radio and fell in love with the song, but was put off by it being Christian rock. I didn't want to hear about god, I wanted to hear rock music. I got exactly that."
5,Amazing album,"I have been hooked on this album from the very first track. No matter what my mood seems to be, I can put this album on and thoroughly enjoy it every time. One of the features I really like about the album is the way they smoothly transition between hard, soft, and acoustic rock. These transitions occur both album wide and in individual tracks. The music and lyrics are perfectly matched and at some points nearly move me to tears."
5,Blown Away,"I don't care if its Christian rock, nu-metal, whatever....this stuff is good. My first thought when I heard Breathe Into Me was, ""did Linkin Park release a new album?"" I instantly liked the song and decided to buy the cd based on just this song. Wow, was I in store for a collection of well-crafted, heavy hitting songs! Break Me Down, Wasting Time, and Let Go are just a few of the other heavy songs. I can't say that many albums are great from start to finish but this is one of them. It goes in my 5 star group along with Green Day's Warning, Dokken's Back for the Attack, and Metallica's Black album (your 5 star albums will likely differ, but these are mine). ""Inspired"" is another word that comes to mind when listening to this offering from Red. Great lyrics, tight melodies, and heavy riffs. Not a filler track on the entire disc. Nice job fellas."
5,Awesome,"I first heard this band on Octane on my Sirius radio. I loved their sound. I ordered this CD because it was pretty inexpensive. I am so glad that I did. It is really, really good. I will definitely be listening to it a lot!"
