1,GETTING WORSE WITH EACH SEASON!!,"Season Three of this stupid sitcom is probably the worst yet. My sisters like it but I find it socially and morally degrading. I'm tired of programs like this which continually choose to glorify family dysfunctionalism to the point where it has become the norm in today's society. Its a shame that America has come to this. The worst episode of the lot here is the one called ""Happy Pills"". Making fun of people who take anti-depressants is cruel, offensive and demeaning. But then this program is offensive and demeaning so why should I expect anything less."
1,More Junk Television when compared to classics of yesterday!,"Used to be we could sit down and watch a program on television and find some escapism or at least comical situations grounded in reality that made sense and did not offend anyone. Such is not the case with this plodding, mish-mash of rejected Rosanne scripts called ""Reba"". It is fine that it shows a family sticking together but the end does not justify the means. Apparently Reba McEntire wants to think she can top Lucille Ball!! But at least Lucy's shows were not offensive to anyone. I am a manager at a Media Play so I get to watch newly released DVD sets and movies to recommend on our displays. Reba sells o.k. but that's because she appeals to a ""messed-up"" society."
1,I WILL NOT BE ORDERING THIS SET!,"I ordered the first two and was appalled at how America has come to the point it has and to have someone like Reba McEntire endorse some of the things she does on this series is contributing to the moral decay of our society. That said, may I also add that Reba McEntire is a good singer but a very, very bad actress!! Now, Hit the button that says that this review was NOT helpful and prove my point about the support of of programs like this that endorse bad morals."
5,Just the best book to start out in magic.,"Well I must be honest. Micah is a personal friend of mine. He is also one of the most accomplished card magician's I know. Now you don't have to take me at my word, ask some of the greats like Herb Zarrow, creator of the Zarrow shuffle, or Meir Yedid or Richard Robinson, Just to name a few. Now as a magician myself I speak from the technical view here, Micah started this book when he was 12. His dad help put him in touch with the people he needed to to consult with on the book. He did and they did. What you have here is not Micah at his most accomplished but a guide, to kids or adults, who would like a simple concise and informative instruction on magic. The margin notes on many pages give incites into the history of magic or a routine and some wonderful antidotes. I suggest you get this book if you want to learn some exciting ways to entertain your friends and family. Enjoy, I have two."
1,"I love you, Micah","I know its just a book, but there's no other way to explain what Micah does other than calling it magic. Just give the book a chance and I promise you will experience the same magic that I have felt through Micah's eloquent writing. However, while the majority of the tricks are simple and, to be honest, somewhat worthless, there is one that I found simply mind-altering. You can see for yourself, but the trick where you disappear and end up in the closet is truly astonishing. I still haven't left."
5,great item!,the size 3 fit my kel-tec p11 9mm like a glove it looks like it was made just for my gun i keep inside my motorcycle vest it dont flop around or nothing
3,Fits well but pushes RUGER LCP CT laser button,"Overall, I was happy with the fit of the holster with my Ruger LCP .380, until I noticed that the edge of the holster presses the ON button of my Crimson Trace laser on the handgrip of the pistol. Too bad, but I don't need a dead laser battery."
3,Gun outline shows when in pants,"It's a good product if you just want something to put your Ruger LCP in. However, the outline of the gun still shows thru your pants. Probably, some leather type rectangular pocket holster would be better at consealing the gun outline."
4,"Good bargain, good product.","It fits well, stays in the pocket, comfortable, compact. Not the best for some pocket carry, but does well in carpenter jeans, tactical pants, some khaki pants. Affords easy and quick draw from the pockets it fits."
3,Pocket Holster,"My first one that was made in USA lasted six years of daily concealed carry with S & W Model 38. Protected it from lint, dirt, makes drawing easier from Blackie Collins' concealed carry blue jeans.This one is now made in Vietnam and does not seem as well stitched and made."
5,Great Pocket Holster,"This product is great. Having the security of being armed and no one around is any wiser. I carry a Taurus Millennium Pro .40 and the Size 4 holster is perfect. Nicely conceals the business end of the gun while leaving the grip readily accessible.I have carried this in dress pants, jeans and shorts and it is very comfortable.I would definitely recommend this to friends."
2,Not as good as I thought it'd be,"I was disappointed with this product. It might have been the gun I carried or my particular pants, but I think most people are buying this for an LCP-type gun and I wear very normal pants/shorts. I carried a Ruger LCP in it for about two months. The only two things I can say I liked about this is that the holster completely covered the trigger guard and the holster looks to be of sufficent quality as to not fall apart immediately. The gun was not easy to pull out of my pocket, and more often than not, the holster came out with the gun. Not to mention, I basically lost the use of my strong side pocket while carrying. I've since switched to a cheap IWB holster and it's significantly nicer to carry (less noticeable, more comfortable, easier access, and I still have use of my pocket). I'll keep the Uncle Mike's pocket holster for use in coat pockets and such, but it's unlikely to see use again in my pants pockets."
3,Not great for the Ruger LCP,"Bought it for the Ruger LCP and it had too much ""print"" for my liking. I went with a generic on ebay and like it much more. Uncle Mikes usually has some great products. Just wish this one was a bit bigger or fit a little better."
3,Decent Product,Got one for my wife to carry her Ruger LCP in. Fits nicely in her purse and decent quality for the price.
2,Not for LCP w/ LaserMax,"I bought this for a Ruger LCP w/ LaserMax. It fits, but its too snug. When I pull the gun out of my pocket, the holster comes with it. I think this would still be the case w/o the laser...unless you wear skin tight pants, this holster will not grip in the pocket. If you're gonna buy, buy a size larger."
3,Can't beat the price but it could stay in the pocket better.,"Functional, effective, unobtrusive, no frills holster. It could stay in the pocket better. At this price, I'm happy with my purchase."
4,Inside the pocket holster,Received the item pretty fast from Amazon.com The holster was just what I needed and fit great. Recommend it to others needing a in the pocket holster for a .380
3,Some problems,"Overall, a good pocket holster, but I had some issues with it that caused me to look elsewhere. If I used it in loose fitting jeans with large pockets I found that it wouldn't stay upright in the pocket. The holster is vary narrow at the bottom which allows it to move around in the pocket as you walk or move, eventually tipping forward to the point that the gun was horizontal in the pocket. Not good. Also, it had problems staying put. I would frequently draw the pistol and have the holster come along for the ride. It worked fine in tighter pants. Stayed put and made for a quick clean draw. But in loose fitting pants with large pockets, I don't recommend it."
5,Great Pocket Holster,"Fits my Ruger LCP like a glove. Keeps the dirt and lint off the pistol. Very comfortable in the pocket, good price, and doesn't print the pistol in the pocket. Would recommend the holster for anyone who is looking for a pocket holster without spending alot of money for your LCP or your Kel Tec P3AT."
2,Lack of consistency,I had a well used Uncle Mike's holster of the same type and it worked well. After three years of daily use with my LCP I bought a new one. Unfortunately the dimensions were different and did not fit the same LCP and was too loose. I am very disappointed with their quality control as I now own a holster that doesn't work with my weapon.
4,Good for the money fits SCCY CPX-2,"Good pocket holster for the money.I will eventually get a Mika holster but needed something now while waiting.Fits the SCCY CPX-2 well,less printing if you use flat mag base pads.I understand the need to make a profit as I am a true capitalist but am disappointed none the less that this holster is made in Vietnam.I would gladly pay more for these to be made in the USA."
3,"Hmm, OK","These probably work great for snub nose revolvers and the like, but not my Walther PPK. The fit is good and the rubber sticks to my pocket well when I draw the gun, but the weight of the gun tends to scrunch up the bottom corner of the holster and lets the gun tip too far towards my open pocket."
4,Great Holster,I really like this holster. The outer material grips the pocket enough to allow you to draw without pulling the holster out of the pocket altogether. I recommend it.
5,excellent concealment holster,I use it with my Charter arms mag pug .357 snubby great holster stays in pocket when you pull out the gun hides the out line of the gun well you can't tell whats in your pocket
3,DECENT BUDGET POCKET HOLSTER,"I'm going to make this short and sweet. If you are looking for a pocket holster for home use or to hold you over until you can afford something better this is for you. I would not recommend this for an every day Concealed Carry holster. It does not help with printing very much and it does not cover the trigger or trigger guard. Just a heads up the holster looks like the one in the ""customer image."" Mine is all black which is fine with me as I like the look better."
2,Don't Buy for Taurus TCP 738,"This product says it will fit most .380s; but, the Taurus TCP 738 .380 won't fit into it at all. It may fit smaller .380s, but not the Taurus. Good feel, though. Returns to Amazon are very easy! Thanks, Amazon!"
3,Good for me...Great for others,"Let me say from the beginning that I'm a fan of this Uncle Mike's Off-Duty Concealment holster. Recently I purchased a Ruger LCP for a deeper level of concealment. Sadly, the LCP seems to fall between size 2 and size 3 holsters. The quality of this pouch holster is amazing. The neoprene feel of the holster protects both the weapon and the garments of the user comfortably while holding securely in a waistband or back pocket.If this pouch fit my weapon better I would have rated it a 5 out of 5."
2,Too Slippery,"I got one of these for a small revolver, and it worked fine. I got this one for a small automatic, and it is impossible to grab only the grip. To extract the automatic, I must pinch the grip between thumb and forefinger and pull, and that brings up both the automatic and the holster, as the exterior material does not grip the pocket."
5,Angels Awakening,Wow! This is a must hear for all music lovers. The wonderful selection of many familiar songs combines with the soothing effect of the harp to make a super CD! Very inspiring! Can't wait for her next CD.
4,good stroller for price,"This is a good stroller. It is lightweight and also easy to break down. It is easy to push with one hand if both hands are not available. Color and print is nice. Love the storage space. It is adjustable. My baby boy loves to sleep in the carseat so I am assuming that it is very comfortable for him. Now the cons about this system is that the base requires a car to have something so the base could be latch on. We don't have that so we are not able to use the base with the carseat. Also, the buttons on the side of the carseat to adjust the handle is a bit hard to push. But all in all the system is good."
4,It's not all Prince Charmings and Happily Ever Afters,"This movie disturbed me but was still unbelievably compelling to watch as the three main characters, the father, the son, and the daughter wage an internal war upon each other.The father and son return after an humiliating experience at war only to find that the battle continues with each other at home. The son is constantly berated by the father for his shortcomings. The father forces the daughter to express the same emotions of compassion and love she shows to her brother to him. What ends up happening is a fierce battle of strength versus intelligence.A disturbing, compelling, and haunting movie. Be warned, it's not for all tastes."
5,A unique and scary insight,"This book is a unique and scary insight into what we have become and what we might yet become if we don't wake up and start treating the world like a huge landfill. I'm a medical professional (RN) and by no means a granola-eater or tree hugger, but after reading this book, I stopped taking my world for granted and started giving thanks for little things, like the food I eat, the plants that give me oxygen and food, the sun that gives life to all, etc. Pay specific attention to the prophecies toward the end of the book. If they aren't a wake-up call, I don't know what is!Excellent book, highly recommended, as are any of Tom Brown's books. He's an even more powerful speaker than an author, so if you have an opportunity to see him, do it!"
4,Behind the Music of Amulance,"You can read the full story behind Amulance (and their name) by Googling the phrase ""Secret History of Chicago Music: Amulance."""
5,Muy buen resumen de la temporada,"Aunque el resultado de la temprada 2008 no fue el deseado por mi ya que soy fan a muerte de Ferrari, el resumen es muy bueno.Está filmado con una calidad de imagen excelente.Recomendado para todos los amantes de la F1."
5,Excellent DVDs!!!,Very good summary of the 2008 season - excellent quality and back of the scene interviews
1,Only for the Lewis Rammilton fans,"So disappointing there is nothing good in this DVD, well except if you are a LH fan. There should be more focus on all the teams and not just LHGetting so tired of Bernie's PR Machine, he has lost it.Are you a LH fan you will love it."
2,Disappointing video quality,"While the races are covered fairly well and there are a few bonus features, the video quality is very disappointing. Another viewer noted the same trouble I experienced and called it ""panning artifacts."" Namely, when the camera follows the cars moving quickly, there is a pronounced blurring/stuttering effect. It is very distracting and takes away from the race and commentary. I actually stopped watching about five races in because of it. Why can't these guys get it right? Be warned - this DVD is for you only if you are a hardcore fan and MUST have each year's review. Otherwise, those looking for a neat and effective wrap-up of last season will come away disappointed."
2,The Official Review of the 2008 FIA Formula One Championship,"The DVD has a spot on it where there is poor quality throughout the entire DVD. This is a problem on all DVDs, not just mine, based on other's reviews. There is a fluttering of sort that distorts the picture. I am very surprised that Formula 1 did not catch this problem during production."
1,A good movie to fall asleep to...,"dont waste the money for shipping let alone money to purchase the movie. Heder is funny, but not in this movie. Poor Diane Keaton... what has her career come to."
3,Eh.,It wasn't as awful as I expected.It was nice to see Anna Faris not play a complete nimrod like she usually does.
1,Sicko!,One of the worst movies I've ever tried to watch. I couldn't even finish it. It borders on incestuous. I paid just over a dollar for it plus shipping and it wasn't even close to worth that!
2,Returned,"Thankfully before I opened the package on this DVD I saw a preview of this movie. I'm a fan of Jn Heder's Napoleon Dynamite and I friend of my at work recommended I see Mama's Boy. After seeing the preview of this movie, I returned it immediately. So I can't right a fair review but to me it looked like it would be a waste of money."
3,Chimply Marvelous,Charley is exactly what I expected. Somewhat scary when his eyes bug out. I bought it because my granddaughter loves a segment of Baby Einstein that has a chimp playing the cymbals. She was excited when she saw Charley.
2,too loud,this toy looks good and does what it should the volume is just extreme for something i paid 40 bucks for it should have a volume control...wish i didn't waste my money on something that im going to take the batteries out of asap.
3,slightly disappointed,"CD and tape produced by Pilz Entertainment is disappointing. The sound is slightly muffled. Songs are good - sound, not so good."
3,wrong order,"Unfortunately, the dealer did not have the correct CD. He sent me a Christmas CD by mistake.He did credit my account, and also told me keep the CD."
1,Poor quality needle drop,"Songs are great, but this is a badly done needle drop (LP recorded to a CD). Sound quality is poor and at least one song is cut off. Avoid and just spin your old record."
1,"Small cans, bland taste","I tried doing some grocery shopping off of Amazon since I don't have a car. Well, it didn't work so well. This soup I bought was pretty tasteless, and the cans are pretty small. I didn't realize it when I was ordering, but 15 ounces isn't very much soup. I won't be buying this product again."
1,no good,Bought a v7 19 inch lcd in may of 2006.And it died sept 2007.it had a 1 year warr on it.call the company and they said they would fix it for 100.00 plus shipping.I didnt pay good money for this to died in 16 months.
3,Sight Cuts?,"Are these for 1911 government model sight cuts, or Novak sight cuts? I have a 1911 gvt. model with G.I. mil spec sights."
1,Not good,This boiok is a mess. THis man was never crowned or even initiated into the Religion he was a SHAM and he took most of this information by listening to propperly trained and initiated priests and prioestesses. I cant endorse this book and support this nonsense.
4,OK book,"I agree with Dan. I would recommend Multiagent systems by Weiss. The book presents a coherent text on MAS, and the authors are reknowned experts in their fields. Also, check out Rules of Encounter by Rochenschein and Zlotkin"
5,This video is great,"Talespin volume 7 is the best of all the volumes. The first episode, ""Molly Coddled"" is about Molly finding a small statue and finds out the clever Covington, needs it to get the largest ruby. But Molly ends up getting a plan to stop Covington. And in, ""The Sound and the Furry"" Wildcat finds some furry animals. But they reall belong to Crazy Edie, a no-good mechanic whop uses them to damage o she charge money to fix them. The fur really begins to fly as Edie unleashes then at Baloo's airshow. But Wildcat helps Baloo out and Edie ends getting grease and spooned."
4,It still rusts.,"The stainless is magnetic, so probably it is 18/0 stainless. It shows rust sitting outside after one rain:(After two months use, I upgrade it to 4 stars. I now keep it indoor in the garage. Functionally it works well and the handle never gets hot even when the steel tube glows red."
5,A Must Have,"If you are going to barbecue you must have a charcoal chimney. It eliminates the need for starter (which is both unsafe and leaves a nasty aftertaste on quick-cooked foods). Starts your charcoal quickly and brings it to cooking temperature. It's easy, too. And this particular one is a great one."
3,Gets the job done,"This is a nice looking Charcoal Chimney. The materials SHOULD last a while. However, on first use one of the rivets holding the platform (bottom) up popped off. Not THAT big of a deal, I'll just put a little screw in it's place. But considering this is the job it was intended for, it should have lasted much more than less than one time. Fortunately the metals used seem decent, so it isn't a major loss. The wood handle is a must and does its job well of keeping the handle cool."
5,Very good and useful book,This book introduces the physicists applications of differential geometry in physics.It is a complete book in classical field theory.Moreover it is very interesting to see the geometry of relativity.I highly recommend this book for the theoretical physicists and the mathematicians interested in physics.In short this is a very useful book.
5,Great box but NOT Vista compatable,Box a couple of these different HD enclosures only to learn that you need to read the fine print. Most on not yet Vista compatable. XP found it in a heartbeat and it works great. Took less than five minutes to set it up. Stands up by itself with cool blue lights underneath.Decided to keep to use with my XP and sent back the AZIO one as it was not as sturdy or as quick to be recognized on the XP machine I was using.
3,Just OK,I thought they were new but the cards had been re-packaged. The cards were not as helpful as I hoped.
3,Only 12 cards,"I have another series of Louise Hay cards and it's a much larger set, so I was initially disappointed to get such a slim set. The cards are good, some don't pertain to your life so much, and some hit it on the head, that's why it's good to have more. I do use these by posting the ones I most like on my bathroom mirror, one at a time, and try to reflect on it for a week or so. I use the Power Thought cards by Louise hay also... a 64 card deck."
3,So-so,These were just okay. I much prefer the other Louise Hay decks- such as the Power Thought cards- there were very few cards in this deck and seemed to be repetition of some of the better decks out there.
4,sallyyan,"1) Most of the pictures are nice & some of the affirmations are useful ~2) For me, the affirmation statements of 'Healthy Body cards' are more useful,but there's no various pictures in 'Healthy Body cards'.3) I prefer the paper box pack with beautiful design like 'Healthy Body cards' & 'Inner Peace cards'.While, there's only a simple transparent (hard) plastic box pack of 'Forgiveness'."
3,Quick Fix,"These are pretty good, but of course nothing like this can fit every situation. I'd rather the cards weren't two-sided so I could take out the ones which are helpful and leave the rest."
2,"Is not 100 IU as described, is marked 200 IU on bottle",The title says it all. These are soft capsules so it's a mess having to break them open to get 100 IU which is my dog's dosage.
5,Delightful depiction of Cajun culture and dialect,"This title features creative, colorful illustrations and dialogue that portray the unique Cajun culture and dialect of Louisiana. A young girl triumphs in the end as she shows the men and boys in her family that she is as capable as they are of going alligator hunting."
5,"For book-reading Dads & Moms everywhere, a must-read!","Having read hundreds of children's books to my 3 boys over the years, this book is a complete joy. The story telling is unique, the illustrations are ""Caldecott"" worthy. All in all Thomassie's books are a welcome change for Dad's and Mom's everywhere."
4,The Coming of The Ice Age,"Jerry Butler has long been one of the best R&B; singers in music. Here at last you get his best two albumson 1 CD. 60 minutes of pure magic. Almost all the hits are here, Hey Western Union Man, Only The StrongSurvive, Moody Woman, What's The Use of Breaking Up and a Brand New Me. It is a great collectionthat exemplifies his talent and skill as a great singer. It is well worth the purchase. My only negativeis would have been nice to include He Will Break Your Heart, Find Another Woman,Time and Faith, and his last hit, Mr. Dream Merchant."
5,Too Cute....Brite Colors...,"Adorable book, colors kept the kids busy for hours...my kids just love these books...would highly recommend"
2,Title is misleading and the writing is obtuse,The description of the book made me believe that I would learn more about how children develop morals. The greatest revelation of the psychiatrist author is that character is the foundation of behavior. There are few novel thoughts stuck somewhere in the lengthy descriptions of his meetings. I felt at times he focused too much on creating a mood or setting that is best left to fiction.
2,Don't expect to see any real solution in this book.,"I bought the book, expecting to know the solution on how to raise my kids so that they become good members of the society. But what I got was just a guideline that I should teach my children well during their early years. It's all too simple to hear from such an expert. There is nothing new on how to raise a moral child compared with what I can get from a good how-to-raise-a-child book. The quality of contents in this book is no way near Emotional Intelligence"
2,WHERE WAS THE EDITOR?,"That Robert Coles' heart is in the right place and that his experience working with children is extensive, no one can dispute. But his writing is characterized by wordiness - even chattiness - and it undermines the serious nature of his topic. Perhaps the loose writing style is an attempt to make the book appeal to ""every parent,"" - and not just educators - but instead it renders the whole work laborious and permeated with a condescending, patronizing tone. In the current political culture, a book on the moral life of children written by an educator of Coles' calibre would be expected to nail a spot on the N.Y. Times bestseller list for weeks, if not years. The fact that less than two years after publication I picked up a hard cover copy at a book clearance for 75% off is a testimony to lazy editorship more than anything else. What a huge loss for our society."
1,"Never receive this item, we contacted company, they said will refund $10 for the shipping but nothing came","The item never came, we contacted owner, he said will refund $10 shipping fee and will ship again on the 16th of July, but nothing came, we called him and left message, he never return the call."
5,Great Fall Cookie and Sandwich Cutters,This is a great set of Fall Cookie Cutters. I have the Christmas Cutters from this company as well. I like that there are a multitude of sizes so that two of the cutters can be used to cut shapes out of sandwiches for our 5 year olds lunch box with hardly any waste. I used the cutters to make fun shapes out of slices of cheese and lunch meat as well - making our version of fun snackables - cheaper and much cuter. These cutters work much better then plastic ones and easily cut through sandwiches or cookie dough. I plan to buy more of these sets.
3,Fall Fun,"Like every cookie cutter growing up. They work like I would expect them to. You always have to remember to have the dough cold, if it didn't cut well then that was the reason. They worked well, I liked them. And the ring keeping them all together is great."
5,Great cookie cutters,I have used these numerous times and love them. My kids can use them with ease. We have used them for Autumn cookies and Halloween cookies. I also have used them to make shapes for sandwiches. I am glad I bought them. The ring is great if you have a problem with losing cookie cutters...that's my family...so far we haven't lost one.
4,Blackbyrds: LoveByrds...,"Don't get me wrong folks! I am a serious Blackbyrds fan from 1974! If they were to re-title this ""Blackbyrds: An Introduction,"" or, ""Blackbryds: Mellow"" that would've been perfect packaging. But the Title of the disc and the contents therein clash to a degree, as there are:1. Dance Cuts (Lady, Time is Movin', Flying High)2. Mellow Instrumentals (Love is Love, All I Ask)3. Mellow tunes with Vocals (Soft and Easy, Summer Love, April Showers)with several other tunes that fall somewhere, ""in between."" Finally, the one BIG omission, ""A Love So Fine"" from the City Life LP. How could they have possibly left that one off this collection? Absolutely, CRIMINAL!However, I still recommend this collection to newbies ($11.98/US is a good price!), everyone else - save your money and get the CD's!My rating: 5 stars - 1 star (omitting A Love So Fine) = 4 Stars!"
3,Can You Tell Them Why,"There are very few times when a great cover song can be remade into something good, but also something worse. Nevertheless, there are the ones that are in-between. For a Hip Hop and Soul group like Brownstone, they had a middle of the road version, but just had a bit too much. Their rendiditon of the classic Eagles song, I Can't Tell You Why, was covered in the wake of success in the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over reunion. Sadly for Brownstone, they had a fair cover, but it just doesn't measure up that the original version the classic rock song made out. Here, it just seems too much in the soul, not in the simplicity of the song. Even though, Brownstone is no more, they could hopefully do a better groups of songs if they reunite someday.Song: C 1/2+"
2,DOES NOT WORK,THIS DVD DID NOT WORK. THE FORMAT WAS TO OLD FOR MODERN DVD PLAYERS. I CAN NOT WATCH THIS DVD ON MY DVD PLAYER. IF I KNEW IT WOULD NOT PLAY ON MY DVD PLAYER I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT.
2,"3 place Commercial Open Trailer Trimmer rack for Stihl, Echo, Tanaka...","Very light metal, had to take to the welder and have the struts reinforced twice. Not recommended for rough roads."
3,Entertaining rustic fiction,"Ryall writes in an entertaining voice, like your old Witch grandmother sitting you down by the fire to tell you about how it was in the Old Country when she was a girl. A warm and friendly presence, a rustic and straightforward system. The problem is that her claims to historical accuracy simply are unfounded - there is no evidence that anything like what she described ever existed. She repeats the old myth about widespread illiteracy and ancient secret tradition to excuse the lack of historical documentation of the Wiccan tradition in the area - an area that had been intensively documented by local folklorists and amateur historians for hundreds of years!The system is evocative (though the human sacrifices are a bit much). After 19 years as a Witch, I am not convinced that there was a consistent Pagan tradition in England (or Wales) prior to Gardner. Perhaps I read too much history - I want evidence, not just a pleasant style."
3,Old News,"After reading so many wonderful reviews, I was looking so forward to reading this book, especially as I have ancestors that come from the West Country. This book was a grave disappointment. The author's style called ""chatty"" by some is quite disorganized, jumping from subject to subject and never staying long enough to really delve into the depths.The sections on ritual and festival were really nothing new despite the author's claims of pre-Gardenerian tradition. I was quite disappointed.The chapters titles ""Items of Interest"" does have some nice folk traditions/history described. Likewise the chapters on Folk recipies and remedies are also interesting.Overall there is nothing in this book (for the most part) that you can't find for free on the internet."
5,Great Book,"This is one of the very best books there are in witchcraft. It is very simply written, and contains some very poweful material, including a ritual that really works, which is more than can be said for most of the books out there. This is a must have book for anyone seriously interested in the craft."
4,Logitech Keyboard,"Recently received your Internet/Logitech 350 Vista Qualified USB Keyboard. Unlike another brand that was advertised as compatible with Vista, this one did actually work, and I am completely satisfied with it and would certainly recommend it."
1,"5 Pc Servalier Bowl Set, by tupperware","I purchased the bowl set from My Kids College Fund, but the wrong bowl set was sent. I was very disappointed and returned the one that was sent for a refund. I have my heart set on the 5 Pc Servalier Bowl Set by tupperware so Iam going to continue to look for it. I realize Amazon has it for $75.00 but that is more than I can afford to give. I was unable to rate it because I didn't receive the right one."
5,First and best ITF forms books,"Jhoon Rhee's series of hyung books were the first in the U.S. documenting the ITF forms. Except for this first book, these books present two of the forms for each belt up to 1st degree Black Belt. This book uses the rest of the space to demonstrate the basic techniques.Overall, excellent presentations of these forms, especially the photo sequences that show you the entire form on one page, which is very useful for quickly scanning the form. Also, the author indicates where the kiai should be, which other kata books I've seen neglect to show you."
3,Well illustrated,"My first impression was one of disappointment. I had anticipated a book demonstrating the hyung patterns, rather than a book demonstrating the various techniques applied in them.Once I was over that first batch of disappointment, however, I came to appreciate the book for what it is worth -- a good book on illustrating ITK moves. I liked the way the photographies are handled, with overhead views as well as side-views.It was not what I was looking for, but a good book never the less. I recommend it."
4,basic TKD,Chon-Ji is the first form that many of us must master. Sometimes it is too much to take in and one wishes that they could see the whole thing particularly the places where they have trouble. Jhoon Rhee's book is a big help. It explains the moves and shows them from different angles but more importantly he explains the martial applications. Too many people do not understand this aspects of the hyungs. Remember that you should do each form several hundred times before testing. Jhoon Rhee's series should be in any good TKD library.
4,Almost perfect,"I quickly received the Drive Medical transport chair. After assembling the various pieces I could not adjust one of the leg/foot rests. I wrote to the company to get a replacement part but I have not heard back from them. The beige plaid chair print is cute and unusual. Not the usual ""institutional"" black color of many wheelchairs. I still wait to hear about a replacement for the faulty leg rest."
2,Broke,"Used the chair for about a year and a half, and then the weld on the bottom rail broke, where the curve starts to go over the front wheel.We were on vacation; had to throw it away and buy a steel one from a drugstore.It worked well while it worked, but don't expect it to last forever; the fact it does not come with a long warranty on the frame should tell you that, too."
5,Fills the Bill,"I bought this item for my adult disabled daughter to use on short trips. I was getting tired of lugging her big wheelchair around, which has to be taken apart and put together and weighs a ton. So far, this little chair has been great and we have been able to get out more than we did before. I should have gotten one years ago!"
1,"Rating mostly for horrid service, not for chair","The chair seems well made enough for the price BUT the reason I ordered this particular transport chair was because of the unusual plaid color. I recieved black. If I had wanted black, I'd have ordered it. Just getting the wrong colored chair to my home was a nightmare. I ordered this on the 30th of November and needed it for my mother. I tracked it from Texas to Va and anticipated delivery to WV within a day or two. Imagine my dismay when I saw it two days later back in Texas!! This was a customer service nightmare. Amazon blamed UPS, UPS blamed Amazon. No one was really sympathetic to my plight. It was like ""Oh well, it'll get there sooner or later."" Once it did, the box was in pieces and like I said, it was the antithesis of cheerful plaid. The footrests are really flimsy but other than that, it seems like it will be fine for limited use. Not long term use but then what does one expect for $117? Better customer service, that's what!!!!"
1,unsafe product,"I bought two bacteria test kits from watersafe. The 1st test showed a yellow purple color indicating a possibility of bacteria. The second test kit, taken a week later showed the same result. The test was inconclusive and a waste of money. I had to take the water to a lab and spend $50.00 to find my drinking water was bacteria free..I would never buy this product as it is totally unreliable."
3,Potential detection...,"Easy to use. You simply put about 5ml of water you want to test into the tube, shake 20 seconds, then put in a warm place for 48 hours (not a minute as it says on the Amazon page). And it says in the instructions that this cannot be used to certify water as safe for drinking, it only provides approximate results, and the results can only tell you if there is harmful bacteria potentially detected."
1,Waste of money,"The instructions say the sample will turn yellow (probable bacteria) or purple (no bacteria). Those are the only possible outcomes listed in the instructions. My sample turned yellowish-purple. Useless, in other words."
4,Keeps the old soldier going!,"If you have an old Socket 7 or Socket 370 CPU system you will probably need one of these fans at some point in time. (Especially for Socket 7 CPUs as these did not have built-in thermal monitoring/protection features so a failed fan will cause damage)In my case I'm replacing the fan on some old Intel Pentium 100/AMD K5 systems and this works for me. Be sure to doublecheck your old CPU fan height clearance before ordering - some motherboard/cases may have the hard drive mounted above the CPU in which case height clearance may be an issue. The height on the heatsink & fan is approx 41mm from chip to top of fan. The fan is labelled as a ball bearing fan so it should last awhile.Heatsink & fan comes with 3-pin motherboard connector, adapter for Molex hard drive/cdrom style 4-pin connector as well as a single use pack of generic heatsink compound."
5,Lyrical and moving,"Erdrich blends experiences from her three daughters about pregnancy and the first year to evoke the conflicting passions of motherhood. Writing in a small building accross the road from the New Hampshire farmhouse she shared with her husband, the writer Michael Dorris, and their 5 children, Erdrich skillfully sets the changes occurring in her body and her infant's against sharp observations about the natural world, domestic life and the changing seasons. Never maudlin or saccharine, this book is a treasure. Lovers of Erdrich's fiction and poetry will not be disappointed."
4,Informative and helpful,"This book seems to be mostly written for the gifted teacher, but is helpful in discussing some of the socio-emotional needs of gifted kids, how they deal with the label and definitions of gifted."
4,Emotional Needs of Gifted Students,This book contains good information about supporting gifted students with their different needs in the realms of social interactions and emotional issues.
3,"Good CD and foldout diagram, but flow too quick for me","I'm at a beginner level and I was looking for a CD to supplement my practice. I really appreciated the CD and the care that went into producing it. My favored approach to yoga is a slow mediative practice, so there were two minor issues with the CD: 1) I wanted to hold the poses longer, as in my 90 min yoga class. The flow seemed quick to me, but I could be an ultra slow yoga person, and 2) I found the speed of her voice too ""fast"" for me. It's a very subtle thing, so I don't think people would be annoyed. I wasn't used to a teacher talking so quickly and found myself distracted by it.All in all, if you want the CD to take you through the moves, it seems like a great CD. I tried Yoga Sanctuary right afterwards and liked Shiva Rea's flow and tone of voice much better. It might be a preference thing as you could consider Shiva Rea's voice ""sleepy"" instead of ""calming"". :)"
3,Everything But The Girl - Driving,"On Everything But the Girl's second DRIVING disc, Todd Terry somehow manages to have three different mix names for essentially the same track. Sure, the ""Acapella Mix"" is a DJ tool, but he could have tried harder. Elsewhere, Masters at Work also house up the song, but strip the vocals almost entirely. The mix to go to here is the Underdog mix, which takes the song into hip-hop, with a slightly dark edge."
5,A little something different,I own all 3 albums made by Benny Benassi/Benassi Bros. and phobia seems to break the mold. Benny Benassi normally has an edgy acid house sound but in phobia took a new direction to sound more like trance with dirty synth leads. If you enjoy Benny Benassi or trance you will enjoy this album.
3,It's all-right...,"This Cd is OK...The best track by far is ""Feel Alive"". If the CD included more tunes such as ""Feel Alive"", I would of given it 5 stars very easy. I still rate it in the high 3 stars area. I'm sure many would rate this CD in the 4's."
3,There's nothing like the truth.,"Anyone who doesn't appreciate the effectiveness of this movie has never lived in Louisiana. The complicated relationships between the races is perfectly depicted in the characters of Candy, Mathu, Sheriff Mapes, and the Boutans. The book upon which this movie is based is an outstanding work of reality disguised as fiction. The film version does a creditable job of transferring literature to the screen--that is, until the ending. The movie's conclusion is not as effective as that in the book (A GATHERING OF OLD MEN, by Ernest J. Gaines). All-in-all, however, this one is worth seeing!"
4,Black American History,I enjoyed the DVD tremendously. The younger generation of Black-Americans have forgotten their heritage. This DvD is a sad story of man's inhumanity to man. It also shows us the beginning of Black-Americans and some White Americans working towards justice.
4,Book vs. Movie,I really enjoyed the book but as usual the movie cannot capture the feelings and thoughts of the characters. Otherwise the movie was fair.
1,Makes Plan 9 look like Gone with the wind,"I rented this movie(if thats what you want to call it) years ago because of the actors. I've never laughed so hard watching anything like this in my entire life. Words like laughable, unbelievable, putrid, horrible come to mind every time I think about this turkey. Even Ed Wood would have been embarressed. Don't buy it, you should be paid to take it!"
4,Balsamic Glaze,The viscosity of this allows the must uncreative chef to decorate a plate making any dish look as if created by a pro. And tasty too!!!
3,I was hoping for something more informative and entertaining,"Joe's book was eloquently written. Near the end of it he discussed racial issues, some of which were quite valid. Joe took it to another level, where, in my opinion, he was reading racial discrimination into just about everything associated with black players. I saw paranoia in it. I found him pontificating on several issues, treating the readerin a patronizing manner. I had hope for something better, more humourous, because baseball is, after all, a ""Game"". It's not desert storm, the Vietnam War, world poverty and/or peace."
5,Music Revisited,"Occasionally it is difficult to listen to songs you love done buy other than the original artist. However, it is a revelation to hear a song you think you may have liked being done by someone who is really performing the song. I bought this CD without knowing very much about Michael Ball and came away looking for more. Words are very important to me and he made each song feel like an individual story. My Heart Will Go On soars to become an antham to hope and the continuation of love. Hot Stuff and People Are Strange are both fun to listen to. Love on the Rocks was surprisingly wonderful (I thought I would have chosen Neil Diamond). Wind Beneath My Wings has always been a favorite, but until now I have not had a verson in my collection. This was worth the wait. I want very much to listen to more from this person with this exceptional voice."
4,BUY IT!!!!!!!,"This is the third Michael Ball cd that I got, and it grows on you. ""I Believe I Can Fly"" is absolutely beautiful. His versions of ""My Heart Will Go On"" and ""Because You Loved Me"" are amazing. The power in his voice fits these songs perfectly. I could easily do without some of the song selections, but like I said, it will grow on you!!! Also, ""Blues Brothers Medley"" is VERY FUN!! The good tracks on this album outweigh the not so hot ones. BUY IT!!!!"
1,"Bad, bad, bad","Michael Ball used to be full of such potential, but I don't know what happened to him. His taste in material is atrocious, he's developed a weird, lounge-lizard style of singing and he oversings practically everything he touches these days. This album is no exception, with absolutely horrible versions of ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" being the worst offenders. The production is also unimaginative, sounding as if the whole album was thrown together in one day. Stay away from this disc!"
4,bratz,I purchased this item for my granddaughter and she enjoyed the movie very much. Not only did we receive the DVD but we also received a free viewing of the entire movie on the computer.
5,Super Babyz to the rescue,"This is cute like the babyz always are!!!! Cloe, Yasmin, Sasha and Jade are the cutest babyz ever!!!!!"
4,"Very funny, but few bonus features","The shows are great, but there are no commentaries and the bonus features are limited. Well worth the money even if you're not a geek."
3,a little hiccup,It took awhile to get to me and when I got it the snaps that hold the discs in were broken. Otherwise its great!
2,"Great show content, quality of video is poor",Love the show as always. The video and audio don't quite match up. video quality is pretty poor as well.
3,Very happy,Was a great gift for a friend who loves this show. Awesome job with the delivery and timing it was received as well.
1,The fake laughs drove me crazy,"Why does every new comedy that comes out have fake laughing in them? There is nothing worse than trying to watch a show that includes fake laughter at almost every sentence, funny or not. I honestly couldn't tell you if the show will make it because after listening to five solid min of fake laughter I had to delete the show."
1,very poor show,"probably won't last till Thanksgiving. Sick, very unfunny jokes, with laugh tracks to boot. Won't watch again."
1,Extremely Bad,The humor in this show is that of two and 1/2 man ; yet again another huge show with corny everybody loves raymond lines. I am shocked on why people think this is good. Horrible actors and cheesy lines the entire show. Im sure when I'm 48 and dont go outside i'll like this show but im not! Please save your money and time if your a How I met your mother fan because this show falls extreme short of good.
3,just fine,"the first cd is nos good, the first chapter of the series its nop in good shape, i cant watch the first chapter of the dvd, im a few sad about that"
5,BIg Bang Theory.....gotta love it!,I thorouly enjoy The Big Bang Theory. The cast is perfect. Sheldon is amazing and well in touch his charactor. He delivers his lines with such humor and sarcasim. Lenny's comments to Sheldon hits the nail on the head.
5,Awesome Series!,I love the big bang theory and this first season was hilarious and my whole family is addicted to this show.
5,Great Series!!,This is a great series and It is different from anything that is on TV these days and i like that about this series!
5,Very funny,"first, quality of the download is good, not HD mind you, but good. The show itself, I love the characters, laugh out loud funny, and not really written for the 'realty show' crowd. Intelligent comedy = 5 stars"
4,Really enjoyable show!!!,i really love this show! The main characters have wonderful chemistry and the writers are genius! i enjoyed the first season the most but the others are good as well. i would recommend this show for those who love a good comedy
5,Awesome!,I love this show! I just discovered it this year and I've been catching up on the all the reruns. The whole cast gels perfectly and the writing is brilliant. I think I'd like to start purchasing the series collections. It's one of my top three favorite shows now.
5,THE BEST,"JUST WATCH IT!!! ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS ON TV TODAY! EVERY CHARACTER IS THE BEST, BUT SHELDON DOES STEAL THE SHOW!"
5,Funniest Show Ever,I didn't watch season 1 or 2 on TV - but my son convinced me to watch and I had to go back and buy seasons 1 & 2 because it was so funny! After I watched I sent to my parents house and made them watch it! Totally worth the price - we will watch these DVD's over and over again!
2,Not my cup of tea,"The show is great, its just not the style of show I like. I'm sure that other probably like it and there is a lot of wit. Just not for me. Completely personal preference."
5,GREAT show about GEEK life.,"Ok, I only caught this show half way threw it's first season and have now seen all of season 1. I love, love, love, this show. As a 40 year old gay GEEK male. I have always had a twisted sense of humor. This show hit's my kind of humor perfect. I am part of these guys are, in the way they act and the things the find funy. I love to see there interaction between ""NORMAL"" people, which makes for a very funny show.I want me a replica HG Wells Time Machine. LOL!!!"
2,Shoot whoever did the laugh track!!,"OMG, Whoever did the laugh track for this show has no clue how to do their job. Laugh tracks suck in general, but this one made the show painful to watch. Could it be likable? Sure, but not with that laugh track! We have put it in as a season's pass and will see how it goes before we start watching it. This one may not last long, but as a nerd, I find it has potential. EDIT: We actually ended up loving this show. I hope it returns after the strike. Being a nerd who works at a University, this show hits home... yes I know these people..!"
5,The Big Bang Theory,This is a must have in anyones collection. Hilarious! Great gift for the hard to buy for. Want all of them.
5,Beter on DVD,"I love the Big Bang Theory, but seldom get a chance to watch it or tape the show. This was the first time I purchased a complete season of a television show...it was great, no commercials and I was able to get a handle on the characters as they developed. Looking forward to season 2."
5,Another HIT from Chuck Lorre,"The Big Bang Theory is a funny, well-written, expertly acted sitcom. Chuck Lorre has created another hit show that goes beyond standard formula comedy. As in Two and A Half Men, his characters and their stories give the fans a lot to love. The entire cast definitely deserve an ensemble Emmy Award! Thank you Mr. Lorre and please know we DO read your vanity cards!!"
4,The Big Bang Theory Season 1 - DVD Review,"+ Flat box (very convenient).+ Large amount of subtitles.- Lack of bonus (interviews, behind the scene, etc...)."
5,my absolute favorite,"The thing that endears me to this show is that I have known guys just exactly like the ones depicted here. The writers must have too for they have the characters down flawlessly. Sheldon is, of course, my favorite and I want so much to be annoyed by him but I just can't, you have to love him. That, I think, is the whole appeal of the show. You want to be annoyed by these guys but you cant. All you can do is sit and watch and laugh out loud. In a time when there is so much stupid comedy, this is intelligent writing. I hope it has a long run and I will definitely be watching every episode."
5,The Big Bang Theory,A great television series and well worth the price. This team of actors works very well together to come up with a great plot of fun and comedy. A must for fans of the show.
3,It was ok,"The show it self is one the the funniest ive seen. The only beef I have with this season is, the video quality was painful for the first few episodes."
3,Irritated and Annoyed,This is like the second time I've ordered something from Amazon and gotten something totally different. I ordered this Complete Edition of Big Bang Theory and I'll be darn if my first CD in Season one isn't GLEE. Why? I can't stand GLEE too much singing. Since I've already opened the package I guess there is no need for me to send it back. I think I'm going to stop ordering from Amazon. Usually I'm pretty content but I'm just irritated right now.
5,The Big Bang Theory - Complete First Season,"The Big Bang Theory is one of the sharpest and wittiest television shows to come along in a great while. The five main characters play off one another to perfection. The collection is especially entertaining to watch as there are no commercials to break the flow of the show. A definite ""must have"" for geek lovers!!"
4,A Great Show,This show is hilarious and contrary to popular belief you do not have to have a PhD in physics to get all the intellectual humor. Shelton and Leonard are the funniest comedy team since Andy and Barney. This is a must see series
4,Love the Series,"The series itself is topnotch which is why I give it 4 stars but the box set is limited with additional stuff. Don't expect to buy this set and get all kinds of additional features, it's mainly just the episodes. Very funny series though."
4,Big Bang Theory,I love this show! It's great having it on DVD without having to sit through commercials!
5,Can't quit watching,"I can neither quit watching this show nor can wait till the season 2 comes out. The first two episodes in the season 1 are rather on a sleeper side, however, once Leonard suddenly becomes a ""magnificent beast"" and Howard, with his meager luck, briefly cohabits with a hoer from the Babylon (both episodes involving their real sleeping), you can no longer stop watching the show. I watched each season 1 episode at least 4 times. Ranking the season 1 episodes was easy at first but the order kept changing somewhat upon every round of my viewership. According to my self-centered verdict, the Physics Ball episode was the funniest sitcom that I'd seen in a long time."
3,The Best Show Ever,"This is the best show ever. I love the characters, they are all great. I am laughing so much I'm not sure it's good for me. They're not just scientists they're nut cases. It's great watching."
3,No Extra Features; just the DVD!,"Great show, but one normally buys DVDs to see the special features, commentary, behind the scenes, etc. In fact, the DVD didn't even come with a pamphlet (outlining the episodes of the season). All in all, not the greatest DVD set I've purchased."
3,Great show but annoying canned laughter,If you are a geek you will probably love if show. The canned laughter however may drive you nuts. I would buy this series in a second if there was no canned laughter. My favorite sitcoms are my favorite because they have no canned laughter. A good sitcom with good writers will not need the laughter track and The Big Band Theory has all that but they still added the annoying canned laughter. The show would get 5 stars without the laughter track.
3,Has potential,"Had some very funny parts, also had some slow parts. Not sure if this will last, but is worth watching a couple of episodes if nothing esle is on."
3,Great,"I love the pop culture references in this show - especially the sci-fi ones. A must for any ""geek"" lover."
3,Big Bang? Or Big Bust?,"I wasn't too impressed with the first season of The Big Bang Theory. I will buy the second series though because I've watched it on television and it was much funnier than this season. This DVD set kind of sets up what's to come with this crazy threesome (later fivesome with the addition of their other oddball friends). I'd recommend you buy this DVD if you're a big fan of the show. Otherwise, wait til it comes down in price."
1,Freezes,Now he tells me! Apparently the disc freezes. Had he told me sooner I could have returned it.
1,Not happy,"I ordered this and a book for friend's birthday. I qualified for super saver shipping, but when I had the products sent separately, I lost that. I think that's kind of cheap - I was still charged the same amount for the items. Also, the Big Bang Theory has not yet been received, and we are talking over 4 weeks later.I love the item, (we own it), not happy at all with the service."
4,Made me laugh out loud a few times,"The show isn't perfect - pilots are usually rather awkward - but I thought the writing was pretty good (a number of the geek sterotypes were right-on) and the 2 lead guys did a great job. I had several laugh out loud moments. The girl needs to be less dumb, and I didn't care for the 2 accessory geek friends. But, I think this show has potential."
4,"Fairly funny, even though there's a laugh track.","This series reminds me of the dynamic that my high school friends shared. Great scripting, and overall a funny experience."
5,Great show,We haven't completed the whole first season yet. It is great to see how it all started. Smart and funny. We love it
5,FUNNY STUFF,Roll on the floor laughing adult comedy. Add just enough human warmth for season and you get hugely entertaining television!Talented writing plus talented actors plus perfect execution equals a hit show.Ten stars **********More! More!
5,Comic genius,Not since the days of Seinfeld and Arrested Development have I laughed this hard and long over a sitcom. The Big Bang Theory is a spectacularly written show and the chemistry between the characters is absolutely hilarious. I was so happy to hear that it had been signed for 2 more seasons. I cannot get enough.
5,Must Have Season,"I love this show, I have all four season and laugh with each show. This is a must for anyone that wants to chase the daily blues away."
5,big bang theory 1st season,Love this show and bought it for a friend for his birthday and he thinks it's great. can't wait to get the others.
5,Perfect!,Where it all began! Got the entire set for a gift and absolutely LOVE IT! This show is hilarious...hour and hours of laughter and fun!
5,Must have for Bangers.,"If you've seen the show you know how funny it is.Here's where it all began, and it's a must-have for true fans.It just doesn't get old."
5,Awesome.,"I was very pleased to find this item on lightning deals. I purchased all 5 available seasons for my fiance because she loves the show. Typical dvd packaging, well organized discs."
5,laughter any time,Missed the first few seasons. Totaly enjoyed catching up on the gang and having the seasons on hand for my own marathon . The show makes me laughout loud.
5,"Very funny, smart and original comedy","A friend recommended this show to me that I had never heard of, and showed me the first episode. I was immediately hooked. The show is smart and hilarious - I can honestly say it made me laugh until I cried. The humor is intelligent (the physics jokes and references throughout the show are all completely accurate, too - they had a physicist on the board for the show.) The cast is unbelievable - Jim Parsons (Sheldon) and Johnny Galecki (Leonard) in particular. Poor Leonard is adorable in the way he is smitten with Penny and Sheldon just plain steals the show. Kaley Cuoco (Penny), Kunal Nayyar (Raj), Simon Helberg (Howard) and Sara Gilbert (Leslie) make up the rest of the cast, and are just as fantastic. There is not enough good I can possible say about the writing - just spectacular. Not many extras on the DVD - some deleted scenes, and a couple featurettes. Rating: 6 stars our of 5."
5,"Big Bang, Big Laughs",My friend got me hooked on this show and there are few shows that compare to the hilarity and truth of this storyline! A brilliant idea created by brilliant writers. I highly recommend watching the seasons!
1,Ha. Why isn't this free streaming.,And you wonder why netflix is winning. I will never pay for crap like this. You are insane and greedy.
1,Had me smiling once,"I only (briefly) smiled once while watching the show.First of all the characters are hardly believable and even if you accept that they have been exaggerated for the sake of the show, the nerds/geeks jokes have all been seen/heard before.Oh, and as everybody said before, the laugh track is just terrible and makes it even more difficult to watch this show through the end."
5,This is a real hot hooting laugh!,Oh boy this is a real hot hooting laugh and loads of fun! To geek or not to geek? One must geek! Lol I am saying I cannot love this comedy more.
4,Funny Show,Me and my hubby like to watch this show and since he's gone on the nights that it's now on I love that we have the whole season and we can catch up on it together.
5,Big Bang it is,"I watched the season 1 DVDs only now - and it is hilarious. Whether you are a geek or not, you understand science or not, you'll enjoy this. Jim Parsons as Sheldon is excellent and the mainstay. Hang on to every word that comes out of his mouth - or you'll miss a smart joke. Johnny Galecki, as Leonard is supposedly the ""one resembling us ordinary folks"". Kunal Nayyar as Brajesh plays the Indian who's tongue tied in front of women. Simon Helbert as Howard is the obnoxious little nerd whom women hate. Kaley Cuoco as Penny who does not 'dig' the geeks.The whole show is a unique concept and you'll find fresh humor that is not a rehash of old beaten hollywood writing. Very funny."
5,Fabulous!!,We love Big Bang Theory and watch it frequently! It is very funny and appeals to the nerd in me.
5,Funniest Geeks Ever!,"I first started watching The Big Bang Theory about 4 months ago. Now, I can't stop! The sarcasm and wit crack me up. I purchased the first season to watch on my Kindle during a long flight to Peru. I got some odd looks as I laughed out loud at Sheldon's little ""laugh"", Rajesh's ""disability"", and Howard's creepiness. Watch this show and get hooked; I highly recommend it!!!"
4,"5 Star Show, 3 Star DVD Set","Once in a while you watch a television show and, within five minutes, know that the writers ""get it"". This is one of those shows. From the first episode, the cast clicked, the writing worked, and it was a blast to watch. I've watched each episode on this set several times, and I still find I'm laughing out loud.Now the bad news...The DVD set has no extras, and their absence makes a difference. Would it be that hard to shoot a few ""get to know the actors"" bonus features? How about commentary on at least the pilot? Or even a few words from Chuck Lorre about his title cards? Nope. Not here. You'd think a show about the kind of geeks that get into DVD bonus features would include bonus features on the DVD.But the show itself is great. Buy a copy.EDIT: So much for my credibility. I just realized there is one extra, a short called ""Quantum Mechanics of the Big Bang Theory. A Behind-the-Scenes Look Into Geek Chic."" But I still would have liked some commentary tracks!"
4,Mixed Emotions,"The Big Bang Theory is, by turns, great and awful.Great: The geek humor of the show is funny and includes some semi-obscure geek references, but it is by no means a show that will go over viewers heads. The actors are charming -- particularly Johnny Galecki as Leonard, which most of us remember as David on Roseanne (I loved him even then!), and Jim Parsons as Sheldon, the socially-inept, uber-geek.Awful: Penny (played by Kaley Cuoco) is a dumb bimbo. She seemingly lacks any capacity to understand most of what the guys are saying, and worse yet, she doesn't care. Most of the time, she parades around in absurdly skimpy clothing, choosing to use her body rather than her mind. I think Penny is there, ideally, to balance out the awkwardness of the guys, but instead of providing a balance, she just seems like a dumb blonde.My reservations aside, I enjoyed this show enough to buy it. The female roles in this show are atrocious, but the male ones are funny and lovable."
3,The big bang--whimper,"Very uneven performances. Leonard, who is the 'straight man' of the comedy team impressed me much more than Sheldon as an actor. Sheldon is a caricature of all the nerd-genius--relationship negative characters who ever performed in any media.Penny is believable and enjoyable.The later episodes did improve, so I will probably buy future seasons."
2,laugh track ruined it for me,"I can't remember the last show I watched with a laugh track - they're intrusive, annoying, and detract from the show. I made it about 15 minutes into the show before I had to turn it off.The show itself has some potential. The casting, acting, and set are all good. The writing leaves something to be desired, but there were some good moments. As another reviewer pointed out, it seems like some hack writer took random ""geek"" words and used them slightly wrong - instead of being written by a true geek, it comes across written by someone who is trying to imagine him/herself as a geek.Overall, I think it'd grow on me if they took out the laugh track. Here's hoping the network reads these reviews before broadcasting the pilot."
2,Not good. Gets old quick,"From the trailers I thought the concept for this show would be good, but even if you have a science/engineering/math background and get the jokes, they still are not very funny. I watched this show for 22 minutes and that was about as much as I could take. I can't see how this show will last past a few episodes. About the only laughs you will get from this show are the ones you hear coming from the awful laugh track.I hope this is not indicative of the new shows being released this fall... if it is were all doomed."
2,NOT BLU RAY!!!! NOT HD & TERRIBLE QUALITY,These DVDs are terrible quality! I started watching mine and could see all the pixels on first DVD. After that it was fine but now I have to hassle them to replace this item.
2,Appeared to be bootlegged,"The disc that was received played well and came in a timely fashion, but looked to be burnt and the cover appeared to be a home print job. Possibly bootlegged, but item was listed as original disc."
2,WHERE'S THE HUMOR?,Where's the humor? I get this is a popular show and several people told me they liked it but it totally fell flat for me. I suffered through one episode and then tossed the DVD into a black hole. HUMOR: D minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: D plus to C minus; WHEN WATCHED: 02/08/2011.
2,No High Definition?,"This is not a review of the show, which I love. But it's very disappointing to watch the show in HDTV, and then find out that the DVD is only being offered in standard definition. Why no Blu-ray? The DVD should provide a better watching experience than watching it on broadcast network, and in this case it doesn't.Please, Warner, bring out your high-def television shows on high-def DVD."
5,Funniest Sitcom ever!,It is said that laughter is the best medicine. Every episode of this show will heal the worst illnesses! This comedy gives a whole new meaning to LAUGHING OUT LOUD!
4,OMG - I dated one of these guys!,"This quirky little show is a little to close to reality for me to appreciate the humor. While everyone else in the room is roaring - I'm twitching with unease because I think I dated Sheldon. Not the star but a real character who, in my reality, was actually named ""Sheldon""! I thought brainiacs were sexy - NO - they are just guys who's brains have outgrown their heads. The funniest part in this show is the overt discomfort that is evident in these guys when they find themselves in everyday situations surrounded by dumb folk like you and me. My favorite episode was when Sheldon got the flu and became the center of the universe (unto himself) and the great effort his friends went to in order to avoid him during his illness. I think this was the show when I mixed up the TV Sheldon with my Sheldon, another whiney hypocondriac. Oh lord - I'm so confused.Bottom line - this is a funny funny show and well worth the price...bg"
5,"Finally, a smart very funny sitcom.","It's been way too long since a sitcom made me laugh at every episode. It doesn't take a genius to figure out the humor. And the casting is perfect and the acting flawless. I'm looking forward to every episode. Keep em coming, please. I'm addicted. Big kudos to the writers for this show. I am very, very grateful that such talent is being used so well."
5,funniest new show..I laughed right out loud,"This is a wonderful new show with a great cast of characters and wonderful story lines. The comedy is ""laugh right out loud"" funny...something we all could use these days, when not much else is funny in our lives. Don't miss it!!"
4,Great writing,"Great writing and casting. This is a smart and funny show that is held back by a loud and obnoxious laugh track. Keep the acting, keep the writing but lose the laugh track."
5,awesome series,This is an amazing show!! I bought the first 3 seasons. It provided tons of fun and laughter. The DVDs arrived earlier than expected. I ordered the set during the Christmas holiday. Must buy!!!
4,"Great Show, But...","I'm loving the show and plan to buy future seasons, but is the standard definition glossy looking, or is it just me? I'll be buying the HD versions from now on."
5,good fun,It is a great show and i cant wait to get season 2 on dvd I try and catch every episode on tv and I really like the packaging it was perfect.
5,Just what the doctor ordered.,"Was down sick in bed, feeling low. Watched the whole season, back to back. Laughter is indeed the best medicine!Great ensemble cast. Looking forward to the next 5 seasons."
5,Christmas gift,Ordered this for my son for Christmas. He really likes it. Will order Season 2 for his birthday gift later.
5,Great show,Wonderful show. Lots of laughter. So funny. Even great to watch again and again. Great writers. Wonderful actors.Arrived quickly.
4,The Big Bang Theory....Best show ever,These DVDs of The Big Bang Theory are awesome.They are a reminder that there still original and intelligent shows out there.
5,only funny new sitcom of the season,"Yes, you read correctly. ""The Big Bang Theory"" was the only funny new sitcom of the 2007-08 viewing season. The pickings have been that slim of late. The writing is whipsmart, the storylines entertaining, the acting by the principals note perfect, and Jim Parsons' Sheldon is a comedic creation for the ages. It also doesn't hurt that Kaley Cuoco is easy on the eyes. Watch this one, people. That's an order!"
5,Big bang. Theory!! Awesome,"Big bang Theory Is Awesome ! Great cast. Wonderful script. It Just gets better and Better! Amazon.com. :Prompt Delivery, Great Communication regarding Order!!!"
3,Probably not worth the money,"Well, to begin with, for a book that has ""...programming in C..."" in the title, there is very little C code in the text-- most is pseudocode. Most of the book is an analysis of various parallel algorithms, with very little instruction on how to use MPI. There are much better resources out there for learning MPI, as Quinn only covers about 30 of the over 100 functions in MPI, without all that much detail. Some of extremely important and necessary concepts of parallel programming are only mentioned in passing...such as load balancing. Most of the applications (with the exception of matrix operations) are simple and basic to the point of making me wonder why you would even bother parallelizing them...even as a pedagogical tool. The book does a very good job of analyzing algorithms, but calling it an ""introduction to MPI"" or even an ""introduction to parallel programming"" textbook is incorrect."
2,"Over-priced, under-delivered","If you're looking for a textbook for a class on parallel programming, this may be for you, but I wouldn't know. If you're trying to figure out MPI to actually write some code, this one definitely isn't for you. Get Pacheco's book instead. Half the price, too.Basically, there is very little tutorial-style programming coverage in here, more design and analysis of parallel algorithms. The majority of MPI function calls is not even covered in detail, but only listed in the appendix. Give me a break."
4,Pond Puckster,"Pond Puckster was a very good and exciting book. It was a very exciting book to read. It also has an interesting plotline, of a rich boy having to move to a rugged town in Maine for a Winter, with no indoor hockey rink within 50 miles.One more reason I liked it was because I am about the same age as the kid and I could kind of relate with him. Overall, I think that Pond Puckster was a very good book."
2,Noisy Little Thing,This USB fan is quite noisy and hardly blows any wind. Put your palm 3-4 inches away from your face and whistle. That is about the wind you get from this fan when it is up close. Its coil is also not very strong and cannot hold the weight of the fan head well.
5,"I like it, it works, and hasn't broken on me yet...","Came as ordered, in time specified and works just great. I like how it has soft blades because it lowers the chances of it breaking in my back-pack. Great for people at school who get a little warm in the computer lab."
3,"A technique, not a strategy","NLP will help you sell, and it may close a particular sale. It won't work everywhere with everyone. In my opinion, while it has some value, the zealots have overhyped NLP. ""The Unfair Advantage: Sell with NLP!"" has a weak binding, so that pages literally falls from the book as you turn them."
1,Not much about NLP,Covered only some very basic NLP concepts. You may find it interesting if you are completely new to NLP; otherwise not very useful.
3,Tricks with this player,"Well, it turns out that there are many nifty features to this DVD player. First, I think the remote is annoyingly small, and it's hard to find a battery for it. But guess what, the remote for my old Philips DVD player works on it as well. Also, you can convert it into a region free DVD player by opening the lit when you turn it on, and punching in 9,9,9,9,0Region 0, which is region free, should pop up.THEN, you have to press system menu or setup, go to the video setup menu and change the TV setting from MULTI to NTSB. For some reason, if the setting is in MULTI, it won't play the DVDs from outside of the US region. It's really weird, but after messing with it for ages, I found that the NTSB setting and the region 0 code work together to give you perfect picture for any DVD in the US."

3,if interested in this topic,"Guggenheimer gives a good introduction to the topic, although a good background in mathematics (analysis) is very helpful. While not one of the easiest books to read, it serves as a good supplemental text to anyone browsing through other texts on differential geometry."
4,Math is not my native tongue,"I'm a chemist by education, but i did take some abstract math classes in school. I try to extend my knowledge of mathematics as I can, and Dover books are cheap, but can be a mixed bag. Some are just weird and hard to follow.I have not gone through this whole book yet, but I like what I have seen so far. It helps to have some familiarity with 'math talk' like what you pick up in abstract algebra or an analysis class. But if you have the basic chops one would get as an engineering or science student, ie you know some calculus and linear algebra, this book and your favorite search engine will teach a person some differential geometry."
1,More lies from Hollywood's most infamous fabricator,"Really, why do people buy Boze Hadleigh's trash anymore? It's all lies, it's all conveniently ""quoted"" (read: fabricated) from dead people, and it's all transparent nonsense cooked up for sensationalistic purposes."
1,Randolph Scott and Cary Grant were Friends nothing more,The photo you are talking about is a movie promo picture. It's from the movie My Favorite Wife. Them living together was when they were young and up and coming actors. this book is just making money off of dead people who are not around to defend there good names. This book is utter crap.
4,Terrifying reading,"I found this collection of closety interviews fascinating -- and at times frightening. Particularly self-deluded and scary is Tony Perkins's bizarre conversation with Hadleigh. What a weirdo! Perkins can't seem to answer a question directly or honestly. Which is what made Charles Winecoff's biography of Perkins, SPLIT IMAGE, so disturbing -- the depths to which self-hate and fear can push a person. This is recommended reading."
1,Idiot's Delight,"This is one of the most ridiculous books that has ever been passed off as ""nonfiction"". Supposedingly, these veteran stars all couldn't wait to tell all to some minor writer. You might notice that there isn't a single picture of the author with any of the stars, yet he amazingly has detailed conversations with them, including someone like Randolph Scott who never gave any interviews the last thirty plus years of his life!! Also note how unbelievable the dialogue is and how each star's ""voice"" sounds much like the other, all are vagueish about their own sex life but can't wait to dish about everybody else. Possibly all of the people profiled (I can't bring myself to say interviewed) were gay or bisexual but if you believe these ""interviews"" I have a Brooklyn Bridge I would like to sell you at a nice price."
3,Questionable...at best,"Though entertaining, I feel this book should be considered just that. Unconvincing dialogue flows rampantly. Don't take this too seriously...REALLY."
3,Very small,this was a little tight for two good sized people but it served it's purpose and for a good price.
2,ripped up tarp,"I used the Texsport Knollwood Bivy Shelter Tent when I went hiking in the cold mountains of France. When it arrived I was disappointed, a cheap looking Shelter if there ever was one. I took it anyways, paying the price later when it rained heavily. All though I had a good sleeping bag, the Shelter tore instantly in cold wind, the stakes snapped and rips were everywhere. By day 5 it was just a ripped up tarp and I had to sleep in my good sleeping bag during the cold rain storm. Invest in a good three-season tent for $200 - $500."
2,Broke the first time I used it.,"This was basically a one-use item for me, since the flexible rod which supports the smaller end of the tent split like green wood the first time I used it. I may get one more use out of it, but with the rod split, it was a little wobbly."
3,"Light, cheap, get what you pay for LEAKS","Worked fine in dry weather. In a heavy downpour for 1 hour is soaked right through the fabric and polled on the bottom for the tent. this of course, after seam sealing. Its 3 lbs though so great for backpacking. TONS of room for one +gear+dog. For two its ""cozy"" and have little room for gear, definitely not a dog! If you just need something light for a backpacking trip where you'll have shelter from rain or no heavy rain is expected you'll be fine, if not, hope you have a synthetic sleeping bag b/c down doesn't insulate when wet!"
3,Good info but over-rated,"Guerrilla Marketing is a book filled with good information, but a lot of common sense info. The series is over-rated."
3,Poor Layout,"I am very disappointed with the small type and lack of space in this edition. There is no space for notes and I am looking for a micro highlighter. A good example of why I am thinking of going to E books. I use these books with clients and it is important for them to have spaces for notes, etc."
4,Victorinox Knife,Knife is very solid and stable in my hand. Quality is excellent. Cuts solid items well. Excellent value for the money.
5,great for college,"i'm a college student, and well, it's basically impossible to cook w/o a knife. after looking at reviews i decided to get this knife. (i also happen to buy ratatouille the dvd at the same time, fun coincidence) anyways, it's pretty sharp. which means easier and faster chopping, less time cooking, and more time studying.the handle seems mediocre, it's not fancy, just a basic plastic handle.anyways, for my purposes this knife was perfect. it's cheap and it cuts well."
4,Great knife for the money,"One of my favorite knives in the kitchen... holds an edge well, weighted well, comfortable, and a great value."
2,A mediocre sequel to an outstanding masterpiece,"""Blue Moon Rising"" is one of the greatest fantasy books ever, a true masterpiece. Of course I was very excited when I heard about it being continued. I was anxiously awaiting the sequel and ordered it the day it came out.Well, I was in for a disappointment. While the beginning of the book is pretty good, it's rather another Hawk & Fisher book and doesn't have much to do with ""Blue Moon Rising"". And from the point the plot leaves Haven, things are going downslope. The remaining 3/4 of the book is plain mediocre. While it was certainly not boring and it was mostly enjoyable read, it never lives up to its promise to deliver a worthy sequel to ""Blue Moon Rising"".If you're a big fan of Simon R. Green and/or ""Blue Moon Rising"" (like I am), get this book. Else, it might not be worth the hassle.While ""Beyond the Blue Moon"" is certainly better than the overstretched Deathstalker series, it's way behind all other fantasy books Mr. Green wrote this far."
3,Chocolate Chip Cookies,"Okay, I'm a serious Simon Green fan. ""Blue Moon Rising"" is one of my all time favorites, and I was sorry when he went from writing great Fantasy to writing bad Sci-Fi. So I was really excited to see this sequel, the excitement didn't last. In order to explain this I came up with the following analogy: ""Beyond.."" is comparable to the basic Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookie- worth eating but not very exciting, while the Hawk and Fisher series rates the more satisfying Chunky Chips Ahoy.. definitely enjoyable. The original ""Blue Moon Rising"" would be similar to my home baked cookies.. serious pleasure.. :-) So go ahead and read it, paperbacks aren't a huge investment (although they're getting close), but don't expect a burst of pleasure. Mr. Green has left the room.. :-("
1,Blergh...,"The heading says it all really... I have read and reread blue moon rising more times than i can count, and would easily call it one of my favourite novels. Naturally, i was excited when i heard of the coming sequel, and rushed to read it when it came out. I was bitterly disappointed. It was like a rushed effort to get all the characters together for a badly thought out adventure that ends like a bad scooby doo movie. Properly done, this could have been a great novel and it had some great ideas. As it is, i almost felt like weeping from disappointment when it was over. Avoid at all costs."
2,Novel ruined by bad grammar - again.,"Someone needs to inform Mr. Green that sentence fragments are not a stylistic device, they are just bad grammar. There are so many sentence fragments that it made the book very hard to read. I counted 4 in one paragraph, and the longest distance without a fragment was a page and a half."
4,You'll never please everyone,"But in this case, the only thing that did not please me about ""Beyond the Blue Moon"" was that it ended. I've heard a lot of praise for ""Blue moon Rising"", the prequel to the Hawk and Fisher series, but I came upon that book only shortly before ""Beyond the Blue Moon"". My Hawk and Fisher were in Haven and this seemed like a truly worthy send up of the two dealiest individuals in fantasy writing. My only regret is that Green isn't filling in a few more blanks in the lives of Hawk and Fisher in Haven. I honestly can't get enough of them."
3,Something of a Disappointmet,"Blue Moon Rising is my favorite book. I have read it numerous times, and have recommended it to many people. So, when I found out that Green was writing a sequel to BMR, I was ecstatic. However, this new book simply lacks the punch that the original had.I felt like Green took the easy way out in the way of character resolution, especially the dragon, the goblins and the high warlock. I could see how the plot resolved a mile away.There were some interesting new elements in this book, but the writing style is just not up to par with Blue Moon Rising. Blue Moon Rising is snappy and funny at times, with a healthy dose of adventure. Beyond the Blue Moon gets somewhat trite.I would recommed it only because it is something of a resolution of Blue Moon Rising, but I was still rather disappointed."
5,L.A. Punk Godhead,"Probably the biggest American Punk band over here is definately The Rotters. All this time I thought they were something huge over in America like Bad religion or NOFX. But I find out this isn't true. Most probably the most important American Punk record ever made, the Rotters have it all and LESS! Why Repo-Man didn't use The Rotters in their soundtrack is still a mystery. According to Alex Cox ""...they refused to return my calls..."" Hard to believe. This record is a must. Actually, I've bought it more times than I care to admit."
5,This Book Rocks!,"This simply one of the best books I have ever read. The story is enchanting, and the charaters flow and mesh together like a song. Walker is put under a magnifying glass in this book, and we see more of the real him. I think that this is one of the best in the series, and I reccomend this book ONLY if you have read the Scions of Shannara. If you have, read it today!"
4,All about the Druid!,Length:: 1:10 MinsInteresting to see one man's journey becoming something he always denied. I loved the focus on the mysterious druids.. and their system of magic
5,I loved this one,"All the Shannara books are good reads and very entertaining, but this is one of, if not my favorite. The story of Walker Boh has so many dark nuances, so much internal conflict, that to read it is almost refreshing. The story isn't simple, there isn't just a hero, there is confusion and anger and irony. It truly is a great book, and as always, Brooks has created an almost tangible world for the reader."
5,diffenitly the best,"I have read all but one of the Shannara books, and I really think that this was the best of them all. I really liked the mysterious and rather dark personality of Walker Boh and I was kept interested throught he whole thing. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down!"
4,Almost a five star...,"This was the first book by Terry Brooks I had ever read. I started reading it but couldn't finish it after they entered Elwist. I had never not finished a book so I forced my self to finish it. And I was plesently surpised. The plot everntualy picked up and in the end turned out to be a very good book. Since then I've read all the Heritage of Shannara books and I really liked the series. I am currently reading The Elfstones Of Shannara, it also is a really good book. The only thing keeping The Druid if Shannara from being 5 stars is the middle, but if you can make it through it the ending is worth it. Just have a box of tissues ready!"
5,Absorbing Story,"This book is part two in a series of three books written by Terry Brooks. Based in the world of Shannara that the first series, Sword of Shannara created, this trio of books is just as interesting. It concerns the rise of evil in the world again and focuses on the descendants of the first group of characters, all that is left of the family able to weild the spellsong. It is set about 300 years later. I have the first and second books, and am ordering the third tonight. Hope it comes quickly!"
5,Another future classic from Terry Brooks.,"Northwest author Terry Brooks throws another strike with the second installment in his Heritage of Shannara series. Characters were deep and emotional, and I especially enjoyed Brooks' ability to constantly take the reader into the mind of each of them to give him/her a first-hand perspective of how each of the characters thinks and feels. I think that Brooks is the first truly great fantasy author of our time, and his books are a must read for anyone interested in the fantasy genre. I also liked how Brooks did not limit himself to what he saw on the map in the front of the book. The one problem I had with the book was the slight lack of plot turns. Having read all of Brooks' previous titles, I found the way the storyline moved to be a little too much like some of his previous work. I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in a fast-paced, fun adventure book"
5,this book was outstanding and has shown what writing is,ell i really did not read this book but his others were pretty goo
3,The good story continues on...,"Worthy of a fourth star, but once you get to Talismans where all the loose ends get tied, the story totally crashes."
2,"a disappointing, mediocre, recycled junk from Terry Brooks","Terry Brooks should win the RECYCLING award, should such prize be invented. There isn't one ounce of originality in this book. All characters, creatures, locales, and plots are lukewarm rehash of his earlier (and FAR superior) efforts. Success breeds sloth, I suppose."
2,One of Terry's worst,"It saddens me to say this, as Terry is a dear friend, but I have always considered this one of his worst works. Skip this one and buy one of my books instead."
1,Poor audio mix...,"The same audio mixing problem as 2007 review. You hear the commentators gettting excited, but you can't feel why because the sound from the engines are so low in the mix it becomes a bore to watch after, oooh, about 5 secs. If you like exciting motorcycle racing DVD, get the world superbike review. Soooo much better."
2,Feeble attempt at classical mechanics text,"Drs. Barger and Olsson need to consider explaining themselves more clearly, especially when dealing with advanced mathematical topics. Simply stating ""this is a tensor"" does not adequately explain the concept. An appendix of mathematical concepts is *needed*. The standard flaw of obscure derivations is included, often skipping steps or presupposing knowledge of advanced mathematics. In addition Drs. Barger and Olsson need to adopt innovations used by better textbooks, such as problems relevant to material covered, clearly worded explanations and questions, and the example."
1,This book has too many errors,"Of all the physics books, I have seen and used, this has the most errors in it. And they arn't just typeo's, this book also has conceptual errors in it. This book also has ""unique"" and sometimes cryptic ways of proving, and presenting concepts. This apparitly apeals to Professors who already know classical mechanics, but for the first time sudent it is quite troublesome. In short if you want a book you can trust, and you can learn the first time around from, don't choose this one. It has to be the worst physics text I have had inflected on me yet at this level."
1,How to Run Away from Home After 50,"I gave it one star, if I could I would have given it zero! I have read around 10 books on fulltiming. This is far and away the worst one I have read. The author who is 67 years old, not even close to 50, describes her and her husbands little adventure traveling around the USA and Canada. If you want to know where the best chiropractors are or how meditation gets her through life then by all means buy this book. There is very little on how to retire in your 50's and go full timing. They started out in a 25ft trailer(way to small) and after about a month bought a brand new 42ft motorhome. One thing you will learn is the name of every friend she has, because they visted every single one of them and they were mentioned in her book. This is one book that once you put it down you won't be able to pick it back up. Look for books by the Steeles and Hoffmeister that are light years ahead of this book about the fulltiming lifestyle."
4,A Five Star Book with a Three Star ending,"Black Out starts off racing on all cylindars. Convincing and mysterious, atmospheric and believable. About two-thirds of the way through, the ends aren't going to get wrapped up at all easily, so Lawton has to do some shoving and twitching that requires Troy to wig out. End of book is hardly believable and so unlikely as to invite brooklyn cheers and other nasty grams. But characters hold up. Troy has a constitution suggesting influence of $9 million dollar man. But still pretty exciting if overlong and too ambitious."
3,"Atmospheric, but. . .just how accurate?","I was considering purchasing the other books in this series until I got deep into Black Out. I had questions about the historic accuracy of some of the aspects of wartime London and of the ongoing military action. But, they were just nagging questions. Then we encounter the female GI who had joined the US Army in the early 1930s. WRONG! There were no females in the US military at that time. We had a few in WWI (I was privileged to hear one of the U.S. Navy Yeomanettes who is still alive), but ""Women in the US Military"" essentially date to 1942. I should know; I spent 25 years as one. To ""blow"" such an easily checked fact makes me uncomfortable about his historic accuracy in other areas. To the author: Check your facts better!"
3,"Great atmosphere, but ...","There are just too many coincidences. Half of the cast of characters in this World War Two murder mystery seem to have direct personal connections to Detective Sergeant Troy of Scotland Yard. For me, this made the whole story too contrived. And I would criticize the sex scenes as being a bit gratuitous and unbelievable, not being quite integrated with the rest of the narrative.Although I had heard encouraging things about John Lawton's novels, this -- my first exposure to him -- let me rather disappointed. I think in the future I will stick with Alan Furst instead."
2,a lesson in futility,"With this book, I learned that there is no substitute for being taught by a professional. Don't try this at home, kids!"
5,Original part - so it fits!,"This was a direct replacement plug-in for my 2002 Pontiac Grand Am. No need to rewire anything as some of the cheaper ones here will have you do. It has the same wiring socket as the one that came off the car. The threads are already coated with a ""never-seize"" product (silver paste), so be careful not to wipe that off before installation. I highly recommend cleaning the threads with a tap before installing the new sensor. This is a highly corrosive environment and the threads will not be in pristine condition after you remove the old sensor. This is the sensor before the catalytic converter, located on my Grand Am on the rear facing exhaust manifold (V-6)."
4,Luke Vibert '- YosepH,"Luke Vibert makes the move from Mo Wax to Warp with YOSEPH. And while ""Liptones"" sounds like an angry model stomping down a catwalk, ""Freak Time Baby"" blends together acid with Vibert's love of hip-hop beats. And is that a spittake that I hear on ""Countdown""? But the sexy ""I Love Acid"" really takes the cake here. And just in case you can't get enough acid, ""Acidisco"" pours on the 303. ""Slowfast"" somehow lives up to its name, incorporating a slow beat with a frenzied acid line, while ""Snapdance"" keeps things loose and limber. ""Harmonic"" takes the album out on an electro note, keeping things, as always with Vibert, eclectic."
2,Lukewarm vibration,2 1/2Satisfyingly second-rate intelligent house music occasionally bubbles with wonderment but more often bleeps on by in its background-intensive context.
4,Yo Se Acid,"YosepH is pseudo Spanish for ""I know Acid,"" e.g. Yo se (I know) and pH (Acid)--I realized this about 1-2 years after purchasing this album, so I'm not the smartest guy on the block. This is a challenging album and I like the dance tunes the best, but I think that I've got to give it a more serious few listens.What I can say with conviction, though, is that this album contains the ingredients that separates the Boys from Cornwall from many other electronic artists for its creativity, risk, and rigor. Examine the verve of the title and its implication for anyone interested in Acid music-this is probably a must have for them. Give it a shot."
3,Good but not great,"Luke Vibert has many different styles of music. Wagon Christ with the ambient instrumental hip-hop, Plug with the Drum 'n' Bass, Amen Andrews with the jungle, and Like Vibert with everything else. Every Luke Vibert album has sounded sort of the same, with the exception of YosepH. YosepH is a blend of fast breaks and 303 Acid Techno. The problem is this album doesnt have the sweet melody's and heavenly breaks like his other albums. YosepH is filled with synth lines and acid melodies. Can get a little repetitive and annoying. I recommend sampling a song before you purchase it."
1,THis GUy is CRap,"Ok, after making an amazing album with B.J.Cole; and havinga great tune like ""lovely"" on his album Tally HO! you know thisguy can make better music than this...if you don't believe mejust listen to the samples. And the Single is Sooo bad they don't even let you listen to it! - not a good sign guys.Frankly i am unsure how people get into slightly out of tunemusic; but apparently some love it...and Vibert for themmust be the greatest! Buy: Stop the Panic and forget about thisguy. he stinks."
1,was of money for me.,I do public speaking. This does not help my voice at all. I wish it helped buy I cannot tell any difference when I use it. It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
2,Meh,"Made me flem up and gag more than helped me, but that might just be me. I'll stick with Singer's Saving Grace."
1,Counter-productive effect - Bad service,"I ordered this product on a Wednesday, needed it for Sunday, and paid $14.95 for rush shipping. I then immediately emailed them asking them to expedite the order, especially since I paid so much for shipping a tiny item. I recevied a response over 24 hours later informing me that I would receive the product on Monday, 5 days after my order, AKA standard delivery time.My next performance, I kept myself hydrated the day I had to sing, and used this as a supplement to hopefully prevent the random coughing fits I get from my nerves drying out my throat. It tasted like sugar water, and had the effect of causing me to cough MORE than usual, rendering the product useless and counter-productive.Would NOT recommend."
5,Amust ahve for vocalists!!,Thanks for prompt shipping! Excellent product- ordering another!Appreciate good service A+ All the singers find this product to be a huge help before a show and a true must have! Thanks again!
1,Unhelpful,"Perhaps I'm one of the unlucky few, but this product did not work for me. I am the vocalist for my band and I had been having some vocal hoarseness. This product, while not tasting bad, only left me coughing. It somewhat burned the back of my throat and was mildly uncomfortable. This product didn't help me any better than a cup of warm tea. I hope it works better for the rest of you."
4,Beware of side effects,"I love the way this product made my throat feel, but after a few days of using it, my blood pressure shot up. One must be careful of side effects when using an all-natural herbal product."
4,Tompkins' most bizarre volume yet,"A bizarre, somewhat disjointed read not for the scientific faint-of-heart, but for those familiar with Tompkins' strange excursions and capable of suspending scientific disbelief, another intriguing, startling exposition; includes discussion of Theosophists, Rudolf Steiner, astral planes, occult chemistry, fairies, woodland spirits, and the like. Tompkins is one of those far-out writers who, inexplicably, I consistently get a kick out of reading (and constantly wonder if he himself believes everything he writes about?). Personally I give this wild, rambling read a very high ""4"" for enjoyability, but it is the sort of volume other folks will either love (if they are inclined toward the metaphysical and esoteric) or...hate."
1,"Poorly written, boring and lacking focus, a waste of money..","What a disappointment. The review sure sounded great? There might be some good information in the book for someone with the patience to wade through it. Between the arcane vocabulary and the way the author takes forever to get to the point, the book falls flat. The only good thing about the book is the subject matter. If a good book on the subject can just be found?"
1,Only scam,"This book is written on second hand, unreliable info, just the kind of ""I heard that..."".Peter Tompkins is the kind of writer who likes to compile things from other sources. But this time the content is poor, low quality, just sounds as fake as possible, he could really have done better.If you are interested in Fairies, no doubt you will be able to find better reading elsewhere."
4,A good basic introduction to monitor repair,"Computer Monitor Repair by Joe Desposito and Kevin Garabedian is probably the book you would want to read if you know nothing about how a monitor works. The book is written in such a way that it is very easy to understand, and contains good illustrations as well. I would not recommend this book to those who already have a background in repairing monitors because much of the information would only serve as a review."
2,An old book now!,"The diagrams were very unclear, I wish someone would write a clear and consice book on all the aspects of monitor repair."
4,A Significant and Searching Volume,"This is a terrific book - an almost brutally introspective and honest exposition of the development of an A personality unexpectedly tempered by a true search for spiritual center.Mr. Cole's protagonist is a character raised in abuse and driven by questions of existence and the search for freedom - first in the church as a seminarian then with other members of his generation in drugs and hedonism.After meeting his wife to be at the Woodstock Celebration, he slowly enters the middle class world and spends several decades as a successful salesman. But inevitably, his earlier questions finally come home to roost - forcing him back inward.Told in an intimate and sometimes unexpected voice.A book to be read by everyone of our generation."
4,Oil fired furnace,"This is a very good book that has all the calculations and everything worked out. He tells how to independently design your furnace in case you want something slightly different and what to take into consideration. Unfortunately, it requires a lathe, quite a few welds, a cut off saw that can cut metal, and an oxyacetylene cutting torch. But if you already have those, you can make this furnace for a reasonable price and ease.Trevor"
3,Good book,"Very informative and has a lot of useful information but is very complicated and vague on the list of materials. It would have been much easier to follow and build if it had a basic list of materials you needed and a solid step by step instruction process. I will not be building the furnace described in the book but I will be using some of the formulas and information to build a different, simpler one."
3,Not for the average person,"Steve Chastain knows his subject, but is short in conveying itin a lucid manner. If he had better graphics in detailing theparts of the tilting furnace as he had in his book on cupolafurnace, it may have helped. But even the cupola book would havea hard time beating C.W. Ammen on the same subject. Buy the bookfor Steve Chastain's knowledge...it's worth it."
3,not detailed as expected,"I purchased the item for its illustrated+wordings combined explanation on aviation terms. But it turned out that the dictionary covered a quantitative of words instead of a set of qualitative explanations.Good thing about this book: I can find most of the aviation terms in the book.Bad thing about this book: As a beginner larning about aviation, the dictionary is not indepth enough to solve the questions in my mind. Explanation is not detailed but rather a touch of the surface."
5,orbital array of sounds,--This is a must for anyone that loves music w/ a pulse. It is both cerebral and visceral. Recommended for candy-flippin.
4,super chill-out pop music,"i got this single by chance when i had nothing better to buy, but you know what? it turned out to be one of the best singles i've ever bought (first come all the madonna singles). anyway although the album version is kinda strange and hard to get acustomed to, the 4 other remixes are absolutely awsome. especially the babinstrumental and the classic club remix. this cd single is worth your money but don't let them rob you. i also recomend the single for SUPERSONIC a lot!"
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I was excited to get my hands on this book after hearing so many great reviews. While quaint and not terribly written, the book never gained momentum and barely grasped or held my attention. I waiting for something to keep me going, but it never came. After 84 pages, I gave up Standing in the Rainbow and watched this one go back on the shelf!"
1,I couldn't even finish this.,"I have enjoyed Fannie Flagg's previous books and was looking forward to this one, but once I got started, I couldn't force myself to finish it. The characters were a little too odd for my taste."
1,So-so,"This was my first exposure to Fannie Flaggs work and, while I didn't hate it, I can't say it had any kind of a plot and everything just fizzled out and died by the end. Some of the characters were enjoyable and some were just annoying. Every time I started to feel interest in where I felt the story was headed, it jumped to something less entertaining and then the story I wanted to know more about was summed up or skipped altogether. A very unsatisfactory read by the end. Did not live up the the potential I felt it had in the beginning."
1,Disappointed,"This book was nothing that I thought it would be. It could have been a very interesting story, but instead was too long and a struggle to complete. Storylines were skipped over too quickly in some chapters, and years passed uneventfully. Did not make for a very entertaining read."
3,A little disappointing,"With all the great reviews, I guess I was expecting more. Maybe it was the writing style, a little choppy. However, there were times that I burst out laughing."
1,Dull and disappointing,I have read all of Fanny Flagg's other books and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one. I have now read the first 150 pages and I am still waiting for it to kick into gear. I picked it up and put it down several times already. What is the point? Where is the story? What is to laugh about? This book is deadly dull. I cannot punish myself by reading further.
2,Fair... just fair,"I usually love Fannie Flagg's works with her rich characters and plot twists. But ""Rainbow"" was lagging a bit in both departments. Beginning in the 40's, the book spans over 40 years of life in small town Missouri... or does it? Flagg seems to get lost in an overabundance of characters and plot lines. I wanted to know more about Betty Rae's relationship with her husband's mistress, or how Doc and Dorothy's children really did in the world. I wanted more of life on the gospel road with the Oatman's, and more about Jimmy and the Blind Songbird.... but alas, all the characters got muddled toward the end, and it felt like Flagg was on a deadline to finish the manuscript and just tied some neat little bows on the plot without real resolution.The audio book was a great way to pass time on the road, but I felt very disappointed at the end... I wanted more and it just wasn't there!"
3,one boring cliche after another,"I am a big fan of Fannie Flagg's, so I was very suprised and disappointed by how cliched this book is. Every chapter is like an episode of 60's television. It reminds me of Our Town. I missed the fun and the laugh out loud humor of her previous books."
4,"From a guy reader. It's very good, better than an NFL game","People love to categorize books--a woman's book, a guy book, etc., but in the end a book has to stand on its own. This one certainly does. Yes it's sappy and yes it's bit much (especially all that political stuff with Hamm getting elected governor), and yes it begs to get smacked for being so syrupy, but in the end, it's a great pleasure and you can't help but smile and feel good, and any book that does that is a success and merits good ratings. So for you guys, it's ok to read this between NFL games and the World Series. Trust me, it'll stay with you longer and it's even more enjoyable. I can't give it 5 stars because it is over the top with the politics, but the characters are wonderful."
2,disappointed,ordered large print and got small print. bought it for 85 year old mom who requires large print and was not able to give it to her for christmas. waste of money!!
2,sentimental view of post WWII America,"You'd hardly know this is the same author who wrote ""Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man"". As much as that book was smart and spirited and fun, ""Standing in the Rainbow"" is mawkish without a gripping story or good characterization. There seems to be no real point to the book other than to say over and over, Wasn't life great back then."
3,Can't stop reading her stuff!,"Forget nicotine. Fannie Flagg has got the addictive stuff right here!Standing in the Rainbow goes back to a small town we're introduced to her earlier works. What a pleasure to come back! There are some new characters introduced, and we get to see some old friends. The way Flagg writes, you really can't stop getting into how they're all doing and you can't stop hoping for more.As delicious as her characters and storylines are in this book, what disappointed me was the use of the supernatural. While several of her books have hinted at it, this book goes over the top and dives right in. That kind of made it cheesy and less appealing. I didn't think it was necessary at all, and it kind of ruined the credibility of the book.All in all, however, this is a read-it-in-one-sitting kind of a book, and I think Fannie Flagg fans will eat it up."
3,Long and Rambling,"I love Fannie Flagg's other books- they are thoughtful, warm, huuman. This felt long, rambling, and increasingly improbable as time went on. Started off well, but lost focus along the way."
5,Loved it,This is one of my favorite novels by Flagg. A must-read for anyone who loves witty humor and lovable characters. Flagg is a wonderful southern author and knows how to tell a story.
5,Feel Good Novel,"Standing in the Rainbow (Ballantine Reader's Circle)I was introduced to this book and this author through the book club I attend. This novel was a great find! I thoroughly enjoyed entering the world of Elmwood Springs, Missouri in circa 1940. Neighbor Dorothy and her friends have become cherished acquaintances. I loved this book so much that when I found a follow-up ""Can't Wait to Get to Heaven"" in my local library I grabbed that up and read it as well. Enjoyed it every bit as much as the first one. I highly recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy a feel good read and don't be surprised if you find yourself smiling or even laughing out loud frequently as you read about the folks of Elmwood Springs."
4,Great Title,"If you were born in the '40's or '50's and are into nostalgia, you will enjoy this trip down memory lane. Flagg's glimpse into a midwestern small town is uncannily familiar. I remember my Mother jotting down receipes from the radio's daily woman's program. Listening was a part of each day's schedule. Flagg's richly portrayed characters, were our neighbors. ""Standing In The Rainbow,"" a hauntingly familiar picture of the past.Beverly J Scott author of RIGHTEOUS REVENGE"
3,Ficticious Version of Chiecken Soup for the Soul,"Not much storyline, plenty of colourful characters shrouded by a feel-good plasma, that's how I would describe this book. This is where nothing bad ever happens and even if it does, it leaves a sweet (not bitter) after-taste. This results in the flaw in this book, your emotions are never affected by the book to a large extent because it also leads you back to a feel-good environment. Fortunately, the colourful characters and the light-hearted writing style more than makes up for the flaw"
4,Echoes of a Simpler Life!,"This is a warm, sprawling novel that will appeal to many,because of its sympathetic portrayal of marriage and small-town life, and its evoking of a simpler time when people of character seemed to do what was right.The novel centers on a daily half-hour radio program during which Dorothy Smith exchanges cooking tips and recipes, talks about her family's doings, and invites her listeners to stop by for a cup of coffee. The program is like a friendly visit for her listeners, lonely farmwives in the rural Midwest.Flagg's book depicts good moral people,and the characters are left feeling nostalgia for the past, with echoes of Lake Wobegon."
5,I enjoyed every paragraph,"My favorite novel of all time is ""Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlstop Cafe"", by Fannie Flagg. Next is this one. ""Standing in the Rainbow"", also by Fannie Flagg. Ms Flagg is the Norman Rockwell of literature, having the ability to paint with words a humorous yet lovable portrait of Americana past. This ia a lovely book that made me laugh out loud and, I admit, shed a tear or two, but Ms. Flagg's work always does that to me. I highly recommend ""Rainbow"" and her other novels as well. Also, I recommend two other books with similar themes and setings- ""A Painted House"". by John Grisham and ""The Curve:A Tale of a Gentler Time and Place"", by Ned Bibb."
5,Fantastic,"Words cannot describe how much I enjoyed this book.....I laughed 'til I cried....absolutely hilarious, and at the same time, so poignant.....It's one of those books you don't want to finish. However, at the same time you can't put down....You feel as if you know each character; and if you don't, you wish you did. I wish it had gone on for another 500 pages...I just finished it, and miss the town, and the people already.I want to thank Fannie Flagg for such a gift..."
2,Disappointed in my first Fannie Flagg read,"I was overall disappointed in my first read by Fannie Flagg. I heard many people rave about Standing in the Rainbow. However, I was left somewhat bored by the story. I was able to draw out the theme of trying to find life and to stand in your own rainbow but was truly disappointed, as the story never seemed to go anywhere. There was no true plot, no climax build up and really no overall story. Perhaps if I wasn't in my 20's but rather in my 60's or 70's, I might have enjoyed the story more. To me it was a book I would have been better off giving to my Grandmother to enjoy. I haven't given up hope on Flagg, I would like to read Fried Green Tomatoes (have seen the movie) as this novel seemed to have been Flagg's signature piece."
4,Reading to Feel Good,"This book is a wonderful read to just enjoy -- feeling like you are sitting down with a friend over a cup of coffee and discussing what's happening in your community. And, if you have any ties to small town America (I've lived in a town of 500 people as well as towns of 2 million) -- you will recognize some people in this book!It's not great literature, but it's fun and reminds us what the basics of America are! This is one of many types of books that should be included among an assorment of reading material where ""variety is the spice of life""!"
5,Storytelling at it's best!,"Fannie Flagg weaves a wonderful story taking us along in her witty, clever way to a small town in a bygone time and introducing us to a cast of characters so rich and interesting that they seem life-like. It's a delightful journey with old fashioned charm."
4,Small town tales.,"If you're in the mood for homesy-folksy stories of likeable people living quite ordinary lives, Standing in the Rainbow is for you. The small Missouri town of Elmwood Springs is one of those towns where everyone knows everyone else's business (and all the old skeletons in the closet) Neighbour Dorothy runs a daily radio program from her living room and does so for 38 years, and has lonely farm women from neighbouring states and counties tuning in each day with recipes and tips on household management. The other main characters in this tale are the Oatman family, a Southern Gospel group who travel around the country and who have a huge following. It's a likeable book..a feel-good book which can be picked up and put dowm at leisure without any brain strain."
1,Did not like this one at all,"I've read all of Fannie Flagg's books & I did not like this one at all. In this book, the characters are good, and I enjoyed the connection to ""Welcome to the World..."". However, I was unable to develop enough of an interest in any of the characters to want to learn more about them or even care what happened to them. As I got closer to the end of the book, I found myself skimming the pages just to get it over with."
1,If you need to fall asleep this will help,"Had to read this for book club, BORING. Will never read a Fannie Flag book again. Only one person in our book club liked this book. Most people did not even finish it. The most boring and unbelievable book I have ever read."
2,church of Christ,As a member of the church of Christ I was disappointed that the author did not research the background for the church of Christ.Please go to a woship service and learn the truth. Everything in the book is wrong related to the Church.
5,Best Fannie Flagg book,I've read 5 of Ms. Flagg's books. This one is my favorite! I purchased this book on Amazon as a gift for my mother. It's funny and full of small-town warmth.
2,Fannie Flagg books,"The story is read entertainingly by the author Fannie Flagg. If you enjoy listening to the details of everyday small town life in the past generation, this is enjoyable. However, I did not find depth of meaning or character development."
4,An Unexpected Gem,"At about the 200th page in this book I was about to lose all hope that it might pick up some momentum. Surprisingly, it did...and how! As one reviewer mentioned, this is not a book for those who love cynical, dark works of fiction, but it's definately a book for those who look for wholesomeness and good in people and who somehow, in their own way, long for a small town or community to which they can belong and be accepted.Flagg is an excellent storyteller, using amazing insight to the cycles of life and humanity. This book may not be as strong as her first (and best) book, Coming Attractions, but it still shows that Flagg is a writer that never stops exploring the lighter sides of the human condition."
4,"Good, but not as great as ""Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man""","I've read all of Fannie Flagg's books and this one was really good, although it didn't quite resonate with me the way ""Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe"" did or hold my attention the way that ""Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man"" did. Over all, though, its a book worth reading. You'll love the characters, except for Hamm Sparks."
1,Cute but not practical - handle gets hot,This tea kettle is very pretty but unfortunately I am returning it as I just tested it for the first time and the handle is extremely hot; so hot in fact that I am unable to pick it up. Very disappointed....
5,Cute,I love this cute teakettle. It is not big yet it does the job. I love the color and the flowers. It is not a cheap or light weight product. It is just so cute. I love it.
5,Great Handbook,"I bought this book the second day I was in Chicago. I wish I'd bought it before my move! This book was extremely helpful in not only orientating me with the basic neighborhoods/geography of the city, but it was a great reference when it came time to do all that administrative stuff associated with moving. It tells you where the DMV, post office, library, police station, everything (!) is. It tells you where to get your parking stickers - wish I'd known that right away since I got a parking ticket my first day in the city! This book is a great guide for anyone moving to Chicago, even those of us who are experienced movers but need information beyond how to find a place. I've only had my copy 3 weeks, and it's already dog-eared."
5,Fascinating,"Adela Rogers St.John's biography of her father reads like fiction not only because it is so well written but also because her father was such a colorful character. The character of Perry Mson was based on Earl Rogers, but reading this is even better than reading Earl Stanley Gardner because this is not fiction. Mrs. St. John's is a writer par excellence."
5,"Very, very good, so why has no one given a review yet?","Watched this many years ago when it first came out on tape. It's been in the collection since, and I think much underrated. Probably the title, as many don't think of this as ""The Prince and the Pauper."" Great cast, script, scenes, everything is absolutely topnotch in this effort to create cinema on Mark Twain's first attempt at a fictional ""historical novel."" You'll enjoy it if you've not yet seen it."
5,can't beat mark twain,"another version of mark twain's ""the prince & the pauper"". well made, very goodcast, what's not to like. oliver reed is always a scene stealer, just like errolflynn when he played the role."
4,Crossed,"I bought this because of the stellar cast of actors and actresses in the various supporting roles. They performed as expected, and the movie is quite good for its type. There are two problems. One is just impossible to avoid, in that anyone young enough to play the two lead roles is going to be too inexperienced to really do them justice, especially if they attempt distinct accents. The other was the sound. If I could have muted out the overly loud an annoying music, I'd have rated it a point higher. Still, recommended, and I find myself inspired to watch the 1974 version of the Three Musketeers again."
1,Very poor - not to be taken seriously,"This was just terrible if you like a movie that's close to the book (The Prince and The Pauper.) Important parts were entirely changed or left out, and the ending was a farce. I have never been more disappointed in a movie that was supposed to be similar to the book."
4,"Recommended by many riders, and I agree.","This book covers just about every aspect of riding from suspension set up to throttle control to riding strategies, it even includes a section on being a passenger. While I have yet to start doing the excercises included in the book, I have started using some of the techniques, and they do indeed increase your margin of safety. I also have more faith in myself, and in my bike. If you're planning on racing, while there is good information here, you may not be happy with this book, but if you're a street rider as I am, it's a great resource."
5,How to ride a motorcycle,"Good read. A lot of focus on how to think about riding.The author obviously put years of groundwork into this book.Author of the ""The Pace"" (the bible of how to group ride)"
4,I liked it,"If there was just one book I had to buy, this wouldn't be it, but I liked it. It had a lot of good things to say about mental attitude. There are some things I would of like to see him leave out, like his pictures. I am glad that I read it and will review it from time to time."
3,good,"Nice book,BUT some things are explained well but others are not.For example,on the"" ten steps to proper cornering"" WHERE THE HECK IS ""BRAKING""?.Although there is a chapter on braking it is totally forgotten the ""ten steps""unless he considers it to be over before the first step which is ""reposition foot"",but then it would not agree totally with the braking chapter.At least there should be advice like ""you can brake between that and that step...""or something like it.Anyway he keeps referring to KEITH CODE so at the end I was thinking that should have bought Keith Codes books,especially after attending CSS...actually I might just do that..."
2,Good reading but not much info,This book is well written as in it kept me reading. I always felt that the next page would have good information on it. The problem was I got to the end and never got anything out of this book other than I learned that Lee Parks thinks he is a much better rider than Larry Pegram. I bought this book for riding tips all I got was a few hours of reading time out of it.
5,Total Control High Performance Street Riding Techniques,"I liked everything about this book, especially the chapter on dealing with fear. Few motorcycle riders ever admit they are afraid at times when riding. Lee Parks explained how to deal with fear and how it can be counter productive. If you read, understand and practice what is written you will be a better and a much safer rider. I highly recommend the book to anyone that wants to take their riding ability to the next level."
3,"Not the best, but some helpful material","""Total Control"" isn't the pinnacle of riding techniques. Hough's ""Proficient Motorcycling,"" (both of them) and Ienatsch's ""Sport Bike Ridng Techniques"" are the hands-down winners in that respect. However, the book has some worthwhile content that other books don't cover. As a secondary source, it is well worth price. Some of his scrunched-up portrait photos would have a buzzard turn around and fly the other way."
2,"good for beginners, boring for advance","This book may be a good read for someone that is new to riding a sport bike, with only a very basic idea of how to ride. It does go into some good fundemental tips and techniques, he also reviews some riding gear, and setting up your ergo's. So, if this is the first motorcycle book you have ever purchased, and you have only been riding for a little while, and dont plan on being a hard-core knee dragger, then sure buy this book.However, if you are an experienced rider, this book is flat out boring. I even caught myself shaking my head in disbelief at some of this guys points of view and advice. Plus this guy is just straight up a dork, he try's to be funny, but he really gets on my nerves."
3,Great information but...,The book is full of very useful information and techniques for street and track riding and is a great addition to any motorcyclist's collection of books on riding technique.The thing that ruined it for me was the author's picture (head shot with different and sometimes goofy expressions) on each chapter's beginning... I found it very annoying.
5,Great advice for any level,I started riding in january. As I became more confident I wanted some advice on improving my skills on our mountain roads. There is so much in this book to try out that I'm still learning what works best for me. At any level there is useful information. Ride safe!!!
3,Average Advice,"Total Control: High Performance Street Riding TechniquesI've been riding on the street for about 4 years and I didn't really find much useful advice here. I would say that a beginner would probably get more out of it than I did. Keith Code's ""A Twist of the Wrist II"" is far more useful and what I would recommend to someone interested in learning about street riding."
5,Superb book!,This book is great. I've been riding for about 2 years now and wanted to learn more about technique and this book fit the bill. I've read a few books that are similar to Total Control but this one is by far my favorite.
5,The more you know the better it gets.,Total control is a very informative book. I've been riding motorcycles for 12 years and the tips that Lee gave me in this book really helped my riding. I've took the MSF ERC and they don't even mention some of the helpful ideas in the class that Lee gives in his book. Corners use to be a hurdle I had to overcome but after reading Total control they are so much easier and More FUN! Thanks Lee.I've read Sport Riding techniques by Nick Ienatsch also and Total control is a little easier to read. Both are must reads for all motorcyclist.
3,Knowledge is Power,Took MSF Basic Rider courseThis helps gonna take classGreat pictures theory with explanations and how to do it right
4,Really good technical book on riding,Lee Parks knows what he is talking about. This book has been extremely useful for me to improve my cornering. His step by step approach to cornering really works and gives you better control and confidence. It does take practice and faith in his approach. But I corner a hell of a lot better now than I did before reading this book. I plan to attend one of his franchised classes to further improve my skills. Buy the book--it's a good investment for your riding pleasure and safety.
5,To Catch a Thief,"What can I say about an Alfred Hitchcock film starring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, set in the south of France, that hasn't been said before?Marvelous, it's one of my favorite films of all times, great comedy- Jessie Royce Landis as Grace Kelly's nouveau rich, great-hearted mother is funny and fabulous!- The stars are superb and the background, both the Cote d'Azur as background to the story and the real-life background of Grace Kelly's meeting Prince Rainier during filming, make it all the more enjoyable. If you have never seen it, you should!"
2,Too Old,I don't mind rating things but don't want to write a reviewFar too old a movie. It was O.K in its time
4,Catch a Thief,"Great actors, good script, fun adult movie the kids would love.....why don't they make them like this anymore???"
2,Great Movie-awful print,"If you love To Catch A Theif, don't buy this DVD. It's one of my all time favorite films. But the image quality on this print is terrible. Either the studio spent no money on restoration, or the print they had to work with was so far gone due to age, that good image quality is hopeless. Get the VHS. It looks great."
4,Hitchcockian Cinema At Its Most Elegant,"Alfred Hitchcock once dismissed ""To Catch a Thief"" as a lightweight diversion, yet it remains an important work in several respects. Hitchcock made the picture in 1954 during one of his most prolific periods. The filmmaker's energy is evident in the vividness of the Riviera cinematography (by Oscar winner Robert Burks) and imaginative use of the newly developed VistaVision process. Cary Grant and Grace Kelly deliver stunningly cool performances - the carnal nature of their characters' romance (as well as the unmentioned difference in age) adds to the overall lasciviousness. The film also should be credited for its underlining theme of ""sex as larceny,"" a recurring motif in later Hitchcock works such as ""Psycho"" and ""Marnie."" Though not terribly suspenseful, ""To Catch a Thief"" ranks among Hitchcock's most elegant achievements."
3,Cary and Grace,"The epitomes of style and sophistication as they were in the South of France. A ""Bond Film"" before its time. The Place, the Space, the Cars, the Intrigue, not to mention the Romance. ""Starbusts"" in the Night Sky."
4,what a pair!,"Thank goodness they remade this Hitchcock film; it needed it. Wonderful pairing of two of the glossiest stars of the 50s when Hollywood excelled at just this kind of movie. Somebody is imitating the MO of retired cat burglar, Cary Grant, and it forces him back into service: a thief trying to catch a thief. Of course there must be a love interest: Grace Kelly, perfectly cast, the quintessential blonde actress who spawned an entire genre of look-alikes.This DVD offers some great extras including a bit piece about the making of the movie, some old-timers offering their memories, and more.You get more than your money's worth on this one."
4,glossy diversion,"Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, the two most glamorous stars of the 50's star in this beautiful piece of fluff about jewel thefts on the French Riviera. Grant is a reformed thief that is suspected of un-reforming, and Kelly is a rich American travelling with her mother (Jessie Royce Landis, Grant's mother in ""North by Northwest"") who catches the eye of Grant.The movie has one of unintentionally funniest moments in movie history. Walking on the grounds of a fabulous villa, Grant says to Kelly, ""Why don't you own a place like this?"" Her reply is, ""Palaces are for royalty. We're just common people with a bank account."" (This from, of course, the soon to be Princess of Monaco.) The DVD restoration was a definite improvement over the washed out VHS version, but they didn't do quite the restoration job that Vertigo got. This movie isn't one of Hitchcock's great films, but it is the assured work of a master (with a cast to die for), so it's nice to see it looking better."
1,Cheaply manufactured DVD is a rip-off !,"For filmlovers, there is only one important issue when it comes to discussing a first time DVD reissue of a cinema classic: does it fullfill their hope of seeing the movie with markedly superior visual and audio characteristics. The answer in this case, sadly, is NO! This DVD issue of ""To Catch a Thief"" has NOT been restored, and is in no better than the washed out VHS version.This is particularly regretable here, as this lightweight but irresitibly sweet and charming Hitchcock romp (which was awarded an Academy Award for best cinephotography,) relies heavily for its appeal on breathtaking visuals; ie., the spectacular aerial shots of the famous coastline of the French Riviera, the fire-works scene, the opulent costume ball, etc..My one star rating then is for the poor quality of the DVD, not of course for this much-loved film, which represents the highest possible level of light entertainment."
3,DVD not up to snuff !,"The aspect ratio on the DVD is trimmed back from the original Cinemascope for an HD TV look and without any edit-based panning. Such is never more evident than in the Hitchcock signature scene ...the one on the bus; when the camera (original production technique) scans only slightly from the left (the woman with bird in the cage) past John Roby (Cary Grant) to the viewer's right, Hitch is sitting there, all one-HALF of him ! Actually the VHS version at the 4:3 ratio, and employing pan'n-scan, might be appreciated by viewers as giving a better treatment !"
3,Htichcock On Holiday,"TO CATCH A THIEF is a light, frothy confection, full of beautifully shot location scenery, a mystery whose resolution is not rushed to conclusion, (though it should be obvious early on) wonderful verbal repartee between the brilliant Cary Grant and the never-lovlier Grace Kelly, with perhaps a dollop of comic frosting on the top to make it all go down quite nicely. Just the sort of pallette cleanser to prepare one for the masterpieces to follow."
2,Very Slow Moving actually boring at times,The Plot was Ok and the scenery was very nice but the movie just dragged along. It was a disappointment
4,Engaging,Love the old classic films. This was one to rememberd the color and picture was clear and sharp. Would recommend for any classic film fan.
5,PRETTY NEAR PERFECTION,"This is one of Hitch's 'lighter' films, which doesn't mean there isn't some genuine tension, or suspense. It's just that there's a lot more double entendre, humor, and romance than one usually associates with most of his films. Then, of course, teaming Grace Kelly with Cary Grant on the French Riviera pretty much screamed romance, and on top of this there's the luscious, academy-award-winning cinematography of Robert Burk. The dialogue in this marvelously witty, romp is also magically delicious. Grant is dashing, ascerbic, and charming, and Kelly is simply dazzling in Edith Head's beautiful gowns. The chemistry between the two stars hardly needed actual fireworks, and one can only imagine Hitchcock smiling hugely as the night sky outside the hotel window erupts with overkill behind them as they kiss. TO CATCH A THIEF is a must for any serious film-lover."
4,Hitch does it again,"Cary Grant is as dapper as ever in this somewhat more light-hearted Hitchcock thriller. The car chase scene is particularly humorous with Grant apparently scared witless as Grace kelly goes careening 'round every corner. Not exactly a nail-biter like ""Psycho"", but engrossing nonetheless."
4,The film deserves a full 5-star restoration!,"I've been watching Hitchcock's films in chronological order, and had just seen the wonderfully and carefully restored Rear Window from the Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection. As they showed the difference between what they started with and the final product, it was truly significant.This version of To Catch a Thief is similar to the unrestored version of Rear Window, and this film with so many stunning on-location views and vistas of the Riviera and its elegant hotels and chateaus -- which contributed to its color staff winning an Oscar -- deserves the full restoration treatment."
5,"The Classic ""Good Thief"" Story!","As I'm sure you've already guessed from my title, I'm a fan of all forms of stories with ""the bad guys as good guys."" To Catch a Thief is the ultimate classic for this storyline. Smooth, suave, good-looking John Robie (Cary Grant), southern France ""cat burglar"" with an adorable British accent, sets the incredibly high standard for the thief-hero. We have this classic in VHS. I'm glad I put off getting the dvd until now--I'm sure the Blu-Ray will be exquisite! Can't wait to own it!Requisition For: A Thief: Book 1- A Diamond for the Taking"
5,EXCELLENT DVD!!,EXCELLENT MOVIE WHERE PRINCESS GRACE KELLY SHOWED HER PROFESSIONALISM AS AN ACTRESS!! GRACE KELLY IS ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S FAVORITE ACTRESS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE! RATED BY: BRILI
4,Smart and classy,"Hitchcock and Cary Grant bring their customary magic to this stylish and frothy thriller-cum-romance. While this film may certainly be more to the taste of the female half of the population than the male, Grant's debonair ease and the suspense involved in cat-and-mouse game between police, suspect, and real thief is enough to keep anyone interested, and the snappy dialogue between the main leads anchors this well-made film. There's neither deep passionate romance nor spine-tingling suspense, making the film lack that quality of being truly great, but it succeeds very well at what it attempts - to be a light and very fun theft/romance film with a touch of Hitchcockian darkness."
5,This movie is timeless,Just watched the movie last night. It has been a couple years since we last watched it. We enjoy Europe and the French Riveria is a great place to see in the background throughout the story. I enjoy both Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Two great stars and beautiful people. The costumes and the settings are wonderful. Good stuff!
5,Cary Grant does it again,"I am a major Grant fan and I collect his work as best I can. This film shows him slinking across rooftops, eluding police, and capturing the real thief. All caregfully designed to entertain.If you havn't seen this one, your in for a treat!"
4,Attention to Detail or 58 years too late,"One of my favorite movies. It's always a treat to see where Hitch will appear. After watching To Catch A Thief a few times or more, not sure if much attention to detail was paid or maybe the eyes deceive. As to the scene of Cary Grant wearing a grey suit. It appears a wardrobe change from a besom pocket on the jacket to flap before the final appearance with the Honorable Princess Grace."
4,The Cat is Wrongly Accused...,"John Robie (Cary Grant), a.k.a. The Cat, is the main suspect in a number of big jewelry thefts along the French Riviera. The jewel thief has used the same methods once used by the former cat burgular, Mr. Robie, and when the police arrive to Mr. Robie's residence he has to escape with the notion that the law will not believe a former thief. John also realizes that he must find the real thief in order to prevent further thefts to be blamed on him, and with the help of a insurance agent from London he finds out where the thief might strike next. The next target might be Jessie Stevens and her eye-catching daughter Frances (Grace Kelly) who he befriends. To Catch a Thief is a stimulating film that won Oscars for best cinematography. The end result is a thriller that delivers suspense and drama while offering a first-rate cinematic experience."
5,AH MAY ZING,"This is my all time favorite movie. One which I have seen at least a hundred times. I am blown away by the difference in the Blu Ray version. I am noticing details of the interiors, the clothes and the scenery that I never have before. Absolutel a must for a fan. Do not hesitate."
3,Old Movie with cliched stereotypes,"Beautiful setting. Lots of flowers and lots of French. Pretty good for the era, though Grace Kelly is one of the worst actresses ever, stiff as a board."
2,No Chemistry Between the Stars,"Perhaps it's Cary Grant's robot like charm. Or perhaps it's Grace Kelly's utter lack of it, but somehow these two never looked like their romantic radars were on the same wavelength. Grace Kelly is beautiful in a classic, albeit unexotic way, but her acting is nonexistent, as is the chemistry she generates with Cary Grant.As for Mr. Grant, Grace Kelly seems to be the last thing he is interested in. It's a wonder things work out he way they do. Cary Grant banked on his remarkable charming screen presence, while Grace Kelly serves as window dressing with no personality. It would have been nicer had she lost that fak-o English accent. It's really too much.Kudos to the beautiful setting."
3,It was okay.,"I wasn't too impressed with this film. I am usually a fan of Care Grant, but this movie didn't move me that much."
5,classic Cary Grant !,"If you have not seen the film yet, I am very surprised about other reviews that claim there was no chemistry between Grant and Kelly --- there seemed to be a playfulness between them, very obvious when she first kisses him with a sultry look leaving him with a silly grin.The story, as a classic Hitchcock, is tightly knit (and as such you need to keep your eye on the story or you may get lost).This one of our Hitchcock favorites."
4,Eye Candy,"This movie was made before jet travel and TVs were pervasive. In addition to the beautiful scenery of Monaco, it has beautiful Grace Kelly for the men and Cary Grant for the women. The lovely blond supporting player is good on the eyes too!The script has great jokes, a little snide about Texas oil widows and thrill seeking heiresses. It has the characteristic Hichcock practices of adding humor to otherwise serious situations and attractive characters who are less than top drawer (a cat burglar, a spoiled heiress).The visual metaphors of fireworks, etc. add grist to movie buff trivia mills. And of course, it was during the filming of this movie that Grace met Prince Rainier. A thoroughly romantic story in every aspect."
5,To Catch A Thief,"To Catch A Thief is great. It does not enjoy the critical acclaim of some other Hitchcock films - its target was a broader commercial appeal. But I'm a big Cary Grant and Grace Kelly fan, and the chemistry between them was terrific. Also, an excellent Hitchcock blend of humor and story line twist. Highest marks."
3,Scenery and Edith Head but no suspense,"You could be forgiven if you thought you were watching a well filmed travel tourist marketing film on the beauty of Cannes, and in VISTA VISION, or a tribute to Edith Head with the emphasis on costumes, which is part of Hitchcock's game in the film about appearances, masks, lies, etc. The dialogue is reasonably witty, and yes, Mr Grant and Ms Kelly, look ""good"" in that lacquered, phoney, fifties Hollywood style. There's no question that the film, rich in colour, crystal clear, and glossy is well made. But beneath the gloss, it's a gossamer thin story with little suspense."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If you're the type of person who can be entertained for 2 hours just by watching attractive people be attractive then by all means watch this movie (and also check out Mr. and Mrs. Smith/The Thomas Crown Affair), but if you actually like plots and intrigues then take any of Hitchcock's other films before you watch To Catch a Thief."
3,Pants are so-so,"They are a great fit and wash well. They don't need to be ironed. However, they itch; and the material is very thin. I definitely can't wear them during cold weather. I won't buy them again."
2,feather touch pants,"Fit and drape of the pant is wonderful. However, the quality of the material leaves much to be desired, making it appear cheap. Regretfully, I cannot recommend."
3,Expected it to be longer in length,Expected the pants to be longer in length. Might be my fault for settling on Petite. Material also easily snags.
1,PETITE ALIA PULL ON SLACKS,"The slacks I viewed online were not the described product. The material was so thin, you could virtually see through the dark blue material. I of course paid shipping for the delivery to return the two pairs of these slacks and the initial charge for shipping them was also deducted from my purchase price. This resulted in approximately $5 to ship each pair and then $6 to return each pair. Total of $22 shipping for 2 pairs of slacks."
4,Bought it for the music...,"I have to admit, I bought the Uno DVD not because I was expecting an amazing movie or even because I careed about the film itself. Rather, I bought the DVD because Ulver contributed some music to the soundtrack. As expected, Ulver's music didn't disappoint. Aside from Ulver, the soundtrack featured some tracks by another musician, Tom McRae I believe. His stuff sounded pretty good too.As far as the movie goes, it was pretty solid. I'm not a big movie buff so I don't have much intelligent to say about the movie itself other than that I enjoyed it, especially the ending."
5,Terracotta,"I found this book to be a wonderful tool for the beginner or advanced sculptor. It leads you step by step and, as a 3rd-year sculptor, the techniques Lucchesi provides have greatly inspired and helped me improve my own techniques."
4,Terracotta,"This is a super book, very informative and easy to follow. It answered many questions I had, and introduced many new (to me) ideas."
4,Fired clay,Good descriptions and pictures. Very sistematic and helpful; give me excelent idea how to start working with fired red clay.
5,Gerber Daisy Night Light,"I absolutely love my Gerber Daisy night light! It matches everything in my bathroom, including my Gerber Daisy shower curtain and Gerber Daisy wall decorations. It is so pretty, colorful, and just the right size. It also puts out plenty of light in the bathroom at night time. I would highly recommend this item to anyone! I am so happy that I found it online, because I couldn't find anything in the stores."
1,Are you kidding?,"What a joke. This book should be called the ""how to"" guideto be Satan. Frankly, there are more intriguing, multi facetedpeople in Hollywood to write books about. When I want to know about Mike Ovitz, I'll read Variety."
1,LOSER,"A loser book about a manipulative, narcissitc, sociopath...and those are his most positive traits. Save your money. Go buy People Magazine."
1,FILLS WITH WATER...AGAIN...AND AGAIN...AND AGAIN!!,"Call me stupid, but I've purchased this item at least 4 times in the last 3-4 years and every single one has filled with water and stopped working. Do NOT waste your hard-earned cash on this joke of a product. It should be taken off the market IMMEDIATELY or a class-action lawsuit filed!!!"
1,loved it when it worked BUT.....,"I've owned 2 of these & they were great when they worked but they fill with water & that's that! I wish they could improve it & avoid water incursion, but I've owned them for about 5 yrs and it fails repeatedly!"
5,"Besides essays, this book also has writing guidance","Essays are arranged into nine writing styles, and discussion about each writing style is extremely useful. I learned a lot from this book."
4,It does the job,"I purchased this book just for a class, it was in good condition and it was used. No writing in it, slightly bent but it's been used so it's expected. Overall I'm completely satisfied with this purchase"
3,It's a textbook.,"You buy the ones your professor tells you to get. I saved a lot getting the books at Amazon though. Used is the new 'new', when it comes to saving money at college."
3,Wrong Color,Item shown is white..I received black. Arrived very fast and is a well made product. Why not just say it is black in the description?
4,"Nice set, but not as good as it could be","The camera is nice, the software is easy to use, but I dont like the starting switch. It takes a long time saving pictures and movies. The set comes with a good number of adds, the case, charger, tripod, etc. But could be better. The battery charger runs only with 110AC, so you cant go around the world with your camera. The case is closer to a bag, very big for this camera, so it goes so loose inside the case with no protection. This bag-case has no pockets for memory cards and small pieces.But at last, when you consider what you get for the money you pay... It is Ok..."
2,Camera maybe,The camera itself when it is working is great. The only other thing out of this pack which was worth the money was the bag. The battery charger is junk - so is the 1 GB card. I would not recommend purchasing from Ace Digital at all. There was no chance when a problem was discovered with the camera to get a replacement. Kodak also will only fix not replace anything. I have had many camera's from Kodak - this is the first one in which I have been truly disappointed.
4,"and you may ask yourself, where is my beautiful house","Ordered this book while doing a stint as a bookseller, but didn't manage to buy it before the company tanked and closed our store. I did, however, manage to read it. I'm still not sure what I read, exactly, but I was certain that I wanted to read it again. Strange obfuscations, language as weapon and target simultaneously, suburbia as new mythic landscape, most wondrous strange, really. Appropriate that the dalkey archive published this semantic violence; Flann O'Brien is sorely missed, surely. Anyway, one of the present commentators likened this book to hypertext, with its variable narrative(?) possibilities. I would add Tom Phillips' A Humument to that list, another obfuscation of language's (and text for that matter) possibilities. Recommended for anyone with a yen for the experimental."
3,"To Quote Another Reviewer ""Creepy gibberish""","As one reviewer put it, ""This book is a load of creepy, spooky gibberish..""Indeed it is. And sometimes you're in the mood for that sort of thing. I wouldn't want to subsist solely on Ben Marcus' creepy, spooky gibberish. But it has its place."
1,reader from california,"I first read a review of this book in the Time's ""Books in Brief."" It was the most scathing review I've ever read. I felt sorry for the author and did not, as I never do--and most especially with the Times--take the review to be anything close to definitive. When the book came out in paperback I decided to take a look. Well, there are millions of people in this country reading bodice-ripper romances so I imagine there's litle enough harm in one more intellectual poser having his or her say: it gives the downtown crowd and academics something to talk about, the usual ""cutting-edge"" crowd can mythologise one more of their own, and everyone is happy. ... The only problem is, why do these people take themselves so seriously?"
2,Creepy gibberish,"This book is a load of creepy, spooky gibberish - the product of a deranged imagination."
4,the age of noun and noun,"An interesting experiment in which human civilization is presented in the style of a very weird technical manual. People, animals, machines, etc. are all described in abstract terms that relate the parts to the functions. Neither parts nor functions are familiar, and words are substituted in such a way as to impart only the fuzziest notion of what is being discussed. A recurring gimmick involves using proper names to denote inanimate objects. For instance, ""the Ben Marcus"" is apparently some kind of parchment that can be hung from a pole. The writing is really very imaginative, and by the end of the book a kind of sketch of the novel's universe emerges. The whole thing reads like Mad Libs, but not in a bad way."
3,Some weird stuff,"I took a writing class from Ben Marcus at Columbia University, listened to what he said about writing and then read his book. I mean, how disparate the two are I can't easily put in words. In class, he is very straightforward... and then you read his book, which is just so non-linear it amazes me. I think there's some important work in this book, but I can't really get to what that important work would be. well anyway, this is certainly an interesting read for those who like to be challenged when they read, certainly an innovative work. Mr. Marcus has a great talent... he's just a little... quirky."
5,genius,"This work is not only a work of genius (lingusitic refigurings in the mode of Stein, though I would not say purely in imitation of) but immensely enjoyable. When I get bogged down in heavy literary fiction I turn to this book for it's humor and intelligence and fluidity. The sheer elegance of the individual phrases and the absolute bravery he exhibits in forging a whole new world from language is exhilarating and beautiful. One of the best buys I've ever invested in."
3,Most unpleasurable - must be literary!,Does Ben Marcus actually have aspbergers or is he merely affecting it as a literary style?Just wondering.
5,Defining Genres,"This is another book I discovered last semester in a ""Border Genre"" course. It's categorized as ""stories"" but I think they are more like philosophy. An excellent book! Ben Marcus also has another book I haven't read but I probably will."
4,Here's the Future,A stunner through and through. A world unto itself. This is what fiction can and should do.
4,Ben Marcus is a young beautiful god,"Ben Marcus is a young, beautiful god. What more of a review do you want?"
3,not bad not good,"not alot of tradional songs - alot of songs are not the classic ones. Its okay for some songs only.I only bought it for Booby benton's ""This time of the year"" - really a nice Christmas song. Only 2 others are the traditional songs."
5,remington steel: season three,i like watching excellent tv series and it goes well with my other remington steel series that i have and hope to collect them all.
2,replaced MUSIC,"I love Remington Steele, and was very upset to find they'd left out the original Tony Bennett songs in the episode of ""Steele Trying"". That's the San Francisco episode. I also read that some of the music in other episodes has changed, but I didn't notice it myself. Steele Trying was incredible in its original airing and the A&E reruns, expressions all timed to match the music, now its nothing special and occasionally the expressions seem stupid as they are out of context. All of this said, I would still have bought these DVD's as it is still Remington Steele and many of the episodes are still great."
5,Remington Steele - Season 3,Always nice to get a factory-sealed product and it was shipped in a timely fashion. This replaces my old VHS tapings of the show which are hard to play now.
4,Steele missing Tony Bennett,"Having these great eps. on DVD has been such a treat. The writing is just so smart and the actors' chemistry sparkles. The show looks great on DVD and the extras and commentaries are worth viewing.My only complaint is this -- the San Francisco ep. from season three, ""Steele Trying,"" is missing the original Tony Bennett tunes. I understand that those music rights must have been very costly, but it's such a loss. The original music was elegant, fitting, and sublime. The replacement is just schlock."
5,one of the best in the series!,"This charming installment of the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series is one of my all-time favourites, based on Hans Christian Andersen's beloved fairytale.Melissa Gilbert and Lance Kerwin play Gerda and Kay, who enter the frozen land of the Snow Queen (played beguilingly by the late Lee Remick) to learn some much-needed lessons about love and friendship.Along the way, Gerda meets the Lady Of Summer (Lauren Hutton) and the Robber Girl (Linda Manz) who both try to come between Gerda and her search to find Kay.Narrated wonderfully by Shelley Duvall (who also created and produced the series, even starring in a few of the tales), with brilliant costumes and sets create a bewitching tale of love and friendship."
3,They are bigger than what I expected,"They are bigger than what I expected, definitely not for the kid's size cookies. And they are not easy to use. Even I need to press them hard to cut, no way letting the kids have fun with it."
2,"Honestly, this book was just OK","It wasn't a great book. But it wasn't terrible either. This book goes back and forth from the past to the present and that was a bit annoying. Also, the main character was a bit annoying too. That's not something you'd like your main character to be. I think I liked the other characters better. However, I was glad by the end of the book that she (main character) finally accepted herself for who she was.Unlike the other reviewer, I don't think living in LA will probably make you care or appreciate this book. I live in LA. I lived in Watts, Compton, South LA, and now I'm in East LA-Alhambra area.I wouldn't recommend this book though, sorry. To be really honest, it was predictable. Some parts were a nice read, but overall, it wasn't worth my time. I wanted to like this book, but it was a disappointment."
3,Corrected second printing exists,"In the words of a faculty member ""this first printing is so riddled with typos and grave mathematical errors that you would have to include a multi-page errata sheet with it to make it usable."" There is no indication in any listing for the book that a corrected printing exists. We called the publisher to insure we were getting the second printing, but at least one patron lamented that they had purchased a copy online and ended up with the first printing. The only indication of changes in the 2nd printing is a single sentence on page xiii thanking the faculty member for submitting corrections over the first printing. PAMNET@listserv.nd.edu 9/20/07"
2,Let it go out of print,"Although it was meant for a one-year course, this text lacks much basic material. There is no set theory, no second-order logic, and almost nothing on recursion. Many basic concepts are given cursory mention. In fact, nothing seems to be developed as fully as one normally sees in an introductory text. The whole book seems like a jumble of information rather than a coherent narrative. I pity the students who had to use it."
4,Have patience!,"If you've never read a Tim Powers book before, stick with this story early. All his books are impenetrable in the early going, but if you just let yourself go with the flow, you wind up getting swept along by the sheer force of the plot. The pattern applies with this book, and it all gets pretty neatly tied up in the end."
2,Leftovers,"This work appears to have been assembled from notes for other books. There is no coherent narrative, really, and the various plot threads are not so much woven together as tangled. It rides the coattails of better books --and looks more like a marketing decision than anything else-- as it was deliberately touted as a companion work to Last Call --the main reason I bought it. Very disappointing."
3,"It's a long, long, trail, a-winding","There is an awful conspiracy afoot in the fantasy publishing business. As soon as an author writes two or three good 300 page novels, the publishers' thugs kidnap them. The thugs lock the author up in a decaying castle and refuse to release him or her until he or she produces a 700 page doorstop.As doorstops go, this one isn't bad. I managed to read all of it. Admittedly, I was 30,000 feet over North America at the time, so I had limited alternatives. I found myself wishing, however, that the author had picked about 1/3 of the ideas and filed them down to fit in a nice, tight, plot, as in Drawing Down the Dark.When I went to buy a book to read on the return flight, I picked up the sequel to Expiration Date, Earthquake Weather. I carried it around the bookstore for several minutes. Then I put it down. It's time to find a new author who hasn't been locked up in the castle yet."
3,2/3 of the way to being a total disappointment,"I'm a huge Tim Powers fan, but I came dangerously close to giving up on this book. The difference between Powers's earlier books and this one is like the difference between David Lynch's early and later movies: the former had coherent, engaging plots that were spiced up with liberal doses of weirdness, while weirdness was the entire point of the latter. Like David Lynch in _The Lost Highway_, Powers seemed to be _challenging_ me to figure out what the heck was going on in this novel. It was only my stubborn determination to find out, not any fascination with the plot or characters, that kept me reading. FINALLY, about 2/3 of the way in, Powers gave me a decent enough idea of what was going on to get me actually engaged in the story, and from there the tale really picked up the pace. Don't pick this one up for ""light reading"", folks."
2,Not his best work,"I absolutely adored Anubis Gates, and thought Last Call was OK, but this book really left me flat. I actually had trouble finishing it, and got the sense Tim did as well when he wrote it; it has a plodding feel to it towards the end.I never managed to fully suspend disbelief, and had a hard time getting over the silliness of much of the plot. For the real out-there, wacko stuff, he should stick with more fantastic settings, and not post-riot LA."
3,"Good, but slow to start.","I'm a huge Tim Powers fan, but I had a heck of a time getting through this book; sheer endurance kept me going until, over halfway through the book, things finally started coming together. I enjoyed it, but this is emphatically NOT light reading."
4,The essence of this book is longing.,"This book is a beautiful exploration of the fantastic that, while not as good as the classic Anubis Gates or the masterful Last Call, isn't far behind them. The phenomenon of 'Bar Time' alone is a fascinating detail (one of literally _hundreds_ that dot this story) and one that brings to mind recent physics experiments in 'synchronicity' that used photons to demonstrate connections across vast space.Powers goes one better; he demonstrates connections across the gulf of death. From the exodus of Edison/Kootie across a nightmarish LA to the arrangment of tv antennas and electrical wiring to allow a dead man to maintain his hold on his body undisturbed by those that would literally 'consume' him, to the cost of ghost-eating as a habit, this book flinches very rarely. Powers is one of the best."
3,"Not good, not bad, just average.","This DVD was just OK, it wasn't good, and it wasn't bad. It goes in depth about how the FBI works in general, but doesn't go into cases in depth very much (Waco, Hanssen) etc. 90% of the video concentrates on how the FBI works now after 9/11, dealing with terrorism, but there wasn't any piece of it which highlighted thier priorities before 9/11. Some of the material nearly went as far as to being borderline propoganda, but the directors appear to have tried to stay away from that. It highlights some of the FBI's ups, and a few of thier down's. It goes into mostly how the FBI handles security of bigger events, but that was nothing new to me, and shouldn't be for any of you (snipers of roofs, instense screening, gaurds, etc.) Overall, I'd have to recomend you don't watch this, but if you know absolutely nothing about the FBI, this may be a good place to start learning."
3,Fairly interesting/entertaining.,"This is a fairly well-presented documentary on the FBI. The creators of this film did a good job explaining what the FBI's role is, how that role has changed, and what should be expected in the future. It is a fairly superficial documentary, though: don't expect any complex analysis/insights into the operations of the FBI. Nevertheless, the editors did a fairly good job, got some interesting footage, and showed things that rarely are shown."
3,Very Interesting,"I found the documentary to be very interesting and I was able to learn a lot about the FBI. I do wish, however, that there was signifcantly more informatino regarding agent training."
1,not for children to play with,"Putting this set together was very time-consuming. And once it was completed we found that it was so flimsy that just one light touch on the tracks, and the parts fell apart. We are going to return it tomorrow."
1,"My worst Amazon review, ever..",I read the bad reviews on this & decided to go used from an auction site.I still spent more then this set is worth as it went into various recycle bins 2 days after the purchase.My son was SO excited to open this on his birthday only to find mom had to work over an hour to get it stable (using sure-track) The trains get stuck on the way down & you need to push your hands in to move it..this knocks down tracks & the crying begins...do this for non stop for 2 days...in the trash it went.I plan to try another spiral set before next Christmas. This time I will test it out in private so I can avoid upsetting a toddler who still thinks I should be able to make even a piece of junk work properly.
2,Ugh! It's totally frustrating!,"The only good things I can say is I got this free at Toys R Us when I bought a train table, and my kids love it (when they're able to play with it). It takes an incredibly long and frustrating time to figure out how to put it together, then it falls apart at the slightest touch. The parts where the tracks connect are too loose. I decided to glue them together, and they lasted for a couple days that way, then fell apart again. I do not recommend this train set at all!!!!"
1,No younger kid can put this together.,"Part of the fun for a younger kid is putting the tracks together, pulling apart, putting back together. This is difficult to piece together and even more harder to keep it that way. No younger kid will be able to make it work and no older kid will want to play with this train toy line. Sorry imaginarium!"
1,To frustrating for young children,I bought this for my son's 4th birthday. Thankfully I set it up to test it out before the big day. The track does not lock in tightly into the risers. The spiral is to tight. You have a very hard time pushing the trains around without knocking the whole thing over. I have already boxed this up for return.
5,Very cute and an easy challenge,this was great because there is only the puppy that needs to be stitched but the fact that he is roughly all the same color adds a bit of a challenge to a novice. I would definitely recommend it to someone who is relatively new to the hobby.
2,"Disappointed, they don't do the workout with you","I would give this 2 and 1/2 stars. This is more of an instructional DVD than a dance workout. Once you actually get to the workout part (there is a lot of bonus material on the DVD, including battle footage)the lead guy says, ""look, I'm not Richard Simmons, I'm not gonna take you through an 8-count routine."" Instead, they go through a variety of moves about twice or three times and then tell you to learn them all on your own and repeat each one twelve times or so. I thought this was disappointing because I don't have the patience or time to go through and figure all that out on my own. If you really want to learn Krump dancing and are patient, than get this DVD. Just be warned that it feels more like an instructional DVD than a workout."
5,Bullseye is THE VILLIAN,"Bullseye just plain rocks. I usually only read Daredevil stuff with Bullseye in it for that simple reason, it has Bullseye in it. Bullseye, is undoubtedly, the coolest villian out there and this just shows how plain ruthless he is. The book now has me hooked to Daredevil and I am an avid fan of the comic book. The Prologue will have you hooked in mere minutes and you will remain hooked until you have finished it. A Daredevil classic."
4,Sober and provocative cosmic wake-up call,"""The Case for the Face"" is a thoroughly sensible and compelling account of a small handful of resarchers with the intellectual clout to tackle an enigma mainstream science has labled ""off-limits"": the possible existence of alien artifacts in our solar system. The contributors raise fascinating possibilities that we would be wise to examine in depth. Validating the existence of probable artificial structures on Mars is an opportunity we can't afford to miss through fear of offending the status quo."
5,Just can't Put It Down,Finally a feasable and upfront explination for the atrosities that were carried out against the innocent citizens of Canada for greed. Masterfully told through a style of ficton that is almost absent in Political thrillers today. It kept me on the edge throughout. If this is true all I can say is WOW. Somehow I feel that this story has further reaching implications than what is told here. What else can you tell us Mr. Sullivan
5,Amazing stories,"Reading BLOOD TRAIL I, as one who would believe the worst of Bill and Hillary Clinton, was fascinated with the fictional story being told. All of the bad things I believe the Clintons are capable of were laid out in fictional detail. I don't want to ruin the read for anyone...but the last couple of pages were an ""afterword"" by the author (who, by the way, used a pen name to write this book)that revealed that the premise of the book was set in truth. Even supporters of the Clintons have to think about their support of them after reading this book and its disclosures that are being kept quiet by this country's media."
5,Blood Trail,Historical fiction written by a friend of mine. It is a very representative tale of sordid affairs taking place in that era.
5,Great,"This is a great book, with treasure and a couple of new cahracters that did not appear in the first few of the series. Read it now!!!"
2,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I did not enjoy this book at all. The plot seemed appealing when I read the synopsis on the back cover, but my goodness!Ms. Butler's style of writing is better suited for a high school creative writing class, not adult fiction.She does not have the narrative skill to keep her in the running as a promising writer. If you are a fan of YA fiction this may be the one... but I HAVE to give this book a thumbs down."
2,"Good author, Bad Book",I liked Sorority Sisters so much that I expected more from this book. I did not enjoy it at all. The characters were dull and hard to figure out. Story does not flow with plots. I would not refer this book.
3,Good Book,"I thought this book was good, I actually would rate it 3.5 stars. I liked how the author introduces the characters from her first book Sorority Sisters into this book. I liked the relationship between Nina and Jay, they made a cute couple.."
3,pretty good.,"After finishing college, Nina attempts to find a career, and the right man. She ends up meeting Maurice, who has a terrible temper. Nina also has to deal with her father abusing her mother. After Nina's first date with Maurice, she should have realized he was kind of crazy. I throught the book was good, but didn't really care for Nina's attitude sometime."
1,Teen Diary,"I was surprised to see that many people like this book. I think it reads like a poorly-written teen diary. Ooh! I'm dating a sports star. Domestic violence is an important subject, not to be trivialized by sorority, ""real Black men are sports star"" tripe. I was extremely disappointed in this book. College-educated people saying, ""My bad, baby."" But then maybe colleges still don't expect much out of jocks."
4,A Sweet tale of Self-Discovery,"From the author of Sorority Sisters comes a sweet tale of self-discovery as her characters struggle to find and define themselves in the context of their existence. While Butler's prose is sometimes understated, the message of family love and responsibility for one's actions resounds throughout the pages. A light and entertaining read that leaves a smooth and pleasant taste on your literary palate."
4,Good Read,I read this book prior to a book club conference and thoroughly enjoyed it. I read it in 1 day. The characters were authentic and well defined.
4,"Entertaining, Realistic, and teaches a lesson","All good fiction should leave you with a learned lesson. Ms. Bulter's novel really did since it was so good and realistic. I was so glad when she finally saw Maurice for the mess he was, so similar to her father. I also like the idea that her brother did have the good sense to go to counseling before he married. It great to have novels about abuse but the reader has to see that several people did learn a lesson and venture for ""Real"" help.The novel was sought of boring for a few pages because I was not intrested in someone just out of college but it really picked up steam she is one of the few young, talented, mature writers. I hope she will write another one soon. I was really impressed."
5,frisco big it up fi the st francis crew,frisco mi proud a you man keep up the good work. mi nu stop listen to the cd every chance mi get to see that it finally pay off fi you. big up everytime. peace
4,Great book on the hauntings and folklore of the Civil War,"I enjoyed this book. It contains many legends of the haunted battlefields of America's greatest conflict. Although, some of the stories sound mostly like folklore instead of documented hauntings, it does have some excellent documentation of the authors research on some of them. The only complaint I have is that the book did not seem to be too carefully edited, but it is a very enjoyable book."
1,NOT WORTH EVEN ONE STAR!,This book is a complete waste of time for many reasons: 1) Bad research loaded with misinformation 2) Difficult reading to the many type and editorial errors 3) No authentic documentation of actual paranormal activities... need I go on?
3,Heartburn!,"Just FYI, if you're prone to any acid-stomach issues, don't waste your money on this...it gave me uncontrollable extreme heartburn, even after takingPrevacid 24HR Caps 42-Count.Maybe it needs to be enteric-coated? :/Anyway, I can't speak to how well it works or how sedating it is, since I couldn't take it for more than a couple days before the stomach issues became overwhelming. Caveat Emptor, guys."
2,Not helpful,This doesn't seem to work. I still don't feel well. Doesn't do what they say. I would not recommend this product.
2,Has serious flaws,"Eye glasses pocket is way too small. Glasses hang out at least 2 inches. Cell phone pocket only big enough for small flip phone. Thin leather strap has a feminine look about it which casts the whole bag as feminine. Needs a broad leather strap, stronger metal clasps, and bigger outside pockets."
2,Man Bag Busted,I bought this man bag and the zipper has already broke.So I either buy a new bag or have the zipper replaced which will cost as much as the bag did.This is the first product I bought that did not last.
1,"Good Design, Poor Construction","I bought another one of these bags for travel. I already have one (real leather) that has served me well and has plenty of carrying capacity and I really like it. The ""real"" one cost around $100 and was well made. This cheap knockoff is poorly made. One of the straps broke the first week when we were in Europe. The other strap came apart the 2nd week. Also, one of the zipper ""pulls"" broke off soon after. I threw the entire bag away after returning home. Look elsewhere, because this is ""junky."" The design is good, but that is about it."
1,TIred of all the Lies about Fake Leather,"It's time for Amazon to put a stop to it. The word leather means nothing now. I searched for cowhide leather, since the word leather brought up fakes. If the other reviewer had not told us, I might have bought this, another inferior product. It's time for us to HOLD AMAZON RESPONSIBLE!"
1,Man Bag with Cell Phone and Eyeglass Pockets,The cell phone and eyeglass pockets on the bag would not snap close. Items in these compartments are not secure and will fall out of bag. Company should make sure that all compartments work properly prior to shipping out product. Would not recommend purchase of this product to other interested men or women. This was a waste of my money. I need another bag that has all working compartments.
2,Cheap,"The zippers on this product are the cheapest available and after 2 weeks of moderate use, one has already failed!"
3,This cake mix is OK. Note the serving size.,"I purchased this gluten free cake mix with the hope that it would be just as good as the cakes I have been missing since going gluten free about 18 months ago. Well, yes and no was the response I got from my family and my own impression after I baked it this weekend. The cake does have a lemon flavor, but it seemed a bit dry for all of our tastes. Maybe this was because I made cupcakes rather than a cake. The mix only makes one 8"" cake, not two cakes like most traditional mixes. I was able to salvage the dryness by making a lemon buttercream frosting as suggested on the packaging. I wish the package came with a recipe. I had to look it up on my own. In the future I will probably make a cake from scratch and continue to add the lemon buttercream frosting for some extra lemony-great taste."
2,grannies opinion,I purchased the lemon cake mix but did not really care for it. The lemon flavor was not strong enough for my taste and I did not care for the color of the cake itself. I guess I expected a yellow looking cake but I was disappointed when I saw the same color as the vanilla cake.I would not purchase the lemon mix again.
5,The Real National Championship,"I haven't seen the DVD yet, but I did watch the game on January 1st. USC solidified itself as the people's champion with a convincing victory over the ""victors"" of Michigan. The game was convincing enough to make 3 coaches vote USC #1, eventhough BCS contracts force them to vote for the winner of the BCS title game, which happened to be some small school from the southeast. This DVD is a must own, not just for Trojan Fans, not just for College Football fans, but for ALL sports fans. FIGHT ON TROJANS!"
3,Much Hype Little Value,"This game was vastly overrated as the announcers could not stifle their lies about USC's overblown prowess. Due to a relatively weak Big 10 and Pac 10 in 2003, USC and that year's Michigan teams were not much better than the 1984 BYU team that barely defeated a mediocre 6-6 Michigan team for the 1984 football National Championship. USC again played a game in its protected backyard and benefitted from many questionable referees' calls that enabled it to be the overly hyped, more glitz than substance folks' champion. As long as the Hollywood money does not run dry, the nation's elite players will head to ""Californy"" like a 2000's era Clampett family."
4,Lovable Book!,"This is a very reassuring book to readers that we all experience different feelings and emotions, and we also experience different perspectives on things happening around us. While we all attain the attributes of being courageous, childlike, accepting, respectful, kind, unique and beautiful, there is always so much more to who we are deep down inside. This is a wonderful illustrative book to show how one person can have many different qualities, while also being able to be proud of those qualities and build on them as we grow."
5,Great bedtime reading - great baby gift!,This is one of the best books for reading to your children. Because kids love animals the author does a great job of relating animals they recognize to critical traits of positive self esteem. The pictures are very colorful and eye-catching which draws attention. The supporting proses provides an opportunity to reinforce a positive message of self-esteem over and over. I find the book to be a favorite as a baby gift. I have received incredible notes of thanks from the parents.
4,Good read,"I think before buying it, one should look at it in public library...i loved it...my son was not that thrilled with it...or may be because he is 8 years already....a good book for younger kids"
1,Truly Horrific but a great Gag gift,"This is one of the most truly horriffic children's books of all time. A sappy, dopey and awful ride through the mind of new age madness. Everything from the cloyinfand cliched writing to the quasi acid trip art work screams help clothes and dirty hair.Tha being said,....when my daughter was little she brought this book home from the library once a week...because1. She liked the animal pictures2. I would read it and make funnny voices for all of the animals. All of the animals have ethnically diverse names (ie PEMA Panda....you won't find Bob or Susie used here in new age land) I used to make her laugh with my attempts at using silly voices to read the story to her.Now she is 17 and this book was purchased as a joke gift. It went over big. I suppose if you are a hippy...you'll love this...but unless you have the very specific reasons I mentoned to buy this book.....STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Have mercy on your pancreas- skip this book!,"This book is too saccharine-ridden for any self-respecting child. It mostly makes children gag. I have worked in a library and can count the number of times this book has been checked out on one hand. In fact, the only times this book had to be reshelved is when it was accidentally chosen and left for the librarians to clean up. The book is way to sugary sweet. There is no story and no interesting characters. Even the illustrations are watery and lack substance. There is nothing between the covers to stimulate interest in a child. The only function this book serves is as a therapy tool for severly depressed kids, but this might just worsen the situation. On the whole, this book is to be avoided at all costs"
3,A difficult read,"I found the ideas in this book interesting and stimulating. The philosophical approach is refreshing. Most listening books focus more on the mechanics, rather than the spirit, of good listening.Please beware that either the author, (Gemma Corradi Fiumara) or the translater (Charles Lambert), or both, are terrible writers. Maybe I'm on the ""listening for dummies"" level, but I found comprehension difficult even with rereadings. Out of curiosity I took one section and applied the Gunning formula to see how it scored. Gunning scores are supposedly equivalent to the grade level the reading best matches. So a score of 12 equals high school senior level; a 16 is college senior level. The section I checked scored 36! Granted, the section was a real head-scratcher, but the whole book reflects that ""level"" of writing.The ideas (that I could understand) are good. The reading is challenging. The writing is just plain bad. Be prepared."
5,A Baby Seal Brings People Together,"A warm, inviting story presented in a super interactive DVD. The menu items give additional information that is useful for discussion. Wonderful camera work, breathtaking scenes. ""A great experience for the whole family to see and share experiences."" The children watched it attentively, and were interested in DVD features. ""The index made it easy to find your place."" ""It has good color and sound. It made everything look real."" ""I liked it when the seal was 'singing' with the women."" Best for ages 8 to 12."
2,"No analysis or teaching, just listing of hands","The book teaches little about when to make psyche bids, and insted just lists examples from high level competition.Victor Mollo (The Finer Arts)0 has a similar book, which is better.What I had hoped to see was a discussion of when not to psyche (with some examples) and when it was good to psyche (with a lot more examples).The book should have ben titled ""Some Psyche bids made in high level matches or by good players"""
5,A great follow up to the GoF design patterns book.,"This is superb book. I felt it was easy to understand, of course I had already read the GoF book. It has a complete chapter filled with a great case study. It walks your through designing a UNIX style file system. There is nothing bad to say about this book, I recommend it to anyone who wants more after reading the original Design Patterns."
5,It's a pattern on writing !,"Your search has ended if you: -you loved Gof4's ""Design Patterns"" and you want to go beyond -you want to understand how do a group can achieve to a pattern even with different perspectives (programming language background, professional experience, etc) -you're looking for good examples on writing style"
5,"The key word is ""Applied""","Although I was familiar with the GoF patterns before I read ""Pattern Hatching"", John has given me a whole new perspective on their use. ""Pattern Hatching"" showed me how to use the patterns in a generative way. In the past I used patterns to explain a design I came up with through ""intuition"". But using the patterns to generate the design has improved the final outcome.Now I have a better understanding of the role of patterns in the development process.John has an easy to read style which makes the material very accessible. The length isn't daunting either. You should certainly spare the time to read this."
4,Trudy,"I loved the story and the characters but was very distracted by all of the typos! After about halfway through the book I started highlighting them and ended up with 24! For example, television was spelled ""tedeaision"" and the most popular one (five or six times) was STERN spelled ""STEM"". There was one word I couldn't figure out what it was supposed to be and the dictionary didn't have a definition for it either. It is not unusual to find spelling errors in books but I have NEVER read a book with so many! I'm sure the author would not be pleased."
1,Vizio - stay clear - i had two die,"In Dec. of 2004 I bought the Vizio P42HD from Sams club. Made a ton of noise when plugged in then in a week the picture went. After a back and forth I returned it to sams and they sent me another one.It was okay - but still made a buzzing noise that was louder then it should have been. After over a year (end of warranty) I started getting more and more white dots on the screen, and just yesterday (about 2.5 years after purchase) the screen is about to completely die again.Called customer service and they said my warranty is done and i need to take it to a technician who needs to then order the parts from Vizio all of which I will pay for.Under 3 years in this age of technology for a TV is a disgrace! There is no excuse for this and although I will be pushing customer service I would be surprised if it gets anywhere."
1,You get what you pay for.....,"After having this TV for only 3 months, I started to expierence burn-ins and contrast issues. When I contacted their support and was trying to explain to them what the issue was, all they heard was burn-in and immediately said it wasn't covered by warranty. They told me that the only way I could get these burn-ins, is if I left the TV turned on and an image was static on the screen for hours. I advised them that this wasn't my first plasma and I knew not to leave the TV on and they stated that I was lying. The TV was suppose to have a one year manufacture's warranty which wasn't honored.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!It was a great TV until it broke. But buying this TV is a big chance considering how aweful their support is."
1,DON'T BUY A VIZIO...heinz 57 junk,"Great picture and we thought was a great TV until immediately after the warranty expired, the TV expired. The repair man offered to fix it for $400+ ....what a joke. Better yet, contact technical support...or should I say technical 'referral service' where they say 'it's not under warranty, contact authorized repair shop'. Then I visit my grandparents who watch TV all day for the past 20 years and their Montgomery Ward console TV is still working..What the ?!"
1,"Visio 42"" plasma","Plugged it in and turned it on to a loud buzzing noise coming from, what looked like, the heat-sink. Just got home from returning it, i'm going to save up and most likely get a samsung. good luck all"
5,a great way to develop reading knowledge of the language,"This is one of the most fascinating language books I have read. Rundle's goal is to develop reading knowledge, as distinct from writing, speaking, and verbal comprehension. His hypothesis is that European languages are sufficiently similar that, with a few rules and occasional resort to the dictionary, you can quickly learn to puzzle out written material. Along the way, he has a great romp through linguistic history. Highly recommended."
1,Not printed well,"It is a photocopy, not printed well, not clear at all. Just like there is a shadow behind each word."
5,A spiritual Blessing,This little book is an inspiration. It is one the reader will go back to many times for insight and encouragement.
3,Genuine Honeywell - You'll need two for a model 17000,"These are genuine Honeywell filters even though they are actually manufactured by a medical products company ""Kaz USA"" that pays a license to use the Honeywell brand name.If you own a Honeywell Model 17000, you'll need two of these filters. Similar to other reviews, I don't like how I now have to install and stack two filters. It's also harder to wrap the activated carbon pre-filter snugly around two of these filters. Once installed the cover is lopsided so I can only hope there is an airtight seal. I question whether it will perform as well as the original single filter system.Depending on the model, you need to use one filter, stack two filters, and/or use the foam gasket that is included.From the box:Model 10500 (or HEPA filter 20500) uses two HRF-11 filtersModel 10590 (or HEPA filter 20590) uses one HRF-11 filterModel 17000 (or HEPA filter 20500) uses two HRF-11 filtersModel 50100 (or HEPA filter 20590) uses one HRF-11 filter"
3,I Agree,"My filters also arrived seemingly re-taped shut with no wrapping in the box. And of course I'm concerned as well that they may not be entirely new. There were UPS labels on the individual boxes to where they had been sent previously. I haven't used them yet, so I can't rate their performance, but it's certainly a better price."
2,Second-hand goods?,"I bought two filters, which both arrived in packages that had obviously been opened previously and then taped shut again. Inside, the filters were naked, free of any shrink wrap. The whole thing gave the impression that these filters were not factory-fresh, and there was no indication of that at the time when I placed the order. Needing these filters and not wishing to go through the bother of sending them back and then waiting for new ones (with no assurance that the ""new"" ones would be any better), I choose to hang on to them, but I am not at all pleased with the idea that these filters may well have been used previously."
2,Filter did not fit 17000 correctly,"I purchased 2 HFR-11 instead of the original sized filter. Spec claims 2 will fit the 17000 corectly. Well, it was a bit thick when you stack the two. I managed to tighten the big screw, but the cover did not close to it's normal position. Despite not fitting correctly, it seemed to seal ok."
5,voctorinox fillet knife,This brand is the best value I have found. I make knives and have tried several commercial brands. The Victorinox holds an edge better than many makers that cost several times more.
3,:( dissapointed,"these socks ar great for non diabetics. wellmade nice cushions, however not non binding around th leg :(. should not be listed for diabetics."
1,too much elastic!!,"Wigwam used to make great socks that fit properly and were true to the size on the package labeling. Even though my husband is a size 10-1/2, the 9-11 size is way too large for him. The heel area goes all the way up to his calves. The socks bunch up in his shoes and start turning on themselves. Also, the inside stitching has more than 4 inches of loose, untrimmed thread just sticking out. Wherever these socks were manufactured they obviously don't believe in quality control or workmanship. Another company goes down with the times!"
2,Already loose,"First time putting the socks on they were loose and after a couple hours wear they were falling down. Comfortable but the elastic is weak and I'm not convienced about its odor resistant feature. Walmart socks have worked out better, not as much cushion but at least they stay high on the leg like they are supposed to."
5,Wigwam Men Socks,These Wigwam Men's work socks. I bought them for my husband and he loves the thick bottoms. they keep this feet dry all day wearing his work boots. He wants me to buy him another 3-pack. The only thing is they tend to shrink a little in the dryer.
4,Not too bad,"I picked up a few pairs of these a couple of weeks ago for my monster sized feet. To me, they are too tight on my size 15 feet. After washing a few more times, they may be more comfortable.The construction seems very solid and they are fairly heavy. I don't think I would suggest walking around a summertime downtown event for very long or your feet may very well overheat."
1,poor quality,"I purchased a couple of these socks based on the reviews everyone has written. These socks are not worth the money or the reviews given to them. After wearing one pair of socks, they already have a hole in the heel and they haven't even been washed yet!! They were falling apart after wearing them once and they make your feet sweat. I'm not sure what kind of socks everyone else was given, but mine were not the quality everyone else was raving about."
5,Great socks,"Comfortable, padded in just the right places, well made and worth the cost! What more can I say? I LOVE these Wigwams."
5,Nice socks,My son needs a large sock and the usual ones that supposedly fit men's shoe sizes 10 - 13 were just too tight. The X-large Wigwam Men's at Work are roomy and very comfortable. He is on his feet all day at work and gives these socks high praise for comfort. I'm ordering more for Xmas.
4,lasting socks,"These have been holding up pretty well, little to no wear just a bit of loosening up from time to time that can be annoying. I'm happy with em because the last socks I bought just had holes cropping up at any point of pressure. If you need socks that are somewhat comfortable but will last these will do."
3,OK,"My first Wigwam socks were the comfort hikers, which were awesome, and Wigwams usually have great reviews, so I assumed all Wigwam products would be great. These are just ok. These are not as soft and don't stay up as well as the hikers, just for reference. I'm a size 8.5-9 women's and the medium is little big. Normal ok everyday socks."
4,Good quality for the money.,Socks arrived quickly. My husband says they are very comfortable while on his feet all day. Wash well no fuzzies.
5,Nice socks,"They're very comfortable, and they don't ""bunch up"" around the toes..and they are kinda warm too. What more could I ask for?"
4,Good but not great.,"These socks in no way can be compared to a real sock like a Thorlo. If you have never had Thorlo's on your feet you may think these are great. These socks are very solid and densely sewn together which gives me confidence that they will last. They are not particularly comfortable and they do not particularly breathe very well. That being said when I get home from having these on for 14 hours they are not paper thin and soaking wet like you would have from wearing anything with the name Hanes or Fruit of the Loom. These are definitely a step up from that and at a very competitive price. I pay more for a single pair of Thorlo's than a 3 pack of these. While I would recommend these and rated them 4 stars, I would not compare them to top of the line socks."
2,Meh,"The fabric feel is rough, when I walk I can feel air going through them and to my feet, and I'm a size 13 & the x-large size is a tad too big."
4,runs a little large,"The run a little large just wish they fit snugger otherwise nice socks, not as wark as some other pairs I own but still nice on cold winter days."
3,good enough,"Ventilate well, but don't fit as snugly as I like on my size 11's.Seem like they will wear well long term"
2,Pilling after ONLY 1 wash?,"Not impressed with these socks. $10.01 for 3 pairs (including Prime shipping) isn't bad, but pilling after only 1 wash?I have bought 'work' socks from my local dollar store @ $4.00/pair that are still holding up after 2 years. Maybe I should have spent a few dollars more and purchased the higher end Wigwams."
3,Could be better...,"I bought these for a heavier weight winter sock to wear with running shoes. They are warmer and thicker than what I usually wear on the foot area, but the calf is too tight. Restricts circulation and left marks on my leg. They need to loosen the calf area and also thicken up the material above the foot."
3,They're alright.,"Based on the price, these things are decent Really warm, but a little on the tough side –not the most comfortable socks in the world because of the material. I found that the elasticity was a little bit lacking; at times I'd find myself pulling up the socks after they'd slipped a little. And this is all within the first 2 weeks of use, so I'm not sure how long they'll hold up on that front. The slipping isn't egregious though, it's not like the socks fall down to your ankles. I'm docking points off mainly because of the texture of the sock, which is rough, but seems to be durable."
3,Got Lint???,"Ok sock, does produce the most lint I've ever seen in a sock. Scared myself the first time I took them off. They do fit pretty good and are a very warm sock. Have probably washed them 20 times now and am just getting a little lint at this point. Will try another sock before buying these again but they are not terrible."
4,reat socks for the price,Socks come a bit large. I have a size 13 foot and so I ordered the XL and these ended up a little big. Will by the Lg next time. These socks are high quality.
3,There Ok,These dont stay up on my ankles very well i am constantly having to pull them up throughout the day. I would try to find a knee high sock if your looking for something to stay up with work boots.
4,Thick and comfortable,These socks are thick and comfortable. Seem a little warm at times but thats better than not. Hope they last like they feel.
5,Comparative Analysis,"In ATLANTIC SECURITY: CONTENDING VISIONS, Kupchan presents severeal examples of what could and should become of NATO in the future. This is a book of 3 comparative essays by Stephen Walt, Olie Waever, and Kupchan. If you're interested in possible future scenario's for NATO then this work is interesting, even though Kupchan's view may not be plausible under current national circumstances for both the U.S. and several western European countries. Walt and Waever both put forth intriguing arguments on NATO's future. This work was a good introduction to the topic."
4,A deeply satisfying read.,"What an achievement! Millett's knowledge of his home turf, and of Conan-Doyle, are impressive, but what I like best are the original story line, the exotic setting and the breakneck, roller-coaster pace. Like many people, I read and put away Conan-Doyle (along with Christie, Simenon and Stout) years ago, in favor of more contemporary writing. I hated the tepid ""new"" Nero Wolfe stories, along with most other attempts to keep beloved characters alive past their time. Today, my tastes run more to Kaminsky, Evanovich, Cornwell, Perry, Hillerman and Rendell. So I was surprised by how quickly ""Red Demon"" grabbed me and swept me along. I won't buy the next one because it's a Holmes ""sequel"" but because this one gave me so much pleasure as a mystery!"
1,Exploiting Holmes,"This series started out well, with Holmes and Watson solving adventures in the USA (Minnesota, to be exact), but now has become nothing but an excuse for Millett to promote his own detective, Shadwell Rafferty, using Holmes & Watson as the drawing cards. I was very disappointed in this book, and probably won't read another of his."
3,Holmes vs. Hinkley,"Millett has a decent grasp of both Sherlockian lore and Minnesota history (the Hinkley Fire, Duluth, St. Paul). He tries too hard at the former, while I enjoyed the latter. The result succeeds, but not by much."
2,It Just Doesn't Work!,"Imagine! During the demolition of a 19th Century mansion a whole trove of unknown Sherlock Holmes adventures, manuscripts written in Dr. Watson's own hand, are uncovered! What a wonderful idea! Certainly there is plenty of time for such in Dr. Watson's time line. Larry Millett, unfortunately, is not the man to write those adventures. His style is dry and pedantic, and insists on making Holmes and Watson do things completely out of character. In fact, Mr Millett commits the most unpardonable of all mystery writer sins. He introduces a character in the last part of the book & ""pins the rap"" on him. Even if you had been carefully following the clues, you would have failed to ""figger it out"" because the writer cheated. All in all, very disappointing, especially for long time Sherlockians."
2,Holmes wannabe story; doesn't do justice to Conan Doyle,"The author tries desperately to impact his own sense of style onto Homes and Watson. Although in entertainment we all expect little from imitation, this book still falls short of the mark"
5,No matter if you are a Tauro or an Aries...,if you believe in the power and wisedom of the stars under which you were born...THIS IS YOUR DIET BOOK...THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL WORK FOR YOU!
2,Not a great classroom resource,"I ordered this movie because I was having my 7th graders write a compare/contrast paper about two different versions of ""The Three Little Pigs"" and I was going to use this movie as part of a closure activity.When I previewed the movie at home, it seemed very dated, and not really funny at all. The dialog was so stilted that it came off as cheesy. The only character who had any vivid presence was Jeff Goldblum's wolf. Even Billy Crystal, who I usually love, couldn't make it work.This production might work younger kids at home, but I wouldn't recommend it for a classroom."
5,Faerie Tale Theatre: The Three Little Pigs,"Hilarious episode from the Faerie Tale Theatre series with an all-star cast. Billy Crystal as well as his on-screen brother actors are excellent as the three pigs, and Jeff Goldblum is show-stealing as the Big Bad Wolf. Valerie Perrine is a knock-out and makes a surprisingly sexy pig in this faerie tale. A great comedic hit for the entire family to enjoy!"
5,I am ecstatic !!!!,"I always loved FTT as a child...They are equally as entertaining, if not more so as an adult. Shelly Duvall makes a wonderful narrator, as well as character in these enchanting episodes. I was missing and reminessing of these Tales and I could not be happier to have found them all on here!"
3,Riddled with errors,"A good intro to Number Theory for non-mathematicians. (Specfically, excellent for anyone who wants to pick up cryptography.)However, the numerous errors found throughout the book take away from it's impact. Not to mention some outdated algorithms in Chapter 5.A lower price would make this a better buy."
4,Great love story with a personal touch,"Living in Los Angeles with relatives in the desert, I identified with the main character on many levels. One can really get a sense of what it's like to leave the hustle and bustle of LA in favor of the tranquility of the desert. This story is told with a personal touch that makes it as captivating to a native Southern Californian as it would be to one from the Midwest. Johnson's words evoke visions and emotions that were a delight to read."
4,A good basic guide to simple and effective self-defense.,"This is not a book for those who are interested in learning a formal martial art. However, if you are seeking a simple and effective guide to street combat, this book has a lot to offer. Any one who has been involved in real life self-defense knows that complex and fancy techniques with too many moves do not work under real life combat situations. This is why the military and police are not taught formal martial arts, but cover things like target areas, pressure point areas, how to use your own body's weapons on these vulnerable areas of the body. This type of basic material is found in this book.In conclusion, if you are seeking a practical, efficient and street oriented advice, this book is for you.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Monadnock Defensive Tactics System-MDTS)."
4,A true classic,"The Odyssey is considered the world's first novel. Of Homer's two works (the other being the Iliad) the Odyssey is the more modern one, often reading like an action/adventure movie. If hase been the source of limitless inspiration in western art/literature.The story is simple - Odysseus has a ten year journey to return home from the siege of Troy (which is the subject for the Iliad). He has many encounters (the most well-known in popular culture being the sea sirens, Charbrides and Scylla) and returns home to find his estate in disorder and his wife plagued by suitors, the general opinion being that he's dead. Revenge follows.This is a great story as it winds through so many twists and turns and changes of scene that you're left with the feeling of having travelled through the ancient Mediterranean. The translation, while probably not idea, is good at rendering this as a story - the prose form and language make this easy to read.Thoroughly recommended!"
1,This is NOT a Herge's creation...,"Despite what Amazon.com listed in its webpage, this is not drawn or written by the original creator. As noted by earlier reviewer, there were far fewer pages than any in the original series and the storyboard frames were far larger and fewer in each page. In all, the number of illustrations might have made up but a third of any other Tintin's adventures. The artist used a watercolour wash for much of the many frame's background instead of the very detailed pen and ink method of the original, thus giving the whole book a less-than-ideal muddy and dull quality. Since much of the enjoyment from the Tintin series were of taking in many of the details of the illustrations, I find myself not being able to be drawn into this poor knock-off as I have been with all the other Herge's creations! I would suggest bypassing on this purchase unless you are a diehard Tintin fan and wanted to collect everything of Tintin's!"
4,Lake of Sharks isn't the best Tintin book,"Tintin has set on another adventure in the country of Syldavia. This time Tintin, Captain Haddock, the Thompsons and Snowy fly to Syldavia to meet Professor Calculus on Lake Pollishoff, an artificial lake that has a curse on it. The trip is doomed from the start when Tintin & Co. barely survive a plane crash only to be saved by two Syldavian kids, Niko and Nushka. The crew meets Professor Calculus on the Villa Sproj on the lakeside but mysterious things happen when the group gets attacked by a frogman who is trying to steal an invention by Professor Calculus. Also in the story is Bianca Castifiore, her pianist Wagner and the ruthless Rastapopoulos. The color is a little dull compared to the other books and their is 44 pages instead of the normal 62 pages. I would only recommend this book to die-hard Tintin fans."
4,Copied Objects,"""Tintin and the Lake of Sharks"" is a comic based on frames from the 1972 French film of the same name, with linking narration boxes for the bits trickier to capture into comic form. It's an okay story, and it looks fairly good, but it's more for fans than anyone else. It's similar in some ways, but has a different feel and appeal than the original Herge comics. More of a light tribute than a proper story. It sees an old enemy of Tintin's trying to steal Professor Calculus' new invention, a machine that copies objects, and kidnaps a couple of Syldavian kids to bargain with. Probably one of the last Tintin comics to pick up, I think. Three and a half stars."
1,Not The Tinin I Know,"Neither the film nor this, its companion book features the Tintin I know. For starters, the art is not his creator, Herge's but a poor copy. Our hero is taller, more muscular and frankly appears to be an adult instead of the teenaged boy who appeared in the original albums. The secondary character's aren't Herge's, either. The boy, girl and dog featured don't contribute anything to the story that couldn't have been done more effectively by Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus or the Thompsons.About that story: While Tintin and Company do find themselves with a mystery to solve it's all done too quickly and easily, reading more like competent fanfiction than a professional attempt. The boy reporter himself just isn't given the chance to display the resourcefulness and inventiveness that made him famous. Almost any popular kid character could've been plugged into it with the same, rather bland and predictable result."
4,jobst socks,"Jobst Medical Legwear for Mens Socks, Knee High 30-40 mmHg Compression, Black Color, Size: Medium - 1 Pieceit is a good support socks very usefull for doctors and sport persons who stand for long hours drmkmani"
5,Best price,The support socks (I bought several pairs) arrived as advertised. Price was the best I could find. Very pleased with the service and the product.
4,does the job,The stockings work as advertised. Very comfortable. Need to learn to put on and take off since it is not as simple as regular socks.
1,A horrible product,"After I tried several pairs of cheap compression stockings and I decided to buy a pair of JOBST For Men. I had my prescription and measurement (both done by professionals). I gave the prescription to the Pharmacist (he does measure, too). He said the medium size should be perfect for me (perfect size, perfect type, perfect length, and pressure as prescribed).PROS: Very durable material. This is all I can say!CONS: The pair does not have the same pressure (left/right). One is extremely tighter and uncomfortable (does not matter which leg I wear). It is not gradient at all. The top is very tight and cut a deep line. The other cheaper pairs are too long for me, but at least with good pressure."
2,I shouldn't've expected anything...,"If you're reading this, I'm sure you have a pretty good idea of who or what the DIRTY PAIR are...two bikini-wearing, loose cannons who ""get the job done,"" when all else fails.There's a lot of gun play, lots of cleavage, and some funny repartee between the two catty heroines. In fact, the one liners are probably the most amusing part, given the rest of the story is pretty run of the mill.If you must see it, it's worth renting or buying used, if you can find it really cheap."
5,Thank Goodness for Amazon,Thank goodness I found a replacement. This toy was a much loved pet of my little girl...until our 7 month old puppy escaped into the bedroom and took a liking to the toy poodle. The puppy chewed the face off and my daughter was distraught....I searched everywhere and the best price and best service came from Amazon. You put a smile back on a little girls face.
3,Action-lite: it's great!,"With all due respect to the ""I'm in Army Aviation and this movie sux' fraternity, not everyone gets a buzz from watching military training movies. In Firebirds, Nick Cage looks suitably angsted, Sean Young suitably hot and Tommy Lee Jones his normal dry laconic self. For the non-military lay-person, the helo flying seens are great and if they do no more than engender some positve interest in a segment of the Army that has taken a few brickbats in the last few years, it will be useful. Firebirds IS Top Gun with helicopters...less the Top 10 sound track...it has great action scenes, a tried and true story line (does anyone really doubt how it will end) and flows from beginning to end. It compares well with similar in the genre like Flying Leathernecks, Navy Seals, Delta Force, and GI Jane...just sit back and enjoy!"
4,MORE TOP GUN BUT IN A HELICOPTER,"YES IT IS A DIFFERENT VERSION OF TOP GUN, BUT ANY ALL AMERICAN, APPPLE PIE EATING,BASEBALL LOVING, FLAG WAVING AMERICAN WOULD LOVE IT!"
3,"Young Nick Cage, Still a classic performance","This was basically the Army version of Top Gun, with helicopters. That being said, its a movie I saw as a kid, and have always wanted to add to my collection. It stars two of my favorite lead actors in Nick Cage, Tommy Lee Jones, and the actress Sean Young, who is probably best known for playing Lt. Lois Einhorn in the first Ace Ventura."
2,Fire Birds,"Item arrived very fast and in excellent condition. Highly recommend this seller, it just doesn't get any better than this! The actual movie I would give 2 out of 5 stars, just so so."
3,Fire Birds - Made for TV action drama fluff,"Nicholas Cage, Tommy Lee Jones, Dale Dye.This movie is abit of action/drama made for TV fluff.Great models and some nice flying scenes, more for the Apache than I've ever seen before.Moderate script, some good ALL AMERICAN corny lines, this TV movie was great with pizza and coke and some people who appreciate helicopter air to air/air to ground attack roles.Script could have done with some more beefing up but, great for a lazy movie day."
1,Probably the worst movie ever,"I mistakenly wrote this review for Blue Thunder. I just realized it was Fire Birds that I was thinking of, so I've deleted that review and moved it here.I saw this movie in the theaters when I was around 13. This movie has stood out since then as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so boring. The dialog was horrible, even for someone my age then. I've tried to block this movie from my memory ever since.My daughter just got the Hello Kitty movie. It's more exciting than this movie was. I recommend it over this waste of money."
4,A good action flick,"It's a really good movie if you like action and ESPECIALLY if you like Sean Young. The only complaint I have with it is the fact it doesn't have a smash hit song such as ""Danger Zone"" like Top Gun did."
4,firebirds review,I was pleased with my order. It came quickly with regular shipping methods. It was in new condition.
1,Couldn't be more wrongerererer,"As stated in other reviews, this movie is a joke. Granted the cinematography is good, and there's excitement, but if you film a pig flying and have good cinematography and story, you'd get the same 'excitement'. I also am in Army aviation, and it's disappointing to have such a deviation from the truth filmed. Many movies make some adjustments that border on reality and some go outside that boundary. This movie transcends to another plane of existence and commits suicide. If I were an actor and offered a role in this movie, I would have run away knowing the repercussions it would have on my career."
1,"TERRIBLE,I WANT A GIFT CARD TO MAKE UP FOR THE INCONVENIENCE","THIS IS A COMPLAINT!!THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE,I AM GOING TO SUE YOU PEOPLE FOR THIS HORRIBLE SERVICE.THE PACKAGE TOOK FOREVER TO GET TO MY HOUSE,I JUST HATED THE SERVICE BY AMAZON AND IMPORT CDSTHE MOVIE SUCKED TOO.I WANT A GIFT CARD FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.OR ILL BE SATISFIED IF YOU SEND ME WHAT IS ON MY WISH LIST.I SUGGEST YOU SEND ME WHAT I SAID,BECAUSE THIS PRODUCT WILL GET A BAD NAME"
1,Awful,"This movie was by far the worst I have ever rented. I don't know whether I am more ashamed of the fact I actually paid money to rent it, or that I watched the whole movie start to finish without ripping the vcr power cord from the wall. This movie totally bit off of top gun, which wasn't that great to begin with. A dissolution of suckiness! If you want to torture somebody, chain them to a chair, eyelids peeled open, and make them watch endless replays of this retchid filth. Yuk. sorry had to vent."
1,An Awful TopGun Ripoff,"I do not know the laws for copyright infringement, but this movie must have toed the line pretty well. Change planes for apaches, Tom Cruise for Nick Cage, throw in a few petty plot alterations, and you have this deplorable excuse for a movie."
1,Unrealistic and unfair,"If you know anything about Army aviation or Apaches, Fire Birds will either tick you off, or make you laugh till you puke. This was supposed to be the Army's Top Gun? So sad. It's so unrealistic, I wish the Army had had veto power on this one before it was released."
1,"""firebirds"" flames out fast",nicolas cage is good as the wierd lonner type roles and has an oscar to prove it. however this role calls for more than that you have to be a straght arrow and he isn't. not one good part to this film. i was looking at my watch 5 mins. into this mess. tommy lee jones must have needed the money so i can forget his less than 100 % try as nicks trainner and commander. what a waste of time
1,"So bad, I walked out of the theater","Yes, that's right. Walked out, so ashamed of myself for paying $6 to see it, I didn't even ask for my money back. Yes, it's that bad. I'd give it zero stars if that was possible, but one star will have to do for now. Shamefully bad movie making. Yuk! Ptooey!"
3,enjoyable continuation of series,"I have enjoyed the Weetize Bat series of books and this continues Francesca Lia Block's continuation of Magical Realism for young adults, yet continues themes mature enough for adult readers."
2,Footrest Adjustment Defect,"The footrests come packed locked to their shortest length,a recessed setscrew must be removed with an included hexkey L wrench and then replaced into one of five holes to adjust them longer.The setscrew on the right footrest was either overtightened or crossthreaded at the factory and wouldn't loosen,eventually the hex key wrench stripped out the internal socket of the setscrew.I paid a shop $20.00 to drill out the stripped setscrew and rethread the hole."
4,Drive Transport Chair,This chair is sturdy and well-built. It is very lightweight and easy to fold and put into the car. One improvement that could be made on this chair is the brake handles. They are hard on the hands because they are so thin. Overall it is a wonderful chair and a great help in transporting patients.
2,it ok but not very good,it is fun but not realy and has very bad graphics if you want a good fun game thats not much more get 2010 smackdown vs raw
4,WWE Games,This game is an old game but still fun the control system is not like SVR08 but you have a large selection of move sets and old divas aswell old wrestler that are not part of the company any more. this game for me it is more fun than the new WWE games. getting this game now is not a bad idea if you are looking to play old WWE games.
3,Still the same fun,"Still the same fun as the past years as story mode is pretty good, but animations are outdated and still not as classic as the WWF games on n64."
3,Not bad for a button masher!,"This game is pretty good,The graphics are great,The story line is good.I hate the soundtrack,its for 18 year olds(no custom soundtrack).Stupid songs with only powerchords.It seems if your getting beat by a better player all your doing is trying to get up by pressing a button a million times a match.I love the moves you can do from the create a player menu.The menu for create a player clothes do suck like someone else said.And you cant have your own song coming down the ring.Its cool to see the hart foundation though and the real hulkster legdrop to end a match.All in all a good game."
4,"Dick's Picks, vol. 25",This is a very goodcd. It's one of the better sounding Dick's Picks volumes that I own. I would recommend this CD to any fan of the Grateful Dead.
3,Bittersweet (spoilers),"If Shakespeare had been born in India, Romeo would've been name Raj and Juliet would've been name Meegha. And only one of them would've died foolishly.I'm a fan of Aishwarya, which is the reason I gave this film a try. Someone as lovely and vital as she is was never meant to play a ghost. Of course, being American, I'm of the opinion that not lying to Dad includes telling him something's wrong when he asks. Preferrably INSTEAD OF committing suicide.Was I impressed with Raj, in the long run? Yes, but it was a very long run! One of the subplots, ideally Vicky's, could've been cut and the story wouldn't have lost a thing except the lead in its pants.I won't bother watching this one again, but I won't discourage you from watching it once. Just be sure there's a handkerchief handy, especially at the end."
1,Infantile Mess,My God pure torture for 3.5 hours. A very stupid story about unrequited love. Most Bollywood movies are joyous. This is so misguided that you want to to slit your wrists. such talented actors and music in such a horrible screenplay. Please don't waste your time.
3,This movie is o.k.,"I liked the twist of this story very much, and the way that one personcan not only change a situation, but get the respect that is well deserving."
1,Music majors shouldn't write tech books - should be zero stars,"This book reads like Brosnac had skimmed through a bunch of other books in a wide variety of areas, edited his notes, and slapped a title on it. There is NOTHING covered in depth by this piece of fluff, and I would strongly encourage others to NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
5,All of William Stanek's books are great references,"This edition is at the top of my list of W2K Server resources. I think its written with the assumption that you want to know how and why things work. It is not meant to cover everything resource (try the resource kit and good luck trying to find what you need). This is a great resource with an easy going style understandable by a wide variety of experience levels.Definitely 5 stars. The content is extremely thorough and accurate, the writing style intuitive, and Stanek's obviously an expert in the Enterprise. Check his other books, I think you'll find he is the best of the best when it comes to authoring technical material."
5,Not too much of I.T.,"Basically has everything starting from users and groups and finishing with DHCP. I definately recommend that book for any junior system administrator out there. When i first looked at the size of that little book i thought that it wouldn't be even worth reading, but when i started reading it i realized that i was definately wrong about it. Good explaination for group policies.What i like about these books is that they are small and caneasily fit in any bookpack.(I apologize for any spelling mistakes)"
4,Serves its purpose well.,"Don't expect to learn Windows 2000 by reading this book cover to cover. It's not really designed for that. It is better used as a reference guide for commonly performed system tasks. In that regard, it serves its purpose quite nicely providing solid organization and simple advice.This book serves a definite purpose. It's designed to be the book on the shelf that you use when the inevitable ""How Do I Do This?"" question pops up. It fulfill this purpose well. What this book is not designed for is to fully explain the features of Windows 2000 and Active Directory. There are other titles that do a much better job of that."
4,cute blanket,Very cute good for both genders! Fluffy and soft after washed well! The back is a little rough at first!
4,Pretty good book about project management...,"In layman's language, this is detailed, useful book about thistopic. This book is flexible and can apply to a variety of businesses and projects. A great beginning to this series.I highly recommend The Management Masters Series Corporate Culture if you find this one interesting..."
4,Best bet for the $$$,"This book provides great info in a small pocket size, concise text. If you want to get started in project management start here first. For software project management fields skip it and buy McConnell's 'software project Survival Guide'"
3,"Useful Book, But Not for PMP","This is a useful book on project management: has some useful templates which you can also download from the website. It's easy to read. But, the editorial reviews of this book represent the recent trend to link each PM book to PMI and to its certification PMP. In my opinion, this book is not compatible with the PMI's approach to project management, and therefore is not useful for the PMP exam preparation. Here is the difference: PMI's approach is based on best practices, while this book's approach is based on one person or one school of thought on PM, which is not necessarily a bad thing.The discipline of project management has come a long way on the path of maturity. So, if you are looking for a project management book based on best practices and global standards, or if you are looking for the PMP exam preparation material, this is NOT the right book for you."
5,Verzuh's written the book on getting your ducks lined up.,"If you're attempting to get a clear understanding of project management techniques in a hurry, then look no further. If you've been at this project stuff for years and just need a refresher on the latest language and ideas, then get this book. It's well thought out, well set out, clearly explained and brilliantly presents real-life examples to support the project process. You truly get the sense that the author has been out there in the firing line. Previously I've found project management books make an excellent cure for insomnia, but this one keeps those Grey cells buzzing. And once you've read it, keep it with you for reference. Since getting the book, you can bet I don't travel on a consulting assignment without this little guy stashed somewhere in my carry-on bags."
5,Even if you're MBA-phobic . . .,"My background is in law, and I have avoided business-oriented reading for many years. But I was recently promoted to a VP position that involves a lot of project management and didn't know where else to turn.ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THIS BOOK IS A GOD-SEND. Well-written, concise, easy to follow, with excellent practical examples. I've learned (and successfully applied) something from every paragraph!"
4,Good but not for the PMP Exam,This book is good in gneral...but do not rely on it for the PMP exam..though...
3,introduction to project management,"good book. it gives the idea of managing projects effectively. anyone can read the book and get the things in compact.Algin Erozan, PMP"
4,Several really cute quick projects,"There are several summer shells/tanks in this book (some of the nicest I've seen for crochet), and many hats and bags. Each project is rated with a time estimate--but I've found they take me much longer than the estimate. So I would really argue that the average crocheter could make some of these projects in 24 hours.My biggest pet peeve--books (as this one does) that list the yarn requirements in ounces, not yardage. Unless you are using the exact yarn, ""16 oz"" does not tell you much!"
3,Decent quick patterns,"36 patterns listed in this book. 7 women's tops(one is a really wonderful tank top), 4 purses which aren't that great, 2 scarves, 7 hats, ""hipster scarf"" which looks pretty stupid, 4 afghans(one is a baby afghan and one is granny square), 6 doily coasters, 1 little girls sweater that looks like it is out of the 70s, a little boy's ""footall onesie"" that has an odd look to it like the 7 months old model is wearing the football pads, and adorable baby girl cardigan and hat, and a headband/ear warmer.There is several yarn companies used in this book: Bernat, Crystal Palace, Judi and Company, Lion, Patons, J&P; Coats, Red Heart, and TLC so it is not all high end yarns. Some materials list by yardage some by ounces. The approximate times are also listed. I found that the patterns I made were actually quicker to make than the listed times.I would check this out at the local library before buying it sight unseen."
4,From a Beginner,"This book has a lot of great projects. Also, its good for beginners. I recommend it to my friends."
2,Disappointing,"I received this book as a birthday gift from a former coworker and long-time friend who like me has a vast love of reading books. The book could have benefited from a good editor that would hopefully cut out the all too frequent Christian rhetoric and caught problems such as the duplicate lenghty C.S. Lewis quote that appeared in two sections of the book.The book was at it's best when the authors were quoting secular authors from throughout history, which thankfully was a large part of the book, but not enough large enough to salvage it.The book was at it's worst when original writing and dogma by the authors appeared."
4,Very Good,"One of my favorites of the year. Smart songwriting, nice melodies. Comparisons to other artists (Smith, Drake, etc) are warranted and time will tell if Allen measures up to those guys.Buy it. You'll like it. I swear."
5,WOW!,"The lyrics, the new original music, the voice...wow! What else can I say? I'm so glad I bought this CD and hope to find more by this artist in the future. Is there mailing list I can get on?"
2,Elliott Wannabe,"He's got all the sonic elements in place to be a perfect simulacram of the late, great genius, Mr. Smith..but what's missing is the substance, the soul...this is readily apparent through reading Ashton's lyrics: deep they're not."
2,Good Idea...35 Cents Short,"This is a decent shovel. It has great leverage and can handle snow that is not too heavy (the aluminum construction is light and cannot handle heavy snow). The problem is that the handle is attached to the shovel with a cheap sheet metal screw - which lasts about 15 minutes. I have since bought a larger screw and it lasted another 3 minutes. So, if you buy this shovel, be prepared to drill a proper hole through the other end of the handle and attach the shovel to the handle with a bolt, lock nut and washer. Then you're all set. But Ames could have spent another 35 cents on the shovel and saved you the hassle."
2,Ames True Temper Arctic Blast Shovel,"Buyers should be aware that this shovel is a very soft aluminum, and consequently, if you have any ice or hard packed snow to shovel, this shovel will bend quite easily."
4,Good shovel,"Sadly we have had to use this more this year than any other, but it does what we want it to do."
1,Junk,I must be unlucky but this shovel is junk. The shank is mounted crooked into the blade and the plastic handle at the top is not screwed on so it comes off.Maybe it was a Monday after a holiday when this was assembled.Update: Amazon kindly replaced this shovel but the replacement was little better. It seems the problem is that the assemblers use small screws that are installed with a power drive causing them to strip the threads making them loose.Replacing them with heavier screws and drilling two additional holes to add two more screws makes the shovels serviceable.
4,Snow Shovel usefull as Leave Shovel!,"The tree in front of my house shed it's leaves so much that I had to pick them up by hand to put them in the barrel after raking them up to a pile. This shovel does a much better job. My friend does not like his snow shovel because of the bents, making it somewhat awkward."
2,Below Average,"While I wouldn't put this book among the worst in the Hardy Boys series, it's definitely below average in terms of quality and plot. The story (like many Hardys books) starts out as somewhat interesting and then gets bogged down by boring writing and plot. The boys go to Mexico to find the descendant of an Aztec warrior. Very unoriginal. This book started a long downturn in quality in the series. Every book from Aztec through the Arctic Patrol Mystery is mediocre to terrible. Avoid the mid to late 1960's Hardy boys books if you can."
1,One of the worst,"Of the original 58 titles, this one ranks 57th. It was awful. No mystery, no action, and ABSOLUTELY no creativity. Very poor. Some of the books I've read of a dozen times. I read this one once and that was enough!!"
3,Not That Bad At All!,"I'm a huge mystery fan. By the way, I love The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew, as well. I've read about 80% of all the books in the original Hardy Boys series. This one I read some time ago, and I remembered it because I'm studying the Aztecs in history right now. Anyway, I've read the other customer reviews and it is NOT boring. I agree that the Hardy Boys series declines in qualtiy in terms of excitement and the fresh, original action that captivated so many readers in the first books...but it is NOT unbelievable. NOT put-you-to-sleep boring. NO WAY. Don't believe a word any of those other reviewers wrote. It has a some exciting parts and is pretty good, like all the Hardy Boys books."
5,Lasting Relief,"I have referred many people to Esther Gokhale who were suffering from joint and muscle pain, especially those with back and neck injuries. This DVD is a wonderful tool for people who have back problems, want to take positive steps to feel better, and who want to regain control of their own lives. I am a graduate of Esther's program and nothing has brought me greater relief from my own back problems than the principles that she teaches. It's now three and a half years later and I am still enjoying being pain free and being able to exercise, hike, travel, and play with my grandchildren. I was facing a third surgery involving major fusion and was desperate to find an answer. Esther provided the answer and I literally got my life back. The video does an excellent job of presenting the methods that anyone can easily use on a daily basis to condition, strengthen, and restore their bodies so that they can live pain free. I highly recommend the video."
5,DVD is Gokhale Method in Motion,"I have had back pain for ten years and have pretty much tried everything. Finally!, this method has relieved the pain in my lower back! I have always had poor posture, and The Gokhale Method truly relieves my spinal discomfort with just a few important changes in my stance. The DVD is the book in motion. If you feel that you can't get from the book exactly what she is wanting you to do, or you don't hve time to sit down and read it, then the DVD is invaluable. The instructions in the book were very clear, but sometimes it's nice to see something in action!"
3,Not terrible...,"This wasn't a terrible book. The story takes place in a bedroom after smoking a couple of joints. We are treated to the narration from the paranoid mind of the main character, whose ruminations, while painfully unceasing, at times are insightful. I understand where Nadas was trying to go with this, but I think, even with the short length, that without any breaks in the narration from the schizophrenic to a normal mind, many people would likely lose patience, if not pull their hair out.To the lone reviewer before me, you have mistaken a spot-on drug induced dialogue as immature, childish rantings. While seemingly similar, Art is what separates the two. Just like the abstract painting someone loves which turns out to be a wiping rag.Even with it's faults, I will keep this one to read again."
3,Solipsistic mind-trip,"This short book takes place over a single night, as a couple smoke hallucinogenic drugs, and the male narrator trips deeper and deeper into his own mind. His existential mental ramblings are a chore to keep up with at times, but it's also (what I would imagine to be) an incredibly realistic portrayal of a drug trip. At times I was with the narrator, with his fears of going insane and feeling on the brink of death and his philosophical realizations on the nature of love and reality. Other times the stunted writing and repetition lost me. But all in all, a very interesting and strange book - provocative in its own way, if a bit flawed in overall execution and conclusion."
1,Wrong color no sizing chart,"I purchased these thinking I'd get what was in the picture. Navy is actually Royal and what they sent me. The color shown is more like cyan. There is no sizing chart, and it's impossible to get the right size without it. XL does not fit size 40. So I'm out the shipping both ways. I might as well donate it to goodwill! So I feel like a dog took a doo doo on me. I really despise companies that don't put up sizing charts. Also, this is America and large Chinese is not large USA."
4,shorts,These Dolfin shorts were perfect. They were lightweight and dried fast. Recently used them on a trip to Hawaii. Aloha
3,a little spendy for the quality i think but not bad,I liked the sign but I was expecting it to be made of harder plastic. I personally don't feel its worth 10 dollars but to each his own and I think my husband will like it. It's not like the cool metal type ones that the lettering is sorta punched out but rather flat. My husband is deployed and I have yet to send it to him so I am hoping he likes it. Its thick plastic and bends but not real cheap plastic. I was satisfied for the most part.
1,Very Old Style,"The pluses: a flashlightThe minuses: Can't swivel it left or right, has very limited up and down positions, in fact can't be positioned downward at all. Lacks ability to focus beam. Very limited utility. Like a flashlight of the forties. Very clumsy and not clever in its design!"
2,Buyer Beware - Revised Review - See Update Below,"ORIGINAL REVIEW:I just received this item. The pluses: nicely designed flashlight and can serve as convenient emergency light (as long as you keep your batteries charged), even has extra bulb built in. The minuses: lacks ability to focus beam and can pinch finger when pivoting head downward. For this price, I would have hoped that it would have had the ability to focus which is in virtually all quality flashlights.UPDATED INFORMATION - My second light bulb failed (because I dropped the flashlight). I had no idea how difficult it was to find the bulbs and at what cost. The bulb is a 15.6 volt 0.7 amp xenon bulb. Panasonic parts sells the bulb for $7.31 plus shipping, which is ridiculous. According to another website, the bulb is rated for only 15 hours life. I was finally able to find the bulb for under $3.00 plus shipping.I am dropping my rating from 4 starts to 2 stars."
3,"Ok, but too expensive and can't find bulbs!","This is an ok item, certainly not worth $40.00. It lacks the ability to focus the beam. Replacement bulbs are impossible to find.I purchased this on a special offer and do use it frequently. I'd buy another one for $15.00, but any more than that I would put my money into something better, with easy to find replacement bulbs."
5,"Great Light, Great Customer Service","Timely delivery of product, love the lamp, stable base and tilt are very useful. Aim it up or aim it down at what you are working on. Now, if I can only get it away from my 5 year old. But, what stands out is the vendor's customer service. It was believed the delivery was not made. My children picked up box and stashed it away (of course they never saw it). Questioned delivery and vendor immediately issued moved to reissued the product that same day and file a claim for a missed delivery. No questions asked! Fortunately, I found the ""stashed"" box and was able to cancel the second delivery and clear the delivery claim. Could not ask for better service, especially when the error was on my side."
4,Southern sin,"Supposedly based on a true story from the life of the author growing up in West Virginia. As I was reading this I was reminded of ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" as it is a story that is too good to be true. It is hard to believe that this isn't entirely a piece of fiction but it is based on events that took place in 1928-33. I have a hard time believing that the author's family got away with everything the author claims they did. (I do believe the stories regarding the Klan.) This is a great story with murder, suicide and insanity that wraps you into the life of the characters (if you read it with a grain of salt)."
5,What an awesome book!,"I just finished reading this book and I absolutely loved it! You never knew what was going to happen next. What made it even more enjoyable was the fact that I live in the same town where the story takes place. I do have to admit, at some points the story became a little bizarre, but maybe that's what made it so captivating. Great story!!!"
1,Couldn't finish it after first few pages,"I love a good gothic novel, especially Southern, but I was so turned off by the first few pages that I gagged and couldn't read anymore. Sexual act and a seven year old? Ugh!!!"
2,Not a fan of this wedge,"I bought the 10"" wedge for help in bed and I was unimpressed with the fabric of the cover. It felt cheap and less than even hospital grade. The foam is not as firm as I expected and the slope is slightly too steep to be comfortable.The 2 stars is for quick shipping and safe packaging."
4,"Duro-Med Bed Wedge 10"" X 24"" X 24""",The company shipped the item faster than promised. It is sturdy and seems durable. I like the removable cover because it can be laundered. The wedge can be used a number of ways which makes it more versatile than I realized it would be.
1,Too High!,"I ordered this from Amazon and it shipped from Vitality Medical. Without having ever used one of these, I opted for the medium height wedge thinking it would be ok. It propped me up much too high and although it would be ok for watching TV, it is much too high for sleeping comfortably. Because of the height, you may slide down the pillow thus disrupting the support of your lower back. The height made me feel like I was in an unnatural position and thus could not fall asleep. Here's an important note: BEWARE IF YOU NEED TO RETURN IT - IT WILL COST YOU MORE TO SHIP IT BACK THAN WHAT YOU ORIGINALLY PAID FOR IT. Even when I asked the merchant if I could simply exchange it for the 7"" wedge, I was told that I had to pay for the return AND pay to have the replacement shipped. Fortunately for me, I was able to find another merchant who offered free shipping. My 7"" wedge that I have now is perfect!"
2,bed wedge,"if you can bear the hard material used , then you can buy it ... i had to put a pillow on top first, then a pad inserted inside the case to soften it but i'm still not satisfied ...."
5,Sweet Memories,"I had this very book when I was a child, and was so excited to find it to share with my son. It was one of my childhood favorites, and is now one of his. He loves it so much that he asks for me to recite it to him after tucking him into bed! A definite Christmas favorite."
5,Great candy!,Unfortunately I love these and just placed my third order. I have sworn off most sweets except these as they are my guilty pleasure. The orders usually arrive quickly and I have had no problem with packaging. Nice to have around the house for visiting kids and around the office.
3,"candy ok, packaging not so much","candy ok and will serve its purpose. ordered a total of 15lbs of candy which the merchant saw fit to send into one USPS flat rate box. needless to say, it was in shreds when I received it. with all the money spent on shipping (over $30) they could have split the order. lucky everything was still in it..."
5,The Pumpkin/Winter Squash recipe inspired me to write!,"I have made four recipes out of this book since receiving it at Christmas. Each one was so good, but the Pumpkin/Winter Squash recipe (p. 109) inspired me to write! My husband and I ate it right when it came out of the machine and it was sooooooo good! Moist, pumpkiny, spicy and hot. With a little butter on a slice, it was the best bread I had eaten in months. The book is worth buying just for that one recipe."
4,Delicious bread with little effort!,"This was my first bread machine cookbook other than the one that came with my machine. I have tried at least 15 different recipes, and have been pleased with the majority of them. My 20 month old daughter loves the bread and I love making bread using wholesome ingredients. I found the instructions very easy, and the ingredients easy to find in the supermarket, if I didn't already have them at home. A great book for beginners as well as those with more experience."
5,Our favorite bread machine book since 1993.,"We got this book with our first bread machine shortly after we got married, and we keep coming back to it, even though we have owned other books and other bread machines in the last 19 years. Our book is full of notes and ratings. Favorites over the years have included French Honey bread, Cottage Cheese bread, Oregano bread, Sour Cream bread, Bagels (they are honey - whole wheat, Delish!), Sally Lunn bread, Cheddar Cheese bread, Cinnamon Raisin bread, Sweet Potato bread, and cinnamon rolls. We kept a sourdough starter going for a few years, so I know that we liked that, although I didn't take notes on any of those breads for some reason (you go through phases, I guess). I like, though, that there is such a variety in breads that now that I am more interested in whole grains, there is a whole section of the book I am about to try, and it will probably take me another 20 years to try out all the recipes I intend to make. This book is a keeper."
4,Correcting mistakes early,"It would be a good idea to have certain products ahead of time so you could choose the bread anytime. Yeast, Soda, Dry Milk and Buttermilk powder, some dried fruits and nuts, cornmeal, rye and white and whole wheat flour , margarine, cinnamon, oil, eggs and others. Start with the smallest loaf. I had trouble getting several loaves out of the pan and I took the tops of several loaves when I raise the lid.Be sure everything is at room temperature and warmed water. Remember your filtered water if you have a filter.I make such messes that a large white bath towel helps in a small kitchen."
3,"It's ok, don't understand the rave reviews","I just got a sunbeam breadmaker and got this cookbook based on the rave reviews I've read on Amazon. So far although I've tried quite a few recipes from this book there hasn't been one that I would want to make again. They just don't taste very good. I actually prefer the bread recipes in the instruction booklet that came with my bread machine, so I'll most likely not keep this book."
5,"If you buy only one bread book, this is the one","I bought this book and the Betty Crocker bread book. This is the one we use -- the advice and information is straight forward, knowledgeable and works! The recipes are wonderful. We do not buy any store bought bread; we make all our own and this book has the kind of bread recipes you'll use day-to-day. No it's not fancy and there are no pictures, but you don't need them. The descriptions are spot on and the bread comes out beautifully using the advice and recipes in this book. If you are buying just one book to use with your bread machine, buy this one!"
1,"Adjust, Adjust, Adjust","I have tried 10 or so recipes from her book and each one has required extensive adjustment with water or flour to come even close to a decent loaf. The recipes sound great but turn out to be a disappointment. Some of her instructions are vague. A real disappointment. I know it's not me, because other recipes from other books turn out just fine"
4,"""borrowed"" this book from friend and ""forgot"" to give back","great book, good recipes. Never a dud in the bunch. I highly recommend this book.daryl"
4,bread recipes,better and less costly recipes are found here than in the cookbooksupplied with the breadmaker.
2,"So far, the recipes fail to turn out properly.","Of the two recipes I have tried thus far (I just bought the book), neither one has turned out properly despite meticulous following of the author's instructions. The dough consistently is either too loose or too dense...I'm not the best cook, but I do know how to follow directions. Her recipe for ""peasant bread"" managed to burn-out the motor on my machine, so use this book at your own risk!"
5,Wonderful Book,I bought this book for my mother and both sheand myshelf love the book. The bread is great.
1,mind confusion,"Whatever the plot was suppose to be, this movie left me dangling in the end. At first it appeared to be about people who possessed psychic abilities were being used by a madman. It then switched to a Branch Davidian Compound style stronghold containing weapons that would make the military envious. Here they attempted to whitewash what happened and how the poor FBI were the real victims as pregnant mothers mowed them down with automatic weapons and rocket launchers. The fun doesn't stop here. Now one of the women who was suppose to be a victim of the cult leader helps the crooked senator who authorized the assault on the cult compound get elected president only to shoot him in the end squeaky Fromme style."
4,Acute Insight,"As Conrad Black points out in his biography, Richard Nixon was known as a frequent user of code words: ""Peoria"" to indicate any American Heartland locale, ""Upper Volta"" for any third-world place, etc. So it's entirely plausible that Nixon was indeed referring to the JFK assassination in his references to the ""Bay Of Pigs thing"" as Haldeman says. Fascinating stuff."
1,The Haldeman Diaries: Only what I want you to know,"I bought this book looking for more insight into the Watergate affair from a man that was on the front lines. What I got was a dairy from a man that continued the policy from the 70's, that is deny, deny, deny. What a shame that a dairy can't even be honest."
2,Not as good as prior book. More a daily notepad than story,"A reader said that the book was a continuation of the 1970s policy-deny,deny, deny.First of all, it was not a story or an analysis. Read Haldeman's prior book, THE ENDS OF POWER for that sort of thing.Second, the DIARIES were more like a 5 1/2 year daily memo pad, talking about the day to day operations, from the mundane to the high charging.Put that in your blowhole and smoke it!"
5,Best Book Ever Written!,"Poignant nonfiction work depicting the life of vegetables and how members of the human race can interact with plants to increase their quality of life, ergo their productivity."
2,Terrible,What you have here is a rather boring and quite stupid scrip with some pretty bad acting! Its unfortunate too as Steven Seagal is one of the few muscle men in Hollywood that is quite a talented actor.
1,Bad,"I've watched most of Segal's films, and I own several as well. But this film is one of the worst films I've seen in the last ten years. Excepting for a chance to look at Jacqueline Lord (a Catherine Zeta Jones look, act, and dress alike) for a little while, and her acting wasn't very good most of the time, there are no redeeming aspects to this film.For a film in the action genre, it consists of ALL bad elements. The plot actually had potential, except the dialog is on the level of a bad High School film. Segal is so over-weight that you can tell he's struggling to do even the most basic martial arts sequences. Unless he can lose weight and get into shape, this is the last film of his I'll spend any time watching.Unfortunately, the sets, the action, the dialog, the acting, the directing, and so forth, are all between the D+ to C levels of quality.I'd rather have seen a corny Kung Fu movie. At least there would have been some excuse for so many bad elements in one film.Avoid this film totally."
4,works as advertised,works as advertised. a bit of a nuisance as in where to put it. i have mine under my deck. On my deck pioneer deh 9800BT it feels as if it was meant to be there. USB comes up as an option on the screen and once the mp3s are tagged properly it displays two lines of text. one for artist and one for song title. It also reads my 160 GB WD hard drive if conected straight to the adaptor without the extension..
3,EXPIRATION DATE PROBLEM.........,"Received 12, 5 oz bags of croutons today with an expiration date of 10/09/2012. Not okay!!. Opened first bag with very fresh croutons; however, the closure strip do not work, therefore, presents another con with this purchase. The price was right and received in the time limit quoted. Even praise the freshness of first bag of croutons. Seller really needs to work on a longer expiration date."
1,markincg,This is a piece of junk that didn't last more than a couple of months before several things began to break down. Don't waste your money.
1,Why Couldn't these People Leave Sly Alone? The Biggest Tribute Is To Buy Sly's Catalogue,"Sly was one of the greatest music artists that needs no reworking or tampering with.The music stands by itself.The amazing grooves he laid down and his major influence on so many of his contemporaries is cheapened by this reworking of his music by artists whom may be his grandchildren but did not learn anything from the purity and authenticity of the soul and excitement Sly laid down.Isaac Hayes, you may be older now but man, stick to the grace of your ""Black Moses"" sound when you were an original voice...Aerosmith singing Sly? Come On...Moby? your music is so far removed from the soul,funk,vibes that Sly created it is a perfect wonder that you are on this CD at all...I can see a posthumous tribute but this is not the way to experience the man when his recordings sounds so vital and fresh even today.Get the near perfect Essential Sly or the classic 1 cd Greatest Hits and you will see what I mean..."
4,Sly Stone's Music is Great No Matter Who Is Singing It!,"Do not allow the negative critiques of this cd deter you. Sly's music is great no matter who is doing it. If you are a die-hard Sly Stone fan and have been wishing for a new album from this very reclusive star, then jump on this one. It's a complete re-working of his masterpieces and the great thing is that they have incorporated Sly's original music and vocals into the mix. I have EVERY Sly Stone cd in his discography and it was interesting to hear different twists on his compositions. Just listen to Buddy Guy on You Can Make It If You Try or Scar/Cee-lo/Big Boi & DJ Swiff on You Caught Me Smilin' and you'll know what I mean. Of course they aren't as great as the originals, but, we've heard them all before.This is one of the most intriguing recordings I've heard. It's fresh, new, and very innovative. And most importantly, it was not only PRODUCED by SLY STONE... but, he had much input in the final product."
1,Skip the Funktologist/ A Funk Above The Rest Show,"No, no, no! Who's idea was this? Why did you take music that was made with ""all natural ingredients"", and remake them with ""artificial ones? Surely, Sly is getting sick to his stomach..."
1,"Big Time Corny,go buy the Originals","Sly Stone is One of the Greatest Musical Forces to Ever Rock this Planet&this is the best He can get as a tribute? that show the other night was pretty bad,except when Sly Stone re-emerged,that truly made my night seeing a Artist who always did his own thing. anyway this album is really lame on a whole.The Roots&Robert Rudolph are the only semi interesting acts on this project. but this is a dud tribute to Sly&the Family Stone who truly deserve better."
5,My Best CD!,"I cannot undestand a word of spanish, but for this CD you don't need to. Belinda's voice is all that matters. This cd is the best I own (along with my Instant Star Soundtracks)She is such a wonderful singer, and a few of her songs have both Spanish and English. I love every single song on this CD, but my personal favorite is Contigo O Sin Ti (which translates into With You Or Without You) I LOVE the music. This song is both english and spanish, I listen to it non-stop. I can't wait for her next CD (that is hoping she makes another). YOU ROCK BELINDA!"
2,It blocks all the time,"I can't say the reason, but this card blocks all the time, after some days without use. For unblock it, I have to take it out many times and clean contacts. Then, without knowing exactly what worked, it begins to function."
1,Not as advertised.,I returned it. It was sleepwear and not a camp shirt. Should have been listed as sleepwear.
4,interesting movie,I saw this movie years ago and wanted to show my daughter. She said it was scary to imagine this could happen.
4,Classic - Great,This original version is much better than the remake. In this original we get to see Tom Sellick before he was famous. This was an old movie from 1978 but my wife had not seen it and she was thrilled. (Kept my attention too)
3,Still good viewing,The movie has managed to stand its time quite well and does not seem overly aged when presented today. Michael Douglas role and his interpretation is not something to write home about but there are quite a few interesting performances in smaller parts by actors later becoming quite known (see how many you can spot)The topic is ever more relevant these days and thus keeping the movie relevant to todays audiences despite its flaws.
3,Coma film,"This is an adequate but not exciting SciFi-medical thriller. It's entertaining but not a ""keeper"" film. To quote Abraham Lincoln: just the thing for people who like that sort of thing."
1,Credibility,"I really don't know how to write about the consistent lack of elementary credibility in this dated Hollywood factory production without spraying spoilers all over the screen. Some are so bad they are an insult to the viewer and one, with an ambulance ride by Dr Wheeler (I did not spoil anything) is a downright, guffaw generating howler. As they say, they coulda done better, but didn't, or couldn't. I wasted my time. Felt had, flim-flammed again. I know this is not a good review. My advice: Buy it. You'll see. finis"
4,"Put yourself in a ""Coma""-VHS style","""Coma"" is a taut medical thriller which intrigues viewers from the first ten minutes of the film. Dr. Susan Wheeler watches a good friend lapse into an irreversible coma after a routine surgery. Her love interest is trying to snag the next chief of surgery title playing hospital politics, and is encouraged to stop Susan's quest to find answers to an alarming problem of comas in her own hospital. If you like suspense movies, medical drama, love affairs, or all 3, this is the movie for you. I found a terrific copy of it in VHS on Amazon.com."
3,The Hippocratic Oath is out the window...,"to say the least.Yes, there's a lot of harm done to patients at their most defenseless, at Boston Hospital, in a conspiracy to harvest organs for the black market.Coma is not a fantastic film, but very interesting, suspenseful and has real good acting, especially by Widmark and Torn. Michael Douglas made his jump to the big screen around this time. Bujold does a competent job, considering she's burdened with having to carry most of the film.The film's subject matter is disturbing, where corrupt doctors violate such an important trust. And (spoiler ahead) this feeling culminates when a robotic Nurse Ratched-like overseer of the Jefferson Institute turns out to be...an auctioneer -- just a sad comment on the state of regard for human life, yikes.And the film will keep you guessing about who's good, who's bad, who can be trusted, and who can't.A simple bare-bones DVD is all you need for this one, no need for extras."
4,Eeerily plausible thriller,"Like many Michael Critchon films, there is good attention to scientific detail. Also, authentic-sounding PA announcements pervade the film (as they do in the Andromeda Strain, Westworld and Jurassic Park). Creepy Jerry Goldsmith score almost completely absent until just before the appearance of the ""Jefferson Institute"". Elizabeth Ashley is superb as the robotic-like head of the Institute. Note microphone intrusion at top of picture during surgeons' mess-room scenes. Anatomy room scenes are particularly unsettling."
1,Good Movie - Bad DVD !!,"Very good movie, remember seeing it in the theater......But, the DVD is awful. No features, poor transfer, and to top it a terrible sound track .... Mono !!!The only good think about the DVD is it is 1.85 Anamorphic, enhanced for WS TV's."
5,Pretty Decent Thriller featuring a Pre-Star Douglas,"Starring Bujold and Douglas, ""Coma,"" based on Crighton's best-selling novel, is an entertaining thriller about the clandestine ""goings on"" at a big city hospital. Bujold is good as the investigative doctor, torn between her duty and desire to get to the bottom of the mystery. Douglas, as her boyfriend, doubts the veracity of her claims, but learns almost too late that Bujold's conspiracy theory is right.Veterans Rip Torn and Elizabeth Ashley are appropriately menacing while Richard Widmark is the ""kind"" hospital administer who listens to Bujold's concerns. Look carefully for a pre-""Magnum"" Tom Selleck as a patient.The movie also sports a good Jerry Goldsmith score!"
4,Strong Triller From Micheal Crichton.,"Micheal Chichton(West World) did the film Screenplay and He also Directed the film, Thought this film is NOT, Based on one of his Novels(Jurassic Park,Rising Sun, Disclosure,The 13th Warrior). The Film, based on the novel by Robin Cook.This is a Medical Thriller about a Female Doctor, Played by Genevieve Bujold(EarthQuake, David Cronenberg`s Dead Ringers) about Increasingly Patients are falling in to Comas. She investage by Herself to Find Out Why? and Nobody Believe her story, could lead to a Possible Conspiracy Plot, Doctors are Murdering The Patients are putting them to Comas, Not Even her Doctor Boy Friend, Played by Micheal Douglas(The War Of The Roses, The Game, Wonder Boys).This Smart Thriller, i seen it for the recently shown in a Movie Channel. Look For Early Very Small Roles, Before and Ed Harris(The Knightraiders,Creep Show, The Abyss and The Truman Show). Grade:B+."
4,Sons of the Lost Regiment,"The Lost Regiment is back! Actually, they are the ""Sons of the Lost Regiment"" for the most part. Andrew Keane and Pat O'Donald are now politicians, but their sons and a second generation of the 35th Regiment are in the thick of the action. Forstchen manages to find yet another horde, the Kazan, to threaten the Rebublic. It is somewhat repetetive, but you still can't help but get excited when the Yankees have to find another way to fight against impossble odds - think Battle of Midway. The good news is that this next generation of characters promises a whole new series of conflicts of good vs. evil. Forstchen even sets the stage for future conflict with a ""master race"" of humans bred by the Kazan. An excellent read. Welcome back Lost Regiment, I can't wait for the next installment."
3,disappointed & abandoned!,"Don't buy this book! The author writes a series of volumes that continue the story/saga but, he never brings the continuing story to a definitive end. In ""Down to the Sea"", (last volume in the series), Mr. Forstchen ends with a promise to continue the saga but, as of this date...nothing. If I would of knew this, I would of never purchased any of his books.Be forewarned! Because you will be disappointed and abandoned!"
4,Something new and something old.,Not great but not bad either just what I have come to expect from this author which I thought was the stuff of great books 5 years ago but now that I'm a little older I can see the problems. The main one seems to be that character development is often sacrificed to move the story along. Like in this book we are told that it is 20 years later and that many people that readers learned to love from previous books are now dead. The exact circumstances of these deaths are immaterial for the most part and the main thing that matters is the overall story arch apparently. I have to say that while the book was uneven in some places the new generation does show promise.
4,Don't start what you don't plan on finishing.,"This is a very good addition to the fantastic Lost Regiment series except.....Where's the next one? You left us hanging.And while I'm whining, where's the sequel we were specifically promised to 1945?"
3,Leaves many gaps,"When writing a series book like this that has a multifacetd storyline and variables it helps to not leave people hanging and have more consistency. For instance we know its 20 years later but little is said about what has happened then. Having a timeline chart would be helpful. Another would be a worldmap. This has always been a complaint of this series which the author did include in book #8. In this one we have no idea about what countries are in the Republic, where the major rivers, oceans, and cities are, or where the campaigns are taking place. Also there is alot of mention of the alien technology in the previous books. I find it hard to believe that in 20 years the humans hadn't visited all the ancient horde sites or deciphered the sacred scrolls. Finally while most of the book is a good page turner the ending, as in book #8, is too chopped off. But all in all I still reccomend the book and I look forward to the next."
4,mmhmm,"Samurai versus a bunch of cowboys. What could possibly go wrong with that combination. Not much actually since the game is quite fun. It is challenging and there are a lot of unlockable weapons, accessories, and characters. Definitely worth checking out."
5,The bassist's 'Bathroom Reader',"For the casual reader, the serious bookworm, and everybody in between - this should appeal to everyone who is interested or intruiged by the evolution of music with the Electric Bass. It all started here, and rock music as we know it would never be the same without the instrument pioneered 50 years ago by Leo Fender.This book spans, in detail, the life (and death) of Fender basses... from the prominent Precision Bass, to the unique Jazz Bass, and even the concept 1970's 5-string short-scale bass which would never be seen again in the market. It will show you photographs of the Fender team in action... and much more.In the back of the book, you will find descriptive explainations of the changes the basses underwent in the 50 years of existance... right down to the Tuning Keys, Bridges, and Decals.This book is a treasure to me - if I ever lost it, I would buy another one without hesitation."
4,A Good Resource,"This is a good resource for Fender bass collectors or those interested in starting a vintage instrument collection. There are plenty of photos and information to help research the date of a Fender bass, or just to look at and wish you had one. It was also interesting to see the ads used throughout the years and the colors/options available."
5,The things I never knew!,"What can I say about this book? Frankly, after playing Fender basses exclusively for almost 30 years, I thought that I knew everything about every style of Fender bass ever made. WRONG! This book not only is a great coffee-table ""picture book,"" it also goes into the roots of why and how particular changes and/or upgrades were made over the years.This was truly a fun and educational eye-opener for me. I just can't put this book away! I say Fender forever!!"
2,I expected so much more.,"A gross disappointment. I expected much more detailed information about the individual bass parts. There was great information on the different bridge types. But I had hoped that there would be more information on the pickguard colors for each year of production and the different knob types but it wasn't there. If you have a Precision or Jazz bass the book is OK.They have a few pics of the Mustang bass and the Tele bass but you don't learn anything about Japanese or Mexican made basses.I had really hoped for a more complete book. The book should have been twice as thick. The book is an ""illustrated history"" of the Fender Bass. For me that is a problem. It is really a picture book for adults and not really a reference book.To be fair the book does have great glossy pictures of the guitars. But they left out the cases and other things I thought they would be covering in the book."
1,heavy transport wheelchair,"From the other reviews and the price, I was looking forward to this transport wheelchair but I was not happy with it. It was heavy and the back support on the right was broken. I tried to snap it on but it would not hold. This could have seriously injured my disabled dad. The worse part was trying to put all the materials back into the box and ship it. I will pay more for a better and defintely lighter transfer chair."
2,"Great Price, Too Heavy!","This item was reordered 2 x's , both times it was badly packed and arrived with broken armrests.Also the wrong color was sent both times. The wheels were also very stiff. It is also too heavy and awkward to be used as an easy fold transport char. The return process was fast, however the credit to my account took over 2 weeks. Go for the aluminum model with the slanted armrests, it is worth the additional cost."
3,"mis-teeq,likin on both sides",this album has wiked beets and sum good r&b souls.it is worhth buyin but if u dont like mis teeq raps then leave it.it has all there recent hits on it and a reallt good tune wiv so solid in it!i wuld give it 7 or 8 out of 10
4,Essays about unlucky people going to prison because of stupid laws,"I bought this book and ""Three Felonies a Day"" at the same time. This book is much better in that it talks about cases against normal, everyday people and how they ran afoul of the law. ""Three Felonies a Day"" was a big disappointment. Unless you want to read about politicians and wall streeters getting in trouble. I couldn't relate to them. This book is much closer to home and gives stories of people you can relate to."
3,"Cute, sturdy, but not big enough","My son received this for his one year birthday. At first he was not attracted to it because it doesn't make any sounds and no lights flash. Once he learned how to open the back, he becamse interested in stuffing his security blanket in there. However, he gets frustrated when he tries to load bigger things, like more than one small ball, in there. I would like the toy better if it didn't have the handle; this would creat more room. He never wants to carry it around anyway."
3,Not What I Expected,For some reason this wasn't what I expected. I really love Rosemary Clooney in White Christmas and expected some great songs. This album was okay but some of the songs sounded like it may be have later in her life and you could hear the age in her voice. It's a good CD but just not what I had hoped for.
1,Need to know which parts they have in stock,"I drive a 1998 Plymouth Neon (thanks for your sympathy) and ordered the radiator cooling fan from this company. Instead, I received the air conditioning cooling fan. Normally, no big deal, except that the 2 fans used in this car ar edifferent because of the height of the motor for the fan. The air conditioning drip condenser fan had a very tall motor, because of its location, but the radiator fan has a shorter motor because it sits between the radiator and the exhaust headers.Normally, this is no big deal, but there is no contact with the seller, and I am forced to resort to simply ordering the correct fan from a different source.The product works with no problem as it was intended - an air conditioning drip condenser fan, but not what I ordered it for.I recommend the product, but not this seller."
2,American Experience Reagan.,"PBS's take on history(leftist history),On A Great Man like Reagan, Of course you can't expect much from Public Broadcasting and their lilly eastern liberal views.It's nice to watch cause it's Reagan,but focuses on what they believe is the negative and what is essentially myths,Liberals are always foaming at the mouth at the mere mention of Reagan,because they know none of their ""Holy"" leaders were or will ever compare to Reagan and Reagan Conservatism."
2,A dismal compilation complete with liberal skew,"This video contains such a liberal bias that it sickened me to watch it. If you don't know the truth about this wonderful man, this documentary can only cause you to come to the wrong conclusion about him. I found it disheartening to listen to the emotionally driven, untrue commentary about Reagan and his presidency, all set to dismal, depressing, and gloomy music seemingly chosen to convey the feeling of a funeral or a holocaust movie.Reagan was a good man. Reagan was a great American. Everyone who knew him liked him. He never talked down to anybody. He was an humble human being who acted in the best interest of this nation. He deserves better."
1,NOT Balanced!! It Deserves NO Stars:,"This video deserves 0 stars, and that's what I'd put if it were an option. Clearly written by a left-winger with an axe to grind.This video is NOT fair and balanced. Go elsewhere if you want to see an accurate portrayal of one of our nations greatest Presidents and everything he TRULY accomplished."
1,Not How I Remember Him,"I read Edmund Morris' biography (if you can call it that) and I saw this video on PBS. Both do little to explain the phenomenal popularity of Reagan's presidency and both are a disservice to his memory. If you're a big fan of Reagan, like me, I suggest you pick up a compilation tape of his speeches (the Great Communicator Box Set is the most complete one I've found). I think that's the best way of reliving the memories of a great president."
3,Fairly boring,"With all due respect to Alex Chilton, and the Posies (whom I love), this collection of songs is very just-OK, leaning toward boring. Some folks might enjoy it (witness some of the reviews) but don't expect necessarily to do so."
2,Big Star In Space Sucks!,"Jody Stephens thought Ken Stringfellow and Jon Aur would be good for a Big Star reunion. Bad idea! The two guys from The Posies make Big Star sound like fluff. Big Star In Space ruins the reputation and legend of Alex Chilton and Jody Stephens. There are better choices for musicians to become part of a Big Star reunion. Alex and Jody should give the two posies the boot and start from scratch. There is still a masterpiece Big Star album waiting to be written, recorded and released. In Space is an embarrassment compared to the songs and musicianship of # 1 Record and Radio City. Save your money and order vinyl copies of Big Stars early albums from Acoustic Sounds. I got Radio City and # 1 Record on vinyl and they sound incredible."
5,Quit Yer Moanin',"I mean for god's sake it's most of Big Star after 30 years! We should be groveling at the feet of Alex Chilton in fanatical thanks! Those Posies are incredibly lucky and they know it.Listen to Love Revolution again - they are cracking up the whole time. They're having so much fun with that song, how can you not LOVE IT?? I usta have a Disco Sucks tee but I've been referring to myself as Disco Fox lately.I'm just so glad Alex wasn't washed away in his New Orleans home during Katrina - he was one of the first folks I axed my N.O. peeps about. I'm happy to hear him doing ANYTHING.PS: There's a Love Revolution mp3 RINGTONE at this site:http://www.funtonia.com/mp3ringtones/songs/Big_Star/Love_Revolution/I'd love to get it but am suspicious - I assume there will be tons of hidden fees and resulting spam.... But if anyone buys it, email me and let me know if the company sucks or not. tcassin@emory.edu"
3,Sounds influenced by Big Star,"A perfectly nice pop record that sounds halfway like an Alex Chilton album from the past two decades (lots of goofy R & B and garage rock) and halfway like (pick your favorite Big Star derivative: Posies, Teenage Fanclub, Velvet Crush, Imperial Teen...). Which means that it's a Big Star record in name and half its personnel only--because what made Big Star unique was that they sounded a lot more desperate than perfectly nice while cranking out the indelible hooks. So don't necessarily avoid--but don't be disappointed if what you hear sounds nothing like Radio City and only a little bit like #1 Record."
2,Gratutious and Graphic,"Eileen Goudge evidentally loves the fictional town and characters she has created and Carson Springs does sound like a heavenly place. But as a casual reader (who might only get to read 5 to 10 pages at a sitting), I found there were too many characters to keep up with, too many pronouns to figure out who was who, and that the graphic and unimaginative insertions of ""love scenes"" were more gratutious than necessary for the plot line. It was fun to see the Anna character grow (or shrink?), and the plot lines and mystery seem forced, unrealistic and unlikely."
2,Disappointed reader,"I usually love Elaine Goudge's books, but this one was a disappointment to me. I enjoyed the first Carson Springs Taste of Honey but the next two weren't quite as good. This book, Wish Come True is certainly not the best of the three. Too many characters to keep up with, I had to keep looking back to see who's who. I couldn't really get into this book though I stayed with it to the end. I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,"good, big, basic","What more can be said? This is a big, basic, cooker that does its job. The only detractor was that there was an errata sheet included explaining that the controls were put on backwards, such that high meant low and low meant high. That seems a pretty big deal when paying for something you think is not a factory second, but with an Amazon Gift Certificate and free shipping, I got it for 4 bucks, so I can't complain too much!"
1,Cracked after only 5 uses!,"Purchased this item for myself, and was excited to use it. After only 5 uses, dinner was found to be inside the stainless steel portion of slow cooker, due to the ceramic portion cracking. Unrepairable. Worked well for those 5 uses though."
1,Poorly Manufactured,"The first time I used this crock pot I discovered that the liner has very tiny cracks around the sides and does not hold liquid. It appears to have been poorly manufactured, as there is no evidence of rough handling. Of course whatever you're trying to cook goes onto the heating element and burns."
5,It's BIG!!!,"I sent this to my son in FL who is single and lives alone. Then I went to visit him. I realized that I should have sent this size Slow Cooker to my daughter who has 3 children and a husband because it definitely is too big for a single guy. I don't know how well it works because I did not use it. I just wanted to mention that if you want a BIG cooker, this is the one for you!"
1,defective product by a company of swindlers,Once received the meat grinder did not grind at all because of defective plate/knive set. Kalorik has ignored my inquiries about the warranty nor they wanted to communicate with me. It looks like after their product is sold they don't want to deal with customers anymore. How such company of swindlers and thieves can be in the market?
2,pretty bad,"the authors simply don't know how to present their stuff in an orderly fashion. looks like a rushed job.go look at John Gough's ""Compiling for the .NET Common Language Runtime"", which treats a similar topic, and you see the difference. or if you prefer a formal style, look at ""Java and the Java Virtual Machine: Definition, Verification, Validation""."
4,Know Thy JVM,"the pace is a little stilted, and the plot is quite worn-out, but I love the wildly surrealistic sections..."
3,not exactly was I was looking,"If you want something like ""make it yourself"" and you are handful and have some knowledge of crafting is ok, but if you wat to use this book as a method for learning about castings without a previous knowledge I wouldn't recommend it for you. My fault."
2,Didn't even last a year,"Worked fine for the first few months of summer, and into the fall. Disconnected hoses and drained it for the winter. It remain mounted, but empty for the winter.When I hooked it up again this spring, it had split open along the seam where the two halves are glued/seamed together and is now totally unusable. (The winter was relatively mild and it was protected from much weather.)Very disappointed that it didn't even last a year. I'll be looking for a metal one, now."
3,Wasn't useful for my purpose,"I bought this for a one time use at my three year old son's water/splash birthday party. I wasn't concerned about longevity, so the inexpensive plastic was fine for me. The product worked, but the problem I had with this device was that I was unable to get enough pressure to work the water toys. I couldn't run two toys with enough pressure...definitely not four. Perhaps a gardener with more experience with connectors would have predicted this. Just thought I'd put it ""out there"" in case anyone else needed the product for this purpose."
2,don't leave the water on,"I used this manifold to replace one that came with a hose sprinkler timer. Naturally the hose bib was turned on, relying on the timer valves to release the water on time. The manifold blew off at the bib where the threads join the manifold, It was in the middle of the night. I had the biggest water bill I have ever seen, the tree liked it though."
4,Sometimes plastic is better,"I have gone through a good number of these type of ""full flow"" manifolds over the years (sometimes under the Craftsman name), mostly because I have waited too long into the colder months to remove them and sometimes did not remove them at all. In the case of the aluminum version I have attempted to leave some on through the whole year, with the same result of leaks developing despite having shut the water pressure off and drained to the extent possible. I decided that the cast metal ones had more problems in the long run - mainly due to substantial corrosion and mineral depositing. In my case the large diameter valves and full flow capability are important so I have stuck with these models despite the fact solid brass may be better. Too bad they don't make a full flow brass version of this."
4,Good Hose Manifold,"I use one of the Gilmour Full Flow Poly 4 way connectors with my RV. Well built and if water volume/flow is important to you, this unit does not restrict the flow like other ball valve type shut-offs. The diameter of the ball valve opening is the same as the outlet."
4,Marco Masini Rocks,"After several CD's done in a tasteful italian pop, Mr. Masini explodes on the scene with a CD that rocks. It has his customary strong lyrics along with a hard edge. This is a must for Marco Masini fans. Highly recommended"
2,Disappointing compared to his other great CD's,I bought this CD and had to return it to the store the same day. Out of all CD's Marco has put out this was the only one I really didn't like. All songs were rock and all sounded the same.
4,"Budget set - great music, cheapo presentation","You really can't argue too much with the price on this set, especially if you pick it up used. Buyers should be aware that in this case, ""box set"" just means a box is involved. There is no extensively-researched and lovingly written booklet, or even the inclusion of discographical details. You just get the dics in cardboard sleeves with artist, song title, and publishing info--nothing more. And the 50 songs on the Rocksteady set would fit onto two discs no problem, but are for reasons of ""box set-ness"" spread out over three discs. Not much of a reason to hang onto the thing, once the tracks are loaded on one's iPod.Now, none of this has anything to do with the quality of the grooves, which is high. Enjoy"
1,Does not contain useful information for investors,"The information in this book is not useful for making money in the stock market. If you are interested in value investing read The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham, The Essays of Warren Buffett, and most anything written by Peter Lynch. If you are interested in more short term oriented strategies you need first to set up a good trading system. I would suggest Trading the Plan by Robert Deel. Unless you understand money management you will lose money. Period."
2,Numerology and Where are the formulas ?,"I think a good book is one that give you all the details to reproduce the results if you wish. Maybe we need to seek for older books when authors didnt have a site to sell software.My first contact with Larry Williams books was with one that he wrote in 1970. In that book things were written more clearly although in the present book several of his theories are largely ignored, as for example, the 37 year cycle he had discovered. (Why ?). The cycle, for example is nonsense.The book says years terminated in 5 are bull years and years in 0 are bear years. Does stock market numerology works?Also I was very frustated with his PROPRIETARY sentiment indexes, and some other formulas, like the management ones that are stated in very confuse terms!"
2,Some good things and some not so good,"Larry includes some historical perspectives on market cycle analysis which is pretty good. He devotes a whole chapter on his Sentiment indicator which can be used to buy & sell stocks. The problem is at the end of the chapter he mentions a company where we can buy charts with his indicator. Larry's Williams R and A/D indicators are in most good software programs but I have never seen a ""sentiment"" indicator from Larry.I really dislike books where you are taught a method only to sell us another service. They are essentially just an advertisement for another service. What a waste."
5,A Practical Guide to Market Timed Investing,"There are many investment guides available but only some are of note. This is one of them. Mr. Williams distills the craft of market timed investing for use by the lay person. Warren Buffet once said ""Anyone came buy a stock that's going ot go up. That's no secret. The secret is knowing when to sell."" From personnal experience I know this to be true. This book is the first practical guide that I have seen that helps with figuring out when to sell without having to use complicated formulas and other difficult methods. And, it also helps with the buying aspect also. If you get one stock investing book this year, let it be this one. I do believe you'll like it."
3,A Good Book on Market Timing,"There are a number of good books on ""Market Timing"" and this would be in the top five. If you could afford to read three books on market timing, I would get Les Masonson's book, Deborah Weir's, and this one. If you want to first learn about market timing one a book at a time, get them in the same order I just listed them.Each book covers some of the same ground but each offers a few nuggets that aren't as well covered in the other two. Larry William's book has the better documentation on the ""Decade Effect"", an interesting correlation between each year in a decade and how the market has done in each of those ten years.So, all in all, buy those three books and you will have a pretty complete understanding of timing the market on a macro-basis."
2,A Little Disappointing,"I love astrology. I love it for its quirks and for it's random shots of right on, heart stopping accuracy. But Love After Sex really disappointed me. Same formula as the dozens of other light, fluffy astrology books I've read. Still, it was entertaining, even if it was very stereotypical."
4,really accurate!,this is a great book. brutal but honest. definitely knows what they are talking about!
2,Not a lot of fun or well made,I purchased this for a Jewish student. The pictures are small and not clear. I did not think it was a good buy and was dissapointed.
1,Must have at least one player who can already read Hebrew letters,"This would be a great game with one tiny change -- the English pronounciations of the letters should be spelled out on the bingo cards and the call sheet. Without that, you need a player or caller who already knows their letters. This is not a game that kids who are just learning their letters can play by themselves. Very frustrating."
4,Half way put together,"Whomever put it together, didn't take it apart very well..so didn't feel challenged. Needs to be apart, but great puzzle."
3,Expensive,"I am a material science student. The book is somewhat easy to read but is not what I'd call vigorous. If you do wish to learn about ceramic processing, shop around first."
2,Tedious,"I used this text for a materials graduate class and found it to be one of the most tedious texts that I have used to date during my undergraduate or graduate education. While apparently comprehensive relative to the subject, the material is not well organized and, at times, has a stream of consciousness flavor to it. It drones on and on with qualitative comments intermingled with quantitative; the graphics are one-dimensional and exclusively black and white. The whole text has a very dated feel, which may be reflective of its 1995 copyright. In general, I found this text to be difficult to read for any length of time. Conversely, I have been exposed to other texts that engage the reader and pique your curiosity to go further. Reed doesn't do that, in fact, I found myself becoming less interested in ceramics than before I began the class!If you are using it for a class, there is not much you can do, but if you have a choice, this isn't the ceramics text to chose."
3,Neo Tantra,"Tantra is a specific system of Yoga which teaches the raising of the kundalini-s'akti through ecstatic experience, self-deification, ritual, and sexual union.Gavin and Yvonne Frost, Elder Initiates in a Welsh Tradition of Witchcraft, and founders of the Church and School of Wica, show information on their own adapted form of Tantric ritual, and make it available to the West.It also contains a section by Gay Astrologer and Witch, Glenn Malec, about adapting the Tantric rituals for same sex partners."
1,This is not Tantra,"A pretty disgusting reading, unlike any other book on Tantra I've seen. This is far from sacred sexuality. The book contains some valuable information but already known from other texts. The authors are very arrogant, attacking almost every other belief system known today -- not the kind of attitude you'd expect from enlightened writers. On top of all, the system they put together is a highly complicated one."
3,"A good text and an important work, but not for everyone","As the words ""Royal Path"" in the title suggest, this book and the system presented in it are not for everyone. It is not the place to look for information on (Neo-)Tantra. The system presented is neither entirely original to the authors nor entirely original Tantric practice and belief.Certainly, much of this information can be found elsewhere. It recieves 3 stars, however, as it is a good collection of information and techniques, and I found their discussion of various beliefs both refreshing and thought-provoking."
2,Be Aware,"I bought this book to use with 5th graders, after we read about the Chicago fire. Be aware that several times in the book characters use the n-word. Once is the black foster brother saying it to the little girl, but later in the book white characters call her the n-word. My principal asked me not to use the book."
4,Sold no more,"This was a great product, great canine nutrition, and a great value. Apparently we bought the last three or four boxes, but Nutro no longer offers this product. I wish they would change their mind and go back into production. Their current products just do not measure up. The only reason it gets only four stars is that it is no longer sold. So disappointing!"
3,In expensiveand it shows,It is on the samll side and was craft (or lack of crafting) shows. Maybe I was expecting too much. It was flimsy. Little info provided.
5,Great product,I was looking for something to play music in the kitchen--ideally something that could replace my existing Tivoli radio and play music from my iPod. This is the perfect player and arrived in terrific condition. It's well designed--both functionally and aesthetically.
1,Sadly this is nothing but junk - worst radio reception of any radio,"I have never owned a radio with worse reception. I am located in Boulder on University Hill, and I can not bring in ONE SINGLE station clearly. Not even close. Not even a clear but mono station even. I called Tivoli, and would be charged $70 to fix it. No warrantee because Sears was not authorized to sell them anymore. Unbelievable. Don't touch the thing..."
4,great name for a little price...,"I just bought this at Sears for $29.97 clearance. Couldn't pass a deal like that up. Been looking for a good radio/ipod system, this is great for the money. Sound is good, clean looks, small profile."
1,Just an expensive regular radio,"Just like everyone before me that has reviewed this item, I have to agree that the device, if you look at it its just a very expensive regular radio. Yes it plays your ipod, but there are other radios in the market for a fraction of the cost that will play your ipod too and do a real good job at it! The sound is just ok, the control does not turn the device off or on and sometimes works stopping lowering and switching track on the ipod, put not always. The only advantage that I see to this radio its portability in an emergency maybe (that I have not tried, cause I haven't had an emergency yet); and even then there are smaller, cheaper radios you can use for that. So unless you just want a radio, an expensive one, you'd be very disappointed with this purchase. Maybe the YiYi is better integrated (reason why I bought this radio was to play it with my ipod, in my room)."
2,Disappointing,"The sound was incredibly thin for a $330 product, and worst of all, it's a poor excuse for a clock radio because the time is not visible during the middle of the night unless you press a button. How many alarm clocks do you know of that require you to press a button to see the time? A fatal oversight by the Tivoli design team."
3,Not worth the price,Sound quality not on par with price. Lacks bass. Certainly not the same sound that made the original Tivoli radio famous.
3,"Sounds great, a little ugly, a few other gripes.","Yes, the sound of this unit is impressive, it's probably the decent speakers and electronics that makes this pricey. My Nano doesn't seem to fix snugly with the docking adapter. Also, I'm a little surprised there's not more comments on the aesthetics, it's a little ugly, but it may grow on me. More presets would have been nice. I like the battery charging feature, but really, for the price, why didn't they include rechargeables?I chose it because it's exactly what I wanted: A portable FM/AM Ipod player, that isn't a bedroom clock or big and bulky, for the kitchen and the deck.All in all, it's a nice sounding unit, works well with the ipod, but I'm not convinced it's worth the price. Then again, maybe I'm just used to Target and Wal-Mart selling cheap electronics from China that ARE crap, but they're still trying to get $100 out of you."
1,"Yuk, Yuk","I bought 2 cases and figured they were cheap and how bad can they taste. oh my god, this energy drink tastes like vick 44 cough medicine. I gave some to my co-workers and none of them could get more than 1 sip down. Spend a little bit more and get redbull."
1,Undrinkable,"I first dropped by a convenience store to try this out before dropping $15 on a case, and I'm glad I did. This tastes like liquified blue bubble gum/cotton candy and is by far the worst tasting of the 20+ energy drinks I have sampled. Don't waste your money on this, Monster or Red Bull or Rockstar are all worth the extra expense because you can drink them without vomitting."
2,Man.......,"I'm not debating whether or not this stuff gives you a jolt of energy, but my god does it taste like ASS. By far the worst tasting energy drink I've ever had! It has a dull smell to it with aromas of bathroom, and the taste is enough to make you cringe.But hey, it only cost me $.60, though it's too bad I bought twelve of them!"
4,Just don't look at it and you'll be fine,"I had no idea that this stuff was blue until I read the reviews above and actually poured some into a glass to see it. If you don't look at it, it tastes fine - and it does what it's supposed to. And now that I know it's blue, I think it will make an excellent mixer for some rather colorful martinis.Last point - at this price - how the heck can you go wrong?I give it a 4 out of 5."
1,Don't order,Didn't receive this item. Took over two weeks for them to let me know. It's a new seller and I can't understand why they advertise products they cannot get for customers.
3,Looks like good music but can't get a safe CD.,"I just got this CD for Christmas, and it looks really wonderful. But be forewarned. It has the Sunncomm software embedded on it. Sony and BMG have trade-in programs for their bad CDs, but it looks like Windham Hill doesn't have a trade-in deal to replace these infected CDs."
2,Not a Patch on the Jeff Buckley CD of the Same Name,"Similarities between Jim Brickman and Jeff Buckley: their initials and the fact that they have each released an album called ""Grace.""The differences: Buckley did it first, and did it better. Buckley is an artist. Brickman wrote commercial jingles before he decided to become a recording ""artist"" -- and for all intents and purposes, he's still writing them. This is basically uninspired background music. If you want to hear a great album called ""Grace,"" go with Jeff Buckley's."
1,"Grace, by Jim Brickman","I actually wanted only one song on this CD, ""Hear Me (Tears Into Wine)"", featuring Michael Bolton. I had to purchase the entire CD and I really do not like any of the other songs on it. I thought I might like ""How Great Thou Art"", but I don't care for this rendition. I wish I had had the option of purchasing only the title song I wanted, but could not find that option available to me. So, I spent more than I should have to get one song on an otherwise very mediocre CD."
5,Love it,"This is a good CD - he has added his style of playing to some of my favorite hymns and Christian songs. If you're a fan of Brickman and looking for something a little different, song wise, this is for you."
1,I can't buy this with good conscience,why in heavens would a religious album be copy-protected? I find the entire idea of copy-protecting a nuisance but for a RELIGIOUS ALBUM? So is this the demographic of folks who are going to copy the CD?Serenity now!
4,Bakelite Jewelry by Wasserman review,"This is a very good book for collectors of bakelite. There are lots of pictures of unusual and creative bakelite jewelry that is so hard to value. The pictures are big and easy to see and most include dates which is so important. I especially like the big collection of crib toy brooches that are not often seen. Most of the pieces are from the 1920's, 30s and 40s. None are from the more modern bakelite designers. Still, it is a rich reference for early bakelite jewelry."
5,Fun memories,"Watched series as a child and loved it. Have watched new remake of the storyline with ""The Rock"" and wanted grandchildren to see the original movie"
3,A gem,"I loved both Escape to Witch Mountain and Return to Witch Mountain as a kid. Now I own both and so should you. This is a great movie for those under 12, its campy, fun and the special effects arent so dated."
1,This deserves a spot on Mystery Science Theater 3000!!!,"That's how cheesy it was!! I like ""Escape from"" but the sequel was VERY bad!"
1,Just awful; waste of time,"Bette Davis is one of my favorite actresses and she almost made this movie worthwhile. She said she wanted to make a movie her grandchildren could watch her in. I hope they did not waste their time with this silly pointless movie. Well it had a point in that it was a sequel. The plot is totally implausible. Much of the movie has a gang of kids skipping school who befriend the star girl played by Kim Richards then they walk every where in Los Angeles. Oh really?Just as in the first movie the special effects were ok, but very dated. In 2009 they appear quite amateurish.I wondered what happened to the kids' suitcases which were in the taxi that left them in a bad part of town."
5,Old Disney Escape From Witch Mountian DVD,Was not sure the Grandkids would like this but they loved it!!! Great buy!
2,Return From Witch Mountian-- If you like cheezy movies,"I own this movie on VHS. Ok I'll admit they made a sequel. (Did I just say that?) If you are a fan of the original ""Escape to Witch Mountain"", this film is a bit of a disappointment.""Return From Witch Mountian"",is slow and much more dark a film than the original. The vilians and sub-plots have more holes then swiss cheese. If you like the characters of Tia and Tony the movie wont disapoint to much. (I think...)If you are picking up this movie for its collectability value then go for it! If you are picking up this movie for you viewing pleasure, put it back on the shelf and make yourself a grilled cheese sandwich. Unless, of course, you like cheezy movies."
3,More of a letdown,"Most of the magic in the first film, Escape to Witch Mountain, was the closeness and interaction of Tony and Tia and the development of their relationship. We're drawn in as we find out more about their powers and are carried along with them on their journey. In this film, Return from Witch Mountain, that audience inclusion is largely lost by the fact that for almost the entire film, the two of them are separated, and Tony hardly has any lines at all. You feel jerked back and forth between two story lines and never get drawn into the action as if you were a part of. Christopher Lee, however, is excellent as the villain, but Bette Davis is terrible. Plus the whole thing is in and around L.A. with real places, buildings, etc. In the first film, part of the mystery was that you did not know exactly where things were taking place. This one misses the mark, but most sequels do. Oh well."
2,no charm the second time around,"The Number One movie of the week is Race To Witch Mountain. But I can't handle the idea of substituting kindly Eddie Albert with The Rock, even if he has made a string of family films. So why not check out the gentle original from 1975, whose special effects seemed so nifty at the time. (Heck, I was even excited by the scene where the kids sat in bed and communicated with each other...telepathically!) You knew the brother was going to be prey to bad influences in the sequel Return From Witch Mountain ($19.99 each; Disney) because he was wearing a horrible turtleneck and in general the very modest magic had gone. But you can never go wrong with a story where kids feel special and misunderstood. I asked my sister the night after seeing the first movie if we should try to speak to each other telepathically when we went to bed and she told me I was a loser. But she cheated by saying it out loud. Fine for the very young. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
2,A Total Stinker,"Truly terrible sequel to ""Escape From Witch Mountain"". The kid actors are hokey, the plot confused, and even the great Bette Davis looks bored and slightly embarrased by the mess that she's in. Its a shame, with this cast and a better premise, this could have really gone somewhere.Not worth the purchase...get it from Netflix. The extras are interesting, but they don't save this clunker."
4,Works pretty good...,Doesn't super duper lighten but is subtle. Hair was a nice color for summer and very shiny. Would recommend!!!
2,The Promise Book 3,There is an interesting plot going on in the background but you have to try to get past all the sexual situations.
4,Excellent Guide for the Pastor and Layperson!,"While Criswells' book is targeted towards pastors, would-be pastors, and other ministry professionals, the book is also useful for the layperson.Among the important points covered include:1. The pastor's manner, appearance, and emotion in preaching.2. Preparing for the sermon during weekly Bible preparation.3. The need for deep Bible knowledge in preaching - rely on the Bible and do not spend so much time in illustrations or stories!4. Relationship between the pastor and church officers.5. Relationships between the pastor and church staff.6. Guidelines for weddings and funerals.7. Financing and organizing the church.8. Pastoral do's and don'ts.While the book is over 20 years old and newer information may be found in other titles, some principles, such as spending ample time alone with Jesus, are timeless!Read the book and be encouraged in the Lord!"
3,"More style than substance, but still worth reading","The cover blurb calls Guedalla's style 'glittering' and 'epigrammatic'; I'd call it tortuous and frustrating. How sad that the definitive biography of the taciturn, straightforward Duke of Wellington is so wordy and vague."
2,Avoid,"I am a Kevin Smith fan. I love most of his work and by that I mean I wasn't big on the sequel to ""An Evening With Kevin Smith"" and I wasn't big on ""Chasing Amy"" or the animated series of Clerks. The rest of his movies I liked a lot or loved. Never read his comics though.I was expecting a lot from this book. And I didn't get it. This book takes place basically telling the story kind of like production journals of him working on ""Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back"". But while he is doing that he goes off on stories about other topics. Don't get me wrong, I typically enjoy that stuff from him a lot. But this book hasn't made me laugh once and I am a tad over 100 pages into it."
4,Great Treasure of Connecticut Bedroom Pop,"Jim Rao is a gifted singer / songwriter from Connecticut. His past albums have been quite good although there's a certain level or thread of consistency here which elevates my interest and fondness for his work. This is his best, most consistent output to date. If you like raw, unpolished, catchy, dreamily melodic pop songs then you don't want to miss this."
3,WHAT ?,"I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE HELL HAPPEND? THIS BOOK LEFT YOU HANGING ON THE STATUS OF CARMEN/PAMMY SHE STARTED TALKING TO HER SELF AND WE WAS NEVER TOLD WHAT REALLY WENT DOWN. IS THIS BOOK SUPPOSE TO BE BASED LOOSELY ON MS. STRINGER HER SELF, RIGHT. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPEN TO HER, BUT THIS IS A BOOK WHY DID VS NOT TELL US (THE READERS) WHAT HAPPEN TO PAM/CARMEN?"
4,GOOD GOOD 4.5 READ!,"VICKIE STRINGER FINDS A WAY OF TAKING YOUR IMAGINATION AND PLACING YOU VIVIDLY IN HER SCENES. YOU CAN FEEL HER EMOTION. YOU CAN VISUALIZE HER CHARACTERS EXPRESSIONS. THE GUN SHOTS RING OUT AND THEY'LL HAVE YOU DUCKING ALONG WITH HER CHARACTERS. VICKIE STRINGER: KEEP DOING WHAT YOU DO, THE WAY YOU DO WHAT YOU DO. I LOVE IT. CAL"
2,THIS BOOK WASNT GOOD AT ALL,I WAS SO SUSPRISED ABOUT THIS BOOK IT WAS SO SLOW I COULDNT BELIEVE IT. I GAVE THIS BOOK TO A FRIEND TO READ AND SAID THE SAMETHING. THIS WASNT THE BOOK OF THE YEAR. SORRY
4,"IT WAS COOL, BUT...","I TOO, LIKE OTHERS, WAITED FOR THIS BOOK. I MUST SAY, IT WAS GOOD, BUT I WANTED A LITTLE BIT MORE. HOPEFULLY, I'LL GET IT IN THE NEXT BOOK, BUT FOR NOW, MY MOUTH IS A LITTLE DRY. I STILL LIKE THIS AUTHORS WORK AND I WILL PURCHASE ANYTHING THAT SHE WRITES."
3,Imagine This Book Was Good,"I don't what that was I just read, but Let That Be The Reason was way better. I understand Ms. Stringer had to let us know what happened to Pamela in jail and whether she was going to be a snitch or not, but the way she crafted the story, it was dead wrong to leave us hanging at the end, THAT'S RIGHT I TOLD IT!!!! I was so disappointed by that book. I was so excited to read it because the cover was off da hook, but like they say, never judge a book by its cover.Later!!!"
1,I never imagined....,"I hate to say it but, this book was booooring! I should have saved my money! I did not like Vickie's other book all that much either! I could not get into this book. I recommend ""The Glamorous Life"" instead of this mess! I will not be buying any more of Ms. Stringers books. Sorry!"
2,Dont even wanna read the first,After reading the second book i dont even wanna read he firstbecause this was so boring!!!
2,Dont waste your time reading the whole book,The first one was a better read. This book was boring and I felt like there was no ending to it.
2,Never imagined this,Let That Be The Reason was a much better and had me anticipating the sequel. Things happened to slow in the book and I found myself scanning the pages in order to get through it. HOpefully the next book will be much better. The author does have skill so I will continue to read her books. Although I might try to borrow the next one instead of buying it!!
3,Imagine I'm Mad at You Ms. Stringer,"I wanted to know what happened! Did Carmen/Pammy ride or die - in jail or out? I loved your book VS and I loved The Hood by Ebony Stroman (I read them back to back) but I didn't like the way either one of you ended your books. I want more, I need more. Imagine my dissapointment when I read a book just to find out what's gonna happen at the end only to find out that the end doesn't really exsit! I had to Imagine what happened with both books on my own. When I read I don't wanna use my imagination more than I have to. This is why I pay you to stimulate my imagination. Other than the end both books were great! In additon to Imagine This by Vicki Stringer I'd also recommend The Hood by Ebony Stroman, Sheisty by T.N. Baker, Flower's Bed by Antoine Thomas, Dime Piece by Tracy Brown (Black was good too), Let that be the reason by Vicki Stringer as well and The Adventures of Ghetto Sam by Kwamane Teauge."
2,A WAIST OF TIME,"I WAS TRULY UPSET ONCE I FINISHED THIS BOOK!!! I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT READING IT, BUT ONCE I FINISHED I WAS HIGHLY PISSED!!!! I CANT BELIEVE IT ENDED AS A CLIFF HANGER!!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY BECAUSE I SURE WASTED MINE!!!MAYBE NEXT TIME VICKEY WILL MAKE A BETTER BOOK,HOWEVER IM NOT SURE ILL READ IT!!!!"
1,HATED IT,"The sequel definitely did not live up to ""Let That Be The Reason""...a MAJOR disappointment and MAJOR let down. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,"WASTE OF MONEY, TIME, AND EVERYTHING ELSE RELATED!","OMG...this book was the most boring book i've ever read. Dang! Let That Be The Reason was alright, but this book was just whack. I'm not even gonna finish it cuz all the other reviews agree. And i doubt i'll buy another one of her books, cuz like i said, Let That Be The Reason was alright, and this book was corny. Sorry Vickie, i'm good with your books!"
1,Should have waited,"This book was a major disappointment, especially after LET THAT BE THE REASON. I think the author should have waited a little longer for the sequel. Probably until after she developed a better story."
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"I WAS VERY UPSET IN THIS BOOK!! LET THAT BE THE REASON WAS EXCELLENT, WHAT HAPPENED? I THOUGHT THE SEQUEL WOULD OF BEEN BETTER OR A LEAST THE SAME. I HOPE HER NEXT NOVEL IS WORTH MY TIME CAUSE THIS ONE WASN'T!!"
4,Very good book!,"Keep the books rolling in, cause you had me tied down with Let that be the reason, and now Imagine this. Chico, Pam, Carmen, and the rest of the crew. Then how Ty just took Chico out was mad crazy. If you haven't read this or any of Mrs. Stringer books you just don't know what your missing. So let's get with the PROGRAM!"
4,Really enjoyed!,I love the book not as good as Let That Be the Reason . Must read!! Waiting for Book 3.
2,BOORING!!,"The book was boring. I had to fight to finish it. However, Stringer is a good author and I would still buy another one of her books."
2,Don't Imagine This,"I waited patiently for the sequel to Let that be the Reason, the book was slow but once I got into it was just okay. I hated the ending was she psycho or what, I know she was facing some serious time but the whole conversation with her alter ego as visitor was unrealistic."
1,What is everyone smoking???!!!!,"This book is terrible. She's in jail the whole time, and its basically like a lunitics diary. Its boring. It leaves you feeling like you wasted your money on a book that has no solid ending. She should have left the book off on LET THAT BE THE REASON."
4,Vicki Springer's now a more experienced writer,"I agree with the last reviewer. This book was much better than Let that be the reason. The two books don't really link together.The choices she had to choose from be loyal to the street code or be with her child. In my opinion, the street code was not loyal to her. She doesn't owe the streets anything. She owes her son everything. She should try to get in the witness protection program or something to prevent her and her son from being hurt.But when it comes to your children, you should never have to choose something over them. No matter what, they should always come first."
4,I felt incarcirated,"I really loved this book. I read it in one day. The details were so vivid I could see the county jail and the courtroom. I felt Pam's pain and confusion. I thought it was very mature of Vicky Stringer to not tell her decision. This book was a real account of her private life and I felt that she was so brave to let us in as much as she did. Her decision is her decision. I'm sure that wheather she decided to go with Pammy or Carmen, she has obviously come out on top. She has her own publishing company and still has her son in her life. Hey, All things work together for good, for those who love God.May God bless you Ms. Stringer"
5,Can't beat Baxter Black,Anyone who has seen Baxter Black in person or read his poetry knows he is funny as well as insightful. If you have spent time around animals his words will ring true. He is a gem of a writer!
3,Tara Belle,"Not near as good as the first book. THe first book had me laughing out loud, this one is just stupid. Sorry Baxter, love your other works."
2,Banged out,We love music and were thrilled when we received this as a gift. However it did not last 2 days. The top of the drum broke when my three year old hit ir instead of taping on it. Very disapointed.
4,"Finally, an epidemic we can prevent !","Dr. Caroline Ashworth tries to be kind to parents about this childhood obesity epidemic, but the truth is that we set the standard for our kids, no matter that we don`t like it sometimes. Parents who sit around stuffing their faces with the wrong kind of food have a profound effect on their children. At least the author gives people plenty of ideas about how to turn this around and save these kids from life-long health problems."
5,Tasty,"Excellent album. Think of it as a refined version of Musique, so if you liked Musique then you'll definitely want to pick this up. If not, you'll probably hate it."
5,simply great music,"Theatre of Tragedy combine different styles and they do that well. Brilliant guitars, cool electronics and most important: Liv Christines phenomenal voice.This album shows how a band can develop just right."
5,better than it has any right to be,"I want to start out by saying the song titles on the Nuclear Blast CD that I own are completely different than what's listed above. As for the music, it is absolutely first-rate techno-pop. Normally, I would hate stuff like this, as I heard too much third-rate ... of this kind back in the '80s, but this is just so well-done it grabs hold like a fishhook in your brain and won't let go. Their previous album, Musique, is in the same vein, and almost as good. Before that, they put out some excellent goth metal albums, and Liv Kristine's solo album is far superior to almost anything put out by any American pop princess diva. Give 'em a try."
3,OK text,"This text is rather dry and lacks illustrations. It was required for my experimental psyche class, but I would have preferred a different text book. The product I received, however, arrived as described."
2,so-so,"Had a hard time understanding what they were trying to explain. Poor examples were given. As soon as I opened to a page I had to read, I noticed many typos on the same page!"
3,Wooden Fence Review,"I am kind of okay with the fence. It was just a little bit disappointing in that the value for the cost seems out of sync. I feel sure that comparatively, it meets industry standards; I guess I was expecting a little more for the money."
2,Slim,These envelopes are not as big inside as they say they are. I had to run my hands I side the sides to loosen them enough to fit.
4,I'll keep it short and to the point.,"Pros- Works like any other envelope- Come in one big, easy to open boxCons- Slightly lower quality than Eco-Light- Higher cost buying 50 at a time than 100 at a timeWill buy Eco-Light from now on."
5,Excellent bubble mailers,Perfect for shipping lightweight items. Got these for around $17 which seems like a fair price. These mailers have great bubble protection to secure any loose items in transit.
5,Perfect protection and ease of use,Envelope is a great price and protects anything I mail. I love the easy use. Anyone can use this and mail anything!
4,Better than most padded shipping envelopes,The bubbling in these envelopes is sturdier than most out there. They're also turned smooth side out so that things slide in and out more easily. The only problem I have with these is that the adhesive seal isn't as strong as most.
5,"fast shipment, great quality",AWESOME! My order was received very fast and the quality of the product is outstanding. I will order again once I finally use all these envelopes.
5,Great envelopes,"These are great envelopes for the price - not only are they inexpensive, but they are lightweight and durable, too. At this point, I have discontinued the use of three other envelope sizes and brands in the favor of these."
5,Great product!,Great product at a great price. Was using a cheap Chinese manufactured product that was very inferior. These are the best for the money. Very fast ship.
1,Wrong Mailers!,"I ordered Kraft Bubble Wrap Padded Mailers #5 as pictured above. Instead I received a flimsy, silver-grey, semi-padded envelope that was not nearly as good as what is picrued. I contacted the company to no avail, and never heard back from them. I will not order from California Office Supply again."
4,Philly Stakes,"Even if the mystery itself were not so well-crafted, Roberts' prose would have kept me hooked throughout this book. Add to that her obvious understanding of, and compassion for, the teenage condition, and the book is a clear winner. I'd have given it five stars, but for the fact that I guessed who the villain was half-way through the book (though not the true identity or family connection), and I hate it when that happens."
5,Sasha Provides A Welcome Contrast,Detective MacKenzie is still in Amanda's life but more in the background in this episode. Amanda's wacky friend Sasha Berg provides a welcome contrast to the stolid policeman. PHILLY STAKES is one of the stronger entries in the very entertaining Amanda Pepper series.
1,The price gouging has begun!,"Sunday - April 26th, 2009* Important MessagePlease note that the price of PYRAMEX DM-3 N95 SAFETY RESPIRATOR SURGICAL MASK 10/BX has increased from $9.99 to $30.99 since you placed it in your Shopping Cart. Items in your cart will always reflect the most recent price displayed on their product detail pages.PYRAMEX DM-3 N95 SAFETY RESPIRATOR SURGICAL MASK 10/BX"
3,Prestel's version of Carmina revisited,"In my earlier review (12-23-03) I spoke favorably about the conductor's preference for slower, more deliberate tempos. But after listening again, I find that this tendency can sometimes be a disadvantage. For example, the threefold repetition of a simple orchestral theme in the ""Reie"" interlude is drawn out much too long. I regret, as well, that the sound of the massive chorus in the final ""O Fortuna"" has been pushed to the background so as to give prominence to the percussion effects in the foreground. For these reasons, I would change the rating from four stars to three."
4,I would've given this a Five Star Rating if...,"it were still priced at the $16.95--the original cover price. I was going to use this for my Roman Civ. class but noticed that Oxford jacked the price up to $36.00. It's great because it provides a survey or Roman literature from the perspective of its historical readers informed by more recent approaches to lit (i.e. not New Criticism--we are classicists afterall, so it takes us a while to warm up to things). The chapters are written by first rate scholars and are informative esp for undergrads."
2,A series it's not.,"What was made into a series, could have been done in a single one segment of 45 minutes. I found it very redundant and over dramatized. I found the first series done in India somewhat more interesting."
2,NOT what I was hoping for...,"I am highly disappointed in the outcome of this package. It not only DOESN'T fill my entire TV screen, but also it has fewer episodes than what they showed us on History Channel in 2009!I was expecting to see 16 episodes available in package, and failed to see the product details further down its page on Amazon. That was MY fault, obviously, but what really angers me the most is how small the picture is when played from my new optical drive. Season 4 does NOT have this problem, and there are all 16 episodes in that package. However, I've played that season so many times I thought it was then time to watch a different season. And since Season 3 was my original favorite of the ""Ice Road Truckers"" series, I chose to go with that. Amazon needs to improve the quality of their DVDs based on TV episodes, in my opinion!"
4,Short story version,"This appears to be the novelette (or long short story) version, which Brown expanded into the novel of the same title. While an excellent story, the novel is better because of the fuller characterization, which contributes to the stunning ending.You should probably read the novel first, then read this to get some insight into how a really fine writer works."
4,Short noir tale,"This isn't a full length book. Not sure how many pages it would be in a real book, but I read most of it during a 30 minute car ride.Decent noir mystery. Fredric Brown knew how to write em."
5,The best of Jim Nabors,"I bought this CD to replace my casettes that are wearing out. This tells you I already liked the music this gifted artist produces. Jim's voice is dynamic and powerful. He does get lazy and sings ballads that don't tax his voice but when he does let loose, stand by for a really great experience. The Impossible dream, Cuando Calienta el Sol, and Sunrise Sunset are examples of Jim's great voice at it's finest. If you are even thinking about getting this CD, quit thinking and do it. You'll be glad you had the chance to hear it."
4,The Computer Companion is Aging Well...,"To be honest, I really didn't WANT to write a good review of this book. In my experience a book that does anything to overview the WWW does itself and its readers a disservice since reality will make it quickly out of date.Surprisingly, the ""Astronomer's Computer Companion,"" written in late 1999, is actually aging well. A good majority of the web sites it references still do exist and are helpful. Jeff & Ron's writing style is easy to understand and also easy on the mind without crossing the line into outright fluff.This book is most useful for the armchair astronomer who has good access to a computer and the internet and who doesn't want to waste a lot of time aimlessly going through search engines. Jeff & Ron have done the work for you and again, surprisingly, the work still stands up well even in the face of a very quickly changing field.They did a very credible job with a rather difficult environment to work with."
2,AlinSA,"The concept was great when the book was first published, but as of Jan. 2012, a lot of the websites listed are sadly out of date or no longer available. If this were 2000, I would say this was a must have addition to any astronomer's library. Unless the authors update the book and come out with a new version, don't waste your money."
2,I wanted to like this book,I wanted to like this book but in the end I have to wonder what the purpose of buying a book whose contents can be found in 10 minutes searching the internet. This book was perhaps of some value 5 years ago. I expected that this book would be more than a description of websites and programs and contain some 'how-to' information. Pages 293 through 482 were used to describe what was on the cd.There are better astronomy books out there and the software and website descriptions properly belong on the internet.
2,Barely Serviceable,"It's hard to understand people unless they speak loudly, especially if they are calling from a cell phone. If they pause too long, it will cut them off. I am looking for a machine that uses tapes like my old one."
5,A rare terrific movie !,"Absolutly amazing this movie ! It's one of the best movies I've ever seen !Hugo Weaving is great, starring the character of Martin, a blind loner cold man full of bitterness who trusts anyone more probably because of his strange relationship with his mother.Really talented this man !Geneviève Picot is also very good at the character of Celia, Martin's housekeeper. She's a strange perverse woman who is secretly in love with Martin completly obsessed by him.Russel Crowe 's starring Andy who becomes the only person Martin trusts in.The actors, the script all are great. I recommand this movie.Thanks for this really rare entertainement.I ask some kind of movie more and more..."
4,Crowe's destiny for fine acting evident early in his career.,"Crowe's attention even to the smallest details make his character very convincing with such an unusal storyline. Hugo Weaving did an excellent job with his role as a blind man. The music by NOT DROWNING, WAVING fits it very well. This film makes you laugh, tears at your heart, and makes you mad, too.I watch it often and enjoy it every time I do."
3,oh those glorious harmonies,"The CD is just under 25 minutes long. The songs are: (1) It Feels Like Christmas (2) O' Holy Night (3) It Came Upon A Midnight Clear (4) What Child Is This (5) O' Little Town of Bethlehem (6) The Twelve Days of Christmas (7) O' Christmas Tree (8) Silent Night. The audio quality is a bit muddy, but not terrible. That is to say, the music doesn't hurt my ears.I bought this cd because I remembered the wonderful harmonies of songs like ""When I Fall In Love"" and ""Love is a Many Splendored Thing"". I would have liked more of this type of harmony and sung with a bit more emotion, but several songs satisfied quite nicely. 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' was perhaps worth the price of the CD. 'Silent Night' was a close second."
4,Useful aid,"It is a very useful aid to find your way around, look for a restaurant or use the cell phone in the car. The device mounts easily on the windshield and is small enough not to destruct the view. The directions are clear and entering an address or a special place are fairly straight forward. However this device still needs a lot of improvement to be a main stream driving aid tool. The names of the streets are not very clearly pronounced and there is too much relience on on-screen instructions or touch screen operations. For example, using the bluetooth feature which is supposed to give you ""hands free"" operation, you need to touch the screen to answer a call or to end it. I can see how it may lead to accidents instead of preventing them. It is excellent when someone is sitting by the driver paying attention to messages, and the information provided. But when a driver is alone in the car it is a major distruction to driving. By comarison, a cell phone is just a minor one."
5,Garmin Street Pilot C550,"I purchased my Garmin to replace a Magellan Road Mate 800 ($1,000.00) The Garmin is incredible. The Bluetooth is great and the unit is so easy to use. At just over half the price of the Magellan, it is a super value."
3,"Good product, still figuring it out","So far, we really like using this gps, but we haven't yet figured out how to get it to calculte alternate routes. For example, if there's an accident on the freeway and we'd like to go surface streets instead, when we get off the freeway and press ""detour"", the unit simply wants us to get back on the original route. I'm sure it's in the manual, and we are the types to not read the manual :) Other than that, it has provided us with everything we wanted and I would recommend it."
4,Buy a SmartPhone instead.,"Had this less than a year and it is very helpful when you go place's you've never been to before. You can search for places to eat and see in an area your not familiar with. It seems to always get me to where I want to go. I like the built in speaker and antenna.Only thing I don't like is that mine already needs updating after less than a year. When on a newer road My little truck icon is out in no mans land, and the unit keeps trying to get me back on a known road. The maps are updatable (not free) and not sure what ""Extras"" are but they can also be downloaded.Mine is set on ""fastest route"" and I know from testing on my home roads that it does not always know the fastet route. This makes me question it when I'm out of town.I'll use my Android smart phone from now on. Smartphones have nearly made car GPS unit's obsolete. Only thing is the GPS units work when the cell phones don't have a signal."
2,Not good not bad,I have been using another brand in UK and now tried this in US.I am happy with the service from Amazon and not happy with the product. This doesn't have latest maps and trying to take me into busy areas. There was easy Freeway but it took me in different root.I am returning this device.
5,"Died after two months. (Update, replacement is going strong)","This worked great for two months then died completely. Now dealing with the fun of warranty service. Based on other peoples reviews and experiences with Garmin warranty service, I don't have much hope for this device, even if it gets repaired or replaced.Update - I already commenting on my own review before realizing I could edit it. I love my little old GPS and it's still going strong after the initial warranty replacement."
5,"Accurate, durable, dependable GPS","Have the c550 for about two months. First I bought the c530 but then decided I wanted the traffic and text-to-speech. Glad I got the 550, but the major and best features of both are the same -- very accurate, excellent signal retention (I often use it to plan routes INSIDE my condo), high quality, great display, solid construction. It's been through bumps, heat, cold and still works like the day it was new. Highly recommended."
2,Received non-working instrument,"I have been looking to own this GPS for a while, finally I received the product in main on time. I was so excited to use. When I switched on the unit, it dispalyed ""acquiring sattellite link please wait....."", I have waited for very near an hour or so but the link didn't come. Hoping that it will work next day. But the instrument died when I switched on next day. Even when I plug in the instrument, it was not being charged. Finally I have to return the product. But return was good though........I got my money back on time."
4,"Love it, except for keyboard layout","This is a great product, does what was advertised. I wish the touch screen keyboard layout was QWERTY rather than alphabetical."
5,"Easy to use, Great display lots of options.",This is a great GSP system. I have see several of my friends use theirs and you need to have a great memory of where all the features are located. This model is easy to use that you don't even need to read a manual. I taught my father-in-law how to use it in 5 minutes but still has issues with his cell phone after 2 months. I was recommended to buy this from a sales man that trales all over the world and says he uses it everywhere. Great GPS all around!!!!
3,Good for GPS Only,"If you are buying this and paying extra for the MP3 and Bluetooth options, DON'T. The GPS is fine. Like all GPS systems, it has it's limitations, but overall it works as it should. The MP3 player and the Bluetooth options are, in my opinion, terrible. The sound is very ""canny."" It looks as if Garmin could have installed some higher quality speakers in this unit. The bluetooth option requires too much interaction with the screen, making it dangerous to operate while moving. Do yourself a favor and get the C340 model if you are looking for a good GPS device and get yourself some other options for Bluetooth and MP3 player. The only advantage the C550 has over the C340 is the anti-glare screen, but you can purchase an anti-glare film to solve this problem, and believe me, the glare on the C340 is a problem. This is another place that Garmin has room for improvement."
3,try before you buy,"My father has one of these, and I rented one for a week through Avis on my last trip.It got things wrong a few too many times for me to love it. I can't tell you how many times it said ""recalculating"" as we were driving around lost in the Berkeley hills, so near and yet so far from our destination. I wanted to fling it out the window.To its credit, it was polite in our time of distress. You can change its voice, from Australian to American to British. And things always sound more dignified when coming from an English butler. His ""recalculating"" seemed to be gently chiding us for failing to heed his advice. ""Really, sir, how long do you intend to persist with this folly?"" ""Well, Jeeves, as long as your directions STINK!""Search features for things like restaurants are limiting. Shouldn't there be a category or Starbucks or fast food?Hertz uses different technology (Navtech plus Magellan maybe?) which I remember working better.Try before you buy."
2,Not a fan,I bought this a year ago because of all the excellent reviews on Amazon. The unit itself works fine and does a lot of good things but there is one thing it does not do well: plot routes. I don't know what it is about this unit but it seems to take the strangest routes. In the city it will take me through all kinds of small side streets when there is a major street right next to it that goes directly to my destination. And then to make it even more weird it does not always take the same route. I can start from the same location and going to the same destination and this unit will take me on two different routes.So maybe the newer Garmins are decent but I definitely cannot recommend this one.
5,Liked the first one and bought a second,I bought one c550 and liked how easy it was to operate so I bought a second one for our other car.This GPS has everthing I wanted. The blutooth was a breeze and works very well.I would highly recommend this unit to anyone looking for a great GPS.
2,Not as described....,"I was happy to see this item on the website. However, the item I received was not new in Garmin packaging. I thought I was ordering from a site that would have described the item as being either an open box item or would have clearly indicated that it was not in a sealed Garmin Box. It didn't mention that it was not in the original packaging. The item was loose in a reasonably sized, white gift type box.This raises questions about this present which I purchased for my husband as a gift. I rely on Amazon for purchasing items and I have always gotten exactly what I expected. This was a disappointment and since I went through Amazon I would have expected a better description by those that use the Amazon site to list their items."
3,Garmin Street Pilot C550,I have found that the Garmin SteetPilot always directs me to the major thoroughfares and will not acknowledge the shortest routes.
2,garmin gps c550,"the directions are sometimes too late, making it dangerous, and the traffic reports are always wrong.I would like to return the product, if it is possible."
5,Fulfills all expectations,"The Streetpilot c550 was perfect right out of the box. It's intuitive to operate and the Bluetooth works fine. One phone transferred the address book flawlessly and updates it automatically, but the other phone needed to have addresses transferred one by one -- but that was because of the phone, not the Garmin. I used the Garmin to get home from a familiar destination and was skeptical when it directed me onto an unfamiliar road ... only to realize that the Garmin had a shorter, easier route in mind, and one I had not tried before."
5,"Love, Love, Love This!","I purchased the Garmin StreetPilot c550 after doing extensive research on portable GPS products. I am so pleased with this purchase & I can't recommend it highly enough. The screen is easy to see even in bright sunlight and it is unbelievably user-friendly. The directions are accurate and the unit recalculates in an instant if you miss a turn (no more hearing 'please make a legal U-Turn', which is a relief). The Blue Tooth feature is fantastic and it was a snap to sync my cell phone (Motorola Rzr) to the unit. I also like the clear channel traffic feature, but perhaps that's because we have great clear channel coverage in my area. I would say that this is the perfect unit for someone looking for a portable GPS that is easy to use with lots and bells and whistles at a fair price. In fact, I just bought a second unit for my dad. This is a great, great, great product!!"
5,Very Nice Unit,"The only con I find with this unit is that sometimes it tells you the address is on the left when it's actually on the right. Garmin also needs to update. The c550 still shows roads that have been completely closed & gone for at least 12 or 15 years & doesn't show newer roads that have been here for at least 6 or 7 years. Other than that, very nice unit."
1,Garmin Streetpilot refurbished,"The Garmin Streetpilot c550 refurbished that I received from the factory was as described and has great functions. Unfortunately, the unit was not working properly (would not connect through car adapter). I ordered another car adaptor thinking it was just the adaptor (paid an additional $24.00) and found it was the unit instead. So, the unit needed to be returned. I would expect that something that comes from the factory as refurbished would have been inspected. Now I am without the unit for a few weeks and incurred additional expenses."
1,Diffrent than i thought,They mention they send me new products but its refurbish and i dont like this. Si i dont think so i will take risk to buy from amazon nect time.
1,Messed up product,"Ok,I ordered through Amazon and it took few days for me to get it. I got it and used it exactly for three days and lines started showing up through the screen. I had to ask Amazon to send me shipping label so I can ship it back to them, wait for the refund to post to my account and then order a new one. I ordered a new one and it arrived home while I was at work. I got back from work, went down to the car and pluged it in, drove about six miles and then it completely died!Nothing, no screen, no power nothing.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!"
3,"Garmin 550 Street Pilot, now discontinued","I loved this GPS as it has ""Truck Routes"" in it for us RV enthusiasts but it has now been discontinued by Garmin so I cannot get their lifetime Update program which disappoints me. I still use this most days but I don't want to spend $70.00 to update it for one year now so we will probably buy a replacement in a few years with the lifetime update program. Otherwise it has been a wonderful piece of equipment and I would recommend Garmin and Amazon for the free shipping and no sales tax!"
2,Mistake,"This product was excellent for about three months until the sound went out. Prior to the sound going out, the major complaint was the sound quality. When travelling on the freeway you could hardly hear the navigation sound. When WA state set laws on cell phone use, we used this as our hands free device. To our disappointment, it only lasted three months before losing all sound.Second complaint, it sends us driving in circles at times because the satellite can't catch up to the direction of the car soon enough.There has got to be better out there. Back when we bought it 1.5 years ago, this was the best one rated by consumer reports. Do your research ahead. Instead of research, talk to people that actually own the model you want to purchase."
5,Great Gadget,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he loved it! The unit is user friendly, yet has tremendous capability. We highly recommend it."
5,unbelievable,this is one of the best investments I've made in a while. I can't believe how easy it was to set up and use. I am extremely satisfied with all the features. I will definitely buy more for my family.
1,Open Stock Sold As New,"Amazons merchant Electronica Direct shipped a Garmin c550 that was open stock and not new. The box had been opened, the GPS unit had been removed from its packaging and the cardboard frame that held the GPS unit in the box had been crushed. The GPS unit was loose in the box. When cutomers buy products from Amazon as new, they shouldn't be sent open stock items as new. Because of the delays in receiving a new product, I was unable to give my wife her Mothers Day gift. I won't only purchase books from Amazon in the future."
2,"GARMIN YES, Amazon ?","Purchased a Garmin c550 as gift we are giving today. Am sure it will be a good buy. However in the add for this garmin it listed below ""better together"" and showed a cigarette lighter cable to the garmin. I assumed this was the power cable and thought of course you need it. However the power cable came with the garmin and I have this extra cable for what reason I do not know. Amazon told me I bought the cable from another company and should return it to them. This involved shipping charges plus a restocking fee. Hardly worth while. After three E Mails I never did get an explanation of why the purchase was better with the extra cable. However when checking my Garmin from Amazon I was surprised to find this cable was supplied with mine. Needless to say I was't impressed with Amazon."
1,Garmin StreetPilot c550 Vehicle GPS Navigator A PIECE OF GARBAGE.,Garmin StreetPilot c550 Vehicle GPS NavigatorThis product is literally useless or the piece I received is defective. It takes long time - 10 to 15 minutes to find a satellite in open air and facing sky. It gives directions taking small roads instead of highways and state routes even when HIGHWAY box is selected. Ultimately it misleads. A PIECE OF GARBAGE CONSIDERING PRICE I PAID.I WANT TO RETURN IT AND GET FULL REFUND FOR IT.
1,Received a Used Garmin Navigation System,This product was a return from another customer. The packaging was torn and in disarray. I think Amazon should have a better quality control system and should inspect all returns. They did however allow me to return the item at their expense and sent me a new one which was in mint condition.
1,Open Box,"I can't believe that pay for a product in open box, i don't know who is the responsability, my concern is the somebody opened and it should be more serious in this matter."
5,As Good As It Gets !,"Garmin Streetpilot c550 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorThis product works as good as you need any GPS to work. It is easy to set up and has an excellent mapping system installed and the on screen prompts let you do anything you would need to do with it.This Garmin's bluetooth linked right up with my Motorola Razr and installed my entire phonebook for automatic dialing.It is very intuitive if you make a change to the route and instantly recalculates the rest of the way to your destination from the detour.I know this product is discontinued, but I would look for the replacement model from Garmin, if a 550c is no longer available.It is so easy to use without installing the window mount with the optional beanbag mount which is very stable in all driving conditions."
4,Good but not perfect,I bought this to help reaquaint myself with the Denver area after being gone for 20 some years as I was now moving back to town. While it has been helpful say 80% of the time. The directions are off two frequently. Like the final mile to my house. I've been here two months now and don't use it all that often but I find it especially useful when I'm away from home and want to find the best way from that spot to one on my favorite list. I'm hoping the next upgrade to the software will start ironing out some ot the kinks in direction giving.That said I'd still buy it again.
3,Poor suction on auto glass. The GPS falls off couple of times. Not a well thought out product,Poor suction on auto glass. The GPS falls off couple of times. Not a well thought out product.
4,great product,"IM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE, IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT, TRAFFIC CONTROLLER WORKS GREAT, AND THE ADDRESSES ARE PRETTY ACCURATE. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS WHEN ITS TIME TO TURN ON THE INTERSTATE IT DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT LANE TO GET IN TILL YOU ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE TURN, LIKE HAVING TO MAKE A LEFT OR RIGHT EXIT. BUT OVERALL I AM HAPPY EXSPECIALLY WITH THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT."
4,Garmin C550 Streetpilot GPS,This product is everything we expected except for the dash mount. I would have liked to know that the vaccuum dash mount required a permanent adhesive disk be affixed to the dash which made it not transportable to another vehicle. We want to easily switch between cars or even take the Garmin C550 with us to use in a rental car when we fly somewhere. It has taken some experimentation to see what the best dash placement for the GPS is. A permanent adhesive disk would have prohibited changing our mind. We went to Fry's Electronics to buy another type of dash mount -- friction mount. It works very well -- the Garmin does not move around on the dash even with sharp turns and we can just pick it up and take it with us to another vehicle.
1,Great when it works which isn't often.,"Easy to use, accurate navigational device ... when it works. I bought the first unit and powered it up but got nothing. Tech support suggested I exchange it for a new one. The second one worked quite well and was a pleasure to use ... for three weeks. Then it went dead and no amount of charging or resets made a difference. Returned it and got a replacement that also went dead after three weeks. I'm waiting for the fourth unit to arrive but don't have high hopes of having it work.I paid almost $800 for this unit but think it was a waste of money. It's a great product but it is too unreliable."
5,I like the Garmin StreetPilot c550,"This GPS has great features:- A dependable GPS - Voice and visual prompts, not just lots of beeping like some. It quickly calculates (and recalculates) if you don't follow a route. It's quick to learn and very easy to use. The updates are easy to download. I chose the English accent, but you can go with many different dialects and/or languages.- I was attracted to this unit because it also offers hands-free (bluetooth) phone calling. The microphone and speaker are crystal clear and the unit does not use any voice prompts while you are in a phone call. I love this feature because I hate the bluetooth earpieces and found other hands-free devices to provide less than clear transmission.- the unit also offers a card slot for MP3 music playing, but I haven't used this feature.Overall, I would buy again and highly recommend."
5,Couldn't be happier,"I love this thing. I moved to LA for a summer internship, and didn't want to get butt-lost while I was driving around town there. So I picked this one because of its ability to speak street names, and its Bluetooth connection (because as of July 1st, you HAVE to use some sort of hands-free device in the car).This thing works great. It does a good job of getting me there in the fastest time, avoiding freeways during rush hour, etc. The spoken street names is a MUST, that way you don't even have to look at it while driving. My friend has the Nuvi 200 which doesn't say the street names, and it's a bit tougher to navigate with it.Also, it has a trip clock with avg speed, moving time, stopped time, total miles, and top speed (which is evil).It's a great little GPS, and I wouldn't hesitate to get it again if I had the chance."
5,Super,"Trips seem shorter! Driving is fun again. Works well right out of the box. When it suggests the fastest route, it wants to take you ""out of the way"" at times. However, when you proceed an alternate route that you know best, it recalculates quickly. It also seems to ""learn"" the preferred route and will use it on a return trip. This is the best purchase I have made in a long time! The Bluetooth capability makes this a slam dunk!"
4,Very Capable GPS,"I purchased this GPS as a gift for family. The only complaint I received was that the power ran down quickly during use, but I called the Garmin help line and they sent me out a new car charger. The system is fun to use and easy to learn."
5,Restorative Vibrational Sounds,"I have listened to these wonderful healing pieces of music for some years now. I play them in my home where I find they calm everyone(including my 2 teenagers!) and bring a nurturing vibration to the whole house. I use Wispers in my therapy office during my Integrative Body Work sessions. The tones help the work to go deeper, allow better integration and call to the highest good for soul's will. I also enjoy listening in the car, especially when life feels like a pressure tank, they ease and sooth me. We are blessed by Chase and his willingness to do this work and share it with the universe. These CDs are for everyone, I highly recommend them!!"
4,My Nephew Loves this Toy!,"I bought this plane for my nephew, who just turned 6 years old. He has had the toy for almost 1 week, and so far he loves it. The batteries do drain quickly (as the previous reviewer noted), but the recharging is very, very quick. For a 6-year old with very little patience, he does not seem to mind waiting a few minutes to recharge the batteries.My nephew has had the most success flying this plane when using the auto-takeoff feature (with a little help initially from his older, teenage brother). He has been playing with this toy in the backyard (away from concrete sidewalks) and so far the plane has survived multiple landings with no major damage (just a few scratches). Although a bit expensive, I am very happy with this purchase so far."
1,Garbage,"This worked well for about one hour. After that, it wouldn't hold a charge. Even when it did work, it would take a long time to get it to indicate a full charge. Remote control has an extremely limited range (about 10 feet). One of the worst toys we ever bought our kids"
5,Quality item and fast shipping,"This is one of the best Cathedrals albums. The CD came packaged very well, and was in excellent condition, exceeding the posted description of the CD."
3,No light,"This sight has no sight light as shown in the products picture. The pkg that the sight was in has a compartment for the light, but light has been removed."
1,doesn't glow,"Unless you remanufacture your pins with some longer glow tubes this sight is garbage. The pins don't glow AT ALL. The little tiny coil of material doesnt collect any light at all without an additional sight light, NOT INCLUDED IN THIS VERSION. I bought this sight after replacing my peep to get bigger sight housing to fix my sight picture. However as I said already, the pins don't glow AT ALL. So I cannibalized my old sight to get the glow tubes out of my old pins and install on these pins. It makes the sight 100% better, as it is unusable out of the box imo.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere unless you have the time and materials to repair/remanufacture this sight.TLDR: the pins don't glow and there is no light included in this version."
4,Sight,The tru glo sight is just what i needed. The only problem I have is that the picture does not match the product in full. It did not come with the light. Other than that I'm pleased.
4,great sound,great sound from these component speakers they changed completely my in-car experience definetly worth upgrading to. throw away your OEM speakers and get this ones.
1,Aweful,1 of the 3 worst movies I have ever seen and I have seen alot of movies. Wish I had my money back and the 29 min I watched it hoping it would get better! Glad I was doing something else while watching it or it would have been a total waste of time I will never get back.
5,Dancin' !!,"Whether taking a swipe at old traditional tunes or writing their own, Boiled in Lead have a flair... They update Celtic, English, and gypsy styles in a rockin ""alternative"" manner. Of their albums, this one appears to be the best. Certainly, it is the most played in this household. (As a side note, my one time seeing them perform live was a real treat.)"
1,Warrior Elite Reincarnated,"Very disappointed.This book appears to have been thrown together very quickly. I read the Warrior Elite and really enjoyed it. My hopes were similar for the latest Couch book about BUD/S. Instead of giving the reader current pictures from BUD/S classes Couch reused pictures from his Warrior Elite book. The pictures are old and outdated.Worst of all, reading To Be a Navy SEAL gave me an uncomfortable sense of Deja Vu. Reason being most of the text was ""cut and pasted"" from the Warrior Elite.Read the Warrior Elite. Don't waste your time and money on this rude afterthought of a project."
3,"Some good information, but writing is confusing","I think this book is good for those practicing Santeria - but I think the book may have not been written originally in English. It reads like it was poorly translated, so its hard to say what the writer meant for the book to say. I good reference for Esu initates, worth having on the bookshelf to pull out from time to time when you need some inspiration."
1,incorrect track listings,"i was really looking foward to recieving this cd, as i was purchasing it for 2 songs only that i was keen on, track 16 menergy -patrick cowley and track 18 trans x -living on video as it turns out when i recieved the cd the track listing contains no such songs :( grrr , wasted time money and effort, anyway hopefully my post enables others to not make the same mistake, it would seem 12 tracks are correctly listed ( i did not open it i sent it straight back) i wouldnt take a chance on that!"
3,great eyecandy,"The best part is obviously the eye candy. Didnt learn anything new but it was great ""non thinking"" entertainment. its ok."
3,Too Beautiful,"These are stunning photgraphs of one of the most beautiful rural parts of the world, but they left me vaguely dissatisfied. Subsequently I realized why--there are very few people in them. If you are interested in the architecture of the Dordogne, you will probably enjoy it. But if, like I, you are interested in obtaining a feeling for the region and its people, this is not the right book."
5,Awesome,Fits my Porsche and Im loving the Red color on the gas cap. Works well and is very inexpensinve. I reccomend to anyone looking for a cool descent replacement cap.
1,FREAKY NOISES IN THE NIGHT!,"This system worked great for me for about four years. It was fine for a secondary bedroom sound system UNTIL weird noises started coming out of the rear speakers. I disconnected them and just used it as a 2.1 system. That was ok...UNTIL...one night while I was sleeping the thing turned on and started playing a dvd at FULL volume! Needless to say I was quite freaked out and unplugged the whole unit. I saved the speakers because they are ok for a bedroom and chucked the receiver in the recycle bin.I would stay completely away from this system unless you like being freaked out in the middle of the night, and that is if you can even find it anymore. The speaker are ok, but the receiver is junk."
5,Economic common sense!!,"A continuation of Black labor White wealth, this account is a program of action for those interested with the implimentaion of the economic model based on Powernomics and the fascinating industries available for exploitation within certain communities. Additionally this addition has updated stats and excellent examples of programs designed to help control-preserve community economic development and culture as well as history...to protect communities from outsiders with their own interests thru ethno-aggregation and consolidation urban communities can learn to impliment basic protective procedures. Fascinating far reaching analysis, that should be of interest for those areas facing population displacement thru gentrification. If developed properly this Powerenomics plan can serve areas well into the next century and beyond."
2,Bravo! The Time Has Come,"This is an extremely powerful idea. Nevertheless, what the author has in mind, to say the least, is a most daunting task. Which, of course, begs the question: has the author successfully employed the aims of his book?Inasmuch as Dr. Anderson's concepts require extraordinary organizational skills, superb fund-raising ability, a working economic model that one can study and follow, and a profound understanding of the behavioral sciences, Powernomics comes up measurably short regarding the aforementioned disciplines.Finally, a book you have to read ""Diary Of An Investment Banker"", is far better, ..., Powernomics is worthy of some consideration.James Rothschild,Economist"
5,Great Insight into the Internet Future,Excellent Book! Bill Quain is right on as to how we think as consumers and what will happen in the future as we roll into the new millenium.
2,Overzealous,"Quixtar has caught my attention (or perhaps the other way around) in the last few weeks and this new friend asked me to read this book. He had an entire library of books and tapes since he started in this business.Unfortunately Bill Quain talked too much. He called all other distribution systems evil. He says that when you buy at discount, you ""create liabilities"" and these shops ""create wealth"", while when you ""shop smarter, not cheaper"", you ""create assets"" on your way to financial freedom -- whatever the product is.He talked endlessly about this, I snapped out of the spell.On the plus side, though. The book discusses tricks merchandisers use to increase sales. It also convinced me that saving my time is more valuable than saving a few dollars in discount stores. Indeed, rich people spend their time creating assets, not liabilities. They invest their time. For that lesson I give this book two stars."
1,A recruiting tool for Amway / Quixtar,"When reading this, it's important to keep in mind this is not a book or study - it's a recruiting tool handed out to new recruits into the Amway / Quixtar line. It's not about a revelation of retailing - it's a story that tries to justify the Quixtar model of business. As such, its about 80% anecdotes and fluff, with very little meat or factual foundation.Of course, passions about MLM marketing, and Amway in particular, run high on both sides of the debate. I won't get into this debate here (although I notice a lot of the five star reviews for this book mimic the mindless ""Ambot"" mantras they use to prevent skeptical thinking towards Amway.)For anyone seriously considering the merits of this book, I'd just say do a google search on ""Quixtar"" and see what you come up with. Read some of the positive and negative sites, and then make up your own mind."
1,Where's the business?,"If this was a legitimate source of info on do-it-yourself capitalism, there certainly would have been more detail in the book as to just how your business is set up, runs and maintains itself. Instead I found 90% hype and an invitation to go to a stranger's house with seven other couples to see the real story on a whiteboard.Costco is used as the success story of referral marketing in these circles being both idealized for it's moneymaking power from referral business and demonized as the evil profit seeking corporation. If Costco is sucking the lifeblood from us in profits and suckering us with the prospect of savings through bulk buying, what's the difference if we through quixtar are doing the same to our friends with inflated prices on our goods? Oh yeah, I forgot. They're making money too, doing it to everyone else. Sorry guys."
5,Outstanding reference for those studying herbalism,"I have used this book endless times when writing up monographs for my own library; it is a thorough, complete & invaluable resource for any studying to become a Master Herbalist or even for those who wish to increase their knowledge of plant medicine. As the people of NOLA learned, plant medicine can be life-saving; many of our pharmaceuticals (better than 80%) have their basis in the plant world &, as such, have a natural ""synergy"" which cannot be duplicated in a lab. This is an excellent reference when exploring these natural benefits, many of which are commonly available or can be easily grown.Herbal Vade Mecum has become my go-to book when researching any herb & I highly recommend it!"
2,Mombo Jumbo,"This guy obvious knows his stuff, but does a poor job in tranlating his salient information to his readers and the public.I'm into the health food movement like a lot of people nowdays. Unfortunately most books and programs don't cover all of the many ways to get and stay healthy. Although the above book listed is an excellent resource. It's like most authors and programs are trying to be too pc (politically correct). To correct myself a little, most health advice, programs, books and supplements usually offer pretty good advice these days.You know:1. Don't alcohol2. Don't abuse drugs3. Don't smoke (cigaretts and the like)4. Eat move live fresh fruits and vegetables.5. Eat less process foods and meats.Now all of this is good advice, although there is a right way and wrong way to do anything. I saw an excellent book with a good 8 step plan. Search Amazon for: The Magic Of Mother Nature's Healing Foods. I liked it."
1,Not as advertised,"Product is not what it says, when you buy a charm you expect to get a whole charm not a cheaply made HALF charm! I was extremely dissapointed in this item, and feel that the seller should show a complete back and front picture of this item so other buyers do not waste their money like I did."
1,Not worth the price of item or shipping!,"Granted, this is cheap, but it's hallow and doesn't have a back. So it's not really great to put on a charm bracelet because it's one sided! I wouldn't order it again or recommend it either, because I paid more in shipping than the actual item. Good thing I bought it for a little girl and not a mom!"
5,Good excuse for being a couch potato,"With an upgrade to HD cable, this tv provides just what I was looking for! The only caveat - make sure you have sufficient space in the room so as not to have to sit too close - that makes the movement too distracting. Purchased through 6th Ave at approximately $1400 off the cost at Best Buy - and 6AVE delivered for free!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV,"The Pioneer plasma TV engine is the best in the industry. But they stopped making TVs (they license the technology) over a year ago. Prices actually went up as the last units were sold. I was looking for the last model year 5020, and when I searched Amazon this 5010 came up mixed in with 5020s. I did not notice the difference, and bought this prior-year model instead by mistake. It is fine for when it was made, but lacks many of the features, plus an inferior black level, compared to the 5020. So don't buy this one, buy the 5020 if you can find any left."
1,The Decorations of Houses,"I was quite disappointed with the quality of this book. I was under the understanding that this book was still in publication. Thus I was expecting a newly printed book, same as the original, not the ""photocopy"" scan that arrived. Not at all pleased with it. The illustrations are horrible and some of the text is unreadable, very disappointing."
1,Nonsensical Printing,"I am shocked upon receiving this book. Open it to any random page and you will find numerous typos and utter nonsensical letters -- please, do not think I am exaggerating. From the copy I received:""...in the architecture ofwoUK zU oX-uj00 TrV HXUuof the period.""My goodness. Clearly the gentleman who made the positive review posted his review under the wrong edition. I do not understand who or what produced this nonsensical copy of The Decoration of Houses but I think Amazon should immediately remove it from sale."
2,poor quality,The quality of printing and of the pictures was very poor. It seemed to be a second hand photocopy of an original book.
3,The Decororation of Houses,"I am enjoying the book, which is interesting, since just visiting The Mount which Edith Wharton designed. However, I do not care for the cover of the paperback book, which says ""Affordable and High Quality Paperback Edition"". I would not have purchased it if I had paid closed attention to that, because I will not leave it out in the open."
5,Party room Best book ever!,I love this book . Kirsten is such a good character so Relatable. I feel like i KNOW HER lOL! iM IN LOVE WITH IT. im almost done readind it . Im on chapter 10. im a fast reader so Id say im almost done with it. Im sad Sam is dead though. Ive collected all 3 books. Now I need to get a book stand for all of my books lol. I cant wait to shop some more lol. Thanks.
1,The apogee of bad business writing,"I read this little book as part of a comprehensive review of literature by, on, or related to Disney as part of my Master's Thesis at NYU. I have nothing against business writing in general, and as an administrator at a major museum have bought my share of management/business/marketing titles... the good, the mediocre, and the ugly. After reading everything published on Disney, I can tell you this-- this is a really poor deconstruction of the Disney philosophy, the writing is just atrocious (spelling, people, spelling!), and the ""made up"" visit by ""made up"" walking stereotypes reads like something my kid would have written. If this is what today's business leaders are reading... scary. If you seriously want to learn what Disney does, and how, read books by Bryman, Giroux, or others."
5,The book shared the importance of looking at details.,"Details are the core. It is through details that quality is assured. The analysis of detail should occur with the product, working with employees, and in dealing with customers. This book shares how the Disney Company incorporates this philosophy in their theme parks."
4,Simple Truths,Inside the Magic Kingdom was a very light read on how Disney treats their customers and employees. The journey is in story format. It is a make believe adventure of adults who go to the Disney Park to learn about the reason Disney is successful. The lessons are light hearted but are logical and can be of great help. This book is not about specifics related to the Disney Company. It is simply observations of the author about why Disney is successful. It is a very quick read with not much depth. I think it is very valuable to any business owner/ customer relations representative but realize it is not a true in depth look at the company.
4,Some very good points everyone can use,There are some good points in this book you can use even if you are not working with customers. There is something to be said on how we treat each other on a daily basis. But the customer information is something we shouled all strive for. We all need to walk the talk.
5,Customer Service 101: A Must Read for Your Staff,"This is an excellent tool for managers. While a good manager knows the seven secrets, the presentation in this book reinforces what you know. The secrets are presented in a different format that makes you think of other ways to motivate your staff. What makes this book really stand out is it is an easy, interesting book to read. Most books of this type are presented in a boring, academic format...while this is presented through various characters...those we have in our workplaces. I would recommend this book for all managers...especially those first time managers."
4,Good overview of Disney style managment,"This book has a very good overview of Disney managment. I've been to DisneyWorld many times and I can say that if every business followed the ""Disney Way"" customer satisfaction would be greatly improved. A lot of information was common sense. A must read for anyone in managment!"
5,This is a great book on customer service,"I had read this book a few years ago and wanted to reread it. I realized I had given my last copy away to someone who really need it. They story is easy to follow and the lessons stay with you for a long time. If you work in customer service and really we all do, this is a great read."
5,Excellent principles described in simple to read and learn,A must read book for any employee who wants to make a difference. Must read and then visit Disney to really obtain the full value of the book.
1,"Unsophisticated, less than insightful -- nothing new here.","Sophomoric, simplistic gobbly-gook. The sophisticated executive will not get past the first chapter. Both my husband and I are in upper management and have returned this book. I guess with the word ""Disney"" in the title we should have anticipated childlike thoughts and writing."
2,Good. For a seven year old.,"This book explains the customer service and overall business philosophies of The Walt Disney Company. The lessons and anecdotes it includes are very good, however the way they are presented is ridiculous. A tour guide who is not at all affliated with Disney takes a group of business people through the Magic Kingdom pointing out various interesting things and showing them just how great Disney is. Of course it all ends up with the stubborn, uptight last man coming around to see what a great company Disney is. How touching. This book was an incredibly easy read. Almost along the lines of; See Spot. See Spot run. Spot likes Disney. Anyone who would find this book useful should be insulted by the level at which it is written. It is worth borrowing for an afternoon quick read but definatly not worth buying."
2,"Immortallity is awesome, but rearviewmirror",rearviewmirror is done by a horrble band the frgs. It is really slow and is a stugy bore. But dont get me wrong Immortallity is awesome.
3,"Good Ballhead, But Not the Best","This is a good ballhead, but not as solid or as smooth as a Markins or RRS ballhead. I would suggest looking at the Markins Q3 or Markins Q3T before buying this product. Gitzo makes the best tripods in the world, but their ballheads are not quite there yet."
4,Very good,"I bought this to use with my monopod, I have a GH1780QR for my tripod and that is basically the same weight and size as this but rated for 22 lbs, the bubble ball on the GH1780QR is quite a bit smoother. This is still a very good head but the GH1780QR is quite a step up, of course for an additional 100 dollars."
2,Not very durable,This ball head is convenient and stable but broke after only a few hours of use. The insert in the ASM plate that the locking screw threads into just fell apart and can't be replaced. I had to buy the whole ASM plate for $58.
5,Great Post-War Chicago Blues Revisited,"This is an impressive debut. Rob Stone is a powerful singer and a great blues harpist. His songwriting is also very clever. On this CD Rob tackles a number of different styles ranging from upbeat Little Walter numbers to a guitar-less instrumental to a fantastic, slow-burning mournful tune called ""Lost & Lonely"" (my personal fave). A very solid disc."
2,Good Quality but not heavy enough,"I ordered these because some reviewers claimed they solved the problem of the lighter weight BBs taking flight. Although these are not near as prone to that, they still do in my Mossberg M590 rifle which makes hitting my target nearly impossible."
2,Poor Quality,"Save Your MoneyVery poor quality reproduction. Images, pictures and maps, are unreadable like out of focus, dark andnot recognizable. If the University of Michigan did the digital reproduction as advertised it looks asif they used a poor quality zerox machine or scan device. My new softcover looks like a copy of a copyof a copy.An online copy of the original book is available. Either buy a hard cover or downlown the book and printit yourself. I expected better quality from Amazon for price paid. It is not worth $35.00 in my opinion.Joe B. Korean Veteran"
3,"Some great tips, but not for everyone.","This book covers everything from card and plastic structures, to wood and plaster craftsman kits and metal castings. It does not cover it evenly however. Only 14 of the 222 tips deal with plastic kits and kitbashing, while there's a full 3 pages on applying roofing shingles to craftsman kits! Although there are many useful tips - and a couple of gems, I would only reccomend this book to a modeler just starting on craftsman kits. That's really the books focus. If you're not building craftsman kits, or you've built several already, this book won't be very relevant."
2,Porcelain Clip Earings,"I did not like the way the earings looked on me, they were of good quality. It is so difficult to find clip earings..."
3,Book / Movie,"When I first read 'How To Deal' the book, I totally loved it. Then i realized that it was a film, I was ecstatic! Alot of things in the book came into play with the movie, but they couldn't add everything in due to play time. However, this movie was pretty good. However, I liked the book alot better because it had more information and alot more sense - because cramming 2 books into one movie kind of confuses the person who read the book. All and all, I think it was good, and the director did a good job. I'd reccomend you see this movie."
1,"It is like Someone LIke You, that's the poine","Never watched the movie. But some say that it is like the book SOmeone Like You by Sarah Dessen with a few details changed. Uh duh. That's because they combined Someone Like You and another one of Sarah Dessen's books, That Summer, and combined it into one big happy movie. There. The mystery is solved"
1,A Walk to Forget!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"All I can say about this movie is FORGET IT!!!!! Don't waste your money on this one. If you want to see a good Mandy Moore movie, get A Walk to Remember. It is a 5 Star movie. I wouldn't even give this movie 1 star."
3,"Good, but not that good.","I expected this movie to be as good as A Walk to Remember. I was definatley wrong. Like others have said, they crammed too much into the movie. I liked the books better. I really only went to see Mandy Moore. I think she is a great actress and she should do better roles. I felt like the movie really didn't have a conclusion. Hally and Macon got together so fast, it was unrealistic. In many ways you can tell that this movie was rushed. It would have been better if they spent more time one it. I recommend renting before buying."
2,A Poor Attempt at a Teen Movie,"Usually I enjoy teen movies, but ""How to Deal"" was pretty horrible. The acting and lines were very cheesy, and everything happens so abruptly in the beginning of the movie. You never really get time to connect with any of the characters. Mandy Moore may be somewhat likeable, but her love interest in the movie, Macon, is so annoying that it makes the movie completely unwatchable. I wasn't rooting for them to get together because he just seems obnoxious. If you want good teen comedy, there's lot of other options out there. I would suggest skipping this movie."
1,Buy A Walk To Remember,"How to Deal dosn't really live up to the high hopes that one might aspect....this movie flopped in theaters and is certainly bound to flop on DVD and VHS...Mandy Moore plays this love cycnical who suddenly out of the blue falls in love with a troublemaker at school...the plot is dazed confusing and toatlly predictable... It jumps around from Mandy's stoned grandmother to Mandy getting into a car accident...What amazed me the most was how people and events were appearing out of nowhere...and I hate to say it girls but Mandy Moore comes out as kind of obnxious in this film...The teen crowd will hate and it was definately not worth twenty three dollars...buy your daughter,niece, sister, or best friend A Walk to Remember instead and let the US Army use this movie to torture terrorist suspects."
3,Not what I expected,"The movie was overall okay, but i was expecting more and wasnt satisfied with the conclusion. I guess it depends on your attitude going into it."
2,Mostly Harmless,"An ultimately forgettable coming of age movie, the film tracks teenager Mandy Moore who has to deal with some of the angst-inducing problems often found in an after school special. Peter Gallagher has some interesting scenes as her pathetic radio host father, in which he tries to smooth things over between Mandy and his new young girlfriend. But, in the end, her friend's baby turns out fine, and Mandy gets the cute, sensitive guy."
2,It is an okay movie...,"but nothing to boast about. Typical teen movie. Not recommended for the whole family. It is about one teens struggle with love. She doesn't recommend it. In fact, she suggests that people just get a divorce before they get married to save them that last step."
3,Likeable,"I definately can connnect with Mandy Moore's character's feelings. She's believable. Allison Janney is really solid, as usual. All of the characters are important and well played. It's fun but I appreicated it more after I saw a time or two. It grew on me. It's not the first thing I pick up when I have a choice but I'm not willing to part with it either."
2,had higher expectations,"well i read SOMEONE LIKE YOU and THAT SUMMER. i am a huge fan of SARAH DESSEN'S books, i love them all. i was so excited to find out that a movie would b made of them. however, i was kind of dissapointed. Like everything in it was very morbid. it just didnt seem right. it didnt do the books justice. Some of the things i loved most about the book were changed. I mean, Mandy did a great job, but the movie just wasnt good. Everything was really rushed, ans they only added the main parts, the sad ones, which made it a really bad movie. Nobody was happy in it except for the end, and though that was happy it was slightly rushed too. I really wouldnt recomend it. However, if you do love the books, i would suggest watching it just to see for yourself. If you havent read the books you may enjoy it. SO basicly, watch it, but i'm just warning you to ready for dissapoint. I would highly reccomend A Walk To Remember instead, my favorite movie in the world!"
3,hmmm...,"I was really expecting more from this movie,but what I got was a headache! Thie movie has way to much,I don't think I know one teenager who's delt with so much in one year!! Mandy's performance was pretty good,of course she's Mandy Moore. lol Her ""love interest"" Trent Ford wasn't the best actor,I suggest he get some acting lesson's,he's acting was like one of the b/f on an Olsen Twin movie. I did like the Grandma & Haley's best friend. I think Haley could've learned something from her BFF,she did know what love was,to bad that relationship wasn't shown longer. And for a girl (Haley) who just found out her BFF was pregnant,she sure wasn't scared herself! If you want to see Mandy Moore in a movie,I suggest A Walk to Remember,or even her up coming movie Chasing Liberty. This movie is just to over done!"
5,"Touching, Funny, with a small hint of sexy.","In How To Deal, Haley (Mandy Moore) lives with her mom, who is devorcing her husband and older sister, who is about to get married. A touching story of how she deals when she unexspectantly falls in love. Great movie and book."
3,how to deal Review!!,"The movie, How to Deal sort of a copy of the book Someone you like...isn't it? It is sort of the same except that a few details are changed!!!"
3,Too much...,"This could've been a great movie, well, as great as teen movies can really be...This movie was based on two novels by Sarah Dessen, That Summer and Someone Like You that have absolutely nothing in common, and it shows onscreen.Too much drama, too many problems, all packed into a less than 2 hour movie.Do yourself a favor, save the 8 bucks and rent the movie... allowing yourself to fast-forward through some needless scenes."
2,Pointless,"This movie is slightly pointless. Usually in movies a character achieves alot and has changed at the end. Elijah Wood's character does not, only in the way of a relationship with the girl. He does not succeed in his writing. Basicall this story line could have been better, it is a B grade movie...a movie that I dont think did very well in the theatre as I never heard of it before it was released on DVD. Even if you are a major Elijah or Mandy fan, I would still suggest not buying this - Instead buy A Walk To Remember or even How To Deal."
3,Good condition,It was clean and perfect condition just the sound is sorta low. It was wrapped and everything I wouldnt reccomend cause I don't know why the sound is pretty low like something's up with the DVD.
3,Ehh..,"This movie wasn't completely terrible, but definitely not worth buying. I, personally, love Mandy Moore and think that she is quite talented, but this movie was just plain pointless. I would not recommend watching or buying it unless you have seen it, and loved it."
3,"""What do you expect when you break your own rules...""","How to Deal starring Mandy Moore feels more like a t.v. movie than a cinema film. Moore is pretty good here, I prefer her acting than her singing. I wish this film wasn't so much like a soap opera, the dialogue is somewhat boring but there are some likable moments as well. Ok teen film but I've seen better."
2,Dull....,"Mandy Moore is just so cute. Look at cute Mandy Moore pout for the cameras. Look at cute Mandy vow never to fall in love...yada, yada, ho hum. In a world where divorce is so common place-this movie stretches to show teenage angst in such a loveless world...and fails. Totally predictable and really just a waste of film. If they eliminated the pot smoking grandmother-which should have been funnier than it was-this would have been better as a project for the Disney Channel."
2,Offensive Anti-Male Propaganda,"This is a ridiculously overheated attempt to cast all guys in the same unflattering light. The reason I find it offensive, it is aimed at teenage girls and really provides them with a distorted view of men. Each male character in this movie is presented as a jerk, a wimp, a loser, etc, etc. Don't believe it, there are decent guys in the world.On top of all that, the movie has no real narrative center. The main character (Mandy Moore) basically reacts to everyone else around her. We never get a feel for who she is, or why we should relate to her in any way. The side characters, while more interesting, are presented so haphazardly that they aren't well-developed either.I'd give it one star, but Mandy Moore is cute and fun to watch."
3,Another cheesy chick flick.,"I fell in love with the character, Hallie. I could relate myself to Hallie with our opinions on love. The movie was cute, and I liked it better the second time. I don't think the movie proveys a good message to teenagers. It seemed allright to have sex, and get pregnant. Even Hallie, the good girl persay started getting involved with the boy in sexual ways. It was a okay movie, the book is good too. The movie consists of two novels being put together, but the first part in HOW TO DEAL signifies the movie better than the second part."
1,ONE OF THE WORST OF THE WORST,"Don't get me wrong, I really like Mandy Moore as an actress, but this movie suckd arse! Never watch it!"
2,I'm sorry...,"I just couldn't seem to find anything to like beside the fact that Mandy Moore is in it. She's an amazing, and beyond talented actress, but I did put this under the worst of 2003. It's pretty bad, Trent Ford did a horrible job playing Mandy's love interest in the movie, I just didn't have any sympathy for this guy at all. The whole thing just seemed rushed, and it was quite boring. I'm glad Mandy got on my good side with A Walk to Remember, cause this is definitely A Walk NOT to Remember!! Mandy can do better, we all know it!"
1,OH MY GOD!,"Please...in all honesty...save yourself the Blockbuster late fees on this one! This ""film"" has to be one of the most pathetic attempts of teen dilemma I have ever seen. Too many plots, too little time. The so-called romance between Halle (Moore) and Macon leaves little to the imagination. I actually didn't even want these two to even hook up! This ridiculous movie makes even the worst episode of 90210 appealing. The most mildly satisfying character/and or plot of this film is the reefer-smoking geriatric...and that's not saying a whole hell of a lot. Save your money and your time!"
2,I still don't know how to deal.,"Hey, I respect Mandy Moore as both an actress and singer, but this film didn't do anything for me. The reason is simple. Everytime you think it's going to rise above melodrama, it just proves that it is in fact just that. On a good note Mandy performs well and there are some nice supporting characters like Halley's mother and pot smoking grandmother. To bad the script is mediocre. It's worth a look, but only worth owning if you must have everything that Moore does. The DVD features: Deleted Scenes, Commentary w/ Director & Stars, 4 Featurettes, Music Videos, DVD-ROM Content*, & More."
2,Multiple fine preformances still come up zero!,"This movie turned out to be a schizophrenic combination of every teenage cliche that exists. The transitions of the story as well as the emotions of the characters flip-flop at the drop of the hat. The worst of it is the fact that many of the performances were really strong and the story had great potential. In the end, the editing and dialogue destroyed anything valuable in this film. Mandy Moore put in a surprisingly strong performance, but it really was the best friend Scarlet who stole the show with a luminous presence. If you are bored this summer with money to burn and two hours to waste, feel free to go to this film, otherwise I think it is a slumber party video rental for fans of Mandy Moore."
2,Stick with one book next time,"I read Some Like You and totally loved it. It became my favorite book and I told many to read it. I also then went on to read dessens other novels. But by far someone like you is my favorite. by chance a friend and i rented ""how to deal"", i did not know at all that is was based on the two books. Within the first few minutes I realized it was directly quoting my fave book and got my book to make sure iwasnt crazy. I was so excited! Then it turned for the worse. Both books were great but trying to squeeze all the stuff in one movie was horrible. One thing i loved about someone like you was the close relationship that the two friends had and in the movie i think they showed her friend like 3 times. I was very dispaointed and would not recomend wbuying this movie. Not just that it goes against the books but because it just isnt a great movie. if u really want to see it, rentit first, and see for your self."
2,Too Stressful,"Mandy Moore's talents can't save this teenage soap opera. ""How to Deal"" crams in everything that might occur in many teenagers' lives into Halley Martin's (Moore) life. Parents get a divorce, a friend passes away unexpectedly, another friend becomes pregnant, her sister's about to get married and her father gets remarried. I'm forgetting something... oh yeah, there's a guy named Macon (Trent Ford), rhymes with bacon trying to get with Halley. There's not too much chemistry and ""A Walk to Remember"" fans will be disappointed. If anything, this movie has extremely funny moments. Like when, Macon tried to throw leaves at Halley, but she blew it back in his face with a leaf blower. What a genius. Then the grandma who liked the other kind of leaves... Wow, this movie made me think that teenagers really don't know how to deal with any problems. Lame."
2,Two hours of my life I'll never get back,"Full of cliches, this movie tried to be like every 80's teen movie starring Molly Wingwall made but falls remarkably short. The chemestry between Macon and Halley as well as her sister and fiance is completely wrong. The believability of this movie is zero and the entertainment value is only slightly higher than that.I've seen worst, but this movie is not recommended at all."
4,Good movie.,It came on time and was in great condtion! Thanks for staying true to what you wrote on your website.
5,facets of a diamond,"This is an extraordinary book of depth and insight, not to be hurried though, to be dipped into time and time again to be refreshed by the wisdom and compassion contained in its pages."
4,Quick Studies: James - Revelation,"I have found this book to be very helpful. It is simplistic and during my lessons I try to elaborate or come up with more creative ways to make the class flow.It does a good job at bringing out some important issues in each chapter of James - Revelation. But it is definitely a ""quick"" kind of guide. If you want more in-depth approaches I would recommend using something else."
4,"""Born-Again"" indoctrination for the wee ones","The little racoon (symbolizing your kid) flies a spaceship (his life) which must be run strictly according to the instruction manual (the Bible), as if all of life's questions have simple, clear-cut answers. In comes a bad old goat-professor (symbolizing the Greek ideal of earthly knowledge and dressed like Charles Darwin) to urge the kid to think for himself, which, in the author's view, means trouble. Any parent who inculcates their kid with these notions is guilty of child abuse, and the rest of us will have to defend our rights from him when he grows up and discovers that everyone is not just like his family. The illustrator, Glen Keane, is superb, and a really nice guy, but this book is strictly 700 Club."
4,Great for Travel,"I just returned from vacation with my 3 yr old daughter and her 3 yr old cousin. They loved using the Aquadoodle mats in restaurants while waiting for dinner and on the plane. They enjoyed the Elmo's World and Disney Princess ones. My daughter has the regular Aquadoodle and gets bored easily because of the one color. At least these mats have different colors. For travel, they are excellent."
5,Best invention since the soothing sounds aquarium,"My daughter loves to color, but markers are not an option for a 2 year old. She is also obsessed with Elmos world. So, this toy satisfies it all. I highly reccomend this toy for the artists under 4 out there. What fun, and keeps them occupied and away from the TV!"
5,Good clean fun!,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter (b/c a friend had it and her son loved it). She loves it! It has four ""coloring sheets"" and a water pen with a soft ""marker"" tip that you fill with water. My daughter loves this!!! She ""colors"" with the water pen and color appears on the page. When she is done it dries and is ready to be colored on again. The color does not come off and the only ""mess"" that could happen would be the water from the pen (a very small amount)and she has not been able to get the pen apart. This is great for traveling, church, or any time they need to be entertained quietly and mess free!!!"
1,Do not recommend this toy,I thought it was a waste of money. Doesn't hold a child's interst after the first few seconds. Pen keeps needing to be refilled with water. Children prefer crayons and paper better than this.
1,Not a good buy,"This was particle board all the way, complete with about a million pieces of plastic cheap parts to put together with. It took two days to builds and when it was done it was already chipped and split. I ended up purchasing a dresser from a furniture store and giving this one to the delivery driver. Bad purchase."
4,good dresser for the price,"pros- good for the price- light weight- more storage room than I thought- looks goodcons- not easy to put together- probably won't last ""tough"" use or many years because it is cheaper material"
3,Looks good. Quality - Cheap,"The product itself is okay (I won't say good because I can get better stuff for similar price from Ikea, but the quality of the materials is really bad. Some of the drawers ends were chipping off and coming apart right when we were assembling it and the handles are of very cheap quality. I don't think it will survive a move. I don't hate it because I sort of knew what I was getting when I ordered it. I've bought this one because it is one of the very few dresers which fits our entry way."
2,Very Conservative & Outdated info,"I bought this book because my husband and I were going on a business trip to Taiwan, April 2008. It's an inexpensive little book, a quick read, and was probably useful 10 or 15 years ago. We found the advice outdated - the business people we dealt with were much more casual in dress and manner than the book described. The advice not to wear red, white, or black clothing was ludicrous -- I saw 100's of Taiwanese wearing these colors, alone, or in combination. I don't know if there is a better book out there, but take any advice in this book with a very large grain of salt. We were very over dressed. The young people dress in same variety as Americans -- shorts on older people (like me - 40 something) are common - just not super short. Because of this book, I prepared for a conservative, formal country, and that's not what I found."
3,Handy for college students,This book was quite a handy reference manual while I was attending Ming Chuan Univeristy...quite a different culture than Austrailia!
4,Snuggly,"All of my children have had favorite blankets that have a silky side and a soft fluffy size. I bought this blanket for my newest addition to our family and was not disappointed. The only thing that would have made the blanket better would be some type of binding on the edge. This blanket simply has a seam that joins the front and back. If there was some sort of binidng or additional seam I think it would be stronger and therefore last longer. Once this edge starts to fray there is going to be nothing to stop it from running down the whole blanket. The colors are nice, the size is perfect and it washes up nicely. I don't know why it is called Day at the Zoo since there really isn't a connection to animals or anything. It is just a multi squared pattern alternating between white, yellow and blue. It is very cute."
2,Protective Mask Box,"Beware, these boxes are too small for most masks. You might want to check the size of the box before ordering and compare to your mask or masks."
4,Good splint,"This splint allows you to play and allows flexion/dorsiflexion of the ankle without allowing inversion (rolling the ankle). The hinge squeaked a little. Overall, a good splint to allow you to play with a sprained ankle."
4,Get the Black!,"Love my Active Ankles - have been playing with these (recreationally) for over 5 years! 4 stars out of 5 because the styrofoam padding on the inside of the brace seems extremely cheap in quality even though they have held up just fine. I purchased the white ones and over the years each component has slowly gone yellow: the hard plastic brace, the thin styrofoam padding, as well as the nylon strap. I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again, but I'd definitely go for the black."
5,My Dawgs!!,"I love the album. T.J., Taryl, and Taj have icredible voices and together make an unbelievable album."
5,Fantastic for girls ages 10 and up,"This pocket-sized book, perfect for gift-giving, contains inspiring quotes, poems, true stories, and celebrity advice focused on how to accomplish success in all areas of life. Celebrities giving advice include Beyonce Knowles, Shania Twain, and Sally Ride. This reviewer especially enjoyed the encouraging and uplifting ""Fabulous Facts"" section, which reveals just that&#65533;fabulous facts about successful women. Highly recommended."
3,Shave gel is better,"The marketing for this product says ""finally! A shave cream for women!"" but in reality I find that shave gel works better. There is nothing special about this shaving cream. It is not as moisturizing as shave gel or just using plain conditioner."
1,The Secret Loves of Marilyn Monroe,"very boring...... too much of the same thing. I wanted to learn something new, this book just went over and overthe same thing just worded them difference."
4,Almost a 5 star book,"I was fully intending to give this book 5 stars, it's absolutely the best biography of Marilyn Monroe I've ever read. But then, unfortunately, I came to the last 7-8% on my kindle and the author began to explain his reasoning for believing Marilyn was killed by someone else, probably members of the mafia - and there he lost me. I won't go into why I don't agree with his theory, but I lost interest eventually and began to skim through to get back to any relevant material, and finding none, put the book down. BUT the vast majority of the book was fantastic. I feel he captured the real Marilyn - the pathos, the irony, the flaws and the attributes that made her so unique. It's a very well written book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know as much as it is possible to know about this sad, intriguing woman."
3,Disappointed,I always was interested in the life of Marilyn & also the rat pack. After reading this book I am no longer a fan.
2,Unholy Fire,"I loved Stonewall's Gold, and couldn't wait to read Unholy Fire, but I was sadly disappointed in the quality of this work. Stonewall's Gold was interesting and a fascinating adventure story, but Unholy Fire dragged on and lacked an ability to engage the reader. I felt there was an obsession with the life of prostitution in Washington D.C. during the war. The fact that a 21 year-old war hero genuinely falls in love with a prostitute after she performs oral sex was just too much. I finished reading the book and tossed it. It is not worth reading."
3,"Adequate, better than the first one","This was better than the first one of the same series. The first one had almost nothing to offer any player would likely want. This one has a few that are both more interesting and more powerful. Don't get me wrong, there were no outrageous overpowered classes like some books provide. Even the good ones were not as powerful as some of the 'core' PrC's that Wizards offers. Still, there is enough variety that this is a better value than the first one, it's worth getting if you're looking for more PrC's to use and don't mind spending some money."
1,canon all occasion 4 x 8 photo cards,Envelopes were way too big for the photo card. Did not like that.
1,Boring piece of trash,"What a waste of time. I have never read such boring drivel. It's easy to plagiarize trial transcripts and then sign your name to a book when nothing original is contained inside. If you want to read what a real true-life crime story is about, please skip this tedious tome."
5,I was there.,"I was there...I had to testify in this case and I can say that Mark and Paul did a great job telling the story. They captured the personalities of those involved and transformed this sad, strange tale into a page turner."
5,Could not put it down,I thought this book was amazing. It showed how a person for some reason can believe what they read on the internet without using any common sense.The only problem I have with the book was being from the Flint area I felt that the nature of the area where this murder took place was not shown in its true light. The northeast side of Flint is more of a cesspool rather then a working class blue collar neighborhood. Most of the Flint residents where not surprised at all when this story broke.
2,Boring...,"I wanted to read this book after seeing the Lifetime movie. But I thought the book was boring! In fact after struggling to get about halfway through, I started skipping paragraphs and finally just put it aside and didn't even care enough to finish. Just WAY too many details that were not interesting, and it was NOT the kind of book that you could not put down. In fact I put it down many times and didn't pick it up for days at a time. I don't get all the five star reviews either. I liked the movie MUCH better!"
2,Disappointing.....But One Recommendation,"I picked up this book here after seeing the made for TV movie about the case and decided I wanted to get a more thorough look into the story. This is one of those rare cases where the book was definitely not better than the movie. Even though they obviously changed some of the story and characters for the movie, I did not find myself any more informed in regard to anything behind the scenes after reading this entire book. It was very bland and not very well laid out in my opinion. The only people I would recommend this book too is any man, (or woman for that matter) out there that is either thinking about, or already embroiled in an online affair with someone you think may be the love of your life, but in reality know hardly anything about. Read this first before going the distance. It may very well save you from a great deal of real world heartache and grief..."
5,"Must read, but plan ahead!","This book reaches out and grabs you with morbid fascination. The story line is factual and engrossing. Once you start reading, you won't be able to put it down. This book explores the actions of three very different people and how their lives dramatically effect the others. Well written and easy to follow. If your curiosity drives you, this book is well worth the time."
2,could've been a LOT better,"no character development and written in a very dry way that dehumanized the story for me. Would've liked more insight into Sharee. Jerry just came off looking like a greedy loser. I bought this book because I caught half of the Lifetime movie starring Eric Roberts recently and was puzzled by some of the plot points. thought it would be better explained in the book, but the truth was even more convoluted. Like another review said, it was basically transcripts with no emotion."
2,Ho hum,"Keller Williams is a fine FINE acoustic guitar player. I can't deny him that. However, after seeing him live, I can't say I will ever see him again. Too much looping, too much cheese and not enough grit. Light and fluffy. Maybe you could call it bubble gum music.I'm not turned off to the jamband scene. That's not it at all. I was a Phish fan for many years...going back to the late eighties. I really enjoy improvisation. My musical life revolves around it, whether I'm playing or listening, whether its jazz, free or jamming. I love it all. I just find Keller Williams and a lot of the bands (not that he's a band really) that are in the ""jam"" scene to be pretty boring. At least Keller doesn't go on twenty minute quasi-bluegrass noodle jams."
1,"WOW, what a bomb!","I am a huge fan of the original movie, I watch it almost every time I stumble across it on the television. But the sequel may have been the worst movie I've ever seen - and that's a bold statement considering how bad Highlander II was (still the alltime worst).It's sad that they wasted such a great performance by Eric Christian Olson as a young Jim Carey. He not only looks the part, he acted the part of Lloyd to perfection. Derek Richardson as Harry wasn't as convincing, but Olson picked up the slack nicely.The problem could be traced to the plot, there wasn't one. The actual funny parts were too few and too far apart to even hope to come close to the original. The first film had such a slapstick approach with a small enough plot to base the stupid antics on. This film was just a series of random stupid acts.I was severly let down."
1,"Pitiful Excuse for ""Entertainment""","Is it possible that movie quality in America can descend much lower? (Don't answer that question if you must reply in the affirmative.) Like most folks, I like a good laugh now and then but the problem with this comedy is that it is not funny. By not funny I mean it was boring, obnoxious, stupid and predictable. I found myself looking around in the theater at others who seemed relieved that the lights were so low their identities were hidden.I mean, the forced laughter at the skits, the same old jokes, the same dumb tricks - it reminds me of my boys only when they were in sixth grade. I am not sure which actor did worst (or best, depending on your point of view). They were annoying in the extreme - even in the ""funny"" parts. One note: People almost flew out of their seats just before the credits rolled, probably for a breath of fresh air. Do not rent or buy this movie except for someone you don't like."
4,"The prequel, a classic.","I'm a huge fan of the first movie and after seeing slating after slating in the press I resigned myself to being disappointed at this prequel. That was until I saw a 4 out of 5 star review in a Sunday publication. I decided to see it the following Monday. It's now wednesday and I'm still hurting from laughing. Although this was never going to compete with the original classic it just falls a little short. OK, no Carey or Daniels but the 2 new guys are excellent, especially the Carey replacement.Obviously I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who have still yet not seen it (shame on you) but there is gag after gag for the whole movie.The ""one call from your principal will sort that out"" gag is the funniest I've seen in a long long time.Go and see this movie. If you loved the first one you'll love this one. A good script doesn't need Carey or Daniels."
1,The positive reviews of this film are FUNNY!,I rented the movie. Watched the first thirty minutes of it. Pushed eject. Place the disc back into its case to be returned to the video store on Monday. Came to my desk and sat down. Signed on with the intention of writing a review about the movie. Got sidetracked and decided to read some of the reviews of Dumb and Dumberer first...and it wasn't until I started reading the 4 and 5 star reviews of this film that I got my first good laugh. Those who think this movie is funny must have been on something when they watched it. There is absolutely nothing funny about this film. Nothing.
3,Funny,"People need to stop expecting this to measure up to the original. It's not the first movie, it doesn't mean it's a bad movie. The story isn't great it but is still a very funny movie. I would recommend it for anyone who liked the first Dumb and Dumber or comedy movies."
3,Thsi was way better than dumb and dumber,"This was a great movie, I really enjoyed it. I laughed the whole movie and almost got kicked out of the theatre. I would recomend it to anybody."
1,bomb,what a big mistake renting this drivel was.i hated this movie. number one on worst movie ever list.
3,It's Good Fun!,"Entertaining prequel to Rob Reiner's classic WHEN HARRY MET SALLY hits the mark more often than it misses, emerging as one of the more amusing romantic comedies of recent years. Olsen is merely ok filling in for Billy Crystal, but Meg Ryan's absence actually works to the film's benefit."
1,Too dumb for an 8 year old!,My son rented this movie. He is 8 years old and he did not like it. It was too dumb for him and he stopped watching it.
2,Dumb and dumber and dumb,Not sure why they made this movie. Seems like they had nothing better to do. They tried making a movie based on one of the funniest movies and it was a total flop.
1,Bummer and Bummerer,"This high-caliber stinker is bound to go down in the history of movie-making as one of the worst movies of the century. The storyline is random, the laughs are tired, and the ending is utterly predictable. The cast really tried to squeeze something funny or even watchable out of the paper-thin script but to no avail. It had ""turkey"" written all over it from the first few scenes but I unfortunately persevered to the end. This movie stinks so much that it leaves you with a bad aftertaste. You almost feel angry you've spent time and money on it."
1,Total letdown,"This sorry movie is an insult to the original Dumb and Dumber. The gags are weak, the plot is too simplistic and the characters are not believable. This show is reminiscent of the Ernest films and probably could have been called 'Ernest and Vern Go to School', but since the quality of this movie is even lower than an Ernest film, that really wouldn't have worked either.If you want a good laugh, watch the original -- If you want to cry, watch this one."
1,OH my God!....,"...it was terrible. It was probably the worst movie I have ever paid to go see. It wasn't so bad that it was funny, it was so bad that I wanted to blow my brains out. I've never heard a theater so quite watching a comedy movie in my life; the only sound you could hear were people's eyelids when they blinked...Nothing against the actors, some of them are really good actors and funny in other things, but...wow. I guess the only good thing about this movie is that it makes you realize how funny the first one was- I wish they got the Farrely bros. on board, but then they didn't even consider this junk- and if you are forced to see this movie, you'll have a pretty good idea why."
1,What can I say ... ?,"Sequels have to be well thought out before they are made (or so you would think), this one wasn't. It was crappy and there was no comparison to the original. Don't waste your time with it. The only reason I gave it even one star is because they found actors with a close resemblance to Jim and the other guy."
1,The Dumbest seaqull/prequel ever,"Hi, this isnt Mike , I'm his dog, this movie tastes good, I chewed on it for ages, but it was a good thing that the movie was bad and not one my master would be ticked that I ate. He wont miss it"
1,Ain't no joke,"This for me was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long long time. Where do I start, the jokes were not funny, the acting was bad, the plot was rubbish. They tried to rehash pieces from the first movie which just looked embarrassing for everyone. I pity anyone associated with this movie. It is not my job to look for redeeming qualities in these movies. I paid my money under the pretext I was going to get a few laughs and what I got was something like a police academy movie/sequel, that's fine if police academy is your thing but Dumb and Dumber is nothing like that.This is a disaster movie for everyone; the only thing it succeeded in doing was reaffirming the Farrelly brother's status as one of the great comedy teams operating today"
5,I wish you people would SEE it first!!!,"This movie is hilarious... Yes, I'll admit that it DID look incredibly stupid, but this movie is JUST as great (if not BETTER) than the first one. I wish some people would actually WAIT until they SEE the movie... this movie is great...GO SEE IT!!!!!!-Christian"
1,Not a patch on the original,This movie was a real let down. The original in my opinion is the best movie ever made (you might not agree) and this film should not have been made. As all sequels do apart from Terminator 2 it fell way short of being as good as the original. And will all the people who say the original is just stupid please open their eyes -- DUMB AND DUMBER -- kinda gives you a clue that the film is'nt going to be about rocket science. This film is nothing on the original.
1,RUINED D&D,thanks alot for ruining sumb and dumberer ill have a hard time watching the first one ( which was genouis oure genouis ) ill have a hard time cuz it will bring back bad memories of the new one-this move was just dumb-harry and llyoed were too stupid in it-eugene levey was terrible in it-a disgrace
3,Was Better Than I Expected,"I admittedly liked the first film very much. I expected the sequel to be horrendous. But suprise, it actually stands on its own.The DVD includes a ton of extras! I upgraded my rating to 3 stars because of the great extras. There are ""eggs"" hidden everywhere. If you don't know what an egg is, it is an egg you can click on to see extra footage or material, and is usually hidden in the menu. There are so many extras it is hard to watch them all in one sitting. I especially found it interesting how they cast the lead roles, watching the actors audition, and the screen tests were great..the deleted scenes should have been left in the film.Most interesting was the alternate opening credits, which was wonderfully done, yet somehow replaced with the stupid opening scene and boring title credit that was used instead.I admired the film much more after watching the ton of extras on the DVD.All DVDs should have extras like this one..."
3,Not so bad,Some of the jokes were actually funny which surprised me. Olson portrays Llyod well. It's like seeing a young Carrey. It good have been better with such a comedic cast though.
1,Dumberer Than Dumb,"My friend and I have 2 hours to kill, so we decide to watch this movie, in hopes of some cheap entertainment. After all, the original was really good. As it turns out, I would have better spent my time staring at my own shoe tops. At least I would have saved my $10. Dumb and Dumber was funny in a stupid and charming kind of way. This movie was stupid in an unfunny and stupid kind of way. The movie has no real plot, it just follows the 2 pimple-faced numb-skulls around high school. The 2 actor playing our beloved Harry and Lloyd (whose names I can't even remember) are light-years away from even being comparable to Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. The emphasis on gross-out and dumb humor become repetitive and, quite frankly, not humorous. Such a shame, considering the marketing and advertisments were perfect."
1,Just Plain Dumb!,This was by far the dumbest movie I have ever seen. I have to agree with one reviewer that you have to be on some serious drugs to actually enjoy sitting through this movie for even the first 30 minutes. I was willing to give this movie a chance since it was not well recieved in the theaters. This is one of those rare occasions in which the majority was right. I don't blame Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels for not signing onto to this movie. They must've read the script and said forget it. The script was simply horrible the characters too stupid and incompotent to be believed. It got to a point where it just became annoying.
1,Unwatchable,"If you liked Dumb and Dumber like I did, then you may be thinking you should give this a shot. Don't. I'm just glad that I saw this for free."
5,A HILARIOUS PREQUEL!!!,"To me, this is a very funny prequel to 'Dumb and Dumber' It shows how they meet. It actually shows that they were dumber in high school than they were in the original. Their dialogue and shenanigans are hilarious! I remember getting this movie for Christmas back in 2003. There was one part me and my friend talk about is when they see the ""short bus"" and they think it's for them because they are cool and the cool kids sit in the back of the bus, and every seat was in the back. Another part I love is when Harry goes to Jessica's house and everything he does is very funny! If you love comedy or Harry and Lloyd, then you'll love DUMB AND DUMBERER: WHEN HARRY MET LLOYD!!!"
1,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen...Litteraly,"Were do I start. This movie is nothing like Dumb & Dumber. It is so immature and stupid that I couldn't even finish it. Everything related to the first one, just in a more bizzare and odd way. For instance, the things that they say aren't even funny! If you like good comedy movies then I would recommend Dodgeball, Ruthless People, All National lampoons, Throw Momma from the Train, Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo, and Starsky and Hutch"
3,Dumb and Dumberer,"I was expecting the worst of this movie, no Jim Carrey-less sequel has ever been good. Eric Christian Olsen does an amazing job looking like Carrey and I think he pulled it off quite well. Hell, I laughed in the first few minutes of viewing this movie. Bob Saget had me laughing the hardest with the few minutes he's in the movie. The movie is not bad and the actors do look like Daniels and Carrey. It's a type of movie where it's so stupid you have to laugh. Not as bad as everyone says it is. I got this film in a double pack with the original Dumb and Dumber for as much as the stand alone dvd cost. I recommend picking that up because your going waste your money if you hate the movie."
1,Just not even worth renting...,"This was a pitiful attempt to capitalize on a good property without putting much money into it except in procuring the name.The Story of ""how Harry met Lloyd"" is only funny in very few spots, most notably the ""Icee/slurpee scene."" Actually, that's the ONLY part of the entire movie that I laughed at, while Dumb and Dumber is a work of grotesque comedy genuis on par with ""The Jerk,"" or even something like ""Caddyshack"" or even ""Animal House"" (though it would be all of those movies, meeting the Farrelly Brothers, who brought such ""tasteful"" flicks as ""Kingpen,"" ""There's Something About Mary,"" and ""Me, Myself and Irene"").This movie lacks the comedic genius of the the Farrelly brothers AND the comedy duo of Jim Carrey and Jeff Bridges, and it shows. The movie is slow and generally just not funny. Try watching just about anything else instead, and if you're looking for a great comedy, check out any of the above-mentioned movies, as they're ALL MUCH better than this one."
1,Dumberer than Dumb,"This is, by far, the worst movie I have seen in the past year. If you HAVE to see it, rent it. This DVD is better marketed as a $20 beer coaster."
2,NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE 1ST!!,I went to see dumb and dumberer when it was released on the 13th and sure it had its funny parts but it does not compare to the 1st one that jim carrey and jeff daniels made. i just wanna know where...did they get those...p actors for the second one. i just wish the farrelly brothers would have made the sequal themselves with jim and jeff in it and not when they were in highschool. this 2nd movie ruined the 1st one. maybe jim and jeff will see that and hopefully make another themselves.
1,Don't waste your money,"It doesn't even compare with dumb and dumber. It was almost a complete waste of time. It had funny moments, but not for seven bucks. Wait for it to come out on video."
2,"APTLY NAMED, GIVEN ITS CRAPSHOOT SCHTICK","Kudos to the lanky Olsen for rising to the daunting task of mirroring Jim Carrey - he does it with such conviction that I almost overlooked the tragic lack of logic in the film's schemes or the frequent dry spells in humor. It's the best Jim Carrey impersonation I have ever seen! But it's the script around him, the premise, and the film (in every way, down to the costuming) that makes a mess of his Jim Clone 101 act. While there may be a handful of minute comical moments that salvage D&D-er from the scrap heap, it is ultimately nothing more than a scorching bore. Perhaps folks between the ages of 10 to 15 may find this a tolerable rental."
1,Nevermind how stupid the jokes were....,"this movie was racist! Ching Chong??? WTF??? If you actually think this movie is funny, you're either very immature or you have serious mental problems. Peace."
1,WHAT IS THIS,This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. It is a disgrace to the first one which is hilarious. I urge you to please save your money and buy the first one. This movie should be erased from cinema and the director and producers should be fired. The laughs were funny if you are 4. In part one it was smart comedy. I bet the Farrely brothers are embarresed. 110% horrible
1,You cant get into it.,"This is a poor atempt at plageurism really everybody knows that dumb and dumber is a classic in the ways of slapstick comedy which is near impossible to imitate, i have to admit i maybe only laughed once in the whole film it's not that i have a dry sense of humour it's the fact that you cant get into this film if you've seen the original it's not right with the absence of Jim Carrey. I would advise you go see Carreys new film, released at the same time as this instead as it is one of the best comedys to come out in a while, good effort from them and they might have promising futures you just dont make mistakes like this."
1,A Dumb Idea,"Only Jeff Daniels is Harry.Only Jim Carrey is Lloyd.This sequel is a terrible move, especially when it succeeds a memorable 90's comedy. The actors that take over the roles for Harry and Lloyd are just plain bad at acting, and they are more annoying than funny. The story line makes no sense at all. It's just a copy-paste hack job passed off as a script, and it severely lacks focus, something you can truly remember, and passion.The only redeeming character in this movie is Bob Saget, in which he plays a borderline-coprophobic father, and he has done much better in the past (i.e. his cameo appearance in ""Half-Baked""). The scenes involving Bob Saget were the only parts I could remember, and when a cameo actor makes a more memorable and interesting role than the lead characters, it's going to flop. That's just what this movie did.Forget this movie existed. Don't buy it used, and don't even download it illegally. It's not worth your time."
2,This just looks dumb (and not in a good way),"Upon viewing the preview and reading up about this new sequel Ive come to the conclusion that this is going to be bad! Without Jim Carrey OR Jeff Daniels whats the point of even watching it? There acting is what made dumb and dumber a favorite of thousands of people, hell anyone can go up infront of a camera and act stupid (as these new guys are doing) but it takes raw talent like the originals had to make it creative! I predict that this movie will be horrible with nothing new to the franchise or genre and very bad acting. Sorry but it just proves that not every single movie should have a sequel"
1,"No Jim Carrey, No good Reviews","Set in 1986 when mentally challenged best friends Harry (Richardson) and Lloyd (Olsen) were teenagers, this is the madcap comic tale of their attempt to get out of the ""special needs"" department and into regular high school life. the main thing about this movie is that theres no Jim carrey or Jeff Danials. they made the first movie funny. ..."
1,Doesn't Compare!!!,"This looks like a complete waste of time. It doesn't look half as funny as one of my favorite movies, the original Dumb and Dumber, and has a completely differant cast. That's all. I'm going to embarass my self if I write more!!"
4,Decent review of basic economics,"This book is a good selection for those middle-aged, former students such as myself who wish to refresh their knowledge of the very important subject of economics. However, I wish this book (actually it is a ""textbook"") offered a key to its questions at the end of each chapter. Likewise, more visual aids would be appreciated, such as detailed graphs about inflation, prices, wages, etc during the Great Depression and other such significant eras. There are indeed some very useful and informative graphs and illustrations, but just not enough for a visually oriented person such as me."
1,Very Disappointing,"I recently purchased Mankiw's Principles of Economics 2nd ed. for my own study. It seems a fine book but it does not begin at the beginning. I had wanted to learn why capitalism was better than say communism or socialism, or whether there were another economic theory which might make better sense. Thoughtful people need to be able to navigate these decisions. Mankiw assumes capitalism. He does not explain why it is best, for example. As a result his work is useless for my educational purpose. I have wasted my money."
4,Elementary Rudiments of Music,The book is very helpful and easy to understand. It is great to learn with.
5,Perfection!,"Deeply meaningful, perfectly phrased...beautiful... bass driven hypnotic psychadelic/jazz rock with a mideastern flair and a shamanistic message...is the best I can describe it."
4,Analysis and Interpretation of the U.S. Constitution,"A comprehensive commentary on and ready-reference guide to the meaning of each of the provisions of the Constitution, based upon Supreme Court decisions interpreting each of its provisions. Prepared at the direction of Congress, the analysis contains annotations of Supreme Court decisions through June 22, 1964, sets forth the current operative meaning of all articles of the Constitution, and, in the case of the most important provisions, traces the course of decision and practice whereby such meanings were arrived at by the Constitution's official interpreters. Included are innumberable comments on the history and development of American constitutional law, tables listing Supreme Court cases holding Federal, State, and local enactments unconstitutional, and Supreme Court cases overruled by subsequent decisions. Provisions have been made, in the binding of this publication, for placement of a pocket supplement if or when one is issued."
3,As Long as I Have You,"This novel is the final ""installment"" in a series. It is well written and wraps the story up very well."
4,politeness's downside,"We often say we wish people were as polite now as they were in the 1950s, but we forget the downside: that politeness on our parts would be necessary & that would be inconvenient. But on further reflection, it might be good for us, as it was for Dulcie. She didn't really want her niece to move in, but thought she owed it to her sister, & it livened her life a little. She really, really didn't want Viola as a boarder, either, but Viola became a co-conspirator in investigating Aylwin.For me, one of the tests of a good book is wondering what might happen afterwards to the characters. Will Viola's husband-to-be be sorry he married someone who can't cook & is a sloppy housekeeper? Will Dulcie be able to forget that Aylwin was interested in her niece? and so on"
5,"""Lift"" Yourself up with this Book","I highly recommend this book to anyone who suffers from chronic back pain - and I suspect that there are many of you out there. The book is clearly written and easy for a lay person to understand. The many photographs are especially helpful, plus the exercises for all levels of mobility. Dr. Oxenhandler's approach is simple and logical, but most importantly, it works. I know because I have tried it!"
2,Dated and academic,"This book is copyright 1990. In preparing for a 2nd trip to Japan, it clearly seems dated. Almost no account for the fact that the Japanese will take into account the fact that your from the west. Also, the book speaks from an academic background. The references are primarily other acadamecians. The author does not appear to speak from experience.Regardless of this, there is still valuable information here."
2,Tiresome...,"I Love Jon Bon Jovi, reason why I bought this book, but the way it has been written is boring and tiresome..."
5,jon forever,happy to know a lot about this fantastic singer and songwriter and thanks to the author of this great book
5,Absolute Wonderful Story of a Town That IS Satire,"Peter Lefcourt captures all of the business wheeling and dealing along with the inanities of Hollyweird. Hilariously funny, it's a look at what happens when the ""suits"" are taking over and creativity is making its last, furtive stand. Highly recommended."
1,Not into this,"Hello:I know some people are into African Americans, bondage, s&m;, and stuff like that. I am not so I just wasn't sure what I was getting into when I decided to purchase this trash. But, if you are into any of the above, then this is the book for you because it has torture, bondage, s&m;, and plenty of black guys."
5,Lost 4% Body Fat in Two Weeks!,"In her two-mile walk video I lost 21 pounds in six weeks. Now with this DVD, after two weeks I've lost 4% body fat - from 26%-22%. It's a big step up (energy wise) from the two-mile workout. It's also 45 minutes of your time. My wife and I have been doing it five times a week - and it's giving me a lot of energy and I think I've even lost an inch on my waistline too! Leslie makes it fun, and the first and third miles go pretty fast - the second mile (for some reason) is the tough one!"
4,love it!,"I love this dvd, but I can't give it 5 stars. :( My only complaint is that Leslie does not use all new background music. Some of the songs are repeated on her other fitness dvds."
3,need innovation and new moves,"I own 4 other Leslie's DVDs and have borrowed all others from my local library. For the 45 minutes I did with the DVD, I could only detect one modified exercise move -- tapping with alternate heels in front, instead of tapping to the side; and one modified stretch move -- reaching up with alternate arms. So, if you have already owned her DVDs, save your money and wait for one that is more innovative with new moves. Alas, Leslie only demonstrates new moves in the bonus section -- side squats with hand weights, a sit-down stretch and a lay-down stretch. How about, for the next DVD, prompting the viewer to use hand weights at appropriate times? Add interval training? Add pilates moves? I need to be trained with Leslie during exercise, not to watch a bonus section afterwards.Other observations -- Leslie talks non-stop; I am OK with that by turning the TV volume low. No exercise buddies such as Barb or Stephanie. The room decor is new, simple, and bright -- good."
5,Excellent health boost!,"I really love this walking dvd. I probably should have started with the 1 or 2 mile dvd but I don't do anything small, lol. I have adjusted very well and working out to this 3 mile walk dvd is now like a walk in the park. I have lost 13 lbs. thus far and now enjoy working out everyday, thanks to Leslie"
2,Not her best one,"I enjoyed Leslie and the walk was much the same as her others in terms of moves. However, the music is awful. Several of the exercisers are doing so much posturing and performing for the camera that they become an irritation. The 3 mi. weight loss video is far superior and the exercisers on that one are interested in the walk rather than the camera."
4,as not fast paced as it states it is,"I am very active and thought this would be a good video for me. It turned out that it is the same as the other DVDs I have. Also again, it is not closed captioned. I think I will stick with Bob Harber - Power Walk and it is closed captioned. With closed captioning, it makes my workout more enjoyable and motivates me a lot more. The video is good for anyone who just started walking."
3,Huffing & Puffing,I have many of Leslie's work out videos...butI should have checked the targeted age for this one as I was Huffing & Puffing on this one..Her last one was for over 40 but I think this one is for under 40 (or I am just getting older...??)
4,"Classic, effective moves","This is a go-to walk for me on days when I don't have much motivation. It's 3 miles in around 45 minutes, and includes Leslie's classic moves: walking, side steps, knee lifts, and kicks. There are no ""boosters"" in this walk; it's just you and Leslie. The studio set is clean and classic; it's Exercise TV's set so different from Leslie's usual walk studio. There's some talk about the benefits of exercise for the heart, which is motivating. What I love the most, though, is the countdown clock in the upper right corner. It winds backwards as you walk, and on those days you just don't want to work out, it helps a lot to literally see the time winding down. I'm an intermediate exerciser and this definitely gets my heart rate up, but doesn't leave me feeling exhausted."
2,A mediocre workout tape,"While Kathy Smith is great at pointing out each muscle and its function, and explaining proper form, but spends too much time talking and not enough time exercising.I found it really bizarre that the tempo of the music and the movements were not synchronized. When I go into exercise mode and am told to do twelve or sixteen reps, I usually stop looking at the video, close my eyes and focus on how my muscles are working in tempo to the music. Here, the people doing the workout were always a bit ahead of the slow droning tempo of the boring music.I am used to working my upper body already, and my abs, but even upping the advised poundage on my dumbbells and using nice slow reps, or adding ankle weights for the lower abs reps, I did not find this challenging enough to make me want to ever exercise to this tape again, unless I am under the weather and need a lower intensity workout."
5,Quick and Painless,"After reading several reviews of this tape, I decided to try it. I noticed results FAST...within one month I could already see definition in my arms, shoulders and my upper back. I especially like the length of the tape (40 minutes). And, it goes so fast as Kathy moves from one move to the next quickly. Before you know it, the tape is finished. I would definitely recommend this tape to anyone who wants definition in their upper body. Kathy Smith is a great instructer and motivator. You won't be disappointed with the results. I have been doing workout tapes at home for many years and this is my absolute favorite by far. Buy this tape...it is the best!"
