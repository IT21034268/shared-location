3,easy way to learn the alphabet without much memorization,"This book was full of games that children play to help learn words. Although I found it hard at first to resist the temptation to just memorize the alphabet, I followed the authors' recommendation to learn the alphabet simply by becoming familiar with the words. However, I was disappointed to find several errors on the flashcards. This is a good way to ease yourself into learning Arabic, but for those on a limited budget I would advise looking into buying another book."
5,Great Starting Point,"This book offers a great place to start learning arabic vocabulary. After learning the alphabet and some basic grammar from other books I was happy to have this book to learn some basic vocabulary from. Though some people may think of the games as ""kid stuff"" I found them a great way to reinforce my memory."
4,Mumtaaz,"I think it's an excellent book for beginners. The only problem is the transliteration for the tough Arabic letters (Ayn, Ghayn, Khaa, Ha). Overall it's a solid building block."
3,"Pedantic, but ...","I hate to be pedantic, but at the time I looked at this title on this site, the flashcards displayed on the front of the book (see the large picture) represented not Arabic, but JAPANESE KATAKANA - for a book titled 'First Hundred Words in Arabic' ... what???"
5,Awesomely funny series! But it needs to be out on DVD!,"That's my comment and I'm stickin' to it. :-) As others have said, it is a very funny, witty, intelligently written show."
2,It is a downgraded upgrade,"I was a real fan of omnipage until this version. The scanning speed is slug like. The proof reading function has is less functional the version 14, and it tends to forget the scanner settings.No noticable new features where added from version 14, and this seems to be a new version for the sake of milking the client base."
1,"Bloated, Buggy, and Barely Functional","If you spend a good deal of your time doing OCR on books skip this program. It is even slower than the previous version (which was tortoise-like) still screws up the order of columns, is very bad at reading mixed numbers and letters, Takes forever to move through long documents, and just genreally makes you feel like you are back to using a 486 when you are working on a pentium 4. Oh, and don't be fooled by the claim that it can actually create fillable forms. It will take you less time to create it from scratch in Word than to scan it in and then fix all the errors. I'm switching to Kurzweil."
1,HORRIBLE SUPPORT SYSTEM,"The product works - until it has a bug. The bug is theirs - not something you've done - but if you want it fixed, you'll pay a fortune for support. I've never been so frustrated in my life!I finally got a support tech on the phone. I had to keep asking him what he was saying because his English was poor. His answers were nothing short of ridiculous (Nuance doesn't support Windows XP platforms)??????I asked to speak to his supervisor THREE times but he was busy. I asked for a call back....and you guessed it, no return phone call. I can't say I was surprised. I wrote a letter (snail mail kind) to the CEO of Marketing and Support, and copied a senior board member. I doubt it will change one darn thing but it made me feel better.I'll never buy another Nuance product again."
4,Good product,"My only reccomendation would be a better user interface, it can be a bit confusing. The underlying functions work well though."
2,Kung Fu movie? Comedy?,"I saw this movie because I'm a big fan of Yuen Woo Ping, but came away wondering what it was all about. There were some martial arts in it, but it seemed to be mainly some sort of stream-of-consciousness comedy that I didn't get. There's a whole lot of plot that doesn't really go anywhere, and some wire fu that seems to be there because he can do it, not because it has anything to do with the movie. I guess when you do as many movies as he does (sometimes 3 in a year) you're bound to end up with a few like this one."
5,Very Pleased,"I really like the Multiclix system, it's very easy to use and pretty painless. These were delivered quickly and they were a much better price then I would have paid at my local pharmacy."
4,Good product - packaging could be changed slightly,"I've used these for over a year, now. They work well, no failures.The only note I have, and the reason for losing a star, is the way the lancet barrels are packaged. When you need to load a new barrel, you have to grab it and turn it upside down. Accu-Chek should consider packaging these with the barrels inverted already so that the user does not have to handle the new barrels - they would just have to push the lancet handle down over a new barrel to set it in place ready for use.Just a consideration. I will continue to use them since they are needle-safe by design."
3,Excellent beauty tips for makeup artist,"Susie Galvez it's great!!! She gives you a lot of makeup tips and also advise you how to deal with your clients (for makeup artist or beauty stylist). Excellent explaining!However, I gave this product a medium rate,because the video shots are not the best. The entire DVD lighting was kind of dark. And it make me feel kind of sleeping.However Susie Galvez it's excellent! and I would buy again a DVD from Her!I repeat the Video filming and SHOTS on this DVD Were not the best."
2,Some good tips but WOW not a good video,Not sure if it is because this DVD was made in 2003 but really for the little bit of tips I did get I could have gotten off the internet. Honestly if I knew the video was done in 2003 I probably would not have gotten it. And honestly I didn't think the make up itself was that great. The make up they did on both of the clients I don't see how it would hold up when taking photos....it is so light I can see it being washed out when the bride takes her photos..honestly I wish I could get my money back.
5,Great Video!!!,"This video is excellent! I purchased it hoping that it would help me learn more makeup techniques, and that is exactly what I got. This video shows step-by-step instructions on how to apply makeup. It gives great tips and its really easy to follow. If you're looking for a really good video to help you learn new makeup techniques, then this is the video you want!"
1,Broke within 5 minutes,"My 18-month old broke this toy after five minutes of use. The keys that come with the toy to open the garages split open and couldn't be put back together. In addition, the garage doors of this product come off and cannot be easily placed back. In fact, four adults have tried and failed to reassemble this toy. While little ones seem to like to play with it, they are frustrated by the doors. I would not recommend this toy."
3,Hunter S. Thompson: His Final Hours,"I don't really care for the use of re-enactments in this particular video, and it didn't really add anything new to what's already been known. It may be unique in the way it discusses HST's final day, so fans will still probably want to see it."
1,Not what I expected....,"Not what I expected, based on the photo and description. Although this gas stove was a nice substantial size, I don't believe it was designed for the US. I found it to be totally unusable. The grate over the fire to rest your pot on was too big for my camping cookware - most pieces would have gone through the center and sat right on the flame! And it was curved, not flat, as though to hold a Wok. The tubing for the gas was not the heavy type with ratings stamped on it, as is on all the other propane appliances I've have seen."
5,A bit dark but good,"A whole lifetime comes crashing down when the son in this story reveals he is gay. This prompts the father, living a lie for as long as he can remember to reveal his own homosexuality to his family. The wife, although made to look a bit badly in the film was the most sypathetic character to me in the movie. She feels like her entire life was a lie her husband made up to hide. A strong sub-plot with the son dating a bit of a player who just wants to drift off gives the movie a sense of unease. I definetly recomend this and then after you might want to watch ""Broken Hearts Club"" to cheer yourself up."
4,Must see...,A very interesting plot which deals with two different generations coming out of the closet. The secret desires of a married man become exposed after the son reveals his own secret. The movie does a great job dealing with the difficulties of coming out as an older man. It was very intersting to see how the two main chatacters in the film go about their own their gay lifes.
3,"Like father, like son","A circa thirty year-old son's coming out has triggered family elapsing into limbo might potentially ground a TV soup multi-serial.This work presents a mix of soft porno with moralist ideas of the UK of the eighties, targeting a general audience."
4,"Fondly remember this movie, but...","...I seem to recall that when PBS aired this film is was edited from the BBC version. Does anyone else recall this? If so, which version is on this DVD? Either way, this was an important movie at its time and I look forward to reacquainting myself with it."
3,Distracted Spine,"I think that honesy is the most important attribute a film like this can possess. I am glad to say that I believe ""Cranes"" is very honest. However, there are other things that distract from what is important here: the telling of the story. The idea behind the cranes analogy is too contrived and not very well explained. Furthermore, it is very unneccessay. It seems as if the director/screenwriter did not have enough belief that the story could stand on it's own, which is a shame. This is a film that should be seen; had the director been able to prioritize and illiminate the need for intellectual filler it would be one to own as well."
1,There are better books out there.,"This book was only bought because it was a required text for class. Everything the book tells you to do as a writer comes down to this: see it better.There, I saved you a few bucks and several hours of your life."
2,Story Workshop,The workshop method for writer's is more effective then then textbook that goes along with it. I have to own and therefore sometimes am assigned readings from within the text. It's boring and sometimes ineffective but the story selections show exactly what each chapter is about and what is to be worked on as a writer.
3,Hard to read...,"Might be doing something wrong, but I can hardly discern the temperature recorded; it seems as though it doesn't have as much sensitivity as needed."
4,Great Road Map,"Colorful, very useful road map. Little in the way of points of interest, but excellent for navigating the roads. Didn't seem to have any indications of toll vs freeways."
3,Lack of information on description,The piece has a hi quality. No doubt on that.The thing is that it doesn't specify you need two for a complete replacement. They should be saled in pairs.Also it doesn't work for all models they say. (I know for a fact).Thank you.
4,pretty dang fun,This is very different. It is pretty nice but I have yet to orgasm from this. With this being said I am more of a vibration person.
4,We're going up your stairs!,"This is a fun DVD collection of a gameshow ""ish"" programme that Dame Edna had in the early 90's on ITV/LWT. It is really an opportunity for the great Dame to poke fun at people, but in a honest and frank way.Madge is here (remember madge ""the badge madge"")... And the poor people whose houses they go into have some good fun... Imagine going into your closet at home and finding all sorts of things?? Well, thats what happens here.Great stuff."
3,"Funny, but too far.","Dame Edna is a brilliant comic character and has been put to good use on stage and hosting her chat show 'The Dame Edna Experience' in Britain. 'Neighbourhood Watch' also works, but I don't give it the highest rating because I'm really uncomfortable with the concept of people's homes being scrutinised before the public without their personal consent. Call me old-fashioned, but I am."
2,"Spend Your Money on Tickets to Her Show, Instead","Enter w/ caution, possums... If you're expecting anything like her touring show performances, you won't be finding it here. Although I've been a fan of Dame Edna for years, I was completely unfamiliar with ""Neighbourhood Watch."" Now that I am, I can only say I was a bit disappointed. As noted by others, the first episode was hysterical, poor sound quality aside; the second episode was funny; thereafter, it's mindnumbing and repetitive. I watched it all the way through just to see if I could take it. Go see her live or buy her book instead - this one's a rental at best."
1,The Devil verses the Devil?,"While some may get excited while watching Wilson argue on behalf of the Christian faith, I on the other hand am sad to see a Wilson do anything on behalf of the Christian faith. If Hitchens only knew the heretical/Romish doctrines held by this man Wilson, he could have used it against him.Do we also get excited if a Roman Catholic debates Hitchens? How about Benny Hinn? All this does is make for good entertainment for evanjellyfish who don't know much about genuine Christianity. Federal Vision is heresy and NO federal visionist should be debating when they themselves need to be debated."
2,Stick with the book,"I enjoyed the book very much, but was disappointed in the documentary. As other reviewers have noted, there seems to be more of an emphasis on ""hip"" aesthetics than content. The whole movie feels like a trailer or a music video- lots of funky music, quick cuts, shots of helicopters and limos, and people walking in slow motion. This gets old pretty fast- especially when you really want to hear more of the exchanges between Wilson and Hitchens."
3,"Interesting, but could have been better presented","Perhaps it's just me, but when I understand two people are debating, I'd like to see the face-to-face confrontation, perhaps interspersed with background materials. Both of the participants are interesting people, but the way the video is edited is chaotic."
2,Lousy editing. Great protagonists.,"Do some youtube searches instead to find debates on the topic.This video is like some silly MTv show. I appreciate MTv and I appreciate the topic of the debate. But not together. Half an hour into the mess I found myself thinking ""Allright, that's a lot of build up - shouldn't the actual debate start now?"" It never did. I repeat; check out youtube or just search the internet for videos on the topic and the protagonists."
3,Pretty Good,"I generally enjoyed watching this, however it seemed to focus a great deal on the nature of morality. Althought it's an interesting topic, I would have enjoyed seeing more of other aspects of their debate. Also, I thought the quality of the video was not the greatest."
3,"Great subject, irrelevant treatment","The Hitchens-Wilson confrontation is a great match, for once, but the choppy editing, pointless visual effects and preposterous soundtrack almost ruined it for me. Still enjoyed the great debating, though."
2,God is great.,"I was pretty disappointed at Douglas Wilson's performance, and maybe it's because Doug was depending too much on his own whits. His apologetic were stutters and ""um""'s at best. He clearly knows the word of God but he clearly has no ability to reference God's word quickly when needed. I wish we had stronger Christian apologists out there who would represent the word as it should be."
2,Hitchens Hitchens Hitchens,"The production isn't very good - they try to dramatize it with camera effects, menacing music, and bad gangsta rap, but you soon realize that it's just two guys in their late 50's having a friendly debate with each other. Even though they disagree on everything, how much of a ""collision"" can it really be if they're best buds? If the movie dropped the pretense and wasn't being sold as this epic clash of titans, I think it would be a lot more effective.If you're a Christopher Hitchens fan like me, it's worth a watch. There are a number of humorous moments that make it not a total waste. But that's really the only reason. Douglas Wilson tries hard to sound intelligent and does a pretty good job of it, though there are a few moments when it's obvious he's just retreating and tripping over himself"
1,What a rip-off!,"This is a total scam -- second only to Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme!It is of extremely poor technical quality and virtually content free. To say that the videography is amateurish would be an understatement. The entire video consists of a seemingly endless series of jittery, over panned, poorly composed, incoherent clips. It would be very interesting to hear a *real* debate of many of the topics that were glossed over. Unfortunately, most of the segments were little more than sound bites.I've read and enjoyed Hitchens' ""God is Not Great,"" and value his opinion on many topics, including religion. Though I've never heard of Douglas Wilson, I still had high expectations of this video, based on the pre-release hype on the Joy Behar show. What a terrible disappointment!Now that I've blown $10 on the video, I think I'll pass on the book."
2,"The Debate gets lost, unfortunately","I was hoping to see a long, organized debate about the issues regarding religion and God, but that doesn't happen because it's so chopped up into a million different scenes and camera angles, making it somewhat hard to watch. Most of the time is spent showing the two men either chatting on a bus, walking across the street, eating, or doing other mundane activities unrelated to the debate. So, nothing gets resolved and the viewer is left unsatisfied and disappointed. This was a collosal missed opportunity to clarify the differences between the two protagonists. Mostly the film maker seems to want to show you the personalities and human sides of each man."
3,OK,"I very much enjoyed the actual debate footage, and some of the non-debate discussion between the two opponents. But is it just me? - I don't get the need for all the extraneous camera work, transitional elements, and taping of travel. It didn't add anything to the debate and I found it distracting and was kept busy fast-forwarding through it."
1,The worst-directed documentary I've ever seen,"This should have been a compelling film--and it would have been, if Darren Doane hadn't instead decided that his audience has the attention span of a four-year-old. Instead of letting us watch an extended conversation between Wilson and Hitchins, Doane doesn't let more than three minutes go by before cutting to some grainy, fragmented interview with one or the other of them in a taxicab or at a cafe. Also, Doane will occasionally include subtitles, thereby, in his mind, cuing his benighted four-year-olds to the ""important"" ideas.I wish I were exaggerating; but this film is an egregious hack job. Occasionally, for what I suppose Doane thinks is some Kind of comic relief, he'll cut away to Wilson and Hitchins trading P. G. Wodehouse quotations. How charming. But the only relief I needed was from Doane 's ADHD directorial style."
4,Eye Opening!,"The most influential eye opening video in world views debates that I've witnessed. As a believer in God, I know more now that I am GOOD for the world because of my believe system. Thank you Christopher and Douglas for your honest debates!"
1,"not a debate, but a collage","This isn't a video of one debate, but snippets of various debates and newscasts pasted together to form this pathetic video. Rap or rock music is often dubbed over the segues--really awful; zero intellectual value. And, why give Reverend Douglas Wilson more media exposure and royalties than he has already obtained?An excellent video to get in lieu of this one is ""Does God Exist?"", in which Hitchens debates Prof. William Lane Craig on his home turf, Biola college. It is a formal debate, and a good one, though Hitchens never went in for the kill, as he could have at various times. I guess he didn't want to offend his Christian audience."
3,"Biased, but at least features some new xian apologetics","The video seemed pretty biased towards the pastor in this documentary. There were several scenes that ended with Chris in silence, as if to say - that was the end of it. I've never seen Hitchens not have something to say. I did enjoy hearing some new ideas from the xian side, as Chris himself mentioned, and must admit pastor Wilson seems to be an exceptional debater and avid reader.It would've been a much better, less biased production if it was just a full-length, unedited debate between the two, but I guess that isn't glamorous enough, so they had to put in lots of dramatic music and fancy editing."
2,I want my money back!,What a waste! I've seen both these men debate before but this movie was anything but that. I kept waiting for the solid debate scenes but it was more like a dodgy MTV video with quick clips coming in and out. If you really want to see what these debates are all about go to YouTube and keep your money.
4,Very good quality-insightful dialogue,"I have used this in my teaching and find that it effectively illustrates toleration and courtesy in differing positions. Compared to the extremes that we are exposed to in public media, people really find this refreshing!!"
3,Not really a debate movie...,"I just watched this last night. I think this was intended to be a companion piece to ""Is Christianity Good For the World."" That's the only way this makes sense. Because this makes both men out to be very human and charming. Their chats outside of the debates are interesting, and help to make Wilson more than just ""the preacher"" and Hutchins more than just ""the God-hater."" As an insight to what makes these guys tick, I think it's interesting.If you went into this looking for a video of a debate, then you're right to give it one star. Except that I don't think that's what the makers of this film were going for in the first place."
3,more of a preview than a debate,I was expecting to set back and enjoy a well set up debate but what i got was something that looked more of like a preview to a movie than a debate.Was entertaining but If you are looking to watch a actual debate this is not it.
2,Not a professional production --- poorly shot and edited.,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this DVD. The production seems sort of amateurish. It certainly doesn't do justice to the topic or to the two subjects who were filmed. I bought this because I'm a big Christopher Hitchens fan. But after seeing it, I'd rather watch the clips of him on YouTube. Most of those are better composed videos."
1,Shockingly awful production quality,"Conceptually, the film is great, and fills a much-needed demand for honest, open, and intellectual discussion about faith and religion in the United States. As a film, though, it is executed with shockingly amateurish editing and an impossibly disjointed narrative structure. In effect, we get to see very, very little of the ""debate"" and its contents at all -- the majority of the film simply argues why we need such a debate in the first place, which is wholly irrelevant, since we are already watching the DVD! In the end, the viewer is bored, confused, and unfulfilled by this sub par production."
3,Not bad,"The format was not exactly what I expected and there were fewer head on ""collisions"" than I hoped there would be. I love to hear Hitchens speak and I don't think that the viewers had the opportunity to see him respond to Wilson as much as I would have liked. However, one unexpected surprise was the very cool soundtrack!"
3,"Good, but...","Good, stuff, but nothing really new in the ""debate"". Hitchens, as always, dominates the exchanges.One big negative is the soundtrack - loud, bad and distracting."
2,Disappointing and Disjointed,"I guess the producers were attempting to be ""artistic,"" but this film is overly choppy. It bounces from one fragement of discussion to another, with no logical order. If you are looking for anything new or deeply thought provoking, you won't find it here. I was hoping to share this with some folks in my church, I am now not planning to do that. It has a few ""cute"" moments with some good points, but failed to make a strong impact on me or my son (a Bible college student) in any way. I was expecting a debate, what I felt I got was a ""Rockumentary"" of a book tour.Better product: The Dawkins Delusion?: Atheist Fundamentalism and the Denial of the Divine (Hardcover)~ Alister E. McGrathAlister E. McGrath (Author)PS: Hey Amazon, your ""insert product link"" didn't work."
2,Difficult to set up,Fuse was blown when the set arrived & difficult to change. Directions were difficult to understand. 3 bulbs already burned out.
2,Another coffee table book by Benson,This is a book of photos. It shows plan views of timber homes without any dimensional information. Another coffee table book by Benson. I am so disappointed. I bought this along with another of Mr. Benson's books and I am disappointed with both.
5,"Solgar Folic Acid, 800",Solgar makes great vitamin products. Folic Acid necessary for proper absorption of iron. Comes well wrapped. Would buy again. Product received as expected.
5,I can imagine myself as the main character.,This book had me from the beginning! The vivid imagery enables you to fully immerse yourself in the story.I love the twists and turns that make you back up and reread every now and then.Don't miss this one!
3,Disappointing,"Though the subject matter interests me greatly, the book itself is poorly written and badly organized, with stilted, numbing prose. I really wanted to like this book, but I could hardly get through it..."
5,Efficient,"Durable and breakproof, it is well worth the money. I needed something to handle some banging around at a house construction site."
2,What happened?,"Up to this album I have absolutely loved Iona's music. They had a perfect mix of Rock and Celtic. On this album, almost every song has a screeching lead guitar overwhelming the rest of the music. I finally had to shut it off as it was like fingernails on a chalkboard! I hope they return to their roots. They are wonderfully talented musicians."
3,It was ok,"It did its job. My children were happy, although I personally would have preferred the old fashion horse I had when I was a kid."
1,Little Women,"I loved this version with Merideth Baxter, Susan Dey and William Shatner, but when I tried to order it here all I keep getting are the BBC versions. So I'm right back to square one."
4,Wonderfull documentary,"A very interesting documentary on the events of november 63... On the same level as one of the greatest documentary film: ""The Rise and the Fall of the Third Reich""...I consider myself very lucky to own this video..."
4,the witnessses tell all,"Inspite the fact that this video is based soley on the Warren Commission report the witnesses in this film undisdutedly arediscribing a conspiracy as almost ALL point to the ""Grassy Knoll"" as the site where they believed the shots that killed the president came from. But then again, the government has had plenty of time to convince all those morons out there that Oswald was the lone assassin."
1,Outdated regurgitation of Warren Commission fiction,"While this firm does contain a bunch of quaint film and audio clips of the events surrounding the Kennedy execution, it simply retells the fiction of Oswald as the lone nut assassin and not the fall guy with military intelligence involvement. Save your money for many of the other better researched films and books."
4,Oswald Acted Alone,"This is a well done documentary that came out in 1964, when the JFK assassination was still fresh in everyone's mind. We now have proof that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassine, which this film elucidates. In any case the atmosphere of mourning is captured well and it's just like you are actually there in Dallas and DC. The whole world was grieving and LBJ rode the wave to pass unheard of civil rights legislation, but also get us into Vietnam at the behest of JFK's advisors. We now know that Lee Harvey Oswald pulled the trigger from the TSBD in Dallas. But that's not what this film is about, this is about capturing the moment when the nation and world mourned a great leader at a crucial point in history."
1,how to lose the way...,"I think a certain prolific reviewer may well be out of his mind. Better than series 5? I've followed every series as & when they have aired on the good old BBC and series 7 is without doubt the worst of the crop. Stevie Wonder could see that the introduction of Kochanski as a central character was destined not to work & was the mark of a show wondering where else to go. It seems every negative review gets marked down as unhelpful but trust me, I'm not saying this for the sake of it or to be misleading as I'm a truly massive Red Dwarf fan, but this video simply isn't worth the bother."
5,La creme de la creme!,"I have been a Red Dwarf fan for several years; ever since the series first aired on PBS in our area. Since then I have purchased every episode of Red Dwarf available on VHS and just recently acquired year 7. My family and I watch each year of the series over and over and yet never seem to tire of them, unlike most other videos. Having said that; Red Dwarf 7, Byte 1 is the best of a pretty damn fine, top-notch team!. I have never found Red Dwarf to be particularly thought provoking, yet all 3 episodes of Byte 1 raised notions that, though they might make Stephen Hawking sneer with contempt, at least got me thinking! I have never considered videos that bring you down or leave you mentally and emotionally exhausted to be entertainment; therefore, when Byte 1 managed to make me laugh while it made me wonder, I gave it top billing!"
4,Yup!,"This is a pleasant surprise, after the near-utter disaster that the previous two series were. Yes, it's not a good thing that Rimmer's gone for most of it, but here we *finally* start to get back into the more character-based episodes that characterized the first few series. It gets a bit weak towards the end (who decided to let Robert Llewelyn write an episode, anyway?), but as a whole this is quite good, with some truly great episodes (Duct Soup, even without Rimmer, stands out). I was none-too-excited about Kochanski appearing as a regular (and a different actress, to boot), but it worked out better than I had imagined it would. Very nice."
5,"Dear God, Red Dwarf is fantastic.",Red Dwarf is an experience that you must see to be sucked into to. Your mind will be frozen by the episodes as you peer longingly into the TV. This tape in particular contains some extroidinary episodes but all of Red Dwarf is fantastic.
3,No magic,"Well they couldn't do it. the series isn't living up to what it could be. Even with Ace Rimmer the show seems to have grown a bit sluggish. nice to see the characters again after not seeing them after the Series 6 . Still think series 7 is okay, just far from what most Dwarf fans excpected. But if you are already a fan of the series you'll appreciate the tapes. Hopefully the show will continue and get its act together."
1,didnt work =(,"Ive been taking this product for 7 months.First month didnt work and i still wait because some say it will take 6 months to wor..and 7 months now it doesnt work, late period bad cramps and sore bb are still there, so i decided to stop taking it.."
2,Opposite Effect for Me,"I have PCOS and thought I'd give this a try. It seems to work for many women based on their reviews. My goal was for it to help shorten my cycle. It used to run on an 8-9 week schedule instead of the normal healthy 4 weeks. Unfortunately, after taking this daily for 3 months, my ovulation has completely stopped. That's not what I was hoping to get by taking this product! Everyone reacts to medications differently. I would still recommend trying it since my reaction seems to be less common. I'm going to switch to taking just a B-complex supplement and leave out the Vitex from now on."
4,LDWH27,"I am a mother of 2 and after 5 years in a 1/2 Me & My husband now decided to have another baby but I was on Mirena for the 5 years and then started birth control bEYAZ which has made no period for 3 months now, I stop taking BC, because it was giving me systems of being preg. but of course those neg. test begin then in 11/2012 I got a positive, went to the OBGYN and got a neg and a neg blood. So now I am really wondering whats going on No periods for 3 moths and to get back regular my OBGYN said try theses pills in hopefully I'll get a positive....will see I'll give a update."
2,Its ok,I took the entire months worth of the vitamin and noticed no change at all in my menstral cycle or my mood I was disappointed that I didn't see even a little results.
5,This works!!,"I've had irregular cycles my entire life, but doc said my hormones are normal. My DH and I have been trying to conceive for over a year unsuccessfully :(. Went off BC and 9 months later still had never had a period. Saw great reviews for this and decided to give it a try. Needless to say one bottle of pills later and flo showed up with no side effects. Also bought a CB digital ovulation predictor and OV 3 weeks after my period. Hoping for a positive pregnancy test next month!"
3,Average Star Trek DS9 story.,"This novel proclaims that it is a reference to a Viking heaven. I did not get that feeling from it. It was okay as Star Trek novels go, but was not a standout"
4,It was good,"I agree with the previous reviewer, this is indeed a hackening back to better days. This book is set before the Dominion Wars and before the show became mired in the Sisko myth.Overall-Basically a simple story of Cardie invasion of the station and how the cast mainly Odo leads the efforts to get them off agian. So, not exactly a wonderful book but it is still of worthwile one."
3,"It was obvious ""Whodunnit""",The film was good. Enjoyed seeing John Castle. I Thought it was obvious who the murderer was. Interesting to see actors who have gone on to some really good UK TV shows.
3,Durability not what I expected,"The float was plenty long and wide enough. It had no problem holding up a 6'2 -285 lb man. It was just dissapointing that it was the same thickness as the 10$ floats at wal-mart. Thought it would be a heavier duty float, for the money."
3,Great for allergies and yellow spots on eye,"Since I developed an allergy to my cats, I have been going through a box a Kleenex a week and spend most of the day sneezing. With this product, my allergies are virtually gone. Almost no sneezing and maybe 2 tissues a day: Dramatic improvement to say the least. They probably would be completely gone, except for the fact that I don't like taking pills, so don't take it again until I have to. Also, I had some yellow spots on my eyes that my eye doctor called calluses from being in the sun too much. He said there was nothing that can be done about it, however they are gone after taking Eyebright.Update: I'm downgrading my rating from a 5 to a 3. After taking this product for 1 month I started getting horrible nose bleeds. This was the only thing that changed in my diet/supplements. It still gets a 3 rating because the yellow calluses on my eyes are gone."
2,Misleading,Not one of the best of the World War II series that you can purchase.I am a WW II buff and I thought I was purchasing a WW II series I hadnot seen and it is true but it will be in the bottom category of all Ihave. Save your money on this one.
5,St Mary,The reasons why St Mary is highly respected by Christains is made very clear in this edition. The historical background is rich and rewarding if you are a person of faith.
2,Laugh Track?....REALLY?,"I have enjoyed some of the earlier Jean Claude Lamarre movies. But this one made me winch after almost every ""joke"" in the script, due to the laugh track. I find laugh tracks annoying, which made watching this movie an impossible feat. I know when I find things funny and don't have to be told where the joke is. I believe this might have been a good movie had it not been for that one thing. My advive to Mr. Lamarre is this: Leave the laugh tracks to tv situation comedies. (And if you notice...most tv shows don't use them any longer)"
1,Never again,"First of all, hate is such a strong word, so I try not to use it. With that being said, please do not waste your money on this movie."
2,effective short selling,not very helpful at all. video taped from a seminar lots of dead time while the speaker pulls up charts. didnt really give any good tips for shorting. talked more about the screener tool they want you to subscribe to.
4,Well paced from the start.,Nice family and teen drama. Not sure how much is filmed in Kansas City but some good local shots in each episode.
4,"Great Show, Well Written And Enjoyable",Another great family (tweens and teens) show to learn lessons from and just sit back and enjoy together. We need more shows like this in my opinion. I am looking forward to more seasons.
3,catching up,"paid to see an episode of switched at birth.... it's great that you can order and watch an episode at any time that you want, but there was only one problem, there was too much buffering interruptions. other than that everything was good..."
4,Great for Fans,A gift for my sister who Loves the show. This was a great price and now we will Learn ASL.
3,My current favorite show on the air...,"I don't watch a lot of current TV, preferring some of the older, classic stuff. But I became very fond of this show very, very quickly. It's not without the occasional contrivances, and there are times when a ""situation"" is conveniently wrapped up in 45 minutes, but this is a TV show, after all. All around, though, this program has some of the best characters - both written and acted - that you are likely to see. The two lead actresses are really worth their weight in gold, but the whole ensemble cast is really well drawn out - not a bad actor among them. I liked this show so much that I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop: For it to start out good and then turn silly, but so far it hasn't happened. My only quip with this DVD is that it only contains 10 episodes. Why not just include all the episodes from the TOTAL first season once they've aired? But anyway, check this show out if you haven't. You might be surprised how quickly you get hooked."
1,Where's the rest of the season?,"Why are there only 10 episodes on this season, when they made 30 episodes of the show? Why are not all 30 episodes available on the dvd?"
3,Switched at Birth getting a little unbelievable,"The last few episodes are pushing the envelope for relationships in a family and community setting. I really enjoy the series, but am finding the recent episodes less enjoyable than the first ten to fifteen."
5,excellent,The net is very big so i can easily grab my giant goldfish. Very happy with purchase. Not much else to write!
3,Good history of Microsoft and the PC industry in general,"I thought this was a great ""trip down memory lane"" in regards to the birth of the PC and Microsoft. Adam does a great job of providing history and context of the era.Although the text was long and often would stray from the intended topic, the extra info was pertinent and interesting.This was a great read for someone who grew up with the PC and Microsoft."
3,"Wonderful, the one-third book","It would be a wonderful book if you consider reading 1/3 of the book, where the author talks about recruiting in Microsoft, as well as his experience working at Softimage (bought by Microsoft). That part was great. However, later in this book, he spent too much time talking about the history of computer, which I have to say that there are some unneccessary parts.There are some points I don't agree with the author: Java issue. He talks about how important API it is in Microsoft strategy to dominate the operating system market. However he contradicts himself by suspecting about the use of Java API. Well, that's also opne strategy of Sun to take some pieces of this market. He claims lots of biases against Java, which I personally find them untrue."
2,"Misleading, surprising lacking in insights","Barr acknowledges some well-known Microsoft idiosyncrasies, such as the overemphasis on puzzle-like tests during interviewing and the management affection (not so unusual among software management) for crazy long hours by programmers (apparently independent of results). However, all in all, who stays at Microsoft for 10 years and then has so much good to say but a die-hard? If you want to know everything you never wanted to know about API's and why your next release of a Windows release may have hundreds of API incompatibilties, this book may help you. I suspect an outsider could have written as ""inside"" a book on mattters of substance. It's not clear Barr has burned any bridges with Microsoft by what is revealed in this book: was that ever his intent? The title seems intended at face value."
1,Unless you want to go working for Microsoft.......,"don't bother buying this book.For me, it was a bummer, too much ado about hiring practices, and the author does not escape his bias after having worked for Microsoft 10 years.There are too many inaccuracies, like Microsoft has won the database wars, Microsoft has won the networking wars, Windows NT is ""clearly superior to Linux"", etc, etc....."
1,No subtitles make it useless for non fench speakers,This is one of my favourite films so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. When it arrived I struggled to figure how to turn on subtitles then realised there was none! Checked again on the website but it never indicated that it was french only without subtitles. Strongly recommend this film (also Glorie De Mon Pere) but ensure the version you get comes with subtitles - unless of course you are fluent in french!
5,Has all the info you'll need,"I got this for reenacting purposes, so it was quite helpful. Would also be great for museum displays, or just plain ol' historical presentations. Highly recommended."
4,an ok book,"So far the book has been ok in my machines and power fundamentals course, mostly though because my instructor is completely useless in this field. Some things I have seen before and the book offers a more thorough explanation of concepts although the approach in the problems is not usually the one most easily seen by me. That being said, I do praise the book for its numerous examples and detail. The Matlab examples don't really make use of its abilities but they're still helpful."
1,WRONG ISBN,The book sent has the same title but does not have a matching isbn to what was searched. I was sold an international edition of the text I intended to purchase. It is a shame that there are so many companies and people looking to rip others off.
3,"""Kind of confusing""","The book gets to the point on most of the chapters; however, it iterates some laws in chapter 1 on the first few pages that are not even seen again until chapter 4. The book has mistakes that I think are very important to address since this is dealing with a high voltage potential circuit. I would recommend this book, but if you do the homework and you can not figure out why your answer is different it's probably because they are wrong."
5,Loved this when I was a child,"Why must everything have a message? It's a book and not all books teach you something accept for a love of reading. That's not so bad, it's just a funny book that I myself LOVED when I was a child. It was honestly one of my favorite books and I have always been an avid reader. I will definitely get this for my son to read."
4,A good story for your young book worm!,"I read this story as a child at the school library (after seeing it on Reading Rainbow) and enjoyed it very much. Now I'm an adult and have collected the books I remember from my childhood for a bit of nostalgia. Gregory is one of them. I have also collected it for my nephew. It's a sweet story and easy to read, perfect for any child."
1,Very Disappointing,I did not find this book very funny or amusing. There's nothing wrong with enjoying healthy food -- whether you're a goat or a child.
1,Not worth the price of admission,"This book doesn't actually teach you how to DO anything - it's either stating the obvious or just BS. For instance, Dr. Lung goes into depth describing how the Chinese Zodiac is used by ""mind slayers"" after decrying all superstition as paranoid delusion.Don't waste your money. The product description and viewable pages make it look interesting, but it's not a valuable use of time or money. Would not be interested in any of Dr. Lung's other books."
3,its a fun read,its a fun read but kinda outdated a couple good principles hard to apply works better on uneducated people could be better
3,Facial info on page 70 is Reversed!,There is a picture on page 70 of my copy indicating how you can tell if someone is lying by looking at how their eyes move.The description/info is reversed.So remember this:Right for Righteousness. Left for Liar.Hope this helps!
2,Meh.,"It's a pretty annoying book to read when you begin it, but if you skip the first few chapters, it gets quite good. I enjoyed the last 2/3s of the book somewhat, but in comparison to similar novels, it really rates low in my view."
1,Don't Waste My Time,"Celine was one of my first literary heroes. Death on the Installment Plan was exceedingly liberating and outrageously funny to boot. I read ""Night"" only because of the comparison to Celine. However, the reviewer who made the comparison must have never read Celine or been a poor reader. Celine was a genius while Rudan is nothing more than a hack. Nobody cares about her repetitive,ignorant and disgusting sexual rants. Her rants are not liberating, as good literature should be. To think Rudan is demonstrating some kind of existential dilemna is far from the mark. Don't waste your time reading this tripe. If you want Celine, read Celine. I hope Rudan keeps to newspaper writing, she'd be perfect for the NY Post."
3,Not a mechanic's manual but a book on restoration,"This was not what I thought it was. It is not a manual for mechanical problems you may have with your truck, it is a book on restoration of the truck. Not what I was looking for. The seller though is very helpful and is accepting it for return."
4,Ford History,My husband says this book is very informative regarding the evolution of the F100. It is detailed about styling changes and equipment for each year. Interesting read. The reason for four stars instead of five is the lack of photos for each model for each year.
5,Brass Beauty!,"She looks lovely on the tree and is beautifully detailed. Whatever your connection to angels, she will not disappoint you."
3,From a kids point of view,"Its fun when your bored and you have nothing else to do, and even when you do, but like its soooo easy. The game ends like in 20 minutes on long version. The only part that is a little difficult are the questions about like the cast, like one of them is ""which movie do maggie smith and the guy who play quirrell are in the same acadamy award movie together"" or something like that. the answer was some movie i had never heard of. but the rest of the questions are super simple, like what is hagrids first name, what dragon does cedric get, and then they have things like, whos voice is this, who said this, etc. And its all about the movies, nothing about the books."
4,Enjoyable game,"I bought this game for my son for christmas and he enjoys it very much. The only issue that I have is that some questions on the ""muggles"" catagory on the cards are very difficult since many kids are not familiar with other roles that the Harry Potter cast members have previously acted in."
3,"Good, but maybe not for the hardcore Potter fan...","I will admit that I really enjoy the game, but it was a bit disappointing. I have read the books and watched the movies many, many times each. The problem was that the questions were not all particularly difficult. Everytime I've played this game, there has never been more than two times though each player. We usually call the game challenging if everyone gets to go twice.I'd say the game is really for children or the casual Potter fans. If you're a hardcore Potterphile, you may be a bit disappointed."
4,Blistering thrash!,"On their 1st full length Cd, Swordmaster have come up with the goods. An intense death/thrash attack with shades of black metal thrown in, Swordmaster are not original, but they manage to exude tons of energy and desire. Slayer and Kreator influences abound, but the songs generally rip you to shreds and the retro-feel of the Cd is both nostalgic and progressive. The production is stripped down, and the guitars should have been louder, but the ingredients are still there. Blazing thrash drumming, chainsaw guitars and insane vocal howling. This is a solid step in the right direction by these young thrashers. A little more seasoning and they could well become very lethal indeed. 3 1/2 stars would be a better grade; again though, an excellent first effort."
1,Waste of time and money,"This looked like it might be a good idea, but I was wrong. The biggest problem is the centering pin, intended to be chucked up in the router's collet and used to locate the base and the bushings center. It is made from a soft plastic, giving visible runout when the router is spun by hand. You can push on the pin and get any runout you want, except a true center. Not what I was looking for in terms of an accurate accessory. I'll stick with my old metal bushings."
5,kdecker,"I really enjoyed this book. Both Mike and Lucky are well written that you feel what they are going through in the story. I would recommend this story, as well as reread it in the future."
4,Typical Harlequin Superromance,"If you're looking for deep thoughts that will teach you something about life, obviously you're looking in the wrong section of Amazon books! I like to read these books after a long day of working with folks who have truly serious, disastrous events/emotions with which they're struggling. Brenda Novak created the town of Dundee and then wrote truly fascinating stories of each character. Of course they fall in love, experience some entanglement with outside forces that drive them apart, and then have a happily ever after ending, and this is totally satisfying for the reader! I have bought all the Dundee books, and enjoy Ms Novak's storytelling."
3,Not my favorite in this series,"Sorry, folks...I just didn't like this one as well as the other reviewers did, or as well as the others in this series. Maybe it just evoked too many negative emotions, or maybe I just don't understand small-town life.The town of Dundee, Idaho is populated with narrow-minded, self-serving individuals with only a few exceptions (one being Booker, who has his own story in this series). I can't understand why a good, kind person like Lucky-who is judged solely on her mother's actions-would waste a minute of her time on any of them, or want any of them to be her father or husband.She's more forgiving than most people could be (I'd have taken the bribe and got the heck out, myself) and that makes her an admirable character to add to this series.Great character development here, and a nice flow to the story if you like it...the book is well-researched, and the contemporary references are accurate and realistic. Not a total bummer, it just wasn't for me."
4,Delightful,Recommend it for all who are young at heart.Delightful romance.Reminds me of our Japanese picture brides.Who would of thought that the ending would be like it was.
5,Wonderful Natural Remedy to ease sinusitis!,"I absolutely agree with all the positive reviews of this product. It's a great simple natural remedy that really works to support breathing functions and relief the symptoms of sinusitis, allergies, asthma, etc. Lots of info on the internet about Fenugreek-Thyme, including some claims that it lowers sugar in the body - helpful for diabetics as well. Thanks to Amazon for making this and other products available at reasonable prices - I am a huge fan! :-)"
5,In Defense of the Faith,In an age when denigrating true Christianity has become the in thing to do this book brings forth solid answers and reasons for christians to be bold and confident in their faith. Dr. Schmidt is meticulous in his footnoting of sources. He also has written the book in a very reader friendly style that even reluctant readers can easily follow and enjoy.
3,Great Info hard to read,"First off I really enjoyed reading this book, but it was a difficult read. I am not the fastest reader, but it took me several months to read this book. The book is a must read for all Christians to help you understand the early church, but the way the material is presented is very dry, long and drawn out. I felt the points made, while great ones, did not need the depth of knowledge that was provided for each detail. With that said, I feel this is just a personal preference on my part which is why I gave it three stars. Again great information, but not to my reading style."
5,MORE!!!,"There aren't enough episodes here to give the full effect that this show [Waiting for God] carries. It is worth a look, but having seen it you'll wish for more..."
3,Can the laugh track,What would have been a delight is totally ruined for me by the laugh track. It's so redunant. Are we stupid? Cannot we get the humor without being tweaked by fake laughter? What might have been very worthwhile is trashed by the interference of twits who don't trust an audience.
1,Not legal to sell.,I believe these items have to be prescribed by a physician. They cannot be sold without it. This provider may run into trouble with the FDA if they are selling them without obtaining a prescription.
5,Great Camera,I bought the Kodak EasyShare Z650 6.1MP Digital Camera for my 14 year old daughter. She loves it. It's easy to use and takes great pictures. The only problem with it is she won't let me use it. Now I have to buy one for myself.
5,Good choice,"I purshased this camera for my daughter. She is very pleased. She works for a photoagrapher and has a Cannon Digital she uses at work. She wanted something she could use at home that was a good price, simple and still had good color. She also liked everything in the accessory kit. I was very pleased with the service I got. Everything came on time and in very good condition. I have a friend looking for a camera I have already told them about this one."
4,The Easiest Surge Protector,"This little item is so convenient--it's compact, economical and literally packed with all the features you'll ever need for your laptop. There are 2 outlets provided, plus phone, modem and line modular jacks, not to mention the retractable plug. It's the best. There's not another one like it on the market today!"
1,Terrible!! Avoid this software!!,I should have done my homework before I bought this. Just goggle Defender pro and almost all the blog and product reviews are negative. I have a XPS/Dimension 600 Dell with 512GB hard drive with 2gb memory. A pretty nice computer!! Well I already had this so i thought I would at least try it. BIG MISTAKE!!! My computer locked up and it took me an hour to get to a point were I could remove this garbage!!Don't do it!!!!
1,AWFUL! Choose another book!!,"This book is terrible. It is written in an outline format, impossible to read, a complete joke and waste of money. I guarantee this will be a paperweight if you are silly enough to buy it."
1,Below expectations...,The format in this book is below expectations. It is as though I was using someone elses' notes/questions. It would be nice to have a book that speaks to the patho. associated wit the many and varried proccesses seen in the surgical experience.
2,Wouldn't recommend it...,Eh...it's like reading an outline...and i don't like outlines....i like narratives with substance...this is not it...
3,"Not Fantastic, But Does The Job","Before buying this, I was using tarps to cover my vehicle and keep it clean as I was restoring it. I assumed a true car cover would come with loop holes to fasten with bungees or something beneath the car to keep it in place. All this was, besides being too big for the car (actually I didn't mind this, I think I was sent the wrong size anyway) it was only a giant scratchy sheet with an elastic around the bottom; something that would not stand up well to New England weather/wind/storms. So with a little improvising, and after losing it once in the wind, I ended up cutting some holes in the sides of it and fastening the cover in the same way I had the tarps. It'll do the job, but I personally don't think it was worth the money."
2,Too small,"I made sure that the length was longer than listed. The car I was putting it on is 16 ft. The make sure it fits calculator was incorrect, it said it would fit also. I now have to send back & buy a bigger one. I hope the next one fits."
3,car cover,its not water proof. it just rained and now my cars soaked. the only reason i bought this was to keep the car safe from the rains while i wait for my back window replacement to come. I'm sad. it fits like a charm and is nice and all that but far from waterproof. and i did expect to see a soft interior but its not lined at all. its just one pice of fabric. inside and out are identical. just to let the others out there know.
2,Description Is Misleading...,"This cover fits our Miata perfectly, and the weave of the material does a pretty good job of keeping dust off the car. But while the ad states that the cover is ""water repellant"", we've quickly found that the ad should read ""water permeable"" as it completely fails to keep even light rain off the car. If you're looking for a cover to keep your car dry; keep looking--this isn't the cover for you."
1,HAD TO RETURN,IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A CHEAP COVER - THIS IS IT. I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE HOW CHEAP. VERY HARD TO GET ON THE CAR - NOT CLOSE TO FITTING CORRECTLY - HAD TO RETURN IT.
2,Too short for my car,I bought this to keep the drippings of trees off my 2010 Ford Focus and it is NOT long enough to fit from bumper to bumper. Otherwise it would have been fine.
3,maybe my fault,I maybe at fault with not reading or reading and still missed something.For this car doesn't stop rain from getting on car.So I still have to go over car again.
4,good cover for the money,Cover will do what I bought it for. The cover will be used on a car the is keep indoors
2,Didn't fit,"This cover didn't match the description. I was looking for a cover to fit a 2005 Jetta. This one fit the qualifications but when it came it was too small for the car. The material repels water well and is semi-durable, I wish it fit, I am returning it."
3,A good place to start your movie business education.,"Renee Harmon's book is based on her more than 10 years first hand experience in the independant movie making business. She provides a wealth of excellent advice on everything from story rights, script development, and production to financing, marketing, and distribution, including a section on video marketing. Unfortunately, the book is four years old and seems out of date on many aspects. The details should not be taken for gospel. Check your facts, especially those concerning addresses, phone numbers, wages, salaries, and legal matters. Things change. Despite this, the book is a very good primer for anyone serious about the movie making business."
2,Unusable English Subtitles,"This is an excellent series, but if you are an English speaker, you have to steer clear of this version. The English subtitles are utter nonsense. When words are not misspelled and misused, they are simply made up. Every line is like solving a puzzle. You must assign meaning to phrases like, ""I'm not shyless."" This series has some complicated political intrigue, and it's important to understand what's going on. I'm sure it's fine if you understand old-Korean, but if you rely on English subtitles, there are much better versions."
1,"Jumong, Chinese & English subtitle version","The English subtitles in this version are REALLY, REALLY bad. The Chinese subtitles might be OK, I don't know. Unless you speak Korean or read Chinese, DON'T buy this version. For English subtiltes, you need the higher-priced 4 box set from MBC. And did I say the English subtitles are REALLY bad?"
2,"Reasonable, light-duty shredder","Shredder does not work with 8 regular sheets of plain white paper. It has difficulty processing four at a time. After about 15 minutes of four-at-a-time shredding, the unit shuts down due to a thermal switch (to keep from overheating). It takes about 20 minutes for the unit to revive itself. This is a good limited-duty shredder, but don't count on it to help shred a boxful of papers."
3,Credit Card Shredding Warning,The shredder is advertised with the ability to shred credit cards. I tried to shred one and it jammed the shredder. I had to use tweezers to pry the card out. This shredder can only handle up to four sheets of paper and no credit cards.
5,Boyz from the DWARF!!!,"This is a great place to start if you wish to find more out about this phenomenon known as Red Dwarf, however, if you have a DVD player I would spring for the set on DVD of which you can now find series I and II. If you still don't have a DVD player and are looking for a good excuse the Red Dwarf series on DVD is it.The first episode ""Stasis Leak"" - is one of the more confusing and hilarious combinations of time travel and quick British explanations (which adds to any comedy). You almost feel bad for Rimmer in the end - but not really.The second installment is ""Queeg"" - one of my favorite where Holly gets the last laugh.The final episode in series 2 is ""Parallel Universe"" guaranteed to split your sides as Lister finds himself in a bad situation."
1,Out of print,"This book is out of print. For a current take on legislative drafting, search Amazon for ISBN 1587330156"
1,defective,"This cd must be scratched, and new out of package started to skip on first time use. Very dissapointed. And just cant stand the aggravation of having to return."
5,"Truly, a Jam Tonight!!!","Man,when it arrived I opened it quickly and played it to my satisfaction and others. Great quality and the racing memories continue each time it's played. I'll probably ""Jam Tonite""."
5,"Emotional, Gripping","Having read the other 3 books in this series, I was interested from the start. By the end of the book, I could not put it down and I was so emotionally involved I was in tears."
4,Good spiritual book,"I enjoyed the entire series very much. Easy to read but also kept your interest. The relationship of the four women, different in age and needs, spoke to me of a need to really relate to my friends on a spiritual level."
3,Not a very good read,"I bought the book,expecting it to be one of Terri blackstock's exciting story. LaHaye took over and there wasn't much of Terri's touch as far as I could see. I like books with a Christian touch but this was too much."
4,Aces High,"Because there is no support for my Saitek AV8R joystick through the game. I had a tough time with the controls at first and was disappointed, but after a few hours of tweeking I got everything mapped perfectly. Now game play definitly more enjoyable!All you guys complaining about no joystick support is untrue. You need to learn how to use the mapping software that comes from your joystick manufacturer or go back to playing on your xbox or playstation. PC's are not for you.The planes are stunning. The scenery is very realistic. The game is hard but not too hard. Excellent balance between arcade and sim. Its just enough arcade to keep it simple and just enough sim to keep realistic."
1,Blazing a hole in the ground,"This game does NOT work with joysticks (well, it works, but planes immediately do a barrel-roll into the ground, evidently a mapping problem which you can't correct on your own - I tried!) - specifically, I have a Logitech Force3DPro, which works great w/other flight sims. This game is a poor port of an XBOX 360 game, and it even gives instructions for the XBOX in the tutorial. To activate the flight controls, you hit keys - A, D, E, etc. - only problem is control surface are ""full on"" or ""full neutral"" - no in-between. So the planes jump around and rarely go where you want them to, and almost impossible to land. Graphics are ok, but not great. Maybe when Ubisoft has a fix available to make it work with a proper joystick, this it would be worth $10 to $12 USD. Otherwise, it's junk. I bought it for the PC, 'cause the XBOX 360 is STILL unavailable...last time I'll do that. Total waste of $40."
1,Blazing Angels,This is by far the worst game ever. It does not work on a PC despite the advertisement. I have a high end computer and the game consistently will crash the computer. It is unfortunate that they would release the game before it is ready to be used. And unfortunately I do not know how to get my money back for a faulty software game.
1,May work well for Windows XP and a keyboard,"I was excited to get this game as I have played this at Disney's Quest however, once loaded you cannot control this game except by keyboard and mouse. I have purchased the Thrustmaster T-Flight Hotas X Flight Stick and the game is simply out dated for a flight stick. I have downloaded the demo for Wings of Prey: WWII Air Combat and it works great with the Thrustmaster and Windows 7 So I ordered that along with Locked On Platinum."
1,Forget it joystick doesn't work,My joystick doesn't work properly and after reading the Ubi forum it looks like 80% of the people out there are having the same problems. I hope I can get a refund for this trash. Their patches don't work either. WASTE OF $$
1,Defective Software,I should have read this reviews before buying this junk.....I bought the one for the Xbox 360 and it works great...This one I bought to make comparisons of the 360 vs my PC..The 360 it is better...no match for 3- 3.2GHz processors (360)against 1-2.66Ghz poor pentim 4(my PC).....Other than the performance...YOU CANNOT CONTROL THE PLANESWITH A JOYSTICK OR KEYBOARD....I want my money back!!!!!I Thought of selling it used here but I AM NOT A THIEF!....
3,Almost impossible,"Hello out there, just a quick word on Blazing Angels. It's not a bad game but I did find it a bit frustrating. I'm stuck on a mission and I just can not get though it. It's probably my skill-set or it could be the program. At any rate I've not played in a while so perhaps I'll have better luck next time. All in all it not to bad a game. I am glad though it didn't cost a lot."
1,Blazing Angels:,Another game that coulda been a great game. The problems it has make it a waste of both time and money. The joystick interface is crap. The flight control is crap as well... save your money.
5,Love It!!,This is a fabulous book for anyone who has a desire to know God in a deep way. Jan richardson is a beautiful writer and artist. The words speak in a poetic way...and yes there is poetry too. Words can hardly discribe my excitement. It is a beautiful book to read and look at. I recommend it to all who are on a spiritual journey!
1,Needless fear mongering,"I read this book during a retreat at a Benedictine Monastery, and I'm surprised such a devout Catholic group would have a book like this. I would sum up my review of this book in two words: ""fear mongering.""This book is rich in content that would make a great horror movie, but short on the true meaning of being a Catholic. What this author fails to consider is that Hell is believed to be more a state of mind than an actual place. God does not send anyone to Hell against their will. All this stuff about fire and brimstone is based on Greek imagery of the underworld, which the author also neglects.In short, I would not recommend this to anyone as I think it totally misrepresents Catholic belief and is more fear mongering than anything else."
2,BEWARE- This book could lead you into scrupulosity.,"BEWARE- If you are the type of person who constantly berates themselves and inflicts self-punishment, this book could lead you to become too scrupulous. A priest told me to put the book away and get into some lighter reading. We should all try to do our best to be good Christians, but we should be joyful and full of love. This book could lead you into despair. While the dogma of hell shouldn't be taken lightly, we also need to be careful not to start seeing sin where sin doesn't exist and remember God's mercy."
4,A story about believing in yourself,"""Waffle,"" by Chris Raschka, is a children's book about the title character. Waffle literally ""waffles"" before demonstrating his power to fly. Throughout the story his waffling is accompanied by a sort of silent chorus of multicolored faces.The artwork in ""Waffle"" is surreal. Waffle himself is a sort of amorphous humanoid figure who appears to have been drawn with a deliberate crudeness. I have to admit, I found the artistic technique quite weird, but I give Raschke credit for trying a different approach to children's book illustration. And the book's message--about believing in your own abilities--is a good one."
2,i should have waffled a little more before buying this one,"I bought this book for my 5 year old in attempt to help him gain confidence in his ability to take on new tasks. This book was too abstract for him to get anything out of it. The pictures were very bizzarre, what is waffle supposed to be anyhow? Even my three year old did not get anything out of this one. We won't waste any more time on this one. Buzzy the Bumblebee was a much better pick and really got the message across."
4,great resource,"This book is easy to work with and was highly recommended by my teacher. A bit harder to understand then some, but more true to tradition then other I Ching books"
4,The most complete version but needs Walker's help,"At first, I found this version to be nearly incomprehensible after having used Walker's translation. I now think that Wilhem's translation is indispensible because of the commentaries but that it needs an additional volume such as Walker's to make it more accessible. My own copy of Wilhelm now has handwritten notes from Walker to make some of the more dense passages easier to understand. Does the I Ching really work? My own experience is that it does about 90% of the time when I spend time in quiet meditation before consulting it. How it does is a mystery. I prefer to think in terms of it mirroring the unconscious at the moment that the coins are cast rather than assume a more supernatural explanation."
1,Maybe I'm not educated enough,"I just have a high school education but I'm spiritual. I can understand the Taroh, The Book of Runes, The Yoruba Dominos and the I ching as written by Sam Reifler or Brian Brown Walker. But this book doesn't make a lick of sense."
3,The Book Of Changes,"A more technical book that gives a thorough history of the I Ching, how it was used in Ancient China and contains multiple interpretations for each of the 64 hexagrams. Moving lines are defined within the definition of each hexagram with more of the ancient poetics included and the readings are probably closer to the original texts of yesteryear. Definitions of the hexagrams are more detailed than other guides but still an invaluable resource for anyone working with the I Ching."
5,"""I Ching"" & ""Tao Te Ching"" were found to be commentaries to ""Shan Hai Jing""!","Scientists discovered an ancient source of knowledge of models of human psyche (soul) - the ancient Chinese manuscript called ""Shan Hai Jing"" (""Collection of the Mountains and Seas""). It turned out, that it holds descriptions of 293 individual models/programs of human psyche. The unconscious consists of images, a figurative language. The Catalog describes these images. All the information in the Catalog is recorded by the use of images. It lists them. The Laboratory decrypts the images and sells the decryptions in the form of analytical materials.Also, it was found that ""I Ching"" and ""Tao Te Ching"" are commentaries to ""Shan Hai Jing"".For more information visit [...]"
5,Most impressive and most complete.,"Being new to the I Ching, I was guided to this book by a friend. Yes, there are others that may be a more suitable road for others to enter this amazing work. But this is the most complete understanding. The forward by Jung alone is of great, great value. So very well researched, a great and scholarly undertaking. A life's work. The depth of explanation and insight is outstanding."
5,The I Ching or Book of Changes,"I have always been interested in about this I Ching, it will give you new incite on this subject. Give a read!!"
5,The only version that lets you experience the I Ching.,"For anyone interested in the I Ching, this is the only version that approximates the real experience. Richard Wilhelm does much more than translate the words, he lets the western mind into the idea and philosophy of this great book. All other versions I've read trivialize the I Ching, this one lets its true greatness through."
2,Complete disappointment,"After having tremendous results with the Olympus D400 Zoom and C-3030 digital cameras I figured it was a no brainer to move up to the Olympus Stylus 600. What a mistake. The pictures were extremely grainey, even in outdoor shots. When I used photo editing software and compared these shots with those from the C-3030 at 100% size I knew something was wrong with the Stylus 600. The best pictures were taken in macro mode and they were sharp, but normal shots looked like they were taken on iso 1600 film. Returned it for the Fuji F-10 which uses the same XD media. Now that is a nice camera."
2,Fragile LCD,"The good: Takes decent pictures for a camera in its price range. It is small. It is weatherproof, which is a very nice feature. Looks nice too. The large LCD is nice for taking pictures.The bad:Very poorly designed LCD in that it uses a very thin piece of plastic to protect it. It is VERY easily broken and takes very little pressure to bend the plastic covering. If you buy this camera, do NOT carry it in you pocket. My screen broke durign very normal and non-abusive use, carrying it in my pocket. Due to the fragile nature and poor engineering of the LCD, I would not recommend purchasing this camera."
2,Disappointed!,"This is my second digital camera. I started with an HP 318 - a nice starter camera. When I decided to step up I did not research well enough. I get some very good shots with the 600, but the lack of a viewfinder on a sunny day is an insurmountable problem. It is worse than shooting blind because all you see in the viewfinder is your own reflection. As a side note, Olympus tech support was totally unsympathetic and suggested I try to find a 3rd party clip on shading device for the unit. I could not find one.I am also frustrated with the color quality. Photos looked washed out and lacking in vibrance. Many require color adjustment after I download them. I have read the manual from cover to cover, tried numerous techniques, but I feel this camera is lacking in basics. I have gotten some great shots, but on the whole, I would not recommend this camera. For the same price, or a little more, you can do much better."
1,Worst camera ever,"After owning a Olympus 2020 2Mpixel for 4 years I expected a slightly better Olympus with the Stylus 600. Use my digital cameras for auctions, many personal indoor/outdoor portrait photos and many landscape and scenic photos. Maybe there is something wrong with my 600 but I've tried for 3 months to get good photos and only a few are good. The 2020 took great photos, perfect color and light, great balance throughout and minimal red eye. Almost every 600 photo has big problems - whether blurriness or major red-eye or wierd lighting balance or lack of saturation, etc. I give up and will call Olympus tomorw to return this awful camera. I've tried almost all the 25 modes to get a few that work for me and it's very difficult. NOT a good point and shoot and NOT a good camera even after selecting the supposedly ideal mode."
3,"one ""but""",I bought Olympus Stylus 600 not so long ago... i was really amazed by the huge screen!!! BUT I was really dissapointed by recording a movie... I doesn't have sound.... :(
1,BitDefender Antivirus V10.0,"Impossible to install this program from the disc. Even with many suggestions from the support team, it has not been possible to install this program on my computer."
2,Don't buy,"I made the unfortunate mistake of reading fantastic reviews for this product and trying it out myself. I went online and purchased the program, downloaded, and installed on my pc. Installation worked perfectly. I ran a scan and it even found viruses that Mcafee missed. However, any program that used the internet now freezes or takes forever to load. After closing web browsers I have to restart before my PC recovers. I unistalled the program and now everything works great. I'm shopping somewhere else for my Antivirus needs."
1,Protects Your Computer Like Tulsa Time Capsule Protects 1957 Plymouth,"Hands down the worse product I have seen in quite some time. Of course, if the rapid pace of life is leaving you flustered and needing to take the time to smell the roses, this is perfect for you. Rest assured that you will be thinking it's the slow-paced 1980s as your computer struggles to start up or launch programs. Nano-seconds will become leisurely coffee breaks, all thanks to Bit Defender's ability to decelerate what was once a fast computer. It has just one more little flaw (in addition to incompatibility with that unheard of word processing program ""WordPerfect""), it protect the computers from you more effectively than from viruses. You might as well put your computer into the Tulsa time capsule with the 1957 Plymouth Belvedere; when reopened, it will be as ruined as the rustbucket the Plymouth turned into."
2,Nothing special,"Bought it to save a few bucks, get what you pay for. Anti virus seems fine but having trouble with the firewall and Windows Networking. Had to switch back to Windows Firewall to print or share files between two computers. Customer Support asked for copies of files but have not responded since. System seems to run slower too. Liked Trend Micro pc-Cillin Internet Security much better"
3,Customer Service is an advantage. Sort of.,"BitDefender is the only brand of Anti-Virus I found which offers ""free"" telephone Customer Service. That's the good news. The bad news is BitDefender interfers with my email delivery so I had to disable parts of the software to be able to get my emails. Customer Service is limited and their ""solutions"" have involved cryptic instructions. Bottom line: after better than a month I still don't have a fully-working BitDefender."
3,Molasses,At work they recently switched us from McAfee to BitDefender 10. Everyone in my departement clearly saw their computers slow down during the switch. It is quite frustrating.
3,Slows Everything Down,"I switched to BitDefender from Norton AV. I was happy with Norton except a $40 charge for each of two computers for a years subscription for updates is just too much.BitDefender loaded fine, and I assume is doing its job well. My only complaint is that it has slowed down, by a considerable degree, the opening of several programs, especially of Firefox and Internet Explorer. NAV is much, much faster."
1,BitDefender Antivirus V10.0,I bought this program after reading a lot of reviews. It slowed my computer down and I could not get automatic up dates. I could not resolve my problems from their knowledge base so I sent them 2 e mails. I am still waiting for a response. I have a friend who is a doctor who used this program and got a virus in his office computers. It cost him a lot of time and money.
1,Removes software that has been used for years,I have a Bible program that has been used for years with zero problems - BitDefender removed it and would not allow me to reinstall it. I have removed BitDefender and reinstalled the Bible program. ASIN:B003YUBRYG BitDefender Antivirus Pro 2011 - 3 PC/1 year
2,Several annoying problems,"We experienced several annoying problems with this product which we had on a number of PCs. The most important was that on several computers we suddenly got a message that the license had expired and the product would no longer run. This was without any prior warnings. On closer inspection of the logs , the AV definitions had stopped updating about a month prior to the product stopping. The expiration dates seemed to be correct, it just didn't display any warning ahead of time that the licenses was going to expire. In addition we have had some false positives during the system scan, and on one system in particular even though we have added the problem subdirectory to the exclude list, the system still finds a file in that subdirectory every week and quarantines it. To compound things, when it does this, most of the time it screws up the AV data base update, and it will not longer update the AV definitions until you reboot the machine.We are moving to Kaspersky."
4,general intro to distance learning and resources available,"Virtual College is not one of those directories of distance degrees programs and classes. It is a good introduction to distance learning, its problems and advantages, and to resources available for the distance learning novice. It helps you think through what you need to get the most from available programs, what you can expect from a virtual classroom, and where to find more information. If you're new to distance learning, Virtual College is definitely a worthwhile introduction."
5,"I finally got it, ""Oh Christmas Payne!""","As always, love the Tyler Perry series. Im so glad that Amazon not only has them, but notifies me when a new volume is scheduled to be released. Thanks Amazon!"
5,Tyler Perry,This is so funny it has it up and downs and it shows what kinds of thing can go wrong in a household
1,Fruit Saver? Save your money!,"I bought this product 8/03. It's now making it's way to the trash. Yes it is laud at first, but after a time the noise sort of blends in and you don't notice it. The Fruit Saver worked for about the first 9 months and has slowly gone downhill. Now it is blowing warm air. I believe the one major flaw in this product is that the fan is constantly running and never gets a break. Air is always brought in threw the bottom along with dust, grease and whatever from the kitchen. I used to unplug it, clean it out turn it over and vacuum the fan area to rid it of some of the dust that would collect. Thought I would pass this along this information from someone who has had this product for longer than 30 days. Certainly you could not be throwing the cost of the Fruit Saver plus running it for a year away in over ripe fruit!"
4,My son loves this thing!,"Whenever my six year-old asks for a snack, I tell him to take something from the fruit basket. Other reviewers are right: it is costing me a fortune to maintain because I am constantly having to replace the fruit as it gets eaten. This gadget is a great way to encourage healthy eating. I have to say that it seems to have stopped working after about eight months and I am trying to see if it is under warranty. Since I am again storing in the fridge, I have noticed that fruit consumption has gone way down. It is noisy, but I still think it's worth getting."
1,"Really Loud, Limited Use","I have to say I really don't like this product. It is really loud, uses a lot of electricity, takes up a ton of counter space, and only extends the life of fruit for maybe a week or two - not worth the additional electricity expense! Doesn't work on grapes at all, marginal with tangerines, but does make bananas last a little longer. If it's frugality you're looking for, it's a lot cheaper to just buy new bananas every week rather than fork over an additional $50 per year in added electricity costs. I'm an appliance junkie, but I'm not sure this one is worth keeping and may be sending it back. Sounded like such a great idea!"
2,It was great...while it worked,"Being a family of 2, I didn't have the need for a lot of storage for my produce, but it also didn't get eaten real quickly, so I figured the Fruit Saver was the greatest especially in the summer when we turn the A/C off when we're away. The produce also was eaten, because it was available...not thrown away because it got pushed behind the bottle of mile. It wouldn't be big enough for a large family.Having said that...It quit working in less than a year, even though I unplugged it when it was empty or when I only had a couple things to put in it. I'm sure it had a warranty of some kind, but I hadn't read that they'd improved it and saw that others had the same problem, so I just pitched it.Great idea that needs work. All in all not worth the price, in my opinion."
4,It's not noisy,"I was interested in purchasing this item as a gift for my mom after seeing it advertised in several catalogs. However, I was dissuaded by the negative reviews on this site. Finally, when I couldn't think of anything else to get her, I went on and ordered it. We haven't tried it, but I plugged it in to see if it's as noisy as the other reviews say, and it's not at all. It's about as loud as, say, my refrigerator or the air ducts when the heat pump's on, except I understand it may run all the time, not just cycle on and off. The reason for not 5 stars is we haven't actually tried it yet, but it seems to me a perfect Mother's Day gift."
2,Short life span for its cost,"I bought the Fruit Saver to keep bananas as I usually had to throw away one or two a week. At first I was very pleased with the Fruit Saver as it did keep bananas a week. After about 9 months, it became less cool until now there is no cool air. It was also loud and produced alot of heat around the bottom of the unit."
3,Good idea but poor quality fans,"I agree with UJ. When my unit started getting noisy. I checked and the sleeve bearing fan motors were just wearing out. Based on my experience the unit was built with poor quality fan motors. If you are handy or know someone who is, you can replace the fans with ball-bearing computer fans of the same size (length, width and thickness) at your local computer repair facility. This unit can then last for many years if the input areas are vacuumed on a regular basis to lessen the dust input. There are no other moving parts to wear out! Computer fans in businesses run for 4, 5 or more years continuously without the need to replace."
3,It does help keep bananas from blackening,"It helps keep bananas from blackening a bit longer; but so do ""green bags"". In the case of the fruit saver, it's loud and it uses electricity. I'd rather just pay to buy new bananas than run the electricity. It's too big to have in the middle of the counter, so I would tuck it away in the corner and forget that it was even there, and the fruit would go bad anyway. It's a great idea if you eat a lot of fruit, but I eat it too erratically."
1,Dangeous Device - Discontiue USE!,"Like most of the reviews, this thing worked . . . at first. Then would no longer stay 'cool.' It does suck in a-lot of dust. So I cleaned it out by vacuuming and blowing. Worked a little better. But there was still dust inside on the fan blades. So I opened it up to investigate (four screws under the rubber feet). Examining the wires leading to the circuit control board I noticed that at least three wires had burned through their insulation! The plastic surrounding these areas had turned from white to brown, and had begun to melt! Luckily we discontinued use before the thing caught fire and burned down our house."
2,"I loved all three at first, now I give up.","I bought my 1st Fruit Saver off Ebay. I loved it and it worked great for about 3 months. Then something went wrong and it started warming my fruits. I thought I had a bad product from possibly a bad Ebay seller. Convinced of the product and needing MORE room for my fruits I bought two brand new. Yes they took up a lot of counter space, but I loved how they kept my fruit from going bad while keeping it cooler, but not as cold as the fridge. One of the two lasted six months, the other lasted nine months. The motors are loud, use quite a bit of elctricity and not built well at all. Save your money. I shoud have learned the first time. Now I have to pay to recycle two more!"
2,fishy smell,"I don't know whether jojoba oil should smell like fish. The one i got sure does. May be it's too old? I smelled a few jojoba oils in the vitamine shoppe when I was there last time, all of those had a pleasant smell (or no smell at all). This one is strange, I am not sure I will keep using it."
5,NOW Foods Jojoba Oil - 16 oz,"Again,this is great stuff--Also, use this and other essential oils I purchased to create natural/organic way of keeping my curly kinky natural hair & scalp healthy in conjunction with the other products I mentioned in other reviews. Good product, great value and I think this along with the Plantlife brand are the best way to go! I think there needs to be a way to have just ONE PRICE for shipping because it gets to be somewhat costly when you're ordering several items that comes from different sellers--Amazon check it out."
5,"Will not purchase lotions any more, just pure oil","At first I was afraid to put it on my skin and have grease all over on my clothes, but after the first usage, I loved it. Used it on my face too and love it."
5,AWESOME product.,"This is such a wonderful product!I have been using this product for over 6 months now and I can attest that is great for your body, face and hair. I use this on all three, in body/face moisturizer and I mix some in my conditioner and body wash. It does not leave you feeling greasy at all if the right amount is used. This stuff is potent, you only need a few drops each time! It last months, and I use it everyday on my hair and skin.My fear was that it wouId not be worth buying it in comparison to other oils such as coconut or castor oil. But after doing research and using it for about half a year now I can attest it is one fantastic, cannot-live-without product.I also love that you save by buying a larger bottle and that the bottle comes with a clear UV protectant to extend shelf life. Overall, such a great product and would recommend to anyone who wants softer hair or skin."
2,Don't recommend use anywhere near your eyes,I purchased this for use as a moisturizer (instead of Aura Cacia Jojoba) and found it stings the eyes like no other product I have used. It melts/smears into the eye and burns. I don't know what it contains that would cause this.
1,Very bad quality,"I've order Now Foods Jojoba oil before from another sellers. But these one I got them from Amazon, LLC are very bad. When I rub this oil on skin, it seems to leave somethings that feel just like fine-sand on the skin/hands which never ever happened before, beside that, I personally use this oil on my face before (from other sellers) but just the day after I put this one on my face it irritated my skin around my eyes area very badly. I had to return them and order the new ones.Something's wrong with the quality of the products I guess."
2,Disappointed!,I thought it would be more viscose instead it was runny and did not moisturize my skin as Id like. The shea butter worked better for me.
3,"good product, consider another brand","The delivery was good and prompt. The bottle comes sealed with tape to prevent leakage. The consistency of the oil is runny, It has a dark yellow tint. I used it for hair. The bottle is sturdy. The Oil smells very strong, it's not overpowering but you'll recognize the smell anywhere, specially because It stays in your hair for at least 3 days. Overall this product gives great results, but the packaging is not very good. The bottle leaks if tipped, because oil settles between the closing of the bottle and the cap, it just stays there. If you are planning to carry it somewhere, put it in a plastic zip bag because it will leak everywhere. It's hard to get this off from clothing too, so be careful. It is not a problem if you switch bottles with something else, but overall, I would purchase this product again from a different company."
4,good but expensive,My scalp has never been without flakes so applying this product gives me a lot of relief from itch and dandruff. It does not smell and is not very greasy so I can wear it anytime. The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because it is very expensive.
2,"No Good as a Hair Treatment, Stick with Argan","I was planning on using this as a hair treatment oil... bad idea. This stuff is super greasy and horrible with provoking acne that was perfectly managed. My skin is combination/oily and my hair comes from an ethnic background of middle eastern and Egyptian. Totally gross residue and made me want to soak my head in the neutrogena ant-residue shampoo solution. That said, I'd highly recommend the organic Argan oil, or for those of you on a budget, get the garnier frutise argan oil treatment. It isn't organic and it isn't as strong, but it is very good, leaves your hair very soft, and it's only $5 in store, so you can probably get it in bulk for cheaper.Don't be fooled though, true organic argan oil is very expensive, to the tune of $30 per 2oz"
4,Excellent,"Excellent -- it is just as described. It is not sticky, does not have a strong smell, but at the same time, it moisturizes very well and my super-dry skin felt very comfortable during winter time, when the heating in my house drys up my skin."
5,Excellent for Dry Itchy Scalp!!,"I've been using this product for approximately one month. As a result, I no longer have any scalp itch or dryness. After I wash or co-wash my hair, I put in a leave-in conditioner and then massage a small amount of the jojoba oil into my scalp. Not only are my coils soft and shinny all day long, my scalp has never felt better!"
5,Great product,"After reading some materials on jojoba oil, I finally ordered it for extremely dry and dull hair. The articles specifically said to add to either shampoo and/or conditioner if you want to (I added it to both). It's been about 2 weeks now and my hair is better than what it was before. I think it'll take longer for me to have soft, shiny hair since it's horribly dry to begin with. I am East Indian with thick and heavy hair which I've neglected for a long while."
4,Love this product!,"I was buying the expensive facial oils and mixing it in with my facial lotions for sometime now, but always had sticker shock when it came to buying a tiny little bottle of Suki oil for $30.00 bucks. So I thought I would give this a try and let me tell you this is just as good. In fact I went and looked at the ingredients on my expensive bottles of oil and 4 out 5 had Jojoba as one of its main ingredients. I have extremely dry skin and this leaves my face feeling moisturized and not greasy."
4,Versatile Beauty Oil,"This is a great all around beauty oil product. i use it for my skin, face, and hair. It needs to be used in moderation. I have acne prone skin and so far it has not caused any problems in fact it calms my skin beacuse i use a lot of other harsh products. very nice product."
5,Serving the Purpose,I ordered this product to make an oil blend to use on my hair. I have heard nothing but great things about this oil. It was very expensive. There is no real smell to it for those who are looking for a product like that.
5,Love It,It arrived fast and carefully wrapped. This is great for homemade scrubs or lotions. The price for this is cheaper than any health food store in my area.
5,hand softness,I use this oil on my hands during the cold weather. As long as I'm faithful to use it at least twice a day I don't have the skin cracking and bleeding that I typically had all winter. What a relief. I even keep some at work.
5,Jojoba oil is good for your hair,"herd great reviews on it ,purchased it and feel like it is working for my hair ,it is light and not too heavy like some oils,mixed it with castor oil also"
4,Good oil for natural hair,"I primarily bought this oil based upon the reviews for those who used it on their hair. I wear my hair natural ""curly girl"" and wanted some extra oil and softness to my hair. This worked well for me and I soon discovered that it doesn't take much either. I also used this in my bath water along with my bubbles and just a teaspoon in the water. Worked like a dream. I used this in combination with my lotion and again, it left my skin smooth and soft. I highly recommend to anyone for their hair or body as this oil is 100 percent natural, unlike some other oils I have tried."
5,Fluffy Hair,"I have been avoiding petroleum, mineral oil, and lanolin oil, but admit I was missing having soft hair. I did not exactly obey instructions. What I did instead was use the oil prior to drying my hair and was surprised how soft my hair became. It does just as it says. I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to anyone with dry hair. It will be a staple in my hair care from now on."
5,Great Oil,"I use this oil for my hair and skin concoctions. I like it because it is light and doesn't have a strong scent (barely any scent). I have noticed some hair growth, but I swtiched to coconut oil for my hair. I will still use this on my skin."
4,"Makes my skin so smooth, but smells like vegetable oil all day","I use this product for my very dry skin. I simply pour it in my palm and apply it to my body. The oil quickly soaks into my skin and makes my skin smooth like a baby, however, it does makes me smell like vegetable oil all day. I thougth the smell will quickly go away, but it doesn't. So, my solution is to add a drop of lavander or lemongrass oil to cover up the vegetable oil smell. Overall, I really like this brand of jojoba oil, becasue it is not greasy and it really moisturizes my skin."
4,An OK item,It smelled a bit funny kinda earthy like grape seeds. Its not super refined but works great and the smell goes away rapidly.
4,Good oil,Light oil that Works well on my hair & skin. My hubby & kids love using this oil on their scalp. It also shipped very quickly. I received my order in less than 10 days.
1,Allergy,"I wish I could love this product , but I can not . This product made my scalp irritated . It also gave me scabs and dry patches ."
3,Plastic Bottle - Not Glass,"If you are buying jojoba oil, you are aware of the benefits. My problem with this brand is that the bottle is plastic, not glass. The people who grow the jojoba bean expressly recommend that the jojoba oil should be stored in glass, never plastic. I returned this item immediately and without problem to Amazon. My only complaint was nowhere in the product description was the jojoba container identified as either glass or plastic. A waste of time and the return shipping fees. Oh well."
2,Dissapointed,"It is 1 oz not ten, as it looked to me. In my opinion, for what i got, it was really too expensive. I got two, and in my line of work, for $13.40 Two ounces is not a lot at all."
1,Beware if you have sensitive skin!,"I tried jojoba oil for a few days. The first day I noticed a very slight itchy feel to a few places on my skin, but didn't think much of it. The next day a few itchy bumps began on one arm. I stopped using the oil immediately, but by the next day I had more red, blistery bumps on both my arms. They itched like crazy! It has been 4 days and I still have this intensly itchy rash and am trying to control it with hydrocortisone cream and benadryl. I would not recommend jojoba oil to anyone with sensitive skin."
5,Truly Amazing! Miracle Product!,"I am 31 & have had trouble skin all of my life. Excema, severe acne, rashes, blotchiness, redness, sensitivity, uneven tone, blackheads, large pores, dry patches, hormonal breakouts, cystic acne, you name it I have it!I have tried everything! Prescription, pills, creams, gels, cleansers, toners, scrubs, lotions, OTC, department store, beauty store, Avon, Mary Kay & nothing has helped!That is until JOJOBA OIL! Now my skin is smooth, even, beautiful & with NO breakouts or problems! It is amazing that no doctor, dermatologist or website has suggested this miracle product.One of the best things is that it is natural with no side effects!Please try, you won't be sorry!"
5,I swear by this product!,"As someone with acne prone skin, the use of harsh salicylic acid-containing products causes my skin to become very dry, especially during the winter. Jojoba oil alleviates that problem while simultaneously clearing my complexion (far more than any moisturizer has ever done for my skin). If you have problems with dry yet blemish-prone skin, I'd absolutely recommend purchasing this product."
1,Do not get in plastic bottles!,"Jojoba oil is awesome stuff, but do not buy it in plastic bottles. Personal care products are a major source of phthalates, which are endocrine disruptors, and can help promote thyroid problems, diabetes, etc. Phthalates are in plastics, and phthalates leach into oils. Any jojoba oil in a plastic bottle will be choke full of phthalates. Buy Jojoba in glass containers. La Ronna is a good source for this."
5,Thank Jojoba,"I have to reorder this . I use a cocktail of oils argan, jojoba, olive oil, sweet almond oil, and to complete it is MONOI..... Must have to reduce wrinkles"
4,Works for skin but not for hair,"Although I first bought this product for hair use, I end up using it on my skin. I add some onto my shampoo and conditioner since my hairs are a little dry and thin, but I notice it make my scalp and hairs too greasy. Then I started to use it as hand and foot lotion and it works much better than most of the lotions."
5,Seems to work fine.,I don't like pills so bought this to spray on my legs when I have leg cramps. Seems to work good! Absorbs quickly with no greasy residue.
5,jojoba oil,"I purchased this product and combine it with castor oil, avocado oil, and coconut oil for my natural hair. My hair is healthy, manageable and has a nice shine."
5,"I love it, it works!",It is great for hair. I am not loosing my hair like before. They actually grow. I use it on my scalp and hair as a musk. About 24 hours before I wash my hair.
5,Amazing Product!!!,I haven't used it on my hair but I have used it on my skin and it was beautiful!!!! I will be putting this in my hair for hot oil treatment in feb. Right now I have my hair breaded up because it is so cold trying to protect my ends from drying.
5,Nice,It does its job for my hair- nice sealant.I mixed it with other carrier oils and it works just fine.
1,Too much hype,"I don't think this stuff did anything but break me out.It doesn't smell, but it is very greasy for facial use.It was recommended to help oily skin, but it did nothing for mine.I returned both bottles that I ordered."
1,This BS dries your skin waaay out after 35 minutes,This is another useless product. It feels like it works well when you first apply it. Give it 30 min and you'll see it doesn't. MISLEADING PRODUCT
3,"Verdicts still out, give me a couple more weeks","Not SURE about this one, yet. However, I'm sticking to it because of all the rave reviews. It doesn't seem to moisturize that well, and I think I may be breaking out because of it. Not sure, though, because I break out quite a bit. I'll get back to you."
1,Burns your scalp,"Do NOT let this touch your scalp! This happened to me and it burned and left 2 angry boils on my scalp, and every time I would turn over on the side that has them when sleeping, I would go ""OW!"". lol, but that's how much they hurt... (this says it can use on the skin)I really don't see how this makes the hair moist either, AND I had this for a while. The only reason I bought it is to put in the leave-in conditioner from Kimmaytube on Youtube. I will try another brand and see how it goes."
5,Great for skin,"Love this product! Will say that I mix it with a little almond oil (also from Now) about a 4 to 1 part mix. Have had someone that was doing my nail's tell me (Oh my gosh your hand's are soft!) I use the mixture after sunning and it really help's keep the skin soft and healthy. Did try it with my shampoo and it was ok, but my hair dont really need the oil. But my skin does. I also use it on my face and have noticed more softer skin with a natural glow. I say to anyone that has dry skin, try this product!"
1,Get the Full version,There is an import version out there that has all the original 16 tracks. I agree with the other reviewer that the missing tracks are the better tracks. Skip this version and search out the full CD.
2,missing tracks!,"Why on earth did they release this version with so many tracks chopped off? No excuse for a CD compliation to have less than the number of tracks that the original CD had, which in this case was 16 mind-blowing slabs of sonic perfection. Get the full 16-track version. My copy is a Canadian import CD on the Nettwerk. Capitol label."
1,Lies and the Lying Liars who write them,"Its so amazing to see authors who pick up pens to write about people after their death. If raja anwar was so convinced by his ""truth"" why did he wait till Bhutto's death to write a book about him? Was it because he was afraid their would be someone who would point out that everything in his - using the term very loosely- book is totally false? Anwar is a coward who should have taken at the very least a crash course in the art of writing before he sold himself out as an author."
1,Over Priced Waist of time,"I am an avid Texas Hold'em tournament pro poker player and reader of poker books.I have read the book in short save your money, only took me 2 hours. Texas Hold'em is game that you need to get started with the correct tools this book is not one of them.Buy books written by the pro's Tom McEvoy: Dan Harrington: Doyle Brunson or Ken Warren all are world champions and will get you started in the right direction."
2,It's Basic...,Short read and fairly basic for conservative players...Here's what it comes down too:The people that gives it 4-5 stars are generally internetplayers or usually play with their friends at house gamesonce a week...they have never stepped into a Casinopoker room...I'll tell you the secret to winning an online game...unlessyou just wanna have fun...just sit on your butt and playonly high cards...you will win consistenly...trust me...The people that gives it low ratings have read alot ofpoker books and been grinding at actual cash tables orplayed in multiple tourneys...They know what it's all about...sure you can playconservative sometime but there are alot of otherfactors to winning in poker...especially at No LimitHoldem...Get yourself Harrington's Vol 2...it's a much betterread and teachs you some advance concepts...I could always spot and internet player at acash or tournament live game...it's fairly easyto make money off them...
3,Positives & Negatives,"I cant help but chuckle at the total mix of reviews on this book, from absolute hate to absolute love. I was somewhere in the middle. I thought the book was too short, and did not go in depth in all details of the game. However, I thought the book actually had some original thought, new ideas, and creativity. I liked the hand selection, and the mythology discussion. Some of the situational stuff was also useful...overall...I would not say this is the best poker book ever, but it is definetly not the worst, I would recommend it."
4,Excellent Strategy for Large No Limit Hold'em Tournaments,"I absolutely enjoyed this book. It was simple in strategy, but very thoughtful in its direction and approach. Playing the sit'n'go and the small 20-30 players tournaments is very much a game of maneuvering, limping in, and being aggressive early. This book is very much focused on large 500+ player tournaments where you will get killed a quick death if you limp in every second hand. Poker is boring. I have played it for 10 years and if you play it well, you will get bored 95% of the time. This is what I love about this book, sound fundamentally, and forces you to think about appropriate hand selection prior to getting involved in a hand. I would have liked more insight on post flop strategy if you miss your hand. I loved the soft strategy aspects of the book. Overall, quick interesting read. I recommend it."
1,Fine line between funny and stupid,"When I read the list of authors parodied, I couldn't wait to dive into this book. I've read a majority of the originals and always enjoy a good parody. Unfortunately, this book wasn't it. Sometimes there's a fine line between funny and stupid - but this book never gets close to that line; it stays well over on the stupid side. Miller did manage to capture the style of the originals, but the attempts at parodies were senseless and void of humor. Don't waste your money; don't waste your time. If you're faced with getting a root canal or reading this book, go to the dentist; you'll enjoy it more."
5,A brilliant group,"It makes a nice background music??? Not at all. Totally wrong! This is one of Morri's best affords. Interplay with Mat Meneri leaves you breathless. Underthru is in a more lighter mood that the gem ""A Cloud Of Black Birds"". There are more catchy themes and there's more groove in it. A good place to start with Joe Morris and a highlight band! Highly recommended!"
4,good but freezes at times,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. He really likes it, but it freezes at times. Other than that, it seems to play quite well."
5,Wonderful Movie,"This is a wonderful movie for anyone going through cancer, or any other serious trial in life. As for the seller, I would highly recommend them to anyone. It was nice doing business with them."
4,Decent Movie,"Good Movie for any cancer survivors, Ken Curtis Shows You How To Live By Faith In The Lord Using Psalm 23, As His Guide."
1,range kleen large under sink storage,"This is too flimsy. It might hold toilet paper with no problem, but I returned it."
2,Red Wallet Review,"I found the wallet to be cheap looking and MUCH smaller than the picture lead me to believe. To call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product. This is more of an insert to a wallet, consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket. I wasn't pleased with the purchased, expecting quite a bit more the $14 I spent. I can go to Target and get a wallet for less that what I paid for this one and it will be a FULL wallet, not a sorry wannabe."
4,good stuff,This is a great high protein food for the $ spent. Most high protein formulas are twice this much. My dog loves it.
5,Well my dogs love it,My overweight dog started to lose some weight and my skinny one put on a few pounds. Had to switch food again since I have one who just developed allergies. They do not like that one near as much.
2,Didn't work for my dog.....,"My dog ate nothing but this food for 3 months. I gave him the recommended amount and everything. Not only didn't he lose weight, he gained 6 pounds!!! Not worth the money or the trouble although he loved the way it tasted. Smells very strong because it has salmon in it."
2,"Fair interpretation, bad sound.","Dohnanyi's recording of these masterpieces is straightforwardand unobstrusive.He is a little slow and heavyhanded in the 1.movement of nr.8,and rather measured in movement 2, but this is serious music. The same goes for the first movement in nr.9 in a minor degree.Movement 3 is easygoing, but mildly tampering.The two last allegro movements are quicker and wellsprung.But what about the sound?The sound is closed in and wrapped in cotton,at least on mystereorig.What is this Telarc?Go to Sir John Barbirolli with the Wiener Phil. in the Emirecording from 1966. Hear how the sound picture opens up andthe climaxes come through effortlessly."
1,Didn't play!,It would start playing then the picture would stop but the music played the stoped and that's why I didn't like it and I want my money back and to see the movie
4,Returned,"Well, i liked it but my daughter did not and we returned it. I'm hoping to see my credit come thru soon. Can you let me know if you rec'd the watch back or not? Thanks"
3,"Maybe, maybe not","Not sure this product is helping with joint inflammation, but it seems to be making the skin more vibrant. Will continue to take for a while unless becomes too expensive."
1,"A ""Rag"" of a book, unfortunately","This is, unfortunately, one of the most poorly researched works on the subject. How can anyone write about carrier warfare without reference to a single American or Japanese work on the subject? The author has relied exclusively on British sources, and old, sometimes inaccurate ones, at that. Too bad. The style is good, but the whole book is superficial and includes a number of factual errors (e.g. it is ""Regia Marina"", not ""Regia Navale""). There are much more valuable works, especially in the same price range, than this one."
5,A luminous movie,"This work is like encountering a strange film which, after a while seems not to be a film at all but an experience you are having, a kind of a journey that you don't remember setting out on. It takes you through England, Bali, Cambodia, Italy, through time, through light. In the end, as with all good journeys, you are someplace else and you are a little different, though in ways you can't describe. That's what is so great about this book; it takes you someplace in a way that lies outside summation."
3,decent - a bite off of MONSTER though,"this book was severely creepy. it really freaked me out. bleah. anyway, from the beginning it totally struck me as a repeat of C.P.'s earlier book, Monster,"" and it sort of upset me that he was essentially revamping an old story to create a new one. granted this one is different enough to merit being a book, but the difference is hardly distinct. Whatever, it was decent, i didn't like it that much, and is it just me or has his characterization gotten a little sloppy? i felt that he was starting to recycle a certain formula. BUt dang, this was still a creepy book."
4,"Okay, better than last few but he's done a lot better.","I've been a Pike fan for a long time. I think, and I have to agree with the other commentary but its impossible to create one masterpiece after another . . he's running out of ideas. He's been spiraling down especially after the Last Vampire series . . with Star Group in particular. . I thought that was really, really bad. But Hollow Skull is still decent and its a lot better than most of his recent work, its pretty good. An entertaining novel, with neat twists and an interesting plot. . I just found it a little confusing. I don't know if its because I'm getting older, or because he's losing his touch but I'm slowly getting tired of Pike. . .I hope his future pieces of work will change my mind."
3,a bit too depressing,"I liked it fairly enough, but i HATED the ending! I guess that I'm just one of those people who likes happy endings. That whole doomed Earth thing is just too much."
3,"Hey, it's still C.Pike","The Hollow Skull is in the most part typical Pike. He has the amazing ability to complement two contrasting notions. Horror and religion. While THS has the thrilling ""Pike touch"" of intense, uncomplicated, mystery and horror underline with enlightening and spiritual ideas, it lacks originality in comparison with his other books. The book runs too smoothly, reads too well. However, the ending is absolutely, almost ridiculously Pike. Because of it, the book is still a must have for all CPIKE fans. Although, absent the little quirks and twists, substantiation, and thought provoking nuances, which makes his other novels riveting, The Hollow Skull is just another teen horror thriller."
4,This is a good book but not Pike's best,"I really like this book. It was sort of like the invasion of the body snatchers revisited, but there is a heroine who you really grow to like. The ending of this book has a wonderful Christopher Pike twist."
3,"Not a best seller, but it makes you think!","""The Hollow Skull,"" is a interesting story. Although not a bestseller, I believe it has great potential for a sequel. The plot is extremly confusing, but I think that is part of what makes the story intersting as well as its fusturistic science. I would recomed this book to other readers."
5,Some friendly advice...,People are less inclined to cut off each other's heads when trees are around.
3,Not very satisfied,Treats very good topics in an obscure manner and the chapter numbering is inconveneient in addition to being slightly unusual.
1,Not Useful for the Practicing Engineer,"This was one of two text books used by a professor of mine in a wireless communications class. Content-wise, this book is not useful to anyone interested in really learning how wireless comm systems work. There is way too much theorey and mathematical proofs in this book and not enough hands on material for the practicing engineer. Our class found numerous typos in the book too. The Wireless Communications book by Rappaport is more useful."
5,"Good book, precise, complete!.","Good book. Dr. Stuber was my teacher at Georgia Tech. At that time we were using Proakis book (Digital Comm.), yet, I always went back to this concise book for precise information on those confuse subjects like adaptive filtering. It's full of formulas and theory; it covers adaptive filtering including MLSE, Viterbi, and algorithm like the Steepest Descent or the practical MLS. It is not a Filtering book, yet it does covers the essentials. It covers Modulation and Demodulation, Detection, Estimation, Fading channels etc etc. It is a good reference book writing by a pioneer in the field. I do recommend this great book for a complete engineer's library. In fact I have just purchase the new edition. Thank you Dr. Stuber."
1,A phone should have ONE function,"I'm sick of phones having cameras, mp3 players, etc. I need to be able to hear a person on the other end and have them hear me. THIS phone has major problems, and only after going crazy for 5 months am I finding out it's this model that's the problem, not my service carrier or anything other issue. The service carrier was of no help solving the problem of constantly losing calls without them actually being dropped. So, I purchased a different phone with good reviews for it's call clarity and lack of bells and whistles...and don't you know, I can actually conduct business via phone now.This phone doesn't have an mp3 player, but does have a camera. The camera takes terrible, grainy photos. So if that's important to you, pass on this phone as well.The positive, is that this is the first phone that I've had that I could hear the ""ringer."" Unlike the other woman's opinion of it's low ringer; on the top volume, it's quite loud when indoors."
4,Very true to the actual events,"I was one of the lawyers for the plaintiff in the lawsuit. I saw the movie several years after the trial, and found it to be an accurate depiction of the facts and events that took place. An amazing story and very tragic."
1,Fred Astaire Collection without Fred Astaire,"I was excited to see the song ""By Myself"" included on this CD.It was the reason I made the purchase. Well, I sent it back.There are no vocals on it at all! Perhaps I misunderstood the description of the CD, so I assume others might do the same thing. If you want to hear Fred Astaire, you won't listen to him here!"
2,comes with problems,The machine has some plastic parts that can't be replaced but break very easily. I would advise anyone who wants one to look for a machine that is made of all metal parts...common complaints include the beakage of main assembly components.Not happy with this purchase but I'm educated now...no reflection on the seller or amazon
5,Spectacular shots!,"I did a lot of research before I decided to purchase the SP-310. I'm so happy with my choice. I still have a long way to go before I figure out all the menus and options, but trust me, you can get some really fantastic photos when just using the automatic functions. The best feature on this camera is the super macro mode. I spent a few hours at our local public gardens and ended up taking well over 150 photos - most of which were closeups of the inside of blossoms. Even the pollen was clear and in focus. The detail was incredible. Plus, the lithium batteries that came with the camera are still kicking.I took a very basic photography course a few years ago and have dreamt of owning an SLR camera ever since. With the option of automatic or full manual control, plus the amazing super macro feature, who needs SLR? I recommend this camera to any amateur photographer."
2,Poor battery life,"The camera has a complete feature list and good image quality. Unfortunately, battery life is so bad it's almost useless. I rarely get more than 25 shots from a set of freshly charged AA rechargables.I sent the camera to Olympus to have the firmware updated, but it didn't make any discernible difference."
3,What Battery Problem?,"I keep seeing reviews complaining about the battery life with this camera. I always used the lithium AA batteries by Ever Ready. I get 150+ shots with them. Otherwise, being 2009, I'd look elswhere at this point. A nice camera but you can find so much more at this price now. This is why I only gave 3 stars."
4,Good camera,"The only flaw in this camera is the hook for the battery compartment. It is fairly small and plastic, and it takes very little to make it useless.However, with that said.. the sliding action of the battery compartment cover still keeps the battery in and functioning.I was very pleased with the quality & relative simplicity of this camera, excepting the flaw noted above."
2,This camera is junk,"Barely after 1 year of ligt use, the lens got stuck (closed) one fine morning after replacing batteries. The lens won't come out. Kept displaying ""Zoom Error"" and auto-shutting-off. I gave it a real good whack and voila.Stick with other brand names... I heard good comments about Olympus. Personally I will never go for anything other than Canon or Nikon in future."
1,Who's fooling who?,Elevator music... Too bad this form didn't let me enter a zero. You won't hear Carlos Santana's powerful guitar anywhere on this album. The cd's deception carries over even into the liner notes which only talks about Santana. No where is there a mention of the alternative artists used to create this album. I guess it really was my fault since it states on the front that all songs were created by the Latin Sound of Guitars. I will in the future put Big Eye Misic on my Don't Buy list.
1,Who needs this?,Who would want to listen to somebody playing Santana music when you can listen to The Man himself?
3,"Good for learning, but not inspirational","This chord finding guide is for up and coming guitarist who want to learn as many chords as possible. There are over 1,116 chords in all. If you are a beginner/enthusiast then this concise book will steer you in the right direction.Enjoy!!!!!!!"
2,Not happy!,"Received camera for a gift. Dropped camera two months later. Camera was damage so easy. The lens was stuck and would not retract. Cost to repair $$$, was not worth having it repaired. I think I will try a Cannon this time."
1,Lasted less than 6 months ...,"This camera is fine--at first. I got a few months' use from it after paying nearly full MSRP. The zoom feature stopped working, and within a few days, the zoom lens would no longer retract. It's also a battery eater. If I could have another one for free, I'd pass."
2,Buy another...,"The fact that this camera ""eats"" batteries shouldn't be underestimated. For example, if you plan on taking several photo's while on vacation, plan on burning through AT LEAST 2 batteries per day, and that assumes that you turn off the camera between shots. The picture quality is OK, but within 1 year (11 months to be exact), the ""low battery"" light kept coming on no matter how many times we changed them out. Customer service suggested that we should put new batteries in ... again. After I explained that this is the 4th set of batteries and the low battery light is still on, they would not be deterred. It's my fault, not the cameras. Gee, thanks Olympus. Won't buy another (this is my 2nd) and you can definitely get your money's worth with other brands (see other reviews on this page). Very disappointing."
5,Solid camera,"I had this camera for several years and it has worked great! It's only a 5MP camera, but for most jobs that is plenty (so why spend $$$ on a camera in my opinion). The only catch is that it works best with lithium batteries. Solid camera!"
3,Pretty good for the price,"there is a bit of a lag between when you push down the button and when the shutter actually goes off. even if you pre-setup the photo by pushing down the button half way, there is still maybe a 1/4 to 1/2 second delay.I bought this camera for my brother and have used my in-laws and I guess you could get used to it. I own an olymput c770 and it does not have this issue.but for the price, it works fine."
4,good book,"I bought this book because it was a textbook for packagedesign class. Easy to read, nice photographs but littlebit expensive."
3,Garlic tablets *might* not be digested by your stomach...,"But my wife noticed several weeks ago that my breath was smelling more and more like garlic... and now I am looking for other alternatives to the Garlicin product. I do the Tim Ferris PAGG regimen ,so there is a slight chance that it might be either the Green Tea or Alpha Lineoleic Acids, but neither of them smell like Garlic, and I only take the P at night.Great program by the way... Tim is unusual, but his stuff taken in moderation has worked tremendously for me.Final editorial note. I travel a lot. Usually 2-3 weeks a month on planes. Long haul... I also have two children and both my wife and kids have been sick a couple of times in the last few months. I haven't been. Tim doesn't claim that this stuff makes you immune to illness, but it certainly seems to me like it does. (I have no financial interest in any of these products or people)"
1,What's good for the goose . . .,"As a former student of Wendell Fountain's I expected so much more from this publication, as he expects of his students. His intentions appear to be good, however, good intentions are not good enough. For $35.00, I expected more than repetition, and expected to see graphs, charts and management/director info not glossed over in the, ""we know this, and don't have to expound"" language used by too many so-called writers, experts with the been there and done that attitude."
4,Great Home Office Spacesaver!,"We bought one of these 5 months ago and love all we can do with it! It is small, but it heats single servings, grills sandwiches, and will do both at once. We keep it in our home office for snacks and for warm-ups--compact and efficient for those things.The only flaw is that the coffee pot drips almost as much as it pours."
2,Received this item for Christmas,"The coffee pot leaks when pouring. The filter part is very poorly designed, you have to be sure to ""lock"" it into place or the coffee will run out the sides. The top is flimsy. I like the warming trays but, i wish the tray could be moved up or down."
2,A sound idea ruined !,"If you look at the idea of an alien invasion of Earth and then having a number of endings, the concept sounds good. However the author isn't up to telling the tale. At page twenty I was ready to put this book aside. The relationship between the scientist couple is poor. Dialogue spoken between these two made me cringe. Yes there are multiple positive and negative endings. By the time I got to them I had given up."
4,Froggy Frenzy,"Gave this to my one year old grandson at Christmas. He loves it and has a great time listening to the sounds, as well as putting the bugs in the frogs mouth and pulling them out of the frog's belly.Excellent hands on toy for toddlers which lends itself to more sophisticated learning as your child progresses."
3,Frog lover!!!,"I love this toy. It is simple and cute but as far as the price is concerned it is WAY OVER PRICED!!!! I paid $40 for it and even though I love it, it isn't worth the price. Also, my 9 month old hasn't shown much interest in it. It is well made and very cute but save your money and purchase something else unless you can find this for a lower price then I would recommend it.Sincerely,Kathy (mom of a 7 year old and a 9 month old)"
4,Alligator Bath Toy,"Cute and my kid likes to play with it. She especially likes how the fish squirt water when you squeeze them. I don't know what another reviewer is talking about the alligator burping....? Ours does not and doesn't look like it's even supposed to.It does take a long time to try and that makes me worry it might mold eventually. However, bath toys aren't meant to be kept forever."
3,"Small, portable, not leak-proof.","The container is OK for small items, or if you want to keep a large cup of coffee hot (with the heating pad). The lid seals tight, but the vented cover sometimes leaks if you tip it sideways. This is a problem if you fill it with soup and carry it to work. This also does not hold a package of ramen comfortably; I have to break up the noodles to fit it all, then there is little space for broth. If it were a little bigger, I might rate it higher."
2,Too small!,"I don't know if this item is for kid's lunch or what. The bag itself is small, and the mug is even smaller! Frankly speaking, I can't think of any use of it with this size, except maybe put in coffee. But then why bother using this mug? A regular mug can be much more convenient to hold. Anyway, I just returned it. Regardless how much it costs, it has to be at least useful!!"
1,one of the most frustrating purchases ever,"I took it to Portland Oregon and the device was worse than worthless. Example: it said I was 500 feet from my destination, then I turned into a parking lot and then it said I was 8 miles from my destination. Another example: I was headed to the airport and following the instructions. It said I was 20 minutes away; then it said, ""re-calculating route"" and I was 38 minutes away. I had to stop at a gas station and get directions. At least 10 times I was following the instructions and then it says `recalculating route"". I have more examples, but you get the idea. I bought it online and realized how bad it was after the return policy expired and so I tried to return it to Garmin, but they wouldn't take it. I didn't want to sell it because it works so badly, so I gave it to goodwill and wrote on the box that it is a `toy'. Do yourself a favor and buy something better."
3,Garmin Quest,"Although I am familiar with this product and was quite happy with it, some jerk stole it out of my car. I ordered a new one from Amazon and after a good solid month of trying to get it to work, the help people at Garmin (who were great) and I, finally figured out I had a defective unit. I returned it to Amazon who then gave me some trouble with a full refund etc., even though the unit was defective. Frustrating!! There are newer units out now that have a touch screen interface which makes them easier to use - at an increase in price though. Overall, Amazon eventually was reasonable."
2,My Garmin Quest just died,"We bought our Quest last Dec and it's only four months old. One day about three weeks ago while in use, it simply went dead. Searched Garmin FAQs with no joy. Tried Technical Support by phone about five times - each time it announced a minimum 30 min wait time. Tried online Technical Support but it was a 5-7 day turn around. After a week and a half, they finally emailed us a RMA for sending our Quest to Garmin for service. No idea how much longer that will take.Bottom line is that the Quest was wonderful while it was working. If it stops working, don't expect any speedy response from Garmin. My dealing with Garmin over the past three weeks has angered me to the point that I will never buy another Garmin product!"
4,"Great, Not Perfect","My Garmin Quest is quick and easy to use. It is a copilot who reads reasonably current maps, gives directions quickly and clearly, never takes offense at my arbitrary course changes, and pops into my pocket when I change cars. Okay, this copilot does seem to consult an outdated list of local services when I ask where I might stop for lunch. And, it does seem to favor main roads with high traffic volumes and slow traffic lights. But, I don't expect my copilot to do everything."
4,"Top notch product, but a bit hard to learn","I've had my Quest for 3 months now and it works exactly as it says. My problem is that it is difficult for an old, computer-illiterate person like me to figure out exactly how to work it. My husband refuses to touch it saying it's impossible to figure out. I have to pull out the book every time I use it. It's probably unfair to give it a 4 -The user should get a 1...therefore if anyone is sitting in their rocking chair on the porch, getting ready to take their 1965 Malibou Convertible out of the garage for a drive...Know you will need to get the instruction book and the computer (to load the particular State's maps); it doesn't hold much and you have to delete and re-put..and I forget how to do it each time...but it works great once you get it set up for your trip.."
4,Nice Little Product,"For the money this little GPS works really well for me in the mid-West and West Coast (Seattle and LA areas)- and I still have room left to store a couple of other areas. Directions and voice prompts work as well as the Hertz Neverlost systems I had been renting. The screen is a bit small but is easy enough to see and reference while driving. GPS signal acquisition is reasonably quick when moving between regions particularly if you start using the manuallocation feature - the automatic mode does take a bit longer. While I like the compact size for travel, the snap-in mount / external speaker is a bit clunky to carry and can be difficult to extract the unit from. I would also point out that according to the Garmin web-site, the windshield suction mount provided is not legal for use in California - oh well."
2,Lasted 17 Months...now what?,"Well, I enjoyed this unit while it lasted. Now it works for a few minutes before it eternally says ""Lost Satellite Reception"". Since Garmin charges $150 to repair it, I'll be getting a new one. This shouldn't have happened. I only use it a few times per month!Shoulda gotten the extended warranty!"
1,MAPS HOPELESSLY OUTDATED MAKE THIS USELESS!,I have had a quest for about 6 months now and find this a very frustrating unit to work with.Recently went on a trip to California from Arizona and all went well until I got to California. Although I had maps loaded for the location I went to (Sacramento) the maps were outdate by as much as 2 yrs.Here in Arizona where I live south of Phoenix there have been a lot of new developments and there's a loop that's been completed and in existence for about a year and a half and it doesn't show on the map.Garmin will go to great lenghts to ask you to report the issue but will not do anything to resolve it.This is pretty much useless as the area I drive around has been much developed but there are no street or road displays anywhere on the most current version of the map.FORGET GARMIN!RUN AWAY from this product unless you want to be frustrated out of your mind.
4,Garmin Quest GPS Navigator,"This is an excellent product and meets the expectations set by Garmin's advertising. The only glitch that I noted was that the ""add-on"" North American city map and POI information was furnished in DVD and not CD format. Former units were shipped with a three-disc CD (which most computers are equipped to handle). I had a problem with not being able to find a computer that could read the DVD that was sent with the unit. Garmin's tech support was very helpful and furnished me with codes that allowed me to download city maps from a friends CD set. You will almost surely be satisfied with this product. It is a lot of fun and a real help in unfamiliar locations. Just beware that you will need access to a computer with the capacity to read DVD discs."
3,"Nice Product, But Garmin has TERRIBLE Customer Service","I have a problem with mine, and I have tried to call their CS line 6 times, and all 6 times I was put on hold for over 45 minutes. I finally gave up. In fact, once I left the room, and came back 90 minutes later, and I was still on hold.I also e-mailed them and got zero response."
2,GOOD FOR THE PRICE BUT YOU CAN BUY BETTER,"I was looking fo an affordable GPS for my car service, It is a important tool for my job and it is something I really depend on, The Quest has served me well, so far but as I need to move forward, I will leave the Quest behind, here are the reasons.NO TOUCHSCREEN is a problem, especialy when you need to type an adress fast, it is very hard to use the key pad.LOW CAPACITY means if you are making a long trip chances are you wont be able to use it, beacause it won't fit the entire maps on thereLOOSES SATTELITE more than normal and sometimes it takes an eternity to recover, by then you maybe lost.MY RECOMMENDATION- something with preloaded maps of at least the US, touchscreen is easier to use, and something with a fast processor for fast re-routing."
4,Practical and Affordablebut yet very Portable GPS,"Practical and AffordableI purchased this unit after lengthy research.I took it with me while driving across 6 states and loaded the maps of my route spanning 5 states.This unit showed me all that am required for someone unknown to the area. I could trust it with all my heart after my trip across the country driving through Indiana, Ohio, NJ, and New York.I was able to easily switch it to my friend' car and then carry it with me in side my house.You could buy this unit if:1> you do not mind loading maps of area as and when you need it.2> Like to have portability compared to full scale features."
1,what apiece of junk,"Owned it for 3 months. Now it can't find sattellites. I rebooted it, changed it to the previuos software, deleted all maps from it. It still can't find the sattellites. So no navigation! To top it all off, Egghead(Amazon) does't remember my order, so I CAN'T GET AN rma TO RETURN IT.Again do not buy this product!!!!!!"
2,A bit wordy!,"I bought this as part of a four book purchase including ""Getting Started in Garden Railroading: Build the Railroad of Your Dreams... in Your Own Backyard"" by Allan Miller (5 stars),Gorgeous Garden Railways"" by Marc Horovitz and Pat Hayward (4 starts), and ""Garden Railroading: Getting Started in the Hobby"" by Garden Railways Magazine (4 stars).This book just wasn't for me unfortunately. Perhaps it was too wordy for my humble mind but I felt it tried to cover too much and didn't get into enough detail on anything. Also for a US based garden railroader the emphasis was more on the UK scene and I think was aimed at more ""advanced"" railroaders such as those using live steam."
2,Too dark for young children,"I'm surprised by all the rave reviews this book has received here. True, the illustrations are beautiful. However, the story is about a series of events that culminates with a monkey killing a baby owl (with an illustration of the poor little owl getting clunked on the head), and then progresses with the mother owl's mourning period. My 3 year old and I both find it disturbing -- not exactly a good bedtime read."
3,"Good message, unexpected death","My 3 yr old son picked this book out from the library for his free book after completing his summer reading program. He wanted to read the book as soon as we got home, and I unfortunately didn't read it first. I was not expecting the baby owl to get killed in the story, and it's a big part of the plot line. I was not prepared to have a conversation about death with my son over a picture book. I did enjoy the book, and appreciate the message, but I was a little shocked by the content as the book seems geared towards younger children. I would recommend this book, but caution parents to make sure their children aren't overly sensitive to the subject matter."
4,An african tale,Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears is a humorous book from an West African Tale. This book takes you through parts of the rainforest and explores some of the animals that inhabit it. It is not hard to follow and teaches the purpose of communication between people. I think this is a great book for a child to learn the purpose of communication.
1,Too American!,Scribe has got to be the biggest clown ever. He's from New Zealand and he flows in an American accent?! Fool.
5,Excellent Vintage Television,"This is excellent television. I wish they had the who series on DVD. Buyers need to know that the shows on these two disks are from the later part of the series, after they moved out of the city. The older episodes are not represented in this small collection."
3,"A disappointing ""Goldbergs""","I ordered this DVD with great anticipation of renewing old and fond memories of a TV series of my childhood. The series primarily took place in a part of NYC not far where I grew up and I related to many of the characters in both my family and personal life. Sadly, both discs present episodes from what must be nearly the end of the run where the family was trying to assimilate and moved to the suburbs - kind of ""The Jeffersons"" in reverse. Most of the charm was gone, though it was nice to see the actors again. I wish the description of the contents would have made clear what was being presented. However, for the price, not much $$$ was wasted."
3,Goldberg's in the suburbs,"The stories are solid, the picture quality as you would expect it to be but good stories make up for it. I was disappointed that Molly and family are in the suburbs, not hanging out the window of the old neighborhood, so to me some of the flavor isn't there, but that was my disappointment and doesn't take away from the ups and downs of the Goldbergs."
2,No Mrs Bloom here,This is NOT the portion of the Goldbergs that made them famous. This was the series swan song. Its nice to see the old characters but they are NOT in the city and Mrs Bloom is NO where to be seen or heard from. Does anyone have the early episodes?
3,The Goldbergs......,"I was surprised to find that this wears rather well with time. It was as I remembered it, maybe even more current feeling, than I would have expected. A good piece of nostalgie to have in my collection of memories. And, entertaining for its time."
5,The Goldbergs,My whole family including 4 generations from teens to my 99 year old Mother thoroughly enjoyed this work from beginning to end.
2,Weak television series,"The radio series, which I used to follow, was far superior to this uninspired television series. The humor and the intelligence just aren't present. Sadly, even the low cost of the DVD is not worth it."
4,Just finished 5 minutes ago!,"This is a short, compact little book. Sarraute wrote it on the hinge of the century; the moderns had come & gone. Faced with the paradox that ""we can't re-do what Joyce, Woolf, Faulkner, Proust did, because that would clearly be perceived as copying innovators, but Tolstoy and Stendahl's traditional techniques are copied every day,"" Sarraute urges further innovation, up to and including the excision of the ""he said"" part of dialog. In doing so she explicates, to a certain degree, the processes that brought her to the unique style and technique evidenced in her novels."
2,Good information but recommended titles are out of print,"Dorothy Butler has good advice for parents about reading to their children at a very young age. However, as a reading specialist, I found it quite disheartening that she hasn't updated her booklist. Most of the titles on her recommended list are out of print. How are eager parents supposed to get their hands on books that are no longer available?"
2,Another Tool looking for an Application,"I bought one of these to get into tight spots. However the gear box is so large, it is no better at getting into tight areas than a regular hand drill. I've had for it 3+ years now and while I've attempted to use it several times, in the beginning because I thought it might work and of late, in hopes of justifying its purchase. I've not found an application where it helped. It's just too bulky. There are far less expensive alternatives on the market that are more useful. I now have one of them too. If you want one of these, I bet you can find a used one real cheap, in perfect, unused condition, at a pawn shop near you."
1,Works Great For a Day,"I bought this product thinking I was going to save some money by avoiding a right angle drill.It worked great for a day of drilling holes through joists, then the internal metal gears (the mechanism that makes this product work) started to strip. Now it won't even drill a hole through paper.****Update****I contacted customer service since the product has a two year warranty, I just emailed them, told them that I have a broken Orbiter and they sent me a new one just like that. No questions asked. The only problem is that the new orbiter is still in the box. By the time they sent me a new one, I had already bought a right angle drill."
1,Not for prime time,I too bought this tool to drill a few studs for electric wires in a remodel project. I got 9 studs drilled when it would only make noise and not turn. I was using a 3/4 inch spade bit and a 14.4v cordless drill.
3,"clever, but not heavy duty","I also bought this tool to drill wooden studs for electrical wires. I am using the orbiter 1300, a spade handle Dewalt drill, and an Irwin 3/4"" self advancing auger bit. With this set up, there is a sound (similar to the clutch slipping on a cordless drill) and the bit slows way down. I am not sure if this thing has a built in preset clutch to prevent it from snapping in two. Its probably fine for general light use and the ability to drill at nearly any angle is handy."
2,Am I reading Peretti or Rivers?,"Over-all it was a decent book...entertaining. I found myself wondering how much influence Frank Peretti's books and Francine River's book ""Atonement Child"" played in the development of this work. Also I found several contradictions throughout--even though they were minor. For example, a girl in a wheel chair giving her testimony in front of the church, and then ""sitting down when she was finished."" Again, minor details, but it still bothered me just a bit."
2,Really bad,This book is totally non-comprehensive and seems actually very sophomoric for a graduate course. The author gets lazy and decides she isn't going to cover some important topics b/c she doesn't feel like it. Some of the chapters are very introductory. This is seriously the worst book I've had in both my u-grad and grad career and I'm annoyed I had to pay for it. I'm totally selling this piece of junk after I'm through with my class.
1,more like a warming oven then toaster oven,I recieved this oven for Christmas. This is a sharp looking unit but VERY slow to toast just about anything. My husband prefers toaster slots and I like the oven rack - if they would both work - it could be a great unit. The interior is very small with a rack that can not be adjusted. I think I could toast bread faster with a flash light then with this oven. Not worth it.
1,This is the worst appliance I have ever bought,I bought this product less than 1 year ago and both the toaster and the toaster oven portions do not work. This is positively the worst product I have ever owned.
1,"Thought it was great, but not really.",Great idea but the toaster side broke within two months of purchase (only toasts on one side) and the toaster oven doesn't toast evenly (bottom is lighter).
1,YIKES,"I love the concept but in reality it needs some fine tuning. Both the toaster & the oven are extremely slow. Even on a low setting the toaster dries the bread before toasting it, which makes some very crunchy toast-not as bad as melba toast, but more like garlic toast.I coldn't get mine returned fast enough."
1,seemed like a good idea,"The space-saving is great, but like the other reviewer, the toaster never really worked well, and finally stopped functioning altogether. The toaster oven portion is uneven at best. I'm going back to two different appliances...."

5,Some of the most beautiful prayers I have ever known,"Virginia has a great depth of spirituality. This volume, her first, covers a portion of it. I am looking forward to having this book for many years, and know it will speak to me for a long time."
2,Poor optical quality,"Over the past 45 years, I have used many cameras from 11x14 and 4x5 view cameras through small point and shoot digital cameras.When I bought an SP-350 in 1986, I had high hopes for the SP-350 as a small RAW-capable compact camera. After comparing the SP-350 side by side with several other compact cameras, including a 5MP Kodak z730 and a very sharp 6MP Kodak z760, I immediately gave the SP-350 away even though it was then my only RAW-capable camera. I was VERY disappointed in the optical quality. I could not make a sharp 13x19 print, something that both consumer-oriented Kodak cameras could do with ease. (Actually, the 6MP Kodak z760 is capable of a decent 18x24"" print.)Do yourself a favor: Spend less money and get a more modern and effective S90 or G11 series Canon. The G11 Canon lens is much sharper and the sensor is better. The SP-350 is seriously out of date (it doesn't even have anti-shake stabilization) and it was not among the better cameras even when newly introduced."
2,Dissapointed,"After owning a few digital cameras, I decided to go with the Olympus SP350 mainly because of all the great reviews it's gotten. I have two small children and the most important feature that I look for in a digital camera is the shutter speed as I like to take lots of candid photos of my kids. I could not do that with the Olympus. Every time I got ready to take a photo the time for the shutter to go off was extremely slow thereby losing the chance to take a great picture. The battery life is quite limited. It would drain after taking several pictures. In summary, although the camera took nice photos it was just not the one for me and if you have young kids and like to take consecutive candid photos of them, I suggest that you spend a few hundred dollars and buy a digital SLR camera. I bought the EOS Canon RebelXT and I have not been happier. The shutter speed is excellent and the battery last for days."
1,its hard to make a review over a product you dont have.,"i ordered a camera 2 monthes ago and i have yet to recieve it. not only that, it said on my product tracking that it was delivered to the back door. i am on a military army base in iraq so thats impossible. when i tried to contact the company to find out what is going on (over 5 emails to be exact) i recieved not one response. so, after they took out the money from my bank account, i recieved no product and no response. im in a combat zone so its hard for me to get to a computer/phone. so this has been one frustrating experiance. i will NEVER do bussiness with this company and its pretty obvious to me that they dont care."
5,A great little camera!!,"I bought this camera after finding that my EOS 20D was too cumbersome for hiking in the Sierras. After shooting about 40 images of both friends and scenery, i can only say that the results are spectacular. Images are wonderfully sharp, colors are very true and vivid and the exposure meter does a first rate job under a variety of lighting conditions. The camera is easy to use, (although the power button could stand to be two-sizes bigger,) and it nests very comfortably on the strap inside a jacket, out of the way and weighing practically nothing, yet readily accessible for those sudden shots.I've used several generations of Canon Powershot cameras in the past, as well as the very excellent 20D and I was sceptical about this camera after reading a previous negative review. I have to say that I'm completely sold - a great hiking camera that is also perfect for everyday use."
5,Another Great Olympus Advancement,"This makes my fourth digital camera from Olympus. With each new camera the quality gets better and the price, lower. This camera has many wonderful features and is a joy to handle. The picture quality is excellent. Like most new technology items, Apple products aside, learning the menus and such may be a bit intimidating for the newbies."
4,good bargain,"i've always liked olympus cameras, and this one did not disappoint. this model has since been discontinued, but there are still a few available if you look. the price is right, the performance is typical Olympus. point and shoot ease, but enuf bells and whistles to keep your interest."
5,"What a find! Easy-to-read, well-documented economic primer","This was a great read. Not having a background in economics, I found this book gave me a birds-eye view of the story behind the current ""economic miracle,"" and put a lot of everyday things in startling perspective. A lot of the time books like this are dense and lose their usefulness by not connecting to day to day happenings. On top of the information, the charts and graphics are bright, clear and, startling. They play out the story of the book in crisp detail. I found this book also extremely helpful in talking to other people about why things are not what they seem. Shifting Fortunes also does not dwell on the negatives as it offers a number of clear policy alternatives beyond its rationale for sharing our country's wealth. When I read recent news coverage on CEO pay and current policies, this book served as a helpful ""spin-detector."""
1,Communism for morons!,"Hey, if you have been living in a cave for the last hundred years, or if you are not American, these communist ideas might be new to you.Unfortunately, it is the same garbage that has been promoted in American Universities since most were built. The media has never stopped promoting these same simple ideas. The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer!Like we care! Just more wolves whining at the piece of meat that can't have."
4,"A ""B"" PERFORMANCE","Here's an enjoyable little treat à la Friday the 13th, in which some cool majorettes are getting bumped off one by one at the hands of a psychopath, whose identity is only revealed at the end of the journey. A sort of grade B ""giallo"" novel for the slasher crowd. John Russo delivers the goods with a fast-paced rhythm and a sense of crudeness that fits like a serial killer glove. Although none of his characters are memorable, the premature execution of their livelihood, however, is downright effective. Russo may not be prose-witty, but the tight direction with which he controls his narrative packs a good punch. Yes, the only thing one may get out of picking up THE MAJORETTES is spending a few hours of twisted mindless fun, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, is there? -----Martin Boucher"
2,Sleazy slasher mystery.,"When he could not secure financing for his script, John Russo (co-screenwriter of Night of the Living Dead) adapted it into a novel. A serial predator is killing cheerleaders, lots of sex, violence, and sado-masochism, but little suspense. Only of moderate interest to NotLD fans."
4,Great For Those Who MUST Travel With Their Pets,A good travel guide for the pet lover who can't bear to leave their pets at home. Hundreds of pet friendly places to choose from and quite a bit of information about each.
4,"Pricey, but EXACTLY what we were looking for","Not the cheapest of the ""instant Pancake makers"", but certainly just what we were looking for. Hadn't seen one of these since our original ""Magic Chef"" fell off the counter and broke. Works really well, quick to heat up, easy to clean, and makes really cool little omelette's as well!"
4,Pancakes for Two,"If you are making Pancakes for two this is a great product. It is small easy to clean, easy to store and the pancakes come up nice and brown and hot...... It there are more than two people its gets a little tight, you the cook get to spend a lot of time pouring and standing and waiting and will be the last to eat, when everyone else has gone shopping :) Or you could get someone else to do the cooking!! Like the first person finished with their pancakes..I really do like this product..."
5,Pancake Factory,I started cooking pancakes in the army in 1957 and have tried about every type of griddle there is. I have more fun with the Pancake Factory than any other pancake griddle I have tried. It is faster and makes the same size pancake each time. I love to use it and have had lots of fun experimenting with different pancake batters. A coating of Pam before heating helps.
3,Raw Power Surfacings 1;Trey Gunn,"Fresh,eclectic modern jazz! Not unlike ""Passport"" in some respects. By far my favorite track is ""Heavenly Groove""."
4,Good cleaning kit,"Only used once so far but the cleaning kit works great for any of my various gauge shotguns, definitely recommend!"
4,Does not fit,They included Towncar Ultimate L series in compatible list. But it is about 2 ft short for the car. Do not fits completely on the car. Not recommended if your car is Towncar Ultimate L. Otherwise the material and finish is good.
2,Cover didn't fit like was stated.,Website claimed that this cover would fit a 2005-2008 Chrysler 300. It didn't and plus I found the same cover at Wal-mart for $8 less.
5,Captivating Story,"What a wonderful story. I was captivated by the hero's reluctance to capture the young telepath,Serena. She is a heroine I appreciate, as she does not sulk or carry a grudge through out the whole story, but embraces her new life. I fell hopelessly in love with the hero,Darian. This story was unique and imaginative and well written. My first Saranne Dawson book, and definitely not my last."
5,the best for the money & delibery on time ; God Bless You!,make shure you put this one on a heavy enclosure!otherwise it move away.
1,Do not even try!,"Just bought two of these woofers as replacement for my Advent Prodigy Tower speakers and I can not be more dissapointed! There is no way this woofers to handle shown specs. Sound is flat, rubber suspension can not even handle half inch cone excursion, so bass is distorted. Is this to hold 300 watts RMS and 800w peak? Never in this life!I have a speaker selector and I compared these with my old school Bose 201 (15 years old) and my Polk S6, almost same age. There was no doubt Pyramid was a waste of time, money and shipping charges, so packed them back for a return.Believe me, if you really need an 8 inch woofer, try Polk Audio or better brand. Not cheap but worth it! Do not buy any Pyramid, Pyle, Lanzar, ect. Specs are a joke!Shipping in was $16.00 wasted money. Return shipping $16.00 wasted. Restocking fees, who knows!!! More wasted money... R"
5,Just as promised,"The book was in ""new"" condition as promised and was delivered in a timely manner. Thank you!"
3,This is OLD MATERIAL,"If you are looking for a book describing the swing that Don Trahan demonstrated recently (5/2004) on Golf Academy Live, then this isn't it. There is still a lot of good information on grip, alignment, chipping, and putting--standard fare. But this IS NOT the limited turn, quiet lower body swing displayed on TGC."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!,"I can't comment on the product itself, only on the fact that it was ordered on Sept. 16, didn't ship until app. Dec. 16, but wouldn't allow me to cancel the order. I tried many times, and even had the people at Amazon trying to help me. I will never order a product from Target THROUGH Amazon again. It was ordered from my college Freshman, and I ended up going TO Target when I went to visit her, one month into school."
2,Good for a kid?,"I won one of these (it's white with a black pick guard) and it was my first bass guitar. It was okay to learn on but as I started learning about the bass I started finding all the flaws in this instrument. 2 of the screws that hold the pick guard on were stripped and just fell out within the first week of owning it. The strings are way too high off the fret board even after adjusting the bridge all the way it would allow. The frets are jagged and I had to file them down on either side after cutting my hand and my pants on them a few times. It doesn't hold a tune for more than one session and the neck isn't straight inline with the body. I'm glad I won it because it was a great help in learning to play bass, but no I would never pay for one of these. This is also one of the heaviest bass guitars I've ever held."
1,God-awful,"The neck was super bent and didn't even work when plugged into amps. Made me more cautious when picking out instruments so I guess it kinda helped... Still, by far the worst, most misleading thing I've ever bought. Do NOT buy this, look elsewhere, anywhere, just be careful."
3,ehh,"my son played one for his church, it sounded good. later we got him an epiphone, made the barcelona sound mediocre at best.still, good value for beginner."
1,this bass is a joke,"the pickups are lined up in a retarded fashion,I had to fix them because some idiot did a sloppy job putting them in the retarted fashion that their in. thy gave me a VIOLIN string with it. the tuners suck,their big fat califlowers and the headstock should be black, that way its not so obvious the the company that makes it is a bunch of unknown lose. this bass is a perfect example of why austin bazaar are a bunch of nobodys.(buy ESP,Ibanez,or Gibson)"
2,Not to happy,"This was a Christmas gift, and to be honest when my nephew opened it, he was trilled, but we I looked more closely at the Bass Guitar I was embarrassed to have given this as a gift, the neck was NOT varnished a couple of dings on the top of it, some scuff marks on the body of the Bass, and loose crews.I do not recommend this seller at all."
1,"Don""t buy this unless you are Jaco Pastorius","It has six strings, I sent an e-mail to them and all they said was return it."
5,One of my favourite books ever written...,"I remember first checking this book out of the library when I was a teenager, and in need of beauty and truth. This book delivered. In this love story about star-crossed lovers and magic is a heap of beauty and truth. Nancy Springer wrote a tale about a girl named Cerilla and her lover, Arlen, and made it more than a love story. It's a story about the bonds of friendship,the tie of gratitude, the magic of a religion, and the power of forgiveness and acceptance. I can't recommend this book enough. If only it were in an ebook format."
2,"Some very good, some bad","I bought this book to help bring me up to speed on PLCs. I have several years working in electronics and other engineering disciplines, but almost no system control experience.I did learn a few things from this book and it was helpful. However, there are some serious mistakes in the book. There are several details that are simply wrong, which makes this book a poor choice for people with little to no prior knowledge in the field."
2,binder issues,i recieved this book today. and although i think the printing is easy to read and the book is small enough to be taken anywhere. i do however feel that if the binder itself were not put on backwards i could give book a lot higher marks.i bought this book as a gift for a family member and i do not think it will be very good when she recieves it and has to go the back to get to the front.it must have been late on a friday when it went through quality control.

4,History on plastic...,"Some of the tracks are less than perfect, but WOW, the HISTORY of DoWop! Pop this in the player, you have no choice but to sing along."
3,Beware!,"Here is what I think of this disc. The Sergio Mendes has been re-recorded. It IS NOT the original used on the A&M Christmas Variety LP. On the latter SM& Brazil 66 were the best cut, but this cd presents some weak-kneed version of the Christmas Song I wanted. Mendes was obviously aware that his first version was a cult hit, and that it was not available on cd...but he should have left the hit version stay rare-ified! Plus the disc is very poorly concieved. The quality of each selection is mediocre as well. Definitely NOT worth more than $2.99!"
5,Best board book for adults,Out of this world entertainment. You'll be a fan of M+K+E1. You will want to buy all of M+K+E1 products. Your thoughts will be affected. You will be under their control.
2,Wish I knew the dimensions off this thing,"Looks like what I need, but who knows? I need a replacement glass shade and it needs to fit. This guy tells you nada :("
2,Not Appropriate for Elementary Age,"I felt like this was inappropriate for elementary age students. It talks to openly about the body and it's changes. I would not use this in a classroom setting or give it to anyone under perhaps 15. I think children under this age are just too young for the wording. It's a shame too, because I really like this author. I am surprised to see this was suggested for children who are 10 years old or 5th grade."
2,only lasted 5 years,I got this weather radio in March 2007. It worked great for 5 years and then in March 2012 it started randomly sounding the alarm and giving me a reception error. And it hasn't sounded the alert for any of the storm warnings we've had lately. I live near Joplin Missouri which had the EF5 tornado last year so I really want a dependable radio. I wanted to give it 3 stars for being a great radio for 5 years but after reading that so many others are having the same problem with it I decided to give it 2 stars. Now I'm off to find me a new weather radio :(
4,Lifesaver with a few annoying habits,"We bought this product a couple of years ago because we live in tornado alley in Southern Indiana. It has saved us in the middle of the night more than once. We have experienced the ""reception errors"" that others complain of and have been woken up during the night a few times as a result, but I consider than only an ""annoying habit"" compared to the lifesaving features of this product. The ability to limit the notifications to your area and turn off the types of alerts you don't want to hear make it very versatile. If you have family in other counties and want to keep watch for them too, you can do that. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this exact radio three months ago. A few days after the 90 day warranty expired it started going off several times during the night and day. Siren and the red light with message ""Radio Reception Error"". Noone had an answer for me. Guess I'll pitch it in the trash and buy one from Radio Shack."
1,Huge waste of money,"This radio is a huge waste of money and not worth purchasing. It functioned properly for a few weeks after I programmed it and then started throwing error messages on a regular basis. Then, it would cease to function about every two weeks - be completely dead. This necessitated disconnecting it from the power source, removing the back up batteries then replacing them and reconnecting it, and reprogramming ALL the functions and settings. It would then operate for another couple of weeks, and then stop again...the whole thing had to be repeated. I have finally disconnected it permanently and it is going in the garbage. I am purchasing a Metro radio and recommend that anyone in the market for a weather radio buy ANY one but this First Alert piece of shoddy workmanship."
3,Worked great till it burnt out,"Radio worked very well for us in upstate SC. Range was quite good and, being close to a nuclear plant, the Nuclear Emergency codes are pretty important to us. Amber alert worked great (unfortunately at 2AM... ugh..) Everything was fine until one weekend we noticed all the lights were illuminated and none of the programming would work anymore. Totally unresponsive.Of course we're out of the 90 day warranty. By the way, 90 day warranty? I mean seriously, is the product not more dependable than that? I'm going to replace this radio with a unit that provides at least a 1 year warranty.Opinions expressed here are the sole product of the author and do not represent the opinions of Amazon, Sima Corp., the federal government, the president, the pope or my mom (though she'll probably agree with me.)"
2,Interesting,"Although very interesting, I still felt this book needed a bit more. I can't quite put my finger on it, it could be more about the characters, it could be more details,....I don't know. Some of the description was a bit over the top, as in overly prosaic to being cliche. So maybe the author could start with eliminating that.However, it is still an interesting read-- for what it is."
4,nice mix of tech and bajoran mystique,"This was a good mix of science fiction, in which science combats the odds, and fantasy in which a child is sought and found to save a world. The writer must have made some study of refugee camps to give such a lively impression, and she sure has a way of looking at people that is revealing and kind at the same time.There were some uncomfortable points in which the story comes to a virtual stand still, and then restarts again, that's why I can't give the 5 points I had in mind ""It does not matter we cannot live to taste the fruit; still we must plant the trees"""
1,not impressed,This is supposed to be a begginers course in Japanese and so why many of the vocabulary words are written in Kanji and not just Hiragana or Katakana is beyond me. In Japan the natives themselves do not bother with Kanji untill around intermediate school so this really pissed me off.
1,Pyle falsely advertises it's specifications,"The PDWR6T speakers do not come with a 50W 70V transformer as advertised. This false specification is claimed on many web sites as well as on the box.Upon examination of the speakers, only a 30W transformer is used.Pyle Pro is very unresponsive to customer complaints. Even after being informed of this problem, they do not change their advertised specifications. The only option the customer has is to return the speakers at a loss of shipping costs. Not customer friendly.I would urge caution on trusting any specification from a Pyle productAmazon.com needs an easier way for customers to register complaints about false advertising from manufacturers."
5,great value in 70 volt outdoor speakers,"I received the speakers in perfect brand new condition, and they sounded great.unfortunately, My end user customer decided he wanted a black colored speakerwhich these are not available in black."
5,Still a Winner,"I was a fan of TMNT as a kid and bought this set for my two younger kids ages 4 and 7. These movies are still a winner, my kids enjoyed them much better than the newly released TMNT movie."
4,Could have been better but pretty satisfying.,"Everyone should agree that the 1st film is the best, with its dark tone but still very funny and quirky. the 2 and 3 are just plain kids stuff. it's kinda hard to watch them again, especially when you're 26. fortunately nostalgia compensates all that. one big letdown of course is the extras..not much going on there. i could only imagine how good the set would be if they had more stuff. i don't know, commentaries like the TMNT dvd which was very fun to listen to, behind the scenes etc etc.but all we have are a bunch of old trailers and lame features. the 4 stars are solely based on the great shape the films are. if you miss these films, then i suggest you buy this collection while it's pretty cheap. cowabunga....."
5,Great old classic,The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3-Pak is an awesome buy. My wife is a real fan from when the turtles first hit the scene. The gift pack was just what she was looking for. I'd definitely recommend this selection to any TMNT fan!
4,COWABONGA!!!,When i watch the movies it brings back old school memories. Great price for all three movies. The only issue i have is that neither movies comes with any special features even though its on a blu-ray. I would have liked to see some extras or a featurette of the making of the movies but nothing. the movies look great and i recommend for anyone thats a fan.
4,A Great Collection For Two Great Movies,"I loved the Ninja Turtles as a kid, and to have these three movies on Blu Ray is going to be a vital part of sharing my nostalgia with my children. Upon re-watching these films on war-torn VHS last year, I realized that they hold up pretty well as enjoyable kids' movies. Well, the first two do. The third movie was terrible and I knew it when I was nine. Still, for inclusion's sake, I'm glad it's in the package."
4,bought this for my boyfriend,"My boyfriend is a huge ninja turtle fan so i bought this for him for his birthday, hopefully he will like it.The package came fast and it is in mint condition brand new very happy with the service i received as well as the product"
1,None of the discs play on my Blu Ray,The discs are pretty but I am guessing your print job screwed up the data on the discs and now none of the discs play. I will be returning them.
5,TMNMFT,"This Blu-ray isn't the megaultra rich kid version , but its still pretty friggan great , you've got vigilanties , a giant rat , a dude whos dressed us as a kitchen utensil , and mutant ninja friggan turtles , pretty epic"
4,Awesome,Had been searching for this item at a reasonable price. Finally Amazon.com provided the breakthrough.The shipment duration did take a little extra time than scheduled but I finally got it in an excellent condition even though it was an International shipment.Thanks Amazon.com for this. Will be looking forward to another transaction with Amazon.com
3,Teenage mutant ninja turtle DVD 3 pak,The third disc doesn't work of the series wouldn't play. The first two discs of the series played fine. However my nephew is still very disappointed because he wants to see how the trilogy ends. I am now looking for the third disc.
2,Didn't all work,Three movies came in the pack... One of them never worked. Tried on three different DVD players and of course it was my daughters favorite movie that didn't work... Disappointed
4,My kid will love the original's,"Because I did when I was his age, and I will not stand by and let Michael Bay ruin this for him/me.Even if I can't stop him from seeing Michael Bay's abortion of a movie, at least I can have peace of mind that he knows how it was meant to be. From that point forward, he can decide."
5,Turtle Time!,"My TMNT VHS tape were worn out years ago and I found this DVD set on sale at my local Walmart a few years ago around Christmas. I think I bought for $17 as well as the The Essential Steve McQueen Collection (Bullitt Two-Disc Special Edition / The Getaway Deluxe Edition / The Cincinnati Kid / Papillon / Tom Horn / Never So Few).The movies are just as I remember them, but the first is the best.This set would make any TMNT fan happy!"
4,TMNT 1-3 review,The delivery of the product was fast and there was no damage to it anyway. The videos themselves were of great quality with nothing wrong with them at all. The quality and speedy care makes me want to buy from amazon more often.
1,They took my money,They sent me a completely different DVD after it took forever to arrive. I mailed it back and they never gave my money back or sent me the correct DVDs.
3,Yes!,"I wanted to rate this five stars, but there are zero features, it is literally the movies... I was looking forward to some of the behind the scenes stuff...."
1,Buyer Beware,ConsOne out of the three DVD did not work.Poor quality videos very grainy in some scencesvery disappointedProsCan't think of any
4,Exactly what I wanted.,"It was fantastic except the plastic that hold the disc was broke. Otherwise, fantastic. Seriously freaking awesome, I need more words...."
5,Wonderful movies!,Who doesn't love a brand new set of live action teenage mutant ninja turtles movies!?!? This item arrived well packaged and in great condition.
4,Great deal,This was a Christmas present for my older son. Even at 26 this DVD would bring him memories of his childhood! DVD arrived with a great cover & included all 3 movies ! A awesome find! Shopping over holidays I never saw it in any stores. This was a great find!
2,lukewarm,"I read this play for an introductory French literature class at Swarthmore. I read it in French, so doubtless I missed a lot, but I found it to be dull and redundant. Before we began ""Bérénice,"" the professor actually told us, ""Dans cette pièce, rien ne se passe, et personne ne meurt""--nothing happens, and no one dies. She was right. Essentially, Titus and Antiochus love Bérénice, Queen of France, and it plays out through dialogue. I actually think we read the play primarily because it was so repetitive; it meant we would understand more. I'm sure Racine has better things to offer than ""Bérénice""; that's why it's not one of his best-known works. Read something else."
4,NICELY DONE,"She's a Prince protege with some talent. Doesn't compare to Prince in the showmanship, but, overall nicely done."
4,Good book but no sources,"This is an interesting and easy to read story of Hank Williams. I read the whole thing, however, wondering where the author got his information. Obviously, he interviewed Don Helms, but I don't know who else he interviewed or how much material he took from Colin Escott or other biographers. How does he know Lon Williams suffered from a fist in the face instead of gas in France? Sources are important in biographies. Although I enjoyed reading this book, I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known it contained no source notes or bibiography. The absence of photos also decreases its value."
4,An appetizer,"This is a very good book, but it is rather short and has no photographs. I'm keeping this book, but I'll look for another biography of Hank to augment it."
2,Unremarkable....,"Hemphill brings nothing new to the table.Because this book was just rehash of better books before it, I found it unsatisfying.The author comes out of the starting gates, sentimental and reflective, with every intention to write a story, in first person....and I thought I was being taken into A Hank story from a fresh perspective...thinking perhaps that maybe the kid had crossed paths with him a long time ago.......and then, oddly and abruptly, its switches into a Matter-of-fact delivery of Hank's factual life story?Escott's bio is extraordinary....Hemphill coming in on the heels of it...failed to bring anything of his own. Seriously, Im not sure why he wrote the book, when he offered next to nothing new....and in some areas, quite a bit less.Its not a horrible book, its just not special."
3,Queen Ultra Sheer Panty Hose,"One thing a tall gal with curves runs into, is finding things long enough to do the job. If these had been about three inches longer in length, they would have been really comfortable to wear. One thing clothing companies of many makes has, is a problem in thinking that someone of my weight (260#) is only 5'5"". I'm 6' tall. Just make them stretch a little longer please!"
5,Brilliant Independants,It's truly a wonder that this band isn't more popular. On this live set are stellar performances of all superb material. Coyote tunes are very accessible and sometimes the jamming soars of into the stratosphere. This record is flawless!
3,A great resource for anyone cruising to Bermuda on a yacht.,"Helpful information for any crossing to Bermuda, with essentials on preparations for the 600+-mile passage. Foolproof navigation advice and color sketch charts let you cruise Bermuda waters with confidence. GPS waypoints for key positions around Bermuda and the outer reef. A little long in the tooth (1994), but not much has really changed since then. And this is the ONLY cruising guide to Bermuda, so it's not like you have a lot of choices. By the way, it was written by the director of the Bermuda Maritime Museum, Dr. Edward Harris, and his wife Jane."
5,On Brassey's Modern Fighters,"Awesome!!!! Though I'm only 10, accurate photos and easy- to- read text allowed me to learn a lot about fighters."
5,Great text and photographs.,"The book was absolutely well worth reading. Thephotos are great with lots of aerial shots. Textis easy to read and comprehend, especially forthose who do not know anything about militaryaircraft. Anyone interested in fast-jets shouldpurchase this book as a starter."
5,EXCELLENT brush both for performance AND price!,I ordered this brush and found it to work VERY WELL! It performs well and the price is good also. I really like this particular brush and the same style/type brush by Leapers. Both work EQUALLY WELL and are right around the same price point and last roughly the same amount of time.
5,Always have used Otis,Otis continues to make me happy at the cleaning bench. I have many other Otis products and this brush fits right into the satisfied list of my other Otis cleaning tools.
5,Great Tool,Great brush for getting all of the brass off of the feed ramps and getting excess carbon out of the lugs.
5,Chamber Brush,"This is a great product for an AR 15, if you havent tried OTIS products-you are missing out. Well made quality product"
5,Holds up and cleans well!,Works as advertised. Used it about 20-30 times and still is in good working order without issues. It's threaded to attach to your cleaning rods or could be chucked in a drill for tough cleaning.
2,A bit of a contradiciton,"The overall astrology and numerology is a bit bland and run of the mill (Aquarians are different and focused on humanitarian goals? Shocking!). I expect consistency at the base levels, and that's fine. What I look for is a book that takes it to a new level of understanding. So, I read deeper hoping to find some depth.What I found was a jarring juxtaposition of God and astrology. And not just God in an abstract, metaphysical sense. God God. As in His will and prayer and all that.I grew up in the church and I respect an individual's right to practice whatever religion they choose, and I understand that there are Christians who believe in astrology. Heck, I was one. But I feel this would have been a much more accessible book had these connections not been made or at least not *quite* so frequently.Over all shallow and preachy. If you must read it, get it from the library. Don't waste your money. For a better read, tryDarkside Zodiac."
5,Great inside on human nature. Easy to undestand and use.,"This book offers a very innovative approach to the exploration of the human nature. It is rare to transmit depth with an entertainig flair. The extensive biographical research gives the unique insight into the application of the author's method. This is an easy to read and relate book, while giving at the same time a non-judgmental and compassionate overview."
1,Sad little book,"This book has nothing positive to say. Whether your ""spirit"" or your ""ego"" takes over the outcome is never positive. I checked everyone I know and love and nothing that the author had to say was uplifting or encouraging. I threw the book away. Something I would never normally do but it's so negative I couldn't imagine if someone actually took it seriously.An amazing book that I would recommend on the subject is ""What Your Birthday Says About You"" by Phyllis Vega -In that book when I flipped to my page it had a sidebar that read ""In Macao, the birthday of the ancient goddess A-Ma, patroness of fishermen and sailors..."" I had to laugh because my name is Amy and I live in a Marina."
5,The book gives a universal view of your life.. quite nicely done,"I am no expert on astrology, in fact, this is my first book on the subject. It was a great choice. I felt like a picture of this moment in time was opened up to a universal picture of past, present, and future. It is a lovely gift to myself."
4,Great second choice,"My intention when I was finally ready to purchase a camcorder was the Optura 85. I had picked it over the ZR 400 for the accessory shoe and flash. However, given that our vacation was a week away, the Optura would not have been shipped until well after we returned.We took the ZR 400 on our trip to Disney World and it performed very well. Outdoor video was great. Indoors it performed quite well. In the Playhouse Disney show it adjusted well and captured the show with great resolution and focus.I was also looking for a camcorder that could do analog-digital conversion and this function has been excellent.It only looses a star for a touchy on/off switch. I had it in a camera bag with my digital camera and somehow it got turned on in the bag. I captured great audio of the ""It's a Small World Ride,"" but no video."
3,Not loud enough,"I recently purchased this muffler for my 2009 Chevy Colorado. It's a 5.3L, 300 HP engine. At idle, I really see no difference in sound. When you press on the accelerator, you get a little bit of a roar, but not much. There is very little drone at higher speeds which is fine. I also bought this muffler because I thought I could slightly improve my gas mileage, but not sure about that yet. I was just expecting more. I don't know anything about welding so I had it done at the local Midas shop. I think I will save my money again and try the Super-Flow model. Same brand."
4,Love Hate Dept. Not there best album though.,"I have 2 other Hate Dept albums(Meat your maker, and technical difficulties). This album has some great tracks like ""Bitch"", New Power, and This Doggy Bites. But that last few songs are nothing special. Hate dept. Is up there with the best of Industrial-Techno."
5,Continuing Care Retirment Communities (An Insider's Guide),"This is a complete guide to continuing care retirement communities-what they are, how they operate, how to choose one that is right for you, and lots more. It's a remarkable resource.After three years of intensive research and visits to numerous places, the author wrote the book she says she wishes she'd had in the beginning.Though it's short, 120 pages, this insider's guide is just that-a complete survey of information about retirement communities (limited to three states, but applicable anywhere), with much of the nitty-gritty information like tables, comparison of costs, checklists, bibliography, resources of print and web sites and other helpful tips in the Appendix at the back.While Continuing Care Retirement Communities, An Insider's Guide is a serious, thoughtful, and instructive work, it is also a very amusing account of the Hunts' long journey from Long Island to Gladwyne. I enjoyed it so much that I read it twice.Alice Lonsdorf"
5,A Real Lifesaver!,"This book is essential for anyone considering moving into a continuing care retirement community. It saved my husband and me from falling into pitfalls that would have been disastous for us. The book, which is clearly written in an engaging manner, tells everything you'll need to know before making the all-important decision that will last the rest of your life. My husband and I followed the guidelines given in the book and are the happiest we have ever been. Thank you Bernice Hunt for this fabulous book."
4,Excellent After Accident Review,"This book is a must read for new divers. It will really drive home the points that you were taught during certification. I don't recommend this book to the non-diver however I think it might scare non-divers out of the water.Great after dive analysis, not only a great read but also teaches from others mistakes."
2,Shallow...no pun intended.,"I bought this book because I love all things SCUBA. Also, because I'm still a novice diver and am always looking for ways to improve my skills under water. I'm constantly inventing up underwater disaster scenarios and working through them in my head so I thought this book would be interesting to me at the very least.In a few words, it's just very elementary. The real-world SCUBA accidents are very common sensical and I found myself skimming through most of it. There were a couple of antidotes that were fun to read, but if you're a serious diver, you're way past this book..."
3,Nice but a bit sensationalist,"Nice write-up and the way it is written it is easy to put yourself in the divers shoes and imagine how accidents went down. The flip side of this coin is that it is written a bit in a sensationalist style, and while a useful read for any diver it might actually put some people off from diving."
5,Highly recommend !!,"Excellent book! The author has more diving experience than anybody I've ever heard of. This book will scare you as a diver, but in my humble opinion, it will give you years of experience in being safety conscious.I gave it to my dive buddy after I read it, and told him to pass it on when he is done. Remember to have your gear serviced regularly and HAVE FUN!! Enjoy"
4,"Good, but","I am not sure why I am fascinated by diver errors, but I am. Maybe it is because I like to have a plan for anything that could go wrong. The book was good, but I was left wanting more. Internet searches, PADI, Scubaboard, etc. will give you more."
3,"Well,","I would recommend this book to beginner divers. I would not recommend it to experienced divers, or someone (like myself) who's already read and learned about scuba diving. Having read Shadow Divers and Deep Descent previously, not much in this book was new to me, and the tales here are very basic, simple."
2,Misleading blurb.,"This book claims to be about diving accidents. Yes, there are certainly accidents in the book, but for some reason the writer has found it necessary to also make this a manual about diving. I am irritated by having to turn page after page of a book I have paid for, to be told things I already know. I assume that most readers choosing this book would be qualified divers. As such, we already know most of the ""teaching"" material in the book. We did not buy the book to be taught what is in every scuba course, we bought it to hear of scuba accidents, presumably to be better prepared to avoid them. The advertising is at best unclear, and at worst dishonest."
5,Should be mandatory reading,This is one of those books that is hard to read yet also hard to put down. It should be mandatory reading for all new divers. Learn from the mistakes of others. This book could save your life someday.
4,"Enjoyable and informative book on the 914, but...","First off, it's great to see a well-researched book about the 914. This one covers a lot of the high-level details of the model from year to year, and has good coverage of the corporate, economic, and regulatory changes during the years the 914 was produced and marketed. I thought it gave a real understanding of the many factors that led to the demise of the model. And there are many high-quality illustrations that were new to me. However along the way Mr. Long ileaves a sprinkling of disparaging remarks and slights, revealing at one point that he is really a zealous devotee of another overlooked Porsche, the 924. These occassional snipes give a sour aftertaste to an overwise excellent and enjoyable book, hence the loss of the fifth star. If you're a fan of the 914, or want to know what happened to it, this is a fine book."
4,"Decent quality shoe, not perfect or as shown","The shoe functions just fine. Nice and smooth.However, the sliding wedge I received was black, not clear. Also, the acrylic was fairly scuffed and smudged with several scratches as well. The low price discouraged me from wasting my time returning, but that is only cosmetic and I care more about function."
5,Excellent card shoe,"Have had it for about 3 weeks. Good quality heavy plastic, cards are dealt smoothly. The roller weight keeps the cards at the right angle for a smooth operation."
5,Exactly what I ordered,"This product works exactly as it's supposed to.For anyone wondering, the shoe itself is made out of thick plastic, very durable, and the weight inside is a heavy cylinder with a plastic overlay that scoops the cards. Rolls very smooth."
4,Grandma visits,"I purchased this book for my mother for Mother's Day. This is her first Mother's Day as a grandmother. She, Zoe(the dog)and I visit my sister and nephew that live a couple of states over every 4-6 weeks. At the end of each trip, she can't wait til the next. I thought this would be fitting for her to make a video of her reading for my 8 month old nephew to watch when we come to visit. I just thought it was very fitting with the image of grandma coming with her cute dog following behind."
2,Uninspired,"I was hopeful Fong-Torres could capture the spirit of Gram Parsons personality and music but am seriously disappointed in this bio. I have read literally hundreds of biographies, as it is my favorite form of reading, and this is inexcusably boring and tedious. This reads so flat that at times I questioned the interest Fong-Torres had in his subject. And far too often the path of an anecdote about the life of Parsons would literally lead to a conclusion of no consequence, as though the author had to really struggle to find imaginative stories to illustrate his viewpoint. The reader begins to feel this truly is a story about a musician whose talent and impact have been greatly exaggerated (I'm beginning to believe this). The proof of Gram's alledged greatness seems to be neither in this book nor in his music."
4,My Opinion,The Life and Times of Gram Parsons is a great source of information about the music scene during that era. I found the book to be very well written and interesting. I have always loved Gram's music and have been curious about this cult figure. He was here such a short time but his music has left a tremendous impact on many musicians. This book is well worth the read!! I only wished for more pictures.
4,Informative Biography,"Having an interest in the life of Gram Parsons, I enjoyed reading this biography. It could have had more photos. Other than that, I am glad I purchased this book."
3,good info of minor star,"Biography of minor rock star Gram Parsons who influences many more past his death than while he was living The book does include alot of information and is not exactly focused he led an interesting life and his circumstances such as his ""trust fund"" being around the Stones and Emmylou Harris are interesting"
2,"Facts, But No Flow...","Fong-Torres has done an impressive job of gathering facts on Parsons, but does little to paint a portrait of him as an artist and person. Too many seemingly important events are mentioned in passing only, as if they're were on Fong-Torres' list of things to include. This book tells you very little about a lot of different elements to Parson's life. I was left wanting to know more about fewer events.This book is a very wide but very shallow storehouse of facts and snippets of interviews."
3,Wanting More,"While this is an interesting read - giving readers a long listing of events in this short,tragic life. There is almost no ""feel"" for what made Gram tick -or how he came posess the unique powers and vision to be a pioneer in his musical genre. The events of his life are detailed - but without a feeling for how or why the events affected him the way they did. I still don't really know why he was so tormented or how it was such a tortured soul could feel his way clear to writing a song like Hickory Wind. I intuit that he was so much more than a ""trust fund"" hippie- A person such as this who had the vision to meld rock and country music and have a feel for the true essence of country - must have had a strong feeling for the essential purity of it - but this book offers very little insight. I still recommend the book for what I assume is an accurate telling of the facts."
2,Nothing like Karen Salmansohn other books.,"You can't beat her book - Enough, Dammit: A Cynic's Guide to Finally Getting What You Want out of Life.And the other title How to Be Happy, Dammit: A Cynic's Guide to Spiritual Happiness - is pretty good.This one unless you are a collector, I would avoid. Somehow the other two work, even though there is a lot of design to them, the content is really good.I personally think that the design will date itself rather quickly.But then she can just do a new layout with same content.Buy Enough, Dammit, Dammit!"
3,"Good design, but this one not put together too well","I use this with a Caldwell Rock BR front rest. The shape works well with all my rifles and the material is great. The design of this bag also makes it easy to change the amount of media filled in it. Unfortunately, the stitching came apart in the front after just a few uses. I used caulk to hold it together and it seems to be working. I probably would have given it more stars but a Caldwell front rest bag I own came apart at the stitching as well during my first use. I figured it was a fluke but now my second bag did the same thing. I am very gentle on my stuff, so this should not happen - at least so soon."
3,Good but not the best for my needs,Fine for casual use as it was probably intended for. However you can't compare it with the more expensive Protector Leather bags for Match use.
4,Solid Rear Support,"This is a good partner for my Caldwell Rock Jr. rifle rest. It provides snug support for the butt of the rifle and can be squeezed for fine adjustment to the rear of the rifle when shooting. It's also heavey enought to not slide around much when shooting. If you get this, look at the Rock or Rock jr. for the front end as well. They work well together."
4,Good bag,"This is a good bag. The only thing I changed was taking some of the filling out. It came packed as tight as could be, making the bottom rounded and keeping it from sitting flat. Also it was hard as a rock with no give. Take a little out and you're good to go."
5,A Wonderful Trip to Yesteryear,"This is a wonderfully accurate and brief trip to the heart of our history. It's a vivid ride via poetry and prose, magically interspersed with primary historical documents."
2,Sort of dull,"There is hardly someone who does not know Jack Lemmon, or who does not bump into one of his movies, sooner or later. If someone should, though, have a urge of knowing him, I'd say they would rather rent one of the above mentioned movies, than buy this DVD.I suppose this product has Jack Lemmon's fans as target.Well, for someone who loves him as an actor and would have liked to know a little bit more about him, both as an actor and as a man, well, it is rather disappointing.As much as the man is brilliant, forceful, quick and capable to squeeze a smile or a tear from even the most hardheaded guy on earth, as dull, weak, slow, and soulless this product is.Sorry."
5,Great Show!,"I have Netflix and this was recommanded to me, loved the show. Great new actors and story line, it's totally different from the original movie. Reminds me of Supernatural with a werewolf twist to the story. I also love this show so far that there's no vampires in it. I'm tired of all the vampire shows that are coming out. I'll take a werewolf show anyday.Can't wait to see season 2."
1,"Great in theory, but poor in execution.","The box said it would fix Milwaukee and Skil circular saws, which I have. I have a Skil 77, both corded and cordless Milwaukee circular saws but none of the four bars will fit. Way too much play and the bars are too thin and easily bend - not very safe when you have the power of a Skil 77 or Milwaukee corded saws. Too bad, it could have been an excellent product."
2,Did not do as advertised,"Bought for a Black & Decker jigsaw to cut circles. It fit okay in the slots provided on the saw, only the leading edge of the edge guide was about 4.5"" behind the the blade, so it could not work. It will, however fit a Skil circular saw and a Ryobi 18v circular saw alright, meaning not very spectacularly. It's better to find scrap wood or get a small piece of hardiboard to make a jig for circles, and clamp a long straight-edge to the board if you need a guide. Pass on this one and make your own for cheaper and less headache. At the very least, locate the guide slots on your tools before purchasing."
2,"Fits Bosch, but won't cut circles","It fits perfectly on the Bosch saw I've got if you use the screws that come with the saw (the screws that come with the jig are too long). I'm sure this would work well to use as a guide for a straight cut, but I needed it for a circle cut. Set for a 7"" diameter, the saw won't cut a circle. The geometry is wrong and makes the blade bind and it won't follow the circle. Tried different blades hoping for better results - no luck."
1,Not good enough,"Having tried these out on my new Bosch Jigsaw, I was dismayed by the amount of inaccurate straight cuts this saw guide produced. You get what you pay for and so I did. They were cheaply made and this reflected in their price."
4,Works okay and it's cheap - what more can you ask?,I bought this locally for use on my Craftsman circular saw (model 315.108350) and it worked fine for a straight rip cut. I used a tap to add threads to the hole in my saw's shoe to lock it into place and the edge guide was rock solid after I tightened the bolt. I just ripped a 20' deck board with ease. The bars are a little thin for my taste but it didn't seem to affect the performance.
1,The worst thing I ever seen,This guide is not for real...!!! It twist the cutline as you go ahead on the line.I never did thing this item could be wo weak...!!!
3,Worked at first,"I gave this three stars because it did work for the first week, but then stopped helping me. It effects everyone differently though so it's worth a try for sure :)"
2,Didn't work for me,This was my last attempt to try and increase my milk supply.It didn't work for me after using for 3 weeks. It also made my little one gassy- so it was not worth it to try it longer given the gas issues.
5,Really worked for me!!,I sart using it to increase my supply and it did ntwo days i notice a great difference becase of the reviews i purchase it and it really works thanks i will buy again if needed!!
1,Did Not Work,My wife finished all 100 pills in the bottle and it did not increase her milk production at all. Save your money and spend it elsewhere.
3,It didn't work for me,"I just finished taking this along with the Blessed Thistle and it did nothing for me. All 100 pills, nothing. I guess everyting doesn't work for everybody. It's okthough, because I will stop nursing my daughter when she's six months anyways. In about a month. I did like the fact that I smelled like maple syrup. Weird, but true"
2,Not everything I everything I had wanted,"I had read in a health magazine that Fenugreek was a product that could help enlarge the breasts. I didn't even get to a point with prolonged use to dicover if that was true because these pills had such a funny taste to them, and if you don't eat right away or right before you feel very sick, and still, sometimes after eating you'll feel sick. Purhaps it was the size or the dose"
3,Not too sure...,"I can't really leave a fair review on this product because Im not sure if it worked or not. I paired it with Mother's Milk Tea and didn't see any results, but that could just be my own body."
1,Not a Good Brand for Milk Supply,"This brand did not help me with my milk supply. I bought it because it was a little cheaper than the other brand on this site, and found this to be inferior. The capsules smell like medicine, not maple syrup, and after 2 weeks of taking 3 pills, 3 x a day, I never got the maple syrup sweat like I did with the other brand. I will be switching back and paying a little more for the quality."
5,Fenugreek seed for diabetics,"My mom takes fenugreek seed daily to control her blood sugar level. It works well and she has been able to reduce her dosage of Glucophage.The use of fenugreek for treating diabetes has been scientifically validated (you can read abstracts by doing a keyword search on www.pubmed.gov ).My mom gets it from the Indian grocer where it is much cheaper, though loose and not encapsulated."
1,Don't use this company,"Buy it at your local grocery store, you will get it at least 10 days sooner, and with less stress."
2,Nature's Way a Waste of Time,This brand of fenugreek does not work. If I could send back the open bottle I would have. I will stick with the GNC brand because natures way made my milk supply go down drastically. After taking the GNC brand my milk supply went up.
1,You will smell awful and can make you and/or baby gassy,"I tried taking for a few weeks, 3 caps 3 x's per day as recommended to aide in nursing. I saw absolutely no difference in the amount of milk i was pumping or producing. The way it makes you smell is horrible, too! I swear, the stuff just comes out of your pores and smells like maple syrup. It also made me extremely gassy and made my baby gassy as well. I wouldn't purchase again."
2,hum...,made me smell like curry and retain water all over body.did the job though. not crazy about the side effects. lol.
4,Really works!,"The product works well with Blessed Thistle. The only thing I didn't like was the maple syrup smell that your pores give off while taking this. My husband can smell when I'm around :) lol. I stopped taking it for a few days when I was sick and I still gave off the smell. I was down to only a few drops of breast milk and when I started taking these, I was able to start pumping 3 oz every time like usual. I wish I was able to produce even more than that though because I am still having to supplement with formula."
3,"Item's great, but shipping ...","While I think the product itself is just fine, I was really disappointed that the seller wouldn't ship to an FPO address. I had to rereoute the product just to get it here. I use fenugreek to increase breastmilk supply, though the label does NOT indicate that use for it. I should also mention that the pills smell like maple syrup and, after taking them, I found I did, too!"
3,"For lactation: sometimes helped, sometimes not.","I chugged down dozens of these capsules in the hope that they'd help with lactation. They may have...but not enough that I could say definitively. What really did help me, surprisingly, was massage - every time I had a massage, milk volume tripled."
3,I wish i wouldve known,"While this product DID increase my supply (i went from pumping around 9 oz (on both sides) to 17 in about 5 minutes) it RUINED my daughter. She was fine until i fed her the freshly pumped milk and she wouldnt drink over an ounce without fussing. I fed her directly from my breast (thinking maybe she just didnt want a bottle's nipple) and she ate a little more and fell asleep but then when she woke she screamed for hours as though she were in pain, curled up, turned red, wouldnt sleep for longer than ten minutes and it took me half a day to realize the only thing I had done different was take four of the capsules. I actually LIKED the maple syrup smell but she looked like she was in so much pain I just CANNOT give this a full five stars. There should be something on the label that warns or more reviews about it."
4,Works (but not miracles...),"I noticed an increase of milk production after a week of taking this supplement. I take four capsules three times a day along with blessed thistle (3 capsules, 3 times a day). Previously, I pumped four times a day and got 12 ounces in total; now I get about 15 ounces. The maple syrup smell is not overwhelming but it is easy to feel a bit light-headed and nauseous from the effects on your blood sugar levels so I make sure to take my supplements after a meal. I also notice that the more water I drink and the healthier I eat during the day, the more milk I yield in general. Despite the good and the bad, I will continue my pill-popping regiment because every ounce of milk for my baby is precious."
3,Good product,"This has been a good product for me. It seems to be increasing my milk production, but not by a lot. If you forget to take it once or twice, your milk production will decrease again almost immediately. I'm glad I got this to help me get a little further with breast milk for my child, but if your milk is pretty good and your not good at remembering to take pills, I wouldn't bother."
4,Fenugreek capsules work very well,"Nature's Way Fenugreek capsules work well. After about a full-day of taking 2-3 capsules every 8 hours my milk supply noticably increased (at least 2 oz. more per 4-6 hours). After returning to work my supply noticably decreased, so I use these every day (for over a month now) to keep my supply up since I cannot easily pump during the work day. They do smell very maply and so do I. It's not a bad smell, just odd. Occasionaly I have intestinal distress, but it's not that bad and over quickly.Note: I increased my water intake and drank Mother's Milk tea before trying Fenugreek. Neither the water increase, nor Mother's Milk tea were successful for me in increasing my milk supply."
3,increased volume but,"increased milk volume, but caused extreme gas/pain in the baby, so after 3 days -stopped using it entirely. Mother's Milk tea - worked but triggered colic. will give some formula if not able to produce enough."
5,Wonder-full supplement,"Fenugreek seed helps with digestion if you are not a new mother and breastfeeding. From what I observed, my digestion became more evenly spaced over time, and I was hungry for food later than without taking the fenugreek. I did not take the supplement regularly, however, and gave it to my sister who breastfeeds. I can report her good news that the product works wonders for mothers and babies. If you are a new mother and want an abundance of milk at your baby's feedings, I recommend this product and brand to you."
1,Made my baby so gassy!,"I has been 2 days since I started taking Fenugeek. Day 1, I took 2 pills x 3 but I didn't see any effect. Day 2, I increased 3 pills x 3. I didn't think my milk supply was increasing but it made my son so gassy. He became so fussy, and cried all day because he wasn't able to release gas. I felt so bad that I couldn't do anything to help him.I don't want to see my son suffer anymore, so I will stop taking this."
1,WARNING--DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS!,"I hate to give a bad review since I have no idea if it actually works to improve milk production (which is why I purchased it). I just feel the need to share that I took one dose and experienced a fairly severe allergic reaction. It was 2am and I went online and discovered that fenugreek is in the same plant family as peanuts (and chickpeas). This is not marked anywhere on the label, on Amazon's page, or on Nature's Way's website."
3,I think it helped a little bit,"I think this product helped a little bit, but the milk ""production"" slows down once you stop taking the vitamins."
2,Causes stomach problems,"It barely gets your milk production up by taking the recommended dosage and if you try to take more like some people say to get it to work it can make you very sick to your stomach and you will spend more time on the toilet than pumping milk. It also makes you stink like overcooked maple syrup.I'd rather keep drinking my mother's milk tea and going to look for another supplement, this is just too harsh for me."
5,Increases Milk Supply!,"I used this when my milk supply started to dip. If I took about 7-10 pills a day, I would see an increase."
3,Didnt work for me,"It just didnt work for me, even after taking 2 full bottles, 3 capsules 3 times a day as I had read on the internet."
2,No results,I didn't see any results from taking Fenugreek. I needed a blend of herbs to increase my milk supply. I would highly recommend taking Motherlove More Milk Plus or Special Blend instead of just Fenugreek. The Motherlove product worked within two days and gave me much more milk.
3,Works great for nursing moms,I pump then bottle feed my baby the breast milk. I began taking this as directed (2 pills/3x a day) and was able to pump about 2-3oz of milk each time (I pumped every 3 hours) on each side. When I noticed my baby started needing more I began taking 3 pills/3x a day and now get about 3-4oz each time I pump (still every 3 hours) on each side. I gave it 3 stars because my hope is I won't have to keep increasing the dosage just to pump more. Anyway it seems to be working out OK so far. Hope this review helps!
4,BE CAREFUL,"I took the pill (3x3)two days only but had to stop because my baby started having runny stool ( like diarrhea). I wish I could take it longer to see if it worked or not! So keep an eye on your baby , you dont want her to get diarrhea. Unfortunatey, It could be one of the side effects..."
3,Made my baby spit up,I think this was starting to work but it made my daughter spit up all the time. More MIlk Plus from Mother Love worked much better for me and for her.
5,Great for increasing supply,"I bought this after my OB/GYN recommended Fenugreek to help with breastmilk production. You have to take quite a bit to see any results, but I saw results within a week. I travel for work and don't always get to keep the best pumping schedule, so I needed a bit of extra help. I am allergic to most of the other galactogogues out there (nettle, blessed thistle) so this was a great alternative."
3,caused clogged milk ducts,"This may work for others but just a couple of days after starting, it worked so well that it caused me to have FOUR clogged milk ducts. SO PAINFUL!!! Obviously everyone is different but I was only on it for four days and had to quit taking it immediately and my OB had to put me on an antibiotic. It ended up being a waste of money for me."
2,Didn't help me in my situation,"I did not notice a very big increase in supply, if at all, while using Fenugreek, even at the max dosage. I did notice a very strong scent - I smelled like maple syrup all of the time, which wasn't terrible.I've heard rave reviews of Mother's Milk [tea] and have stocked up on that for my next child, who I am currently pregnant with."
3,Not sure if this worked...,"I started taking this when my baby was about 10 months. I have been trying to make it to one year nursing. I didn't see a great increase, maybe a little. It certainly didn't hurt anything to try it. I have now stopped taking it and didn't see any difference when I stopped either. I think it's something to try if you are really wanting to continue nursing and see a decrease in your production."
3,Used to help increase milk supply while breastfeeding. Did not work.,"I purchased this item because my OBGYN recommended it in order to help increase my milk supply while breastfeeding. She recommended taking the regular dose for 5 days to increase milk production. The capsules were easy to take and they had a pleasant smell, but they didn't help increase milk production after taking for 10 days straight."
4,Seems to work,"It seems to work, not sure if it is my pump working good to keep up my milk supply or the fenugreek but it definitely makes my milk smell sweeter."
4,It Works,"It worked for me since the first day I started to use it, I was getting 30 ml everytime, but with fenugreek increased about 20 to 40 ml more, wasnt a LOT of milk, but i can say it worked. I added a tea (Mother's milk) and now my milk supply is even bigger, so i guess, pills plus tea works even better than only fenugreek pills, good luck"
4,Not sure,"I am not sure I have noticed a difference in my supply since taking these. I probably won't buy more when I run out, see if I notice a difference."
2,A let down,"I got these because I have heard about them from a lot of breastfeeding Moms. I used them for a month and noticed a very tiny increase in my supply, but for the entire month my baby pooped 6-8 times a day. She was fussy and always blowing out her diapers. I didn't make the connection at first and then decided to stop taking them, after a day she went back to pooping normally and wasn't as fussy.I was taking 2 capsules, 3 times a day. I barely noticed an increase in supply and it made my daughter very gassy and uncomfortable. I was really hoping this would help but it just didn't work for me."
4,Did the trick for me,I started taking these 3 pills 3 times a day with plenty of water and pumping and was able to stash at least 10oz or more in the freezer everyday. I'm a working mom so I pump before I leave for work and then 3-4 times during my 9hr work day and feed on demand when I'm home with my daughter. I was also drinking milkmaid tea twice a day. I'm sure if it was the combination of the two but I was very happy with the results. My freezer is overflowing with milk and I have plenty in the fridge for daycare everyday. I never had a problem with any of the side effects other complained of but I did have a break in use for about two weeks or so. I was still able to produce enough with out it but I liked the idea of stashing plenty for rainy days. I'm not a fan of the maple syrup smell in my sweat & urine though.
1,Did NOT work for me :-(,"This product got fantastic reviews, so I bought it. With my first baby, I made tons of milk, but my second one.... I can't seem to get more than 2oz. (each side). I tried pumping longer and at a higher speed. ....Nothing. I tried this out for 2 weeks. I took 2 capsules in the morning, 2 capsules in the afternoon and 2 before I went to bed. .....NO DIFFERENCE at ALL.... NONE. I was SOOOO disappointed."
2,Didn't work for me,"I read all the reviews of this product and couldn't wait to use it. I took it for over a week when my baby started to get extremely fussy. The doctor determined she had colic, changed my diet, added special formula - still was not producing enough breast milk, and took me off all vitamins. After a week, she was becoming our happy baby again. I started taking this product again and within three days she started screaming again. I immediately stopped taking this and within a few days she was back to normal. For some reason this product bothered her stomach. I did not read anything about this in any of the reviews and want to let people know this could happen to them as well."
1,Didn't Work,"Too bad, they didn't work for me; I took 3 pills 3 to 4 times/day for about 2 weeks with no results. In fact, they seemed to dry me up more, so I stopped using them. I'm going to try drinking more water and eating oatmeal..."
3,Fenugreek,i'm halfway through the bottle but I'm not too sure if it worked or not but i got heavier boobs :)
5,my students are still reviewing Shadows and Reflections during quiet reading time.,Everyday since I placed that book in my classroom library someone had read it and showed me something they liked in in the book. My class is comprised of 4-5 year olds. ivriesterer
1,Fancy wind-proof lighter for $2 is all it is,"Hi,The price tag on this thing is way over the top. It's just wind-proof lighter really. You get a cheap plastic lighter without the flint wheel and that's the ""Refillable cartridge"" This ""refillable cartridge"" goes into this cheap plastic housing unit that has some kind of fuser. It's worth $5 at best. $21.00 for this is a rip-offDO NOT BUY"
2,works fine. but only with the lighter it comes with,"I've been using this for a few weeks and it works fine. I've mastered lighting with one hand. I dialed down the flame to low to save on fuel. now all I need is some replacement fuel.EditI tried using another disposable lighter, and it would no light.I fit perfectly, i smelled the butane, but the spark would not light it.I guess the electronic spark is too weak to light the gas from another lighter"
1,"NOT white block as described, or at least mine weren't","I ordered two lots of these for use in my classroom and I needed to be able to write on them with a Sharpie, but they arrived without the white block label, so they were useless to me. I paid for the privilege of returning them though the error was not mine, so it actually cost me money for no product."
5,buena impresion,"El envio fue rapido, buen tamaño y buena reproduccion, lo envie a familiares en Cuba, quienes aprecian recordar Al Sagrado Corazon en la entrada de sus casas. Buen precio"
4,The Size,"I've been grounded lately so i've been looking up transformers stuff and i've found out thay black out is the biggest transformer, dont belive me?? go to WWW.transformersgame.com go to site then look at charactors. he should be leader size."
1,Size matters (to me),"Maybe I am thick, but I presumed, incorrectly, that this toy would have some mass to it. After all, this is the ""largest of the decepticons"". Well, color me *decepted*, because this little number is all of 12""x4""x4"".I collect all the transformers. Get Optimus prime. Size matters. To me.By the way, mine stay in the box, so please interpret the aformentioned ratings of mine for toy- fun, educational value, and durability with a grain of salt. Hmmm, next to a grain of salt, this toy might seem really large!"
4,transformers blackout,"My 7 year old son loves transformers. Sometimes we have a hard time getting them to stay together when they are in vehicle mode though, but it doesn't seem to bother him too much. Would recommend to a friend."
3,Diss-A-Pointed,"I bought other TF movie figures and then I saw the picture of this and I thought.. hmm Blackout was really friggin cool in the movie, why not get his action figure. I assumed he'd be pretty large and tower my Optimus Prime figure, buuut he looks like a friggin midget. Seriously. Why make the largest transformer the smallest voyager figure? Riddle me that. I also don't like his huge tail hanging in the back and the fact that without it the figure would topple back. The Starscream figure is waay better than this thing."
5,"An ""original"" Transfan's review.","I've been a fan of the Transformers since their U.S. debut back in 1984, and what has impressed me the most about this Movie Line is the fact the Transformers are going back to their roots.Robots In Disguise.Transformers alt modes are now that of real, authentic looking vehicles, something that has not been seen since the early 80's.Blackout was the first of this line I purchased, and I couldn't be happier.He's a little difficult to transform at first, but gets easier. For the record, the above pic is wrong, his copter blades fold neatly against his back.I can't wait for the movie to come out, it's been 23 years, welcome back."
2,Looks cool that's about it.,"My son is 5 and has quite a few Transformers and lately the ones he has gotten are all falling apart. This is not due to him playing to rough, as I too have problems keeping them together when I transform them. Pieces pop off constantly. This one is really cool looking but the propellers fall off, both black leg pieces fell off and the one of the hand covers as well as some other piece we can't figure out what it is. This generally does not effect the play of this toy however it would be nice to have it all in one piece!"
3,"Some decent lateral thinking puzzles, some out there puzzles","If you've read lateral thinking puzzle books before, this one is not much different. It's somewhat thicker than most of those books, so it has more puzzles, but it also has a few less-than-superb puzzles. The historical puzzles for the most part are trivia bits more than deductive reasoning, but they take up only a small amount of the puzzles.I'd say two out of every three puzzles are still anywhere from challenging to downright clever, which is enough for me to give it almost 2/3 of a full score."
1,This is one of the dumbest books ever written!,"This is not a book for intelligent thinking, it's a book of parlor puzzles and trivia factoids. Perhaps in a different format it could be entertaining, but as a question and answer book it just plain stinks. Sample question: A man went into his local shopping center. A woman whom he had never met before wished him a happy birthday. How did she know it was his birthday?The ""Answer"": The man went to an eye doctor to have an eye test. The doctor looked at his record and noticed that today was his birthday.I had to flip pages to find this nugget of an answer! I want my money back for the time I spent looking at this book!"
2,Johnny Winter Live in the 80s,"Not as good as I was led to believe by other reviews. It was ok, notgreat. I am a Johnny Winter fan and like some of his video."
5,excellent!,just got my copy today! man it's excellent! can't wait for more releases hopefully in the not to distant future! keep on rockin' the blues! sincerely;-a fan- jeff brisson
2,Poor Quality DVD,Was so excited to get Johnny Winters Live through the 80's. Very disappointed with the quality. It is a copy and not original. The video is very poor but the sound is okay. When you look at the DVD you can tell by the burn lines that it is a copy/fake. Not blaming the seller necessarily could be the company that produced it. Don't waste your money on this.
2,Repackaged?,"This lens arrived with nothing in the package aside from the lens and the pouch for the lens. No instructions, no adaptor rings. It is useless to me as I have a 58 mm Canon lens. I have had to reorder another fisheye lens and some adaptors. Product was not shipped by Amazon so returning it is tricky."
3,Decent enough product,"Decent enough ... but I didn't find it very useful as the corners of the photos get chopped off at wide-angles, and I'm not a huge fan of the fish-eye look. I bought it for underwater photography but didn't end up using it much. Does the job though."
2,GARBAGE,Screwed onto my JVC GY-HD7 and i get barrel distortion. If this thing was made for a 46mm mount then whomever designed it shot be shot........
5,Love it,"I wanted a wide angle lens to add to my ""creative"" arsenal and get me to see things differently...this lens was so inexpensive compared to true fisheye lenses...and I have just made some test shots with this lens and all I can say is that I am going to have a lot of fun with it. And so far as just the ""macro"" part does... I really can't believe how close you can get to an object...very cool."
5,Perfect for fujifilm or JVC,I used it for mi photo camera fujifilm s700 and my camcorder jvc. The image is very clear. Wide angle shoots work perfect
3,Bower,It's pretty good for the price but makes my photos and videos have less details and more out of focus
4,a half descent split,"this is a half descent split due to the fact the agraphobic nosebleed cannot come close to keeping up with the metal/core veterans converge who have been making brutal music with the addition of supprising melodies,drumachine, and some of the best lyrics in the genere not your typical band. while i do not know to much about agraphobic nosebleeds past. the songs on this release aside being produced poorly are not at all impressive.this cd is still worth listening to. the artwork is incredible so minus a few not good tracks this is an increidble release very much worth your time and money.noteable tracks: locust reign, devastator, they strechted for miles"
4,at the center of the hive,"I feel like this release is both bands strongest.1.Probably the longest ANb songs you will get - plus JR Hayes (Pig Destroyer) does a lot of the vocals.2. The production is very good considering3. My Great Devastator - probably the most copied and influential songs ever. Try finding a band who plays ""metalcore"" or whatever it's called these days, that doesnt sound like that.You dont really need all of the other Converge albums, even though they are good, because you have all of their songs in one.Bad thing here is the artwork on the inside, the cover art is great, and trying to find this cd... it was tough for me.Buy this as soon as you can if you like either band - don't buy On Broken Wings or The Acacia Strain..."
3,karaoke feature required for pure listining pleasure,"well first of all i am not at all a fan of ANB, so lets just skip straight to the converge half. the best part of this disc was the addition of the new bassist and drummer. Nate, though not an exceptional bass player has a heck of a voice. his singing is the only thing vocally worthwhile. Jake's vocals sound as bad as ever, the band should let nate take over. the riffs on this thing were outstanding, and the drumming was a 100% improvement over the last releases. the layout is pretty horrible. i give it only a 3 because i hate the vocals, and ANB is just plain silly. so, buy it, skip the ANB half, try to tune (or EQ) jake completely out, and enjoy an otherwise fine release."
3,Agraphobic noseblee basically ruined this album !,"As you can see i gave 3 starts for the simply fact that agraphobic nosebleed had parts on this album!...I'm sorry but converge is the true defenition of heavy not agraphobic nosebleed alright?! The converge side is way better with great songs like ""this is mine"" , ""they stretch for miles"" , "" my great devestator"" and my personal favorite, ""the human shield"" along with the rest of converge's side!! I quess this album would have been 5 starts if agraphobic Nosebleed was not in it...Later!"
3,I'm more hardcore than you.,"Neither band are great, but neither band suck. If you've listened to this genre a lot you'll recognise that it's mostly the same old stuff but so what ... it shreds."
4,thanksgiving dinner,"you know what, usually agoraphobic nosebleed mash my ear drums and then eat them for dinner. but this time around, my ear drums are not mashed and i think that agoraphobic nosebleed (ANb from here on in) are just having grilled cheese for dinner. i mean don't get me wrong, ANb usually makes me feel like a little girl (in the good way), but this time, not so much.HOWEVER converge turned my mashed ear drums into a whole thanksgiving feast. like i am talking turkey, mashed potatoes, corn, brussel sprouts and everything. my grandma and grandpa were there. it was amazing. i used to think that you fail me was converge at their hungriest, but their performance on this split shows that these guys are starving and would most likely chew on your face if you let them. i recommend letting them."
5,Awesome......,"This band is the future of punk rock.... or should I say, the future of rock and roll. This EP is so great. I agree with the other review, that it is better than Songs for Cruising (Which was still great, but not as consistant) I heard a new song on their web site thefairlanes.com and it is amazing as well. I hope they come through my town because I have heard that they rock live."
4,Ezra Taft Benson,It is refreshing to hear the words and life of a living prophet.I could not put down the book. Recommended for all age readers.
2,What it leaves out would be more interesting,"Spencer Kimball's son and grandson set the gold standard for LDS biography with their candor. Sheri ""I have an obligation not to be objective"" Dew aimed for fool's gold. She not only left many things out, she also deliberately took other things out of context, all in the name of a favorable impression."
1,The author is brilliant,"Making Ezra Taft Benson sound inspired is quite a task. Here is a guy who thought that Joseph McCarthy was a great American, who preached from General Conference promoting the uber right-wing nonsense of the John Birch Society and was a highly divisive figure within the Mormon hierarchy.As a prophet, his emphasis (while he still had 40% of his faculties) was to stress the reading of ""The Book of Marmon."" So his legacy is to ask people to read a book that teaches that God curses people for their unrighteousness by turning their skin dark. Just wonderful. Not to mention the fact that the Book of Mormon is not what the author claims it was. Soundly refuted by DNA, linguistic and archeological evidence, Ezra Taft Benson put that document as the most important document in Mormonism. Talk about putting all your wares on a dead horse (or was it a tapir)."
2,Who Gonna Stop Nature?,"Yes this is so sad but nature has alway did something fearful to planet earth.As far as the women saying she crawl into her apartment which was fill with some amount of water, then no way could the health department let people move back in for all kind of health reasons.I live in a State where the water and moisture make walls sweat so you must have a humidifier."
1,"Even though this movie was free with Amazon Prime, I still feel ripped off.","This movie had the potential to be fantastic (the subject matter was there). Instead, the director thought it best to work on a narrowly focused political agenda. I thought once he got past that the story line would move along and you would get testimonies from different people of different backgrounds that were affected in different ways by the hurricane. Nope, he repeated the same political themes, interviewed people with the same sentiments and offered no good solutions to the problems at hand. The only part worth seeing was the gentleman from LSU. I'd like to see him do a documentary with a better film maker... heck he could probably do better with a Flip cam himself."
3,Very Laura Antoniou,A collection of short stories of varying orientation by one of the better woman writers of erotica.
3,hard to install,the installation instructions are hard to understand. i have been working on automobiles for 30 + years and i still do not have the install figured out. i did get the day time running lamps to work but the auto head lights are still not working. a good foot note for the instructions would be to tell people if you do not want a particular option do not use ignition wire connection or donot use orange wire if you do not want to hook to security system.
5,Excellent product,"I installed this unit on my 94"" Accord.Installation:Took couple hours to locate right connection points. Another hour to remove existing old broken alarm system (which, if functional, was compatible with this unit). Spent another 90 minutes to connect harnesses, relays, sensor, switch.Functionality:I was able to get high beams to work correctly (despite all other reviews). Since my car had no electronics tied to lighting circuit, I used supplied relays to override parking/light combination switch. Unit delays switching ON for a few seconds to allow you start the car without extra load on battery. Switching ON is instant in dark areas. Switching OFF delayed by 10-15 seconds - likely to avoid false flashing.Notes:Unit, relays and sensor are very good quality.As already noted, on/off switch looks awful. Mine also had On/Off labels flipped. Not a big deal, will replace it with something better looking.Summary:Fantastic product. Avoid installing yourself - take your car to alarm shop."
1,Wasted reputation,"I have used an Olympus C-3000Z (expensive) camera since year 2000. It is a wonderful camera that has taken over 50,000 pictures. So I get the significant other an FE-100 knowing it is a low-end camera. It is basically useless! The battery problem mentioned by several reviewers is much worse than they say. With fresh non-rechargable batteries, you may only get a half-dozen pictures before it won't even turn on. Rechargables only work right off the charger, and then not for long. I did the first software upgrade that was supposed to help this problem, but it made little difference. On the rare occasion that you can use the camera, in full daylight it makes quite good pictures. In low light, forget it whether you use flash or not. I don't understand why Olympus would waste a sterling reputation on this Chinese piece of trash. I have been thinking of buying a new good camera, but I probably won't risk getting more such junk from Olympus."
2,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"At first I thought that this camera was wonderful BUT it has a lot of things wrong with it...1. It is NOT for fast picture taking, it takes a lot of time for the shutter to close!2. If you don't have an arm made of stone then you will get extremely blurry night shots.3. Goes through battery EXTREMELY quickly4. There is a very slow rebooting time between shots5. Zoom is choppy and hard to use6. Only some of the photos come out when uploaded7. Without the flash the pictures are very, very blurryBut this camera is extremely easy to use just take it out of the box and use it."
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this camera 5 months ago . I used it only thrice. Took a total of 13 shots. Handled it gentle. The camera lid cover was not holding after 2nd use. The batteries kept dropping. I had to put a tape on the lid to keep the batteries in.I mailed it to Olympus service in Cypress, CA. They tell me that is not covered under warrenty and I have to pay 83 dollars for repir. I told them to discard it as it is not worth even the postage.I lost all my money.I felt the camera is of poor quality and not worth even a dime."
2,Unacceptably slow shutter,"I ordered this based on good reviews here and low price, and because my much older Olympus had been stolen. But after trying it for less than 5 minutes it was back in the box to be returned, even though I burn thirty bucks on the return. This camera makes the cardinal sin of having an enormous (2 to 2.5 second) delay between (a) when you press the button and (b) actually taking the picture. In this respect this camera is slower than my phone camera, and even slower than the 4-year-old 2.1M Olympus I had, amazingly. If you are taking pictures of people who are moving (i.e. anybody who is not posing), and you are trying to capture the moment, this mis-feature will be frustrating for the life of the camera. I'm really puzzled why people would like this camera, unless they are mostly taking pictures of scenery or of people posing."
1,Could this book be more religious?,"The overall content of the book isn't that bad, but the continuous references to God is annoying for someone who isn't religious. Lines such as ""Make your marriage better by at the end of the day giving your problems to God"" are not helpful to those of us that aren't religious. These comments by the author get worse and worse through the book to the point where I just gave up reading it."
5,k & H small thermo perch,"My cockatiel loves it. You have peace of mind knowing that your bird is warm. The size is a bit different that other brands, the small one looks more like medium, take measurement before you buy it. I would buy it again!"
2,Keeps breaking.,"It's already a really cool product but it would be a fantastic product, if it was made of stronger stuff.My family has a blue & gold and we have gone through 3 perches because they keep breaking with him on it. The plastic connector keeps cracking because it's made of thin plastic. It should be made out of the same material as the perch itself. Or better yet, metal. All other perches come with a metal connecter, why is this one plastic?"
1,Not the Greatest,"We bought two of these perches. One for a cockatoo and one for a yellow collard macaw. Iinstalled these as per the instructions. The wires are in a metal shield so the birds cant get to the low voltage wire within the shield. The cockatoo's cage has larger openings then the smaller bird. She ripped the wire out in 2 minutes flat shield and all, rendering this item useless!"
4,"Good product, fickle bird.","The Thermo Perch is exactly as promised and does precisely what you'd think. The only problem so far has been getting my cockatiel to acknowledge its presence. (So far she's alternated between refusing to look at it and stepping over it with great disdain...) However, even though she won't actually sit on it, it does help keep that part of her cage a little toastier than the rest of the room, which is good. It would be much improved if there was a dial to allow adjustment; I think she'd like it better if I could turn the temperature down a bit. As it stands, I'm going to try covering part of it in strips of bird-safe cloth or leather to make it a bit cooler and hopefully more popular."
1,Don't order Parrot products From Amazon,"I ordered this item a few minutes ago, realized it was the wrong size, and now can't modify the order! This will damage my parrots feet at this size. I'm never ordering from Amazon again."
2,My bird was able to chew the cord.,"I was hoping this perch would work for my Umbrella Cockatoo but unfortunately no matter what we did, she was able to stick her foot out and grab it to chew. She ruined it in two days. Amazon was amazing with the return though. No hassle!"
4,little slip but good product,"I got e this product ( small size) for 3month old my baby Green cheek conure ,He stand on heat perch little bit and looks warm and nice but i think he looks little slip because perch is plastic."
2,"Good, not Great","The surface of this perch is too slippery and my parrot has difficulty gripping it- after a few attempts, he now refuses to stand on it. Wish it had been less smooth and more textured. He still sits NEXT to it when cold, but not ON it."
1,Item broke under the weight of my Macaw,Had perch in box for a few months. Then it broke after a few weeks when my Blue & Gold Macaw was sitting on it. Tried to contact seller due to poor manufacturing but they failed to respond. I have smaller perches for my other parrots without any issues.
2,Perches are OK. There is nothing else available.,"The perch is nice and has a graduated heating area. (Warmer on outer end, cooler toward area where it is connected to the cage). We did have a problem with the electrical box, but the manufacturer sent us a new one free. It just stopped working! I am NOT happy with how they connect it to the cage. We have parrots and we have to be careful with wiring stuff. It needs to be better secured into the area around the connector on the cage. It would not take much to dip that end into plastic and seal the end."
2,Faulty Adapter,"My senior cockatiel (30 years old) took his time ""warming up"" to this perch but then he loved it. Problem is it works for a while and then dies. I've changed the adapter a couple of times. I don't know if I should purchase another one with the problems this product has presented."
2,The protection on the cable is useless,"I have 2 units of this product, the small bird enjoined a lot, but my big birds destroy the cable on the are with protection, I was so easy to do it for her, the material used to protect the cable is weak, and don;t work with big birds, the Adaptor when bad after that and is impossible for me to find the same Adaptor because is AC-AC transformer, so now in less the a week the product don't work and the store don't sell just the Adaptor. I hope this review help somebody to don;t waste their money."
1,Slippery and cheap plastic,I have medium and large birds and used correct sized perches. Two of my birds tried to perch so that I could scratch them through the cage and they slipped off. Very little texture and I did not like the thin plastic collar that is used on the inside to attatch to the cage.
3,Great untill it broke,"This was a great product when it was working. It was nice to pick up our macaw and her feet would be warm. It appeared she liked the perch because she stood on it even though she had other places to perch. It lasted one winter, maybe two. The other day I noticed it was loose. When I tried to tighten it, the wire twisted off. It is now junk. I suppose I am purchasing another for poor Goober simply because I cant find a better one, although there is obviously a design flaw. (the threaded area is weak). This time I will build a brace to support the outer end."
5,GREAT if your room temp's not always perfect....,"Our ""bird room"" (spare bedroom) sometimes gets a little cool, esp in the winter, and I would often turn on a space heater in the room to warm things up, which can be dangerous if left on accidentally all day (which I have done) and simply costly if left on for long periods of time. So this is perfect - if she gets cool, she simply goes to her perch and warms up (since their feet are where they lose heat)! Oh, but BE SURE TO KEEP THE CORD WELL AWAY FROM THE CAGE, as (despite the metal coils around the cord extending about 5-6 inches away from the cage) she STILL managed to get at the cord somehow and chew through the first one we bought - luckily she did not get hurt!"
2,disappointed,My cockatoo was able to chew through the protection around the cord and there is no way to replace the cord! I guess I am lucky he was not electrocuted though!
5,Build a Better Nation,"I loved this book! Not quite as good as the last book, ""Help, Mom, There Are Jews in the Attic!"", but still a great jump-start program for getting the youth involved in the party. Can't wait to read the forthcoming ""Daddy, Come Quick, There Are Coons in the Garage!"""
5,Bought it.,Anything that makes liberals mad is worth taking a look at....Got a copy for our family just now.
5,Cute,"I've read a copy and it's a cute story that adults will like as well.If Hillary Clinton and her minions keep yapping on about the book, pretty soon it'll be a best seller.And, for those reviewers who feign indignation about this book -calling it a ""divisive"" and ""political"" children's book -- perhaps you missed the sale of ""No, George, No!,"" ""The Three Little Pigs Buy the White House,"" and ""The George W. Bush Coloring Book,"" to name only a few of the less insulting titles, on sale at Amazon and prominently displayed at most bookstores.Liberals were the first to force their political agenda into every aspect of life - including child rearing, teaching, and children's books. If President Bush is fair game in the children's book market, so are Hillary, Ted Kennedy and the rest of the liberal Democrats."
2,"Worth a laugh, certainly not for children","This book claims to support conservative values. There are a plenty of good conservative values that are worthy of children's books: love of family, love of God, love of country. This book does not do a very good job of teaching any values at all. It really is just a semi-comedic chant: ""Liberals are BAD,"" over and over."
1,This is Creepy,"This is the kind of garbage that makes me embarrassed to be a conservative. Degrading the opposition is the rule of sport in American politics, of course, but this reminds me of the type of propaganda taught to Hitler's Youth. Gross. Both parties need to grow up!"
1,Just when you thought it couldn't get any lower....,"These kids are going to go to school with a message they don't understand and get involved with controversy when they should be arguing whether they are safe at first in the kickball game. What a shame that people won't let their kids be kids anymore. The book seems funny as a political satire but to target kids is too much. There is a special hell for those who do this. Later in life they will feel very, very foolish for having gotten involved in this level of political manipulation."
1,Narrow you child's mind. Buy this book.,"I didn't buy this book but I flipped through it at Barnes and Noble. It's pedestrian, acidic, badly written and illustrated and full of misleading and distorted generalizations. In other words, it's perfect for the conservative family. This book will give the conservative child the proper training to become kool-aid drinkers like their parents. It will also close their minds faster than George Bush can ""milk"" a stallion!"
1,How very low must we go!,"It's bad that we throw around terms like Liberial and Conservative to without really understanding what they mean but to make a kiddy book about this shows the lack of any moral standard of the Author or the publisher. This is worse than any thing I have ever seen. Rather than devote a book to explaining the principals that she lives by or presenting them in a way that would be seen as ""educational"" she makes a book with a title that's just begging for people to be offened or worse excited. Do your kids and the world a favor, encurage them to be honest, truthful, accountable for thier actions & kind to each other and political lables will not get in the way of being a better person, you adults can learn that to !"
1,The Right Becomes More Out of Touch and Even More Extreme!,"It must be nice sitting home in your mansion and have the time to write a book about liberals, who actually fought for this country, while you were sitting on your ranch, doing nothing, but spouting your hate-filled nonsense. It must be nice to be part of the 34% who still support Bush and the Republicans.The party that put up the likes of Reagan, Schwarzenegger, and Sonny Bono, really have nerve trying to paint a picture of Hollywood having no business being political. We didn't put a D-list actor who had no idea about politics in the White House. Now go back and listen to that walking drug fiend Rush Limbaugh, or that pervert Bill O'Reily."
1,Envision the title just a bit differently...,"I just learned of this book today so have not yet had a chance to read it. I will. In the meantime, I have to ask, would we find it just as ""humorous"" to give 4 year old children this book if it were entitled ""Help! Mom! There are Christians Under My Bed!"" Somehow I think that would never be published.... But maybe I should write it and see..."
1,Just what we need,"Give your child a copy of this and The Handmaid's Tale and let them form their own conclusions about what is right in this world. Jesus on every corner, no taxes to fix roads or schools, and no rights for women. What a wonderful world!"
1,Buy this book if you like your opinions spoon-fed.,"So this is what conservatives have to do to perpetuate the myth of the ""evil liberals"". Despite the fact that power in the USA is firmly in the hands of conservatives - they continue to whine that all society's ills are caused by liberals. Poor babies. Unfortunately the book is a sorry little piece of political propaganda that does not mention that the current administration has produced the largest expansion of govt. spending since WWII. The fact that the budget deficit is ballooning out of control is also not mentioned. Keep teaching ignorance conservatives - you are only handicapping your children."
1,Disturbing to say the least,"My God, what are people teaching their kids these days? To fear and hate people different from them? I would never teach my child to fear a conservative. Heck, I would never talk politics to my child EVER! Kids should be reading about sharing, kindness to others, and acceptance. Not discrimination. As far as I'm concerned, this book might as well be about burning crosses on people's lawns. If this were written 50 years ago it would be titled ""Help! Mom! There are Blacks Under my Bed!"" This is a hate filled book and I feel sorry for the child that is stuck with the parent reading this trash to them."
5,Sometimes the truth hurts,"It's nice to finally get a book in our children's hands that doesn't promote socialism, homosexuality and other devient forms of behavior and actually describes what the liberal left is too ashamed to say out loud - what they actually believe and promote.I plan on purchasing several for our local schools and see if they will put them on the shelves with stories of gay kings and children with ""two mommies'."
1,feeding hate and poison to children is disgusting and weak,"We need wider understanding, cooperation and critical thinking in coming generations if America is not to be torn apart and self-destruct for the most banal and avoidable of behavior patterns.This book is completely counter to such goals and is probably driven as much by a desire to make profit via sensationalism and controversy as it is the desire by adults to further their own selfish, myopic inflexibility at the expense of clean, bright, trusting little minds. Such behavior by adults not only sets a horrible example, it is pathetic and cowardly."
1,Disgusting,"Let's teach hate to our children. Oh no, wait, even better, let's get them involved with the political process before they can tie their shoe laces! This author should be ashamed of herself for this crap. I agree with the reviewer who said if there was a zero rating, that would be more appropriate for this garbage."
1,Bigoted Nonsense,"The individuals who wrote this book felt it was appropriate for children because the authors are extremely childish themselves. However, this book is not at all appropriate for children, or even most adults. Quite simply, this book is bigoted and ignorant, and is designed to incite hatred.It is unfortunate that there are people who would write things like this to begin with, it's even more unfortunate that there are people unintelligent enough to buy a copy of it."
2,A testament to a divided America,"This is the type of book that I shudder to think of. Some parts are pretty funny, but it just goes to show you how divided our country really is. I feel ashamed to be a conservative now."
1,"Putting aside the politics, it just isn't funny","It isn't ""brilliant"" either. It's juvenile. What children's book isn't? Yet its subject matter is entirely inappropriate for children (as several of those who praise it acknowledge), who couldn't understand it in any meaningful way. Political satire has its place, but a children's book is not the place, and this is bad political satire. The illustrations are no better than could be found in almost any children's book. Those who are giving this book 5 stars seem to be basing it on nothing other than their political sentiments."
5,Outstanding! My Kids' Favorite Scary Bedtime Story,"As both a parent and an economics teacher, I cannot recommend this book highly enough! The Truth is in Here! My sons want me to read them this book every night before bed. It tops my Christmas shopping list this year, for both children and adults."
3,Witty yet a bit off,"This book will do well as a very approachable medium for parents to teach children about the ""dangers"" of liberalism. The only problem is that this book seems to teach children that liberals are bad by using gross over-generalizations and stereotyping. Instead of liberal bashing, or conservative bashing books for that matter, why not something bi-partisan so the children can learn the facts, not the opinions and then decide for themselves? I fear that this book does more to instigate contempt than it does to promote the truth"
3,Astounding,"I'm a liberal and ...a) I don't care if you put up a cross in your home or business - just on property for which I pay taxes. I don't proselytize, even when Christians do.b) I don't care if you eat your broccoli or not. I'd like everyone to have the OPTION of eating something other than junk food. But how they exercise that option is outside my interest.c) Nobody is asking anyone who makes $12 a year to pay half their money in taxes.Keep eating your hate, folks. It's making America weaker."
2,This is the best they could do?,"Pretty ham handed and really not that clever. While I would expect this level of cleverness from a liberal lampoon of the conservatives, I was hoping for more in this effort."
3,"Cute, but not worth the price.","I recently purchased this book for my daughter. I consider myself for the most part, conservative.If you would like to be black and white about things, there are books on both side of the pollitical spectrum that would serve you well to have your children read, and if you're a hard-core conservative, then you'd appreciate this one. I however, wanted more of a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek book that doesn't beat you about the head with how bad people on the left are. I was hoping for a happier ending, (you know, that monsters under the bed aren't real). This book just wanted to bash. It was like reading the editorial comics in the Los Angeles Times.I believe there are a lot of intelligent people on the right AND on the left. Could we please have a few books that show it? This book just makes the right look petty and spiteful, I thought we were bigger than that."
2,smh,"I'm neither liberal nor conservative but somewhere in the middle and a friend of mine got this for my niece as she is a staunch conservative. My sister-in-law and I read it and decided to not have her daughter read it. I think that the story is actually good in the fact that it does make one think about how the government can affect someone. However, we both didn't like the fact that it really did try to demonize one side of the party spectrum with broad strokes. Any kind of media that tries overly hard to make one political side look like the ""bad guy"" just isn't doing it's job. I didn't find it offensive because it disparaged dems. I found it sad that one side would try to scare their kids into thinking of a certain political party as a monster. Give kids ALL the facts about both parties and let them decide. Don't use scare tactics."
1,What the hell?,"Holy hell, this is real? What kind of retarded country actually allows this sort of thing to be sold to kids?America... you make me sick. Remind me never to raise a child there.And this isn't about the political leaning of the views in the book... pro lib, anti lib, I don't care. Children shouldn't be exposed to this."
1,Typical Pointless Conservative Hatemongering and Very Offensive,"Ted Kennedy's Car Wash? Honestly? You're making fun of someone DROWNING? That's just totally unnecessary. I know the conservatives are trying to start converting the children to hatemongering when they're not even old enough to read anything bigger than a picture book, but honestly, this is a new low."
1,History repeats itself?,"When was the last time I saw a series of books like this? hmmm...OH! Now I remember! How can we forget the classic lines of childrens books by Der Sturmer with such heart warming titles like ""Trau keinem Fuchs auf grunner Heid und keinem Jud auf seinem Eid"" (Trust no Fox on his green heath and Trust no Jew on his Oath).I would also suggest trying to read past one sentence of these very poorly written books. They are difficult for adults to get through let alone children.The entire concept for this line of books would be funny if the wasn't so scary and sad."
1,Conservatives could do better than this,"The sad thing is that this book starts out as a perfectly respectable lesson in self-sufficiency, a lesson more kids could use these days. Then from there it just gets silly, reading like a parody of hackneyed anti-liberal talking points.Frankly, I find this kind of political child indoctination (not just conservatism, I've seen environmentalists and black-nationalists do this too) to be, well, kind of creepy... I think a lot of conservatives must find this whole thing a bit gauche as well.It seems like conservatives can easily convey their values in a more subtle, less partisan, more age-appropriate way. But of course, if the authors had actually made a good book, designed for kids and not their parents, it probably wouldn't have sold nearly as much as it did."
1,"I wouldn't waste my money, but the thought makes me laugh.",So Tommy and Lou move out of Liberaland to a place with no taxes. While playing on the swing set they purchased with their tax free earnings Tommy falls off and breaks his arm; unfortunately there is no health coverage for children outside of Liberaland either.This is pretty amusing.
5,I'm buying 2 right now,"YES there are a few conservatives here in the People's Republic of Oregon.. funny how liberals never complain about their brainwashing propaganda flooding classrooms, but when someone makes a book for sale in the private market, well that's just unacceptable. (Rush quote) They overlook that no one is being forced to read this. You have to buy it. I have not read the book yet, but it sounds to me like everything in it is true. Is it wrong to target children? Well, is it wrong to try to remove God and anything supporting America from schools? Is it wrong to tell them that it's ok to be gay or smoke pot or have underage premarital sex? Is it wrong to destroy every tradition in school (Christmas, Halloween) until it comes to promoting ""tolerance"" for Islam? I would say that one book that you have to choose to buy pales in comparison to the things liberals get away with thanks to their buddies in the ACLU."
5,"I'm buying several to give to relatives! A great, funny read!","I'm a recovering liberal, so those writing the negative reviews, I KNOW what you're doing. You didn't read the book, but because you believe you own the 'truth, the light and the only way' your humor bone is missing or terribly deformed.This book is a wonderfully funny, light hearted, but spirited poke at politics as we know them. It brings home things that we have become complacent about...the purpose of the government and the misconception that it is a surrogate mother.That it's supposed to tell us all what to do, when to do it and how often. In other words, true freedom means being left alone.....With no liberals under your bed ;)"
2,Playing politics with children,"It's a clever book to be sure, but let's face it: The author was smart for writing a children's book that gets adults talking (and buying). Do you think we'd all be here if this were a book about a choo-choo train or a dolphin?Bottom line: Makes for amusing reading -- if you don't mind putting up with the deliberately childish, grossly ridiculous, and insulting stereotypes. If any of you seriously believe this partisan hack-job is an appropriate way to help your children understand the world around them, though, God help us all."
1,Centrist can recognize hate literature,"I'm neither a liberal nor conservative. My thoughts and beliefs are not governed by a political party. With open eyes, I can recognize hate in all of its forms.Katharine DeBrecht and Al Franken are fruits of the same tree. Teach your kids to hate and I will question your ability to parent.This books teaches kids to label others and treat those that fit the label in a hateful manner.I am always astounded at the complete lack of Christianity among so-called Christians. Jesus taught love and tolerance at every opportunity. This book teaches intolerance and hate and is anti-Christian in the most fundamental way."
1,A better title would be: IT'S OKAY TO HATE -- Is this what you want to teach your kids?,"Saw this at the home of an acquaintance and I almost threw up. What a waste of the printed page. Buy this book only if you want to teach your children to be fearful, hostile, prejudiced, mean, arrogant, sarcastic, petty and irrational. What a sad world this will be if children are taught to shirk personal responsibility and blame others for their problems as this book attempts to do. Don't waste your hard-earned money. Could do much more harm than good."
2,Meh!,"I only heard of the book from the political board of a game site.The conservative members were laughing that a humor book was upsetting liberals.I finally found it in book store and gave it a read.All I can say is meh! The ""humor"" is weak at best as it appears to be targeted for a select group of people. I like a good joke and our politicians are usually good for endless fun. However, this book did not even make me chuckle.As a kids book; would they really get the economic lessons that are attempted in it? Or is this simply a tool for conservatives to teach their children about the ""evil"" liberals?As proof to the fact I read it for the others that did. Mayor Leech and the LCLU are in it. The Mayor looks like Ted Kennedy and I don't have to explain the LCLU ;) Let's not forget Senetor Clunckton.The artwork is ok.Again, I think this book is aimed at a select group of people rather then making fun for all. I went ""meh"" after reading it. You could probably find something better so save your money."
1,This is just sick,"Good way to bring your children up being closed minded neo-con zombies! We(that is the working class Mr limbaugh) Allready pay a ""socialist "" share of taxes and heres the rub...we dont get any benefit from them! Why? because our taxes go to fund corporate welfare programs, our oversized military-industrial complex(now made in china. tm) and basicaly to mismanage the lions share of the worlds GDP. This kinda of BULL-PUCKY makes me sick. Avoid like you would the limbaugh plague(it makes you do closed minded,dumb,and and hooks you on vicodin too)"
1,Why do conservatives always claim liberals didn't read the book?,"I did read this book! Garbage is Garbage!!! Why would anyone want to teach their children to be so narrow minded and superior. For people who want their world to be like this, may I recommend reading your children the Koran instead and moving to Iran!! Iran doesn't have Jesus like this book, but everything else is right up your alley!"
1,Forces homosexuality on your children! Be careful!,"I gave this book to my aunt carol and uncle steve and they read it to their kids. Now they are divorced, Steve is married to someone named Tim and when the kids come to our house they wear earrings and pink stretch pants and don't pray at the table.This is all this books fault, you are destroying America you sickos! Why not give it all to the redcoats?"
1,Can I give this Zero stars?,"This is a kid's book? I think the only kid invovled with this book is the writer. Say what you will about kids' books and whether they're too liberal or not, but they're usually not this blatant. I don't think many kids want to read about tax cuts or tort reform. Try again with an actual kids book."
1,Ugly,"Ugly drawings, ugly thoughts. Great for mean, sick people who want to encourage their children to hate those with alternative views."
5,"I Love the Movie ""All About Us""","I was not aware of Michael and Christine Swanson's work before seeing this movie. I loved the movie because it was so real and inspiring. It encourages the audience never to give up on your dreams and to live in the moment, cherishing each moment. And the touching interaction between this young couple is inspirational. I love to see more movies like this that shows real true life of a positive role model for all Americans. Depicting American blacks as intelligent, ambitious, creative, progressive individuals with strong family values; strong work ethics and loving relationships; is so need in today's society. I can't wait to see their first movie ""All About You"", and looking forward to their next movie."
2,All About Us,Did not like. Story line severely lacking. There was a good premise: Promising playwright takes road trip to hunt down famous actor to star in his movie.Too many missteps from original premise of movie.
1,Boring!!,"Okay so i bought the movie because first of all it had Boris Kodjoe on the cover :) and I knew he starred in it. And, most of the films he's in are usually good ones!! But this one was SLOW + BORING!!!!!!! I only watched it twice.. First time I didn't like it so I tried watching it again to see if it was just me but nope, still BORING!! The ONLY reason I didn't mind watching it is because of Boris Kodjoe.. Other than that thumps waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy down!!"
1,Boring movie,"I did not enjoy this movie at all, found it pretty boring. The story line is pretty boaring, don't recommend it at all, in other words don't waste your money on it."
2,boring...,"i'm not usually very picky with my movies... i'm pretty accepting of bad ones... which is why i tried to stay up to finish the movie... fell asleep about halfway through (fighting to stay awake). the next morning, finished it, the entire time waiting for some resolution... no climax... just dragged on and on... at the end, i wondered how this ever made it to film...??? sorry, but me no like. (but the actor is really nice to look at!)"
1,All about us,"This movie was about another movie called ""All About You"". The story line was not good. I wasted my money. I would not recommend buying this movie."
3,Gloryhorn,"This DVD was somewhat disappointing. The story line did not keep my interest. I saw ""All About You' which was a great movie and the story line was great."
1,all about nothing,"How do you write a bad movie, about an experience shopping another bad movie?? I turned this off after about 30 minutes. It was sooo boring. Even the fine-ness of Boris Kodjoe could not save it."
1,Didn't Like It :(,"Sorry but I got this movie for my mom because of the reviews I read but I did not like this movie. It dragged on, I almost fell asleep on it 3 times."
3,"A good collection of information, but needs more detail",This is probably the best book on specifically Los Caobs that you'll find...but it is lacking some usefull details. Maybe if it wasn't a pocket version...
2,"Holy cow, it blew up my glass!","I used this cleaner on all sorts of glass and was happy with it's performance, until I used it on the glass shelf in my entertainment center. Upon spraying the product I heard an immediate crackling noise and then a few seconds later the glass exploded! I actually cut myself on one of the flying pieces. Just a warning, I'm not sure what types of glass (different glass is made from different materials) will react with the cleaner, so proceed with caution..."
5,Life-changing... in the really good way,"This is my first review on Amazon.com. I feel it's necessary to say that because I've read a lot, watched a lot, purchased a lot, and this is the first book to inspire me to put fingers to keys and tap out an actual review. I won't share too much more personally, but this book is life-changing- in the good way, of course. There are so many reviews out there that remind you that no one book can solve everything. I have to disagree. A Language of the Heart can fix it all... because it fixes the way you think. In this book you are reminded that you are perfect just the way you are (and it explains just what that means), how to protect yourself and others from anger (the most useless emotion of all), how our past shapes who we are today (but in a totally non-victim non-blaming kind of way), and the value in allowing yourself to be sad.It's so tiny... yet so powerful."
5,Cookies,Loved this book 35 years ago and now purchased for my daughter. Best variety of Christmas Cookies and lots of memories.
3,Not Edward's Best Book,"I have enjoyed all of Cassie Edward's books; however, this one was a complete disappointment. The book was comprised of short choppy sentences, no suspense, not really a real plot. Everything was just too pat and some of the dialogue was strictly written on a junior high school leve. This is the only book by Edwards that was a total disappointment."
3,Great story,I thought that this was a great story. It is very rare that You have someone in a wheelchair be a heroine with a love story. It proves that true love can happen when you least expect it. you just need to courage to try.
5,EXCELLENT!,I THOUGHT THE PLOT OF THIS BOOK WAS TRULY AMAZING! I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN EVEN JUST FOR A MINUTE. THE STORY ABOUT WOLF AND JOSEPHINE WAS BREATHTAKING AND WEEL-WRITTEN! I WILL RECAMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO LIKES BOOKS.
4,You cannot miss this!,"Hordes of the Underdark takes you on a long beautifull journey; it is the Bioware game you always wanted, while The Shadows of Undrentide could be for some somehow a disappointment, with this game you do not take that risk . In quality, it's up there with classics like the Baldur's Gate and Diablo games.Nice Prestige Classes and the ability to advance to ""Epic"" levels, nice in game items.There is a good Mac community on the Bioware site, a lot of modules made by players and Bioware, guarantees you tons of hours of playing.A must have in my opinion.Remember this is an expansion."
2,Disappointing,"This book did not live up to its promise. Though there was a lot of good information - a lot of ""mythbusting"" - it neither broke new ground nor proved all that ""reader-friendly"" for a popular presentation. There were a number of silly factual errors, including referring to the Tao Te Ching by the name of its reputed author, Lao Tzu (as though the latter were the title!).The heavy use of charts really slowed it down it the portion on witchcraft, and I didn't see any particular value in having them there rather than in an Appendix."
1,What about Witches?,"Mmmm, the whole witch hunting being stopped becuase Christians protested the abuse, etc.? That's about the dumbest thing I've ever heard! It was christianity in the first place that stared it, the whole they belive in the devil thing is just a bunch of lies. They did not stop, they are the one who started it. They had to rid the world of pagans and witches becuase half of the world was that religion before the birth of christ. If you actually read a few books by actual witch's who tell their sotry you'll see that Witches don't even belive in the devil. This is just another book to spread christian dogma. I'd give it a 0 if I could."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"Whether you wish to attack Christianity or support it, you have to read this book. It provides detailed evidence leading to conclusions that will be surprise anyone raised and educated in the secular Western world."
5,I agree!,"I agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer. This book tells you how to sing, not just what should happen in good singing. I don't know of any other book that spends the time needed to address setting up the structure for singing and especially the tongue and high larynx which causes most of the problems that as a voice teacher I encounter! This is amazing.getting over the urge to gag is really worth it! I'd like to be in contact with other teachers and singers who find this really great. It has meant so much to many of my students who went to teachers who seemed to be afraid of this approach and who use only the ear and imagery to overcome real physical ignorance or misunderstandings. There is help out there for the tight, retracting, tense and lazy tongue. What freedom this offers!!!!!!"
1,Short life span,"It has a nice design. However it spins too slowly. I accidentally dropped it in the bathroom sink after the third use. It got wet and stopped working. I replaced the batteries, but it's still a no go. The unit apparently shorted out."
2,Disappointed,"The spinbrush was average - it didn't do anything extra special. The massager kind of hurt on my forehead and chin and was not soothing anywhere else. However, the biggest disappointment was the pore cleaner. The suction did not do anything at all. It did not remove blackheads like it was supposed to. Save your money and buy a $4 facial exfoliator at the drugstore!!!"
4,A journey of love...,"Luci Tapahonso's voice is one of the most beautiful in contemporary Native American literature. Her poetry usually revolves around family, community, interpersonal relationships -- those things which my dear uncle says are the only things that really matter in this life anyway. When reading this volume, you will get the feeling that you are sitting at the kitchen table with Luci, her family and your family, listening to old stories, new stories, gossip and adventures. SAANII DAHATAAL also contains one of her most popular poems, ""Raisin Eyes"" -- and ladies, be honest...we've all been in Ella's shoes!! Try this book, and you'll love it -- then try Ms. Tapahonso's other books, and you will be an admirer forever. Her newest, BLUE HORSES RUSH IN, is probably her best collection ever, although this one is certainly no sloucher! Read this book, and you'll never regret buying it"
3,Not Sure How Effective,"Nature Made Daily Diabetes Health PackI bought these for my husband a few years ago as he has Type II Diabetes and was always tired. I read the reviews regarding increased energy, etc. and hoped they would do the same for him. He took them for 14 months yet he reported no effects, good or bad, during the time he took them.Eventually, we just stopped ordering them and have noticed no difference at all without them. I don't expect vitamins to be miracle workers but I did hope to see ""some"" benefit from them. As he took them for 14 months we should have noticed some change, surely."
2,A little funky romanization.,"Sadly, I cannot give this book a nice review.Jane Wightwick et al produce some excellent Arabic instruction books, but this simple chinese vocab book seems to have fallen through the cracks.It does little to provide more than rote memerization of the characters, but really falls short on the romanization. Not only is pining not used or mentioned, the entire notion of Chinese being a tonal language isn't even mentioned! So you get words like ""ya-ds"" or ""ger-bou"" and thats all you get. Which is useless without tonal information.It may be worth the low price to use the flash cards alone, but that's about all."
3,Decent for very beginners,"I liked this book because it was inexpensive and had provided flashcards at the back of the book. It helps with building comfortableness with hanzi, and can be used to build very basic levels of pronunciation.The book, however, uses a unique romanization system (it's definitely not the Hanyu pinyin the PRC uses), and does not indicate what tone the words should be pronounced with. Its justification is that ""Chinese will understand by context,"" but without teaching any grammar, I don't see how context can be established.I'd say it's worth the $9, but you might also want to get a dictionary so you can learn the tones that go with it."
2,Bad:(,"Sadly, there is no Pinyin. The romanization that is used is confusing...Secondly, especially a beginner of Mandarin needs a Audio CD in order to know how to correctly pronounce a new word...Why is it called ""Chinese""? ""Mandarin"" or ""Putonghua"" would be more accurate..."
1,Wierd chemicals in this one!,"These have a gel filling that is a plastic solvent. My cyber gel squeeze ball got left in a box with an old cassette (remember those?) and it melted the plasic into a semi-sticky stretchy plastic. As I type, I have a plastic residue on my hands that won't wash off. Wierd chemicals."
5,A Great Read For Hip-hop Heads,"This is an extraordinary book for the Hip-hop lover. There are poems in this book that range in everything from racial profiling, sex, love, politics and so much more. Shabazz-Perez definetly executed the struggle in the black community and aided in the constant attempts of the African Americans to let their voices be heard through the muck of the streets.The concept of this book was hot. Mr. Shabazz-Perez understands that poetry(Hip-hop, Spoken Word) is an outlet for our youth and acts as the news paper for those who don't know whats going on in today's world. This book touches on so many live subjects and it puts perspective on hoodlife, streetlife, and just life as a whole.For those who are looking for a change of pace and loves to read the urban brand books, this is the book for you. Don't pass up an opportunity to read Acid Rains on My City, But I See Rainbows in the Puddles."
3,"Good Album, Not Best If Series Though","This collection of Pure Moods CDs started with this CD and was definitely good enough to justify the rest of the entries in the series. These CDs start by taking pop songs, remaking them into semi-new age songs and then collecting them with other new age songs. They're nice and relaxing and just edgy enough to keep mainstream folks interested. Out of the series I would have to say that this is my thrid favorite. If you're heard the others then you should be satisfied with this album, if you're new to the series I would recommend picking up Pure Moods II."
4,Almost Perfect!!,"Anyone who's actually reading an online review of a Pure Moods album has to be, in my most humble of opinions, an established fan of the franchise, and I'm no exception: I LOVE Pure Moods. I have all 5 installments and Christmas Moods.But on Pure Moods III, there is one song that simply does not belong: ""Silk Road"" by Kitaro. That has to be the most annoying, shrill, plodding sequence of sounds I've ever come across. I only listen to that track about 33% of the time. (I sporadically listen to it, just to see if I can hear it differently that time.) I would like to make a burn of this CD that does not contain that song.Everything else rocks my socks.Buy Pure Moods."
4,One of the best!,"Pure Moods volume 3 is probably the second best in the series after the original Pure Moods. With mainstays such as Yanni and Enigma how can you go wrong? Powerful tracks like ""Deliver Me"" from Sarah Brightman and Peter Gabriel's ""Games without Frontiers"" highlight this release. As with the rest of the Pure Moods series this is very good and worthy of repeat listenings. Other great CD's include Imogen Heap, any Digital Moodz CD and Enigma's 1st CD or LSD."
2,New-age mello-yello,"This is the kind of utter garbage they use to subdue wild boars in Papua New Guinea. An utterly wasteful collection of schlocky new-age pipey music, all under the guise of the ""PURE MOODS"" label."
5,Another great addition to the Pure Moods family!,"What can I say? The Pure Moods series has always had a knack for blending the best music pieces from around the world, and bringing them all together on one awesome disc.This album features an impressive array of world encompassing songs, such as Enya's ""Only if,"" as well as Native American music such as Sacred Spirit's ""Dela Dela."" Some songs like Kitaro's ""Silk Road"" even blend in a sound of the orient into this wonderous album.One of the best features of this album is that it gives you such a wide range of musical items to chose from, and if you like a certain artist or song, the booklet included gives you all of the information you need to find out what original album/movie the song came from!If you love New Age music, and if you love to listen to a broad variety of world music, you have to get this cd!"
5,Pure Moods is pure enjoyment,A friend gave me the original Pure Moods collection several years ago. I played it all the time!When II was released I hesitated to buy it because I felt it would have to be a disappointment after Vol. I. But it wasn't. II was another delightful surprise.Then III was released and I did not hesitate to buy it - and it did not disappoint. I see that IV has now been released and I can't wait to hear it!
2,"Pure Moods, Vol. III","I did not find that I enjoyed it as much as Pure Moods, Vol. IPure Moods Vol I, I think is still the best"
2,A big letdown,"Things just seem to have gone downhill since the first Pure Moods album. This new compilation has hardly any energy or appeal. Moby's Porcelain is a worthy inclusion, but some of the other tracks are just dull. Silk Road just seems to rechannel the theme from the Last Emperor, from the first Pure Moods. I think that instead of sticking to ""New Age"", this album should have ventured to include what you wouldn't normally think to include in a Pure Moods album. How about something from the soundtrack to Run Lola Run? The truth is that the people behind the Pure Moods albums have already mined the best of New Age music, and are not daring enough to stray from the formula. That's a shame"
3,An interesting view into the videos that started it all!,"This collection of videos showcase Depeche Mode at their worst. Some of the worst videos of their careers, which are so poorly done they provide non-stop hilarity. This is a must-have for die-hard fans, but anybody will enjoy mocking DM, as they make fools of themselves. This page doesn't give a track-listing, so hear one is. 1.Just Can't Get Enough, 2. Everything Counts, 3. Love, In Itself, 4. People Are People(12"" Version), 5. Master And Servant, 6. Somebody, 7. Blasphemous Rumours, 8. Shake the Disease, 9. It's Called a Heart, 10. Photographic(live), 11. A Question of Lust.Most of these are very bad, Shake the Disease is the coolest!"
4,80's clasic,"Depeche Mode has stood the test of time and is widely regarded as one of the greatest synth-oriented rock bands of all time, and rightly so. The true genius of the band, in my opinion, can be found in their live performances. The incredible intensity of a Depeche Mode live presentation is quite unforgettable, never more so than in the live version of ""Photographic"", and its inclusion in this video collection alone makes this a MUST have."
3,Not a very sturdy part....,"Wears out every five to six months. I'm surprised there hasn't been an upgrade, but then why should there be, Krups has the consumer in a corner.I agree with the other review...postage is ridiculous on this item considering it can be mailed in an envelope. The gasket is available directly from Krups, but the last time we looked postage was slightly higher there. It's a no-win situation.Since we're having to replace the gasket every five to six months, we've started to order two at a time to help offset postage."
4,AB-FAB HAREM REMIXES BUT ORIGINAL STILL TOPS!,"These ""Harem"" remixes are quite fun - the Hex Hector mix being the finest of the three - all thumping, throbbing house beats with Brightman's crystalline voice sailing above all the insanity. However, like most remixes, these are best experienced on the dance floor or at a bar at 3:00AM when making out with the guy next to you. As a listening experience, Sarah's original album version is still the finest and, at times, even superior in terms of dancing to. As for the ""It's A Beautiful Day"" remix by the Groove Brothers (?), I find nothing outstanding about it and for the luv of God, what did they do to Sarah's voice? It's been altered & speeded-up to sound like the Munchkinland scene in ""The Wizard of Oz"". Once again, the album version is superior in both vocal and dance elements. Still recommended as a fun, party disc and remember, the ""Harem"" remixes were #1 on the Billboard dance charts."
2,Oh my ears!,"This single is a missed opportunity! What you get is basically the album tracks with repetitive and dated house rhythms clumsily spread on top. Imagine if the Eastern instrumentation had been highlighted a la Transglobal Underground, or perhaps the ambiance explored in a similar way to the remixes William Orbit did for Madonna's ""Frozen"" single. Come on Sarah and Frank, give us a real remix, not just the same song with a cacophony of drum machines on top."
4,It's a beautiful.... Harem,"this is a great combination of middle east sounds mixed with the classical or angelical voice of Sarah. it has excellent mixes the best are the Hex hector mix, and the groove bros mix of the second single Beautiful Day. u Cant miss this!!!"
4,Good Secondary Tool,"Bought this item as an extra set of ceramic beads which I use frequently. Takes up less storage space that beads, comes away from the pan quickly, works well in conjuction with beads to ""fill"" the shell when blind baking."
5,The Ancient Harp of Scotland by William Jackson,"This is a beautiful album. The music is peaceful, ethereal, very enjoyable. This is an instrumental album, no lyrics. It's a great companion to Bonnie Rideout's A Scottish Christmas. I play this for my children at night as it's very peaceful but not too sweet like most lullaby music. It's wonderful ""background"" music, for a Christmas party, for any occasion to add ambiance. William Jackson is an accomplished musician. See his website."
3,Not complete,I have the book Painter IX for Photographers. I have not been able to get images from the disc into my IMac G5.I made some effort to call for help but couldn't get through or some reason I can't recall. I have been disgusted and very busy to get back into the book. I wasn't able to actually use the programs without the disc access. I am not a beginner in digital. Nelson PadenPS This is a call for assistance and basically not a review.
1,Poor Quality tutorial,"This book is very confusing and although I am a photographer and very knowledgeable in photoshop, I have been unable to learn Painter IX from this text. The CD is missing a complete portion of a tutorial and have contacted the author to no avail"
1,Not easy to follow,"I found this ""how to"" hard to folow, giving some instructions that were just unclear or didn't give all the steps. It was not easy to find answers to specific questions either. The photo examples were monotonous. I felt very frustrated trying to follow along."
5,Renders Painter IX comprehensible,"Painter has long confused me. I'm not an ""artist"", just a photography hobbyist interested in new ways of expression. Painter always seemed just too tough, too steep a learning curve for the casual user.This book makes Painter to easy to understand and use for the photographer. The book is useful to users of Photoshop, Photoshop Elements and Paint Shop Pro.Addision moves at a comfortable pace, exploring one tool after another. His projects and exercises are not demanding, but are very instructive. Many examples are provided on the accompanying CD-ROM.Overall, this is a great way for any photographer wanting to expand their capabilities to learn Painter. I wish there more books like this for other difficult to master programs. I recommend it highly.Jerry"
5,cooking for a restaurant,I bought this when I was working for a 5* Deli and bakery. I was in charge of making the salads and soups. It was so wonderfully easy to follow and different enough that I was able to make some very creative dishes that our customers were asking for the recipe. I highly recommend it.
4,Good advice for practical people,"The New Maximize Your Body Potential offers sound advice for anyone thinking of a weight loss, including journal assignments and other nontraditional approaches to long term goal setting. Reading this book will help you not only get motivated for a regular exercise program, it will also help you manage stress and think about your eating in whole new ways. The book might benefit from more personal examples or personal stories but as a weight management primer, you will get results as you begin to internalize its message. For those of you looking for an alternative to Oprah's Make the Connection, give this book a try."
5,Great book,"Very interesting book. Lots of good information that I hope I never have to use, but it's there if I need it."
5,Read it-- You'll Love it.,"The Return of the Hummingbird Wizard is just flat exceptional. Penned as a visionary fiction, it is poetic, touching and hilarious - all often on the very same page. Its ""Ten Songs of the Hummingbird"" are a mixture of profoundly new spiritual strains of thought and time-tested philosophical credos. And they all work. Apply them in your daily life and watch the changes come. It's also the most beautiful affirmation of the angelic in our lives all presented in the warm and familiar world of animals. Read it. You'll love it."
5,Amazon's Brown Newsboy Cap,The color of this cap is unique and will blend with most of my wardrobe. Fits great and holds its shape. A quality cap.
2,Wrong color,"The hat fits fine (but it's a good thing my head isn't any bigger or smaller or it may not), but as the other person stated, the color is nothing like the one pictured. It is an extremely dark brown (almost black). The hat definitely looks better in the pics."
1,Not Worth It Even @ $9.99!,"I was so looking forward to the arrival of this cap only to be be disappointed! The only good thing I can say about it is the fit - that was perfect. BUT - the color is actually a very dark brown - almost black. Also the construction is horrible! Some of the seams are not tight, showing an innerfacing underneath. I am sending this cap back!!"
1,better help elsewhere,"I tried for years to control IBS with diet, exercise, medications, etc. I never got anywhere with that. I recently tried an 'assist' from the 'Assist Processing Handbook' from L Ron Hubbard, and I was feeling much better within a couple of hours. If you have already ruled out food allergies (and any structural problems), and can't seem to control IBS with books such as this one, please do yourself a favor and get the assist book."
4,Great recent photos of The Intimidator,"This is a great photo book of the late Dale Earnhardt. I am a Dale fan so I am a bit biased. This book has many great and colorful photos of Dale, Dale and Teresa, Dale with the crew in the car and several winners circles. The only drawback to this book was that there are no photos of Dale in his early days or none of him growning up. But I loved the photos of Dale without his famous moustache (Dale shaved it when he and Teresa went to the Bahamas one year and went snorkeling)and there are 2 photo collages of all Dale that make a larger photo of Dale when looked at from a distance. Very different and clever!!! But if you are a Dale fan then this is a must have. If you love NASCAR and want to know more about Dale then you may want to check out other books first but I do recommend it as it is well worth the money!!!!"
4,Stunning vision of the next century of research,"The case of down syndrome is one that is complex yet simple, and challenging yet easy. To understand the complexities that must occur to result in an affected patient is beyond most human comprehension. This book does a great job at highlighting the past milestones in research, yet focusing primarily on the future of study in this subject. Bill optomistically creates a nurturing sense of hope in all patients currently affected by this raveging disease, and instills hope for a better life, living life to the fullest"
3,Not the MENU sold at Petsmart,"This VitaKraft MENU guinea pig food is not the same as the MENU brand sold at Petsmart. It has a significant portion of what looks like oats in it, which our guineas won't eat. For future reference, you can tell the two kinds apart by the front label: the one with oats has a small yellow banner below the word MENU that says VITALITY, but the one sold at Petsmart one does not."
1,I choose this particluar book based on the positive reviews,"I was very disappointed when I received this dictionary today. The print is so small that I cannot read it. I tried using a small magnifing glass but to no avial. I am 45 years old and attend college, my vision is 20-20 with my glasses and I can still read the phone book. But this type is just too small. Any suggestions on a different dictionary with average print."
4,Successful Communication in short time,I had never been to Honduras before and had very limited Spanish. There were times when those who knew Spanish would ask to borrow my dictionary because they were having trouble finding the right word. The list of usages for words and phrases was very helpful. The size was perfect for my pants pocket. I was able to leave it with a new found friend to help him with his English. I will be getting another copy for my trip next year.
5,I need to know if this publisher has an unabridged version,"I cannot believe that such a small dictionary has so much information, the english part which is what I use the most has so many ways to focus one word: technical, business, social, etc. you name it,this little book has it....Please if anybody knows about an unabridged version from this publishers I would love to get it."
5,Concise and precise,"Concise and precise- just what the busy clinician wants to see. And for whoever needs more info, there is an extra CD Rom that preovides just that. Few medical books had more impact on my professional behavior than this one. Buy it, read it, and follow its advise!"
4,great bookclub book,"After a slow, simple start, this book really draws the reader in! Try not to be confused by all the characters in the beginning, there are really just 4 and they become very well developed. The story almost reminded me of Forest Gump, with the main character's (Gummie) nostalgic memories of her life. It was a great book that made me laugh, cry and really wish it could keep going. We read it for bookclub, and we all enjoyed it. It leaves the reader with a warm feeling, one of those books you want to share with a friend, and then talk about. There's alot for bookclub discussion, don't limit yourself to the reader's guide at the end of the book. Enjoy!"
4,The lady from Mocedades.,"She was the lead on the group Mocedades during her solo years. Unfortunately i didn't know some of the songs, however her voice was fantastic. Worth buying just to hear her sing even if it's a phone book!!!"
2,"Truly few, micro stars","As a long time AH fan, I picked up this album with incredible anticipation. I was totally and thoroughly disapointed. Not to say that this not a good CD, just not what I expected. Nothing like ""Complex Instructions..."" or ""Superincredible..."" Their new sound appeals more to some than others. It just didn't seem to agree with me like a bad burrito or something. Yet, there still are a few good songs here and it wouldn't be a waste of money picking this up."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Definitely not as good as I thought it would be. You may as well go a bit further and read Sin City.Chaykin's style is certainly suited to the material, with sex, violence noir, dames, tough guys and all that sort of thing. With strippers, of course, but this did not quite hit the mark for me."
2,Howard Chaykin's answer to Sin CIty,Howard Chaykin does some nice stylized comic book illustrations. But also kinda conservative in composition and layout.Black Kiss is a sloppy Noir mess. The plot is not quite there. THe story doesnt add up. The action and sex arent up to par (in the story or on the page). The scenes arent well developed and are under utilized. THeres not much to get excited about.so I cant recommend this book.
2,I really expected more,I ordered this based on Amazon's recommendation before I noticed the publisher was Eros. Seeing how Amazon recommended I assumed that it would be a pretty good film noir in comics and it wasn't.
5,OUR FAVORITE WEE SING VIDEO!,My one year old boy loves this video. The music is upbeat and characters are as real to the imagination as they can be! We highly recommend Under the Sea!
3,"Definately not the best Wee Sing Made, But kids still like.","This video had the potential to be really magical and fun, But I think the producers spent too much money on the stationery set and felt they had to spend a lot of time on each scene. It becomes monotonous to sit through some of the songs looking at creatures that can barely move their mouths. The voices are also a little annoying. There is an otter who sounds like a whiny little kid and an Octopus who sings in an exaggerated slightly operatic voice that cuts into your brain and makes you want to shut off the video. Of course by this time-your kids are hooked!"
3,Missing the best line,"The best line in this movie, where the Zoe character says ""We are thinking about having her spayed"". This was when the boys and girls were playing tennis has been edited out of this copy of the movie. Would have been four stars otherwise. Mindless, teen flick from out of my past, is still fun and watching Patricia Arquette in this one you could tell that she was destined to be in better movies. If it ever comes out on DVD properly edited I will grab it."
5,GREAT WORK LIGHT! 11 hours on high beam! Still had some life left!,"I'm a post production engineer and this make a great work light! We often are working in tight not very well lit areas, doing troubleshooting, installing equipment and wiring. Being able to have a bright light wherever you look has been a tremendous boost to my productivity. You are never working in a shadow.I used these the first day I got them and ran the batteries 11 hours straight on the high setting and they were only a little dim. I don't know how much I could have got out of them as I switched them out for new batteries. The batteries are a little pricey but for me the productivity increase offsets the price. Highly recommend."
2,Nice Light but has Switch Problem,"I used the light for several months and then the switch went bad. Took it to the recommended dealer who confirmed the switch was bad (cleaned it and it worked but ordered a new one for warranty replacement). The entire light was replaced at no cost. After a few weeks, the switch on the replacement light did not work once but seems to be doing okay now. This light definitely has a switch deterioration problem as evidenced by several other commenters. It's a great light if they could put a better switch on it."
2,Keep extra batteries nearby.,I've had this for a few years and yes - it does throw out a lot of light - but even at lower settings the batteries drain quickly (less than an hour of use). I suspect it drains power from them while the unit is switched off but have no proof of it.
5,STEAMLIGHT HANDS FREE,I BOUGHT FOR WORK WHEN I AM IN THE CEILING WIREING UP SPEAKERS WORKS GREAT 1 WATT WILL LAST LONG TIME 2 1/2 HOURS I GET THE BATTERYS HALF PRICE ON EBAY.
5,Light the way,"Bought this for running. Works great. Second day after I got it, there was a problem under our house. Used it to crawl around in the dark. Worked perfectly. Now we can think of many uses besides running."
5,Outstanding Light.......,"Very bright light for it's size, and let's you keep your hands free to work. I use it at night to haul in firewood,and it is great to do jobs such as plumbing, electrical, where you need more light on the situation. Turn it on high setting and you can ride a bike or push snow with it. Don't know how I made it without it. Can't comment about the durability b/c I have only had it about a month, but I suspect it will last for years like other streamlight products."
5,Dynamic Duo!,"This is a fantasitc recording! Jemeel Moondoc and Denis Charles work wonderfully together. I am especially a fan of Mr. Charles' drumming, and his work here furthers my admiration. This is some of the most listenable freebop to be found. My 2 year-old daughter loves to dance to it!"
3,"Ok, but has some flaws","I bought this tonneau cover as an intermediate solution while waiting for a Leer Topper to come in. It works ok, but the tensioning system where you roll down the back frame rail has broken twice. It had a very very small and cheap plastic clip that releases and holds the frame rail in place. The manufacturer sent me two pieces free of charge, but I was unable to operate the tonneau until the pieces were replaced. Would only recommend in a pinch. If I have to buy another one again it will have the old snaps also, I didn't care for how difficult it was to seal the cover overall, and the seal is very rigid so when you roll it up it takes up more space than the traditional snap styles."
4,"Great book, but leaves a few essentials out","Lewis Carbone knows his stuff, and it shows in his offering, Clued In. We are going through the process at our company and, although we see the potential and understand what Carbone means by the ""customer experience,"" it still requires a psychologist on staff to help us understand how to go about ""mining for clues."" In a nutshell, great book, gets everyone on board in seeing the potential for increased bottom line. But mining for clues is an essential part of the process, and Mr. Carbone leaves the reader with a feeling that the process is somehow mystical."
4,Great guide book for experience management,"Building on The Experience Economy, Carbone's book adds significant details and road maps to achieve experience management. Highly readable."
2,cheapest plastic i've seen in years,"reminds me of the cheap plastic japanese toys from the 1960s - and i mean real brittle, also feels like it'll break if you drop it. Spilled some MEK (methyl ethyl ketone - similiar to acetone) on one and it nearly melted like a candle. Really kind of disappointed - not the seller's fault but definitely Ryobi's"
3,Valuable information and insights,"Aimed at non-specialists, ""Before European Hegemony"" paints a picture of the Old-World-spanning commerce system of the 13th and 14th centuries.It's informative, readable, controversial and somewhat one-sided. No one can purport to have serious opinions on this period of economic history without taking her views into consideration.A personal gripe. The text is sprinkled with semi-random quotation marks, seemingly to imply doubt as to the appropriateness of the word or phrase chosen, but without necessarily suggesting a better one. It's difficult to find a single page devoid of this mannerism."
5,Great brush,I love it because it's huge and holds a lot of water without dripping. Prices are all over the map so shop carefully.
2,BAD product for the professional,"I run a small construction company in the Chicago area. My DeWalt 18V hammer/driver passed away(6yrs old) and I needed a new drill pronto. I purchased this drill from a local box store about 3 years ago. I use the drill daily on the job. Since I purchased the drill it has been in for service 3 times!!! All 3 times the transmission and the clutch were replaced. B4 Christmas, once again, the transmission burned up. The battery charger sounds like a 747 taking off; I later learned the noise is present due to the charger being defective. The molded case is one of the worst I've seen in 16 yrs in the construction industry. My case is literally held together with duct tape. This tool will probably suffice for the weekend warrior but for a professional it sucks (unless you like to wait 3 weeks out of every year to have it serviced)!! I picked up the new Panasonic 21.6V and must say it is far SUPERIOR to the makita."
1,Repugs Don't Like Facts. That's Why They Fail!,This woman needs some serious help and her children need to be invested for child abuse. The rate of Republican child molesters is staggering. They seriously have personality problems. Thank you for making a published document for us to use in the history books when people look back at the darkest moment in American history.
3,It's okay,"It's an okay book, kind of funny at times. It is true that Hollywood tries to tell kids how to act and dress, though good parenting would dictate not allowing young, impressionable minds to not be overexposed to those situations in the first place. An 8 year old with a Britney or Madonna CD? Not in my house!Had I been aware that the author of the book is on the site participating in nonsense arguments, I would not have read the book. She writes a book about celebrites being on people's cases about how to act, etc. and here she (""celebrity"") is bashing others. No wonder she knew how to write the book. Just be an author and not some forum fighter."
1,Best Kids Book EVAR!!! (j/k),"My kids love reading the ""Help! Mom!"" series. Both Cindy and Pete are homeschooled, and I've found that this book is helpful in teaching political science with a humorous twist! Unemployment has never been funnier than in this book!Despite the knee-slapping good times, I do have a problem with Hillary Clinton appearing in a pants-suit. In a book marketed toward children, no less! I don't need my 9-year old Cindy seeing gender-confused garbage in her home.Other than that small bump, this book is great. I'd recommend it to any parent who is sick of the liberal media telling them how to raise their kids! Rush Limbaugh and Katharine DeBrecht, however, have a strong vision of the TRUE AMERICAN FAMILY and have great plans for our toddlers."
1,Must Be Part of the 34%! They Nominated A Coke-Head Convict and His Murderer Wife Laura,Love those family values. Shows how screwed up the right wing is. Thank god the country has turned against them. Keep screwing up morons! You're making it so much easier for us. Get ready to cry in 08!
5,Right on point when it comes to liberals,I bet the women on the view hate this book. If there is anything praiseworthy or of good report a liberal will try and corrupt it.
2,Illustrations are rather fun but the story dissapointed me.,"I appreciate what the author is trying to accomplish, and I can't say I know how I would relate the evils of Hollywood's values, or lack thereof, to children between four and eight years old.That said, I found the story disappointing because it consumed page after page but didn't really go anywhere. One parody of a celebrity after another appears in a child's bedroom closet and talks children into buying ridiculous clothing items for large amounts of money. The children find out at the end that they have a lot of ridiculous clothing, no money, no more babysitting job, and thus they can't buy what they really wanted to buy in the first place.It's a narrow, repetitive story with an anticlimactic ending. I guess I just expected more since I own the first book in this ""Help, Mom.."" series and it seemed to deal with liberals in a much broader, though stereotypical, way than this book dealt with Hollywood."
5,The irony!!!,"First off Im a liberal, lets get that out of the way.Second off I got this book not for my conservative relatives or anything like that, this was a straight up gag gift. The fact that anyone would seriously read this to a child is screwed up in the head.As a gag gift its great. It makes a good head turner whenever people see it, not to mention a good conversation starter.The people who wrote this along with those that take this seriously are just as bad as creationists (well, their probably one in the same)."
4,An entertaining follow-up . . .,". . . to the first ""Help! Mom!"" book, taking on the subject of the Hollywood Elite, and their influence on what passes for ""pop culture"" today.The heroines of this book learn (the hard way) that following the latest trends to come out of Hollywood is not only futile -- but silly -- and that many of the so-called ""Hollywood Elites"" do take precisely the attitudes which are parodied in this book.Not quite as funny as the first book (a not uncommon problem with sequels) but nevertheless well worth the purchase price.As an aside, the tone of many of the reviews for both this book and its predecessor (to say nothing of the tenor of the comments) makes me want to suggest a follow-up title, to wit: ""Help! Mom! The Secular Progressives Have No Sense Of Humor!""Highly recommended!"
1,You've Got To Be Carefully Taught,"You've got to be taughtTo hate and fear,You've got to be taughtFrom year to year,It's got to be drummedIn your dear little earYou've got to be carefully taught.You've got to be taught to be afraidOf people whose eyes are oddly made,And people whose skin is a diff'rent shade,You've got to be carefully taught.You've got to be taught before it's too late,Before you are six or seven or eight,To hate all the people your relatives hate,You've got to be carefully taught- Oscar Hammerstein (damn librul)"
5,A Must Have CD...........,"I had been looking for this CD for a couple of years now and was excited when I saw it on Amazon.God is using Pastor Sheryl Brady in a mighty way. The CD is awesome and more than I expected. My favorites are I'll Be Loving You, Waiting on You, Hover On Me and Four Words.I love this CD!! Get it and you won't regret it!!!!"
5,Great Easter book for young children,"The art is gorgeous and the ABC's are an added bonus, but the very simple and yet direct story of Jesus, and the real reason we celebrate Easter, is wonderful! This is the only book I've found that addresses the real reason for Easter without being too complicated for young children."
2,Disappointed,"While the pictures in this book are very good, the ""alphabet"" examples are not. Also the so-called ""activities"" are just dumb."
2,Mystical Theology,"This is an extremely difficult book to read. It was required reading in my doctoral program, and I had great trouble getting through it. I found myself simply highlighting the parts I understood, rather than the central thoughts of the book. About the only thing I took with me from this book is explained on the back cover: we need to emphasize both the mystical nature of Christianity and sound theology, rather than favoring one over the other. It just seems that the author uses way too many words to get that concept across to the reader."
4,held up to 1 month of tent camping!,"After reading a lot of reviews, I took a chance on this AeroBed. I like it firm so had to top it off every night as it loses air throughout the day. I was super careful with it since some reviews complained of tearing...it lasted the whole month of tent camping through NM, AZ, UT and CO. I would have never lasted that long on a thin camping mat! Just be gentle with set up and folding procedures and you should be fine."
1,Extremely poor quality,"The one and only time this bed would stay inflated it was very comfortable. Folding the bed after deflating (the first time we used it) cracked the pvc in several places along one side. Maybe we got a dud, but still."
3,Not bad! will it last,"This sleeping bad did pretty good at Burning Man this year. It had to be refilled a little everyday put never went flat. I give a 3 star rating becauses Burning Man is extreme and I have not used it under less severe circumstances. My partner and I slept well and felt comfortable that our bed would hold up, which it did."
2,Looks Great! Rides Like a Boat!,"The Inlaws are comming soon and we had nowhere for them to sleep. This looked perfect. Well made and high off the floor. WE were pleased that it arrived so quickly. About four days. But, when we got on it to test it out, we found that the double matress design caused the occupents to sway back and forth, every whitchway, with every little movement. It felt like being in a boat, tied to the dock. in slightly choppy waters. This was the ONLY bad thing about it. I'm sorry, but I can not recomend this bed. They need to find some other way to make it higher off the floor. I decided to go with the standard design."
4,Good inflatible,"My previous aerobed was a raised - queen-sized aerobed with air chanbers external to the queen-sized footprint added for stability. Though it was the same height as a regular bed, it took up too much room, and was still very wobbly.We got this one as a replacement for the Raised-queen. Ours came with a hole, so we got to test the patch kit before it was even used. Thought to send it back, but we were in a jam with at least 400 pounds of inlaws arriving that night.Inflated bed using pump on Car Accessory power since it did not have a full charge. Placed air mattress on queen sized box spring (from my bed - cause you can't have your aged inlaws sleep on the floor).To my pleasant surprise, it was still inflated, and the in-laws reported comfortable sleep the next day."
1,"Sport Aero bed, raised twin","Terrible quality. The aero mattress itself is fine, but the electric pump didn't work upon arrival. Should yours work, remember, it has to charge for 24 hours before use."
2,Title is misleading,"While the book is supposed to be about redheaded woodpeckers, much of the information is really just about woodpeckers in general. Moreover, most of the pictures in this book are not of the redheaded woodpecker, most being of the gila woodpecker, and a few pileated woodpeckers as well. Also, each page of text has a small drawing of a woodpecker at the top. Is it a redheaded woodpecker? Nope. For some reason it's an ivory-billed woodpecker. As this book is meant for young children, I could imagine that all of this would cause some amount of confusion. Added to this is the fact that the information is very basic. So overall, I can't see why such a high price is justified for this book."
3,Did not endure as well as other comedies of its time,"To begin with, the DVD transfer is very good, but there are no subtitles, not even French ones. Audio is original French, of course.The movie itself is lightweight, this is children comedy at best. It is surprising to see that this was directed by the same Gerard Oury that made the classic La Grande Vadrouille. It is not the fault of the actors or of the director, but the fault of a weak script. It has its funny moments but there are few and far between. I was not impressed with the cutting either.I cannot recommend the movie, but if you want it and don't mind the lack of subtitles, this transfer is ok."
3,Very Disappointing,"I'll cut to the chase:1. Terrible graphics! My 4-year old asked me, ""Mommy, what's wrong with their faces?""2. Gender-bias in that the voices sounded like those from a cheap anime video. How many guy-oriented video games have the actual athletes' voices? I'd pay and extra $10 for a game with the original voices.3. It's easy to get lost if you don't have the best sense of direction....what 4-year old does? The ""progress"" chart was pointless. How about a map or something? My old Super Mario games had maps...and that was Nintendo!4. Incredibly irritating Parrot and Brutus, the monkey. I found myself trying to outrace Brutus for the gems all the while missing out on the mission and visual surroundings. Did ""options"" offer turning off the parrot's voice? I didn't check. If not, that would have been VERY NICE!5. Overall, the plot was too simple and did not hold my children's attention very well. This video game is an insult to the consumer's intelligence."
5,Great game for little girls,"Obviously, I am rating this game based on my daughter's enthusiasm of the game. She is 7 1/2 years old and loves it. Great game for little girls."
2,Barbie - this is why girls don't play videogames,"Ever wondered why little girls don't play videogames?Take a look at Barbie (or Bratz for that matter) and you know why. Low production value and un-imaginative Game-play. Too bad, this one could have been fun."
1,A WASTE,"The cleaance price ""told"" me these would be ""dated"". However, I did NOT expect to get totally scentless GARBAGE."
2,Advertised wrong,This helmet was advertised and sold as auto-darkening. I bought one each for my husband and my son. They said that the lens wasn't auto-darkening.
2,problems,"It was a wonderful idea, but I was disappointed by the book. In my view the illustrations are stylized, sterile, and off-putting - you can see if you agree with me by enlarging the cover and taking a look at it - , the graphic design and color patterns produced visual clutter, and the poems are in not-easy-to-read stylized italics. But what prompted me to comment was the alteration of language of at least one, and I suspect more than one, of the poems. The eight-line poem I checked begins: ""I'm nobody. Who are you?"" In Ms. Winter's book line four of this poem substitutes ""advertise"" for ""banish us,"" line six substitutes ""frog"" for ""fog,"" and line seven substitutes ""June"" for ""day."" As you can see for yourself, these changes degrade the poem. I suppose this is considered legitimate bowdlerization, given the audience. I don't agree. In any event the author and editors were remiss in failing to include a notice that at least one of the poems was altered."
3,Dynomax Super Turbo 17749,The muffler is exactly what I wanted in regards to the sound. It is just a little bit louder than stock. The muffler has been installed on my GMC Canyon for a almost three weeks now. I have not seen any increase in MPG though which is the reason I purchased it.
1,Ott floor lamp 2 in 1,I want people to know my experience with the Ott 24 watt 2 in 1 floor lamp. I bought one at JoAnn fabrics. After two weeks the bulb stopped working. I went online and found that others had the same kind of problems. I took the lamp back but the store would not give a refund because I had thrown away the box. Be warned.
2,A so-so comedy-thriller from England.,"For those who enjoy their ghostly chills mixed with comedy, this movie is a disappointment. The classic comedy ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" does a much better job of providing laughs among the ghouls. On the plus side, the authentic British locations help set the gloomy atmosphere. The three ""college kids"" who decide to spend the night in the haunted castle are tiresome. We can make an exception for Ingrid, the delighfully blonde exchange student who tours the castle in spiked heels. The ghosts are dull rather than menacing; just a bunch of English actors dressed in Renaissance costumes. There are no gauzy special effects, worth mentioning. There are some mild chuckles along the way, but not enough to matter. This movie may have some appeal for the ""so-bad-it's-good"" crowd, but others should beware. Even the East Side Kids did better than this when they kept bumping into Bela Lugosi."
3,Saint Etienne redux,"Tiger Baby is derivative but that's not necessarily a bad thing when you model yourself after a group like Saint Etienne (SE). SE took 60's British Blue-eyed soul and melded it with synth dance beats in a tasteful way. Tiger Baby focuses a bit less on a distinctive time period but sounds quite similar in its arrangements and use of female vocals and synth beats with added sound effects here and there.If you haven't yet heard Saint Etienne buy their release called Fox Base Alpha first. If you've run through the SE body of works and hunger for more, Tiger Baby offers music in the same vein without sounding like a bad copy. ""Sweetheart"" and ""lost in you"" sound as though they could have been written by SE while sounding fresh."
5,George and Martha really Are two good friends!,What can one say about George. Sensative and impish. Martha is just too cool for words. She can give heavy guilt without saying a word.
1,Terrible for young kids,"I bought this book after it was suggested by a book store employee for my 2 and 3 year old children. When I read it I was really, really disappointed. I must be the only conservative mother still out there, but I didn't like reading a story that suggests ""smoking a cigar"" as a way to encourage someone to stop eating sweets. What?? are you serious?? Couldn't they use an example of eating worms?? Anything but smoking!! I wasn't fond of the other four stories in the book either. I know my children are young. But I wouldn't even approve of reading this to a 13 year old.I think there are many, many other books out there that are better for children"
1,utter deception by 2 real life ministers,"2 ordained ministers preach at you after you, the sinner, were foolish enough to think that the hot woman in the bikini was indicative of the contents.In other words, preachers are lying to you to get you to watch their preach a thon.There is absolutely nothing inside that resembles the cover.Utter dreck."
1,Surprisingly Dry Considering the Subject Matter,"This fundamentally flawed ""documentary,"" which fails to even acknowledge the important distinction between use and abuse, had the potential of at least being the goofy video its cover promises, but instead only delivers a one-sided preachy self-promotion."
3,Not what you think,This is a documentary about two pastors who use a unique way to get the word out that porn is bad. It is interesting though.
1,JUNK,A negative 100 would be too high a rating for this nonsense. Religious zealotry hiding behind imagery and verbiage. It's disgusting that christian sociopaths would put forth something like this.
3,Not Impressed - except for zoom,"Before this camera I had an Olympus C-3020, and i have to say that camera took sharper pics than this one does. I send photos to a stock photography website and they have not accepted any pictures I have taken with this camera due to the sharpness just not being there. The zoom is awesome though, so I am planning on keeping the camera for concert pics."
4,Very good step up camera,This is my third Olympus Digital Camera. I became a fan in 2000 when I bought my C-3000. I still use that one quite a bit. My second Olympus was the D-590 - I bought it because I wanted a compact camera to throw in my purse. For the money the SP-500 can't be beat. I got mine for $139. I haven't had any problems with blurry images or indoor lighting. My only issue is the battery compartment cover - it is hard to close and I'm concerned it may snap off. The lack of image stabilization hasn't been an issue. When you hold the shutter button half way down the camera locks the focus - I've never had an out of focus picture at any zoom level using this method. I'm very pleased with this camera's performance.
2,Couldn't get a clear picture in AUTO mode!,"I purchased this camera after much researching but to my dismay, I couldn't seem to get a clear picture in Auto mode, let alone in Sports mode without blur!?My previous camera was a Sony 3.2 MP and I could take clear pics in auto mode and I could get non-blurry action shots of my kids.... this was very puzzling to me.....I returned the camera immediately and opted for the CANON SD600 which is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! Clear pics and Clear action shots in AUTO mode!"
1,What a waste of money and memories.,My girlfriend (now wife) gave me this camera before I left on an 8 month trip to SE Asia. I was excited... until I started trying to record my memories with it. The focus feature on this camera is so bad that almost every one of my pictures came out blurry or the focus took so long that the shot was missed. I ended up having her bring my heavy old Canon S30 with her to Thailand so I could have some decent pics. Spent a long time with Olympus who were absolutely no help to me. I still try this camera out now and again and am still disappointed each time. I absolutely hate this camera and am sorry that my wife wasted her money on it!
3,My first 10X optical zoom camera,"This camera is the second digital camera I have purchased. My previous camera was a Canon Powershot 70 with 3Xoptical zoom. I purchased the Olympus because I wanted a higher megapixel and a higher optical zoom and a camera with a viewfinder. This camera met all qualifications even though it is considerably larger than the Canon. However, it is very difficult to hold the camera steady enough to get a clear picture at full zoom, so I find myself using it at about 3X or 4X. The biggest drawback of this camera compared to my Canon is the computer software. It is not nearly as user friendly or as flexible as the Canon software. I will continue to use this camera but plan to buy another Canon because of its convenience of size and software."
3,too many blurry pictures,"i owned this camera for 2 weeks. i took about 200 pics with it. while many of them came out fine-great color and sharpness, too many were blurry, especially some i really wanted to keep. the moment was lost. whether it was hand-shaking or the lack of IS, i don't know. i expected more clarity."
5,Mostly great camera,"This camera is great!The large screen, though compact size, really handy functionalities that I still keep discovering, and of cource, great quality of the images make this camera wonderful and loveable. User can choose between image quality settings to compromise between quality and memory occupation while the highest setting - SHQ (super high quality) - really makes superb images. Try that with macro zoom and discover exciting unseen dimensions!Things that are not that great are:Since the focus is fully automatic, it takes at least few seconds for camera to get ready for shot. Therefore one cannot snap pictures to catch any desireable moment. There is a program to take sequence of pictures while only first take must be focused. That helps a bit.Another thing is that dark images seem bit fuzzy. The darknes itself is never black-dark, but covered with dark-coloured mist.All that with the price make the camera wonderful for most of users in most of situations."
4,Outstanding Camera,I've had my SP-500 since just before Christmas and it has performed extremely well. I just had a 12 x18 and 16 x20 enlargement done and the quality was very good. Costco recommended against the 16 x 20 but I found the picture to be excellent with no noticeable grain unless you get extremely close.Image stabilization would be a nice addition but by being careful and/or using a monopod I have gotten excellent pictures even at full zoom.I would recommend this camera highly for immediate photographers.
3,Soft Focus but Feels Good,"I really wanted to like this camera, but I finally decided to send it back and get a different one. Main reason: soft focus. It's very important to me to get extremely clear photos, and I was used to the clarity of the Olympus C740 UZ. This camera never gave me as clear a picture. I ended up with a Canon S2 IS, which is reasonably sharp, and takes excellent movies with sound as well. I also recommend the Olympus C765 as a sharp photo camera. The best thing about the SP500 UZ is the way it feels in your hand. But that wasn't enough. I do miss that part though. Get this camera if you like soft focus."
3,new digital camera user,I have now used my camera for about 2 months and I am still trying to figure out the various settings. It is much more difficult than the other reviews eluded to. The big disappointment is that I did not receive an Operation manual. Only a basic one with 20 or so pages (english) that wasn't helpful for first time digital camera users. My brother in the Netherlands who bought the same camera did receive the complete Operation manual. I eventually had to download over 189 pages. So when I study the manual and can take better pictures I will be happier. At this time I am disappointed with the results. Also Olympus customer service is not helpful. They just don't return your calls and ignore you. Not very good PR. New digital camera users should insist in a complete manual.
5,Motion sickness,I have (or should I say use to have) motion sickness. I have been using ginger root for about four years now. I take it daily for motion sickness. Prior to taking this supplement I would get sick on a boat (even in calm waters) and I could not even think about reading ANYTHING in the car. I also always had to ride in the front of the car. Since taking this product (and I mean since day one) my motion sickness does not exist. I was in rough seas and others were getting sick around me and I was fine. I have NO problems reading in the car and am now even able to ride a shuttle and/or bus.
3,I still don't know,"I started taking these capsules as an recommendation from the book ""Remedies for Acne: How to Diagnose and Dramatically Cure the Root Cause of Acne Forever."" I still don't know if it will help me with my acne, I will let you know. It's been only two weeks."
3,Ginger,On my last cruise I was taking a lot of these pills a day. On this cruise I found that taking 2 at a time gave me a sore throat. I took less and got very seasick! I needed to resort to Rx. meds.
3,Trying something different.,About 8 months back I developed fairly terrible indigestion - probably just a symptom of age but I was looking for ANYTHING to help alleviate my symptoms.I'd used gingers pills in the past for nausea and they seemed to do the trick and I figured for the low cost of these I might as well give them a shot so I went ahead and put my order in.These pills aren't small but I've never struggled with swallowing them - as for their effectiveness? Meh - I'm still out on that one but they seem to control a bit of my digestion issues.The only issue I've had with these so far is drinking a hot beverage while I take these - I've had them open in my throat (ow! they do burn a little bit if this happens) and also have experienced ginger flavor burps which is decidedly... odd.I'd say try them out if you do suffer from indigestion - if they end up working for you it's a very small price to pay.
5,Very happy with this product,I use this to calm tummies and also occasionally for tea (when I'm out of fresh ginger and also Trader Joe's candied ginger). It's a great product and works well for my purposes.
4,What can I say,I'm taking it because it is an anti inflammatory or so I have read. Not sure if I should be only taking fresh or not. Several medical conditions benefit from anti inflammatory medications but most over the counter products have seriously negative side effects.
5,Great,Love this stuff. great service. blah blah blah balh Alan Alan Alan Alan Alan Alan Alan Al Alan Ala Alan
2,Not so much,"I bought these because I heard that they might help relieve osteoarthritis pain, but they didn't work for me. I guess they have other health related benefits, but they didn't do anything for my pain."
1,gave me heartburn,I had to stop using because it gave me heartburn. I won't purchase again. Not worth it to me. Disappointing because of what I've read up on it.
1,Horrible,"I am about 6 weeks pregnant and am going through the horrors of ""morning sickness"", which is really morning, noon and night sickness! I read on a website to try these because it would supposedly help me with the nausea and upset stomach. It did the exact opposite. I took the 2 capsules the directions tell you to take, and I threw them up very soon after. It burned my throat on the way out. Never again will I take these, and if i can, I will be returning them!"
3,Great pill for horses,"These are cheap and seem to work as well as any other ginger product I have used (which is not much) but the pills are hard to swallow for me. I never have problems swallowing any pills but these are different. It's not the size of the pill its the coating. As soon as these get wet in your mouth the gel capsule becomes very tacky and can easily get stuck in your throat. I have learned that as long as I take three of four big gulps of water as soon as I take them it doesn't happen. But if I just treat these like a regular pill and take with a small sip of water, they get stuck nearly every time. I'm not saying they will choke you but you will know they're stuck when you burp ginger until the pills finishes dissolving. It's more irritating than anything but easily preventable using lots of water."
4,Great for inflammation,This is great for reducing inflammation which causes pain. I likeit because it is natural and you do not need pain killers.
4,Good Product,"I got hot after taking the product after dinner and just before bedtime when I was feeling some discomfort. Now, I take the product just before a meal and it seems to reduce the amount of discomfort."
5,My doctor recommended them,As part of an alternative pain management program my doctor recommended these capsules. My daughter uses them to help with her migraines and they have been less severe.
4,A natural flu vaccine?,"I've always been a bit of a believer in Ginger's healing powers.I was living in China for three years, and whenever I got sick some friends of mine would cook up their hometown remedy. Cola boiled with Ginger and Sichuan Peppercorn! Wooo, soar throat? runny nose? Cough? Instantly gone with this remedy! If it was a serious cold the symptoms would slowly come back the next day, but you just had to boil another one up for instant relief yet again.Twice a year I would visit a remote village area of China... It wasn't far enough north where they use indoor heating, so instead everyone would just wear extra clothes indoors. Without fail, I would get sick on every visit.I started taking these Ginger pills (2 a day with lunch) and the couple times I've since been back were incident free. Placebo effect? Perhaps, but it's more than welcome! I'll be continuing to take these."
4,Helps catch more fish,The Mag 5 does everything I need in a downrigger. This is my first electric downrigger and it does takes some practice getting the hang of raising and lowering the cable a few feet at a time. Very happy with this product.
2,Cannon Mag 5 HS Downrigger,"I had a previous model of this downrigger for many years before loosing it off of it's mounting while trailering my boat. The new 5 HS takes a bit of getting used to. First, it is really fast, maybe too fast. It is also noisy. The up and down switch is a problem if you want to raise the weight a few feet when trolling. Any up motion on the switch brings the weight all the way up until it clears the water. If you are trying to just raise the ball a little, it is easier to release the clutch and raise it up by manually turning the spool. It would be much easier if it were a 3 position switch like the older one. up is up, down is down, and the way-up position, brings the ball all the way up."
4,Getting to the fish.,"My new Cannon ""5-HS"" downrigger is just the ticket to get the lures down to where the fish are. Prior to using this device read ALL the documents and ask other fishermen about using a downrigger properly. Practice raising and lowering the ball. Very quick action."
2,Avoid this downrigger,up switch is latched up. cannon knows it. cannon has no fix. you will burn out the switch or the board or foul the cable to raise in incremental amounts. avoid this downrigger at any price.
4,6 inch cup brush,"I have only used the brush once and since I don't know how it may hold up under more use, I only rated it four stars. The one time I did use it, it did a very good job of removing rust, which is the reason I bought it. It seems to be well constructed and built to last."
5,How effectively do you manage your risks?,"As Arthur Anton, President/CEO, Swagelok succintly put it ""Chatterjee helps you take a fresh look at your company's current business model and gives you a roadmap to implement change to align your everyday operations and long-term strategic planning. This book is a must-read for anyone involved in operations and trying to grow a business."" This book sets the foundation for creative ways to leverage existing resources more effectively and mitigate risks."
1,Not what i though i was getting,"I was very much under the impression that this was going to work on my 2000 saab 9-5, as advertized by Amazon, but alas my mechanic could not get it to fit, and i had to pay double to get the right part locally. Initially excited because Moog is a good brand, disappointed it didnt work. But happily full return was available."
2,stopped working,"It was doing great. Lots of fun to play until today. It stopped working , so I tried changing batteries, but that hasn't helped. So I guess its a lemon. Susan Cantwell"
3,Fair,I bought this game recently. It has a lot of puzzles to choose from but the screen is black and white and a little hard to read. Other than that it works as advertised. Little pricey tough.
5,Exchange Bible,"I work for a company that provides exchange solutions. This is the end all be all of exchange guides. It may be a little bit overwehlming for a person just cutting their teeth on exchange but if you must understand exchange, this is your book.My spelling stinks."
4,Needs to be harder!,"Every engagement can be a special one in this artistic calender. The images are great artifacts which represent the Mexican culture. I suggest anyone with a sense of spunk get this great book.The only drawback is its flimsy cover. I would hope that future issues at least use a cardboard cover. It is a shame that with everyday use, the pages will bend and tear."
5,Dynamic and Practical!,"Lenore DeKoven's book on directing should be required reading for all directors. She preaches a straight forward and artistically rewarding process. Her book gives us all access to this process in a clear, concise way. As a director, you can really use her process as a shorthand to get the results you want from your actors, designers, your entire team. Stop reading this review and start reading the book! You won't regret it!"
5,"""Changing Direction..."" - A New Director's Handbook","Changing Direction is a great intro to the Directing world for anyone unfamiliar with just what a director does. Describing the many ""hats"" the director needs to wear, this book guides you from the day you first get the script, until it's ""in the can"".I work in a ""one man show"" broadcast studio, producing educational-type videos. I have never been to film school, so as a self-taught ""everything-guy"", this book allowed me to have an insight into an area of production that I needed help with.Anyone trying to make sense of this multi-faceted job is definitely advised to break this book open. You should not try to read cover-to-cover in one sitting: you'll miss too much, if you do! And believe me, you don't WANT to miss anything!"
2,Condition of book,"The story in this book, the writing and illustration are wonderful. My issue is with the physical condition of the book. I didn't realize I was ordering a used book, but that's OK, I'm glad to have done so. However, at least 6 pages were not attached to the book; I had to tape them in. Some pages were ripped and dog-eared. The book had a stamp from a public library. As I said, I'm all in favor of recycling books, but this one was unaccaptable. At a yard sale it wouldn't have gone for more than 50 cents. I paid $6+."
3,WELL WRITTEN AND HELPFUL,An extremely sound book. Whilst much of the instruction will be well known to the majority of readers attemping this style of work. There are some new gems. A very practical and helpful book - a definite library addition
2,"too many words, not enough content",The actual usable content of this book could have probably been written on four pages instead of 104. Common sense and a good service manual have the same information.
2,Eibach moved to China,"I must assume these work ok, they fit when I installed them. Otherwise I am wholly disappointed.The items in the picture are what Eibach used to give us but now the part is a rebadged Chinese knock-off. It is cheap stamped tubing and sheet metal, no CNC'd steel and aluminum, they don't even knock off the welding slag, so much for German engineering and pride."
4,Skin staplw remover kit,"The Item was shipped in good order, clean and sealed and ready for when it will be needed. Althought it looks cheap, it is made rather will."
5,Just what the doctor ordered,What can I say? This saved me a couple hundred-dollar visit to the doctor. I watch a video on YouTube to get the instructions of how to remove the staples from my son's head. The remover worked like a charm.
5,Looks Good,"Seems like it will do the job of removing skin staples. I haven't tried them out and hope not to. They're stored away, in the sanitary packaging, in my mega first-aid kit. Please take a comprehensive first aid course before even thinking about buying these."
4,Good price,Haven't used it yet fortunately but the only issue i have is the packaging which is a blessing and a potential problem. The packaging is flimsy which could be punctured or torn easily thereby contaminating the tool. On the other hand it isn't a bitch to get open in an emergency.
1,"I know I shouldnt be, but...","I was totally bored by this doc, and it looked so promising...Dont get me wrong, I am sorry she lost her family in the Holocaust, but her story is told very boringly in this doc. Also, it was in a Foreign language, so that didnt help either. I deeply regreted spending the money I did to see this."
4,satified customer,The canon pixmaa ip6000d photo printer is everything I thought it would be and more. Considering the price it was a steal. Should have bought it sooner. Have had it for a couple months now and the ink level still hasn't moved. Great features etc etc etc.
1,Complaint with Adorama who sold this printer,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. When he opened the box on Christams it was broken. Then the real problems began, we never got a reply or refund from Adorama until February 22, 2006. They ingnored our emails, phone calls, etc. Amazon stepped into the picture and contacted them. It still took numerous phone calls and emails to the company to get any satisfaction. I would never deal with this company again."
3,Good overall value,"This printer is of very good overall quality. However, I have a few reservations. Its media slots do not support Fuji's xD cards, and while the individual ink cartridges seem inexpensive, keep in mind that there are 6 cartridges to replace.The black ink cartridge is the same size as the other 5 (color) cartridges. Great for Canon's bottom line, but a pain for the rest of us. I do a moderate amount of printing and it seems as if there's always a cartridge running low.I'm pleased overall with the print quality. My last printer was an old Epson 770 stylus. This is a huge improvement in terms of speed, but I can't help wondering if there's something better out there.In short, a quick printer of very good quality. If you do a lot of printing, I'd recommend searching online for an ink-refill kit, or you'll be running to the office supply store more than you'd like."
2,Canon PIXMA iP6000D Photo Printer,"Printer did not meet all requirements. In spite of research of product materials, the printer does not read 2GB SD memory cards for direct print. Asked for Canon support to assist and they said that they had not tested the card on this older printer. I did not know that this was an ""older"" printer that would have limitations such as the one that I have described. This printer was sold as new."
5,So far So good,"I've had this for a couple of months now, photos look great and you can get cheap third party inks."
5,Korell ROCKS!,I suggest this CD to anyone! Hopefully the selling of his CD will encourage him to come out with another! Korell ROCKS!
1,Horrible quality- Do not buy a Phillips,"We purchased a Phillips 42"" plasma TV and it had constant problems. Now it is no longer working and cannot be fixed. WE had 2 different repair men look at the TV and they cannot get it to work. Never buy a Phillips. They have terrible quality and bad customer service."
2,Has no remote,"The picture was great but..... When the TV arrived it had no remote in the box. When I called Philips, they said they could not send me a remote; therefore, I boxed it up and sent it back. Very poor service from Philips."
1,TV will not start .. + Bad Customer Service,"I just bought this TV 5 weeks ago. I heard a noise and now TV won't power on (though I have a monster power surge protector). Called Philps as any one else would do. According to them, it can take upto 20 days for them to get one part, so I should wait before calling them again. I tried after a week, same response. I have been given a ref number.. thats it. In which world do we live in? 20 days for a service rep to come with a part? And they don't even know if the part ordered was a right part.. what if is doesn't work?I highly recommend that you think twice before buying a Philips TV. I did a mistake and would warn you."
1,"Poor customer service, also no remote control","I just received this tv and I also found no remote control in the box. Called Philips Customer Service and found them to be totally unhelpful. This TV has a good picture but for $3000 pricetag, a remote would be a nice thing to have. As of now, Philips Customer Service is unsure when I will get a remote and wouldn't even consider sending me a cheap $10 one to at least change the channels."
1,Do Not Buy,My tv is 2 years old and now dead. It started with a red flashing light and no sound and black screen. Just google phillips flat screen tv red flashing light and you will see many complaints about this issue.
1,avoid the expense,I paid $2000+ for mine and 60 days out of the warranty it popped and had no sound or picture. (red light flashes 7 times) I searched the webb and learned this is a very common story for this TV. It cannot be reasonably repaired and very few places even service this model in Central Indiana. I enjoyed it while it worked.
1,Terrible Product,"Bought this product as a refurbished item from the Phillips on-line store. Suddenly stopped working in the middle of game 5 of the NBA finals - first the picture went off, and then the sound. The green indicator light changed to a blinking red, and refused to even power off using either the remote button or the power button on the TV! Eventually had to unplug it to switch it off. Even though it's ""under warranty"", the only way to get any work done on it is to haul it to an authorized Phillip center, which is about 50 miles away. Checked on-line forums - apparently is a common, expensive problem with no easy solution. Had an independent, trusted TV repair man look at the problem - he immediately recommended scrapping the TV, and said it was a very common problem with Phillip TVs, and would cost at least $450 to fix. My strong recommendation is to never purchase a TV from Phillips!"
2,Do Not BUY!!!,I purchased this TV in 2008 from Aaron's it has the Ambilight which I love to death but on the negative side the picture stopped working sometime this year!! I am not sure how long these TV's are suppose to last but I think with the amount of money I paid for it I should receive more than 3 years of service. I took it to the shop for the second time and it should run me about $300 to get it fixed...I am stuck between a rock and a hard place because it is Christmas and I have to decide on whether or not to get my TV fixed or get another one!! My first plasma TV died on me too early...Buy if you want to I just pray you don't have the same problems I had...Happy Buying!!
4,The real ProjeKCt one,"Let's not beat around the bush ,if you are a fan of the King Crimson ProjeKCts then you will want to own this disc.Recorded shortly before the double trio's aborted Nashville Sessions and the resulting fractalisation of KC this disc is a splendid signpost to the future and also provides us with the opportunity to hear Trey Gunn and Robert Fripp open up and go for it for the first time.Clearly Fripp relishes working with Gunn in particular and plays with such obvious enthusiasm on this disc that it is an absolute joy to hear.This is some of his most passionate playing for years.More akin to ProjeKCt 4 than the quirky ( but fabulous) ProjeKCt 2 this is highly recommended"
1,Not my style,"I heard the first song and was thinking this was going to be an album of powerful, interesting melodies. The remainder is different, sounding harsh to the ears and avoiding reliable or compelling rhythms. The performers are talented, and have shone elsewhere, but not here."
5,EXCELLENT!,I thought this book was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed this book... you'll laugh out loud and you'll cry as you see everything through the eyes of one rural Minnesota doctor. I'm couldn't wait until his second one came out! Read it!!
5,Cristal D'Arques Longchamp sets,"I have several sizes. two sizes of wine goblets. compote dishes, champagne flutes, Liqueur. they are beautiful, heavy. lovely to use."
3,Gift for Parents,"I think this camera is alright. The camera was a gift to my not so techno advanced parents. They are able to use the camera easy enough. With out having to go through to many screens to delete, and so forth. The printer is another story. After trying to explain it at least 5 times, with something going wrong EACH time, they still dont get it. The required paper is not standard, and can be put in the wrong way. I did not know the colors were printed one at a time either, or I would have purchased something else."
3,i have this!,"I almost have a BA degree in photography and much art experience, but have not been involved for many years in even amateur areas of photography.I think I bought this in 2005, the whole kit, and even bought an extended warranty through Office Max. But I barely used it as a camera, maybe a total of less than 36 shots. However, I own it, have quite a few of its ""Oly"" cards, and can do the Panorama shots. I need to use it and its printer as a starting point to decide where to progress to without making mistakes in buying the wrong products. I also wonder if I should stay with Olympus or move to Canon, Nikon, or someone else."
5,Excellent Treatment for Depression!,"Dr. Shen's Free & Easy has been a blessing to us! My spouse had been going through a terrible bout of depression directly related to his work place. It was more of an anxiety type issue. I have used another Dr. Shen's product for colds for several years with excellent results, so I decided to give this a try, too. There were days that he would absolutely be beside himself with stress, just thinking about going to work. Sometimes to the point of tears of frustration. After using Free & Easy for a week he was totally back to normal. I'm here for my second purchase of this product and wanted to be sure to leave a comment in favor of this product for others to review."
2,Herbs in Alka Balance are too strong for me...,"I was really hoping this would work for me, but I had to stop taking this product after 3 days due to the extreme reaction I was having to the herbs in the supplement. About 2 hours after taking it (2 tablets), I found I would get super jittery, as if I'd had 3 cups of coffee. I would also get dizzy, nauseated, and start sweating profusely, even if I was just sitting at my desk working. This lasts all day long, so I had to stop taking it.So Alka Balance may work for some, but it's too strong for me. From what I've read, Burdock root can cause these symptoms, so I'm pretty sure that this was what I was reacting to.As a note, I don't have problems swallowing pills, but these things are giant and if you have problems with larger tablets, you might have a problem with these.I'm going to try to find a green food supplement instead and hope that works for me."
5,Works well,"Of all the products I've used to balance my ph level, this is the one that works most consistently. It lowers my acidity by at least 3 points when I take it."
2,Watch your step with Noronha!,"The Noronha EN<>PT (Brazilian) legal dictionary has so many poor and downright wrong translations of legal terms that you have to be VERY careful when using it. No translator in his/her right mind would use it as a sole reference source. Every entry has to be double-checked and compared to the definitions of a good monolingual legal dictionary, such as Placido de Silva's Vocabulario Juridico or Black's. The price listed here is also very steep. Now if you're desperate for an English<>Portuguese legal dictionary go ahead and buy it. At any rate, it's not as if there is a wide range of similar dictionaries to choose from in this language pair. But please, DO be careful!"
5,from its birth shark is driven by a unique instinct.. Hunger,I could never write a review about a jens bjernebö book.... He left to the world his masterpieces to read and comprehend and love. A hypersensitive book about brutality. A hymn to human heart.
4,FUNKY MELODY -- Stevie B,"One of his best, yet. A bass-thumpin CD. And it even has the original THUMP version of one of the most famous of Hmong Love Anthems: ""WAITING FOR YOUR LOVE"". Each song has it's own unique Stevie B beat to it and the bass is sure to POUND your ear drums the Stevie B way. So, to all my Hmong brothers and sisters, I say...if you're a Stevie B lover, you gotta get his CD!"
5,Stevie B's best yet,This album is his best work ever I have heard every song he ever did and most of the best ones are on this CD!
3,"Good scope for the price, but only with the 30X eyepiece.","Optically this spotting scope is really very good with the fixed power 30X eyepiece. The image is very bright and sharp and the field of view is decent. It's hard to find much fault with it.I cannot recommend the zoom lens as its field of view and image quality just don't compete with many newer scopes nor does it come close to the quality of the 30X fixed power eyepiece. Sadly it appears this eyepiece is no longer being made by Bushnell. If you can find the 30X eyepiece, it's still a good value even though you have to buy it with the zoom eyepiece. The zoom may satisfy some, but if you want very good image quality, use the 30X or go with another (admittedly more expensive) scope.I give it three stars because as it comes (with the 20-60x zoom) it's mediocre. If you can find it, the 30X is a great and cheap upgrade."
3,VERY basic stuff,"For what it is, this book does a good job of introducing newbies to audio production. It claims to be for intermediate recordists too, but that is a stretch. If you have any experience recording anything at all, this book will probably not be very helpful. There is a section near the end that mentions some newer microphone arrays for recording in surround. To me this seems too advanced for beginners, but does not offer enough detail for veterans to really implement. I was disappointed in this book for being so utterly basic, but that could be terrific for other readers who need to be walked through the process setp-by-step."
5,T-Rex Lovers Project,This book is awesome if you are very into dinosaurs and want to know how to assemble a skeleton. My son loved this book. He wants to be a paleontologist and this was a great way for him to learn about dinosaur bones. It is time consuming. You have to plan out assembling this dinosaur. You need to have all of your supplies in order and give time to prepare the bones. I would save this project for kids that are a little older-5th grade on up. It's a little too in depth for a younger child.Do not expect to have this project assembled in a weekend. It requires patience. But you will have a one of a kind dinosaur. You get recipes for chicken in the back of this book.
5,Gran historia,"Uno de los mejores libros de vampiros escrito. Muy ameno y agilmente escrito. Estilísticamente están mejor los siguientes de la serie, con los que debió de esmerarse más puesto que ya era famosa. Éste fue en principio un relato breve que luego extendió, y eso se advierte, pues las descrociones no son tan prolijas como por ejemplo en Lestat el Vampiro. Aunque no me gustan en especial los libros de vampiros Anne Rice escribe tan bien que cualquier cosa suya parece verídica y se lee muy bien. Cien por cien recomendable."
5,"It is very sexy, and thriller at the same time.","I enjoyed reading the book, and then watching the movie. I think it would have been great if the director of the movie would have included the whole book in the movie. I just wish they make Vampire lestad, and then the whole chronicles."
2,A bit disapointing,"I wanted this book to give me details missing on record album covers and/or record labels. I collect Old Time Kiddie Records for my web site. I wanted to have the dates of release. But, if it isn't published on the original records themselves, it isn't in the book. As for a complete listing of all Kiddie Records and a brief history, this book does serve that purpose."
2,Had to force myself to read this,"I am an elementary teacher and have a tendancy to read more childrens books than adult books. This book was only 87 pages long but took me just as long to read as some 300-400 page books I picked up over the summer. I actually had to force myself to finish reading it. While I think that the story idea itself was interesting, the characters were not very well developed and the events seemed to jump from one to another rather too quickly. Definitely the worst book I read this summer...I will not be taking back to school in the fall and recommending it to my students."
4,Nice young-adult sci-fi short story,"I think my perception may be biased in favor of this book because I both read and write young-adult sci-fi. And looking at how thin this book is, I went into it expecting a short story, not a novel. And I got just what I was looking for -- a fun, quick read paced for young teens. I enjoyed it. At the same time, I understand other reviews of this book that wanted the depth of a full-length novel. Frankly, I agree I would have enjoyed having more meat on the bones of this book and that it would have been even better. But that's not what it is. It's a short story written for middle grades. And a fun one."
4,Maybe the Julia Child of Chinese Cooking in America!,"I started to get interested in cookbooks since I read Julia Child's book, ""My Life in France."" Anyway, Madame Grace Chu was a legendary Chinese gourmet chef. I found this cookbook at a thrift store and I bought it out of curiousity. The book has plenty of information regarding Chinese cuisine and the art of Chinese cooking. I believe the book to be useful if I was a cook but since I'm not. I can't say if the recipes work or not so don't ask me. I would have liked to have seen photographs and pictures about the food."
5,Visions of Surgarplums:,"This is a Cookbook of Cakes, Cookies, Candies & Confections that celebrates Christmas in other countries.The book cost 1 cent because the cover is ripped and torn. The book itself is in good condition. I felt like I had received a family keepsake, a treasure.I purchased the book because I like to read and was curious how Christmas is celebrated in other countries.Baking is fun, relaxing and is healthier when it is homemade."
4,nice cookbook for christmas goodies,"This is a very nice cookbook with an international sampling of recipes for christmas traditional desserts. The only drawback is there really aren't many pictures of the finished product, but if you are familiar with the recipe, this isn't a problem. I found several old recipes my grandmother and great grand mother prepared but I didn't have the recipe for. I bought this so that I could pass those recipes down to my duaghter and granddaughter. A wonderful addition to the library of cookbooks."
5,Exceptional Deal,Excellent cookbook in great condition. The price was very reasonable and I was impressed with the speed of transaction. I am very satisfied with my experience with Amazon.
5,I got a great value!,"I was pleased to receive the book ""The Last One Home Is A Green Pig"". I had been wanting to locate this book from my adult child's past to share with her young son. The book was in excelent condition and arrived quickly. He will be excited to get this great gift from his Mommy's past on Christmas morning."
1,"Lid was not included, item returned.","Not able to do a great review on this because product was not completely sent. Lid was not included in my shipment. I give it a 1 star because of that. Bread did seem to fit in the canister well (Sara Lee Sandwich). Amazon returned the product no questions asked. Hopefully if you order, you get all pieces. Good luck."
3,Stuck together,#1 I ordered 2 and they came stuck inside each other. Can't get them apart yet. #2 They have a strong odor. #3 you can only fit the regular sized white bread loaves in them. I use the more common wider bread. I also would have like to have been able to use it for homemade bread.
4,bread box,I have used this product for years. My old one finally broke. This product keeps my bread fresh for over a week.
5,Simply a great product,"When I originally saw this, I bought it to keep my bread safe from the cat. Silly cat won't eat a sandwich but she loves to tear open the bread bag and gnaw on a few slices. I thought I had a mouse at first, but no, it was the cat!Anyway, when I got it I thought it was just a plastic bread box, but pulling the bag out around the edges as designed works very well. You get a tight and total seal, something you will never get with a tie band. Even worse, if you are like me and lose the tie band then you have a loose knot in the bag. The bread stays fresh, is easy to get to, plus you can stand this on end and keep it out of the way on your counter. The cat hasn't even noticed that it has the bread in it. Yet."
5,Fresh bread longer,This storage unit keeps the loaf of bread for much longer than in a cabinet. We have two for defferent kinds of bread. One for wheat and one for white bread. Sturdy with a snap on lid. The holes in the bottom help with placing the bread in the container with out crushing the bread.
2,NOT GREAT FOR CAMPING,Got it to take camping not knowing it had 4 HOLES in the bottom not good for bugs and wild animals.
5,soft bread!,no more moldy or dried out bread. this little box is worth every penny. i only wish i could get extra lids. i have 2 more with broken lids.
4,nice,This was bought for my brother as he had bug problems in his house and they would get in his bread and cereals. So this was perfect.
1,No mystery here. Thats a negative one star.,"This movie did not need remaking, re-releasing to the big screen yes. What mr zombie has done is to take away the mystery and questions of the original, and replaced it with a white trash cliff notes version. Its plain to see with such foul mouthed and nasty parents that the poor kid turning into a rampaging maniac was no big mystery. Watch it if ya want, I thought it was pathetic. Futhermore, Michael myers did not need to be some gigantic wwf wrestler to be intimidating in the orginal. In RZ's version I kept waiting for him to pile drive his victims. FAIL. Rob go back to the music studio... thanks."
1,Director's Cut Sucks,"I saw Halloween when it was release in Theaters and I loved the film. So when it came out on DVD, I went out and bought the Director's Cut to see what was added. I discovered that one of my favorite scenes was replaced! In the theatrical release, Micheal escaping from the guards was just a fun scene, but Rob Zombie felt 'it wasn't real enough,' so he replaced it with a rape scene.So, Micheal breaking lose and killing a handful of guards, or two guys break into Micheal's cell to rape a girl (WTF) and Micheal just walks out (and kills the two guys). The director's cut also including pointless things like fading to black and it reading ""Halloween night."" Zombie must think his fans are retarded that we couldn't figure that out.If you watch the director's cut and hated the movie, I don't blame you. But give the film another try and watch the theatrical release, it's way better. It's amazing, ask anyone who saw it in theaters.Director's Cut- 0 out of 0Theatrical Release- 4 out of 5"
3,"Movie good, process even better.","The movie itself was good, as far as horror movies go. It had a great back story. I ordered it for someone else to watch. I'm not a big horror movie fan. However, the process for ordering instant videos was fantastic. Many titles and very easy to use."
2,Case broken,When I received this movie it was cracked all along the back spine ... Not a great addition to my collection overall !
5,Good Zombie Halloween,"I really did enjoy the first installment of Halloween by Rob Zombie. Good Special features and a good movie. The second movie, on the other hand just sucked."
3,A pleasent surprize,"Okay, at first I wasn't all thrilled at the idea of remake. But, I very surprized to see that Rob Zombie did a very well job of remaking the film. Zombie even attempted to take it a step further with trying offer an explaination as what made Myers into the monster known as ""the Shape"". What even made the film more interesting, was that for the first time. Halloween fans got a chance to hear Myers actually speak. The acting was very good for this time. Especially, that boy who played the younger Myers. He did an excellent job."
1,Again?,Is it just me? Am I the only one sick of re-releases. Why even bother buying it when it comes out if they are going to release a better version ten times over in the coming years?
1,And this was remade because....?,"Absolutely awful in every way. No style. No thrills. No suspense. The script and characters are cardboard and plot holes (like what happened to the sheriff after he found his daughter?) plague this dud. Yes, I know, horror films are noted for brilliant narratives but the original was effective in its simplicity. Michael's back story took way too long -- was it even needed? -- and there was no sense of climax. The only thing this film proves is that Malcolm McDowell should have retired after his classic turn in ""A Clockwork Orange."" His overacting is an embarrassment, albeit just one in this not-worth-watching remake."
3,A decent remake but..,"This is a decent remake, no where near as good as carpenters Halloween movies but none the less a decent film. Carpenter's Halloween is a 5 star film, this remake however is not even in that class. I am a Huge Halloween fan, I just didn't feel like this wa a true Halloween Michael Myers film. This remake is no where near as good as the TCM remake, but over all it's a decent popcorn movie at 3 stars."
3,Really upset,"Ok one I guess I was part of the select few who like the theatrical version. I liked the scene where he took on 4 guards to bust out like that. Only MM can pull that off but this scene is gone from the 2 disc unrated version. It's replaced by a disturbing rape scene with a new mental female patient, and two cheesy guards who decide to take the woman to Michael's room to be raped. Then he gets up after 15 seconds of them doing this bad rape scene, to crushing them to death. So if you are like me, and liked that particular part of the movie, then I would not pick this up. I am trying to find out if that scene is in the regular rated R version because I just do not understand how you take that scene out of the movie, to be replaced by this rape scene. If anyone else knows, would be very helpful. Other than that, it's a good 2 disc set, with good funny bloop takes, and deleted scene out takes. I just do not like the fact the break out scene is replaced with another scene."
4,not bad at all!,"i must say...........im not a big fan of the halloween movies,but this movie really was good to me! im just waiting for rob zombie to make part two!"
1,A RIP OFF,"This version is a ripoff,the theatre version is great,but this dvd version sucks so much is cut out,the alternate ending is the original,do not buy this version"
5,HALLOWEEN UNRATED,"This DVD was absolutely AWESOME !!! A Very, on the edge of your seat, thriller. Good to see Michael Myers back in action."
3,A unique remake that lacks the horror,"I did like how Rob Zombie made this remake very different from the original 1978 masterpiece of horror. Most horror film remakes today are the exact same film with bigger production values and zero horror. At least Rob made something totally fresh, though it has many flaws. I liked Michael Myers much better when I knew nothing about him. Now he is given a more realistic abused past and thus makes him human. Big mistake. The acting is decent enough for a horror film, but even the original wasn't the best acted film, so I can't really knock this one too much in that department. I think this is the third best film in the Halloween series after Halloween and Halloween II. Hallween 4 was okay, but all the rest aren't worth watching."
4,Good Effort by Rob Zombie,"I know alot of die-hard fans of the original Halloween hate this film..but you gotta give credit to Rob Zombie,for taking on probally the best Horror movie of all time.As a fan of the original film myself,I gotta say,that I liked this movie.I thought the whole idea of showing us Michael's childhood and upbringing,was really cool.It gave us an idea,to what made him snap.Including his mother's emotional abusive boyfriend and how Michael was harrassed and bullied at school.I thought it was a really good idea to get us familiar with the character of Michael Myers,before turning into a full-blown killer.I also liked how Rob Zombie made Myers into more of a realistic type of killer and not some supernatural unstoppable monster or something.Overall,If you haven't seen this re-make before and loved the orginal....I say give it a chance.You might like it too."
1,Awful,"To call this movie garbage would be an insult to garbage. I was really hoping that this would turn out. There were some decent ideas that RZ infused into this project. There were just a lot of bad ideas as well. The way he turned Michael into a hillbilly was completely preposterous. Besides that if he would have removed the whole middle section of the film. Where he humanizes a character that is scary because of how inhuman he is, it would have helped the film. Michael is also poorly cast, he is way too huge. It looks humorous.So in conclusion...all of the creepy moments from the original are gone as is all of the quality. Two thumbs way down."
1,Did We Really Need This Flick?,"It's so typical that the notion of Michael Myers simply being born evil is essentially thrown out the window and replaced with the usual boy-within-a-dysfunctional-family deal. How very 21st century and how very lame. Besides the fact that I have been immune to these movies since the late 1980's, this film was a waste of my time. The only highlights were the appearances of Ken Foree (from the superior original version of ""Dawn Of The Dead"") and Micky Dolenz (of the 1960's band and TV show ""The Monkees""). Other than that, ho hum. It's also too long.Note to Hollywood: please stop with the remakes. Get some creative people in there and give us something new and fresh. Don't be afraid to try a worthwhile idea that does not require reaching back into the past. John Carpenter's superior ""Halloween"" was 1978. It should be left alone."
4,Back to the basics of brutality,"No fancy over-exaggerated stunts or effects that just end up looking stupid and fake. All kept very real and very brutal. This kid portrays an anger and frustration that I think anyone can relate to. The killings are frighteningly realistic and bloody. Even though machete wielding Jason may still be my favorite, Rob Zombie's Micheal can definitely teach Freddy and Jason a lesson in evil.4 stars and not 5 because the story could have stayed a bit more true to the original; but it's still a fantastic movie on it's own."
1,Dreadful & Dismal,"Dreadful script + Terrible director + Needless remake = Dismal film.Absolutely one of the all-time worst remakes ever brought to the screen. Zombie completely misses the mark (as usual) on what truly makes a film scary and horrifying, instead he parades his usual cast of gritty, scummy, trailer park trash characters onto the screen for what is a dismal example of bad film making."
4,"Zombie played with fire, but it worked!","Ok - I totally denounced this film upon it's announcement. I went from thinking Zombie was a god (1000 Corpses, Rejects) to cursing him. Well... this movie was AWESOME! Aside from Carpenter's original, and let's face it, Halloween II (best sequel EVER), this is the most incredible, scary, Halloween film there is. It's got everything I and II have - storyline, atmosphere, incredible camera work, and brilliant lighting. The films that SHOULD be scorned are H20 and Resurrection. Those are pieces of trash that ignore the entire series in some sort of sick sense of self-entitlement to rewrite everything. While it seemed this would fall into the same, it absolutely DOES NOT."
1,Zombie should stop making movies,"It seems that Rob Zombie's Halloween is a love-it-or-hate kind of thing. Well, that places me firmly in the HATE IT category. The main problem I have with the story is how much time is devoted to Michael Myers' troubled childhood. So, little Mikey is picked on at school, he kills animals, and his homelife truly sucks. So...are we supposed to feel sympathy when he becomes a raging psychopath? I certainly didn't.And, since this is a Rob Zombie film, you have to include virtually non-stop profanity, sickening violence and thoroughly loathesome characters. Others have menioned that Myers' mother was the lone sympathetic character in the film. And she's a stripper. Not much sympathy there, either.Look, I LIKE horror movies. And I like the original Halloween and maybe about half of the sequels. But this thing is just pitiful. There's no suspense, no levity at all, just 2 hours of in-your-face filth and violence. I can't imagine what anyone sees in this garbage."
1,Michael Myers was a member of Slipknot?,Wait. Young children exposed to awful parents and mean schoolmates and promiscuous siblings become serial killing slashers?Where is Dee Snyder? Because he also is not gonna take it.
2,S.O.S.,"I was very dissapointed in this movie. It made 30 mil on its first weekend because Halloween fans will always go see the movies. I was hoping for more imagination than just a bunch of teenagers who we don't care anything about going around trying to get layed before getting killed. Useless sex, violence and language. Not very much of a reinvisionment if you ask me. But we should have know, it was by Rob Zombie"
3,Too much gore,"I really enjoyed the original movie, and thought the remake looked really interesting. I knew it would take on a different twist, especially since I looked at the spoilers on Wikipedia. However, I didn't realize it would show the murders. I left the movie after the first act finished, as I was numbed and tired from seeing the beatings/murders in their entirety. The original was better in that the scenes cut away during the beatings. The viewer still knew the victims were being murdered; watching the scenes in the remake was so unnecessary. The music was sensational and I loved the inclusion of the original Halloween theme. The backstory was clever (I differ from the reviewers who said the remake gave too much away). Still, I was very disappointed with all the gore shown. I long for the movies where the story was more about creepy than blood and gore. I think I'll go rent the original at Blockbuster now."
2,Could have been better,"I am a big Fan of the Halloween franchise but I have to say that this movie did not live up to the original Halloween movie. The reason why I say this is because I think (if this is possible) there was too much gore in this movie. I know that is kind of the point of a horror movie, but I think Rob Zombie went over board.However, it was cool to see Mike Myers again!! Lets hope that Halloween 2 (directed by Rob Zombie) turns out better."
3,Good remake of a classic.,"This is a good remake of an classic. Although Rob Zombie's movies are typically over the top in gore this one appeared to be slightly toned down. I liked the new take on Michael Myers. Rob gave him a little more background and the physical presence to match the emotional rage the original character must have felt. I think the key to Rob Zombie evolving into one of the ""Horror Masters"" is going to be him learning to leave a slight bit to the imagination. I see him playing with this concept in this movie as compared to some of his others."
3,This is the complete opposite of the original,"Rob Zombie definitely put his bloody, severed thumbprint on this version. I was a bit disappointed. I missed the mastery of suspense the original had. This one was as subtle as a pick axe to the temple. If you want the blood and gore of a modern first person shooter video game, this is the version for you. If you are more on the cinematic side of horror movies, skip this one and watch the original."
1,Too Much Trashy Language,I watched this movie a couple of times and tried to give the film some credit for awhile. Eventually I through the film a way because I could not overlook the trashy cussing and dirty language that was used through out the film over and over anymore.
1,Horrible Re-Make!,This was a horrible Re-Make of the original Halloween!-story is not even the same! Movie should be rated X! Don't watch movie with any kids around!
3,Should have been better,"It was ok. What was up with that rape scene though? This movie should have been so much better. It just didnt have that effect the original had. There are 2 people who should stay away from movies, Uwe Boll and Rob Zombie."
3,Doesn't Have The Scares Of The Original,"Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" feels like it's missing something.I did like ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" but not ""Devil's Rejects"".And by the end of halloween you feel as if something important is missing.Scares?Thrills?They're there but hidden under a mess that,like Roger Ebert said about ""seed of chucky"", is 2 movies.A prequal,an a gore driven remake.The biggest problem is that the movie isn't given time to grow.It's plot moves too fast and throws stuff at us without giving us time to take in the scene."
1,whack to the 10th power,"This was a corney movie, this was a waste of my time and boaring just a different remake on the original but this shows little michel seeing a pshychiatrist, and killing more then just his sister. Rob zombie is a bad director for this crappy movie, this was garbage."
1,Pretty bad,If I could put a Zero I would. I did not like this movie in any way shape or form. If you gave it a 5 then something is wrong with you. Maybe I am just a big fan of the original but I still tried to give this movie a chance being a Rob Zombie fan and all. I loved house of 1000 Corpses but did not care for Devil's Rejects. I honestly liked the fact that you did not go into Michael's childhood. Thats what made him mysterious. We saw enough in the original to know he was not white trash so I did not get that. This movie spent to much time on his childhood for my taste. To many sex scenes and I don't dig rape scenes. I don't even understand the point of adding that into the movie. Also such bad acting. People seem to forget that the original was an Indie movie with no high priced actors or props just great scenes that scared you until the end. Zombie had enough money to do a good job and he did not. Hail to John Carpenter still the KING! I hated it and I always will.
1,Did Rob Zombie even watch the origional?,"I was pretty excited about the remake...I am a huge fan of the origional. Rob Zombie ruined Mike Meyers story. The Meyers were not white trash, they were a regular middle class family. That's what made it scary! Mike was just the boy next door. Rob Zombie just sucks...I can't believe that any real fan would destroy the orgional vision the way he did."
4,BETTER THAN ORIGINAL!!,MOST PPL HATE ON ROB ZOMBIES VERSIONS. I NOT ONLY ENJOYED THEM BUT I THAUGHT THEY WERE BETTER!!! GIVE IT A CHANCE
3,Getting In Depth With Michael...,I never really liked any of the movies in the halloween series because I just never understood what was so menacing about michael. This film gives a much closer look into what forms michael and how almost completely inhuman he becomes. I think it is much better made a lot of people give it credit just because they don't like Zombie. This film was very well done and actually makes michael more then just a stalker in a mask.
2,Don't mess with a classic.,"Halloween directed and written and directed by Rob Zombie (of all people!) is a terrible remake of the 1978 classic. It's a new take on Halloween, the characters have more of a back story and jeez there's a lot of blood and nudity in this one, this film doesn't work at all. The dialogue is cheesy and lame as hell, Zombie isn't a literary god not even a little. The acting is embarrassing, I can't believe Zombie couldn't find any decent actors and of course he put his real-life wife in this as Michael Myers mother, she plays a stripper! Thank god I have the original to fall back on, this remake was a complete waste of time!"
1,Worst remake ever,There really isnt anything new about remakes not being successful but i couldnt stand this movie im glad that i work at a movie theatre so i didnt have to pay to see it. I already own the original and love it this is what horror movies should be like more scarier in zombies case he wanted it to be more bloody gory and trashy rather than make it scarier so it could beat the classic but nothing could be a classic but it could have been just as good this is so not worth the money nor time.
1,Horrible pointless,There is no reason this movie was remade other than money. It is horrible and pointless just as the many sequels were. What makes me the most sad is that some kid in the next 10 years will read a review of how Halloween is on the list of best horror movies ever made and will pick up this garbage instead of the original. Art is dying this is proof.
1,worst remake yet,Don't take your white trash kid out trick or treating and he'll snap and murder the entire family. Then he will go to the nut house where apparently there is a great workout and gym system so he can get as big and strong as hulk hogan. There are three very different versions of this same film. This leads me to believe that even the director wasn't sure of the tale or that the producers weren't fond of his vision and forced re-shoots. Sounds like a disaster in progress. Zombie said he would never do a sequel and guess whats coming out August 2009. Way to keep creative integrity.
3,This is very brutal,"Whether you saw the theatrical or director's cut, unless you're a die-hard Rob Zombie fan, (and I'm not!)this film is not owner's material.The language is way too constant, and the violence is needlessly graphic.If John Carpenter really wanted his film re-made, he should've done it himself, or gotten any other director to do it, besides Rob Zombie, he doesn't have the slightest idea what he's doing and should continue writing music, and retire from directing.I give this film 3 stars for two reasons: Malcolm McDowell and the explanation for what made Michael go nuts, this is rent-material only."
1,time waste,"If you're a fan of the original, maybe enough of a fan to be curious about this one... STAY AWAY! You will feel like you've wasted part of you life and tarnished a memory of a good film. Zombie claims writing & directing credits? With so much dialogue and camera shots ripped directly off of the original, I think not. Zombie only has 2 tricks in his movies- sadistic, violent gore & insane characters. Maybe the insanity of the characters made sense in House of 1,000 Corpses, but here almost everyone behaves as if they are high on drugs and sex crazed. I'm a teacher- believe me- NO ONE in High School behaves like these characters. It's just a waste of time."
4,Very good movie,"Rob Zombie does a great job, actually I am not a fan of his previous movies but I love the original version of this movie so I wanted to see what rob zombie did to it. I love what he did with micheal meyers as a child, it makes you feel a little sorry for him and you kind of root for him. The one bad thing about this is the actor who played sam loomis in rob zombie's halloween did not do a very good job, his dialogue did not feel natural too me, it seemed kind of cumbersome."
2,Pseudo-shocking tripe,"Rob Zombie's Halloween is a pathetic attempt to remake an even more pathetic original. To a risibly threadbare story line, Zombie adds horrible acting by a trio of dumb bimbos, profane language solely for shock value, and a cliched introductory sequence offering a glimpse into Michael Myers's past. As a horror buff, I can't understand the seemingly widespread attraction to depictions of senseless gore (e.g., the truck stop bathroom scene, the introductory throat slicing scene of the stepfather). The power of horror to scare lies in forces unseen or psychological demons, not marauding oafs following their victims in plain view. Such obvious sensationalist tripe as Zombie's directorial efforts should only impress those with IQs of 80. The only thing I would like to see Michael Myers do is time travel back to 1978 and bludgeon the whole inane series out of its misery.Grade: D"
5,Loved this Halloween,"After the original Halloween, all the rest of them, to me, SUCKED! I hate remakes of great movies. But, there are exceptions to every rule and this is one! In this Halloween, the first half of the movie shows you Michael Myers as a kid and a bit of background on him-it's not boring at all, it's totally great and the kid is creepy! Then the second half, stays very, very close to the Original Halloween movie from long ago, but doesn't seem repetative! I was so psyched when I saw this movie. By the way, the cast was right on!"
4,Rob Zombie's Halloween is up to Par,"Rob Zombie's Halloween based off of John Carpenters retells the story, but not just that, it goes farther and shows what Michael Myers childhood was like. Definitely more suspenseful then the original and just as entertaining. However, this movie is much more graphic and is definitely above and beyond your typical new slasher film with a twist of Rob Zombie's humor added in as well. One thing I do complain about is that Rob has to put his damn wife in every movie he does. Don't get me wrong I like her and she is very attractive, but sometimes you just have to get someone else. With her being in it, it brings back a House of a Thousand Corpses vibe or Devils Rejects. Despite that this movie is definitely worth a view...."
2,Zombie's Abomination,"What in the blue hell was this? As much I love horror, I almost considered walking out of this movie in the theater b/c of sheer boredom.. And stupidity. Like everyone else, the main problem is that I must accept Michael Myers was a Kiss loving redneck with a stripper mother and a slutty sister. No one told Rob the secret of making a great movie: Less history, more mystery.. I understand what he's trying to do, but making him a moronic bloodthirsty killer is not his style, that's reserved for Jason Vorhees. This would've been a decent film if it had nothing to do with the Halloween franchise, but this one will be in the dollar bin soon enough, and we can all forget it ever happened."
5,One of the Best Remakes,"Of all the horror movie remakes in recent years, this is at the top of the list in my opinion. Rob Zombie made this Halloween franchise fan proud with this film. I think that he did a great job of giving the Michael Myers backstory, and I feel the same way about the second half of the movie, which tells the story of Michael's return to his hometown and the stalking of his sister. Overall, I just really enjoy this movie. Thumbs up, Rob."
3,Not bad at all,"Typical horror movie, where the bad guy never falls. But still, Rob did a good job with this. Good thrills here and there. Ill warn you now, avoid the sequel. Its TERRIBLE"
5,Rob all the way,"Man their are some major haters on rob zombie, jeez people this movie was a masterpiece & so was part 2 & so will be any movie rob zombie touches in the near future, like i said this movie was plain awesome & if you don't have it then your not a true Halloween fan & that's just the facts =)"
4,Ok,Movie is good like the childhood scenes but not very appealing for pic quality for blu ray have seen much better but still not bad would recommend picking up!
2,????,"When I received this product it was not wrapped, I tried to watch this movie and was able to get 40 minutes into it and the DVD froze and would not allow ANY function. I wrote to the seller and they got back to me in a few days by email and said they would replace the product and send me a prepaid envelope for me to return the bad copy. Well after I received the second copy it again was not sealed and I watched it but this time it went on for about 50 minutes and then froze, again no function was allowed. I was pretty upset and emailed them again and said no more copies I would like a refund because in my email I stated what I thought the problem was; this sticker that was on the actual DVD, but both copies had it on there. I finally found the movie at Wal Mart after about 1 month or so of trying to get a copy that would play from this seller."
4,Was a good movie.,"Well I don't remember much of the original, it's been awhile since I've watched it (I need to buy the series), but I don't think it was as bad as what some people on here make it out to be. I don't remember if it showed it in the original, but I liked how it shows some of his childhood, made me understand what he went through and everything a little more. Also I personally liked how the mask looked aged once he grew up, I know some people didn't like it, but it made it more realistic since that's what would of happened to it, it wouldn't of stayed brand new looking after all those years."
3,Meh.,"If you're a fan of the series, hopefully you'll accept this one. Not as good as most of the other ones but at least it's launching a sequel."
3,Zombie Does White Trash,Nobody does white trash like Rob Zombie does white trash. The guy just has an eye for it. He knows how to pick the perfect cast and how to make their 'trashiness' funny. This was a pretty entertaining movie on its own but comparing it to the origional? I gotta go with John Carpenters version. It was just chilling. This movie was more a Rob Zombie 'Devils Rejects' kind of white trash exploitation movie.
3,UNRATED DIRECTORS CUT,"This is going to sound really odd, but I prefer the Theatrical Version because of one scene. In the Director Cut, they replaced the escape scene of him killing four guards, to a totally not needed rape scene. I think the rape scene didn't help film but made me wish I got the Theatrical Version. In August when I first saw Halloween, the escape scene was one of my favorite scenes. The whole two guards raping a girl in Michael's room just seemed stupid, and it made me feel like I was watching Devil's Rejects, insteed of Halloween.If you want rape and a really lame escape buy the directors cut. If you want to see Michael take out four guards, Theatrical Version. Other than the escape scene, the directors cut is pretty neat, but trust me, you want miss anything."
3,Mixed Feelings,"The film is scary and Rob Zombie is a talented film maker with a distinctive style.My one hangup about the film is the creation of an ""origin story"" for Mike Meyers.The circumstances leading up to his career as a homicidal maniac are a little cliche: he comes from a dysfunctional family with an abusive father.The creepiness of the original Mike Meyers is that he was a seeming normal child from a normal home who one day murders his sister for no discernible reason.So for that, it looses points. Otherwise a great flick."
1,NO good,Rob Zombie's Halloween is second to none or should I say second to Run this movie stinks Tyler Mane is not Michal Myers At all. Michal Myers is scary not a Wresler . I did't really see all the movie but i saw parts of it but if I saw this film in theaters I would like to make like a banana and peal Out. I may H2 the day before Halloween it may stink so bad ill have to Drop my Cloths of at the dry cleaners with me in them. so dont buy it
2,Hallloween,I bought this for my brother last Christmas. I personally didnt like it. In one scene a girl gets raped so if that kind of thing bothers you this may not be for you. That kind of thing in a movie turns me right off. I think the original was better.
4,Zombie's Halloween,"Rob Zombies's Halloween is awesome way better then the original. Zombies take and style is brutal and disturbing which makes this movie great. Zombie's intense style of camera shots is what makes this movie roll. It's right in your face and keeps you on the edge.I love how some scene's Zombie shakes the camera with the the music being intense while Michael is attacking someone. The lighting and sound effects are brilliant. The back story of young Michael is creepy and makes him more human instead of some guy just in a mask killing people who is invincible.I just want to say thank you Mr. Zombie for making the Halloween franchise scary again. This is just and all around good movie ,just don't come into this comparing it to the original. Think of it as a another movie on it's own. Just watch it and enjoy it."
2,By-the-numbers and completely forgettable,"Nothing makes a monster less terrifying than giving him a sympathetic backstory. Rob Zombie's re-imagining of the Carpenter classic succeeds exactly where it SHOULDN'T: it humanizes the main villain.Audience mindset: ""Oh, of COURSE he turned out that way! Poor kid, he's been through so much. Oh well, la dee dah...la dee dah. Okay, now the movie is in its second half and we can watch the carnage, which is really why we came, right? We didn't come to see a well-made movie or an intelligent script. We came for the carnage.""This film is unchallenging and disappointing. I'm sure the kiddies will love it because it is loud, violent, and viceral. But most intelligent film-goers will dislike or even resent this movie for its endless list of flaws. It is a popcorn movie, nothing more. It will soon be forgotten by nearly everyone."
5,Perfect,I was not to thrilled with some of Rob Zombie's earlier films but this is perfect. This film had me reminiscent of slasher horror films of long ago. Michael Myers has always been an icon of evil and often times that representation of pure evil becomes diluted in iconic horror characters. That will not be a problem with this film.
2,Same old story again and again,"You already know the story, a guy kill everybody he meets for no reason.You will have the same guy who is supposed to be dead at the end and oh,,,surprise, he rise again and you should jump on your seat....have you seen this story before ? Yes same old story ... save your money and time and do something else. If you watch this, you'll loose $4 and two hours of your precious time !"
4,Got here quick and no scratchs,Hi.I orderd this and it got here in 2-3 days came quick.Planing to watch it this friday with my best friend.4/5 got here good just what i ordered why 4 out of 5?Havent watched it yet lol.Good buy great price.
3,A dark journey well worth taking,I wonder if John Carpenter had of created his version in the style of Rob Zombie would we all be looking at this movie in a different light?Apart from a few different changes eg It was Annie originally on the bed with the tombstone behind her and Annie did not survive in the original film but putting that aside the film works well. What is it with films of late when the groups of girls all talk at the same time squealing giggling and chatting it is so annoying. The Laurie Strode character is weak in this role. I was also disappointed they cut out the scene where Annie goes to the laundry room and gets locked in.
1,peewwwwwww,"i loved the original halloween. jammie, and donald were wonderful and they could do more for me with the music in the movie than all of the blood and guts of any other movie. so i watched rob zombie remake of a wonderful classic and i have to say it STUNK. i was so dissapointed. were is the imagination that made the old horror movies great. if you follow the movies of the awful rob zombie you will see a pattern of bullcrap and and awful story lines. the acting in the movie was subpar. meaning they could have been better.i think zombie needs to leave the making of movies to the real film directors and go back to what he does best. whatever that is."
2,Remake,"This is a remake of one of, if not thee most succesfull independant films of all time. It's all hype; Rob Zombie is a bad director. I would rate it higher but it's very unoriginal and not scary. This is like a parody of Halloween and it's own cliches. Worth a rental though just to see a little something."
2,Really wanted to like to this film......,"I'm a huge fan of Rob's work both with his music and previous films. I was excited to say the least when I first heard he'd direct a Halloween remake and eagerly awaited the film to hit theatres. I just remember sitting through the movie with my girlfriend being incredibly bored and in awe at how bad this movie was. It just was not scary what so ever. I so wanted to like to the movie, that even half way through I was telling myself it will get better. I was really dissapointed and it really bumped down Rob's skills as a film maker in my book."
2,Disappointed,"I watched this movie based on my impression of the previous two Rob Zombie films. 1000 Corpses and Devil's Rejects were artfully crafted with a tremendous soundtrack to back a solid script and dazzling cinematography. Halloween contains none of these elements. There is literally no point to this movie. It's not scary any more than it is shocking. It's a meaningless blood-bath that I found myself bored while watching. The characters lack depth, the story lacks...a plot...and the imagery is nothing special."
3,Scary!,"I did not like the graphic brutality in this one by Rob Zombie. There was basically no story, just killings. The first one he made there was a story to it and showed why he became a monster, this one has no plot."
2,Worst Horror Remake,"Why Oh Why did Rob Zombie have to go ruin such a classic?To over the top,They kid that played young Michael Meyers looked like a sissy.It relies all on gore and shock value.Rob Zombie should stick to what he knows best and that is music.The only people that might like this are teenagers and college aged kids who have been brain washed buy Hollywood and don't anything about when horror movies used to be good."
5,Writers Today for Tomorrow,"What a treat. A collection of prose and poetry, some by known writers and by some to be known writers, all in a beautifully presented format. This edition should be a companion reader for university classes in creative writing. Such diversity in styles and stories is thrilling and so needed and sought after by writers and readers of the 21st Century. Watch for the completed works by these authors in your bookstores in the near future."
2,Student's opinion of this book,"From a first-time macroeconomic student's point of view, this book sucked. The glossary was very poor making it troublesome to look up unfamiliar terms. Each chapter makes frequent reference to charts and graphs that are located several pages away, causing you to have to shuffle back and forth between pages, trying to decipher difficult new concepts. This book also assumes some prior knowledge of economic concepts, and moves very quickly through progressively more complex material. Thumbs down from a new student's perspective."
4,The desk reference standard!,"Stanton's book is mandatory equipment for any student of US Army Forces in WWII. It is the definitive resource to learn the facts about any unit in the US Army. But like a dictionary, it's not a book that you would, or would even want to - read from cover to cover."
4,Good Resource,"This book is a good resource on the Solanaceae (nightshade) family, despite its age. A must for any serious student of ethnobotany."
3,I feel like scrooge,"I feel like Scrooge for not liking this book. Still Life with Rice was one of the best books I have ever read and It's ""sequel"" did not live up to my high expectations. I would highly recommend Lisa See's, On Gold Mountain If you liked Still Life with Rice."
5,Wow!!,Inspiring! Absolutely inspiring! Nothing else needs to be said about this book and the author. I have become the favorite of all my family and friends since passing along In The Absence of Sun to them.
2,Drier than burnt toast...,"This book was assigned reading for a college class. While there is a lot of valuable information in the book, you'll be hard put to get through it without going into a boredom coma while reading. Every time I started reading a paragraph, I would drift off in my head; The beach, the mountains, medieval torture chamber. Anywhere but in the book. I'm generally a fast and enthusiastic reader but this one took more effort than I could muster to get through it. I gave up and relied on the teacher's interpretation to learn the material."
4,The truth IS out there (you just have to look for it),"Mr. Roberts did an excellent job exposing the darker side of government and US foreign policy since 1942. Unfortunately, there's nothing stopping the powers that be from continueing their assault on America and the Constitution. But with this book, at least they're exposed for who and what they are: a clear and present danger, which, if allowed to go unchecked, will cause even more harm than before. Thanks Mr. Roberts, for shedding light on things that have remained in the dark for far longer than they should."
4,Great Read,"Mr. Roberts does a great job exposing the cover-ups and answewring who was behind some of them. But he left a few unsolved, and just hanging in the air. I guess the answers will be in his next book."
5,Fits Perfectly,"I purchased this in 2009. It was shipped quickly. It fits great and works perfectly. Unfortunately, another one of my original Amana Stovetop coils broke and I'm back to purchase another one. I'm just glad they sell these."
5,WHirpool Stovetop Replacements,The cost of the name brand replacements was twice of what these were. These are exact fit replacements with a great price and no problems.
3,works but...,This Universal Stovetop coil fits my Whirlpool oven and works well - but the coils are noticeably smaller than the originals and not uniformly spaced. Still all-in-all considerably cheaper....
4,Good Value,It was a good buy. I used it on an Estate electric stove and it worked fine. A appliance dealer in my town wanted considerably more for a name brand replacement.
2,burner,"Purchasing was easy and shipping was fast. The item itself is just so, so. Does not set real flat. Pans sort of wobble on it. Gets hot like it should."
3,Poor fit to Drip Pans,The range elements do not fit the drip pans I ordered. The metal tab on the element holder opposite the power plug-ins does not snap-fit into the drip pan. As a consequence the range element does not fit tight or level.
4,works well,It was a perfect fit and works excellent.. If i need any more I will for sure order another one..
2,Poorly made,"The company seems to have put a lot of effort into using hypo-allergenic materials for its earrings, which is admirable. I can't say whether it was successful in that regard, because this pair of earrings was defective upon arrival. The pearl on one of the earrings popped out of the setting as soon as it was touched, and the earring backs fit onto the stocks as clumsily as a pair of $3.99 studs from a cheap store. Certainly not what I expected for $40.If the other pair of earrings I ordered didn't also exhibit poor engineering and craftsmanship, I would have considered it just one of those things and exchanged the pair.I was so happy to find what I thought was a good solution to my nickel-sensitive skin, but alas, my hopeful expectations have been bitterly dashed."
3,"Good, Not Great","Pretty interesting, informative book, but the writing is terrible. The author uses weird phrasing over and over again, and some of the passages just sound strange and jarring to the ear.Get this book for its informative info, not for the actual writing."
1,Ode to Wharton!,"I laughed, I cried, I ???? This harrowing tale of life as a Wharton student profiles how demanding and competitive the addition and subtraction required by accounting and long division (Dear God!!!) required by finance can be for young Wharton students despite their brilliance. How these geniuses of modern finance make it through such a program is beyond me! Their professional and academic feats make physics, medicine, not to mention the lesser liberal arts degrees seem like meer child's play. Thank you, Ms. Ridgway, THANK YOU!!!"
3,Not for fans of the book,"If you're a fan of Tomalin and Hall'sThe Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurstbe aware that this documentary is a different sea tale altogether. Tomalin and Hall's book is a psychological portrait of a small town intellectual desperate for recognition and success. Deep Water, on the other hand, emphasizes Crowhurst's economic plight portraying him more flatteringly as a kind of dreamy anti-hero. Readers of the Tomalin book will like the tidbits of old film footage but may find Crowhurst's tale constrained by the nature of the film medium and the editorial accommodations likely made for family members who are interviewed throughout."
3,narrates only one part of the race,"It should be titled ""The voyage of Donald Crowhurst"". The golden globe race was not a ""disastrous"" race: There was a winner, a poetic character, though men that got beaten by the sea, and Donald Crowhurst, peace to his soul, that got beaten by his own haste. But besides the spoiler, if you are looking for a commentary on the first golden globe race, this is not the right movie. There are, yes, maybe 10 minutes of material from the other sailors, but this movie is mostly telling the story of Crowhurst. The race was definitely more than that. The movie is rather well done, and it will tell you ""something"" about the race, and that's why I gave it three stars. Read ""A voyage for madmen"" by Peter Nichols, and you will have a better figure of what happened."
3,Read the book first,"As an admirer of the book by Tomalin and Hall (read in 1970) I was disappointed that this film completely ignored the true nature of Crowhurst's mental dissolution. One journal alone contained 12,000 words aligning himself with and exploring nearly every religious notion our species has toyed with. His isolation and the nature of his dilemma, in conjunction with his intelligence, apparently forced him to find a ""cosmic"" resolution that might be compared to a much more famous ""forty days and forty nights"" of isolation in a desert. Anyone interested should read the book for the real story and then use the film for backup"
4,Deep Water,"I've read the Strange Last Voyage of Donald Crowhurst about 10 times, and have been waiting for this DVD since I first heard about it some two years ago. If you know the Crowhurst story, get it. If you don't know the Crowhurst saga, get it and get the book.You'll hear Donald speak some, lots of good interviews with his wife and son, some excellent (translated) stuff from the competitor who was winning the race but decided not to, and a lot more. Well done documentary about the first round-the-world race and it's oddest conclusion."
4,Tragically Entertaining,"Circumnavigating the globe ALONE can be invigorating, introspective and crazy-making. The well-intended Donald Crowhurst sets sail in Deep Water which quickly becomes his own dance with the devil.In this well-produced, often sad character study you'll likely enjoy where man's one-on-one with nature can produce some powerful dilemmas."
5,Heroes often fail...,"A moving story which drives homes the peril of the open seas - both physically, and mentally. What started out as a boastful dream turns towards tragedy with an inevitable, sorrowful ending. And who is able to point a finger in reproach unless he has walked in another man's shoes - or in this case, sailed another man's journey? Who among us, under these gravest of circumstances, would have fared better than Mr. Crowhurst? This film will give you food for thought as you contemplate what you would have done had you been this brave sailor. The fact that a man fails does not make his struggle less brave or less noteworthy."
5,Something nearly great..,"and fun! Didn't really know what to expect upon first listen but what I got was fun. This CD makes you want to move in and outside. All the tracks are unique and fun and keepign with the Kristine we all have come to know and love while moving in a new direction. From the funky ""Fly Again"" to the fabolous ""I'll be Your Light"" (which has to be my fave track if I had to choose one) to the inspirational ""Big Big Band"" there is nothing that should be missed or skipped over. As she says ""Faith is the word I heard"""
1,Fly Again - more of the same old dance,"It does all blend together after two minutes into the song - the cd version is better than the mixes - it's the same old mixers, which is a shame for KRISTINE - she's a great vocalist - but her vocals are all lost in the massively over-produced TOMMY BOY crap included on this single.save your money - buy somthing from AMBER - at least she's not using the same people all the time to produce the same dance dance dance rubbish!"
2,Inconsistent,"Whatever happend to Kristine W? Her first effort, Land of the Living was fantastic. It set a new standard and a new sound for dance. Her second effort, Stronger was a step back toward senseless lyrics and typical sounds. Maybe it is that she is writing her own lyrics? She stripped off her heavy make up along with her unique sound for this one. The recording production values on Stronger were that the sound quality was that of hearing it through several layers of cheese cloth. Fly Again is in keeping with Stronger. More senseless lyrics with typical sounds. Don't get me wrong, some of the songs are great. Several will be major dance hits. The stinkers are plenty here also. Broken, is just that broken. What where they thinking with this one? Overall it falls short. Especially to the Kristine W we first met on the Land of the Living. Kristine W would do best to stick with the heavy make up and the bubble dresses and the unique sound that made her a stand out on her freshman effort."
4,Very good,"This is an excellent compilation of catchy dance beats with an fusion of an 80's and house sound. Kristine Weitz has a fantastic voice, has written her own music, which translates to moving lyrics with depth and dance music with soul. I was first impressed with Kristine W. when I saw her perform 'Stronger' on stage a few years ago, but did not think of her as more than a club diva/flash in the pan. This album has changed that point of view completely. It has two CDs, the first composed of 12 excellent tracks, with stand outs like 'Broken', 'Living out Loud' (perhaps the best song on the CD) and the current club hit 'Fly Again'. The second CD is an a fantastic deal, with dance remixes from some of the hottest DJs out there today. You can't go wrong with this compilation. This is probably the best dance album I've heard since Kylie Minogue's 'Fever', and having listened to both discs, I hope to see and hear a lot more of Kristine W. over the next few years."
4,Inspirational album of Life.,"This may or may not be the best work from Kristine W because she had been going through so much with her leukemia (read the liner notes, people). I can only imagine what she was feeling since my mother recovered from stage 4 lymphoma. Everyone should only be amazed that she had the strength to even think about making an album and demonstrate to people her soulful and powerful voice. A friend once told me that he thought she ""was the whitest black woman he had ever heard sing like that."" Her thoughts and experiences are weaved throughout the lyrics of her songs and are spiritually inspirational to anyone.Anyway, this album is great but is below the quality and force as ""Land of the Living"" which I would consider to be her best work. The bonus remixes by Chris Cox from Thunderpuss are just extraordinary; ""I'll Be Your Light"" is my favorite mix.This is a good CD and most people will be pleased with it."
3,Good starter book or for the traveler,"This is a good starter book, excellent for travelling and getting around in Portugal. The audio lessons are pretty well done, but there is not a clear definition of what is brazilian vs continental portuguese pronunciation. My wife successfully used this book as the text for an introductory Portuguese class"
1,ok but not what I ordered,"The quality and size meets all expectations. I received the wrong flag, I did not get the one I wanted, which is the one with the helmet on the flag and the one you asked me to write a review on. If I had received the flag I wanted and ordered I would be giving this 5 stars. I was sent the other Seahawk flag that we didn't care for. I've not received any explanation for this at all."
1,DON'T BUY! SCRATCHES YOUR IPOD!! DIFFICULT TO USE!!,"Horrible. Don't buy it. After slipping it on and off my ipod 3 or 4 times, it totally scratched it up. It creates vertical lines on the front and back of the ipod.It is also very difficult to use. Almost impossible to switch the ""HOLD"" button on. And every time you try, the ipod will slip out of the case.You're better off with one of those iPod nano Tubes."
2,Just fair renditions,"Best on CD is "" If It Ain't One Thing, It's Another."" By Richard 'Dimples'Fields, off his own Album which I had and lost. Love to replace if anyone could help."
5,"SHE'S GOT PAPERS ON ME: RICHARD ""DIMPLES"" FIELD - EXCELLENT","i'm a great music lover and my best on this cd is ""she's got paper's on me"" by richard ""dimples"" field which i've been looking for, for about a year now. the rest are just as good. anyone with info on where i can find the richard fields or lowrider oldies vol. 7 please contact me. pleaseeeeeeee."
5,Transformer Review,"I bought this item because my outdoor Rain Bird sprinkler timer was making a loud buzzing noise. It is 10 years old, and I had read that the transformers start to go out after a few years. This fixed my problem. It is now quiet and powers the timer perfectly. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a similar problem."
5,A must-have for civil cases!,"This was my husband's ""Bible"" for a recent wrongful death case. Extremely helpful and instructional; worth every penny we paid for it."
3,Expected more for Felicity's story,"When I read of Felicity's character in another book, I couldn't wait to read her story. However, it just totally fell short for me. There was too much arguing, bickering, and lying by the heroine in the first 2/3s of this book. I found myself struggling to like her and couldn't really see how she and Miles could be in love with so much distrust and fighting between them. I respected her love for her child but that was it. Although there was a lot of sexual innuendo, I didn't feel the love or the chemistry. I knew the H/H wanted to have sex with each other, but that was about as far as the sensuality went in my eyes. I struggled to see how she could be friends with the other ladies in the story too - she was so often smarting off to them...hmmm, just didn't work out for my tastes."
2,Caution! Does not do photos in HD,"After months of trying various combinations of settings, and having email exchanges with D-Link Technical Support, they finally admitted that the DSM-520 does NOT do photos in HD. It downsizes them to DVD quality. My 1600 x 1200 photos do not look great on our big screen HD TV - a big disappointment."
1,something odd about the toner shipped,"The toner shipped was an Q6511XC. I cannot even find that cartridge with HP at their website. The cartridge leaks at both sides when I attempt to print a page.The good news is they are taking it back, so hopefully this will be resolved."
2,Limited Range,Not bad series for kids. Jock Mahoney is athletic but riding and jumping carry an actor only so far. Every episode seems to be a variation on a single plot.
5,"A Brilliant, Inventive, and Engaging Work of Musical Art","This is one incredible CD, a collection of witty and engaging tunes, like nothing I've ever really heard before. It could be the soundtrack of a fabulous, as-yet-unmade film, perhaps a cross between a Hitchcock thriller, a French farce, and an unexpectedly tender love story. One song sounds like a chase through the Casbah, and the next a semi-cynical confession of indiscretion, told over drinks in a little cafe on the Left Bank. Throw in a bluesy number for an aging chanteuse, then perhaps a little bluegrass, and then maybe something a nostalgic Russian might dance to, after a round of chilled vodka and caviar. For all its world-wide, cosmopolitan flavor, the CD is focused, fun, and brilliantly performed. It's wonderful. I can't wait to see the movie!"
2,Astor in Paris,"Amazon sent me a second copy by mistake, billed me for it, and sent me someone elses' order by mistake too, just for good measure. I have been trying to reach Amazon customer service for almost a month now, by email and by phone to straighten this out. To date I have absolutely zero response from anyone - not so much as a smoke signal. If anyone has any suggestions on how to get a non-computerized response from Amazon, please help me. When their shipping works well, it works really well, but when it doesn't work out, you seem to be on your own.The product was fine, a gift for someone else.Amazon's customer service seems to leave a lot, make that a whole lot of room for improvement. Responding would be a good place for them to start.Astor in Paris"
2,Good leadership content but too political.,"Bennis' book contains some very thought-provoking and certainly actionable suggestions for leadership improvement. However, I found myself constantly disgusted at the overt biased and smug political commentary woven throughout the book. I paid the purchase price to be educated, not editorialized. Caveat Emptor."
1,Slanted and flawed writing on many bad leaders,"Having studied ""Organizational Behavior"" (remember T-Groups?) back in the hippie days, and never having read this ""gem"", I thought after many years it would be inspiring.Warren Bennis actually doesn't even consider Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, thinks of Reagan and Bush senior as somehow not up there (actually has no objectivity at all politically), doesn't consider Hillary Clinton really worth mentioning, and holds as idols Roger Smith (yes, the GM ""Roger and Me"" guy), John Scully (who almost torpedoed Apple), and other very mixed names.The problem with leadership may be that we only have anecdotal and poorly researched material like this available at a popular level.Please consider real information, like ""Human Side of Enterprise"", ""Small Groups"" by Hare et al, works by Maslow and Argyris, and the various modern articles on ""Wisdom"" before wasting time on this book."
4,A must for leaders,"Few, if any capture the essence of leadership in todays confusing companies because of the mixed signals. Mr.Bennis has captured the essence of leadership that is timeless."
5,Brilliant Book,"Warren Bennis is truely a leader and a mentor of leaders. What Warren has to say about leadership should be taught to us first in grade school, and then over and over and over again for the rest of our lives. What Warren has to say is excitingly simple, yet mostly lacking in our current line-up of World Goverment and Corporate leaders."
1,bored out of my mind,"The table of contents has all the main points. The rest is just filler. The stories add little value. Bennis does make a good point that traveling and immersing yourself in foreign cultures is good for personal development as it causes you to reexamine your behaviors.Read ""Leading at the Edge"" instead by Dennis Perkins. Much more entertaining with informative examples. Less common sense preaching."
2,Fair,"The add said the item would ship within 2 days. I did not even receive notice that it had shipped until 4 days after the purchase was made.Due to time contraints I had to go out and buy the book elsewhere, after waiting nearly 2 weeks."
5,One of the BEST Masqaurade Books yet ...,I had to trace this book by the ISBN number since the title is very very common .. and .. as expected it's out of print .....Not knowing when ir if this will go into print again this is a very masterful story of Harriet and her predatory subjugation of Richard the son of a wealthy landowner. Being his governess she embarks on a plan to completely place this young man under her complete power by playing not only with his mind but his body as well. I guess if it happened today it would have her thrown in jail as child abuse but ... Richard wasn't complaining ....Fabulous story well written and highly erotic.. a MUST HAVE for your erotic library if you can find it!
5,Awesome Piece for the Price!,This was the hit of the Christmas gifts this year. My wife loved it. It's nice to see options beyond the run-of-the-mill jewelry manufacturing.
4,more than just a room,"Zoe is determined not to be like her mother. So she sets out on her own and rents a room in an attempt to get away from the things that drag her down...then she becomes that which she despises.This happens so often in families. Kids are always saying ""I'm not going to be anything like my parents."" Yet, that's what they know, so that's what they become. And most don't even know it.The real beauty of this story is that Zoe sees what she's become, acknowledges it, then takes steps to change. She's heading into the unknown, and has no idea whether she'll be okay. But she takes comfort in knowing that this is the right direction.Such a stunning and courageous message to send to kids. Well done, Ms. Pearson."
5,A Perfect Novel,"This is a gripping novel about a high school girl who leaves her alcoholic mother and rents her own room. I loved everything about it.The main character, Zoe, is so well drawn she seems almost real. She has flaws, but she has a big heart and a lot of drive. I really wanted her to make it on her own, and found it difficult to put down the book until I got to the end and discovered her fate.The language is gorgeous, but it's not one of those beautiful books where nothing happens. A lot happens, with page-turning suspense througout the novel.I also liked reading about the vivid supporting characters-- the mean yet realistic grandmother, people at Zoe's school, the creepy guy who Zoe sees at work.This is my favorite teen novel of 2005."
3,never enough,"i feel terrible only giving this book 3 stars. the main character is one that even i could identify with and who seriously broke my heart. her thought processes are lyrical and yet familiar. as zoe (z-o-eeeeeee) slowly falls apart under the pressure of making it on her own, she continues to make more mistakes adding to the pressure. v realistic.the characters in the book are also vivid and wonderfully written, however, there isn't nearly enough of them.this book is almost entirely internal for zoe. her land lady opal had the potential to be one of the best supporting characters i have ever read and she didn't even come in until half way thru the book.the overbearing grandmother who is just evil enough for me to really hate, only came in a few times. this book had the potential to be the book of the year, but IMHO, just wasn't long enough...or something."
3,review of miracles boys,I thought that this was a good book. Although I wasn't really interested throughout the whole book it did have it's involving parts that I could really get into. I would recomend this book to someone who likes stories about families who are struggling to bring eachother together.
3,THE BOOK BANDIT,"I must say this book didnt particularly catch my intrest at first, but after reading the description o the back, i thought it would be cool. Boy was i wrong. This book had a good story but was very slow! I mean theres barely any action and good teen drama in it!So to sum it up.... This book was a little less than OK.sincerelyTHE BOOK BANDITp.s yes i DID see the special for this book on THE-N and i thought it was ALOT better than the book (suprisingly)."
1,This book,You really need to read this book I'm reading it is school and my class loves it. All teachers need to let there kids read this.
1,Wrong Information!,"The story line is superb, however the facts of the mothers death from insulin shock is wrong information! The book says she died of insulin shock. Insulin shock is when one is hypoglycemic or has low blood sugar (or in the instance of a diabetic-too much insulin). The book says she died of not having enough insulin. I cringe when I read this kind of wrong information about diabetes. The book should have said she died of hyperglycemia or high blood sugars or diabetic coma-NOT insulin shock. Once again insulin shock is too much insulin."
3,Miracle's Boys is the book I read,"If you don't like stories that deal with a hard life. Then you probably won't like this story. Its about three boys named Ty'ree, Charlie, and Lafayette, they lost their father when they were really young and then Charlie the second oldest boy got put away for three years in a correctional center for robbing a candy store, he was 12 years old. After third month that he was gone their mother died and Charlie blamed it on Lafayette. When the three years was up, Charlie was a new person and he got into a big problem with some gang members and got arrested and he ended up coming home as the same Charlie that left when he was 12years old."
2,Boring,"As a previous student who read this book, it has remained at the bottom of my list for very good reason. With limited plot, mediocre characters, and just an overall bland setting it brings very little to draw in the attention of young adult readers."
3,Survivable.......Sorta,"I gave Miracles Boys three stars because it wasn't totally horrible. If you have read some of the previous comments, you know this is a really depressing book that deals with one character emotionally maturing. This is not the book for you if you are looking for action. Even though there are a lot of things going on in the book with Lafayette (main character) and his brothers, Charlie and Ty'ree, its not very action packed. This book is really dramatic as well. Usually I don't prefer books with too much drama, but it makes this book a better read. A thing I liked about this book was how Lafayette would flashback and let you put the whole story together by yourself. A thing I didn't like was that it was very short and you don't have time to get used to all the characters. Overall, Miracles Boys was a good book to take advantage of and if you have the time you should read it."
4,weeding the garden near the dwelling of the guardian,"Julian Young presents a sympathetic but not uncritical summary of Heidegger's later philosophy. Heidegger's, often maligned, late mystical or unintelligible musings are granted much benefit of the doubt. The book is surprisingly small and clear, given the number of articles and thoughts Heidegger produced long after his mid-maturity turning away. Among the major topics addressed are: metaphysics, technology, ecology, dwelling, and the guardian. Young grants little context beyond the philosphical, at which he is adept, and provides few psychological insights concerning the changes and development of Heidegger's thoughts. (I suppose it is unfair to clamor for a synthetic appraisal Heidegger's politics and philosophical development from a book seeking to be a handy overview of thoughts not of a life.) This book resembles a map of Sicily that mentions and stars all of the attractions except for the fiery pit of Etna."
2,Pretty Basic,"I really looked forward to reading this book, as I have been thinking of buying Final Cut Studio and a MAC to run it. (not cheap in Africa I can tell you) I was dissapointed ... all these 5 star reviews led me to expect more, instead, I found a book that is just plain average. Example ... In Adobe Premier & Avid Liquid I use the ripple tool quite a lot, this book does not cover it in useable detail, I had to borrow some time on a FCP suite to find out for myself. The book contains a lot of ""history"" about ""how you would have done something 20 years ago"" ... who cares!!!? I certainly don't ever want to see a half inch Lo-band umatic machine for the rest of my life. The colour illustrations are great but the detail and user tips are lacking, making it pretty ... but basic."
4,Great Production.,"Go out and buy this album. The group kinda reminds you of bone thugs. Great production by goldiiz. Mack 10, Mc Eiht, B.G., and Juvenile are featured."
1,Poor choice.,"I've had this battery a total of 5 weeks now. It will no longer charge past 23%, which means it's pretty much useless to me after only 5 weeks!! It supposedly has a 1 year warranty so I'm going to try and see if I can get a replacement."
4,Pretty Good and holds up well,"I bought a pair of these in white to replace 6 1/2 in speakers that were located in the rear of my boat. I drive them with a 4 channel 320 watt marine amplifier with a pair of Clarion 3 1/2 inch speakers up front at the helm. Rounding things off are two 10 inch subs on a second dedicated marine amplifier. When all is tuned up, the system ROCKS!These speakers definitely hold their own and compliment my set up nicely. The mid range sound is loud, crisp and clear with no discernible distortion. Highs are not as crisp as I would like but with the combination I have they are a perfect fit. I am so impressed with their sound quality, that I am considering mounting a pair inside my cuddy cabin.Finally, the quality is definitely on par with some of the more expensive brands and I can say that mine get wet quite a bit when I wash the boat down and still perform well after 8 months of use. A nice looking quality product at a fair price is what you get with these speakers.Enjoy!"
2,Honey I copied the SAP manuals,Well that was my feeling after I browsed through it - if you are an SAP user then you must be investing a good part of your time using SAP - then you must have a live SAP system and some users manual. Then why do you need this book.Most of the things taught in this book are also in windows for dummies.due to the nature of SAP - before you use the software you must know a little bit of the architecture and unless you know that screen shots will not help you. If you need to know details please go to help.sap.com or sap service market place but please do not waste your money on this book.I guess he is a teacher who wants to make his students buy this book - well then he is succesful
4,Got what I wanted,"Good net for a good price, yep catches fish. Don't know how durable it is, haven't used it long enough to tell."
1,Boring,This book was a tough read.. and I only went through a few chapters before I was bored and too much went over my head.. I don't recommend.
3,IPOD only??,"As far as I know(I experienced), 'The Audio' service does not work on Kindle fire and Kindle for Android. Therefore, I had to refund it. Did I have to activate something or else?"
2,PRICE RAISE!!!,I was pleased to be able to keep these on hand for baking and other cooking purposes so I subscribed to them monthly. I am aware that the cost of food items has gone up recently but I was shocked to see that they had gone from 26.00 the first month to 53.00 the second month. Needless to say I stopped my subscription after they were sent automatically (per my request of course) but I did not notice the price raise until after I had received them. Product is fair but way way to pricey now for the results.
3,The shoes are small/short for size,Was surprised to find these shoes rather small. Cannot use socks with them as they are short and narrow also.
5,Reebok Princess Sneakers,"The best sneaker made in my opiniom, have been wearing them for years, they are classic, wear well and last."
1,Reebok Woman's Princess Aerobics Shoe has dropped in size and quality,"I own a pr. of these that I purchased a few years ago. I wear them nearly every day . The new pr. are the same color and are labeled the same size. They run small, hence, do not fit. The innersole is stiff and has no built in arch support. My original pr. has a cushiony innersole with a built in arch support. Even the shoe itself seemed to be made of a slightly different material. It was a very big disappointment for me."
2,Reebok Tennis Shoes,I purchased these Reebok tennis shoes for my Sister for Christmas. She has worn Reebok's forever and has always worn a size 9. However for some reason these tennis shoes were like a size smaller. Felt more like a size 8 then a size 9.So we had to return them. Of course I was disappointed knowing how much she wanted these tennis shoes.
4,"nice fit, comfortable","have used these for years, just do not dry them in a clothes dryer. really good quality I have came to expect from Reebok."
1,Bad quality,"I've bought several pairs of these shoes over the years, but I'll never buy them again. They're not leather anymore, and, worse yet, they aren't even remotely the same size they used to be. I just received a pair with one shoe much smaller than the other. Time to return these and find a new brand of shoes."
4,love the shoe,The shoe was a good choice for me..they fit great..so I had to order some tennis shoes and they were just the one's I wanted..thank you so much.. had to have it!!
5,Good replacement of the same,"I previously had this same shoe and it serves the purpose well. They are stable and serviceable. I'd worn out the previous same shoe. Rebok works well for me, and as always Amazon prices are fair."
1,man-made uppers,This is not the original leather princess. Amazon was good about acknowledging it was not as advertised and issuing a refund. I can't believe Reebok switched to these piece of junk sneakers - they'd be great if you like sweaty feet!
4,simple and comfortable,"I bought these sneakers for my mother and another pair for a friend of hers. They claim this model is more comfortable, because it doesn't have all the stitches/layers on top of the toes. It's more comfortable especially for people with arthritis on the toes."
5,great shoes,I have been wearing the Princess sneaker for years now and have them in white also....They are the only shoe I can put on new and never have a problem with them. true to size and width. I have back problems and these are the only shoes I can wear and walk comfortably...Great product......
3,Ain't What It Used To Be,"I used to wear Reebok Princess shoes a few years ago and I remember them being very soft and comfy and never needed a ""breaking in"". The new pair is stiff and not so comfy. I hope they will eventually get ""broken in""."
4,Shoes,I got this product in really good time but I just didnt know they were so narrow but it will work for what I bought them for.
