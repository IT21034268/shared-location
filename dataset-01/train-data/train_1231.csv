4,Pleasantly Satisfied,"When I bought the book I was on a book buying frenzy. When I finally got around to reading it I had wondered why I had ordered it. I guess my preference choices had changed since the purchase date. Since I love to read and it was next up, I thought I would give it a try and I am so glad I did. What a wonderfully entertaining book. The main character was likeable, funny and real. Uncle Benny was lovable and his life, loves and losses left me with a heavy heart and tears. Each character was brought to life as if I knew them personally. The laughter, smiles and tears left me glad I gave this wonderful book a try."
5,loved this machine,"This product was great, my family and i will use this time and time again. After a couple simple adjustments it worked fine. I had to raise the end away from the motor as it kept walking out of the gear, and the pie pans used to stop heat from getting to motor and gears....other than those,it work great.........I am really looking forward to using it again."
5,Sweet rotisserizer,"Good rotisserie. Seems to work fine. I also got some brackets to mount it to my charcoal grill, which was pretty easy since the slot on the motor housing is three inches wide (that seems to be the pretty much universal size). The spit rod could be a little thicker, but I put two, five pound, chickens on it, and it didn't bend or break or put excess strain on the motor. I bought a couple extra spit forks to do more than one thing at a time. All in all I am very pleased."
2,Grizzly Spit Rotisserie,I checked the batteries before inserting into the motor. The the gauge read full charge. The motor had a hard time rotating the 2 whole chickens on the spit. After 5 minutes the rotisserie stopped turning and I had to discontinue cooking the chickens. I can't tell if you need fresh batteries but it didn't work for me.
4,Grizzly spit,"Happy with product . Simple to use does what is suppose to .Neg, a little loud. I would not mind spending a little more money for a better quality product."
4,Cool,"With ""Happyness"", their fifth release, the Aluminum Group refines the lush cocktail pop they introduced on Plano. John and Frank Navin, the Chicago-based architects of this sound, augment their Brasil 66-Burt Bacharach style by dropping in faddish elements such as the light drums'n'bass skiffle of ""Tiny Kisses"", the trance harmonies on the elegant drone ""We're Both Hiding"", and subtle touches of electroclash - mostly percussion -on any number of tracks. The surface of these songs are smooth, the vocals - and vocal harmonies - deadpan. Yet there are (barely hinted at) tensions underneath, the isolating detritus of modern love. There are times when the Aluminum Group sound like nothing more than a postmodern version of The Association. More often, they invoke the chill out room at the hippest club in the coolest city in the world."
1,Little or no equation,"An interesting collection of short related stories, but scarcely a mention of the actual equation, which is really trivial, or its development. Pity - a lost opportunity.A future edition could usefully include a few math appendices so the average scientist can see what all the fuss is about."
4,Could'nt put it down,"The continuation of the Hideaway Legacy was as good a read as Just before dawn, however not as steamy....the characters, Gabriel which vowed to never get caught by cupids arrow, did just that with someone you'd never think it would happen with..a teacher, the story line was interesting nevertheless, and I could'nt wait to get to the next chapter; I found myself feeling the reluctance, then excitement, and then happiness, and I thoroughly enjoy how all family and characters from previous books come back to life, and interact in this one... I was a little disappointed that Salem Lassiter did'nt realize with his ability to feel danger where Summer was concerned...but nonetheless, I will continue to purchase and read Ms. Alers books, on this subject matter and keep them for future reads, after all, it does help to be able to live some of these stories in our lives if only for a little while during the trying times of our country and everday life. JKing. Grand Prairie, Tx"
3,Not going out with a bang,"Let me first say I absolutely love Rochelle Alers' books. But the ending of her Hideaway Series was frankly kinda boring. Of course the book's love scenes were well-written because Ms. Alers can't write a bad love scene. But the book had little or no suspense until the last few pages. I was glad to be reunited with all the Coles, Kirklands, Lassiters and Sterlings. But, I cherished the book more because it was the last in the Hideaway series and not because it was a really great romance book. I didn't really fall in love with either Summer and Gabriel, like I did with the other characters in the series. Frankly, the storyline for both characters wasn't very strong. Oh well, I bought the book to complete the series, but honestly if it were not part of the series I wouldn't necessarily recommend it."
5,Excellent,I thought this book was excellent. This is my first time reading a booke by Rochelle Alers. I stumbled upon this book by accident and it was absolutely magnificent. I couldn't put it down. I now realize that this was the last in a series. I am going to get the other books in the series ASAP and read them.
1,Big Dissapointment,"I really enjoy Ms. Alers and I've read most of the books in the HIDEAWAY series. This is the worst one. I was very dissapointed. Where was the chemistry between David and Summer? Oh wait...it was there...but it felt forced. There were a few, um, what's a good word?....TASETLESS moments. One was when they were bumping-and-grinding at the high school Halloween dance. And she even had the nerve to drop it like it's hot in front of the students! Lastly, this book was 60% Summer and David; 40% David's family. It's as if Ms. Alers didn't have much of a love story for these two. What's up with that?"
4,Comfy and easy to clean,"I bought these shoes to wear in my pottery studio, where clay gets on everything. They are very comfortable, even while standing on a hard concrete surface for long periods of time. I just throw them in the sink to rinse the clay off - whereas before I had to wear old tennis shoes that never got more than a surface wipe and were always dirty. The only issue I have had with them is that I have a high instep, and the top of my foot tends to stick to the upper of the shoe in one spot when I don't wear socks. Otherwise, they are great."
1,Stiff uppers and sharp vent edges rubbed skin off little toes.,"While the sole is comfortable on hard surfaces, after wearing around town on a few errands, mostly by car, the skin on the tops of my little toes was rubbed off. I also had red patches of skin in other areas on the tops of my feet which would have rubbed off had I continued wearing them. I was limping by the time i got home, and now I can't wear regualr shoes without bandaids until they heal. The uppers are too stiff, and the edges around the vents are sharp. Also, the insides of the little button things that hold the straps hurt the sides of my feet where they rub them. If I hadn't discarded the shoe box I would have returned them. Now they just take up space in my closet. Perhaps with socks they'd be OK, but that would defeat the purpose of sandals/clogs. I'm sorry I wasted my money. The irony is that I bought these specifically for comfort - not style."
5,Good scary film,I liked this movie. And I'm not usually a fan of this type of movie. The scene where the priest is seducing the nun is incredible and the frightening scenes will grab you when you leaast expect it.
4,Light and Dark,"This movie is about two virgins getting pregnant, one with God's child and the other with the Devil's. Great story line and plot. It keeps you guessing who is pregnant with what child and the ending is great."
4,"Simple, affordable, Soud Card","I bought this external sound card because my internal one on my MacBook broke. Being a sound designer for theater, I have used many sound cards, and this one was a good option for the price range I was looking for. While you can get a more expensive sound card, and it will sound better, this one is great for the price listed on Amazon. If you're looking for a surround sound card do not buy this one, at least if you own a Mac. There are no drivers available. However, if you are looking for a simple affordable sound card, this is a great option! I would recommend it to many of my friends!"
1,Do not waste your money,This USB sound card is very fragile and will not hold up. You can get better USB sound cards for less money. You pay for the name and not the quality.
4,Zalman ZM-RSSC External USB 5.1 Sound Card,The Zalman ZM-RSSC External USB 5.1 Sound Card works very well. I have it set up from a computer USB to drive a 5.1 speaker system. It is small and does the job splendidly.
4,good book,this book was in great condition but it ended up being the 6th edition and i didnt realize i needed the 3rd edition...
4,very nice,"This book is in great condition, it arrived on time, and was WAY cheaper than the campus book store."
3,It's Ok.,"I had higher hopes for this after loving both Batman: Long Halloween and Batman: Dark Victory, but it seems that Jeph is better suited at writing Batman stories. The art was good for this, but the story just felt middling. Maybe I just don't find Selina Kyle/Catwoman as interesting as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Also, the whole point of this was supposed to be pursuing the mystery of Catwoman's origin, and it felt like that part of the story failed. They spend 6 issues telling us only a little more than what what hinted at in Dark Victory."
5,Loeb & Sale do it again!,"Jeph Loeb is, in my opinion, the best writer in comics these days. I have thoroughly enjoyed everything that he has written, and Catwoman: When in Rome is no exception! This story works well as a sequel to Batman: The Long Halloween, also by Loeb and Sale. It's always fun to see more character development from these two, Sale's artistic style flawlessly conveying Loeb's story and adding much to it. The Riddler's role in this book is a lot of fun, showing his cowardice and sinister nature amidst much comic relief. Catwoman is, as always, graceful and sexy, and learning further elements of her past is a good time. Highly Recommended for Catwoman, Batman, Loeb and Sale fans!"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Following The Long Halloween Catwoman sojourns to Italy, and becomes entangled with the Falcone crime family.She tries a jewel heist from the Vatican, and ends up getting into quite a bit of trouble, from many sides, and the whole Gotham City thing isn't reall that far away after all."
2,"Fairly Good Story, Dissapointing Art","Okay, to begin with, I believe I have been spoiled by the Catwoman Vol. 2 Comic series. In this comic, Catwoman is designed as she was in the 80's: Curled Ears, Whiskers, What appears to be Synthetic Fiber and....a tail. Now, I bought another graphic novel in 1992 that had Ctawoman depicted in this style, but one was enough. The artwork is very dark and unfocused, and a little haphazard.The story is pretty good, but not nearly as good as most other Catwoman stories.Also, it is extremely short, and the only really good part of the book is the front cover. Aside from that, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Ok...Just Ok,"This book is ok and would otherwise be horrible if it wasn't for the ever beautiful artwork of Tim Sale thus making all my reviews of his books to have a minimum rating of three stars if the story is horrible like this one. Selina whose secretly Catwoman is a moody lady (very realistic) and quite dreamy. There is a reason for this as she battles her moods and dreams to uncover the truth of her past, specifically the identity of her parents. However, this is not a Catwoman origin story as some people say since it does not explain how or why she became Catwoman. Selina is pretty sexy in this book, but it does not really make up for poor story or lack of real villains in this story."
3,"Easy, like Sunday morning","It would make a good movie or a better book of short stories. Easy, pleasant reading, nonetheless."
3,"It's bad at worst, above average at best, mediocre overall.","This 'Essential' really doesn't have any exciting material, really. It's all just pointless, meandering filler. The characterization is nonexistent and the plots are very run of the mill. It's only worth seeing and reading as a sort of time capsule. It's not very good, but it's one example of how comics were like in the sixties."
3,All too human,"This is a strange play. The political satire is timeless. However, I did not read it for enjoyment. I read it to help me to understand it a little more before I saw it adapted in a German theater is Saarbruchen. The little acting company was excellent and I enjoyed the play in its updated version."
4,Good to know.,"The book is easy to read and provides great insight in an objective manner into the nature of equity prices. The writer has exceptional experience and also provides some of the intricate details concerning how markets may be influences by forces that are not very aware to the average person.I would recommend that you add this book to your library, as it does fulfill an intellectual gap not provided by other books in the industry."
3,First 100 pages,"OK, so i'm not done with the book yet, but I'm already irked that i read the first 100 pages when it could easily have been condensed into twenty or thirty pages. Soo boring... Get to the meat already!"
2,beating the average,"While I must admit that there is valuable insightin here for the average individual who thinks thathe may get rich quick, the basic premise of thebook is truly unremarkable. It boils down to: onaverage, you can't beat the average, so buy indexfunds."
4,Best alternative if you can't follow value investing,"The book has provided the best alternative if you can't follow value investing. It indicated that security market is semi-strong and you cannot beat it easily. However, if you think that you are smart as Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett or Philip Fisher, go ahead and pick stock by yourself.I give it four star is because it does not provide the risk on buying index fund in dollar-cost averaging method. For example, Nikkei 225 falling from 80,000 to 12,000 from 1990 to 2000. Can anyone take profit during this 10 years?I suggest to read the book as personal financial planning category instead of investing."
5,Great Buy - Very Dry,"Great buy! I purchased it for a diving trip in Cozumel and it didn't disappoint. There was rough water and large waves that would have killed a regular snorkel but I did not swallow water once! The valve shut off as expected any time the water got near it. It is much less bulky than true dry snorkels and, at least from my experience, just as ""dry"". I am very happy with it and recommend to everyone."
2,Almost 3 stars!,"Molly Hatchet are often put in the same category as Lynyrd Skynyrd, although Molly Hatchet have a much heavier musical approach. I dare to say that Lynyrd Skynyrd is a more talented band, but the guys in Molly Hatchet surly shine from time to time. The memorable tunes on this album are the opening hard and groovy ""What does it matter?"" and the southern semi ballad ""Fall of the peacemakers"", which is Molly Hatchet's ""Free bird"" (Lynyrd Skynyrd) or ""Highway song"" (Blackfoot). This is a decent album in the line of southern boogie rock, close to 3 stars!"
1,ummmmmmmmmmmmm,So I was looking for some Molly online and it struck me - does anyone else wonder how Amazon can calim that you save almost $9.00 per SONG? WTF?
1,This is NOT a remaster,I'm not sure what's wrong but the waveforms on this disc are virtually identical to the 1983 disc. Nowhere on the disc do you find any reference to 'remaster' or '1995' (the year it supposedly came out). Sounds like Amazon made a mistake of some kind.
2,the return of danny joe brown,danny joe brown returns to the band but it realy could not save this lp.the only cool song on the album is the classic fall of the peacemaker.a cool jammin rock tune.the band lost so much magic after flirtin when danny joe left the band
1,what a waste....,"Scope that album cover closely: recognize the second guy from the left? Yes, sadly, that's the ex-drummer for Mother's Finest. What an unmitigated waste of talent. Kind of like Ringo Starr playing with Def Leppard, huh?"
1,Save Your $2,"Do not pay money for this film. It is horrible, and not in a funny entertaining way. It is just gross and stupid. This was made with a home movie camera on a $10 budget with people who I will not even give the honor of being called actors. It is sick and stupid, and I want my money back. My cat has made better movies than this."
2,PRETTY BAD - NOT IN A GOOD WAY,"This is one of those misleading 'movies' that looks better in a trailer than it plays out. The image on the cover is NOT in the movie. It's got some blood and gore and it has a nasty sequence involving a baby (fake of course) but the FX are so awful there is virtually no impact from anything they are trying to do. There IS however a LOT of pathetic over-acting and people screeching at each other through most of the running time and even though I normally have nerves of steel when it comes to no-budget horror, the obnoxiousness of the characters, the countless failed attempts at humor and the horrible camerawork was really just too much for me and I did fast forward some parts just to get past the tedium. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of one is because it has crazy ambition and tries to entertain, however the director's idea of entertainment is something most horror fans will probably find more irritating than anything else."
5,Julio Iglesias: De Nina a Mujer,"Julio's voice is like an instrument. You do not even need to understand Spanish to appreciate his music. This may be his most classic CD from the height of his popularity. ""De Nina a Mujer"" has perhaps the most beautiful lyrics from a Father to his Daughter."
1,Day 1 review .. Costly .. will update later,"Since i paid so much money, i feel i can give you 1 star now and add up stars as effects are seen later.Initial opinion: Looks interestingIngredients: Aqua, Amniotic Fluid, Steareth 2, Stearyl Alcohol, Sodium Lactate, Lactic Acid, Glycerin, Serine, Sorbitol, TEA Lactate, Urea, Sodium Chloride, Lauryl Diethylenediaminoglycine, Lauryl Aminopropylglycine, Allantoin, Alcohol denat, Tocopheryl Acetate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Isopropyl Palmitate, Stearreth 21, Decyl Oleate, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Mthyl paraben, Butylparaben, Ethylparaben, propylparaben, imidazolidinyl urea, BHT, Methylisothiazolinone, Methylcholroisothiazolinone, ParfumWill see if this works with Cosmelan 2 and will update if better results are obtained on my Melasma. Probably in about 2 months"
5,Couldn't be happier.,"The book and the CD look brand new to me, and the shipping was maybe a couple days longer than I had expected; but, I have no complaints, everthing was like advertised."
1,buy from the manufacturer,"Seems there are counterfeit tubs of nuPro being sold. Go to the website and buy direct.This product did not look like nupro, did not smell like nupro and didnt work like nupro. Tossed it."
4,"Worth the money, if your dog likes it.","I bought this supplement for 2 of my dogs. The dog that needs it the most, can't stand the smell or taste. The other dog does not mind it at all. I agree the liver smell is quite strong and not very pleasing but the ingredients are good. I wish both dogs would eat it."
4,"Abandoned ships, hidden treasure, spies and monsters!","This is an obscure but fascinating offering from Francis Van Wyck Mason which was originally published under the psuedonym Geoffrey Coffin. The story unfolds after our intrepid hero, an undercover agent, takes a job as caretaker for an aging fleet of empty ships tied together off the Maryland shore. He encounters a series of dark secrets and unusual characters. Overall, a little dark but fun story."
5,Best served cold!,"Revenge is the kinda show I never imagined I'd like. I'm not a big fan of TV soaps or romance novels, but little by little I got drawn into Emily's web of intrigue and deception. I found it very satisfying watching the bad guys get a taste of their own medicine. And trust me, they deserve it. I may not really like Emily, but I really like what she does and how she does it. Can't wait for the second season."
5,Grear addition to our DVD library from Amazon,"For a camping trim in an area without regular TV available, we wanted something that would fit into potential inclement weather periods. Revenge (the complete 1st season) was the right choice. Commercial free on 5 discs, each disk was about the length of a movie. Turns out this was a great alternative to 5 different movies, and got us psyched up for the second season starting next week. As usual, service from Amazon was timely and accurate."
5,Great First Season,I can't rate this show because I haven't watched it yet. It was recommended to me by many friends that think the show is great. Looking forward to viewing during the long winter months.
4,Very Good,I could not stop watching it once started... It is very exciting and you can not wait to see what is going to happen in the next chapter
3,Revenge,"There was too much killing and it was corny, also. I was disappointed in it. I would not order Season 2."
3,Good start but.....,"This series had a great start. However, this great start has proved to be difficult to keep going. Once the initial episodes had been shown the theme lost impetus, the story line proved untenable to substantiate a long drawn out series. It is difficult to keep enthusiasm going when the story line of revenge becomes diluted with episodes that really bear no relation to the main premiss of this series.On the positive side the actors develop their characters and are the only real reason for continued viewing. The writers have to come up with material that matches the initial episodes in quality or they will undermine the casts ability to hold viewer interest."
5,Revenge: The Complete First Season,"This is probably the best show currently on ABC, and the bonus clips and features are really cool too! Great buy!"
2,Starts good - turns real weak in the final quater.....,"The show started of surprisingly strong in the first few episodes.Of course you have some of the typical ABC E.S.o.B. (empty shells of beauty) actors / cast......., but clearly a positiv standout for the network.Unfortunately around episode 18 it turns into one of the usual boring,childish shows we are supposed to watch nowadays. So I didn`t even finish it!Had the show been made with a smarter, more deliberate plot (perhaps for only one season) at a cable channel (therefore with better actors) it could have been one of the best shows in recent years."
2,"Kostler needs a better ""Boswell""","Koestler was the one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th century, and one of its profoundest writers.Unfortunately, Cesarani is neither great nor profound. He is a narrow-minded, wretched hack who does a politically correct hatchet job on Koestler, besmirching his reputation as the giant that he was. The biographer brings his notorious reputation as a character assassin to his greater subject. He is also a borish scribbler who dangerously considers freedom of speech to be ""a relic of 18th-century liberalism"".Kostler needs a better ""Boswell"" than this petty mouse that would toss into the ashbin 300 years of hard won freedoms. Koestler writings were about those freedoms and the dangers stooges, such as Cesarani and other fellow travelers, muster against those freedoms."
4,Worth the money,"I borrowed this book from the local library today, read the whole book, and now I am here on Amazon to purchase my own copy. I find it interesting that this book has received some mixed reviews. However, my belief is that even if I only get three or four new ideas from this book, it is worth it to me. As a Floridian, I take many trips to Disney. I am always looking for ways to make my stay more enjoyable. This book certainly does that for me."
5,Thank you!,We've been planning a Disney vacation for our family and when I saw this book I couldn't wait to purchase it. I'm so thankful for this book! With all of the charts and tips it does all the work for you. Before I found the book I searched and couldn't find this great information on the internet. With Disney on a dime we will save hundreds of dollars on our trip. Thank you for writing such an excellent book for all of the Disney fans out there!
1,Not what I expected,This book was really basic in offering tips for budget conscious disney travellers. It didn't help me much. A lot of the information I already knew. I was looking for something more and I didn't find it here.
4,Worth the Dime,Used many of these tips to save big money on our trip. Book was written in 2006 so a few updates are needed but overall accurate info.
3,A long drawn out story.,"The story itself is not bad, but interdispersed amidst it is the complete history of Hawaii's originations along with more info about volcanoes than I as an average reader want to know, its about a wealthy family of whom the father a leading Hawaiian politician with 3 legitimate heirs and one illegitimate son who is a lawyer for the local union that want their own representative rather than the wealthy leading dude, there was a movie made from this book starring Charleton Heston which as I recall was worse than the book, the movie has a different story line in that I think Heston plays the politician instead of a psycho drunken son as in the book."
2,Not my favorite version,"If you are looking for a simple version of the rule and do not want someone's opinion of what Benedict is saying then I recomend you get The Rule of St Benedict, editor PlanetMonk Books, translator Boniface Verheyen. I got this book first and it was not what I was wanting. The one by PlanetMonk Books is much better. It is broken up by days and set up so you can skip to the day you are wanting. And it is just Benedict's writing. I am much happier with it."
4,Good Stuff from Canada,"This is good hard rock from 1971. Get this reissue and see if you want to pay the big bucks for an original album.If you are into meaty rockin' lead guitar, it is featured throughout the album, but is the real fun on ""Unchanging World"" and ""Seal a Beam Bow.""It is nearly impossible to understand this record these days. Music meant more in the late '60 and early '70's. It was a whole 'nother world.Ellsion will sound dated, and the ""effects"" are more maddening than enhancing, but try to ear with your ""Sixties Ears,"" and it'll sound fine."
3,"I liked it, but...","This would have been better AS EITHERA 'Rockumentary' OR Concert (LIVE)DVD.But as both, it doesn't really quitelive up to it's anticipated hype among'Trick fans. Sure the set list consistsof mostly '(Un)Special One material - itkicked off the Special One Tour...Rick, Bun E. and Robin's (he said he was 10at the time of the Live at Budokan release!)comments are cool and it's good to see theguys with their families trapesing acrossthe far East, where they are still well loved.But Tom Petersson comes across as shallow, usesbad language (swearing and takeing the lord'sname in vain - @ least in Silver they bleepedhim out!)and tries in around about way to insistHE came up with the name 'Cheap Trick' and thelogo (!), which totally contridicts what RickNielsen just said in a previous clip! Most ofthe material here is acoustic/ or acoustic LIVEin the studio. I was kinda hoping for a LIVE ATBUDOKAN 2003, here. Oh, well, a cheap trick, Iguess, on me. Caveat Emptor!"
1,Won't stamp metal,This product does not have enough force to stamp metal. Maybe it would stamp aluminum foil? We bought the brass tags to stamp and they were too hard. This stamp did not even leave a scratch. We were so disappointed.
1,Terrible,"First problem, stamps didn't fit in the punch tool. After filing down the stamps they fit, but the punch tool didn't have enough 'oomph' to mark aluminum. Going old school and smacking the stamp by itself with a hammer (tough to hold because the pieces are so small) didn't even produce good markings because the raised letters were shallow and uneven."
1,Horrible,"For $7 you get what you pay for; absolutely nothing. At no time does this book describe the notation inside and sporadically jumps from one incomplete, detailless proof to another. This book bearly ranks as a pocket reference. If there was an option for no stars, this book should get it."
5,Heartwarming,"The first book my mother ever checked out for me was ""Whoever Heard of a Fird?"" when I was 3 or 4 years old. That was 14 years ago and I still remember how wonderful it was. It taught me early on that everyone is unique, and although you might not know of anyone that is like you off hand, that no matter what, there is someone that will accept you for you. I'll always remember the story about a poor half-fish, half-bird named Fird and his journey to find others of his kind."
1,A movie to trip to,"This is what happens when you get 10 of your friends together to make a ""weird"" movie. It's badly made and acted, has awful sound and extremely repetitive footage. The only use I could possibly think for it is as background imagery for a party where everyone is off their face on acid. Hey, I took a chance and lost, now you don't have to, m'kay?"
1,First and last book I'll ever read by this author,"I would classify this as the most disappointing book I've read in this category, and my first with this author. It fell short in all categories. It offered little as a police procedural, very little character development, lightweight treatment of the story as a whole. There is even the story of 2 police officers dating that had no relevance at all to the story and didn't even have the decency to come to any reasonable conclusion as a side story. Was it accidentally inserted from another story? It bumbled along to the point near the end where I wondered why I wasted my time, when suddenly the victim is brutally raped and then murdered. The senseless violence was such a jarring incongruity to the rest of the story that it made me truly angry. I look at the credits and past books and would have expected that this author was capable of a great deal more. It's no wonder he doesn't publish it under his real name."
5,ALICE IN TIN PAN ALLEY,"In THE FRUMIOUS BANDERSNATCH, Ed McBain weaves biting satire and police procedural into pure gold. His prime target is the 21st century record business and some of the evils wrought by monopoly of the airwaves, but along the way he manages to skewer other media foibles. (like the panels of ""expert"" talking heads that proliferate on television) The warp of McBain's loom is the good old 87th Precinct. The detectives of the 87th duel an FBI task force to solve a high profile kidnapping. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. There was too much useless dialogue that I think was used just to fill up space on the page. I have enjoyed his previous novels, but not this one. There were two characters that I have yet to figure out what roles they played in this book. I think the author just threw the whole thing together in a timely manner to satisfy his editor."
4,Fiften minutes of fame.,"Musical entrepreneur Barney Loomis discovers Tamar, a gorgeous looking Mexican-Russian girl with the voice of an angel and a body that would stop men in their tracks. He plans a spectacular introduction of her first hit song accompanied by a controversial video of her being mock raped by a black dancer, dressed as a mythical beast, on a luxury motor launch on the river. Three masked figures appear and drag Tamar away to a waiting speed boat in front of a stunned audience. A phone call demanding $250,000 in ransom is made to Loomis's office and so the local police from the 87th precinct and the FBI are called in. The pace is cracking and the dialogue is authentic sounding as plots are laid by the baddies and plans are made for Tamar's rescue by the cops. It's a fast read, using characters that Mr.McBain has introduced before and, even though I've never before seen some of the words used by the author, most readers would enjoy it."
1,Not impressed with the obscenties...,"I used to love to read McBain's early 87th Precinct novels. I hadn't read any in years, so I decided to give this book a try. The language was so disgusting I quit reading this book. Doesn't anyone write a good cop or detective novel any more without using gutter language? We all know it exists, but we don't have to wallow in it. Amazon should have a obscenity rating on all its books."
4,Not a collection for the impatient,"I was reading parts of this book while my Grandmother was dying in the hospital, so you can imagine my state of mind after I reached the end of a paragraph. Actually, sections of this trilogy are howlingly funny, especially Molloy, easily the most accessible of the trio. Malone Dies and The UnNamable both start out coherently, then drift onwardly into a sea sick like eulogy which might drive a reader mad. Stick with it for the language however and let yourself wander along with Beckett even if you find yourself on the brink of collapse. The literary equivalent of being on a raft, lost in the ocean"
4,"Artistic, Abstract, and Modern","I am subtracting one star only because of the weakness of the middle novel, _Malone Dies_. The middle novel serves only to help set up the final novel, _The Unnamable_, which is one of the most intense epic jam journeys in the history of English ficticious literature. _The Unnamable_ is so awesome, so intense, that I almost forget what the first two novels were about. In some ways I don't even care. All I care about is _The Unnamable_. I vaguely remember that _Malloy_ was about some..guy riding around aimlessly on his bicycle; as for _Malone Dies_, I don't remember much at all, exept that it was lackluster. But the third novel more than makes up for all of this. It must be remembered that _The Unnamable_ is an abstract, far-out work of art. It is not exactly a clearly written guide-to-life, or anything like that. It is an epic poem of unbelievable profundity, an enjoyable and invigorating journey into the farthest depths of abstract madness."
3,A Throughly Modern Novel,"The Everyman's Library is a wonderful edition and does Beckett and the modern novel justice as an artist and a art formIn Molloy you will read over a 100 pages with no paragraphs. There is little in the way of plot, characters, dialog,etc. If you want to ""read"" a modern novel, here it is. Kind of like atonal music. Intellectually you know you are supposed to beimpressed,but it is very hard to ""get it"".Malone is somewhat easier to read with two characters and paragraphs but that is as about far as Beckett will go in accomodating his readers. Nobody does much,or goes anywhere.I can be as patient as the next reader. After all I actually read War and and even Joyce's Ulysses.This was my third shot at Beckett's Big Three. But finally I gave up again. I guess thisstuff is just over my head."
2,I tried really hard to like this...,"I though i was a big fan of postmodernism until I was told that this is one of the essential texts of the movement. I enjoyed Waiting for Godot, but found this book to be completely unbearable. I couldnt even get through the first of the three short novels in it. There is no plot whatsoever, which is, of course, the point, but it doesnt make for an enjoyable read."
5,Works With Cingular 8525,I have only had it for a few days but it works great with my Cingular 8525. Listening to musics is great. Beeps when I get a phone call. Works just like it said. No problems pairing the headphones to the phone.
3,Solved problems book,"Originally the book of Richard Bronson(1982) was very useful for the solution of simple problems, then a difficult one, but it is always required a text book accompany this. The students of my classes need all the time solved problems to practice."
3,not enough,"First of all, be careful, this is not a text book. It has a good presentation for problem solution. First, there are a some solved problems, then supplementary problems are coming. The answers of supplementary problems are at the end of the book.This book might be useful for beginners. For every topic, there are easy problems, not specific problems similar to case studies. If you are over beginner degree, this book will not be useful for you. Especially, integer programming sections are not satisfactory. For instance, there isn't any facility location problem solution.To sum-up this book may be useful for a beginner as a workbook."
3,Study guide,"I purchased this book for school, it was a decent read, great for gathering some highlights and topic awareness gathering purposes."
4,a good book,i am an eng. doctor in engineering college university of anbar - iraq and i see this book is a good in prepare my lectures in water resources economy and planning
2,Boring is righ,"The game runs and plays fine, but, as reviewed by so many, I just lost interest in it. Talk to guy, open chest, find key, open door, talk to guy, etc. Boring."
2,Inventory bug ruins the game.,"The inventory bug is unresolved, especially for Windows 7. Makes the game unplayable past the 2nd level. Game is enjoyable except can't use inventory system. Weak programming. Tried all the tips and fixes from the internet sites for BD - no help.Good luck with this one - if you dare."
5,Waiting impatiently,"With having played Larian Studios Divine Divinity and the demo of Beyond Divinity, which is not the final version, I find myself waiting impatiently waiting for the game to be released.It is set in the Divinity Universe and has alot of new features such as, Battlefields, new skills and a no class restriction. You are able to make a character with both sword and magic abilities.The voice of the Deathknight has been redone due to the facy that Larian Studios listens to it fans. The Divinity forum is by far the best forum for a game out there. Some of the forum members can even be found in the game.The music was once again done by Krill and will be without a dout very well done.I expect much more in the line of great games to come from this Belgium based team.I suggest that you spend some money on this game as you will not be disappointed."
3,How can you review an unreleased game?,"(...).Based on the demo, which was a huge download and not worth it in my opinion, I would have to agree that the voice acting is considerably worse than your average community theater group.Since I loved Divine Divinity (everything but the redundant title), I hope that this is only a feature of the demo and since I can't post this without a rating I'll give it a tentative 3 based on that demo. The control scheme and inventory, item location, and similar features in the demo is clunk compared to Divine Divinity so that would have to be radically improved over the demo before I'd consider buying this game.The premise sounds fun, the universe it's set in is intriguing and Larian's track record is great, but we'll have to wait and see. If the voice acting is the same in the game as in the demo, I predict a very quick demise for this game."
1,If I Had Known ?,"I didn't know a game company could install a program/drivers onto my computer without informing me. And, the only way to uninstall the program/drivers is to get the removal program from the game company site = it's not even included on the cd/game ?. Talk about shady and underhanded tactics. I refuse to allow anyone to have access to my computer, so this game is being returned. With so many worthy games available, I'm not going to add to what hopefully doesn't become the industry standard: ""if you want to play our game, we must have access to your computer"". The risk just doesn't outweigh the reward !"
3,Worst Voice Acting Ever,"The PC RPG elements of this game are pretty solid, but you just can't immerse yourself in the experience when your partner delivers all his dialogue (even the urgent ones) with all the conviction of a retired adult film star. It may seem like a small thing to complain about, but that just means that you have not played the game or don't understand how to truly experience a RPG."
5,Utterly Fascinating Hypothesis & Theological Investigation!,"If you love C.S. Lewis's works then this book is well worth taking the time to read. The author has taken a closer look at Lewis's defense and proposal that reason has a strong place in the Christian faith. I had not considered that before I read this book. This is a thoroughly researched and enlightening book, and will hopefully be pondered for years to come."
5,Perfect fit,"I have a Nikon D70, an extra lens, a Nikon 650 Flash unit and a few cords, manuals, batteries, tripod attachments, etc. The Tamrac Velocity 3 Messenger bag is a perfect fit for my equipment. I love the placement of the camera in the bag which allows for quick and easy access as well as a fast and safe return back to the bag. While the bag is much bigger than what I had before, I now only have one bag instead of three and all of my equipment is with me at all times. Two thumbs up!Tom Kunz"
3,There are probably better bags out there in this price range.,"This bag is really comfortable to carry around on my shoulder. Holds a D50 with kit lens, SB800 speedlight, 3 additional lenses and misc. smaller items. The size and dimensions are perfect.My only complaint is that the top flap is not padded at all, so the camera body is not protected from impact from the top. The only quick solution would be to bury the camera in the bottom, but that would make it a pain to access. I'll probably end up adhering some foam to the inside flap to protect my camera.I'll keep this bag because its comfort and design outweigh the inconvenience of having to modify it, but I would probably consider other bags first if I were to ever go shopping for another one."
4,Good Introduction To The Period,"There is nothing exceptionally new or controversial about this book, but I found it both informative and easy to read. Numerous maps help explain things, as do limited pictures and first hand accounts.If you are looking for an introduction to the Crusades, this is a good place to start."
4,Great Read. But concise means CONCISE!!!!,"Great book to read for anyone wanting to get a quick learn about the Crusades. This book is very exciting and very informative. Only one problem, Concise means Concise, don't expect to get too many details. But great for anyone wanting a starting point."
5,It looks as if new,"This book is very good and looks as if new, no sign of usage is noticed.It is a good saving."
2,Descriptions & Shipment,I would like to have more accurate description of the condition of the book (it was in much worse condition than it said). Shipment packing was in very poor condition (barely holding).
5,Make it Funky!,"This album is one of the most excellent oddities in the Boogie King's catalogue. This is best described as John Lee Hooker does a funk album. Definitely not for blues purists. There are a few straight up and down blues numbers like 'Settin' on top of the world', and 'Five Long Years', but other numbers find John dropped straight into a well-oiled, psychedlic funk machine (replete with violin solos!). I'd recommend this album to open minded John Lee Hooker fans, and also those who are into Funkadelic. 5 star weirdness."
1,This book stinks to high heaven!,I recently purchased this book from Amazon.com and it is full of bad illustrations and is poorly written. I guess when all is said and done you'll have a working view camera but if you don't have the tools to start with you might as well find a used camera somewhere and save yourself a lot of time and money. If you want a camera that is pleasing to the eye then this is not the one for you either. Check out Jon Grepstad. He's a Swede who has written a book similar to this one and his camera's are pleasing to look at and use. http://home.online.no/~gjon/
1,An environmental waste of paper,"I read the other reviews and thought it couldn't be that bad, but it is. A reasonably clever person with some engineering background could and should design a more functional and attractive view camera than that shown. For that reason the waste of time was worse than the waste of money."
2,Its not the best book on the subject... Its the only one!,"Build Your Own View Camera! is an informative book on a subject that has had little information available. Even though I only gave it two stars, I still recommend this book if you are serious about building your own camera. The book is lacking good detailed photographs- they bleed to black. Also the writing style is poor. The redeeming value of the book is that it is the only one available on the subject. So if you want to build a view camera you will save yourself some headaches if you buy the book."
2,Are those black blobs supposed to be pictures?,Pros: This book does show you how to build a functional view camera with inexpensive materials.Cons: The pictures (or the black blobs that pass for them) are the worst I've ever seen on any kind of published material. They look like Rorschach inkblot tests.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I agree with others on here,, this is not well produced,,, photo's are black blobs, and lacking information thats needed.."
5,No more liquid nitrogen!!!,"I used to use liquid nitrogen and believe me it was painful!I nearly lost one of my fingers once, but now it's all in the past all thanks to Poop Freeze. My life is now complete and worriless."
1,Freezer Works Better,This product is a waste of time. I have been getting far better results freezing my own poop using my ordinairy under counter freezer! Why would you wait for the dog to go?Pointless!
1,Somebody better check their specifications,"Last time I checked, water based products such as Poop aren't really frozen at 62 degrees F.Personally I try to catch the poop in a zip-lock bag and take it straight to the deep freeze. This prevents freezer burn and that white crusty layer."
1,no help on loose stools,"NEW! POOP-FREEZE Aerosol Freeze Spray (10 oz)This product worked fine on regular poop, so what, I can pick that up with a baggie any day. I purchased this product for when my dogs had loose stools but it did not work on hardening these stools up to prevent a messy clean up. Sorry, it appeared to be a great idea!"
2,Upside Down Canned Air,You know those cans of air you buy to clean your keyboards & other things? Try turning one of those cans upside down and spraying the poop -couple of blasts - each about 5 seconds works great! That and a putty knife lifts it right off the carpet!
3,Mildly useful,"I'd heard good things about Poop-Freeze from other pet owners, so I ordered a can. Sadly, I wasn't as impressed as I'd hoped to be. I followed the directions the first time, and instead of frozen poop, I just had cooler poop to pick up. The second time, I sprayed for longer than recommended. This gave me cold, but still not frozen, poop. Granted, if you're picking it up with a plastic baggie, cold poop is slightly more pleasant that still-warm poop, but the product implies that the poop will be frozen nearly solid and that is not the case. (Incidentally, we're talking a pug here, not a really BIG dog)."
2,"OK, but not quite up to product claims","The spray does at least partially freeze the poop all canine owners need to responsibly pickup, but it falls well short of the product claims. My family has used it under varying weather conditions and had uneven results, though we have precisely followed the directions. It is most effective (provided the directions are followed exactly) on very solid stool and least effective on soft/running stool. The obvious problem is the latter is exactly why one would purchase the product. We bought it to do a more thorough job picking up after our dogs on a multi-use trail. We bike with our dogs (using Walky Dog) and like to leave the trail as clean as possible for others and to ensure dogs continue to be permitted to use the trail. The product did not help as much as we had hoped. When our multi-can supply runs out, I don't think we will purchase more."
2,Wag more Bark Less,"They don't explain you not only have to take the can out but then find and put the straw on..not easy with 1,2,3 or 4 dogs on leashes. Then the item does freeze the mess but also the grass. Also you need to turn the item over and freeze the back ""according to the instructions"".. I have been unable to do this. I guess its an art... like... flipping pancakes.The freeze spray does help but don't expect it to be anything like the commercial"
2,Does not work well with Great Danes or English Mastiff's,One can is not enough for a movement from either of my dogs. I try to be proactive by feeding them lots of popsicles. It does seem to work better in the winter though.
2,Battery Dead on arrival and unchargable,"I was able to get about two weeks use out of this when my old ipod was plugged into a power source, and now that doesn't even work. That said, it was relatively easy to replace and worth the try to extend the life of an iPod that Apple won't work on anymore. May try again with another replacement battery."
3,The dawn of a new nation,"Jose Mattoso is one of the brightest medieval historians in Portugal. His work on the foundations of Portugal, which this one is the most complete, has enabled students and everyone interested in portuguese medieval history to identify the structures, the people and the means that permitted it to stand until now. The combination of nouvelle histoire, geography and political history is the biggest trace of this work, divided in two volumes - oposition and composition. Do read it and, if possible, translate it to varoius languages for it is outstanding. One of the best in portuguese medieval historiography."
3,David Essex is One of a Kind,"I'm only rating this CD a 3 because David Essex is not to everyone's taste. I love him, though, and all the songs on this album. His voice has a dream like quality, rich tones, and a hint of magic.My opinion may be a little biased, however, because David Essex's album ""All the Fun of the Fair"" was the very first one I ever owned. I have been a fan for 25 years, and wish more of his music was available in the US.Thanks, Amazon, for giving us ""The Best""!"
3,2.5 - 3 Stars,"This is a very good CD in some ways, however it has some not so good songs on it as well. Of the 16 songs I like a total of 7 just under half, get the other Greatest hits indtead as has better number of hit songs on it"
2,"One-hit wonder, nothing more.","Best known for ""Rock On"", the rest isn't much stylisticly similar, it's feeble '60's attempt at God-knows-what - it's not really Pop, and it's definitely not Rock and Roll. NOT RECOMMENDED!"
3,Certification Review For Pharmacy Technicians,"Beware, this manual lists the top 200 ""fast movers"" and tells you you need to find all the monograph information and that you need to know what warning labels to use, but does not have any of that information in the book. The math section is a little skimpy also."
2,Too many errors,"I purchased this review book with the understanding that it was written and edited by professionals. I am into the second practice test and I have found several errors. ONE IS CRITICAL. I will write another review when I have finished all the practice tests (there are 5), and update any further discrepencies.At this point I would NOT recommend this book to anyone studying for the PTCB for the first time."
3,Sufficient but a tight fit,"I bought these for selling CD/DVD/video games on Ebay and through trial and error was able to use them. It is a little frustrating at first as most cases will be a struggle to get all the way in resulting in torn envelops and I'm not even sure if the recipient will be able to take it out without just cutting the envelop open.Some tips for people who do buy anyways because it is cheap:- Make sure the insertion of the case into the opening isn't tearing the envelop or rolling back the bubble-wrapping.- Once inserted, put the end of the case on a flat surface (table or your knee) while holding the left & right edges of the envelop pull down. (if the case gets misaligned, pull it back out of the envelop a bit and try again)- Lastly, when you need to get the case to fit all the way in the envelop; with one hand hold the inside of the envelop that doesn't have the flap (making sure to grab a hold of the bubble-wrapping), and press the case down with other hand."
2,Solitary Man,"Had hoped this music was same as his music written for ""Cat People"", among the movie sound tracks Moroder has been involved with over the years. I was disappointed."
1,Poor Quality,Item arrived appearing to be the quality expected for the paid price. It wasn't used enough to get it dirty before the bottom fell out of it. It was apparant from checking it that it was defective workmanship. Army Universe said it was past the return date so I had to just eat the $70.00.
2,"Purchased five months ago, developing tears despite only light use",I purchased this backpack about five months ago and initially was impressed with the product. It appeared sturdy and well-constructed and was reasonably comfortable to carry. I've been using it lightly since - no more than a couple of days a month carrying loads up to twenty pounds. Unfortunately the stitching at the bottom corners of the backpack (the bottom two corners of the main compartment that are closest to the wearer's back) has started to open up. One corner is entirely open such that there's a one inch gap in the corner through which objects can fall and the other corner is starting to unravel but is not yet open. I haven't been carrying any sharp or unusual objects that should cause this to happen so I have to give this product only two stars.
5,Great bag at a reasonable price.,"Great price and a sturdy item that will be used as a BOB. Plenty of room to attach more MOLLE items.The fancier the camo pattern the more expensive the bag. Living in the desert, coyote brown works for me and was the least expensive."
1,Junk,"Not made very well, only two compartments. The straps hurt your shoulders and are hard to adjust. There is no padding at all for your back and sides. And they are charging 52.00 for this very poorly made back pack... I am sending it back. I've spent a dollar more for a Field and Stream pack that was 10 times better than this one. I will be glad to spend more for a higher quality pack. Should have stayed with the Molle pack I bought in ACU, that's a really good pack. I just wanted a differant color and chose this. Never again..."
2,not unless you're a yeti,"seemed to be good quality, but the straps in the smallest position were still much too large for my 220lb relatively unathletic frame. I sent it back for a refund"
5,MOLLE Pack,Very good back pack holds alot of stuff. It also has a great back support and has alot of space for attachments to the bag. Great buy!
2,"Quality materials, miserable strap layout","This is a really nice bag with one exception. The waist straps are only adjustable at the point where you snap them together in the front. They have no tensioners at the hip, and are extremely long. Unless you're an 800 lb grizzly bear, the waist straps will be utterly useless, making all the weight of your pack ride only on your shoulders and chest. Sadly, I never even got to use this pack, and had to return it. The build quality of the bag is good. Great, reinforced stitching and heavy duty nylon with unlimited points for attachments and carabiners. If they get this obviously overlooked waist strap in working order, it would be a 5 star bag."
4,Decent BIG pack,"This has been a good pack so far. I originally bought it with the intention of using it to carry books for school as well as camping and range time on the weekends. When it arrived, I quickly realized that it was way to big for a pack to carry a few books and a laptop in. With that being said, I use it (more appropriately as a 3 day pack for camping.Being an assault pack, the bag has no hard frame and is of a more lightweight design. Don't look for much support from the pack if you intend on carrying a lot of weight with it.I pulled the belt off as soon as I got it because it rode too high for where I like to where a bag. The belt is a wide nylon strap with a buckle and hip pads on either side.Overall this has been a good bag."
5,love it so much!,"This is a must get for any camping or long day on the road. If your in the Military then this bag is great has one deep pocket and the other deep but not as big. As it says 3 Day Assault pack anything with you, you can pack in with the 3 days great or one more day.PRO- great for anything good for water proof ( not saying go swimming with it on but if you get in a dip and out it will keep your things dry). great lasting M.O.L.L.E.Con- Height oh the straps but i fit in it good but not a one size fits all type of deal but it will fit mostly all."
4,Great buy,"I bought this backpack on monday and it arrived on wednesday with standard shipping. the backpack is very strong and i will be using it to go on FTX and other rotc events.The zippers are heavy and are hard to zip up at first, also the waist strap is way big. i weigh around 150 pounds, and when i tightened it all they way it didnt come close to touching my waist, so i just cut it off, i wouldnt use it anyways.the shoulder straps are well padded, and the MOLLE loops are tight and well stitched.overall a good buy that will hopefully last me a while"
3,DATELINE EUROPE,THIS CD CAN BE ENJOYED ON 2 LEVELS. THERE IS A LYRICAL DIZ AND A FUNNY DIZ. LISTIN TO THE PSEUDO-DIXILAND OPENING OF THE GERSWIN TUNE S'WONDERFUL AND THEN HEAR HIM ON THE BEAUTIFUL MOON NOCTURNE. ITS SORT OF A CASUAL ALBUM FROM 3 SESSIONS IN PARIS IN THE EARLY 50'S. NOT A MUST TO GET BUT ENJOYABLE DIZZY NEVERTHELESS
1,It comes unmade and it isn't easy to put it together.,"A fondue maker is a pure luxury item. They charge 80 bucks for a fancy pot when I can make fondue on the stovetop. All it really does is keep the fondue warm. When I bought the Arose 11 Piece Fondue Set I expected it have instructions and for it to be intact. If you look at the picture of the set, you will see three stainless steal pillars. The problem is the cup that holds the burner will not fit through the pillars. It isn't easy to remove the screws that connect the pillars to the set. After the cup is inserted, then the set is in pieces and it isn't easy put the pillars back. A hint is you have to bend the set to reattach the pillars. Clearly, Swissmar isn't interested in quality."
2,Not as pictured!!!,"I already have a band-it tool that has a built in cutter and t-handle, but it's bulky and falls apart. The pictured tool is what the first car dealership I worked at provided, and it worked great. Simple and compact. I ordered this twice before giving up. Each time I received what I already own. The tool has been drastically altered, but the item's photo has not been updated. The tool works, but it's not what I want."
4,works fine,"Works just as I expected, Which is fairly easy but takes some practice. Buy an extra band the first time around just in case."
3,"Different, Different, Different","Different, different, different. This book moved at an extraordinary fast pace. One moment you are witnessing Pearline's physical abuse then two pages later she is pregnant with twins by another man that she now proclaims to love.If you are looking for a book with a lot of action, drama and suspense, I don't recommend this novel. I found this book to be very superficial. There really was not substance to this book. I finished the book, but I kept wanting for something to happen. Maybe that is the affect Ms. Thomas was trying to achieve. This book was definitely different."
3,"for $40, and i bought 2.","These were terrible. I returned them. They were the thickness of a cheap terry cloth rag you'd buy at the autoparts store to wax a car or wipe off tools. They were not fitted or taylored in any way. They had elastic but this is junk. Thier like a cheap terry cloth crib sheet.Instead, consider buying a terry cloth shower curtain and maybe some velcrow. You can make better on you own.To the people who sold this to me:Don't carry these anymore. These are below anyone's standards. Shame on taylormade."
5,Unbelievable!,Open Up Your Heart is a true classic. I bought it after hearing the Choir on Fox News in the Morning and just love it. It is a must have and makes a great gift!
5,you need this book,while reading this book I was better able to understand why my kids did the things they did. the examples in the chapters offer terrific guidance for helping us with our teenagers. many of the illustrations are funny examples of how kids behave and then the author offers advice on how to handle each situation. The chapter on young men and women gives excellent advice on how to handle sex and dating and stuff like that. buy this book it will be a good investment for your family sanity.
1,Do not buy!,"The speakers were terrible and tinny sounding. I guess that is what can be expected for the price. I would have returned them, but with the cost of shipping them back, there would have been no point."
5,My daughter loves it!,"This item was delivered on time, in good condition and as expected from the description provided. My daughter loves it!"
1,A comic book supervillain,"I don't see how anyone could take these novels' worldview seriously. The ""antichrist"" is like a supervillain from a comic book. He wouldn't seem out of place as the arch-enemy of the Justice League or the X-Men. People who think that Jesus is going to drop from the sky in their lifetimes to solve their problems are going to die disappointed just like previous generations of simpletons who got caught up in this Dispensationalist nonsense."
4,****AWESOME****,This latest intallation of the left behind series is extremely well done and will keep readers on the edge of their seats. The character devlopement remains consistent and even for those who already know a bit about the end times the story remains very exciting. Readers who enjoy this fictionalized version on endtime events may also want to pick up ***REVELATION UNSEALED*** by author Donald A Salerno which is an excellent non-fiction depiction of what the Apocalypse has to say about this final period of human history.
1,"Tim and Jerry: Please, just let it go...NOW!!!","Started this series in early June being fairly satisfied and have just finished the The Glorius Appearing. Though the writing was very redundant and often times prejudicial in most of the books, I pressed on, overlooking the authors' biases and thinking surely the authors would leave reader electrified in their conclusion of events, but...OH WOW! HOW DISAPPOINTING WAS THAT? From a Christian perspective, I can't embrace their notion of God as this murderous character he was portrayed to be. In the end, I couldn't helping thinking that there was not much difference in the way God and Satan dealt with the disloyal. That's not the loving God I envision. From a storytelling perspective with a few exceptions, this book JUST DIDN'T DO WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE. THE TRAIN HAS SURELY LEFT THE STATION GUYS...NO MORE SEQUELS/PREQUELS!"
1,A Disappointment,"I know writing about Jesus must be a tremendously challenging task. God is not easily confined to the printed page! However, if Jesus is anything like his portrayl in this book, I am going to be seriously disappointed. (And Jesus will never disappoint!) His portrayl was wooden and rather lifeless, greatly sapping the energy from this novel. Left Behind was a wonderful book, making one truly ponder one's religious convictions. However, each subsequent book has become more complex and bogged down in complicated events and an overabundance of characters. I'd advise new readers to read Left Behind (and maybe Tribulation Force) and call it quits."
2,Finally Over!,"First of all, thank goodness its finally over! I loved it, but was growing tiresome. By the time the Glorious Appearing came out, I just wanted to get it over with. I was afraid to get my hopes up on an 'awesome book', and i'm glad that I didnt. I mean, how could anyone possibly describe what its going to be like when jesus/god comes back? I knew it was going to be difficult to fictionalize. The storyline suffered quite a bit, which left an EXTREME amount of preaching (well, thats what i called it). I felt like it was being shoved down my throat at times. I was somewhat disappointed in the book, yet at the same time I wasnt, because I knew well...how would YOU describe the end of days? I wasnt too keen on the idea of everyone being chummy @the end (the raptured w/those left behind) but hey, its done,over, and all in all a pleasant series. I'm just not going to get caught up in another ""left behind"" series. I think one left behind series is enough for me!"
2,"Jesus Finally Returns, But Not That Great, Really.","Like one previous reviewer noted, the previous book gave you the impression that the Second Coming was mere minutes away, and it turned out to be 200+ pages into the book, and when Jesus *does* come back, 95% of what He says is just Scripture, giving me the impression, at least, He had no personality of His own. When He speaks to a believer, though, it's truly moving to read.The angels had the same problem, too.Not the best, really. I'd recommend the third prequel, The Rapture."
5,Glorious Appearing,This is a great book. I just loved when they wrote how Christ returned to Earth. It was so gripping I could not put the book down. I look forward to reading the next title i this series. The whole series is a must read for anyone. [...]
4,"First of all, to the guy ranting about LaHaye","You're supposed to be reviewing the book. This is not a forum to voice your opinions about Tim LaHaye.This book was pretty good. I'm glad the series is finally over. I enjoyed the first few and then continued reading just because I wanted to find out what would happen next, even though I wasn't that impressed with the writing any more."
2,Impossible,The eschatology of the writers blinds them to the truth. This is because they believe the resurrection is before the tribulation. Jesus said the resurrection is after the tribulation on the last day. All of the parables of Christ teach we must be doing the will of God to be worthy to escape the tribulation. He that speaks lies will not escape regardless of intentions. The greatest deceptions always came through the church.
3,I had higher hopes,"I have loved the Left Behind Series! But, this final chapter was disappointing. It was a slow read and not a page turner like the other books. Most of all I missed the fantastic mental images the prior books evoked."
1,"Liked the series, hated this book","Ok, so the last few books started to drag. Unfortunately, this one came to a dead stop. I love Christian fiction, and enjoyed the first few books in the series, however this book is terrible! The characters are two-dimensional characatures of their former selves, their actions and the dialog is absurd! Did Tim & Jerry even write these books? This was such a missed opportunity, because the RIGHT ending could have made the series a good evangelistic tool to get non-believers thinking and asking questions. I'll stop recommending the series because this is such an awful ending."
1,God is Love,"""And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?""When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are you so eager to condemn those around you who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest that you work on bringing yourself closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to your idea of how God wants us to live."
2,Had to read it 'cause I'd already read the other 11 books!,"I don't mean to slam LaHaye or Jenkins, because the series really was a good idea, however....The series really dragged on towards the end - 8 books would have been plenty.The theology is slavishly literal - even things that are obviously meant to be symbolic.The characters are shallow and the writing is elementary.The whole premise and execution becomes a caricature by the end. The writing is stilted and predictable.I would recommend the Last Disciple by Brouwer as a much better written novel based on revelation prophecy - of course the theology is much different than LaHaye's"
1,Don't waste your valuable time!,"To put it bluntly, this book was more tedious than a bad church sermon. I'm not a christian, and after reading this book, would definetly be less inclined then ever to convert! If I wanted a book which quoted scripture verbatim, and read like a sunday school primer, I would have bought one. To say this book is simple minded is to pay it a compliment! If heaven is filled with morons like this, sign me up for the flames baby...."
2,Disappointing... at best.,"I was looking forward to the release of this book for almost a year. I was at the bookstore on the day it came out. Unfortunately, Glorious Appearing left much to be desired. It is full of filler, quotes from The Bible, and nothingness. I wanted so badly to enjoy reading it, as I have read the previous books and loved them. But this is not impressive.The wars are fought. Of course, we win, since nothing can harm the children of God. The Lord returns. And that is it! THE END!I am a born-again Christian who believes that the order of events in the books are correct. I know much about the Bible, and have done my homework when it comes to The Gospel. I am thankful that the series has led people to Christ, but I am sorry to say that this book has failed to entertain me."
5,Glorious Book,The very last chapters of this book stand out in my mind even though it has been years since I read this book. The whole series brought the Scriptures to life for me and put faces to the people who were left behind. This is a very good read.
4,GLORIOUS APPEARING,"PART OF THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES DEPICTING THE REVALTIONS BOOK OF THE BIBLE IN MODERN TERMS WITH WELL WRITTEN CHARACTERS .. WHILE EACH OF THESE BOOKS CAN STAND ALONE AND ONE GET THE STORY IN EACH BOOK, THEY ARE BEST READ IN SEQUENCE. THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL DONE AND BELIEVEABLE."
3,not my favorite of series,"Overall the series is great, but this was my least favorite one. I would have liked it to go into more detail between those who had died with those still living!"
2,Read them all,"I have read all of the left behind series, I really enjoyed the early books. The last few have seemed to be getting monotonous, and this is a book full of filler."
2,Not as Good,"I've read all 12 Left Behind books and loved the first 11. Book 12, Glorious Apprearing, I thought was long and drawn out. What they covered in almost 400 pages could have better done in half that. For the last installment, that should have been the best with the coming of Christ, was a big let down."
3,Yes This was a fiction series but it was great!,"Yes this was a fiction book but still it was told well and for the review by -N. Gordillo ""bookworm-This book was about CHRIST not Mary. Mary is and was not our savior and has NO part in CHRISTS Glorious Appearing. This was about our lords glorious day.Get a clue because if your counting on Mary to come and save you your in sad shape.Jeffrey"
2,The End of days?,"I liked the serie, but this was a book that i think the writers needed to fill the pages. I am a fast reader but not with this book, I still have not finished it. lot of Bla di bla.I thought that the glorious Appearing would happen fast."
2,I thought this was supposed to be a novel,"There is a fair amount of sermonizing in the previous books, but it was excessive in this last one. I relize that these books serve a dual purpose (witnessing & entertainment?), but there was so much talking that this book dragged and was very anticlimactic. I am very disappointed with this series's conclusion."
1,Glorious Dis-Appearing,"Like many, I'd read the entire series up to this point. This book reads like something that was churned out merely to make money. ""Hokey"" would be a good summation. In the book, Jesus sounds like an animatronic figure from the Disney lab.A majority of the Christian fiction novels are variations on the End Times theories. The writers seem to be scraping the barrel now, for grist for their creative mill. Enough of this End Times obsession. Surely, there must something else to write about."
3,The culmination of the Tribulation story,"Like the other eleven books in the series, this book is basically well-written and entertaining. However, I got the feeling that the authors were trying to ""flesh it out"" for word count, so the book would be pretty much the same size as the others.A certain amount of scripture has become the norm for these stories, but the authors overload it this time, often repeating themselves several different ways. It slowed down the story and made Jesus look a bit like a gabby braggart (just a bit).In spite of that, it was still a good read and a good wrap-up to the story (except for ""Kingdom Come"").Interesting bit: my Trade paperback book has the same cover art as the hardback edition."
1,So disappointing...,"I read 12 books in 30 days (thanks to my public library).I really liked the characters, not so jazed about the religious preaching (I'm an atheist) but I kept an open mind, and enjoyed most of the first 10. By the time I got to 11, I was pushing my way through, convinved 12 would be worth it. Nope.I really liked the charactes, and thought book 12 would give good description as to the reunions of past characters. That is what I wanted, what I cared about.I think I got one, maybe two paragraphs at the end of the book. What a let down!!! After pushing through 12, 400 page books, I felt like I deserved more! You can bet I will be very hesitant about reading the pre-quel that is rumored to come out later."
1,Left Behind is Right,"At the beginning...I thought they had something with the Left Behind series. At the very least, a way to reach out to a lost world with the message of hope and salvation in the Lord. With each subsequent book, however, the story line got weaker and weaker, until at the last- it was so far fetched and poorly written it was difficult to finish the book. I found myself wishing for a different author who could truly capture the essense of this story and deliver on the goods...certainly this shallow portrayal did not begin to tell the story! Not only is it poorly written, it jumps around from undeveloped thought to undeveloped thought. Shallow, uninspiring and hurriedly written, it leaves one with the idea that the author(s)just simply wanted to move on and be done with it all. Save your money- this book isn't worth your $ or your time."
1,I'd give it a zero if I could.,"I've read all the previous Left Behind books and this one is by far the worst. It was so painful to read I almost didn't get through it. I used to be the biggest fan of this series and recommended it to everyone, but this book was horrible. No plot for the characters I liked and way too much scripture for filler. As if reading all of the scripture wasn't bad enough, they repeated it over and over in the book. Save your money. If you have to read it, check it out at the library."
1,Another Doctrine of Ethnic Cleansing?,"In some ways this book is funny yet profoundly stupid. The writers Tim F. Lehaye and Jerry B. Jenkins have gloriously taken away the essence of Jesus Christ, which is Love. Their version of the bible is a doctrine of fear(almost sounds like the fear tactics of the current American Bush administration). And since when does Jesus like to kill horses? This is an important clue already that this is pure wacko stuff. Have we got another childish and primative interpretation of the bible here by these two silly-billys?Yes,people have a right to believe in a God who likes to rip open bodies and melt flesh into bloody messes. But I only hope they can keep their religious intolerance to themselves. If there is a devil, he certainly did a good job on these pious people who claim to love the book."
5,Best for last,This series has been a long time coming. Nearly ten years. It's finally coming to an end. (at least I think) I read this book in two days. Everything that the characters have endured with Carpatia and what carpathia has done to the world is finally avenged in this book. It's glorious.
5,Awesome Ending to a wonderful Series!!!,I loved the Glorious appearing and I cried through the whole second half of the book. It was so cool to imagine Jesus's return to the earth. It was great. I thought they did an awesome job!
3,To everyone who bashes these books....CALM...DOWN!!!,"What is it with certain types of people who get fired up aboutFICTIONAL STORIES!!!I'm sure they are the same people who get fired up about the Da Vinci Code and Micheal Moore movies.Relax folks. They are JUST FICTIONAL STORIES!!! Meant to entertain...not reality.Please stop weaving fiction in to your perception of life!I absolutely love the review on the 1st page from the ""Christian Propoganda"" guy. :) Take a look a all the books he has reviewed... He copied and pasted the same text to review EVERY Left Behind book. Funny. It makes me wonder if the words are his or if they were copied and pasted from a left wing nutjob website. :) I would hate to have to live my life with such hatred in my heart."
1,dissapointed,"I have all of the other books and was looking forward to this one. I have a few problems with the event order. Although Revelations is not in chrono order, I never read where Jesus returned judged ALLLLLLLL and THEN reign for 1000 years (NO ONE IS LEFT) I know this is just your way to write another book but it degraded the great job you had done in the past. You should have made this the last book and not make room for more. Your series just lost its appeal to me with this book. Just my opinion!! But I guess after The Passion of Christ all books and movies pale in comparison.---"
1,These guys must be stopped!!,"There's not really much to say here. It just scares me to think about the impact these two douche bags have on so many people. I mean alot of folks out there believe in this garbage. Scary stuff....So let me get this strait...we're supposed to follow this psycho maniac named Jesus who flings people into fire only because they are non believers?? It's like he gets a righteous boner watching eyeballs melt and skin disintegrate...Lahaye and Jenkins have distorted the simple, yet beautiful message of Christ. Way to go fellas!!! Congrats on the book sales!!!"
1,Heretical nonesense,"This book is heretical nonesense and it is tragic that so many good Christians are being taken in by a nineteenth century invented heresy, called premillennial dispensationalism. Read Iain Murray's THE PURITAN HOPE and discover the genuine, biblically based truth about the end times. If you are a bible believing Christian, and, thank God I am included, then you want to base your theology on the Word of God and not what some nineteenth century guy (Darby) and two twenty-first century authors thought up. Jenkins can write (La Haye can't) but this is no reason to buy into non-Scriptural, unbiblical theology."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the quality of this book. It's hard to explain but just trying to repeat verses in the bible as opposed to conveying how people would be at the second coming. I just couldn't relate. If you are an ""in Christian"", one could see that this is from the bible, but I thought these books were also for the mass market, and people could gain so much of Jesus through these books. I'm aware of some people who have become engrossed in these books, and I don't think they will be able to understand the last book. It just wasn't in simple enough language. And Jesus just was too distant. He is so much more than was conveyed."
4,willing to work with me,the seller is awesome..just having probs getting my book but she is willing to refund me totally since this was the last day to get the book and I still dont have it!
1,Not too bad for pulp fiction,"I read this last one just to find out what happened to the characters and see how the authors would portray the Christ. Picked it up at the airport, read it by turning through any diatribes, and left it with my discarded earphones when the plane landed.The series reminded me of those horrible comic books my little sister brought home in the 80s. They self-aggrandized whatever evangelical church it was and demonized all other religions. Thank God my father banned the comic books from the house and installed in us unconditional love and a hunger to be like Ascended Master Jesus THE Christ. Why do they call Jeshua bin Josef by his title like it's a surname anyway? Oh well, good thing He and the others love us so much and want US ALL Home. And Thank God He has a good sense of humour."
1,This was the worst book of the series (of 12),"Judging the series as a whole I would give it two stars, but this book deserves the lowest rating this scale provides. Poor characterization is the downfall of this series to me, but poor editing and prioritization was the problem with this book."
2,disappointing,"I have read some of the other ""negative"" reviews and have found them to be frustrating. They seem to be railing at the theology - the reviewers don't believe the theological premise for the series, and that is what they are rating. That doesn't seem to be a fair rating of the book itself as a book. I am personally okay with the premise - I guess we will all find out whose interpretation is correct when the time comes. I just plain found this book to be a disappointment. I felt like the actual story could have been told in 1/3 of the pages - most of it was recitation of scripture or of scripture related statements. The plot was extremely thin, and I was truly disappointed to have the series end this way - maybe they should have covered the real plot points of this book in the previous one and let it end there."
2,Just a comment...,"I want to clear up a few things on the book so that what I say isn't misinterpreted1) I do feel that their writing style is below what could be done, the prose is simple but it does also mean a larger number of people can read it easily.2) As harsh as it is, what happened to the non-believers is fairly accurate scripturally based on my understanding (I'm not a theologian so I realize I can be wrong on this). The thing is this, God doesn't put us in hell, we put ourselves in hell. That's why believers call themselves 'saved', saved from hell by God's grace and faith in the messiah. The belief is basically Jesus is a parachute when jumping from a plane, he saves you, keeps you from dying, that sort of thing.3) I admit, from what I did read in it I was more than a little disturbed by the glee that they had in their descriptions of the deaths of the nonbelievers. These people deserve our compassion, not hate or venom, love thy enemy."
1,Still propagating opinion,"As this endless series about the end continues, one must wonder if the Author has a Bible. Good question. Why propigate a doctrine just because it is what you were taught. Open the Bible. See what it really says. If you're spending money on books, buy these 3, they'll change your world. ""This Church is not Appearing Glorious, & it doesn't seem to be Purpose Driven"" by Meyers, ""Holiness Truth & the Presence of God"" by Frangipane, and ""Why Revival Tarries"" by Ravenhill. If you're only a Church goer, then Lahaye is your man, But if you want to be a Christian, then you can do much better."
3,"Enough already, LaHaye and Jenkins","This is the 12th book in series and not a bad one. However is does suffer the same as the previous six and that caused by making the series too long (were to be only six at first). The ""filler"" in these books causes it to bog for serveral pages at a time and sometimes lessens the dramatic effect. LaHaye and Jenkins are planning, it appears, to have sequel AND a prequel, even though it was promised this was to be the last in the series. I hope it is not for the sake of making a few more dollars, a shame if it is. Remember, even in the Bible, LaHaye and Jenkins, there is even an END TIMES. Time to end this series. I am a believer and quite familiar with the bible, so those people that are new to the bible read the following carefully: These books are fictional and are NOT literal translations of the Book of Revelations."
2,"Obviously predictable, but too drawn out","This series had to end the way it did, with the glorious appearing, but as usual, the autors failed to get us there in a quick fashion. The story had very little action, except for the decimaion of the enemy which was anything but action packed. What was left of the main characters (maybe two of the main 12 in the series)had ver little to say except, ""Rayford was happy"" then ""Mac was happy"", then ""Chang was happy"" I found myself skipping pages full of Bible text which was far too overwhelming for a non-christian who loved the series for action, and good story telling (see books 1-6, not 7-12). I also noticed that in the last few books, Carpathia, who was an interesting character, became a shadow of his former self, and not a superhuman as he was in earlier books. On the whole, I am glad that I read this series,but it easily could have been done in 6 or 7 books. Now I see there is a sequel and prequel? I doubt that I can sit through two more of these novels."
1,Great book - terrible transaction.,"This is not about the product, but the seller. I was told the product was new. It was clearly used and even had a bookmark in the middle. Great book. Very disappointing transaction."
3,Disappointing for the Last Book,"I have loved the Left Behind series and am looking forward to more in the new series, Babylon Rising. The book did not match the action and suspense with the biblical prophet writing as they have in the other books. As much as I would give the Left Behind series as a whole 10 stars, this final book barely made 3 stars for me. Of course, every series must conclude..."
1,What Can I Say?,"The book says that I die. It literally says that I, someone who has never met Timothy LaHaye in my life, deserve to be KILLED, and not just killed but eviscerated, and it celebrates my sentencing to a lake of fire as ""righteous"". WTF? This is how it describes my death:""But even as they struggled, their own flesh dissolved, their eyes melted and their tongues disintegrated... leaving grotesque skeletons standing, before they, too, rattled to the pavement.""These aren't evil people. They're just people who don't believe in Jesus! That's what Jesus does to every single non-Evangelical and non-Christian on the planet in Timothy LaHaye's book. Take a good look, because there's only one type of person who could possibly enjoy reading this book, and if there were a benevolent God those people would be put away in a very distant place where they could no longer be a danger to the rest of us."
1,So glad it's finally over...,"Let me begin by saying:1. I am a Christian.2. I believe the Bible is a literal, wholly truthful account given to us directly by God.3. This series lowered my IQ, drained me of all energy and left me longing for the hours and dollars I invested in it.After picking up the first book I realized it was interesting though poorly written. Not wanting to start something without finishing it, I kept buying this dreck until I finally completed the series. I would not recommend these books to anyone, Christian or Non-Christian.I do think the potential for fictionalizing the story of the Rapture/Tribulation period is awesome, unfortunately these ""books"" fell far short of reaching any sort of literary goal. (Financial goals, of course, were surpassed.)"
1,Disappointing End to a Disappointing Series,"A terrible ending to the entire series. There was so much more that could have been done with this finale. Character development - nonexistent. Plot development - nearly none. The first two-thirds of this book read like an extended Bible tract. What is brought forth in 300-plus pages could just as easily have been accomplished in a front-back printing on a single sheet of paper, which would be stuck under your windshield wiper at the local mall. The last third of the book comes off like an awards banquet more than anything else. Parts of the series were well worth the efforts of the authors, but so much more could have been done with it - and wasn't."
2,The series ends with a fizzle,"This was by far the poorest book in the entire series. The series started out as a strong and creative interpretation of what Bible prophecies could mean, but also it was just plain great story-telling. It had an appeal to Christians and non-Christians alike because it was a good read. Somewhere along the line the authors lost the edge. It really shows in this final book, it is nothing more than page after page of direct scripture quotes and sorry attempts to tie together loose ends with side stories that read like afterthoughts. I never imagined the end times and return of Jesus could be portrayed to be so B-O-R-I-N-G!! It sounds more exciting in the Bible than in this horribly dry read."
1,Leave this book behind!!,"So Christ appears on his white steed with a sash across his torso that says, ""King of Kings""???? The Remnant with supernatural running skills as senior citizens and children race across the desert at 100mph? (Couldn't our Lord just teleport them from place to place?) PUH-LEEZ!!!This is supposed to be the CLIMAX...Lahaye & Jenkins knew they were going to squeeze 12 books out of us, couldn't they take the time to provide us with something other than this poorly written ANT-CLIMACTIC drivel??Being a Greek Orthodox Christian, I was hooked after the first book (even though they got steadily got worse)...but I still kept the faith! But as we all know, sometimes the Lord's answer is no. No to this book..."
1,This book was painful to read,"After following this series from the beginning, and finding it at times enthralling, this final installment was so anticlimatic it was painful. The entire sub-plot following the believers in Chicago was a total waste of time and so uninteresting, I couldn't even remember who they were from the previous books. I found myself skimming over the massive dialogue issuing forth from the mouth of Jesus for the entire last 1/3 of the book as it was extremely repetitive and actually boring. Spare us from authors who think they can do credit to an event that is surely outside the realm of human comprehension."
1,What a letdown,"Sorry, this book made me regret reading the whole series. It may be biblical but it's not the Jesus I've come to know in my heart."
3,Add me to the list,"Add me to the list of people who think The Christ Clone Trilogy and Conquest of Paradise are greatly superior to the Left Behind Series. I still like Left Behind, and I bought Glorious Appearing, because I'm interested in the characters. But as for explaining prophecy, the Book of Revelation, the tribulation, and everything else about the end times, and for telling a story that seems truly real, The Christ Clone Trilogy and Conquest of Paradise do a far better job, hands down! It was fun while it lasted, but I'm ready to move on."
3,"Disappointing, but still, it's an ending","The first half of this book was pretty good, but then it fizzled out. I kind of felt evil when I kept skipping the parts when Jesus talked. They tended to overkill ideas. For example, when everyone hears Jesus say their name at the same time. I got the idea the first time. The second time wasn't too bad, but when they repeated the idea over and over, it got boring. All in all, though, it was an ending."
2,The story fell down,I was eager to get the this book but found it fell short of the others. Way too much time was devoted to scripture compared to the others. Very disappointed.
4,Two more to go,"I have really enjoyed this series. I do think that it is being drawn out further than I would prefer. But I enjoy each of these books very much.Like the others, this book is a good example of what the authors view as the ideal. It is also a way to see how the author interoperates the Bible especially the apocalypse. The authors are very talented in writing action fiction. The work goes very fast and is an easy read.This is not a good book for a serious debate about the book of Revelation. The book takes a particular interpretation of that book of the bible and tells a fictional story based upon a portion of the teachings of the Bible as they are understood by the authors.I highly enjoy the series and recommend it to anyone."
1,Buying into the Culture of Fear,"Please do not read these books & further brainwash yourselves. These books are all based on the fear of death and whether or not you will achieve eternal bliss. How about instead of praying for the end of the world, you sit back and enjoy life as it is. The fact that these types of books are shaping our country's foreign policy is disgusting. No wonder we are killing ourselves off."
1,Read with caution,"Given Mr. LaHaye's association with Rev. Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church, it is difficult to accept his peculiar interpretations of Biblical prophecy as credible."
5,Glorious Appearing,The book arrived within the promised time frame. Would certainly buy from Amazon again.
5,THE KING HAS RETURNED!,"With ""Glorious Appearing,"" Tim Lahaye and Jerry B. Jenkins bring their ""Left Behind"" series to an end. And the wait turned out to be worthwhile. For those who felt that the series had little emotional impact, you will find this to not only be the most emotionally-charged book in the series, but the most emotionally-stirring novel, period. The scenes of Christ's return are beautifully written, and you feel like Jesus is with you as you read this book. The characters are fully developed, and each experience they have will touch you like no other book except for the Bible ever has. ""Glorious Appearing"" is a masterpiece of the written language; an exciting and emotional look at the end of days. Fans will not be disappointed. Grade: A+P.S. Although this is the end of this series of books, Lahaye and Jenkins do have a prequel and sequel novel in the works. I look forward to these with great anticipation!"
1,Literary Hell,"After slogging through all 12 books of this series, I feel compelled to write this short review, if for no other reason than saving a few souls from illiteracy hell. The only reason I got here myself is Cormac McCarthy taking too long to write his next novel.The first few books - silly but funThe middle books -very silly but sloooowThe penultimate books - very, very silly and very, very slowThe last book - extremely silly, glacial pace and very, very sick (Jesus sending millions plummeting into the fiery pits of Hell with a mere lift of his wrist as his adorning sycophants bow. Their crimes? - among other things, blasphemy. Sound familiar?)The takeaway lessons:Absolutely anyone should be able to write a best seller, given the right target audience.Religious fundamentalists, of any stripe, are extremely scary people."
3,Ran Out of Steam,"I loved the series and think everyone should read every book, including this one. I'm glad I did. I do feel like the authors ran out of steam a bit here in the end and, as a result, the writing may have suffered a bit. I spent several years reading this series and really hoped for the same enthusiasm in writing about the coming of Jesus as I saw in Trib Force (the second and, in my opinion, best written story of the entire series). Still, I recommend you read the entire series."
3,Only Read if you MUST Finish the Series,"This novel took me forever to get through. But alas, I finally finished it. Woo-Hoo! I have now completed the entire original left behind saga. As I started reading this series I was drawn in to the character and the storyline. I read constantly, usually finishing a book in three or four days. But by the time this one rolled around I had lost interest. The series is simply too long, and each book has the same formula:1. The GC oppresses the believers.2. Some believers are killed.3. Miracles happen sparing some lives, and those are ignored by the GC.4. The GC commits war crimes against innocent civilians.5. One of the spiritual leaders gives a lecture or sermon about the grace of God.6. Repeat.It just got old after a while. But, after going through the first 11 books I had to finish. And it was an OK novel, just not one of their best efforts.T"
3,Very Disappointed,"The many pages of scripture simply appear to be a way to fill space - this book could have been included in the last one. And then the obvious plan for ANOTHER book. The authors just gave credence to the critics who said they were just dragging out an obviously profitable serier.I'm disappointed, the readers deserve better & the authors could have provided it."
1,Boring,"I read all the series books from the beginning and enjoyed them as fiction. They were not the best written books by any stretch of the imagination. But they were a fun read. This last book was dull, drawn out, and did not have nearly the pay-off it could have had. The visual images were nicely done. Other than that, it was a disappointment. I will recommend it as closure to those who have read the other books, but will preface that with a warning that it is dull and does not have the pay off that one would expect in a fictional series of 12 books."
5,Best series ever!,I have the rest of the series on paperback. This is the only one one I have done on my kindle and I love it!! Wish I got it earlier so I could read them this way too!
4,Glorious Appearing,"Undercover in enemy forces Mac goes to Jerusalem in search of Buck. Mac witnesses the cruelty of Carpathia and his followers first hand as the believers in Petra are being threatened. Rayford clings to life following an ATV accident. Chaim speaks conforting words to his audience despite the warnings of Carpathia. Miracles happen in anticipation of Christ's return.As the last book of the series my anticipation was high. It did drag a bit in the middle but by the last 150 pages or so I could not put the book down. I did enjoy how the authors tied up some loose ends but did seem to leave the door open for more that could follow. The suspense was well crafted and the scene realistic. I was inspired and will seek out more from these authors. As with the books in the series prior to this one, Glorious Appearing did challenge me in my faith and I did enjoy reading the series and having an opportunity to get to know each character. I would recommend this book! Very well done!"
4,Finally!,"This twelfth book in the best-selling Left Behind starts with the lament and cries of many with the mark of the Beast, for ""All is Lost""; connections to New Babylon, food and water, everything depending on maintaining of life has disintegrated. Carpathia, with knowledge of everyone's despondency, then pull the plug on any computer or television connection worldwide. Carpathia meets up with his lord Lucifer and grovels at his every demand. Suddenly, Heaven opens, and on a white horse sits Jesus, the Christ, the Son of the living God. Evil attempts to flee the holiness of God, and those with God's mark finally get to watch the show. As the Victor defeats evil, all Trib Force and Remnant can do is to praise and worship their Glorious King.This was a book I reviewed for Tyndale House Publishers."
3,Glorious Appearing,"Oh, finally! I don't think there's another book at the ending of a series that brings such relief and satisfaction as Glorious Appearing. It's down to the wire during the last days of the Tribulation. By the last few chapters of the book the characters are seriously dying on every other page (but I can't spoil it for you and say who makes it and who doesn't!) Part of you is like ""nooooooooo! You were so close!"" and the other part of you knows you're about to see them again at the end. This book has some wonderful reunions!"
1,Romanian Anti-Christ?,"i haven't read the series yet and probably won't given that i now know that the anti-christ happens to be romanian. i too am romanian, born in the carpathian mountains and my middle name is nicolae. i'm sure the authors didn't mean that the actual anti-christ, when he does make himself known will be from romania, but just want all the readers out there to know that there are some good nicolaes born in the carpathian mountains in romania. that's all i have to say about that. enjoy reading the books though.I do have to add, though, that I have browsed through the pages and actually found this series to be very plain and simple. For all those who like to use their brains, don't read these...however, if you want to vegitate, this is the perfect series for you."
1,Would Be Too Expensive If It Were Free!,"If you're looking for an absurd fictional account of Jesus, just read the Bible. Heck, they hand those out for free!"
5,Glorious Reading,I absolutely loved this book! It is one that can be read and re-read. It is so comforting and heartwarming.
1,What a let down!!!,"All of a sudden, the very clever and cunning devil becomes the stupid and incompetant jester for the fools court. Come on guys, you can do better than this. In this battle you don't need Jesus, someones 90 year old grandmother could beat this guy. What a real let down from the previous books. Did they write it in one day??"
2,Laborious Appearing,"FINALLY, after 11 books of mind-numbingly bad writing, I have completed the books.I honestly don't know what to give this book. One of the things I liked the most about it was consisteny, and self-fulfillment. One of things I didn't like was putting words into Christ's mouth -- dat ain't right.I'm basically reviewing all the books this last one, and I must say, Mr. Jenkins needs a dang thesaurus, I thought I'd kill myself if I read the word incongruous one more time, it was used like 100 times in the book.I don't think the premise of these books makes sense. I decided to read a counterpoint after finishing, so I read ""The Rapture Expose"" by Rossing, and it totally debunked the whole dispensationlist viewpoint (left behind premise). Check it out before you blindly buy into the holy hype."
1,Worst of the series,I'm not a Christian but I loved these left behind books until I read this one. If I wanted to be preached to I would go to church!
1,Weak ending to good series,"I think all the other books carry the story well, but this books seems to run out of things to talk about. Because of the way the endtimes are, there is barely any conflict in this novel."
4,It doesn't get better than this!,"The final installment in Left Behind has indeed saved the best for last. The attention to detail in the story is such that it could be used as a bible study on the end-times.Worship permeates the pages from chapter 11 onwards & this worship intensifies from chapter 16 onwards.A new sense of the presence of Christ was manifested after reading this book.It is worth picking up & reading - in the end, we win!"
3,Glorious Appearing,"I love the first few books in this series especially, and I have continued to read each new book with more or less pleasure, although the last few (this one included) have not been on par with the first few. I may not agree with all the theology in these books, for example, I don't believe there will be a Rapture (although I do believe in Judgment Day), but that doesn't matter because I take their novels as fiction anyway. And the underlying point is that there are many interesting characters, ideas, and qualities about this series that I really enjoy. In the same way that Francine Rivers writes about Biblical themes set in the ancient world, Lahaye & Jenkins write about the End Times of the world from their interpretation of scripture fused with their fine fictional storytelling talents.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
2,Why is most Christian fiction so lame?,"If you're hooked on the LEFT BEHIND series, then I guess you have to read this one too. But if you'd like to read a much more intelligent book on the subject, I recommend THE EZEKIEL OPTION by Joel C. Rosenberg or the books of THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY by James BeauSeigneur."
3,Series limps to the finish line,"It's probably inevitable that the 12th of a 12-book series ties up a lot of loose ends, concerning both plot and character. Some interesting images and thoughts here, but not very compelling."
1,"Anti-Catholic, fundamentalist propaganda disguised as novel","Don't buy it. To suggest that the only true ""Christians"" are fundamentalists is not only untrue, it is contrary to Christ's teachings. Books like this that thinly veil the author's biases only serve to create an unnecessary divide between people of all faiths, regardless of their vehicle for practicing that faith."
1,"Remember, it's fiction","Given Mr. LaHaye's associations with Rev. Sun Myung Moon and the Unification Church, it is difficult to accept his peculiar interpretations of Biblical prophecy as credible."
1,Disappointing,"I read the entire series in a little over a month and thought the 11th book was headed down hill in it's ability to hold my attention. Hoping for a real bang in book #12 I was sorely disappointed. It was just plain boring....unlike what the real Glorious Appearing will be like. This book just stunk. I sure wish it had continued with the same magnitude as the previous 10 books. Of course if you've come this far in the series, you have to finish it and will see what I mean!"
1,This book is an embarrassment,"I'm sorry, but after reading a few pages of this book, it is apparent that the authors are merely cloaking their brand of racial and ethnic intolerance as pseudo-pious narrative.The book's depicitons of violence and bloodshed are shocking to say the least. Far worse are the predications of violence based on differences in faith.Christianity teaches to ""love thy neighbor,"" yet the story we have in this book says that if your neighbor is of a different religion or ethnicity, then they will die an agonizing death at the hands of the Messiah. This is not why God made us all different. This is not what the United States stands for.I seriously question the authors' intent in writing this piece. Also at question are the hearts and minds of those who blindly accept this dribble."
1,glorious appearing,"I have read all of the books in the series and each book grew successively more tedious. This was definitely the worst of the bunch. This book was so boring I ended up just skimming it. Since I had invested so much energy into the series, I was interested to see how the reunion with all the loved ones would play out....wow was it so totally not worth it. The characters turned into bland, one-dimensional caricatures...wooden dialogue repeated over and over and over. None of the interesting questions were answered, such as how would Ray live with his two wives, etc....all of that was glossed over with ""only Jesus matters now""....how lame is that?THIS BOOK SUCKED EGGS."
1,Much too preachy for my taste...,"I'm a big fan of this series. I am not, however, a big fan of this book. I found it to be long-winded and boring, not to mention anti-climactic. Maybe that's because I don't consider myself to be a religious person. When my step-son urged me to read the first book, I couldn't stop reading. My step-son liked them for the fast-paced action and excitement (he was 13 at the time). I liked them because they got me thinking about God, theology, and where I am in my life. The series had been out for a few years, so I had some catching up to do. I read the first 4 or 5 in succession and eagerly awaited the following publications. But with each new novel, I found them to be less dramatic, more unbelievable and a lot more sanctimonious. Thank God that was the last book of the series!"
3,"It's an album, Amazon","Solid electronica, given freshness by Milky Globe's (Jon Tye) collaboration with different musicians on each track. Some of these include James Holden (the excellent opener Sun Spots), Isan (who cover Blondie's Fade Away and Radiate in the expected spacey manner), Luke Vibert, and Nathan Fake. Nothing truly memorable, but a good 3.5 stars."
1,THIS DK BOOK IS VERY BORING,THIS WAS THE WORST DK BOOK I EVER READ THE ONLY GOODPART WAS IGNEOUS ROCKS.I LIKE THE OTHER DK BOOKS BETTERTHAN THIS ONE[...]
2,rocks & gems,The book was not in very good condition. Binder was in bad condition and pages were torn.
2,Great info but!!,Great info but nor very interesting for kids - wanted something with better idenification pictures
5,This will be a great gift for my son.,This will be a great gift for my son. It has lots of information and great colored pictures.He will love it.
4,rock book,My grand daughter loves rock collecting and really likes the pictures and information in this book. She was visiting this summer and we checked the book out at the public library. She wanted me to buy it so we found it on line and purchased it. We had good service from the vendor and she is enjoying having the book in her home library.
5,Memorable,"Absolutely unforgettable horse. May seem far fetched but there are actually horses that are this smart and this cantankerous. Horses are as individual as humans, never doubt."
4,Guide to Agents: a Must have,Guide to Literary Agents is a must have for any writer. It has pages of information that will tell any budding author where to find agents for their work. I suggest you carefully read the TIPS and the sections on what they want before you send anything.
5,Writing a book? Then you better have this book!!!,"I have written and published books, and I have a literary agent in New York City. But I keep the Guide to Literary Agents on my desk right by my computer. This book is such an essential source of information for new writers as well as for published writers.Not only is there an enormous listing of literary agents (including contact information, preferred genres, recent books they've sold, terms, etc.), there is also a nice listing of publicists, conferences you might attend, and some concise informtion on sending your query letters.You need this book -- don't write your first book until you have used this book!!Stuart Gustafson, Authorwww.stuartgustafson.com2007 Guide to Literary AgentsQuestions To Bring You Closer To DadParables for Life in the 21st Century"
2,"Same Old, Same Old","This is probably the third edition of this book that I've purchased, and I finally figured out that the book can't possibly list all the serious and competent literary agents. By the time you winnow the list down to the few who might be interested, based on their profiles, the list gets mighty thin. After trying several (for a few novels over the years) I finally decided to self-publish a very small quantity of books and treat my writing as a hobby. I'm much happier doing this than trying to deal with a publishing establishment that seems to change little from year to year. So I think the main problem this guide suffers from is simply lack of completeness."
2,Save your cash,"Honestly, very few of the agents in this book will even read your work. Thanks to this book, they each receive tons of submissions and can't possibly read them. If you must try it anyway, check your library first."
4,Excellent reappraisal of the subject...,"Considering that this is a scholarly publication, I found it to be a surprisingly smooth read. The author has delved deeply into the maelstrom of Irish and Latin texts that make up the source material, resulting in a fresh and sometimes penetrating analysis of the state of holy women of various sorts in the church of Ireland circa 450-1150. However, this book is not for the impatient, the argument can sometimes take some time to build; be patient though. While most passages from the sources are provided in english translation, a knowledge of Latin would be helpful for the numerous short bits that are left untranslated (so I was fine), but this is not crucial for following the argument. Typos do appear from time to time in the text. If this ever came out in an affordable paperback I would definately be tempted to buy it instead of merely checking it out of my college library."
4,Pretty darn nice projector,"When I plugged it into the wall and into my computer (an iBook), it worked instantly. Genuine plug and play. The menu controls, while intuitive, are a little difficult to navigate. I may have to look at the manual. The focus is sharp; the zoom, while a little limited to suit me, works easily. I plan to love using it. The first time was wonderful. I really recommend it!"
4,"Canon Bag, Batteryand UV Filter Accessory Set for Rebel XT","The bag is nice and just right for my Canon Rebel XT. It has a lot of space for my lenses, batteries, flash and other accessories."
5,Great Kit! Worth the Price!,"I got this kit about a month ago with my Canon EOS XTi, and i have to say it's a great deal. Every item on this kit is worth the price. The bag is really nice, you can carry every thing in it, though it can get heavy after carring it for a while it's still a good bag, very resistent to any conditions, including water! The battery and the filter are, with no doubt at all, a must have accessory for you camera."
2,Not impressed,I had high hopes for this camera bag especially since it would have the Canon logo but the plastic zippers were no match for other Sony bags I currently use. I was very diappointed in the design and unbalanced storage slots.
2,It's a nice case but...,If you are looking for something lightweight and small this isn't the bag. It's huge! I does have tons of configurable slots to put a lot of things in.
2,Not Bad,"i thought its a good deal while i was in need for the extra batt and nothing more... but when i got them the battery is fine, the bag is good quality and i like the side pockets. but the filter IS NOT FOR THE G7 as it says or should be. and it is not for the telephoto lens or even the wide lens so i dont know what to do with it other than keeping it aside till any of my friends needs it."
1,Canon carrying case,I purchased a Canon camera carrying case that came with an extra battery and UV filtering lense. The case came within a few days and is perfect for what I needed. Smooth fast transaction. Five stars
4,Canon starter kit,"Camera bag is very heavy duty, the haze filter is definitely a must, as well as the extra battery because my camera at least goes through the batter pretty fast. The bag has very good padding and lots of compartments."
4,Neceessary and useful,"Great for getting your shutterbug up and running. Spare battery packs? Carrying bag? Both quite necessary. Pick up an extra memory card, and you've got a basic set up for some really great SLR pictures."
4,Worth every penny.,Really large bag and a whole lot cheaper than buying the exact same kit at a retail store.
4,A few good projects,"My summer school program includes a lot of art projects, and this book is one of my resources for ideas. This is one of those books that although it has instructions for a number of art projects, there are just a few that I use, though repeatedly. The lessons are designed for young primary students, but many projects are open-ended, allowing for a range of skill levels. There are drawing lessons for drawing a house, bike, train, castle, landscape, etc. The lessons I have used most include one for water resist, creative construction paper insects and totem pole, a symmetrical radial design, and a repeated tile-type design. Pretty good resource for an art teacher's library."
1,A reader in North Caroliona,"This book is mostly a waste of money, unless you are looking for a run of the mill mystery. I hope these stories are not a accurate look at the Wiccan community. The main character Bast; seems to be more interested in drinking beer and wondering who her next partner is going to be than doing any kind of magic or prayer or even ritual. The only ritual in the book is so watered down so as to be all inclusive that you can't even tell that it is a Wiccan ritual. Save your mony and look else where if you are hopeing to be entertained with realistic Wiccan magick and/or religion"
2,I wasn't smart enough to enjoy this book.,"OK, I know that I didn't finish college and that I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, so this book made me feel just a tad stoopid. The author is obviously an intelligent and well educated woman. Too often I scrambled for the dictionary or encyclopedia (not that that is a bad thing, of course) when all I wanted was an amusing read.If you're kinda slow like me, try Jim Butcher's hysterical Harry Dresden series, or M.R. Sellars' intriguing Rowan Gant mysteries."
2,Yakima HullyRoller Rooftop Kayak Carrier with Straps with Strap,"I don't like the product because it is hand tightened,not wrench tightened. That means the rollers come off the boat as you are rolling it off; right when you need them, they fail. The idea is good but the final product is not what you expect."
1,did not fit,Cannot really rate. Did not fit truck! For some reason it was supposed to fit but did not. Had to return.
5,Great product,Everything about these rollers is great. Easy to put together and install on my cross bars. Holds the Kayak very secure
5,Hully Rollers,Excellent product and great design. They make putting my kayak on top of my car so easy. I highly recommend them.
1,Won't use these again,"I invested hundreds in the whole Yakima rack, these rollers, a couple of saddles and a bunch of locks, and am not happy. Using the rollers with my 12-foot SOT, they spun on the crossbars when lifting the yak up there and gouged the top of my car. I see no advantage to these over the saddles, but, then, I don't like the saddles much either. Too much installation time, and they look goofy without a yak in them. Instead I stored the rollers and saddles in my garage and now use the foam blocks on my rack. They're not perfect either, but installation is a matter of minutes, they don't damage my car, and they're cheap (unless you've already thrown money at the rollers and saddles). I don't understand all the 5-star reviews here for these rollers. Maybe for small kayaks? Even then, doesn't make sense."
3,Poorly made,"I was disappointed to find a 2.5 inch section of unsewn seam at the shoulder that I will have to fix before the robe is worn. I like the weight of the robe, but it is poorly made."
5,Georgio Moroder CD,i chose this rating because the CD arrived in a timely fashion way ahead of the expected delivery date. The CD brings back many good memories of the past and I was extremely thrilled to own a copy again. Thanks
4,nice cd.,"The service was excellent, fast and good.Even One of the track was not taken from the master tapesI heard little noise and unwanted sound in one track only, but the product is ok.I don`t understand that Giorgio moroder did care the quality of the sound on this track, any way. the seller excellent. !!"
3,Memorable Rock Music That's Timeless,"Honeymoon Suite hit the mark with their impressive debut albumwith intense, catchy tunes that the lyrics just seem to roll right off your tounge. ""New Girl Now"" ""Burning In Love""""Stay In The Light"" Are the highlights of this canadian rock classic. What differs Honeymoon Suite from other hard rock canadian acts is that their music has certain type of appealthat is never ending still to this day you can hear their music on the radio. I've also seen them in concert in Toronto a long while back it's amazing to see the same intensity they have intheir music transformed to the live show it was an unbelvableexperience. Along with other bands like Rush, Triumph, LoverboyRed Rider, Honeymoon Suite Deserves a place in the rock n rollhall of fame for making Canadian Rock Music A force to reckonwith."
5,Honeymoon Suite had a unique sound that was very appealing,"""New Girl Now"" comes from Honeymoon Suite's excellent debut LP; it wasn't until its second record, however, that the band made a name for itself: 1985's The Big Prize contained the hits ""Bad Attitude,"" ""Feel It Again,"" and ""All Along You Knew"" (with Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson). Racing After Midnight, a solid record from 1988, contained ""Lethal Weapon,"" a popular song from the hit movie of the same name. Honeymoon Suite had a unique sound that was very appealing; I'm surprised the band wasn't more successful."
5,Mc Don's Review of Small Talk,"Small talk is reminicient of the Sly of old (Just like a baby)from ""There's A Riot Goin On"". All the fine guitar picks, and mellow grooves take me back to Grant Park in Chi-Town where and when the riot took place.I was there!.I have a excellent collection of Sly's music on wax.(You're the One) by Little Sister on 45 rpm.is a favorite"
2,"Sound Quality Poor, And Funky Intro Missing","The reason I bought this expensive import was to have a perfect copy instead of having to painstakingly restore my vinyl copy on my computer using an audio restoration program (Sound Forge, etc.). But instead, I found out that the CD version of the album is full of hiss, and is ACTUALLY missing the funky breakbeat clips at the beginning of ""Time For Livin'"", which was a hip hop sample classic. I collect many classic funk pieces, and I would advise the purist to DEFINITELY get the reissue of this on vinyl, and use an audio program to get the clicks and cracks out. You will definitely get closer to the Quadrophanic quality that way."
3,pretty cool product,"Pantone Color Cue 2, Color MatchingThis is a designer's dream. You just place it over the wall color or printed piece and the pantone/ rgb/cmyk color number shows up in the window. This one works great! Takes the guessing work out of finding the right color."
4,Beautiful.,"The ring is even better in person. Very nice product, and very fast efficient delivery and exchange."
2,stokke trip trapp cushion,"I bought the Stokke Trip Trapp chair and it was excellent, but the cushion does not work for the chair. For the back of the chair I can't install it."
2,doesn't stand up for long,"my parakeet goes crazy for this toy! he wrestles it, rides it, rings the bell, and slides the beads. so when the first one would no longer stand upright after a few months, i reordered two more. both arrived damaged in that they would not stand upright. i returned those two & reordered again. all was well for a couple months then the same thing happened. if only this toy would last longer, i'd say it's the best parakeet toy ever!"
3,Plantronics Voyager 510,It was easy to setup on both Xp and Vista. But the sound quality of the mic was terrible. I used this product on Paltalk and everyone complained that they had a hard time understanding me or the voice was low and could not hear me. Only other good thing about this product was that the ear piece is comfortable. The only reason I gave it a 3 star was due to ease of setup and comfortable ear piece.
1,Over Priced & Over Rated,"I received one of these for Christmas last year and have been through 3, yes 3 warrantee replacements since. The battery wore out in 2 months on the first one, The second one would not turn on after a month and the rubber on the third one separated from the plastic on the last one and the sound quality went to h***. There will not be a fourth."
4,"NOT ""If You Care"" brand, but okay","The description for this product (Beyond Gourmet Unbleached Baking Cups) mistakenly lists the ""If You Care"" brand in its description. Amazon also offers the other brand , but they are different products.I have purchased the If You Care muffin cups, which are unbleached, chemical-free and also produce excellent results! They don't stick to muffins/cupcakes at all.However, these Beyond Gourmet muffin cups are just okay - they are nice for the environment and they keep me from scrubbing a muffin pan. They stick to food way more than the If You Care ones. The price seems reasonable, as long as you're getting free shipping.Post note: I see that the description has been edited to correct the reference to the wrong brand. Here is the link for the If You Care brand:If You Care Large Baking Cups, 60-Count Units (Pack of 24)"
1,Unbleached and unimpressive,"These seemed like a great idea, but the execution is terrible. The cups aren't uniform in size and they make your cupcakes look awful! Lots of indents in the sides of the cake. I want more options for unbleached or generally green baking stuff that is of better quality.Unimpressive."
1,disappointing,"As some of the other reviews mentioned, the muffins/cupcakes stick allot to these paper cups. I've made the same recipe a number of different ways with and without paper cups. This wasted too much of my precious baked goods, especially when I bake with grain free flours. 1/4 of my muffin went to waste. I wouldn't buy these again."
1,Overpriced!!,I ordered this product at $4.25 and just saw it at my mainstream grocery store for $1.65. I am upset at the rediculous markup and will be returning it along with other items.
2,Muffins stick a bit,"I've been usingIf You Care Unbleached Large Baking Cups, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 24)for years and love them. My grocery store was out of them for a while so I got these from Amazon. I'm less than impressed. They're better than stinky, bleached, colored cups but they stick some to the muffins. I'll go back to the If You Care brand when I use these up."
5,Gourmet unbleached backing cups,These baking cups are both user and ecologically super. They work great and I think most people have more than enough bleach in their diet so that using this papers would be a help...
3,pretty overpriced,"a set of 32 standard cups, pastel colors, will usually run you about a buck and a half at the grocery store. just keep that in mind."
2,Base unit quit working after 8 months,"I was fairly happy with the phone until the base unit quit working.The good news is that it failed before the 1-year warranty expired, so I will get a replacement for the cost of shipping the telephone to the service center.The bad news is that the quality of Panasonic's telephones seems to be dropping over time. I bought this phone to replace a KX-TG2740 which had begun to fail, but was still usable for short conversations.I doubt that I will buy another Panasonic telephone unless their quality improves significantly."
3,"Very good, except the Bluetooth communication sucks","The phone is great, and the bluetooth rings for our three cellphones very good. But when we try to talk over the phone by bluetooth to the cellphones, the voices are very garbled, there is a big problem with the voices on all three of our cellphones (two of them are expensive PDA phones, the other is a generic cellphone). Anyway, if you are happy with a nice feature of it ringing to let you know your cellphone upstairs is ringing, that is good. Just don't expect to it to be very useful with your bluetooth cellphone."
2,Bluetooth compatible phone...NOT,I have had this unit for about a month. Pana sent me a second base station because my BT Moto E815 refuses to link to the phone even though it states explicitly that the E815 is compatible. The E815 links to my laptop just fine.Pana support stinks. I called twice and two times I suffered through the rep reading the manual to me. After an hour she said to return the phone to the repair dept. I called sales and they shipped a new one right away...same problem. On the second support call they escalated the issue and no one even returned my call.If you don't want the BT/cell capability buy the 5.8gHz model because other than this issure the phone great.
4,Nicely done.,"All of the AT A GLANCE books in this series are excellent travel companions. Just enough material presented in an organized and compact manner to help you survive in an Arabic (or French, Spanish, Italian, or German) speaking country."
1,This book sucks big time.,This book teaches arabic for those who at least know a little about the alphabet. I learned by taking a class and I had this book before it and it was no help. I learned more in my two hour arabic class than trying to figure out this book that just gives you a headache.
5,Buy This One!,I loved this movie. March of the Penguins is a good moviefor young kids and adults. I would think adults would likethe movie more then kids. When the penguins were dying itwas hard for me to watch this. It brought tears to my eyes.I have never seen anything like this. Before I didn't knowanything about penguins now I do and I am happy to say that.What these poor penguins goes through for their chicks is awonder to me. I would watch this at least 7 times. Beautifulmovie too.Well worth buying.Yes you should buy it :-)
3,This movie needs a serious disclaimer re violence and sadness,"I went to this movie, thinking it was going to be all cute stuff. I was very sad when the animals were dying from the cold, baby chicks die and mothers stood over them wailing, then trying to steal another mom's chick, baby penguins being scooped up to be hauled away and eaten by large birds, and others being attacked by seals. It was a bittersweet experience for me, as an animal lover, and I was very thankful that I didn't have my tenderhearted 3 and 10 year old granddaughters with me. I would NOT allow anyone younger than about 13 to watch this movie. Sure, it's a true story of life and death, but parents need to be made aware of this before allowing their children to watch it."
3,March of the Penquins,I have seen this DvD in the movies I haven't seen it in my house. But i am sure its great.
2,Disappointing,"It is an O.K. documentary, but not a story of survival, which it's being presented as. After all, for penguins, it's the easiest way to survive. It would only become the story of survival if, all of a sudden, they found themselves in the Sahara desert."
3,I was a little cool to this one...,"I didn't love this one. I expected a sceneramic sensation. No plot, no big story. Just a beautiful film. It was lovely, but not interesting. I would not recommend this one.MC White said: Just a'iiiight!"
2,Rosebud,I didn't know what HD DVD meant. I don't have a machine that will play it and I can't return it because I opened it and I didn't save my reciept. I know that it's my mistake for not knowing that I couldn't play an HD DVD on a regular DVD playing. I wish there was a statement explaining that. If I could return I would rate it much better.
3,March of the Penguins,"This might be a hard movie to have kids sit down and watch from the beginning to the end. It is a great way to highlight an important part of the penguins life style, but kids may not totally understand what they are seeing at first. The overall movie was well done and I was totally locked into it when watching it. Parents will have to judge themselves what age their child may be ready to watch it."
5,Awesome documentary,Portrayal of the realities and love in life.The time spent watching this documentary was truly well-spent.
1,Not a blu-ray material,No offence to the Oscar winning documentary. I love the story but it was not shot in HD and they didn't even try to covert it. The picture quality is about the same as the regular DVD upconvert at its best. Huge disappointment!
5,Window on nature,I loved this movie. So did my little dog. She watches tv all the time. She loves animal movies. Shows us an animal in an entertaining and insightful way that most people aren't really familiar with . Would be great for the entire family. Nice change from all the violence that is out there.
3,And then they died...,"After hearing rave reviews of this movie, I went to it in anticpation of great things, but I came out feeling cold and depressed. Don't get me wrong, the cimetography in this movie is amazing. Morgan Freeman is a very good narrator, but even with all of that, this movie is very depressing. The penguins have such a harsh life, they starve, they freeze and then they die. It seems like every other paragraph of the narration is "" And then they died"", whether it be the babies or the full grown penguins themselves. I can say, this movie did give me a lot of respect for for all the penguins go through to live...and it made me glad to be a human with a heater and a fridge."
3,A story...,illustrated with amazing photography. But why the big deal? Some of these people must not watch the National Geographic specials.The photographers deserve the praise. The story a little weak.
1,"Warning, not appropriate for some children","This beautiful documentary went south quickly when a scene evolved of a predator bird violently attacking a baby penguin, my 11 year old daughter was actually screaming and crying. Please watch this movie before letting your child watch or you may have a very upset child on your hands. If you are looking to explain the hard reality of nature this movie is for you, if on the other hand you are expecting a fun family film you may be sadly disappointed."
2,I know Winged Migration and this is not Winged Migration,"This is a National Geographic Special, not a stunning piece of art. I bought it on the ""Winged Migration"" recommendation and was disappointed. It is nowhere near the same caliber cinematography, score, or narration. It was fascinating in the same way that any National Geographic special is fascinating, but my 3 and 5 year-olds (who love Winged Migration and Baraka, ok, ok, I let them watch Koyannisquatsi (sp?) too) were not interested, and honestly, I was also disinterested by the end. Another irritation - too much anthropomorphism - penguin chicks are not ""children"" or ""unborn children"". The thing I loved about Winged Migration is that it let you do your own anthropomorphising...if only they would have stopped the narration and let the penguins speak for themselves...."
1,March of Penguins,This is an HD DVD and is unplayable on anything but an HD player. Regular version and Blu Ray will play on almost anything. Not so with this DVD.
1,"a magnificent nature film, very moving an affecting.","March of the peguins is a wonderful stirring and engaging nature film. It has all the narrative excitement and suspense of an action adventure film, unlike so many nature films that are filled with wonderful footage. There is that but there is also the struggle of these hardy protagonists for whom we keep rooting. Great for both children and adults. Kudos to Morgan Freeman for his fine sensitive narration."
5,"good, but may not be appropriate for kids under 4","This movie had great reviews and everyone said it was ""for kids,"" so we bought a copy to watch with our 2-year-old. It is a great show, but I wasn't prepared for some of the issues it raises. Some of the death scenes they soften by saying ""fade away"" and not showing it, but it does show a mom getting eaten by a seal, an egg with a baby in it freezing, and one parent penguin viciously trying to steal another's egg/baby. My daughter hadn't been exposed to concepts like this before and I wasn't sure that this was the way I wanted to introduce them, and she definitely became frantic a couple of times, so we stopped watching and resumed only after we knew which parts to fast-forward."
5,Watching a miracle unfold.,"Wow! The March of the Penguins is a must see, life appreciating experience. This is a documentary which deserves the title ""reality"" and I am certain will become a classic that is appreciated by all who love nature. The lives of my friends, my children, my grandchildren, my great-grandchildren, and their children will all be enriched be seeing this movie. Watching these penguins do their ancient mating and nurturing rituals in such a hostile environment became an experience of witnessing something of the Holy for me."
5,Another World. . . Our World,"Watch MARCH OF THE PENGUINS and your life will never be the same. This is an emotional experience, plunging in to join the emperor penguins in a frozen, freezing world. Their sense of family, of loyalty and community is astonishing and pretty often I was tearing up. The dedicated photographers who gave up any other life to be there and make this movie possible is astonishing. We experienced all this right along with them. The emperor penguins are an incredible species and I see intelligence, bravery, dedication, talent and abilities that I never knew about before seeing this movie. Morgan Freeman, by the way, as narrator is perfect. This is not for one-time viewing, you'll want to see it again. I might say there is no plot per se, but yet there is a plot. There is a plot just as real as we have in our own lives."
2,Beautiful film - horribly boring,"A lot of people like lions and penguins. The get a little stuffed creature as a child. They read stories and watch animated films with cute, anthropomorphic versions of the real thing.Naturally, folks want to see a film about their animal heroes.The problem is that nature and reality in general tend to be both brutal and VERY boring.This is a two, almost three hour film that took over a year to film, and it feels like that. Yes, there is an impressive classical score, but it gets extremely repetitive after the first thirty minutes. All the songs sound the same.There is nothing to sugar coat when the sea lion has the penguin snack.It would have been an interesting 30 minute short, but subjecting the audience to 150 minutes of watching penguins walking and freezing ...Watch at your own peril."
5,Such an amazing film,"An amazing film, showing the brutality of nature and the perseverance of a species. Incredible movie worth watching again and again."
5,Stunning,"This movie was incredible and is a must see for anyone who cares about nature at all.The lengths that the filmakers went through to capture this footage is astounding and paid off well. It is relatively low-key and the narration adds to this sense. Nothing outrageous or over the top like you sometimes hear on various nature shows. Freeman just relays the story perfectly an the visuals of the movie carry so much.Stunning landscapes and to see the penguins and how they behave - their mating patterns, aring for their young and just the shear numbers and community all moving across the land and huddling together. Simply amazing.A powerful film that I watch from time to time and never get tired of viewing."
5,An Incredible Journey,"A great documentary about the life-cycle of the emperor penguin. An unusual ritual that shows the extreme and harsh conditions that these aquatic birds face and deal with to keep their species in existance.Morgan Freeman does an excellent job narrating the events that take place, and the film crew that actually endured these elements to capture everything these amazing creatures go through.The roller-coaster ride of highs and lows are experienced throughout this film as you witness the humor and tragedy that makes this such a great film to watch.I cannot recommend this high enough to all age groups."
5,Poor little Penguins,"Wow! I had no idea what they go through in their lives, it's very intense and sad. You have to see it to beleive it, seriously, this is a extrodinary documentary on Penguins. You will be surprized on how hard they really have it. They can survive the coldest winters in all the world in Antartica. The filming of this must have been very, very dramatic and cold. It's amazing what these guys went through, but even more amazing is what Penguins go through, its almost depressing, but very educational, interesting and warm hearted. They are so very cute as well and funny looking too. These Penguins have it rough, and us humans think we have things rough. They go months without eating, wow I would totally freak out if I haven't ate for just a few days. Poor little Penguins."
4,Nature Can Be Cruel,"This is a very worthwile documentary. You see elements of arctic life that haven't been shown before in other documentaries.But please be forewarned:You will see old penguins fall and die.You will see parents losing eggs and see the eggs freeze.You will see brand new baby penguins die.You will see young penguins get eaten by predatorsIt's rather traumatic -- as it is shows a reality of nature.If you think your kids are ready for this, then this is truly a wonderous DVD.But please take care -- your children may not be ready to see babies of any kind freeze to death. And this DVD doesn't hide the gruesome reality."
3,Them penguins sure is cute,but this was pretty underwhelming. Didn't quite add up to the compelling experience I thought it would be. Nothing to elevate it much beyond your standard Discovery channel doc.
5,I have such an easy life...,"I sometimes used to think that I have a hard life (everybody does that once in awhile). After seeing this magnificent documentary I will never feel that way again. These penguins just astounded me. That they can live for three months at a time in the middle of an Antarctic winter with temperatures of 50 below zero and lower WITH NO FOOD just boggles my mind. The documentary itself pulls no punches - not all of the penguins live through that harsh winter. One of the extra features shows how even a change in ice flows can have a huge effect on penguin populations. I have to tip my hat to the filmmakers who braved those tough conditions to make this film, too. This film is just an amazing accomplishment - very informative and entertaining at the same time."
2,A depressing documentary,"This documentary should have been shortened and been on Discovery Channel. It is NOT for children. We bought it, watched it once and will probably never watch it again. It is a gruelling and sad existance for an animal. It makes you want to rescue them and relocate them to a location more habitable. The film is enlightening, but not entertaining."
2,Borrrrring,Do yourself a favor and watch the movie for FREE by checking it out from the library BEFORE you decide to purchase it.I had read the rave reviews and heard the hype...I finally got a chance to watch the movie. The kids kept asking for something more entertaining but we kept watching thinking something magnificent would happen. Yawn. It's a documentary about penguins. It's interesting. It is not entertaining. This is NOT a movie for the kids to watch over and over again. It's not a movie that **I** ever want to see again either!
1,Could have been interesting...,"Whoever made this failed. Penguins are cool, but not in this movie.Basically pengins walk in snow. Walk in snow. Walk in snow. Sit on an egg. Die. Die. Die way too much. Why was this so boring. It could have been interesting."
2,for the birds,"Man, I have to say, this is some stunning nature photography. The shots that that French film crew got, they beggar belief!Tragically, I shut the film off about fifteen minutes before the end. I really didn't care whether the penguins froze to death or not.Sorry."
2,Don't even rent it,"Mr. Freeman's narration is the only thing that saves this from 1 star. Poor picture quality, and a minimum of information, with long periods of things happening but with no explaination or details. ""Emperor penguins endure 3 or 4 winters before having chicks, and then only one per year..."" 'How long do they live?' I asked out loud... silence...By comparison, Planet Earth has the most eye-popping cinematography I have ever seen in my life, and fascinating things are explained to you. It's 100 times more valuable and enjoyable, put your money where it counts."
4,Adorably entertaining,"While it may be nothing more than a National Geographic with a famous narrative, `March of the Penguins' still stands out above the rest mostly due to its subject matter, I mean penguins are just so freaking cute. Exploring the mating rituals of the Emperor penguins we are given some very entertaining and funny segments of film and an interesting look at the lives of some really adorable animals. I can think of a worse way to spend an evening."
4,not to be overanalyzed,"I saw a review here which takes pretension to new heights. A fellow amateur reviewer claimed this movie anthropomorphises penguins and identifies them with the American dream, asserting the ""cultural idealism"" and importance of heterosexuality. What utter pseudointellectual rubbish. The commenter's bias and agenda is pitifully transparent. This movie is to be taken for what it is. A beautifully filmed chronicle of a family of penguins. No more, no less."
5,Marvelous,"Absolutely marvelous! Loved every minute of it, with Morgan Freeman's voice narrating you can't go wrong!"
5,"Truly, a story of love","I dont know if penguins feel emotion. From the movie it seems they do. But as human beings, we certainly can feel the love and empathize with them in their fight for the survival of their species.We had(and still have) a similar struggle for survival. And who knows, by our insanity to over-populate the earth, we are already responsible for extinction of thousands of species and may be responsible for the extinction of most of the remaining species(including ourselves), even as determined a species as Emperor Penguin. I can only hope these creatures would survive the test of Man."
5,At Last! A Documentry That Isn't Boring!!!!,"This movie is so COOL!!! With great music, spactacular photography, and amazing narration, this movie will completely BLOW YOUR MIND!! This movie is NOT boring!! Even my brother (who has a very short attention span) could sit through this movie and actually enjoy it! I never knew what hrash extremes penguins had to overcome!This is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and cheer for these penguins who endure so much! And you might just want to watch this movie just to see the adorable and quite fuzzy penguin chicks!THEY ARE SO CUTE!"
3,not filmed in HD?,"Although the content of the movie was great, it was not worth buying in blu-ray as the picture was no better than DVD. Comparing to the Planet Earth episode with the penguins, the difference in picture is very obvious!"
4,"I Didn't Think I Would Like This One, but I Did","So I was over my Grandpa's house Christmas day and he had the March of the Penguins DVD sitting on the sofa. I have heard good things about it and I was already getting bored with my relatives, so I popped in the DVD. The first thing you will hear is the excellent narration by Morgan Freeman (great choice) followed by the scenery that doesn't seem real. It is so amazing how this movie was filmed without interfering with the animals. It's like your right there with them, and by the time the film is over, you really feel like you know these magnificent birds as though they were human. After viewing this film, I will never complain about having a rough life or look at a penguin the same way again. If there is such a thing as reincarnation, please God, don't have me come back as a penguin. I hate the cold!"
4,Amazing!,"How amazing God's creation is! Simply full of wonders!Besides the main movie, I enjoyed the special features as much (documentary of documentary). The ""Of penguins and men"" makes me appreciate even more how challenging and valuable it is to make this film. Great piece of work!"
5,awareness,"Important documentaries like these need to be shown in every elementary and high school. We live in a miraculous environment and the people who put this together certainly achieved an excellent portrayal of penguin life. Hopefully we will see future generations protecting what we take for granted. Even seeing it the third time, we were moved and it provoked quite a discussion among our family members.A few questions we still have like how much do they weigh when they live for the breeding ground and what is their lifespan."
3,It is worth seeing...,"...although it may gather dust in your collection.I agree that this documentary is well filmed, and with Mr. Freeman's talents, well narrated. The lives of Emperor Penguins, the struggle they go through to brood/protect their chicks, the arduous trek through the beautiful but unforgiving artic are all compelling.Although three stars seems like it's low, it is done with the thought that it is worth watching once or twice but the impact of this documentary quickly starts to diminish. In a way, since it focused specifically on one species of penguins, it limits the watchability of this film. The stark majesty of Anartica is also a bit diminished when going from the big screen to the home.In comparison, Winged Migration and most of David Attenborough's series especially Blue Planet and The Life of Birds, seems much more fulfilling over time. I would recommend renting this documentary first before deciding to buy."
4,"Beautiful, Informative, and very slow-paced","This is a well-produced and interesting documentary that is well worth watching, but it moves along very slowly in places. There are endless close-ups of penguin feathers and long-distance shots of penguins wandering across the Antarctic ice, usually heading away from the camera, while moody music plays. I really enjoyed most of it, but it could have been trimmed down to 60 minutes without hurting the narrative. Overall, I'd give this 4.5 stars if that were possible."
5,A wonderful wild life documentary,"Much of what I would like to say has already been written here. This was a wonderful nature study of the courtship, mating and ""childcare"" of the emperor penguin. The movie is enhanced by beautiful photography and nice narration by Morgan Freeman. The story itself is amazing.This movie is a good way for children to be introduced to ""the birds and the bees"" although some small children may be upset by certain sad parts. After all, this is a nature film, and nature can be harsh at times.One point I would like to add which I don't think is mentioned by other commentators here: how in the world did the director, cameramen and other people who actually filmed this movie withstand the severe weather? I am really amazed that such a movie could even be filmed by human beings given the death defying environment they had to endure."
5,March of the Penguins,I found that this was a very enjoyable movie. It also shows the harsh reality of nature and what it takes to be a penguin in Antartica. It is a movie that everyone in the family can enjoy.
4,Gorgeous and Inspiring... Is It Really a Documentary?,"This movie is beautiful, and I applaud the filmmakers for braving Antarctic conditions for a year to film it. For those of you who speak French, you may want to get the original French version of this documentary. The content of the film's narration is different than the English version; it is more poetic and dramatic, sometimes in an overdone and silly way that is entertaining in its own right.Along those lines, this film has recently been ""de-classified"" as a documentary in some circles, because of its not-very-scientific anthropomorphizing of the penguins. For example: ""They will risk starvation and attack by dangerous predators, under the harshest conditions on earth, all to find true love.""Well, do the penguins do what they do for ""true love""? It's an interesting and arguable question, but not one that's up for debate in this charming film."
1,"Boring, boring, boring long meaningless film","Do not buy this DVD. It is awful. I saw the original with a five year old this summer and we left after 3/4 of showing. Get this, you watch a line of Penquins march 70 miles from the nearest food supply, stand in the cold to mate, then female marches back 70 miles while male starves. Female eventually returns to take over the egg and male leaves to hopefully march 70 miles to food in the ocean. Boring film, no action, no interest. Do not take children."
5,Love Story,"March of the Penguins vindicates cinema, a medium that has become vicious and destructive. March of the Penguins is almost holy, almost transcendent. It is the most beautiful portrayal of true love I have seen, and is perhaps the most beautiful portrayal of true love ever filmed, a Pieta for a cynical generation."
5,March of the Penguins - a movie for all ages,"Before I saw this movie, I thought it would be boring but it was just the opposite. My 10 year old daughter and I watched it together and were both fascinated by the emporer penguins.I was surprised at how intelligent the penguins are and all the challenges that they must overcome to survive. This was an educational and inspirational movie!! I would recommend this movie to all ages!"
3,"Sentimental anthropomorphism, but astonishing footage","I know mine is a minority view, but I found the editing, score and narration-all of which were designed to make the human viewer identify with and root for the struggling penguins-to be rather sappy, and to undermine the power of the amazing footage of these remote creatures. The fact that they walk on two feet lends to easy anthropomorphism, and the filmmakers push that at every opportunity. Make no mistake-the images are remarkable, as are the facts of the penguin mating march. I just wish that the filmmakers didn't feel it necessary to dress it up as a human love story."
4,A Love Story,"Luc Jacquet 'March of the Penguins' takes us into the lifes of the emperor penguins of Antarctica. For one year we share their struggle to survive their devotion to each other. A year of sacrifice,suffering,challenging the elements in one of the harshness places on earth and finally of triumph. This flim teachs us an important fact of life. Even with all the hardtimes,the sadtimes and the setbacks life still finds a way to survive. The photography of the film is beautiful. Antarctica is indeed a beautiful place. But the penguins can have it,it's just to cold for me. Not since the movie 'Babe' {the one about the pig} have I enjoyed a movie about amimals so much. March of the Penguins is a touching movie. Maybe one day some humans will be as devoted and loving to each other and to their offspring as the penguins are to theirs. As I write this review it's near the end of February. And in a few days or weeks from now the penguins will be on the march again. I wish them a successful journey."
5,Almost Too Amazing To Describe,"This documentary showing what a group of penguins goes through on a yearly basis in Antarctica is almost too unbelievable to express in words. To use the cliché, you have to see this to believe it.When I saw it, I remember almost being stunned afterward at what I had just seen, and then thinking about it for a few days afterward, which is not something I usually do. It was just a haunting, unbelievable story....and 100 percent true, not one of these ""based on a true story"" fiascoes.The hardships that these flightless birds endure to keep their species going is almost impossible to believe. I have yet to hear a friend say anything less about this than I just said: all of them were amazed."
1,Don't believe the hype,"After all the media attention and box office, I expected so much more. Although I am sure that the mind-numbing tedium is supposed to reflect the mind-numbing tedium experienced by the penguins, I had to say for myself, ""Do I really need all of this mind-numbing tedium?"" While there were some amazing images, the ""story"" could have been told much more interestingly in MUCH MUCH MUCH less time. I really believe this was sold on the cuteness of the chicks, which gets old after the thousandth shot."
3,Penguins Are Cool,"This really is a remarkable DVD and you learn a great deal about penguins. However, here is my gripe. About every 10-15 minutes they show a Penguin dying. However, the baby penguins are pretty cute and fun to watch (except for when they are dying). This DVD may or may not be your cup of tea."
3,DO NOT let children under 12 watch this!!,"As an adult, I enjoyed the movie. Informative, moving, sad... really, really sad... but beautifully filmed and narrated. I would, however, NOT allow a child (especially a child with a sensitive nature) watch this film. It's heart wrenching and you'll have a lot of explaining to do. So, unless you want to have to explain the harsh reality of death and loss to your five-year-old, I don't recommend viewing it with him (or her)... now matter HOW much they beg!"
2,video transfer quality was not optimal,"This well-narrated DVD covers an amazing story that most viewers will find compelling and is already well-described by previous reviewers. However, I was very disappointed at the poor quality video transfer. This exceptionally difficult filming project shows some of the most spectacular and inhospitable scenery in the world. So why wasn't a higher resolution technology used for the transfer?! It does this tremendous project a grave disservice."
2,MARCH OF THE PENGUINS,"I enjoyed this DVD, the story was well told and the scenery was spectaular. I found the DVD to be very educational. I recommend it for all."
2,Save Your Money - Watch Discovery Channel,"Why is everyone so in love with this documentary? Have that many people never watched Discovery Channel or Animal Planet? There is nothing terribly new presented here. The penguins are cute and all, but cute only gets you so far.I'm not saying this documentary is bad, it's just not that different from any of the other hundreds of animal documentaries shown on your TV every day."
4,Regarding: >>>>> Reviewer: Patrick L. Murphy (Virginia),"What a long, long, long, boring, meaningless life (Patrick L. Murphy) ""reviewer"" must have."
3,"Great movie, disappointing DVD","I will say nothing poorly of the American version of the movie, as if that were the only version existing, it would get five stars. The extras on the DVD are certainly well worth checking out as well.However, there is a serious problem with this DVD, which no one seems to have noticed. It does NOT have the French version of the audio.There are two versions of this film, with (I believe) the same footage. There is the documentary-style, as read by Morgan Freeman, which is what this DVD incorporates, and there is a more story-style version, that is the original French version. It seems a very poor choice not to put the French audio onto the disc as well, I'm sure they would have had the room for it.In any case, I consider this a half-completed DVD, and hence it receives a half-completed five stars, rounded up just because the American version is certainly nothing to ignore."
1,National Geographic Quality,"I was missled by this show. I felt the hype and previews were promoting a program my child would enjoy. It was enjoyable for about 15 minutes, then my child and myself became very dis-interested. This is simply a documentary on penguins. Nothing more. It is more of an educational film, rather than an entertainment film."
5,One of the best movies of all time,"Pretty much like a documentary film, but more thoughtful and moving than most drama movies I have watched lately. I would definitely give this to my fiance in the future!"
5,A Very Well-Done Documentary!,This movie is actually a documentary about the lives and migration patterns of emperor penguins in Antarctica. It is very interesting and wholesome and appropriate for all family members...
4,Nature Is Not Cute,"I purchased and viewed ""March"" from Amazon several years ago, but haven't reviewed the movie until now. Seeing it appear on the Amazon Instant Video selection, I re-read some of the reviews posted here and decided to leave my own comment. First of all, it is Excellent. It has already been emphasized by a few, but let me restate that this movie isn't ""cute"" as some have written. Yes, there are some cute scenes, but it is misleading, I believe, that it be labeled as cute, since it is really a story of survival and not children's entertainment in the classic sense. But the portrayal of the raw brutality of nature in the one of the most harsh environments on Earth is among the best in the documentary genre. Very educational, very well filmed and narrated. Just not cute. And one final comment: If there was ever proof on film that members of the animal kingdom (besides mankind) have the ability to Love, it is documented in March of the Penguins."
5,Penguins On Ice,This movie was one of the most interesting documentaries I've ever watched. I believe the film directors on this one really took the time and patience needed to film a very delicate animal. It was beautiful and sad at the same time. But I think everyone should watch this film for the pure education factor of it. It would be a wonderful education piece to use in the national school system.
3,The french version,"This movie make me cry, I saw the french version and wanted to buy, but I didnt know that the English version would be so different. Even the music is different! Try the original version! Its totally different!"
4,Old favorites,Well done renditions of old favorites by established artists. These are gospels that everyone is familiar with and can sing along with them. Its a feel good experience.
5,Absolutely Great Album,Brenda Lee your the best - after going to your concert at Busch Gardens I purchased this album you spoke about. Even my grandchildren love it.
2,Not Standard Size,"I ordered the female mate to this, only to discover that it is not the standard 5/8"" garden hose quick connect, but rather the 3/4"" size for pumps. Otherwise, it looked good."
1,Useless book alert!,"Pick another book like Serway's, or Tipler's, or even Modern Atomic and Nuclear Physics, for a legitimate introduction to this subject. Beiser's lazy treatment of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the Bohr atom amounts to little more than throwing out a few formulas and examples. The same goes for the transformations in special relativity - Tipler's treatment is superior. Even the Schaum's book in modern physics is better on this topic. His treatment of quantum mechanics was obviously meant to be ignored - hence the leaving out of important conceptual and explanatory material that, say, Modern Atomic and Nuclear Physics puts in. Overall, it is worthless in comparison to the previously mentioned books."
3,"Not bad, some key aspects lacking","At first I thought this book was very good and very well explained. Then I realised that sometimes he doesn't tell us the whole story, leaving out certain calculations and stuff. First year textbooks are known to do this, but looking back at my first year textbooks, I found them to be more ""complete"". It is a good starter book for Modern Physics, however, after that you will need something thicker."
3,Like most,The book is not very good with the equations in it. It needs to be more consistant with variable letter names. Some equations in the proofs cannot be used to answer end of chapter questions. This gets confusing.
4,The Crow Takes A Meandering Path,"The Way the Crow Flies was not, in my opinion, as good as the author's previous book, Fall on Your Knees. Fall On Your Knees is one of my favorite books of all time. I loved it for the unique voice, for the deep and alive characters, for the redemption and beauty of the whole awful story. I think this book is quite good but it lacks the sharpness and focus of MacDonald's previous book. The story itself is plenty grim, as was the story line of Fall On Your Knees. This story however, seems to go on and on and on, with endless details that at times become somewhat tedious. The effect of all this detail is that it watered down the tonality and intensity of the story. Still, its virtues far outway its shortcomings, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves excellent writing and doesn't mind a rather long ""noir"" look back at the 60's."
1,A Real Let Down,"I hate to be a dissenter in this otherwise mostly postive group of reviewers, but this book disappointed me miserably. My litmus test for any book is 50 pages. If it hasn't grabbed me by then it's probably not going to, and since I always have plenty of other books waiting to be read I put it aside and move on. ""The Way the Crow Flies"" didn't even make it past page 40. I was SO bored I could hardly stay awake. I admit it had promise. The post-World War II setting drew me, as I grew up in the 50s and 60s myself. For some reason I took an instant dislike to Mimi, the mother. All the endless detail involved in driving onto the base and Jack moving into his office, all the background of his days as a pilot I found incredibly tedious.I realize many great books start slowly and build into something wonderful (example: ""...And Ladies of the Club"" by Helen Hooven Santmyer) and this book may very well be one of them.Bottom line: I just didn't have the patience to find out."
3,Laborious Read!,"I'm not sure what all they hype about this book was, but I found it a laborious read. After the first 200 pages, I kept thinking maybe it would get better. Then after 500 pages it was just a quest to finish. The French was distracting to me and could have been left out since I had no idea what it meant. Being a child of the 60's myself, I found the setting and time interesting since i lived through the Cuban Missle Crisis era. The characters could have been interesting but I never felt attached to any of them including Madeline."
2,trite and hackneyed,"I found this book rather amateurish with tiresome cliches, boring stereotypes and a rather unimaginative, trite story line. Predictable and at times Ms. MacDoanld stretches the boundaries of belief. I understand that the author was attempting to contast the stark dichotomies of the pristine, hermetical family with the harsh, crass evil in the world, but please, the writing is so unseasoned that it detracts from any ""message,"" from whatever the point of the novel is attempting to make. Ms. MacDonald's""poetic license""was irritating, using one word sentences, incomplete sentences and a mish mash of popular songs of the day. I wanted to find something to keep me going after spending $29, and in the end it was only with the thought that I might be able to recoup some of back by selling it to a used bookstore. There are too many other credible pieces of literature to enjoy than to waste time on this one."
3,Almost quit reading half way through...,"Halfway through this book I got a fever and was in bed for several days. The disturbing content of this book swirled around in my head, unwelcome, and I was considering not finishing the book because the content was so dark. Hoping I had hit the bottom and the story would climb out of the hole, I continued on and while the last half of the book was not light, the resolution was as satisfactory as one could hope for given the plot. Books I enjoyed more this year: The Ha Ha, The Timetraveler's Wife, and The Kiterunner."
3,Beware: editor on vacation,"After reading ""Fall On Your Knees"" I couldn't WAIT for MacDonald to write another book. When I saw ""The Way the Crow Flies"" (all 800 pages) I was thrilled! The thrill quickly turned to disappointment as I trudged through page after page after page. Where was the editor???? This book was filled with so much unnecessary writing that after awhile I began to feel like MacDonald was just in love with her own writing. The story could have been so much more compelling if she had stayed focused on it, instead of including every bit of trivia of the era,(Donald Katz she's not) every breath, every gust of wind etc. I would read pages and pages and wondered what possible reason this was allowed in by an editor. 800 pages? Ridiculous. I couldn't wait for it to end. I was very disappointed in MacDonald's novel and if I hadn't known what an outstanding author she is, (Fall on Your Knees) I never would have finished it."
2,Beautiful writing but excessive & depressing,"I was very hopeful when starting this novel, however I agree with the Amazon.ca & Books Canada reviews. I love the descriptions and the flow of the writing. Unfortunately, Ms. Macdonald tries to include too many details and the last 150 pages are difficult to finish and more horrific than necessary.It has the feeling that things just aren't horrible enough and every gruesome detail needs to be revealed and forced upon you.I felt depressed by the overly sunny beginning to the completely shattered ending. No light is left glowing. The description of the murder was excessive & not truly believable. The description of the lead character's adult life was monotonous.There is something to the saying ""Less is more""."
5,Listen to the children,"This is the first book I have read by Ann-Marie MacDonald and it was a gripper. It is not so much a suspense story of what will happen as it is when will the adults finally find out about what goes on after 3 in their daughters' classroom. It is upsetting to understand that parents, even attentive good parents, won't necessarily discover that their child is being abused.This is the kind of novel that I found myself telling people about as I was reading it. From the ethics of using Nazi scientists to build the space program, to the rush to judgement in crime investigations, to the relationships of husbands and wives; discussions could range far and wide in the context of this book. I was unsettled the whole time I was reading it and this is not a book I will soon forget."
5,This is a great novel,"I was fascinated by the pace and the atmosphere and the characters in this novel. It may be the ""Great Canadian Novel"". I am about the same generation as the main character and was able to relate very well to her. Do yourself a favour: read this book."
4,Overwhelmed,"Ann-Marie MacDonald is a genius. The plot was like an intricate tapestry, jumping ahead and then catching up. I found it too gripping emotionally; more than I could handle. The darkness of the story invaded me and I couldn't let it go. It takes a genius to do that."
2,starts out slow,"Could not keep my interest. Starts out slow, boring,to much discription not enough story. I read fall on your knees and that was a good book."
2,ONLY FOR THE SNOWED IN,"I read many a novel, but this one takes the cake. I do not recommend it, nor do I think I will finish it! However, being the avid ready I am I plan to complete it before the end of Winter 2009."
2,dickensonian in it's overwriting,"I almost gave up numerous times while reading this book. It is about 200 pages too long. But I kept thinking it had to pick up, and I REALLY wanted to know what happened. Then it suddenly got worse and made little sense. But I kept plugging and chugging through. I almost wish I had stopped when the feeling first hit me. I rarely put a book down before finishing it but this one would have been a good choice for that distinction. The story is great but you have to read through lots and lots of unnecessary description of stuff. I know the writer was trying to create the atmosphere but the result with me was just lots of yawns."
2,are there no fact-checkers in canada?,"while the book is well-written, and the story well-plotted, it drove me absolutely round the bend every time yet another anachronistic pop culture reference reared its ugly smirking head. muttley did not snicker in 1962. joan rivers was not on carson in 1962. it's the little things that make or break a great book, and this one broke."
5,Wonderful,"This is simply one of the best books I have read in a very long time. The way in which MacDonald evokes the innocence of early 60's domestic life in Canada and then shatters that image is stunning. On one level, this is a mystery and another, it is an insightful examination of the destructive power of lies. A truly great read."
3,Loved it - Hated it,"This is an interesting book, I have to say that I did enjoy reading most of it but there were times, at least a half dozen, when I wanted to toss the book aside - it seemed to get so far off course that I was no longer interested but in the end, it all came together.The first 100 pages are a real chore to read & there are at least another hundred later in the book that were difficult to maintain my interest. But I am glad I finished it, mostly because I felt I had invested too much time in it to just let it go.I don't know if I would really recommend it. The writing was good; the story was interesting but it just seemed a few hundred pages too long. & I don't think the ending was plausible at all but it was surprising."
2,Couldn't get into it,"I loved Ann-Marie MacDonald's debut, Fall on Your Knees. I was so excited about reading The Way The Crow Flies. What a disappointment. I gave it my ""100-page effort"" and gave up on page 101. Nothing about this book intrigued me. I didn't care about the characters. The enticing opening blurb about a girl's death wasn't enticement enough to keep reading.I had so hoped that this would be a great book, but I simply didn't care for it."
4,Disturbing but well-worth the read ...,"I waited many years to read MacDonald's second novel and it was worth the wait.And incredibly disturbing book to read with difficult and sensitive subject matter, but MacDonald weaves an astonishing story populated by memorable and vivid characters.The only reason why this didn't get a 5-star rating from me is that I found the story slowed down when we re-encounter Madelaine as an adult. One minor flaw is an otherwise haunting story.I just hope I don't have to wait another 6 years for her third novel!"
3,The Way...,"Totally wish I would have never read this book. There were so many parts that could have been left out and it would have been a GREAT book. I liked a lot of it, but the parts that were bad were SO bad I had to skip over them. It's kind of like a soap opera...you could skip a few parts and still know what is going on!"
4,"Good book, long read","This book was very well written, but i had trouble getting through it. The book switched pointes of view between the 8 year old daughter and the father and i found that i loved reading the girl's perspective over the father's. I found all the conversations about the war and war crimes to be kind of boring and at times found myself skipping whole paragraphs.The book changes time periods towards the end and tells the story of the girl 20 years later. It was interesting to see how everything had changed.The ending was very unsuspecting as well.Overall it was a good book, long, but good."
5,MMO to be remembered,"I've been playing Anarchy Online for two years now and this game is the greatest MMORPG I have ever played, and basically the best game I will ever play.All of the expansions to this game are phenominal, Shadowlands was a breakthrough to this game.. and now there is Alien Invasion!Being able to build your own cities is an amazing idea for this game, and aliens being to invade is awesome.We got new items, creatures, quests, zones, and everything in between with this expansion. This expansion is worth the money, it doesnt cost much but it will add-on to your experience in the game, whether you are new or a veteran to this game."
4,"Occasionally uneven, but some fantastically funny parts.","Actually, I'm one of the authors in the anthology - Cait Glasson, ""Paul's Letters to the Lesbians"" - and so I'll only talk about the others' stories. The anthology is uneven in places - some stories, while extremely good pastiches, are not tremendously funny, although perhaps if I were more of a fan of the parodied authors I'd think differently - but contains some extremely funny material as well. Some that stick out in my mind, for instance, would include R.E.Neu's ""Heather Has a Mommy and a Daddy"", which is absolutely priceless, while Shelly Rafferty's ""Rejection Letter"" is a cruelly accurate skewer of the queer small-press industry.Worth picking up for those two alone, there are some other real gems hidden in this one. And I purposely do not include my own in that; I'll leave reviewing that to someone with a little less at stake."
5,The best book ever!,"Amazingly inspirational, tugged on my heartstrings, and made me cry, laugh, and then I cried again. I have never before read a book that has touched me this much. I was left spellbound at times by the author's incredible ability to express each individual characters' emotions. I felt like I knew these people, and like I was living my life vicariously through them. This book shows the struggles and journey of one young girl, but it reflects the journey that each one of us goes on. Humor and drama, comedy and romance, action and horror were all woven together to create an exciting plot with multiple surprises that I had not seen coming. But each one taught a meaningful lesson. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, especially if you have almost given up on reading entirely, because this book will restore your faith in new cutting-edge fictional literature."
1,cant compare to The Bloomsbury Reveiw and other serious reviews,"The reviewers in this magazine sometimes hit the mark and write with style and insight, but also there are many shallow and cheap shot reviews that are very anemic wanna-be's of true cultural wits like Mencken and Updike. Some of the reviewers suppositions sound as though they are grad student interns, and havent yet lived long in the field of writing to form seasoned viewpoints that are supportable. I'd pass on this superficial pop culture mag, and save your money to buy books that nourish you."
5,great magazine!,This will be a great resource for me as I love to read and also facilitate a bookgroup. I love it!
2,"Too general, too predictable","If you are fond of books, bookmarks magazine collects reviews from all major newspapers and magazines and compiles them for you. This might sound good, but unless you live under a rock, you've probably already seen the reviews. They only cover books that are already well publicized, so there's not much of a chance of learning about a more obscure title. Instead, you'll see numerous reviews of NY Times bestsellers, which becomes redundant. There are no surprises. In fact, Bookmarks is very similar to the newspaper style collection Book Pages found free at most libraries.For example, Freedom was heavily covered in Bookmarks, as well as everywhere else. But many other new titles, some much better IMHO were published at the same time. If you'd like to read about those, you have to dig deeper. The London Review of Books and/or The New York Review of Books are better values, as is The New Yorker magazine for variety."
4,Great for book lovers,"Bookmark magazine is a great book review magazine. But not only are the reviews well written and insightful, there are usually very informative articles about various authors, both current and from years past. I particularly like the reviews because you get a cross section of what other reviewers have said about a book, in addition to the Bookmark review.My only concern is that Bookmark should be a monthly magazine. At times, by the time you get to read a review of a book, it has been out for several weeks already.Having said that, I still subscribe to this wonderful review of books and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves books."
2,very short.....fluff interview,There are much better interviews...the 1 hour which you can download for free from a year ago with Charlie Rose is stunning ...this is about 8 minutes and your typical fluff piece..with John Stossel asking a few questions ..nothing too deep.SAVE your $10 and buy the Charlie Rose DVD or better yet get it for free
4,Stuart,"Honeymoon Suite went from an AOR band to a Hard/melodic Rock band with this cd. It also came out in 1991 which means grunge killed it's hopes. But, there are some noteworthy tracks: Bring On The Light, How Long, The Road & Stand Alone. Overall it is good but it's no Big Prize."
4,very cool retro soul funk,I love the album. These guys would have been one of my favs if I was around in the early 70's. They are a great funk/soul band and sharon's got some spunk.
5,Butterflies in my stomach ))),"I adore Un Jardin En Mediterranee by Hermes. I bought this perfume when I have been to Greece for the first time. Since then when I wear Un Jardin I feel the breathe of sea, light of sunrays and scent of Mediterranean flowers. Fresh bergamot breeze and spray of juicy mandarin are replaced by the bright play of floral notes, honey sweet of figs is set off by slight bitterness of juniper, cedar and cool tranquility of cypress. Un Jardin En Mediterranee by Hermes is something unique, it makes people turn around. It is smell of confidence and tenderness. The perfume is pertinent for business meeting and first date, it suits for day or evening. It possesses by mysterious magnetism, I love every drop of this bouquet, highly recommend!"
4,Great for arthritis.,"I have some early onset arthritis, mostly in my hands and it was affecting my guitar playing, not that anyone would notice ;-) This exerciser has been a big help in reducing the stiffness in my fingers, and engendered strength in them which has benefited my playing. For the low cost I would recommend it to anyone with hand problems."
3,Gripmaster Medium Tension,"Gripmaster Hand Exerciser Red, Medium Tension (7-Pounds per Finger)I bought this with the callous builders. Although a few people mentioned that the builders were helpful inside a week, I haven't seen it. They do toughen up the skin on you fingers but not like rocks. I suggest doing reps, 20-80 depending on your strength and tenderness, only a few times every other 2-3 days. Doing excessive repetitions can lead to Carpal tunnel. It's s good tool for strength training but again use sparingly."
5,this is one of the best songs i have heard!,"I simply love this song it really expresses the feeling of a broken heart. Sometimes if i'am feeling sad I will listen to his song. It just soothes me, and bet it does the same to all he others who listen to this song."
3,Works for me but......,As other reviewers have pointed out the magnet on this timer is next to useless. I have each side set to time one thing I do everyday and it works fine for that. I don't have to handle it that often so it is less likely to fall off the frig. I dislike the limited alarm time. I believe it is only 15 seconds. The older times by this maker would sound for a full minute. I use it but I wish they still made the old three-in-one timer made in the USA.

4,"wonderful pictures, great for children!","this book is great. and in response to someones comment that the author told half-truths, I think she was trying to simplify a culture that is complex in order to gain the interest of children. authors do this all the time, and although it can seem bad or that they are not telling the truth about the culture, they do this in order to open the childrens eyes to a different world. plus, the author spelled Kuna with a ""C"", like Cuna, because when she wrote it, that was the preffered spelling. The C and K are interchangeable and the opinon of the preffered spelling has changed throughout the years. So give the girl some credit"
4,"Been there, done that","Nothing special on this one, but it is a different scenario, so worth getting used. I wouldn't waste money on the new one."
5,Dosnt Work,"i recommend this game, but the product was damaged, i couldnt play all the mission... i dont recommend to buy from this guy, but is up to you.the game is worthy"
4,Great book - wish it were longer,"I read this book immediately following the author's ""The Gift of Fear"". I don't agree that it's recycling material from his first book. I recognized maybe two stories and a few explanatory pages in the beginning. Instead, it discusses fear on a societal level instead of an individual level. I found it fascinating and enjoyed every page. I'm only deducting one star because I wish it were longer. As another reviewer said, I also think the author rushed through it a bit (which he mentions himself in the book) and I wish he would have either taken more time to write it, or add to it as a second edition. Still an excellent and easy read."
2,Fear Less: Worth Less,"After having read de Becker's masterpiece, ""The Gift of Fear"", I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. It sold out quickly at all nearby booksellers-never to be reordered. ""Fear Less"" appears to be a hasty, ill-prepared response to the panic the author perceives to have followed the terrorism of 9/11. The book offers no more insight about paying attention to intuition and pre-incident indicators in order to avoid becoming a victim than it does protecting one from a random bird dropping while standing outdoors. The logic just doesn't hold water for the ordinary citizen in his examples. PLEASE READ ""The Gift of Fear."" It should be required reading in all schools the world over. But ""Fear Less?"" Nah."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"I finally got around to read the book when I was traveling. I thought it was a rush to judgment and it capitalized on the 9/11 incident.It was a book full of common sense written with many words to fill content.I loved ""Protecting The Gift"" but I hated this one.Hopefully his next work won't be to capitalize on the market."
5,Good book,I was required to read this book for a college course. I believe it is a great book and was very pleased with the content. It has become one of my favorite books that I try to read once a year for fun. It really is an informative out of the box look at security in todays life.
5,A Must Read For All Airline Pesonnel,"Gavin de Becker has done it again! He has taken the brutal attack of September 11, and demonstrated how each of us can not only deal with our own fears and anxieties, but can also be the front line of defense for ourselves, our families, our communities, and our country.As a flight attendant working for a major airline, I was especially affected by the events we all witnessed on television. I suffered with severe post traumatic stress and anxiety, but, thankfully, since reading Mr. de Becker's book, Fear Less, I again have the confidence and enthusiasm to do the job I love, and to know that I can have control and power in any situation. Thank you so very much, Mr. de Becker."
3,Seems rushed... somewhat disappointing,"Some interesting new vignettes but lacks the power of the original Gift of Fear, a work I consider essential reading and a must own book. If you've already read that book, you really don't need this one. The essential points have already been covered. It's certainly not a bad book by any means, it's just doesn't hold its own against the extremely high standard of his first work. Seems like he rushed this one to press without giving it the full attention it deserves. It's probably worth buying used but I regret paying full price.Lawrence KaneAuthor of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instruction"
3,Buy the Gift of Fear Instead.,This book is just taking advantage of the Post 9/11 environment. Buy the Gift of Fear instead. By the way for semloh2287 the War in Afghanistan is going on two years later. It will probably go for another five or so until the NATO/US run away clinging to their helecopters. No oil there.
4,my good freind emo boy is right,i need to hang out with this guy we like the same and dislike the same. all together great cd sounds like mae
2,Generic,"Please tell me how ""waking ashland"" differs from any other tooth and nail records dime-a-dozen band? ""waking ashland"" is A-typical pacific northwest christian emo with a lead singer that sounds like the guy from acceptance, who also sounds like the guy from mae, who also sounds like the guy from number one fan, who also sounds like andrew mcmahon from something corporate. So on and so forth. ZzZzZzZz. Wake me up when this fad of bored sounding christian emo rock ends. I'll be falling asleep to jimmy eat world, texas is the reason and jawbreaker. Never heard of em'? Do yourself a favor and learn."
2,Entertaining but flawed,"The author paints himself in such self righteousness that its hard to take anything he says at face value. He also seems to overplay his importance to Senator Kennedy-I can't believe he was quite the superstar in the organization that he claims to have been.This book is an entertaining quick easy read. If you like gossip, you'll love the book, its filled with seemy stories, but I'm left with the impression that the author has a hidden agenda that he failed to let us in on. There's probably some truth in this book, but separating it from the authors own self delusions makes for an impossible feat."
3,An Interesting Read About A Fascinating Senator,This book provides a behind the scenes look at an individual who by all accounts is an extremely effective legislator. The author does appear credible and does provide a rare glimpse into a very complex personality. What's wrong with seeing the warts -- it certainly doesn't diminish the Senator's accomplishments. It's unfortunate that this book is out of print. It would be interesting to see where the sales of this book went to -- if supporters of Senator Kennedy didn't purchase all available copies to get it quickly out of the marketplace. It's unfortunate that St. Martin's Press -- a very couragous publisher -- didn't do a 2nd printing.
1,A stinker!,"It's a good thing for Mr. Burke for the Supreme Court's Times v. Sullivan decision. This stinking piece of fiction would otherwise be considered libelous. Ted Kennedy is probably the most influential senator of the past hundred years, yet Burke, who once worked for him, focuses only on tabloid-style gossip and hardly touches on the substantive impact Kennedy has had on the course of American policy and history. For a much, much better book on Ted Kennedy, read, ""Edward M. Kennedy"" by Adam Clymer."
5,Shocking Facts!,"The book ""The Senator"" is outstanding and if your curious about the Kennedy clan and always wanted to know what the real Ted Kennedy this is book for you its very imformative and gets you really sick what Sen. Ted Kennedy has gotten away with because of his name."
1,Give me a break...,"I have now read this book twice to try to get a different point of view, and it still makes me cringe. Now, I do feel as though some of the things in Mr. Burkes book did happen but, I cannot get over his choirboy presentation of himself. No one can particate in the activites that Mr. Burke claims to have participated in and be as angelic and innocent as he portrays himself to be. It appears as though he is trying to compare a filthy, classless, drugdealer(Senator Kennedy)and an innocent, babyfaced, ten year old choir boy(Burke). Please, I am fully aware that Senator Kennedy is far from perfect, but he is not the immature ""coke head"" Mr. Burke wants people to believe he is. This is yet another novel created purely for the reason of making money."
5,fascinating!,"The White Widow came and went, leaving our hero a shadow of a man. Although Lehrer's novel has an ending, the reader is allowed to bring further conclusions into play even after the book has been set aside. Jim doesn't let his story end with his ending...he allows his reader to end it with their own idesa or wishes. Thanks, Jim."
4,"Portrait of person, time and place","This portrait is so full, it really doesn't need the ""white widow"" of its title. In my opinion, a number of more realistic scenarios could have prompted what became the final action. This didn't, however, interfere with my enjoyment of the book.Having been a bus rider and a resident of TX, the ride rang true. You really get to know Jack Oliver and the world of post war TX bus driving. As with any well developed character, you miss Jack when the book is over.I recommend this book to those who like character studies or regional literature."
4,Definitely weird,"This is a very strange tale. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, but I don't think I want to plumb Lehrer's literary depths any further.Lehrer knows how to capture the moment -- and he can be extremely funny. But there's something lurking in this novel that I'm not completely comfortable with."
2,Almost all pure electrocrap,"I found this album for 10$ in a second hand store and I think I got totally ripped off.But still, there's actually a few very good songs on it. I loved ""Buzz Junkie"", ""Drinkin' 40z"", and especially ""Replicunt"". This is kind of ironic they did put them at the end. All of the remaining tracks are more electro-house. So you still might like it if this is your bag.But for myself, I'm sorry, I really did my best to appreciate it. I did listen to it many times and there's just nothing to do. Tracks like ""I Know What Woman Want"", ""Supermodel Inc."", ""Do I Look Like A Slut"" and ""Electroclash Anthem"" are just fashion house electrocrap. Sorry again for speaking my mind but this is really BADD.If you want to get the real stuff you should rather dig for ADULT., Magas, DJ HELL or Ladytron."
4,"another season, another twist",We need all the seasons on dvd... I will buy them the minute they are released. I am going insane with no releases being made since Palau. Its a dream to own all the seasons in their boxed sets and not from some crummy download made online.
5,Survivor Guatemala: The Maya Empire,Well another great survivor that I want. I so hope they release this on dvd. It would fit nicely into my survivor dvd collection very well. A amazing survivor with loads of culture involved. Also the survivors in this one are loads of fun and make this survivor really good. I would love to go back to memory lane and watch these episodes again. I love to show my grandmother this survivor she would really love this one. She's watched all the ones that I've bought on dvd which is all the ones that have been released so far to this date. Please release this one I'll buy it as soon as it's available thanks bye...
4,Survivor Guatemala Best Season Ever!,"WoW! This is by far the best Survivor ever! I really enjoyed it from beginning to end. You won't be disappointed and Survivor Guatemala is definitely worth every penny. This season had some very tough competitors and its interesting to see how alliances form and come toppling down from one episode to the next and how the backstabbers just keep dominating the entire game I really enjoyed the dynamics of all the survivors. My favorite players were Lydia, Stephanie, Brian, Gary, Judd, Bobby John, Jaime and Danni. The only negative thing would be the last episode called Live Reunion Show. Its only 11 min and not worth it."
1,Survivor Rip Off,I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show.
5,GOOD PRACTICAL ADVICE,"You cannot replace years of experience by reading a book.However ,with this book you can avoid some of the pitfalls on the way to getting those years of experience. The author writes clearly in a voice that is easy to listen to.This is a book of modest length without the pep talk and fluff found in some recent books on the subject.Overall a fine ,helpful book."
4,"havent installed yet, but looks do-able","I haven't installed this yet on my 2004 Chevrolet Silverado. But based on the instructions, it may not work on late model GM vehicles because of the reverse polarity system GM has on their trucks. Basically the red wire is negative and black is positive (had the same issue with my HID kit). I am hoping to try it out. But no promises, it was 25 dollars at the time when I bought it, so it was worth the risk to try it."
2,Nothing special,"I was somewhat disappointed in this collection, as I had not read anything by any of the authors other than Grisham, and was interested to see if there were any others whose novels I might enjoy. But although most of the stories were solid, and kept me insterested until the end, none of them had a very memorable or very satisfying conclusion. Moreover, at least two of the stories seemed to have no ending at all, rather, they just stopped. I wouldn't recommend this unless you already know that you're a fan of one or more of the authors, and even then, I would have to guess that their novels are better than what is found in this collection."
2,Could Have Been So Good...,"This book sounded so promising when I bought it, that I was terribly disappointed when I actually read it. Most of the stories are devoid of any substance whatsoever. I know that they are short stories, but they should be gripping and compelling just like the novels written by the same authors. They weren't. On the upside, it turned me on to several authors of solid legal thrillers like Steve Martini and Jeremiah Healy. If you buy this book, plan on using it more as a reference for future purchases than a good read immediately."
4,Good read,"This book is a great read for short story lovers and legal thriller buffs. It is nice to have a respectable collection of short stories in this genre. The stories are fast reads, and are great for bus rides, lunch breaks... Some stories are more entertaining than others, but all in all this is a good compilation. Don't waste time reading author profiles and afterwards. They aren't necessary to enjoy the stories."
2,poor decision,"I wanted a few good gel pens, and bought these on the strength of the uniball brand name. I regret this decision now, due to the poor writing these pens do. Yes, they function, but so far the one I have is worse than a usual cheapo BIC. It's scratchy, inconsistent, and will occasionally leave where I have just written completely blank. If you are looking for a nice ink pen, look elsewhere."
5,Uniball Signo 207,"I use the Signo 207 at work; it has spoiled me for nearly any other pen out there. I have, however, had a few of them die too early; for whatever reason, the ink flow just stops or is spotty after about 1/3 of the cartridge is spent."
3,Worth the money,"The pen looks OK and writes well also when it writes. If I write fast, the pen will skip a little and that irritates me, To be honest though, I don't use it every day and maybe that is the reason. My ball points don't skip though. If I put a little more pressure on the tip when I write it seems to work OK - most of the time. For the price though, you cant beat it."
1,Runs out of ink too quickly,"These pens might look good and write well for a short time, but there is a shockingly small amount of ink in each one. Uni-ball should be ashamed of itself for selling these pens with such a small amount of ink."
5,Repeat order. Here's why.,"These high capacity pens last longer, making the cost-per-mile quite inexpensive. The ink seems to get through the finger oil which can make other pens skip in the area down in the lower left of a notepad where a right-handed writer would grip the pages. The ink does take a little longer to ""dry"" but once you're aware of that the chance for a smudge is small. The ink also does not drift on various types of paper, as seen when you use a Sharpie type of instrument. I made the mistake of using a Sharpie for labels on long-term storage boxes, and a few years later the ink has spread, making the label almost illegible."
3,Pens are good but they smear,"These pens are great to have, a little pricey, but they smear and that's what makes it not a good pen to have with you unless you are writing things down and are not going to touch the paper you just wrote on for awhile."
4,Uni-Ball 207 Super Ink Gel Pen,"I went on a quest to find a great gel pen. This pen comes very close to the mark. The line thickness is good for a medium gel pen with no smears or blobs. The pen wrote with the first stroke. The ink dries quickly, but does lighten somewhat in color when dry. The ink can skip slightly, but does not do so frequently. Overall, the pen is a very comfortable size with a retractable point and good grip. The key selling point of Super Ink (which resists check alteration efforts) is a great feature for those of us who still write paper checks. I would buy these gel pens again either for myself or as gifts."
5,Review of Uni-ball Signo Gel 207 Pens,I ordered the black ink version of this pen. It's like a cross between a pen and a thin magic marker. The ink literally glides onto the paper. It flows effortlessly. My hand doesn't cramp with this pen when writing longer entries.
2,Sucks,"It is not very comfortable to write on these ball-pens. It is not very smooth at all. And I think I write very ugly using this ball pen. I do not recommend it, and the price is fairly high."
1,A permanent pen that permanently sucks,"Upon using the first pen in my three pack I was ecstatic with how smoothly these pens wrote. Then half way into a word they would stop writing and instead leave a trace mark of the letters in my paper, with no ink. It would do this a few lines per page, so I began to think maybe its the paper. It wasn't. I tried other pens on the same pages and they wrote consistently. As all the other reviewers have said, that gave this one star, it likes to stop working, and that's the truth. It is extremely frustrating to be a college student and having messy haphazard notes because of a ill-made pen."
2,Jealous pens,I got these pens for their security features but I found that these are very jealous pens. When you first get them they write wonderfully with very smooth and silky ink flows. If you put them into a drawer for week or so they will feel jealous and neglected and will not write well. Neglect them again and use other pens they will become very jealous and refuse to write at all. I have had over 10 of these pens in different colors and every one has stopped working after using only a small fraction of the available ink. All standard methods to revive the beginning relationship with its smooth and flowing line failed miserably.
1,Will Not Write Consistently,"Terrible pen. When you have to go back and re-write a few letters out of each word because your pen just wouldn't write, you know you have a terrible product."
2,Out of Ink,I bought a box and they run out of ink very quickly. I always lose pens long before they run out of ink. Not these. They are empty in a few weeks.
2,Dissapointed: requires scribbling and breaks easily,"I was disappointed with this product. I bought it because I wanted to have a pen that would write as soon as I picked it up every time. When the pens arrive they have a tiny cover over the tip so the first time you use it it does write immediately, however the cover is not reusable so if the pen then sits idle for a while, you have to scribble it for a bit before it will work. Perhaps I'm expecting too much.The second and more serious problem though, already two of the pens have broken. I am a fidgeter, but I'm not that mean to writing utensils, I've never had a mechanical pencil break on me, however these pens can't withstand my fidgeting. As another reviewer described, the very top of the pen breaks and comes out of the pen, so the whole thing becomes unusable."
2,TOP POPS OFF,"I love the looks of this pen but when you press down to write, the top pops off. This pen writes nice if you hold the top part down.The company must have quality control issues and I got a reject (4 pack). Too bad."
3,I like uni-ball,"I buy this pen because I used a uni-ball pen before, which is really convenient to write. However, this pen is not that good when you write."
2,Terrible luck with Uniball Gel Pens,"This pen looks beautiful but I've had terrible luck with these gel pens, including having brand new pens failing to deliver any ink, leaking pens, and gel ink only coming out intermittently from the tip. Based on my experiences with Uniball gel pens, I would never buy or use this product again. For gel pens, I prefer the super reliable and quality tip and feel of the Pilot G2 (I prefer the bold to the fine tip). Even the Bic Velocity Gel Pen is better pen than the Uniball."
4,my review,Very good pens. Plenty of ink and feel right in your hand. A bit pricey tho. But I like the 207s a lot.
2,"Writes nicely, but poorly built","After much research, I landed on this pen for my office. It does write extremely smoothly and evenly.HOWEVER, after a few weeks of use, the top of the cylinder cracks and the ""clicking"" mechanism begins to pop-out making the pen unusable. That said, you won't have much use for the refills, since it is the pen itself that breaks."
5,The are my favorite!,These are the best pens! The last forever and do not beed through paper! I will never buy any other type of pen!
4,Wrong length,"Thus is a good hammock but the reason I bought it is because of the length (9.5 advertised) I had a 7 foot one and I wanted a longer one for more play with the length and also a little wider. But when I got the hammock it was only 7 feet long, I was really disappointed. I did get the camo one so idk if it is because it is a patterned print so they make them shorter, and if it is true they should specify that they are shorter, and I would have goten a solid print instead, but a good hammock other than being short very light, and the fabric is thin and makes me a little nervous, but i trust it, and holds me well, would recommend to someone who was looking for a light weight backpacking hammock."
3,It is not easy hang like desciption says,"Description is misleading that ""it is easy hang"" since cord not long enough to wrap around tree. Cords are 3 inches with s hook at the end. You have to provide your own tree straps. Material is paper thin, will see how it holds up and update the review."
3,Its Cool,The hammock is cool and easy to carry and bring for an over night camp out. I'm 230 pounds and it holds my weight. I would recommend this if you are willing to set it up. The setting up of the hammock is a pain in the butt but when its set up its comfortable and relaxing.
5,Cheap First Hammock,"The price is right for anyone wondering if hammock camping is for them. I got one of them years ago and found that a hammock has advantages over pitching a tent or tarp: it can be set up on a slope, you're off the ground, and it's more comfortable. The main disadvantage is staying warm. so you'll still need a pad for insulation.If you like using a hammock, then go get a good one. I got a Hennessy Hammock that I'm happy with. You should go to their website just to learn to tie the under/over figure eight knot they use. It's easy to untie and doesn't slip.[...]"
4,You'll Never go back to sleeping pads again.,"I just got this today and just had to test it out in the backyard, all i can say is WOW, this with a good sleeping bag in and a small pillow is pure magic. Can't wait to try it out on my next time in the woods, for the first time I will get a good nights sleep (I really hate camping pads).My only issue was that is didn't come with any straps. But that is nothing that can't be fixed with some Webing and paracord. At first I was concerned with how a sleeping bag would work with the rather slick fabric, but it wasn't an issue.One word of advice, make sure your back pockets are empty BEFORE you even sit in the Hammock, the fabric is Very Thin and I am sure it wouldn't take much to tear."
4,Grand Trunk,"So far I have been quite happy with the product. I'm not certain how it will hold up, and I have read mixed reviews. This didn't deter me from purchasing. I also couldn't be happier with Amazon's customer service. The first shipment disappeared so they overnighted a second one. For that I'm greatful."
4,"Great Hammock, Crappy Ropes","I love how lightweight this hammock is, which is exactly what I wanted for a camping hammock. It's also easy to repack in its stuff sack; no fighting. The material is comfortable, though beware it's very breezy so it's not ideal for cold nights but I lay on it with a nice sleeping bag in the early morning hours and it was pretty comfy. I'm only giving it four stars though because the little rope ends are pretty darn terrible. One of the knots at the end of mine actually came undone while I was getting in the hammock for the fourth or fifth time. Upon retying it I realized just how short they really are; it was difficult to tie a decent knot with that minimal length. I'll definitely be replacing the end ropes and I agree with the other commenter who suggested swapping the s-hooks for carabiners. Despite the rope foibles, for the price and weight this hammock is awesome!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS CRAP!,"Please, save $15 and do NOT BY THIS HAMMOCK!This hammock was used about 2 times before it completely snapped. It is falsely advertised as being able to hold 250 pounds. I weigh exactly 145.62 lbs (just went to the ER a few days ago and had it checked). This was a nice light hammock, but it snapped after maybe 1 hour of total use. These hammocks are light and poorly made, and you definitely get what you want for $15: crap.I repeat, do NOT buy this hammock! If you spend a little more money, you can get a hammock that is durable enough to last more than an hour of holding 145 pounds.I must admit though, it is possible mine was faulty. Apparently other people like it. It could be mine was just a hiccup.Still, this hammock does not hold 250 pounds, and shouldn't be used for extended periods of time like sleeping."
3,Camping Hammock,"This hammock is the most compact one I've ever seen, if you want to sleep off the ground while camping, it's probably perfect. But I don't like it, the fabric is not very pleasant."
1,Beware - the pictures show the tree slings...,"Just bought this and somewhat disappointed. The official pictures for the product (not the user submitted ones) clearly show the tree slings. The tree slings do NOT come with this product and cost about $15-$20 extra. So basically doubles the price of this product. Yes, I know the listing says ""hammock hanging kit not included"" but the picture clearly shows them. My fault I guess (buyer beware and all) but please don't include pictures of other products unless they are included."
5,Karen from indiana,My son considers himself an outdoorsman and he will love this hammock. It's so lightweight and camo is his favorite color.
4,its great but,i wish it was mentioned that the hooks were a little tiny and are not compatible with some ropes that you try to use but overall good quality..
5,Awesome.,"I bought this hammock over two years ago, and it's definitely one of the best purchases I've literally ever made. This hammock has seen ridiculous use and has no rips (except for one in the pouch due directly to my dog). I roughly a minute, and take it back down in less. Super easy, fast set up! I switched out the s hooks for carabiners and bought tree straps instead of using the ropes; Now I can put it up in This hammock has held up to every test I've put it to, from hanging off the backs of the top of high school bleachers to... well, everything is about the same on a hammock. Ten stars out of five. Might buy it again in a few more years (it's looking like it will take that long to wear out), but I'd to try the new nano too. The price is gone down a little though on this, so I can probably just get both!"
5,Awesome for the price/Very sturdy and lightweight,"These are great for hikers and campers, maybe not the best for a permanent home hammock though.They are VERY lightweight and take up little space in your pack. They are easy and quick to tie around any two tree's within a decent range and the hammock is surprisingly comfortable. Also amazing how strong it is. This is the best bet for quality/price unless you want to go up past $50, but you still aren't going to get much better than this. For the price, you are getting an awesome lightweight, but large and heavy duty hammock that will last you many years."
5,best product ever,i dont care what any of the other reviews said cause im 230 lbs and i took this fine little diddy with me on a four day hike/fishing/camping trip in the catskills and it held up to my fat ass and believe me im not a gentle guy i figure it was under 20 bucks if it breaks it breaks and to no avail it held up perfectly fine! it was more than fine this thing is so comfortable you can lay any which way once you get your balance down its great you can wrap yourself up like a cocoon and keep the bugs or breeze out or even if you gotta pick your nose and there are alot of people around. i love this hammock and would suggest it to anyone under the 250 lbs rating of course
5,Excellent way to relax in the woods,"I absolutely love these hammocks. I bought one for my fiancé and one for myself and we put them up immediately to start lounging. We then brought them camping with us and everyone that went with us (11 other people) had to have their turn in the hammock. I even had a few friends swinging in them. They are strong, dry fast (it rained on them) and are very comfortable. My fiancé took a two hour nap in one and I took I fell asleep while listening to friends in the other. The fact that the stuff sack is attached is very helpful. We did not have any problem with the hammock and had people weighing at least 180-190 lbs sat in it and apparently others had problems with the ropes but we didn't . I highly recommend these."
4,Hammock,"Bargain hammock for day hiking. Decent fabric. Useable as is out of the box, but if you get into enjoying 'hammocking' you'll want to replace the ropes and S-hooks provided with good carabiners, longer ropes to allow you to tie up to larger trees/further apart, and tree straps.This is a good cheap choice for casually tossing into your day pack for a midday break on a long day hike, a car camping weekend, or a backyard. Packs down to about softball size.For serious hammock camping, you'll want a different model with sewn in mosquito netting, a rain fly, etc. Google 'hammock forum' for a nonprofit site with tons of great hammocking info."
4,A very good hammock and great deal,"The ropes it comes with do not allow for hanging it up between two large trees or two trees that are remotely close together, but if you find the right trees or get some more rope, its awesome.It is very compact and very lightweight.Its a great deal and completely worth every penny. Its legit."
4,Good quality for the price!,"I've used this hammock on several hiking trips and at many walk-in campsites. I'm a 185 lb. male and I've used it as a swing, plopped down in it, left it in my backpack next to pointy objects, transported it in a trunk bouncing around with firewood, etc. It's held up FINE, and I only paid $20 bucks for it... Not to mention that it's LIGHT and SMALL. Thus, you are likely to actually have it with you when you want to throw up a hammock. The material doesn't feel quite as nice as the ENO hammocks, but it's also way cheaper and gets the job done."
4,Worked well,For the price it was worth it. Tested it out this weekend and built A lean-too shelter. I had my concerns because it didn't feel like it would hold my weight. (215 LB). It worked just fine. Just one issue was that it doesn't like to spread well when you are in the hammock. Other then that it was fine.
4,Fun,Hammock camping has become my preferred way to camp. This hammock was taken into the mountains and performed very well. Its light and rolls up small. This is a lower end hammock but excellent for beginners. I'd recommend some YouTube searches on hammock suspesion knots. The easier the better. One can use a military poncho to cover up most of your hammock but a 5'x9 tarp or basha is better. Plastic sheeting will work on the cheap. Only four stars because you still need a bug net.I would buy this again and or gift it.
5,Perfect Travel Hammock for Relaxation Use (with a Great Price!),"I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband since we go to the North Shore almost every weekend. It is perfect! Very easy to set up between various coconut trees without hurting them, it's lightweight, packs down very small, it's durable, and it's comfortable. It's nice not to have to lug the big chair with us. I decided to go with the Grand Trunk brand because I wasn't really sure of the real differences between the two brands. The differences I did find were in the material, price, and strap setup. Based on the reviews, the material seemed to be more breathable and ideal for Hawaii climate. The strap setup- well I didn't find the rope to be as user friendly or easily compatible with different scenarios (based on the reviews of course) so I did buy the ENO slap straps pro to use with it. And the last difference: price. I couldn't pass it up. GT was 1/3 the price of ENO so..."
4,"A good hammock, but ...","A good hammock, but you have to be a bit careful with it or the thing can rip easily and the strings that tie it to a tree or whatever, can be shredded or torn easily. A better quality hammock will alleviate frustrations."
2,sad,I was kind of upset it literally just came with the hammock and didnt come with the ties and hooks for the tree.. so when I got it for my bf for christmas I found out that I now have to buy the kit its telling me to buy.
4,you need to buy additional accesories,"I could finally try the hammock last week in the only day that wasn't raining in this very wet spring in New England.It was my fault that I didn't check the details of what i was buying, but I thought it was ready to be hung, and it is not. You need to buy additional accessories. I ended up buying two different straps, because the first one I ordered after buying the hammock wasn't long enough for the distances between trees in my backyard.That being said, the hammock is OK. Very light. I think it's perfect for carrying, for camping anywhere. It weights almost nothing, easy to assemble disassemble, with the additional straps you need to buy."
4,As advertised,Product works as advertised. I hung it between to trees in the backyard and used it a few times. I would have liked a mesh product better I think. The material is breathable but when it's 100 outside and 80% humidity mesh or the like is key.
5,Great purchase,I bought this hammock because it is lightweight and compact. Easy to toss in a backpack. It comes with two cords to wrap around any mid sized tree and is very easy to hang and secure. No damage is done to the tree and the hammock provides a relaxing spot to read a book or take a nap in the midst of nature's best. A great price for a great hammock. NO regrets here!!!!
3,Be careful what you order,"I ordered the green version of this over a year ago and loved it. It came with straps and packed down nicely into an attached bag that fit easily in my hand, so it didn't take up any room at all in my backpack. Unfortunately it got lost on a trip, so I recently had to order another one. I like blue, so I decided since the product descriptions were the same, surely it'd be the same, travel-friendly hammock I fell in love with.It wasn't.First off, it didn't come with straps, which I see has become a recent issue with them. But what really bugged me was that it wasn't as portable. The hammock packed down into a much bigger sack which took up too much room in my bags. I like to travel as light as possible, so a hammock in a bag as big as a notebook doesn't cut it. I returned the blue one and have decided to try again with the green. Maybe it's a color issue..."
2,NO ROPE!,After reading reviews it seemed as though rope was included. HELLLLNO! Don't buy. You'll have to buy an extra $15 of rope. Very angry and disappointed.
1,Not so good,I am a big guy so this hammock didnt work so well for me. I dont think it works very well for tall guys and it doesnt seem to be too strong. I received it as a gift but had to regift it. Maybe its okay for shorter people.
1,Perfectly Dissapointing,"I purchased this hammock to sleep in on duty days, being on a ship there are plenty of hard points to hang from. However, after 10 fantastic nights, I shifted in my hammock and ended up on the floor.I was worried about the negative reviews, and they were right, I weight 190, and didn't have anything sharp in my pockets nor had shoes on and i still ended up on the deck. so Buyer beware! This hammock may work for you but for me it did not."
1,"Ripped first use, no ropes included","This hammock came without any tree ropes and ripped the first time it was entered. Too bad that the 30 day return period had lapsed befor taking it on a trip and trying it out. An email I sent to GrandTrunk has received no reply. So I have learned a $20 dollar lesson. Based on some other reviews here, be careful!"
3,where are the ropes??????,"These are the second and third hammocks of this kind that I have purchased as gifts. The first one I bought had ropes to wrap around the tree to hang the hammock from. When I read the other reviews before purchasing many of the top reviews stated that ropes were included. When I received my shipment of the additional two hammocks, neither one had ropes included. I then read further into the reviews and many people had the same experience. I don't know if this is a fluke but it makes me wonder how some are arriving with ropes for attachment and some not. So don't expect them and if they come with ropes.......you got a bonus! I will now have to purchase strapes for each new hammock that I just bought."
4,"Good, Cheap Basic Platform","I couldn't be happier with this product. Ive used it twice now for overnight backpacking trips. It isn't very wide but you'll find that you simply don't need to toss and turn in the night if you use a hammock because there are no pressure points on your body. Its light weight, folds into its sack easily and dries quickly. When you compare this hammock to the more expensive models, I'd pick this one every time. It does need a little modifications. Get rid of the bulky S hooks and replace them with lightweight climbing carabiners and replace the old poly ropes with the ENO Slap Strap Pro for an incredibly quick and efficient platform."
4,Hangin in There,"Love this. I only gave it 4 stars because it stretched a little but it's $25 bucks, so what do you expect? It's fabric is sturdier than I expected, it came with cords which you will need to extend if your trees are big. The fabric is so cheery to have around the campsite. I added an 8 dollar mosquito netting that I got on Amazon as well and I was all set."
3,broke after 2 years,"Yes this is a great product but if your weight more than 240 pounds it probably wont last long. On my 5th camping trip using the hammock, it ripped completely at the ends."
4,Perfect for camping,Awesome hammock that packs down to a very small size. I was able to fit it into my book bag during a trip put west for some camping. Very comfortable to sleep in. I was able to find two trees that were close together and use it as a sling chair too. This hammock and a sleeping bag and a camp stove is all you need for a weekend.
2,arrived missing parts and not great to use..,"packs small but bag is already ripping off the side after just a few uses, it did not have anything to tie it up with and when lying down you get wrapped up rather tight.Overall I would say spend more and get something that might last more than a few shorts uses. Although rated to 250 or 300 lb we heard the material start to rip at the ends with two people that combined came to about 210 lbs...The best thing about this product is that it is light , packs very small I could not even pretend one could sleep in this."
1,Ripped on the first trip,Bought this item after reading all the reviews and was certain that this was the appropriate hammock for my 12 year old to take to boyscout camp. The very first day the hammock ripped and that was the end of it! Needless to say that he was very disappointed.We have applied some duct tape and will try if that works for the next camping trip. Will pay a little more next time and get something better.
4,Nice hammock,The hammock is good for the money. I weigh about a buck 50 and it was fine with me and my 5 year old son. Not sure I would feel quite the same if I were 200lbs. It's definitely light weight and easy to pack.
4,"Ethology as metaphor, done well","Bleibtreu is the right spelling of the author's name. HIs book , three decades ago, was one of a number of studies using animal-behavior studies to illuminate ""the human condition."" Robert Ardrey, Desmond Morris, etc, made headlines, money, and serious intellectual mistakes by treating the analogies (extrapolations) as equations. Bleubtreu is smarter than that. And the material he gathers is wonderful -- the introductory example of the cattle tick whose concept of time is defined by its willingness to wait thirty years on the tip of a grass stalk for a cow to wander by (or something that smells a little like a cow) has stuck with me for . . . thirty years."
1,Nothing But Fallacies,"I first encountered this book in college. I was just finishing up a logic class and was working on an assignment to present two sides of an argument. I figured this book would help me greatly in my chosen topic, creation vs. evolution. Was I ever disappointed.I read chapter after chapter, impressed by the qualifications but not by the content. Every author used the fallacies I'd been studying in class & presented very little in the way of solid evidence or arguments. Some were even laughable in their leaps of logic.Even the title is fallacious if you think about it. There are respected scientists who are creationists.Creation vs. evolution is a serious subject that deserves careful evaluation. Unfortunately, this isn't the book to do it. Look elsewhere to find what evolutionists say to creationists' arguments."
1,Too Technical,"I found this book to be a difficult read. It is too technically written, and there is little ""plain English"" explanations of the technical parts, just more technical jargon. What should be an interesting debate on the the subject of Creationism versus Evolution is instead turned into a tedious book of accusations against the Creationists. This is not to say that every author included in this book was tedious. Many were very informative and interesting in their essays."
1,Do I *have* to read more of this book?,"I was excited to find this book, in the hopes that it might give me some reason to continue in my beliefs of evolution. I was hoping that an objective look by scientists would give reasonable reasons to support the theory that everyone believes. But, page after page, article after article is filled with people trying to prove what they believe. Instead of looking at things objectively, the contributors to this book unveil their assumptions and their beliefs- regardless of what evidence they might find.Contributors and authors insult and degrade the scientists who interpret the evidence differently. Is such an attitude necessary? (on EITHER side?)I'm interested in finding someone who is willing to look at the evidence *before* they say, ""Well, we know creation is a bunch of crap, so let's find out what REALLY happened.""I'm disheartened at reading this book, because it makes dialogue on this issue seem all the more difficult to achieve."
2,One Good Article: Remainder is Garbage,"Dr. David Raup, an evolutionary paleontologist, is the only author of this volume who tells it like it is. He chides his fellow evolutionists for misrepresenting and belittling creationism and creationists. The remaining articles are predictably bad. Even the title itself is prejudicial and poisons the well. It implies that creationists are not scientists, a clearly false statement in view of the fact that thousands of degreed scientists the world over are creationists. Defining them away as such does not change their status as scientists one iota."

4,505 Jeans,Good fit and good length. A bit wide through the leg but not a big deal. Happy overall with the purchase.
1,Levi 505 jeans missing belt loops,"My husband has worn 505 jeans for his whole life but that is about to change. I bought him 3 pairs, removed the tags, he wore them and we noticed there was a big gap at the waist, on the back-side. We discovered Levis has removed 2 loops ""in a cust-cutting move"". Well, their cost-cutting has lost this customer. It is SO annoying! Levis, wake up and put the loops back or you've lost this customer for good."
2,Fake Levis,"Levis from another land.My favorite since 1957.These new red tabs have been washed (2) times and the belt loop over left rear pocket is already tore off leaving a 1/2"" hole. The right leg outer seam starts is correct at top but ends in the center of my foot at the bottom.CrOoKeD....FOR LEVI ONLY..NO OFFENSE TO AMAZON!!!! GOOD JOB TO AMAZON IN ALL THAT THEY DO FOR MY FAMILY..."
5,This jean is just what I expected.,"I've always bought Levi's 505 or 501 and have never been desappointed. The quality of the fabric and the stitching is impeccable, and the final product is almost perfect. In conclusion, you can't get a man's jeans that is better than these."
2,What happened to the quality?,Compared to the quality of Levis I owned a few years ago these don't even come close. They are paper thin and I was almost afraid to put them on without tearing them. I guess we'll see how long they last.
2,It is no original 505 Levis,I am buying this model more than 5 years.The main important things for me is how it fits and a ZIP.I don't like the bolts.I like Levis because it fits good and quality of material acceptable.There is only one but important problem: Levis changed the model but does not change the model number.So it is not original 505. Go to the store and check again do you like it before to buy.
3,Not what it used to be,"I bought these jeans to replace an older pair of 505s. Other comments about fit are true, they are slimmer. However the material is flimsy and the construction is poor. I've decided to keep them but the rivets are shoddy and the material is like gauze. I'm going to have to find another brand. Levi's are (generously) second rate now and not worth the price. What a shame."
1,These are Not 505s,"I too have been a long-time fan of the now departed 505 Regular Fit jeans. The decision to summarily drop this enduring style and substitute a new low-rise version--the abominable 505 Straight Fit--is positively baffling. I can only ponder what the folks at Levi Strauss were smoking at the time.But hold on, I found a substitute: L.L. Bean Double L Classic Fit jeans. They fit like the old 505 Regular's and are of equal quality (although I prefer five belt loops a la the 505s rather than seven). And the current price is $35 vs. a minimum of $40 for comparable 505s. I guess the extra $5 buys you the ""Levi"" label. I just don't think it's worth it any more."
1,poor quality material,"These jeans are not of the quality you would expect from the levi brand...Much thinner material, never thought Levi woulddo this............"
1,Levis has changed 505 style,"Check out the Levis website for reviews and complaints about the new 505s. They have changed the fit (the rise) so that the jeans fit about 1 inch lower at the waist. Many guys are having trouble with the fit as being uncomfortable. They do not stay up! For some, the 550 is unchanged and may work. As for me, I am changing brands after 45 years of buying Levis."
1,The FIT has changed from the old Levi 's 505's! BAD!,"For years, I have always been able to buy jeans for my husband without any problems -- Levis 505 regular fit. I recently ordered and received a couple of new pair for him, and OMG ... they were a completely different fit! Both pair! They ride low, and the overall fit is not flattering - at all!!! Levi's has RUINED a perfect fitting jean! I WANT THE OLD 505'S BACK!!!!"
1,Fit changed without warning,"I've been wearing Levi's 505 Jeans for 30 years, and could always rely on the fit. When I put on these jeans, the fit was nowhere close. When I measured, the rise was about 3 inches shorter than the standard Levi's 505. Why would any sensible company do that? There are an infinite number of numbers. If you want to change the fit, why not change the number too. In the past, when Levi has introduced new jeans, they have used new numbers, e.g. 550. The basic point is that these jeans don't fit right, and now I have to start shopping for another brand."
1,Straight Fit a Complete Disappointment,"I have worn Levis Regular Fit jeans for many years. They have always fit comfortably. I bought a pair of the Straight Fit jeans thinking they were the same jeans with a new name. The description on the tag is identical to that on the Regular Fit jeans. Both say ""Sits at Waist"". Not really. The seat has been changed (I have a 32"" waist and am not trying to squeeze into too-small jeans) and the rise is different. I understand that companies must innovate to remain competitive. I don't understand why anyone would change an established brand and make it useless to its core customers. If Levis wants to attract new customers it should have made the new fit explicit by giving it a new model number. This change reminds me of the ""New Coke"" fiasco. Maybe Lee or Wrangler will do instead."
3,What Now?,"I was just thinking of buying a pair of 505 jeans today without giving it a second thought - it is what I have always worn. But I started reading the reviews and I will not be buying them. Not sure what kind of brand managers Levi's has, but if they think you can update a classic, change the fit that has been consistent as long as I can remember, and then still call it a 505, they are just out to lunch. In essence, there no longer is a 505, just some new jeans using the number it has no right to."
4,Levi's Men's 505,Service was good. Order another color and it was back ordered and then out of stock. Which was to bad because it was the pair of jeans I really wanted.
5,Just what I expected,"I know how Levis fit me, so sizing was not an issue. I have never worn this style/color before, though. Amazon's review was accurate, and when I got them I felt like they were exactly what I expected. I like the way they look and fit. As always, Amazon delivery was prompt."
3,levi's inconsistent standard,"this is the second pair of levis i ordered through amazon. it was identical to the first pair except the first was made in lesotho the second in egypt. both were 36x29, but the second, the one under review here, the one of egyptian manufacture, was somewhat tighter, really almost too tight, and the button hole was too small, had to be forced. clearly levi strauss no longer has the standard for which they were famous, and here as in so much else caveat emptor (latin for 'buyer beware')."
1,Levi 505's not the real 505's any more. DON'T BUY!!!,"I've been wearing Levi 505's exclusively since the early 70's. They fit me perfect. I could just walk into a store and pick up my size and buy without trying them on. Best jeans around.Well not any more! Without any notice they have changed the ""Regular fit"" 505's to ""Straight fit"" jeans which means they are no longer 505's at all. The waist is larger, the crotch is higher and you must now wear them down on your hips as kid do with their jeans. These are no longer meant for adults or anyone who wants pants that fit properly. I also don't like 550 relaxed jeans as they are too baggy.I'll be looking for a different brand and returning the two pair I just bought. Hopefully Levi will lose enough faithful customers to make them rethink this rude abandonment of loyal customers."
1,505s in Name Only - Levi's Has Ruined This Old Favorite,"I've been happily buying and wearing 505 Regular Fit jeans for many, many years. I did not notice before submitting my most recent order that Regular Fit has been replaced by Straight Fit. But, boy, did I notice a change once they arrived. These aren't the same jeans at all. The fabric is less substantial and - most disheartening to me - the rise is a good inch lower than it used to be. That is, the waistband sits lower on the hips. They feel wrong to me, like I need to pull them up all the time. And they feel cheap. I can't wear them.In my opinion, Levi's should have been more forthright about this change. This new jean should have received its own new model number and they should have retired the 505 number entirely. Because these are not, in any manner that's important to me, anyway, 505s.Now I have to find another brand of jean whose waistband sits up at my waist where I like it. What a hassle. So very disappointing.Levi's, you screwed up."
1,Beware Levi's Change to the 505 Jeans,"I have worn Levi's 505 Jeans for 25 years. I even have a box of ""34's"" in the attic for when I lose a couple of pounds.I just sent back 2 new pairs of these jeans because they no longer fit as the other pairs I own. I called Levi's to find out why.I was told that they changed the fit several months ago, without changing the numeral designation. 505's are now only made as ""Straight Fit"" rather than ""Regular Fit"". In addition, they have lowered the ""Rise"" to a ""below the waist"" fit, rather than the old ""at the waist"" fit.Sorry Levi's, you can't do that without losing long-term customers. How can you change something as basic and important as fit, but still call it the same thing?Levi's Mens 505 Straight Fit Jean"
1,"Warning - 505 ""straight fit"" not the same as ""regular fit""","Warning! Be advised that the new 505 Straight Fit jeans have replaced the original 505 Regular Fit jeans. They are not the same. Try these on in a store before ordering online or you will be disappointed. Apparently, somebody at Levi's had the bright idea of changing a tried and true style rather than creating a new one; a classic example of ""if it aint broke, don't fix it""."
3,Levis 505,Ok jeans. Purchased for a xmas gift I should have double checked before wrapping. The fabric seems completely different and thinner than the 505 I always purchase.
2,Levis intentionally changing size - waist larger than before,"Asked for and received a pair of 33x30s for Christmas. Even after washing, the waist is a full inch larger than my previous 505s. Levis Customer Service confirmed that they are intentionally changing the sizing: ""Our Levi's 505 Regular Fit jeans are currently carrying a more relaxed waist shape than before. If the 33 waist size was too big for you I can definitely recommend for you to down one size."" Fortunately Amazon accepted this as a defective return (no return shipping charge), but after reading other comments about size variability depending on country of manufacture, I hesitate to buy online."
2,Something is wrong here,"After levis discontinued the mens perfect fit 512's i was ready to give up buying from levi strauss but decided to give the 505 a try and I'm not happy. My first thought was these have to be a knock off brand made by some other company that simply puts a levis label on them. I am not saying they are , they just feel cheap , not like levis I have bought in stores. They are thin and feel like a poorly made denim material not the stiff denim i associate with levis of old. I washed them and wore them for a day. After 8 hours they had stretched so much they looked like they were two sizes to big and baggy. Not sure if these are the same as sold in stores but if they are levis has lost a long time customer..... The only good thing I can say is that the shipping was fast."
2,Not the same thing at all :-(,"My 17-year-old son has worn Levi's 505s, in the same size (32x34), for several years. He hates these new jeans. They're too tight/narrowly cut. Yes, we'd read the other negative reviews, which is why we ordered only one pair, but it seemed to be mostly older guys complaining about the fit. Trust me, tall, slender young men have now also found these jeans to be uncomfortable. Levi's should bring back the old 505 jeans and give this new product, if they choose to continue it, a different number because they're not the same thing at all. We will need to find a new jean."
4,"Perfect fit, very good shipment",Size: Perfect fit. Shipment: very good. Quality:good. Color: exactly the same of the picture. For all these reasons I strongly recommend this product.
1,Not the same as the old 505s,"I have a pair of Levi's 505 regular fit that are great. I couldn't find 'regular fit' option anymore and thought I would give this a try. No luck, they don't fit well, and are made of considerably thinner material than my old ones."
1,Are these really Levi's!? Would NOT buy again,These can't be real Levi's?!; the fabric is thin as a handkerchief and the stitching is cheap single stitched cotton thread. If I had the chance to feel these before buying of course I would NOT have bought them and bought the real thick Levi's jeans. Costs more to ship back from here overseas than the jeans cost.Very disappointed in Amazon because these were sold through Amazon.
2,Only the name remains the same,"These Levi's 505 jeans that I bought for my husband fit nothing like his old 505's do. He has always loved this style, but the styling has been changed so that the same size that once fit him like a glove is now at least 1"" and probably 2"" too big in the waist, and the rise is shorter by the same amount. If they wanted to make a new style, then, OK, but don't call 'em 505's!!"
3,Levis,"I ordered two pair, in different washes/colors. One pair is as expected, the other is bigger all over, though it says 30x32, just as the one that fits does. I am keeping both, but will need to get a good 2inches hemmed in length."
1,ex-levi customer,"These pants are unacceptable. lightweight denim will not stand up. crotch is cut all wrong. I had been been wearing this type of jeans for over 40 years, and they have gotten progressively shoddier. Made in china junk. levis is clearly more interested in the 'high end' androgenous customer. Can' even find the standard jean jacket anymore. I'll be looking for a quality jean elsewhere. Sadly, it probably won't ne made in the USA.."
1,Appalled,I have been buying exclusively levi jeans for over 45 years. I have been buying size 32x30 for as long as I can remember. Today I bought 3 pair of 505 regular fit straight leg jeans and the waist was not even close. Must be at least 34. They fall down. I put them up against my old jeans and there is a huge difference. Almost 50 years of product loyalty and they have let me down. I have bought my last pair.
1,Spring '10: New fabric = junk!,"Absolute junk! I've noticed a decline in the quality over the last decade, i.e. the pocket stitching actually pulling away from the pant and making holes within months. But the new denim fabric is probably half the weight / thickness as it was for last year's 505s. I've been wearing 505s for construction since the early 80s. The new ""denim"" feels less substantial than their Dockers line. Levi, you've lost a 30+ year (once dedicated) customer."
5,Great buy !!!,No hassle in the purchase AND I bought from Australia.Had the jeans shipped to my relartives in California and they forwarded them to here in Melbourne.WILL buy again.Amazon in the king.
2,Levis 505 House Cat,"The color and texture is fine but the size is totally different from the original 30x30. I use to wear 505's in size 30x30 and they fit and feel different. I'm very dissapointed with Amazon and especially with Levis quality control, the sizes are different depending on the country the pants were manufactured. They don't have quality standards as other jeans brands."
2,"SHRINKS! 505 Straight Fit Jean, Tumbled Stretch color","I haven't seen this problem with any of the other reviews so I suspect it may be related to the color/fabric ""Tumbled Stretch."" When washed they shrank down a good two sizes, at least two inches smaller in the waist and the length. Hoping amazon will let me return them because my boyfriend can't wear them and they're even too small for me. Shrinking two whole sizes is just a bit too much to be normal.I would give the pants another shot in another color/fabric because before washing they fit perfectly. A little stiff like too much starch but perfectly. Then again, we picked out the straight fit because the pants he's worn through were the same brand and style which is the only reason we ordered them online."
2,Not what I expected,"Just because it says ""505"" does not mean it is like the same old 505s you used to wear. True, these are cut the same, but the weight of the fabric is maybe half that of my older jeans. I suppose the lesson is that books can be purchased online, not clothes."
1,Horrible - Levis Changed The Fit,"I bought these Levis because I haved owned many pairs in the past and they have always been good quality jeans I could trust. Levis was recently bought and since has tried to change their look to appeal to the younger crowd. They messed with just about every type of jeans except the 501 but that has button fly and I prefer a zipper fly. The fit is super low rise on these 505 and every time I sit my backside shows and I can't stand it. My old 505s did not do this. The material is now super low quality and is not worth the price I paid for them. They shrink uncontrollably and now they are short at the leg opening exposing my ankle. These are horrible jeans in terms of fit and quality, look elsewhere until this company learns it lesson not to mess with a good thing."
2,Size,"I have a Levis 505 34 x 32 but it is smaller, I do not know if regular fit is equals straight fit"
4,Odd texture,"We search for Levis 505 straight leg jeans size 35 waist and 33-34 length.Plus, my husband only likes the darker hues. So this was -- literally -- the onlyseller who had a pair that fit the criteria. They were shipped and received earlierthan expected. When he tried them on, they looked a strange, but the 'instructions'said they should be washed first before deciding. So we did. I think they need tobe washed a lot. One wash didn't change anything--except for a slight twist to theleg seams, which I did fix by ironing--but who wants to do that? So, we are keepingthem because the size is impossible to find elsewhere."
4,505 Still a Reliable Jean,"The Levi jean has been a favorite of ours for over 35 years. Fits well, wears well and washes well.Only thing we noticed is the material does not seem as starchy as they usually feel when purchased new. Generally the jean material felt softer than we expected from a new jean."
5,Levi Jeans,"As expected, the jeans were perfect. Fit well and looked great. Arrived as expected. I shop at Amazon a lot and have never been disapointed."
3,Wrong Color,"The jeans are great, but you sent me the wrong color. I asked for Highland and it looks like you sent me Range. I like the sent color, so I've decided to keep them - to avoid the long wait of a return. But for the record, I think your system for getting the right color and styles is kinda effed!"
5,"Great, Comfy, and As Advertised",Very nice jeans that I enjoy wearing. They fit and look great. It was scary to order jeans online but they came perfectly and looked great. I'll be ordering more soon.
1,Defective item,Good afternoon ... how is possible that companies such as Amazon and Levis sell and send defective items without going through a quality control. One pair of pants that I purchased came with one sleeve shorter than the other. How may be possible coming from you? What can I do with this piece of rag?
1,spoiled goods arrived broken the jeans,spoiled goods came the jeans torn at the front on both legs and the back left pocket near the fabric was torn as if defeated.....!
5,Levi's jeans,"This is the best way to buy Levi's. I know my size and fit. The price was very competitive and they arrived in a few days. Levi's don't change over the years, thankfully, so ordering them online was very easy."
2,Talla Diferente a la indicada,"El pantalón está en buenas condiciones, pero la talla indicada en la etiqueta está errada pues la talla real es 34x32."
1,very bad,"Ladies and GentlemenI politely inform you that since I start my shopping over the Internet through you had no problem with the products supplied, though two of the pants I purchased with this latest purchase came with defects in order to use them because the outer and inner side lines of these pants because they have defects in their court and do not stay in place and therefore can not use the same lost by giving purchase to have no complain but given that I have requested to report thereon, and not interest me that I returned merchandise credited me or give me money but I guarantee full power to do my shopping in a safe and efficient"
1,It's as if they are bootlegging their own product: redesigned and ruined; a waste of money.,"I have never had a pair of levis fall down before. These used to be work pants: it used to be that if you got any levis in the right waist size, one thing you could count on was them not falling down. Not anymore. That, combined with the use of a much lighter weight denim, make these a waste of money at $40 dollars. It's as if they are bootlegging their own product with cheaper materials and sweatshop tailoring. You are better off buying some lee's or dickies at half the price. Two thumbs way down."
2,Too few belt hoops,"For a company that specializes in jeans, you would think belt hoops would be something they know you need. Only one in the back does not keep your belt where it needs to go in the back. It makes the waistline belt go over the denim. I looked at my other jeans from Lands End and others, and they all have 3 in the back. One over each pocket, one in center."
1,End of an era,"Since junior high school in the '70's, I have never NOT had a pair of Levi's 505's in my closet. That's going to change once my current pair-bought at the flagship Levi's store in San Francisco, no less-finally gives up the ghost. The switch from ""regular"" fit to ""straight"" fit means 505's are now completely different pants. The waist is easily two inches lower on your hips, the circumference of the legs probably two inches less, too. If you're not a malnourished punk rock musician with no butt, you're going to look like ridiculous in these pants. And you'll feel ridiculous, too. Levi's is clearly targeting a different market from, um, everyone who ever bought these pants in the past, so good luck with that."
1,Something smells,"When I bought the jeans they seemed to be a good price. I received them ""on time"" and right away something seemed wrong, they stunk! They smelled like they had been in sewer water. Were these made in a 3rd world country and washed in a polluted river? The first thing I did was throw them in the wash. More bad news, they bled so badly that the rest of the wash was stained blue! I had to run the wash several more times. The good news is that the pants didn't stink anymore, the bad news is that several articles of light colored clothing were ruined.On the bright side, they fit well and look good."
3,Levis Not Consistant,"Levi's Regular Fit 505(tm) Jeans Black Out 38x32I purchased a quantity of 2 -- one fit perfectly and one was slightly large in the waist and long in the inseam. The tag indicated the size that I had purchased, but the fit was off. I would say that it was about a half size too large."
5,Excellent service,One pair had to be back ordered. Company sent them priority mail. Pleased with product and service.
1,Men's 505 straight fit jeans,"I purchased these jeans for my husband, who is not usually very fussy. However, these jeans are made from extremely poor denim which was noticeable immediately. After wearing them once, they all went a bit fuzzy and seems to be pilling already. Very poor quality. I would have returned them immediately other than not worth the postage. They are now used for camping purposes only!!"
1,Worst Jeans I've Ever Bought,I have been buying Levis for 40 years and can't believe the jeans I just purchased.They have gone down in quality and up in price. They feel like a cheap pair of designerjeans. The weight of the material is lighter and they have reduced the number of belt loops.I hate them. I will buy Carhartt from now on. Much better quality.
2,Jim's review,They don't fit like the previous 501s I've purchased. Probably safer to purchase at a local store after trying on.
2,Changes to size,I have worn 505 jeans for many years and I purchased the same size (waist and length) this new pair is about an inch too big around the waist and the cut is different to previous 505's. It is an uncomfortable fit.
4,A great pair of jeans- different from the 501's,"I was glad to find these jeans in a size 35 waist, since I had only seen Levi's in even-sized waist only. The color is a great stonewash hue, ideal for me. Two important differences compared to the 501's: ONE, the 505 has a zipper instead of metal buttons on the fly (a well-known feature); TWO, less known is that the rise in the 505's is lower than the 501's. The difference in the rise, in my pants is a 1 1/2"" lower rise in the 505's, something I am not used to."
2,Fake?,"On the red Leib on the pocket is not a word Levi's, but only mark R. On the inside of the pockets are no inscriptions. This is the second pair 505, the first one was perfect, but it does not sit well and too small. I am very disappointed."
2,good looks but too tight in the thighs,"The pants seem to be acceptably made (the label indicates it was made in Cambodia) - although slightly thinner material than I expected. The color that I ordered (Blue Collar) is fine and is what I expected. However, these pants are way too tight on the thighs - especially when sitting down, and it makes the length appear much shorter because of it. I though about keeping them, but I cannot put up with the tightness at the thighs. Also, the pockets seem to ""bunch up"" too much and you must often put your hands in your pockets to keep them down...a major fail, so I'm returning them and will try out the Levi's Men's 560 Comfort Fit Jean instead."
3,Questionable Quality,I have to agree with some of the other reviewer comments regarding the decline in quality for Levi jeans. The material seems a lot thinner than the last pair of jeans I purchased. Besides the flimsy material the jeans didn't fit well either. I have worn the same size jeans for the past several years. I would swear the pair I just purchased on Amazon was at least a size too big. I ended up buying the size pair of Lee jeans on Amazon and they fit just right and the quality of material was a lot better. Lee jeans has a new customer.
1,Change in 505 cut,"I've purchase Levi's 505 jeans my entire life, but recently purchased a couple of pair and found that the cut has been changed to a low-ride jean. Found similar experiences posted by other folks. Very disappointed. Seems that Levi Strauss is trying to lure in a new demographic (that like to have that modern everything exposed cut) at the expense of long term customers. Bad corporate decision making. Recommend that folks looking for the old 505 cut try the Austin jean if they can get them. Probably not as high quality, but about half the price and similar in fit to old 505's."
2,Good quality...Careless finishing,"I've found that the finishing/hemming of the jean's length is consistently off. No matter what measurement you choose, the pants are either just right or two long. I haven't found any to be too short...yet. Also, Levi's is always changing the rise of the jeans. The new ones I just purchased are lower than my older ones. I do like Levi's quality though. They really hold up."
1,UN american made,jeans are of lighter weight material. Not as durable and one of the five belt loops has already torn off because of the poor quality. I will not be buying Levi's again. Very disappointing. If I had wanted these cheap knock offs I would have went to Wally World.
2,Size is a crap shoot,"I love 505s but I've found that if I order 3 pairs, all three will fit completely differently. The faded jeans tend to be really tight and low cut so that they barely cover your backside, the traditional stonewash seem to have the truest fit to the original 505s and the ""trendy"" washes I've bought are all over the map. I've stopped buying them online because I have to keep sending them back. It's a lot easier to wait for a sale locally and go try them on."
4,just fit me~~~,"Evaluation of 4.5 stars, the 39.99 buy levis w30-l32 505 jeans, size is very appropriate, my height is 178cm, weight 58kg, only the material of the pants very single book, the winter 2-5 degrees wear a little cold. Haha ~ ~"
3,Okay,The fit around the hips is looser than expected. The fabric coloration seems to vary in the wear areas of
1,"Poor quality control ""","Recived very late and damage. I send it back.First : I call Amazon for the late time, they apologize and send it to me next day service and when I open it, surprise "" big damage line on one of the legs."
1,jeans with details of elaboration,"jeans with details of elaboration at the level of the boot is damaged sewing line is placed at the middle of the pants, I'm not satisfied with the product."
5,Great Fit!,"I love the fit of these jeans. They are slightly stonewashed. The price is also very acceptable. It's relatively lighter than regular jeans, which makes it great especially for warmer weathers. I have the blue color. Since finding jeans that fit me perfectly is such a difficult job, I may order them again."
5,They're Jeans,"Don't think anyone needs me to comment on the quality of Levi's Jeans. They were shipped in a timely manner, the price was about the same everywhere on the web and they were as advertised."
1,Mr,I ordered one pair of Levi's and one pair of Wrangler jeans both 34 waist 30 length. The Wranglers fit perfectly but the Levi's had to be at least 36x32 or larger. I thought they couldn't be that mislabeled so I washed them to see if they would shrink. They didn't. I guess thats what I get for ordering clothes on-line instead of trying them on at a store. Thank you for asking. Phil
3,Ok but lightweight denim,"The jeans are pretty good but this style apparently uses -very- lightweight fabric. I've purchased 505 blue jeans at brick and mortar retailers and never have I seen a pair with material this thin. While this may be by design for this style, it concerns me that there was no indication of this attribute in the product description. So be aware that this style ""Blue Collar"" is a very thin fabric. The black pair purchased in the same order were of the weight I am accustomed to in Levi's jeans."
2,poor quality. not made in the usa. not tight fitting,My old levi's 505 are made in the u.s.a. are tight fitting and ready show off my bulge and theses low quality levis are too loose fitting when they should be tight I even have to wear a belt with these 505.
2,wrong size,The first set of jeas were the wrong size but still waiting for the revised size. Should be today or next week.
1,What's happened to Levi's,"I bought a pair of Men's 505 Straight Fit, Blue Collar jeans made by LeviThis is not your father's Levi's, or even mine. Something bad has happened to this brand name. The sizing is all wrong, I had to buy a pair 4 inches smaller than my normal size for it to fit right. The material is thin, flimsy and clearly different than the full, sturdy Levi's of the past. You could buy a pair and were certain that they were indestructible. Now they seem to be made from a fabric that you would make pajamas from.What has happened?Harry Lime"
5,I am wearing them now.,I have worn Levi's all my life. I ordered these to get 1 inch thinner waist. They fit perfect and I am totally pleased.
3,HECHO EN CHINA,"Bueno 20 palabras minimo para describir este jeans es perder un poco de tiempo he comprado varios levis 505 , realmente todos los hechos en paises asiaticos son una verdadera BASURA entodos los espectos solo los hechos en mexico son de buena calidad, favor colocar el pais de procedencia porque no compro mas hasta saber donde son fabricados."
5,excelente,"Excelente quede complacido con el producto, proximamente espero poder seguir realizando compras de este estilo, gracias por todo, Feliz Año"
2,Mas o menos,"Recibido el producto en perfectas condiciones, son rápidos y seguros.No me gusto mucho el diseño y la calidad. Gracias desde Vzla"
3,muy bonito y excelente calidad lo recomiendo,"excelente tela y muy bonito este Levi'S 505 Straight Fit Jean, se lo recomiendo al 100%, el color es bonito la costura es doble"
1,color misleading,"I have been trying to find a pair of Levi's for my husband which are neither blue nor black. The photo of these jeans makes them appear to be brown so I made the mistake of ignoring the color name and assuming they were as pictured. Now he is going to have to wear the ""girlie"" dark blue because it is too much hassle to return."
1,Very Displeased,"I recently bought a pair of 505's for my tall son. The size I ordered was 34 x 36. When they came in the mail the outside of the jeans was labeled correctly, but the inside tag read 34 x 29. I did not notice this until I unfolded the jeans, a day or two after they arrived and unfortunately I have already thrown away the receipt. Good money lost!! How do I get a refund? A quality control person really ought to check sizes before packaging. There is a BIG and obvious difference between a 29"" length and a 36"". Help"
1,decepcionado,"Quise recordar mis tiempos juveniles, pues esta marca de jean era lo máximo en esa época, pero la verdad la horma cambio y ya no los siento como en aquellos días."
1,help from venezuela,I need of tracking product no have my pant send all information pleaseWilmer hernandez wilmersimonhernandez@gmail.comW h s ven
3,The size is bigger...,"I bought a lot levi's jeans, only this one the size is not fit, it's bigger than others although I chosse the same size."
1,Too big,I bought size 40 but this pant it is two sizes biggerIt is not my first Levis but it is my first time with thisproblem with the size.
2,Not what I expected,I just put on a pair of these today for Thanksgiving day. The seam on one leg is crooked and the waist is about an inch too large. I already removed the tags(my mistake) so I gues I'll have to keep them but I won't purchase any more clothing from these people.I should have purchased them from a store like Sears. Live and learn I guess.
4,They Fit!,"Nothing flashy or ornate---basic jeans cut to sit low on the waist and conform to the thigh. Comfortably loose in the leg but not baggy. If you're carrying a little extra padding or you are not fond of a little underwear showing, this cut might not work for you. Otherwise, pretty much everyman jeans."
1,Levi's 505 Straight Fit,"As others have stated, these are not the same ol' Levi's. The fit is terrible, the material is thinner and the quality is nowhere near what you would expect from Levi's. I have started to look at Lee and Wrangler as replacements. Also,Harley Davidson now has a line of jeans that are better quality and better priced ... and since I own two Harley's, it seems like the way to go."
1,Levi's 505,I ordered this pair having worn 505's for years. I didn't keep the return paperwork and put them through the wash. When wearing them the first time I noticed that they are sized bigger than 38 in the waste.I would guess a full inch bigger. I now have add Levi to the don't buy list.
2,Not as pictured,Great fit but did not like the washed out faded look. Description did not state that. I have 505's and they did not look like them.
2,You don't get what you paid for,"I ordered a pair of the 505s for my husband. He is and always has been a 32x32 and always wears the same Levis 505s...First of all, Rigid is not a color, it is an adjective. I have never seen jeans so stiff and uncomfortable. The pair could literally stand up on their own when they arrived. Second, they may be marked 32x32, but they certainly fit like a 34x34.I was hoping to save money, I should have just gone to my local Macys and picked up a pair there. At least he would have a pair of jeans he would actually wear then."
1,Amazon return policy sucks hard,"I tried to cancel the order minutes after buying it because the color wasn't as advertised. It was stonewash jeans (not as dark as it is claimed). I returned the product after I received it with all the labels. Amazon, nevertheless, went ahead to give me only a partial refund. I have since stopped buying items of clothing from Amazon after that."
5,Levi 501 straight leg jeans,"The 501 straight leg jeans for sure shrink more than the 501 orginial stf jeans. Got the black color,they looked dark blue upon inspection. But once washed the black color really came out. Amazon has all the 501 styles,but should take better care to explain the differences. That way people would not get so upset when thay buy relaxed fit 501's,but actually think thay bought orginial fit 501's. Most people either love or hate the Levi 501 series."
5,Jeans,They were exactly what my husband wanted. We knew which jeans he wanted so it was easier to go on line and order than go out to the store and search. As long as I had free shipping it would have been foolish for me to go out.
5,I love these Jeans,"The price was great, the shipping was fast and I love the Jeans. I had some Levi's about 10 years old that I loved the fit on but they were full of holes and finally needed new ones. I took the waist and length size off the old Jeans and reluctantly decided to buy new ones online. After choosing a color I purchased the jeans and when I got them and tried them on they were a perfect fit just like the old ones. They have barely changes after several washings. 5 Stars in my opinion."
2,"Betrayed by an ""Old Friend""","I have worn Levi's for at least 50 years ! I never found any pants to be more comfortable. The last two pair of 505s I bought were so different then the ones that I considered an ""old friend"" over the years. The new ones seemed to feel 'rigid' in the material used. I washed them many times, and they are still not comfortable. Also they are 'baggy' in the thigh area. They seem too loose all around and 'hang' on me. The label said ""Made in Mexico"", so that answered all my questions. I am now searching for another brand after all these years."
1,Wrong Size,Not sure why but the jeans I received were the wrong size.The tag on the jeans said the correct size but for some reason this pair is way off.(I have been wearing the same size for years and have another that fit properly.)No matter how many times I washed them they are still 2-3 sizes too big.Someone put on the wrong tag.
1,Irregular Levi's,"The Levi's were ""irregular."" They do not fit at all like an identical pair I purchased at a retail outlet. Can't understand how they can get away with this. I can't even wear these jeans. A total waste of money. I washed them to see if the fit would improve. Didn't happen. Buyer beware."
1,Not Satisfied Customer,Aweful. One leg was almost 2 inches shorter than the other leg. It was a waste of my time when I thought purchasing online would save me time from going into a store.
3,Levi's 505 Jeans...not the same as the good old days,"Just ordrerd a couple of pair of work jeans as I have for 40 years or more....they're not the same! Much thinner denim, seems like they are already worn out."
3,Try them on!,"I suggest you try on EACH pair, even if they are the same size, as they do not all fit the same."
2,Not what they once were,"The Levi jeans are not what they once were. The denim used doesn't seem to hold up as long as they use to, I find the denim also failing where the belt loops are stitched in. The fake leather patch on the back comes off after a few washes also, didn't this use to be real leather? There use to be 2 additional belt loops as I remember than there are now, I find the belt slipping over the jeans because of this cut back.I am and have been an avid Levi fan, would purchase/wear no other jeans, however, now I find myself looking for a suitable replacement so I can enjoy the quality that Levi once had. The price has gone way up while the quality of the product has seemed to come way down. I am still wearing Levi jeans, but with much disappointment."
2,505's,"Could someone please tell me why Levi's doesn't make ""REGULAR FIT"" jeans anymore?I usually buy Levi's 505's in recent years. But always bought the regular fit size. Now all I see is ""STRAIGHT FIT"" sizing and they're TOO tight! Mostly in the upper leg area and seat. What is all that about? Cost saving measure for Levi's again? As if the jean companies aren't making enough $ already !!I'm reminded of this every time the temperature goes up in the summer time and I'm trying to work in too tight jeans that are hot and uncomfortable to wear and work in !!"
4,True to size,"Fits the same as all of my other Levis,only complaint is the packaging it came in was a little difficult"
2,Not the same quality,"Had purchased from this retailer previously.The previous purchase WAS the original rigid, heavy jeans I had been looking for. This time, however, the jeans were much thinner and had the 'wrinkly' look coming out of the dryer. I will be returning these. This IS a very good retailer, just don't always expect the same quality."
5,Excelent!!!,"Very good in very good quality, very presentable and can be used in countless occasions! this is a purchase that will not be sorry."
1,Worst jeans ever,These may not be the worst jeans I have ever owned but they are way ahead of whatever is in second place. You would think that as much as the charge for jeans now that they could afford to put some belt loops on them. I should have the advise of previous reviews and not purchased these jeans.
3,not a big deal,"i wanted the light stone wash, i got the medium stone wash. I would not have bought these if i was shopping in a store."
3,It's a Levi's jean.,"They fit good, they look good and they are good all year long. I use them with a t shirt or a formal shirt, depending on the occasion."
2,It's true... the fit varies,"So, I tried on a pair of these jeans in a store. They fit great, so I ordered a pair online for a better price. They came, and they did not fit. I ordered one pair of these and one pair of different Levi 505's. Those fit.Who knows why the fit is so variable. You're better off getting a pair in a store."
3,Fine except for the fabric,"The fit was fine. Even the waistband, which some previous buyers complained about because it rides lower on the hips than the traditional cut, was perfectly okay. In fact, I prefer it. But the fabric itself feels nothing like any jeans I have ever purchased before. Very rough to the touch. Almost scratchy. Maybe it will soften over time, but for now, the jeans are uncomfortable on the skin and the texture is like a magnet--brush up against another fabric or use a white napkin and you're covered with lint that's hard to brush off. Was hoping for better."
1,"Poor -- change in fit, loose waist, tight seat","The last two pairs I bought (February 2011) had a very loose waist and a tight seat. I have in the past noted some variation in Levi's sizing from one batch to another -- some are tighter and some are looser -- but the basic shape has always been consistent. These recent jeans are ridiculous. They aren't cut the same way at all. The waist requires a tight belt to stay up, and bunches up under the belt, and the seat is flat and tight. Uncomfortable and unattractive.Levi's needs to fix this or they will lose many customers. I would think that the online outfits like Amazon would pressure them to improve quality control, because people order things online that they are confident will fit. If you can't trust consistency of sizing, folks will have to go to local retailers to try the clothes on first."
1,Huh?,"These are not the Levi's Jeans you were used to. Made in Egypt, very thin cloth, only five belt loops instead of seven. Also, the sizes are not accurate. I love Amazon because they refunded my Levi 505 purchase but I'll never buy from Levi again.Ralph Miller"
1,Levi's,"I ordered 3 pair of jeans, specifying 36X29, because that is the size I wear, and have other Levi jeans of that size that fit perfectly. Although the label indicates that the jeans that I recently purchased are 36X29, they are actually 37X293/4 according to the seamstress who had to alter the jeans. Needless to say, these are now the most expensive jeans I own, but they now are 36X29. I will never order clothing through Amazon again, as it is obvious that Amazon is selling ""rejects"" from the manufacturer."
1,lousy product!,After one washing two of the belt loops have detached. Really poorly made jeans. Very disappointed. Will never order jeans again on line. After this experience will have to see the jeans before purchasing.
3,They don't fit the same,My husband has been wearing 505's forever. They sit lower on him than any of his other jeans. He wears them because it's hard to find 31x36 anywhere. The length was great. I often have to return them because the length is 2-3 inches short.
2,Not what they used to be,"They fit fine and look nice, but they are noticeably thinner or ""lighter weight"" than past purchases I have made of 505 jeans. It's a shame that these once durable jeans are now likely to wear down sooner. I will be searching for more durable jeans in my next purchase."
2,Very disappointed,The quality of the jeans is not the issue. I was not unhappy with the quality. The size is the problem. The jeans were marked 35 waist but clearly are at least a 38. I always wash my husbands jeans before he wears them. By the time I washed the jeans there was no way that I could return them. I really did not notice that they were not the correct size until my husband tried them on. After at least 3 washings in hot water followed by a hot dryer they are still too big. So I am very disappoined.
2,Straight or slim?,"I love Levis and ordered a pair of these as weight lifting had made my slim fit 514 jeans a bit tight, so I figured these are the same cut, just not slim. However, I found these to be equally slim in the thigh. Jean fit is a rather personal thing, so it isn't that these jeans are bad. It is just that they are slimmer than I expect for a 'straight' fit."
3,Levis 501 and 505,"All my previous Levis jeans were 501's size 32. However even now the 501 size 34 is a little too snug. I'm sure after a few washes they'll be too tight. Tried size 36 and they're just too baggy. So I tried the 505's and size 34 fits good. However, I had to wash them a few times to shrink them a little. Bought three pairs- two were okay but for one, the side seams were off. Hard to explain, but when looking down, the outside seam of the left leg comes around to the front of my leg. Very odd looking, looks like I have two right legs. First time I ever had this experience with any pants. From now on I will make sure I inspect my pants more carefully."
1,agree with the others - CRAP,"I thought I just got a bad pair last time I bought these but now I see what the problem was. Also a bit of sticker shock at how much prices seem to have gone up in the last couple of years. Last pair I bought was at a Sam's Club maybe 12-18 months ago for $27. Never minded paying a bit of a premium for Levi's in the past compared to other brands but even if they hadn't changed the cut, I'm not so sure they'd be worth the $40-$50 prices I'm seeing now, especially if they're being made in some offshore sweatshop. I never thought of these as designer jeans; I just liked the quality and fit. Guess the company feels that it's not profitable enough to also cater to the adult market. Good luck to them. As for myself, I think I'll give Wrangler/Lee/Oshkosh another look."
5,Excellent choise!!,"I bought these jeans for my husband and because he is very fussy I was a little bit afraid that he didn't like the gift.And what a big surprise...he loved them, they fitted great and the texture of fabric it's excellent!!!!Definitely I would buy them again."
1,BRING BACK REGULAR FIT,"The ""straight fit"" is complete awfulness -- the pants don't fit in the waist correctly anymore, they don't hold cuffs well. I hunt all over for the remaining regular fit 505s I love, and they are becoming harder to find.The new straight fit is absolutely awful."
2,Levis Disappoint,We were disappointed to find this pair of Levi's 505 significantly bigger than a pair of 505 straight fit we bought last fall for my husband. He is tall and slim (34 Waist 36 Inseam). That is so hard to find so were delighted with the first pair. The new pair required $70.00 alteration to take them in to the measurements of the first pair we bought.
2,"""Made in Lesotho""","I bought black 505's in December 2011 that were made in Mexico. They are great, so I bought another pair. The latest 505's may as well be another brand, they are so different. They are overwashed, really shrunken down and noticeably faded. Poorer stiching as well. I want my new jeans to look NEW. These are ""Made in Lesotho"". Beware."
1,Don't take the chance,I bought 32/34 for my son for Christmas.. He is actually is 30/34 but I bought them bigger to give him a little room. They are about 4 sizes too small. Unfortunately since we washed them before actually trying them on I can't return them..I doubt anyone would be able to fit in them .. Somehow they were mislabeled.. they say made in Haiti?? I will be giving them to good will ..I will never buy these online again..
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"I ordered 3 pair of pants from this seller and got 2 very fast. The 3rd was to be shipped when they got it in, which was fine. HOWEVER...I came home today and found 3 more pairs of pants! I called them to see what happened and they said I placed two orders! I told them I didn't and they HUNG UP ON ME! I called back and went over the while story again and was told AGAIN I placed two orders! I told them their own order slips show TWO DIFFERENT TIMES so there was no way they were both placed by me! They refused to do anything about it! I am now stuck with over $100 of pants I don't need! With as many more options as you have on the internet...go somewhere else or get ripped off!"
4,Levi's,"When we shop at the stores we have not been able to find more than 1 or 2 pairs of Levi's 36X32 at a time;so we thought we would try ordering several (5 pairs) online. I was very disappointed that the Levi's were delivered 1 to 2 pairs at a time over the course of about 5 weeks. I thought the fabric would be more like the old original dark blue rather than the ""washed"" finish."
3,Not true to size.,"I purchased these jeans for my husband. Levis 505 are the only jeans he will wear. They fit in the waist, but the seat and legs are much larger than they are on his other 505s and reaally baggy. He's in his 50's so he's not looking for pants that like they are falling off! We've never run into this with Levis before. Are these seconds?"
5,They're Levi's what more can I say,They fit they are durable. They are levi's dependable quality from one of if not the oldest blue jean company. I was delighted to be able to get my size online.
2,corrigiendo,"Para ser justo debo corregir, que este producto es un buen producto, de buena calidad y precio; pero yo cometi un error pues ya habia comprado el producto, ahora tengo dos y sigo estando satisfecho!!!"
1,505's Ruined,"505 jeans use to be made made by Levi's to fit real mean. Levi's changed the cut of the 505s to now be low riders with skinny little legs. I have personally talked to Levi's Customer Service and basically they don't care about all the old timers that have worn 505s all their lives. There basic answer is that they now are catering to the low rider, pinched honey wearers. Good riddance Levi's! Don't make the mistake of buying any Levi products as they are foreign made and they don't care about what used to be dedicated customers."
5,Levi's 505s,Levi's 505 jeans are just like 501 jeans but with a zipper fly instead of a button fly. They are the standard blue jeans and have been so for decades.
2,"Thin fabric, wrong color","This review concerns two pairs of straight legs which were in the ""Black Amped"" color. I am writing to warn of some problems:(A) Color is a deep indigo blue, not black at all.(B) The jeans come with a big white tag warning the buyer that the jeans will bleed and continue to do so through their life. First time I've seen this.(C) For denim, this is ridiculously thin fabric. The only upside to this is that I could shrink the jeans just enough to save me the usual tailor's bill for altering Levis 32"" inseam to the 31"" they stopped selling years ago.They're nice pants but the wrong color and won't last long."
3,"Comfortable, but VERY oversized","I have worn the same pant size for the last 20 years, give or take. When I got these jeans, they were very, very oversized. I would have needed to order two sizes down in both waist and length for them to fit, even after some warm water and dryer time. Other than the sizing, however, they are comfortable and look nice. I just have to wear a belt with them."
2,Uzipping fly of Jeans,"Use it about one mounth. Always uzipping fly, need to check it. Sometimes it causes severe discomfort, becouse I do not notice it and walk with open ""shop door""!!! So good jeans, but not good fly. Hope it`s happend only with me."
5,Husband's Favorite Levi Jeans from Amazon.com,"My husband loves the 505 Straight Fit Jeans. He needs a 38"" x 29"" size and they are very hard to find locally. We buy all of his jeans from this site and have always been very pleased with the product and the customer service."
5,Levi's 505,"The good price got me to buy as I generally like these jeans. I was a bit nervous about the fit and flaws buying them online. They fit great, quality is what I have come to expect. Look for the sale, these are the real deal!"
5,As good as always,As good as always!... Very confortabl... I have a long experience with these jeans and i can say they are very resistent
2,Paper Thin,"The jeans appear to be real levis, but they are so thin it is like I'm wearing nothing at all. You can see the color of my boxer underneath. It is true it has been a few years since I bought myself a pair of jeans, but holy cow are these thin."
1,Garbage,"I've been wearing Levis for 50 years and I've never seen anything this bad. The fabric is paper thin, the number of belt loops went from seven to five and, as others have said, the rise has been reduced. This pair was made in Bangladesh - perhaps the ones made in Mexico are better. Don't buy these things unseen on-line. I'll keep away from Levis altogether unless I see a pair in a store with decent quality."
2,the size is different from expected!,"Dear Amazon.com,My last order was about two (2) black levis jeans 505/33*30/straight fit. I was surprised that the size did not fit while I am used to wear it in that particular model.Where did that problem come from? I came to the truth that the country where the jeans is made can make a huge difference. The 505/straight fit/33*30 made in Egypt (as those I bought recently)are smaller than Lessotho's which are themselves smaller than Columbia's. I have, you can realize, the same size and model from those countries!That is a very important issue on which Amazon.com should focus. May be you will need in the clothes identification to precise the manufacturer's country.Regards."
3,LEVIS FROM MEXICO,"I BOUGHT A PAIR OF 505 STRIGHT FIT 6 MONTHS AGO. I LIKED THEM, BUT EVEN THOUGH I'M THE SAME SIZE I WAS 20 YRS AGO NO MATTER WHAT TYPE I BUY THEY NO LONGER FIT RIGHT. OK SO I BOUGHT 2 MORE PAIR. THE PAIR I BOUGHT 6 MONTHS AGO ARE ALREADY GETTING HOLES AT THE TOP INSIDE CORNERS OF THE BACK POCKETS. APPARILE :) JEWISH IS BETTER THAN MEXICAN, BUT I LOVE MEXICAN FOOD !"
2,What happened to Levi Quality?,"I purchased these because I thought I could always count on Levis for consistent sizing and quality. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. The pants (33 x 32) are about a size too big and the fabric is much thinner, so I know they won't be lasting as long as the old pairs."
1,Size standards,"I ordered 2 pairs of size 36x34 505 jeans from this listing, and they arrived fine, no problems there.The tag on the jeans say 36x34, but when I put them on the waist is at least two inches larger than advertized, and the inseam is a full four inches larger (compared to an older pair of Levi 505 jeans that I have.I don't consider this seller reliable, at all."
2,Inconsistent Sizing and Quality,"So annoying. I've been wearing Levi's 505 as long as I can recall. The move to overseas production has really hosed up the quality of these jeans, though. And they are terribly, terribly inconsistent. In the most recent instance, I ordered two pairs from the same seller through Amazon, in different colors. What I've noticed over the last few years is that different colors appear to be made by different foreign factories -- some in Mexico, some in China, some in Bangladesh, etc. And depending on where they are made, the weight of the fabric and the actual fit is quite inconsistent. When I order these things, I want/expect them to fit the same way, every color, every time. Not an unreasonable expectation, I think. Levi Strauss was able to achieve this for quite a number of years. Evidently, though, like most other American businesses they have simply ceased to give a rip, opting for comparatively inexpensive labor and compromised quality. Makes me frickin' sad."
1,Plumber's Butt for Everyone!,"If you like to show plumber's butt and sing soprano, the new ""Straight Fit"" Levis 505 are for you.Some genius at Levis replaced the classic ""Regular Fit"" 505's with the terrible 505 ""Straight Fit."" I assure you, there's nothing straight about them. Bad fit. Bad jeans. ...and don't expect any sympathy from Levis inept customer service. They're too busy counting your money."
1,505 fit is awful,"I purchased 4 pair of Levi jeans regular and 2 pair stone washed. None fit like the old 505's I have. They were all about 2 inches larger in the waist and about 2 inches too long in the legs, and the bottom of the zipper is too low in the crotch causing the jeans to poke out like you have two or three pairs f socks in your underware. What a shame for a company that used to be known for providing great fitting jeans. I purchased a new pair of Wranglers and they fit the old 505's. It is a sad day when someone who has been wearing Levi jeans since the early 60's has to start buying Wranglers."
1,Redesigned to fit poorly,"I have purchased Levi's 505 Regular Fit for 35 years. Much to my dismay, the most recent purchase I made turned out to be the newly improved Straight Fit. I couldn't figure out why they kept falling down. When I called Levi's said they would replace the pair I bought with a pair a waist size smaller. They seem to think if my pants are tighter it will keep them from falling off. Since I work in these jeans, moving around constantly, I like some ease of movement within the garment.The redesign from Regular Fit to Straight Fit consists of shortening the rise from the top of the inseam to the waistband. I think it might be shortened as much as 2 or 2.5 inches. This makes it so the pants no longer sit at the waist, slightly above the hip bone which used to keep them from falling off.I am very disappointed in the new pants.My rating is really 0 stars."
1,Not the same 505 jeans!!!,Warning! Levi's changed the cut on it's 505 jeans. Now they are more like hip-huggers. This happened about a year ago.
1,Dissapointed!!!!,"I received these pant I am totally disapointed with Amazon / Levis due to the color is totally different what I expected. I bought one of this pant some time ago and it is the same color of the picture, now I bought the same Ridgid color and it is totally different, it is lighter. Adittionaly the size is incorrect 32x32 looks like 34x34. Return this item is a thurny issue for me.Luis"
4,Perfects Items,"I'm happy with this items, it was according at the information. Its perfect. Thanks a lot."
5,Perfect jeans,"Levi's Men's 505 fit well, are comfortable and very durable. I've been wearing these for years and love them. They look good, too. A great bargain that I highly recommend."
2,Not sure I would purchase Levi's online again,"The jeans I purchased fit very strangely; they were a bit long and the waist wasn't cut right at all. I kept thinking they would shrink a bit in the wash but they haven't. I've purchased 505 Levi's Straight Fit for many years and am familiar with how they should fit. These are not made correctly at all and I don't really like them. I won't purchase these online again for that reason. I purchased online this time because even though I live in the home city for Levi's, I have trouble finding my size as I am at one end of the size range."
3,too long,"Don't know why it came too long eventhough the size shows wht I asked for, first time it happens to me"
2,Thickness,"Hey I love Levis 505 Straight Fit, for the perfect way it sits on me, but for some reason this pair that i just got, not only didn't it sit like all other pairs I have, it also felt different a little thicker than I normally like it. Beside that it's fine, the shipping came earlier than expected so thanks for that!"
5,Break them in!,"It is very difficult to find the rigid, dark denim blue in the stores, that need to be broken in. I got lucky when I found them on Amazon- these are my husband's signature pants that he has worn for at least 35 years (same size too!) They go from formal ""church jeans"" when they are new and wear down to faded, soft casual jeans before turning into holy work jeans before they are retired. They last at least a few years that way, and new pairs are added into the rotation at least 2x a year. The Levis in the department stores tend to be already broken in and don't last as long."
1,Size does not agree with the size,I'm disappointed because I ordered the pants but the size is correct does not match the size that is smaller
2,They don't make them like they used to...,There are other reviews that talk about the various manufacturing areas that Levi's Jeans are made from and the inconsistencies from sweat shop to sweat shop. Well it is true. These fit eh. Not so bad that I'll return them but I am confident this is the last pair of jeans I will buy from Levi's Co.
3,Not comfortable fit. Still trying to find the same fit as my older jeans when there were still made in the US,I'm still trying to find the same fit as my older jeans I purchased when there were still made in the US.Very disappointed!
2,not up to expectation,"These are not the jeans I'm used to. The waist is bigger than it should be. The material is thinner than my older Levis. I'm keeping them because I need jeans, the price was better than in Kohl's and they work, but I wouldn't order these again or recommend them. I'll get used to this fit and expect them to wear out more quickly than they should!"
1,Terrible,"I purchased 36x30 jeans. I have worn Levi's for 50 years. The pair I received said 36x30 - But the actual size must have been 25x30, I could not get them on. Very Dissatisfied!"
1,"New fit, bad fit","I have worn 505's for decades. I recently bought a new pair to find out they have changed the fit. I hate the new low waisted fit! If they are going to change the cut of a pair of jeans, they need to give the new version a different model number. Very bad move on Levi's part. Who's in charge there and what were they thinking?"
3,levi's 505 stonewashed jeans,"A little baggy, and have too much of an appearance of having been worn before, but comfortable. Price was not a big inducement to purchase, but free and reliable shipping and availability were. Finding size 36x36 at under $40 is a huge challenge.Kurt"
2,Fabric very thin,I am very disappointed with these jeans. The fabric is very light. I have been wearing 501s and 505s for years and never seen anything like this. The only reason I am giving them two stars is because I am wearing them. I guess next time I need some new Levis I will need to go to the (shudder) mall where I can touch before I buy.
4,Different than 501,"I usually wear 501 jeans, but tried 505's ~ They are good and different. I need to get used to the extra room in the croach as well as the zipper!"
2,Did not fit,"I've bought several pairs of 31x30 Levi's jeans in the past - including one pair of 505s (though not from Amazon). These were too big by at least a size. I measured them and they were 31"" long from the inseam, and were too wide at the waist and inseam as well. Returned."
2,hard to buy jeans online,"Maybe some people can buy clothes online without trying them on, but for myself, that's proven to be most difficult. These jeans were cut very different than the ones in the store. Be careful."
3,Sizing is good but the material is not,"I bought a pair of these in highland color. The delivery was prompt and sizing was right. However, the material felt flimsy and uncomfortable. Not what they used to be."
1,Please!,"Why would any seller send out an item with the security tag still attached. I emailed them with the problem and got no responce! When I took the pants into a local retailer to have the tag removed, they assumed they were stolen jeans! My advice... buy locally and save yourself the harassment."
4,Levi's 505,fast shipping. Very good fit. Material is not as heavy as other Levi's I have bought. Lower price equals thinner material?
4,blue jeans,"Fast shipment. Overall fit is good, but I was a little disappointed -- the side seams down the legs are a little twisted."
3,Seems like these are low rise jeans even though I didn't order 'Low Rise',I thought these would fit better than they do... They are appro. 3 inches lower on the stomach than your average jeans.... I might end up giving them to Goodwill. They just don't fit like your every day Levis :(
1,Terrible to change design and keep same name,How on earth can you change the design yet keep the same name. Levis 505 jeans are not the same yet the company sells them under the same name....
5,excelente,"bellisimo pantalon, la calidad de la tela es muy buena, el color es exacto a la foto, excelente responsabilidad en el tiempo de entrega"
5,Great Jeans,"I like these jeans, end of story. I been wearing them most of my life. I really like them."
2,size doesn't match the label,I ordered these per the size label on an old pair that have always fit very well. As yet I have not succeeded in shrinking them down to a proper fit .... not a happy camper
4,Levi's 505 men's jeans,Very good quality jeans. Don't like the fact that they have to be ironed after washing/drying. Wrinkle much more than regular jeans that you can wash/dry/fold.
2,not the same,Returned these because my son wanted the Regular fit - these were not it - they aren't the same and didn't fit him high enough in the waist
1,Redesigned to fall off your rear,"The redesign shortens the rise from the top of the inseam to the waistband. I compared them to an older pair of Jeans and it looks like they loss an inch. If you like the way Levi's use to fit, you will now feel like they fall off your rear, and are tight in the crotch. I've worn these for 20 years, and have now switched brands. Bad move Levi's!"
1,My Last Ever Purchase from Levi Strauss,"I was very dissapointed with my new 505 jeans. These are obviously a different design from previous 505's and I am wondering if Levi Strauss could just tell that us before we buy (or give the new design a new number). With this purchase, I have lost all confidence in their abilitty to deliver a consistant product."
2,"Oh well, will know for next time","The jeans above the knee are nice, good quality and fit.The problem is that somewhere ""along the line"" the meaning of ""straight fit"" has changed. It used to mean that you bought a pair of normal jeans. What ""straight fit"" seems to mean now is that if you order this style you'll end up with what closely resembles the ridiculous bell-bottom pant legs from the '70s. So anyone out there looking to order just a ""normal"" pair of jeans go for the slim or regular fit. Btw, the pictures DO NOT show just how '70s the Straight Fit pant legs are."
2,"Must always,try on first.",I will not buy Levi's on line again. The cuts are never the same fit for the same size. But I do like Levi's
4,Very nice fit and look.,"I'm giving these only four stars because these are coniderably longer than any other 38x34 that I have tried. I also have a few others 505 relaxed fit models and these fit differently. They are still very comfortable and nice looking, and for $32 shipped, I think they are an awesome deal."
1,Levis changed the fit,"In the last year or so these jeans were changed from regular fit to straight fit. This new fit appears to be intended for someone with no butt. The rise in back is lower as well. I've been wearing 505's for decades, but when I tried these new jeans on they were instantly uncomfortable. I have returned them for a refund."
1,"Bring back the ""old"" regular 505!","Levi changed their size specs on the traditional 505. The ""straight"" 505s have a shortener rise, and are smaller in the hip and leg. The old style fit my husband perfectly - a no brainer when it came to shopping. The new ""straight"" cut is awful. If Levi wanted to introduce another fit, then why not give it a different number and keep the sizing the same on the tried and true 505. You've lost a customer with this change."
1,They changed,"For the past few months since I bought my new jeans I just thought I was in between sizes. Turns out they changed them. No longer do they work, they just go around your waist like some sort of low cut girl pants. Tightening your belt doesn't really help either. I thought to myself, ""I don't want my pants to change every month on some whim of some designer who thinks they know what's comfortable and what makes me feel like me... I'm going to go with a classic... Levi... If I find the pair that works for me they won't change, they will be here later."" Wrong. Comfort and pants fitting are apparently unimportant. What is important is pandering to a perceived money base who use their jeans for standing around and looking in a way, not for people who have to bend over and lift anything because the new versions fall down."
1,Don't order these jeans,"I read the bad reviews but stubbornly decided to order these jeans anyway (505 tumble rigid 31x32). And, just as others had warned, the size did not match other levi's I own. My simple advice: do not order these jeans. Just go to a store and try them on before ordering.The inside definitely says ""straight fit"" on them, instead of the old ""regular fit"" and, reading over the other reviews, it does seem like levi's has changed their product. I hope it's not impossible to find the old 505s somewhere else!"
3,Christmas gift,This is a Christmas gift. I would appreciate it if you didn't ask these questions until after Christmas. My husband could see the notice and know what he getting for Christmas.
5,Great Fit and Good Comfort,"The jeans were well made, fit great and very comfortable. They didn't need any breaking in. I especially liked how they were packaged for immediate use."
3,Thin,I'm surprised how thin these jeans were compared to some older Levi's I have. The material is skimpier which is a shame. Maybe they should have a line of traditional 505s and charge a little more. I'll now have to look elsewhere for a nice pair of jeans.
4,Great jean,"Fit great, wear great and last. Just enough style to not look like old man pants but not so low they show your crack."
2,Buyer Beware!!!!,The waist on these jeans say 33 but they are as big as a 35. they must be seconds or irregulars.
2,Not Your Daddy's 505s,The new 505 Levi's fit my husband but were tighter than his old ones. The most alarming development is that the fabric is so thin. I can't image these jeans lasting more than a year of moderate wear. Disappointing. I won't be buying Levi's anymore.
2,A little disappointed.,"The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline, an endless abyss. The back label, which supposedly should be leather, now seems to be made &#8203;&#8203;of cardboard and a lousy finish. The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least, in my experience, has been. I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world. Previously, a Levis jeans was a piece ""almost perfect"", today I can not say the same. I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans."
3,Levi's 505 Straight Fit,"I am a Huge Fan of Levi's Jeans, I have worn them every since I was a grade school boy. I am the owner of a numerous pairs of Levi's jeans and actually own several pair of 505 Regular Fit which are great ,but for some reason the Straight Fit 505's did not fit properly. I will still continue to purchase the 505 only in Regular fit."
5,Excelent as usual,My favorite brand for jeans. The best! Great quality! Arrived on time! . . . . . . . .
5,levis 505,"It fits very well and arrived to Venezuela in the correct time, in a good package easy to open. It is made in a really good material and it's absolutely original and perfect I love my brand new jean."
3,LEVI's Slim Jeans,"The fit is almost perfect, except for the length. Could not find Levis Slim 505, 38x29 or 38x28. Tried for several months to get the skinny 38X29 jeans. Why don't they make the 28 or 29 Length? Look and feel of the jeans is very good. I will have to shorten the jeans by taking them to a tailor, just more and more expense. Sometimes not worth the effort. Joe T."
4,Levi's 505 = good,"Good quality, they do seem to fit a little big but are allright. Seem to be regular levi's not as some stated."
4,Great product and excellent services,The product I was looking for was available from Amazon and the trans action went well. The jeans were a perfect fit and the they arrived right on time.Thanks great service.
2,Inconsistent Size,I bought two pair of jeans. One pair fit great. The other pair had legs obviously two inches longer than the other pair.
1,Poor tailoring,"The silt-color ""Levi's 505 Straight Fit Pants"" that I received did not fit like I expected them to. The ""rise"" measured from the crotch to the top is 1-1/2 inches shorter than traditional Levis 505 pants. As a result, they fit like ""low rise"" style pants, not like the 505 Levis that I have purchased in the past. Also, the upper front fabric is excessively wavy when the pants lay empty, flat on a table. They remain so when wearing the pants, unlike the pants shown in the photo. Properly tailored pants would lay flat."
5,old standard,Been wearing this type for around 40 years. They are an old favorite. It is hard to believe how expensive they have gotten.
1,Cheap Junk,"What has happened to Levi's? Very thin material, have had several rip on the seam of the back pocket in less than 6 months. Even before they ripped, when I went outside on a cold day, it seemed to offer no warmth in the back end, like it had already ripped, but it had not yet. Not much luck with Wrangler either. I guess if you want good jeans nowadays, you have to pay up bigtime. These are not even close to acceptable. Prepare to be disappointed."
4,run small,I ordered a 31/29 pair. they were way too tight. exchanged for 32/30 (they don't make a 32/29) and they're better. I'm hoping they'll give a little with time. out of the box these black denim pants are much stiffer than the stone washed blue Levi's which fit me nicely in the 31/29 size.
3,jeans are ill fitting in the seat,"The jeans look and feel good,except for the waist, which droops below the waistline and exposes my underwear. The size is correct, but the seat of the pants, do not offer any snugness as my other leans(same size) do. I must wear a belt and pull it very tightly around my waist just to keep these jeans from drooping so much in the seat. I'm very disappointed with them.and will never buy another pair of these expensive pants."
2,Not Regular Fit Any More,The last purchase of these jeans was for something called regular fit. They are called something else now but the tag does not say what it is. The fit is lower on the hips. The material is also noticeably thinner so I doubt they will last as long.
3,You need to have shorter inseam lengths for those of who at a little shorter.,"You need to have pants with a little shorter in seams. At least 28 inches if not shorter. I have to pay get them shortened, which adds a lot to the cost of the pants.The comment goes for all the Levi's I ordered"
1,"The inconsistency is laughable, or not.","I bought 3 pairs. 2 size 30x32 -- rigid and tumbled rigid, 1 size 31x32 tumbled rigid.The rigid pair fits much larger than the tumbled rigid, even though they are tagged the same size. MUCH larger, like two sizes larger. The 31x32 tumbled rigid are made in egypt, had root beer or something sticky inside the bag, had a bent zipper, and are 2 inches SHORTER than the same style in 30x32.I think levi's is way too big to have any kind of real quality control. I'd rather just pay > $100 and get a nice pair of selvedge denim I'll have for years to come."
1,What Happened to Levi's?,"Levi's denim is so thin now, they tear at the crotch given the slightest stress. They look nice. Just don't jump, squat, climb, run fast, leap, dance, ride a bike, or any other physical activity. I thought I had gotten a defective pair, but four pairs from different stores tore in the exact same place in less than a month of wear. Such a shame for what was once a great product. I'll stick to Wranglers which don't look nearly as good as Levi's but they last forever at half the cost."
1,Richard,"The denim material is fine but the pants have too few belt loops, which causes the pants to sag in the back when you wear them."
3,I won't by Levi again,"I've been buying Levi's since before they were $5 a pair.........that's a long time. These 505's are cut different and are made of a lighter weight material, plus they are no longer made in America. Shame on Levi. Levi has lost a loyal customer by cheapening their product yet charging premium prices. I found that I can buy other name brand jeans for a third the cost of Levi's that are of similar quality and fit better. I'll not buy Levi's again."
1,Not the same ol' 505's,"Sad day when a pair of ""classic"" Levi 505's are the most uncomfortable pair of jeans I've ever owned.Not sure why the company just couldn't come up with a different number for these new low rider jeans and leave the 505's alone. I've worn no other jeans since the 70's, but unfortunately it looks like I have to move on to some other brand."
2,Levi's Men's 505s,"Agree with the other reviewers who criticize the way they fit (don't fit) at the waist. While they feel and generally fit like quality Levis,they are more low-rise than I expected or like and I am constantly pulling them up.."
3,Inconsistent,"Bought 2 pairs in the same size but different colors. One pair had the original rise, while the other was a super low rise. They're the same style, so why are they styled differently? Get it together, Levi's."
4,wacky sizes,"levi's are levi's. after reading some reviewers complaining of inconsistencies in the sizes, i thought that was rare. but my pair from amazon were at least an inch longer and the waist felt a bit off also. i have always bought and wear 34 x 34 but usually get em on sale at penneys or such and they have always been the same til now.and as other reviewers point out, denim is getting thinner. other than that, fine jeans."
3,quality control is going downhill,"perhaps it is a sign of the times, but the quality of the Levi's jeans continues to decline. the seams that run vertically on the outside of each leg, cross over 3/4 of the way up the leg. by this i mean the front side is on top and then it switches to where the back side is on top. i also noticed that at some point they when from 7 belt loops to 5."
2,Poor quality at best.,"The belt is attached to the buckle by two tiny screws. One of them fell off a month after the belt was bought, rendering the whole thing almost useless. A little later the paint on the buckle started to chip away, exposing the true color (brass) of the buckle, giving an uncomplimentary look. Definitely would not recommend it."
1,Failure in sending,"What about this product?I bought the May 12th and I have not received, and I have not received the 6th of June.Also I have not received any message from the cause of the delay"
5,Product exactly like shown!,I bought these jeans for my husband. The Jeans fit well and the style is current. Good buy for the price.
4,Recommend purchasing,"Trousers after more satisfied with the hand try it on thick material can be reliably against general low temperature. The only doubt is relative to I bought a before 511, also is 30 * 30 why this one leg was a bit longer, although not in effect, but to my future purchase brings some trouble."
3,Not what they used to be.,"As mentioned above, the cut is different: lower waist, and I think wider legs. An old guy like me is reduced to buying the button fly from now on. Maybe it will keep me agile. What is this world coming to? I thought Levi's were forever!"
4,Envio Rapido,"esta bueno el envio, en tiempo y forma. el producto llego bien embalado y perfectas condiciones. altamente recomendable para cualquier comprador novato que quiera adquirir los productos de Amazon"
4,Men's jeans rock,"I've worn men's jeans for a long time. They are made better and fit me better than women's. The last pair was made in Egypt and were good, the pair before we're not very good at all. I looked at the Levi web site and to get jeans from them that are made in the USA cost $$$ more than jeans made elsewhere. It's too bad that we can't get garments made in our country and made well without going into hock!"
1,made in cambodia,i bought this pair of jeans. im from malaysia. to my suprise the jeans was made in cambodia with lowest level of quality. i cant return because the cost involved is even more than the cost of the jean. i learned tht i shouldnt be naive and trust big brands for highest level of quality. my honest review. please publish.
5,"Levi's Men's 505 Straight Fit Jean, Dark Stonewash, 32x32","I have for the first time ordered jeans in shop online. I was afraid that they won't arrive more close at size. But alarms were vain. Has bought the size 32. Jeans have sat down well, a dense fabric. Color of jeans was very pleasant to the son."
3,needs quality control,The cut of the 505s is fairly simple and I would agree that it is a true straight cut. When i first opened the packaged they reminded me of my old 529 which are unfortunately no longer on the product line. The fit of the jeans is good depending on sizing though. I ordered one 32 waist and two 34 waist and the amount of variance in sizes is amazing. One of the 34s ran small and the other ran big. The bigger of the two seemed like almost a 36 and the smaller of the two was almost 2 inches different. Not to mention that one of the jeans was mislabeled as 32x34 but was actually a 34x32 according to both the inside tag and the brown tag on the back waistband. You better order a few and play with the sizes to find something that works. I really liked the look and feel of the tumbled rigid but the silver fox color has a very thin and cheap feeling material. I wouldn't recommend those. I already have a gray 501 that is much better looking.
3,Color,"The color is different , not the gas color I was looking. Anyways do far so good the feel Is typical Levi's and which makes the deal three star."
1,Problem with the size,"I bought the Levi `s 505 36x34 and 2 pairs of jeans Levi` s 36x34. But the 505 model has proved to be larger than the waist and 2 ""longer than the other two, I am very disappointed. I do not trust online buying Levi` s"
2,design flaw,"I appreciate the fact that this makes 8 popsicles but the flaw is in the design. The ""dribble"" base when tilted to take a bite, pours the melted liquid out onto clothes, rug, etc.Stains. Too bad!"
4,They're fun for adults too.,"I bought these molds for my Crystal Light drinks so that I could have a more nutritious dessert option. The molds are quite long so you get a very nice sized popsicle for your money. The plastic is a bit on the thin side so the popsicles were a bit hard to get out as they were hard and the plastic is pliable. Make sure to really mix your liquid as it can settle in the very bottom, impossible to get back out, and the taste will go with it. I have fun using these and they were reasonably priced."
2,"waste, broken right away because it didn't work correctly","Sure this is a good value if the things served a purpose, but the first time I made popsicles they wouldn't come out of the mold- I had to smack em around a bunch and ended up breaking one of the molds. Too easy to lose sticks as well. Didn't function well at all and a complete waste of my money given the fact that I had to throw them in the trash ! I think I ended up with one decent Popsicle after my second try but realized it's not worth the effort or the mess- the drip guards do leak everywhere. Disappointing."
2,Guess it's not what I had hoped for...,"I bought this book because it was the only affordable bird book of Japan that I could afford. I guess that I was expecting a bird guide that helped me identify species etc., something like a field guide. This is not such a book. If you already have identification books, or are already able to identify east asian birds, then this book will tell you the hot spots and help you plan a birding trip. It's got maps, useful vocab, and lots of other information about the surrounding areas of some good birding locations. Just don't expect any help with identification.Since I don't get to travel a lot, I don't think I'll ever get a chance to use this book, and I'm still at a loss when it comes to identifying local birds."
1,A bulls--t book,With all the noise about Romney and Huntsman I searched for a thoughtful short book that would explain Mormon theology and history. Most I saw were obviously hostile. I was looking for something perhaps more balanced. The authors' credentials suggested this might be a good one. Instead I got a fluffy PR piece. Deeply disappointed.
2,Not just a history,"The authors did a reasonable job, the book is organized and readable, they just shouldn't have presented their expository as an objective history. It is simply an LDS primer with historical context. This book is not balanced and objective. While it does point out the controversies surrounding the religion, it tends to slide right on by rather than really address those issues. The preface actually points out the real purpose of the book, ""The aim of this book is to explain how Mormons feel about their religion and how they hold on to their faith in the modern era."" With that the real purpose, the subtitle, ""A History..."" should have been left off."
5,Great read for any woman...,I have been a reader of Erin J. Shea's Lose the Buddha blog. I had to get this book. I cried & laughed and everything in between. This is a great book for any woman who has ever had a struggle with her weight....
1,Worst diet book I've ever read,"I have read hundreds of diet books--but honestly this one is the WORST one EVER!!! It was so depressing that I had to quit reading it!!! REALLY!!! I ordered ""THE OVERFED HEAD"" by Rob Stevens at the same time and it was THE BEST DIET BOOK I've ever read!!! -- thanks to Rob -- it may be the LAST DIET BOOK I'LL EVER READ!!! Take my advise and buy his book -- he gives great advise!!! Rob was on a diet for 25 years, but when he STOPPED DIETING -- he lost 150 lbs!!! -- proving diets don't work!!! The only thing you LOSE on a diet is the money you spent on the diet!!! -- because the weight always comes back -- plus more!!! Mary"
4,"Edmund Spillers/WROU-FM Dayton, Ohio",Dr. Logan has brought to light what many people did not know about a mid-size city in Ohio named Dayton and the legends in music that have changed american culture.
4,Interesting Life,The author has shared with us his very interesting life. It made the book one I had to read to the very end.
3,The adventure's just getting started,This book keeps you on your toes. As the 2nd book in Janelle Taylor's 9 book series you can tell that the adventure is just beginning.
5,Battle,"Every battle you ever heard of, and more! This is a very detailed book and the illustrations are not only helpful but instructive. Well written."
5,Great book,"I am a elementary school librarian and this book is great. It gives small snippets of information about every major battle in recorded history. I have a student who hates to read who begs me to let him have this book. It's colorful with lots of illustrations, maps and pictures. All in all, I would definitely recommend this book!"
4,Excellent collectors item,My 15yo son wanted this book and I couldn't find it anywhere. Amazon came through with a good price and free shipping
3,illustrated but too vague for serious historians,"While the book should be praised for its visual feat, the historical details tend to be grossly generalised with debatable nitty-gritty details in almost every page.Comparable perhaps to Hollywood historical films, produced with veild agenda and full of ambiguous suggestions often taken as fact by the naive.The strong point of the book is undoubtly its varied and extensive illustrations (which is quite enjoyable to go through), the history ('His'- 'Story') itself is extremly eurocentric and biased in many ways.Will be useful for those whom want to improve general knowledge on military history, but not to be used for serious references."
4,Amazing Visual Adventure,"I just got this book and I must say It's great. It provides a excellent visual adventure into the history of battle and warfare. Although the infomation might be a vague, I highly recommend this book to anyone who is intrested in learning a bit more about Military History with high visual aid. Overall I give it a 7/10"
3,Not the worst Bigfoot flick,"It's corny, slow in some parts, the music is annoying, but the creep factor is pretty good if you're alone and it's 2 AM. Of all the Bigfoot movies, it's in the top 20 somewhere."
3,"Cute, frothy entertainment.","This is basically an after-school special in novel form. Well, make that novella form. It's only 150 pages.The three main characters spend all their time hanging around at the local park, wandering aimlessly through their town, sighing dramatically about how incredibly bored they are. True to life? Sure. Interesting? No.The protagonist is a bored, sort of passive-agressive girl named Aurin who has a crush on a girl named Neila. (The author apparently has a fondness for weird names.) Her moody, attention-grabbing friend Kenney is jealous of the time she spends with Neila. It's never really explained why. Aurin resents Kenney, but that is never really gone into in depth. NOTHING in this book is gone into in any depth. It's a quick, superficial skim into the pool of teenager-hood."
3,"comprehensive, but poorly written","Electron paramagnetic resonance is a fairly complicated experimental technique, and the task of writing a textbook on this method is extremely challenging. This particular book is written by experienced scientists and covers all major modifications of EPR, as well as extensive bibliography. However, the presentation of the material could be much, much better. I found it very hard to follow the authors mostly because the systematics in presentation, from full explanation of simple things to more complicated ones, is lacking almost completely. Sometimes I even had a strange feeling that subsections of the book were written independently and were just put next to each other in the final manuscript, so different is their writing style, and so weakly they are related to each other. Unfortunately, there are not so many books on EPR published recently which are available at bookstores, so the readers do not have a lot of choice..."
5,Excellent Customer Service,"We ordered two shirts for our Halloween costumes and when they arrived, we noticed one was the incorrect size. We emailed customer service to let them know the problem, they responded quickly and were very helpful. They let us keep the incorrect size and shipped us the correct one, free of charge, the very next day! The shirts are great quality and we definitely recommend them!!"
1,Simmons Beautyrest Mattress Makeover White Europa Queen Mattress P,I had to send it back. It was coated with Chemical (Teflon)and the Amazon description did not mentioned it. Amazon was very good and cooperative in return and crediting my account
4,"Mary,Mary Mary.","My seven year old is enjoying this, though some of the concepts are a little dated for her."
4,we love Mary!,Mary Poppins is a magical nanny that lives with the Banks Family. These books are all about her adventures with the kids. These adventures were made into a movie and now are being preformed on Broadway. If you can't make it to New York to see the play read this book. It's the next best thing!This books contains two of the Mary Poppins series of books in one volume!After reading these two kids are sure to want to read the rest of the series!
3,What was that?,"If you have read the reviews for this book you know you either love it or hate it. I didn't hate it but it is definitely not one of the better anthologys. The premise of dreams should tell you most of these are somewhat surreal. Now fantasy I love, but all three tales are alittle over the top.Sherrily Kenyon's reminded me somewhat of Fantasy Lover until I think she lost her way and had to improvise the end. I was disappointed, most of her stories are stand alone good.Rebecca York's tale of lovers parted by evil was better and I liked the physic connection.Robin Owens tale was good too. Not great as we expect from her but interesting. I just found the fact that they remembered their previous death and visit to (?) heaven, was alittle to easy for them.This book is not worth what it costs. Wait until you can borrow it or buy a used copy. This is just my opinion."
2,Buy this for Ms. Kenyon's story,I should know better by now than to buy this type of book--3 stories by authors with a similar theme. Ms. Kenyon is an automatic purchase for me and i did enjoy her story the most. The other 2 just did not hold my interest...I had not read anything by either author before. Be forewarned.....
2,what dreams may come,i was disapointed. two of my favorite authors wrote stories in this book and they had very short stories that could easily been longer and more indepth. the other two stories were longer but didn't have the umph the others had. for what i paid i would have thought to get a awsome book but instead i reiceved a book that was soso.
1,Dreams on hold......,I was surprised to see three great writers deliver such boring material. I would like to say something nice but this book was a bomb. If it helps at all the cover was hot.
3,Not to much to say.,"Read this collection of short stories, if you want a quick and easy read. Don't expect much and you will not be disappointed. And besides I only purchased it to read the Sherrily Kenyon short story, so I was not THAT disappointed."
2,Does anyone know how to write a short story anymore?,"I like all of these authors' works. I would even say that Kenyon and Owens are on my ""must buy"" list when their new books come out. However, I was disappointed to spend this much money on this little content. Minimal plots, and in Owens' case, rehashing of previous ideas (from her ""Heart"" series -- Fam cats)led to, at best, an OK read, and at worst, just plain confusing or boring reading. I suggest borrowing the book from a friend or library and save your money for the authors' next novels. I will admit that I may be a harsher critic than most; I'm a fast reader and I've read so many books (romance, horror, fantasy, science fiction, nonfiction, etc.)over the years that my tolerance toward an average to below-average read has flagged recently."
3,What Dreams May Come,"I find this book reminds me of early romance novels where to heroines find their ""knight in shinning armor"". The conflict is more about creating a relationship while outside influences are coming between the couples. It is a nice easy read for those days when you just want to just have a quiet evening of relaxation."
1,Quantity doesn't equal quality,"If the sign of a good book is having lots of pages, I'm sure that this would be the best sales book on the market. But it's not a good book. Not even close.The content is valuable, but it's poorly organized. If I followed Brian Tracy's advice on Pareto's Law, then I'd be frustrated looking for the 20% of the content that is actually useful. This is Brian's worst sales book by far, and not a book I would recommend to anyone, let alone someone just starting out in sales.It would be a better book if he cut the fluff by 75% and got to the point. Instead of ""Advanced Selling Strategies"", pick up ""Be a Sales Superstar: 21 Great Ways to Sell More, Faster, Easier in Tough Markets"" by the same author. The content is almost identical, and a much easier read."
3,Surely not advanced...,Didn't learn much and I'm not someone who's been to seminars. Most of this is common sense and truthfully...a lot of it would work on a feeble minded 5 year old. There is some solid stuff in here but nothing earth shattering.
5,Everything Taboo,"When I was in New York last December I passed the theater where Taboo was playing and I was like, I really don't want to see this. So instead I saw Little shop of Horrors. Boy and I kicking myself now. What a GREAT score. It has some of the most moving music I have ever heard. ""Talk Amongst Yourselves"" is so beautiful and I love Liz McCartney ever since Dance of the Vampires. ""Love Is A Question Mark"" and ""Stranger In This World."" Another great song is ""I'll Have You All."" So funny so true so... well never mind. Even for those of you that do not like musicals this show doesn't have your typical Broadway sound. You MUST buy this CD. I said so."
5,A Masterpiece!,"TABOO was an amazing show that got an unfair bum-rap because the press wanted to rag on Rosie O'Donnell for (god forbid) trying to branch out into something else. But ask anyone that saw the show and they will tell you that it was absolutley amazing and that it was a wonderful piece of theater that truly touched your heart. The Cast of the show was an amazingly talented bunch of artists and Boy George's score is perfectly well rounded with fun up tempo numbers and heart wrenching ballads. I suggest you forget everything negative you have heard about this show (because most of it was all wrong and completley unfair) and buy this album and give it a listen. You won't be dissapointed, I promise."
3,Track names messed up,"What are the real song names, and who sings them? No. 2 is not ""Safe in the City,"" for instance. I bought the MP3s and started listening to the show, only to find that the names didn't line up. Amazon has most of the titles screwed up, which makes me think the singers are also screwed up. And iTunes or Google don't clarify anything. They either copy what Amazon has or else list ""Boy George"" for every song."
3,Well...,"I feel that this musical would have shined more if ""Headwig..."" had not come before it. Though I think the score has major up points, the lyrics sometimes have a lot to be desired. Though it is not one of my favorites, I would reccomend it to you because the up points are definitly up.Best song: Stranger in This World"
5,A Monumental Broadway Production,"I don't want to gush too much, but listening to the new Broadway recording last night, it was like seeing the show live again. The highlights include Euan Morton's haunting Stranger In This World (this should be released as a single) and beautiful Pretty Lies; Raul Esparza's heartbreaking Petrified; Liz McCartney's showstopper Talk Amongst Yourselves (Brooke Elliott did a terrific job when McCartney was out on maternity leave!). You get 21 songs here, I'm sure you'll agree with me that Boy George is a genius, the music is amazing, touching and beautiful one moment and rugged rock and roll the next. I still wonder why this show did not catch on, I saw it five times and loved it more each time. Lastly, for all of his 1980's success, I think Boy George's material really shines here...I'm not sure if I have or will ever see another Broadway musical that moved me or the audience this much, it got a standing ovation for every performance."
4,Everything Taboo!,"Excellent recording captures the feel of the show better than the London recording, as it includes bits of dialogue and is performed in the same style as on stage. BUT, I prefer the London recording as an album to listen to,it's pop-music formula is more to my taste, more fun to sing along with. There's something about the Broadway cast recording that just doesn't seem as inviting- maybe it's a little over the top? And why shouldn't it be? It deserves a Tony, nevertheless, but you if you can't decide which csat recoding to buy, and don't want to buy both, I'd go for the London recording instead. The fabulous ""Touched By The Hand Of Cool"" didn't make it to Broadway, and is probably the best song from the entire score. Aw, who am I kidding? Buy them both! You know you want to!"
2,"Fine phone, but speaker feature has issues","The phone has been fine for me. And, the speaker phone is fine in that you can hear the person you are calling well. However, if the person you are calling wants to hear you using the speaker, you have to raise your voice and put your mouth practically on the phone, which defeats the use of the speaker option."
2,Fred,"We were misled by other reviews of this product. While it does have the features claimed, the fidelity of the message system (digital, ie not the old fashioned analog tape style) is barely acceptable. We've had several who know us claim that our greeting/announcement sounds nothing at all like us. The messages others leave for us have been similarly garbled. The kicker (and not anticipated) is that, while the phone does work in the absence of power, there is a very annoying hum present. We specifically purchased a corded line to ensure the best sound possible (our previous corded phone gave us just that, but it is no longer made. Btw the analog tape message system provided TONS more clarity). This phone does only marginally better than our cordless, and the sound is pretty stinky when the power goes out. Not a good product, in our view."
2,LCD Display Failure,"Everything on this phone is fine, though I can't comment on the digital answering component on this model because I use my telephone service provider's voicemail. However, eight months into use the LCD display is no longer legible. There are huge gaps in the print and, of course, what passes for ""service"" at Panasonic was unhelpful. If anyone has a suggestion for how to cure this LCD failure,I'd be most grateful."
1,No LCD Light !!!!!,"I bought this for my parents (elderly couple) for a gift. Set it all up, everything was working as expected. Only one problem, they could not read the LCD screen. Contrast did not light it up enough. This unit would have fit perfect if it only had a light."
3,You have to buy the ac adapter separately,"I like the phone, it is functional, but it is a shame it does not come with the adapter plug. It does not have the option of using batteries either. It will cost an extra $10-$15 to buy the adapter separately, and most stores do not carry a 6 volt adapter. You are forced to buy it online, and wait another week to be able to use the functions on it ."
1,Not even 8 months later...,"The phone is unusable. It won't hang up. The only way to end a call is to disconnect it from the wall. It has other drawbacks such as the unreadable display and the less-than-crystal-clear message quality, but we could get along with those. A waste of time and money."
4,Well Pleased,"The phone looks great, works well, and overall I am well pleased. If I was tolist one complaint it would be the lack of backlighting on the screen. At nightit is almost impossible to see. Other than that I am well pleased."
4,Old Cassette Answering Machine Replacement,"This phone is a reasonable replacement for my 20+ yrs. old Panasonic answering machine phone. The sound quality is a bit tin-like, but it is the closest thing to my old unit that had cassette tapes in it. The machine is very lightweight and takes up less space. Not sure how long this one will last since it is not as durable, but it does what I need for the price."
4,Panasonic KX-TS620B,"So far, it is exactly what I was looking for. The answering system is much better than that on my old phone. I plan to keep the owner's manual handy for instructions on how to use some of the features which I seldom use."
3,LCD Display Malfunctioned after less than one year,"I am very disappointed with the Panasonic KX-TS620 telephone. I purchased this telephone less than a year ago and the LCD display no longer works. All the characters in the display are broken up and completely unreadable. I subscribe to Caller ID, but now I cannot tell who is calling because the LCD display is unreadable. I am shopping around for another telephone. Anything but Panasonic..."
5,Panasonic phone,"I just realized I ordered black, but got white...not that it made that much difference, but black would have been nice on my desk. As for the phone, I like the features, which are easy to operate. I purchased caller ID, which really comes in handy on a business phone. Keeps track for me, and I can add them to the phonebook. I have a hard time hearing on most phones, and found this one to have good sound quality.I can hear better than most. Sometimes the volume is actually too loud for me. Like the speaker phone and mute feature...good for call in meetings. Good phone for work at home (WAH) business, telecommuter, or someone who just needs a land line without the wireless feature. Perfect for me. Have recommended it to fellow WAH staff."
3,Nice office phone but....,I use this phone in my office. It has good voice quality. The answering machine is easy to program and use but.... althought it has a port labeled data for a fax machine I have been unsuccessful in my attemts to make it work properly with my Canon MX 850 Fax machine
4,Good buy,I wanted a combination speakerphone and answering machine to save space on my desk. This phone performs all its functions well. It has nice large easy to read buttons and good volume on the speaker phone. I'm happy with it and think it's a good value for the money.
5,A good office phone,"This phone replaced one whose brand name was licensed from a big phone company. I found its speakerphone useless because it cut off soft voices, common when the other side was also on a speakerphone. The Panasonic is far superior; now I can participate in big conference calls with my hands really free. I also has a handy call duration display, useful in my billable-hours work. Overall the whole thing just feels well thought out, while the other one felt like a rush job in need of new firmware. Slight nit: It would be nice if the answering machine's remote access code were more than two digits long."
3,Panasonic phone review,"Although panasonic makes the best phones, there are 3 problems with this particular model. Firstly, there is no battery backup, so if the electricity goes off, all the memory is lost. Second, it is almost impossible to read the lcd readout for caller id, as it is black on black. And third, there is no option for raising and lowering the voice volume, which is way too loud."
2,Disappointing sound quality,"When the tape recorder on our old reliable Panasonic phone died, I replaced it with this new all-digital model because of Panasonic's reputation and since few manufacturers make basic corded phones any longer. Unfortunately, the sound quality is poor and when someone is on another phone at the same time, its volume drops off considerably and cannot be increased. Another annoyance is that it has no back-up battery so that the clock must be reset if there's a power interruption - unless you also have CallerID. The answering machine is simple to use."
2,"No conf call capability, no answerer for the 2nd line, no choice of ringers","The description lists 3-way conf call; which it does nto have. I called Panasonic and they confirmed this.There is no choice of ringers, which is strange.There is no answering machine capability for the 2nd line. I needed to activate home voice mail on my home line which defeated the purpose of having an answering machine.Also, if you have the headset plugged in, you HAVE to use the headset. You can't answer the phone by picking up the handset.A lot of details were missed on this unit."
3,answer machine,"good enough, wish the volume for the message could be made louder. also, position of flashing light indicating message not great....have to be really close to machine to see if you have a message"
1,"In my opinion, this product is absolute garbage","Immediately after plugging in the phone, I found out the speaker phone did not work.I would never buy another phone from Panasonic again.I think this product is pure garbage.I think Customer Service at Panasonic is useless."
2,Wish I had known,"The answering maching is garbled until I replay the message. Since this was a purchase from a thrid party vendor rather than directly from Panasonic, it is unclear whether I purchased a second hand unit is malfunctioning. DO you know if i have a warranty opf any sort on this purchase?Otherwise, the phone is meeting my specs if only it worked properly.Next time I will purchase through the vendor, where I did all my research and know I have recourse."
1,Only 10 days to return,"The phone was fine, but be aware that you will have only 10 days to install and test it. After that you can't return it!I continue to be very frustrated by internet return policies. Unless you are absolutely sure about the product and merchant, save youself the trouble and buy local!"
3,LCD defficient,"For a premium priced unit with unique electronic features, odd the lcd is both small and has no backlight, exacerbated by having a colored background. Also lies at a flat angle impossible to see from across a desk. Pretty much offsets advantages."
3,panasonic KX-TS6220B corded phone,Caller ID screen is too small.Get an echo when listening to incoming messages makes it hard to understand them.
1,big disappointment,"Very short cord on the handset, I keep knocking it off of the desk when I try to answer it, the cord doesn't stretch far enough. I've recorded my greeting at least five times and everyone says that it's not loud enough to hear. the amount of missed calls doesn't delete so that when you check, you don't know if you missed any or not. I guess I could write down the number on the set and then see if it increased, but I think that would be annoying after a while. There doesn't seem to be any volume control on incoming calls, if someone is talking very loud you just have to endure it. I find this very cheaply made, with a lot of features that I won't use and a lot of problems with the features that I will."
2,Sounded interesting; very disappointed,"How interesting - a six foot tall, slightly clumsy woman and the rake who loved her. Started out good but just could not get into it. The characters did not impress me. Jon Sterling, I felt, pointedly kept harassing ""Andy"" with unwanted attention. I think he should have taken her ""no"" for an answer. Not that it was anything more than kisses-- but I kept wishing he would just leave her alone a while.The rest of the story, even the side romances of others did not capture my attention. I was very disappointed because ""Andy"" sounded like she would be a wonderful heroine but the story did not pan out."
1,"Cheap Clutch, lasted one day of use","I have had this drill in the closet for three years before I took it out of the box and used it to install a shelf in a closet. After a half hour of use, the clutch was stripped and I now have to send it back to Hitachi. I expected much higher quality but I guess this one is made for very light duty use."
3,"Great Tool, but not for everyday use","I have to say I really loved this tool at first. Light weight with just the right set of features (ok, the LED is near worhtless). I never used it for heavy duty usage such as building a deck, but it did get used nearly everyday for light duty tasks and in that role it was ideal. I bought a second tool because I liked the first one so much, but within 6 months both tools were having problems. One of them developed a sticky ON switch. The other developed a problem with the hi/lo speed switch - I would set it to hi speed and it would pop out while screwing."
3,Love at first site,"When I first bought it I was thrilled,so much I bought 2 more.I got them reconditioned for $50.00 which was a bargain.It was the first driver I had with a LED which was very helpful.I use it for work,removing screws in appliances.The high speed 600RPM is great and the Battery lasts a long time.Eventually I was less impressed though.Out of the 3 I bought,I had to fix 2 of them for pinched wires inside,and 2 of the 3 LED's stopped working."
2,Great Product Unless You Need Warranty Service,"I bought this tool 4 years ago and it has worked great. Being in the electronics repair business, I use it quite a bit. All of a sudden it stopped running clockwise; only counter-clockwise. I could only UN-SCREW; no SCREWING possible. I am not near a Hitachi service center so I checked the website, emailed & called Hitachi customer service several times. No answers. The tool comes with a 5 year warranty. I am totally frustrated and if they don't answer me soon I will never buy another Hitachi tool again."
2,Disappointed,"I've had this screwdriver for a little over 2 weeks and it's failed already! Out of the blue, there's some internal failure, either with the clutch mechanism or the internal gearing. When I try to use it, it just grinds away.I've contacted Hitachi customer service for a replacement. I hope the replacement will be better than this one."
2,Interesting product but a problem for left handers,"I purchased this product for my wife, since it appears to provide a lot of flexibility in a small and light form factor. Thus my wife doesn't need my 18v DeWalt. When we opened it and looked at it, the tool is clearly a right handed tool, based on the position of the on switch. A left hander cannot manipulate it. I contact Hitachi and they said that's all they have. We did not use the tool so it might be good if you're right handed."
2,just OK,"Used for 2-3 years, trigger began to wear out. Just dropped it today from 3 feet on concrete now forward trigger doesn't work. Always felt a bit clunky and the design looks like a mexican wrestler mask. Buying a Makita DF010DSE today to replace it."
2,No Power...,"You can't drive much with this drill, certainly no woodscrews or drywall screws.The controls are awkwardly placed and the light is a joke.It's really only good for working inside a PC or other light gear with machine screws and threaded nuts/metal.I got it for free with the purchase of a Hitachi 18V drill, so I guess I can't complain too much."
3,"Too Fast, and Won't 'Carry' second tip","I've owned several cordless drivers, and sorry, but considering the 4.5 star rating, two ""negatives"" immediately jumped at me.1- Low speed isn't low enough. imo, it needs to be 180 rpm MAX. The 200 rpm 'Low' speed leads to screws stripping, or jumping off the tip. A shame, as this model has 2 speeds.2- No 'Straight-Slot' Tip ! Of all the drives I've had, most had TWO-ENDED bits for cross point AND straight slot. Not only is this model missing that, even if I bought a second tip, there is no clip to hold it, nor do I find any offered in the accessories section of the manual. Like discovering your turn signals only work in one direction!btw- Get it from a dealer with a GOOD return policy, as I found no Hitachi customer support for this unit. As it was, mine came with one bad battery, and given the above, I opted for a refund. No problem with Amazon."
4,Only problem is folding when not wanted,"Great little screwdriver, locking chuck works well, power is good. I would have liked the led to be white instead of amber, and also have a problem where the unit pivot mechanism works when I don't want it to. I would have liked a lock to prevent this from happening unless needed. I also happened to turn the led on when not needed- the switch for the led is in an overlooked place."
2,A little disappointed.,I was surprised to find that the drill comes with a case and extra battery but only one bit. Why would you sell a power tool with only one bit. And its a Phillips head bit. That's like buying a car but they give you no gas in the tank. I just expected it to have a few bits. I had to spend another $35 for bits from hitachi. Some of those bits do not even fit his drill/driver. I will be very skeptical when buying online and hitachi products.
5,great little screw driver,Hitachi DB3DL 3.6-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless ScrewdriveThis is one great little screw driver. I have purchased my third one. It is the most used power tool in my tool bucket. it is light weight and yet very powerful for it's size.
5,Excellent value!,"Great tool, useful features and a great price. Use it straight or fold for a pistol-like grip. It is plenty powerful for everyday loosening and tightening and the little LED light comes in handy. I especially like the fact that the chuck locks once you take your finger off the Fwd/Rev switch so you can tighten or loosen by hand. The battery lasts a long time and charges very quickly. My large 18 volt unit is gathering a lot of dust now. Buy an accessory bit kit with nut drivers and various driver tips for even more uses."
3,"Some good advice, but disappointing","The content of this book doesn't match it's title. This book is not an instructive guide to planning your estate; rather, it is a catalog of depressing stories combined with simplistic conclusions (""hire an attorney!""). The only useful conclusions I drew from the book are: hire a good estate planning lawyer, make use of the annual gift tax exclusion, and make sure you know something about trusts. Those are very important lessons, and hence the reason for giving the book 3 stars, but ultimately not worth the hundreds of pages it took to illustrate them.This is definitely a book to check out of the library rather than to purchase for yourself."
4,Required Reading if you're doing an estate plan,"This book gets you thinking about all the pitfalls in deciding who you should leave your money to, and with what stipulations. How do you avoid the mistakes other people have made?I have read about 9 estate planning books and talked to one attorney. This book gave me crucial advice that I did not find anywhere else. The stories and advice changed my mind about what I will do, because I have learned from the dozens of situations Mr. Condon experienced over the years.The book is not a masterpiece. And you may need one or two other books to round out your knowledge. However, it is clearly written, well organized, and rather entertaining.I give it 4-1/2 stars, and suggest it as required reading for anyone creating a will.~~> Check your library or the used copies page on amazon."
2,Beyond the Grave: The Right Way and the Wrong Way of Leaving Money to Your Children (And Others),"This was not a legal guideline as I hoped, but a book about how attorneys have more experience about what can go wrong."
4,Everyone Can Learn Something from this Book,"I thought this book pointed out many types of situations and gave good ideas and strategies for avoiding problems both while you are living and after you die and leave your assets to your beneficiaries. I did, however, feel that a lot of the examples were geared for those with significant estates. Most of the examples discuss people with estates well over $1,000,000. With that being said, even though my estate doesn't come close to this amount, the author gave me a lot to think about and I felt he had excellent advice -- even if all of it didn't apply to my particular situation.In my opinion, no matter how big or small your estate is, this book is worth the read if you are planning your estate. I feel that everyone has something to learn from the various situations the authors discuss in their book. Thank you Gerald and Jeffery Condon for being the eyes and ears from beyond the grave and helping us all learn from yours and your many clients mistakes."
4,Lots of mini-cases; Easy to read,"Only estate book I've seen written in an easy-to-read, mini-case-study format. Very practical and thought-provoking advice. Tends to focus on little worst-case scenarios in an attempt to get people to plan properly for all the things that can go wrong in an estate.For what it's worth, I thought the book was generally best-suited for estates with $100,000 to about $2,000,000 in assets. Don't get me wrong, there's something in here for all estate sizes - especially for people just starting the process of developing a plan. However, don't buy this book looking for technical discussions of advanced tax-minimizing strategies. If you or your clients have estates over this $2MM mark, this book can be a great thought-provoker, but some of the advice isn't really suitable for larger estates."
2,Wodehouse is uncharacteristically dull,"This is the forerunner to all those glorious Psmith books. Psmith isn't in this book; it's about the early school experiences of his pal Mike in the days before they met. While it's funny in places, it's by no means up to Wodehouse's usual standard. Possibly for it's target audience (young English boys) it works well, I'm in no position to say. Given the very large number of books by Wodehouse that are superb, there seems not much reason to bother with this one."
5,birds of a feather,"Finally, an author that I don't want to put down. I'm also giving Maisie Dobbs books for birthday gifts this year."
2,So-so,"Unofortunately, enthusastic reviews led me to expect more than Masie Dobbs could deliver. I bought the book in anticipation of ingenious plotting and interesting characters, overhashadowed by the Great War and all that implies. Unfortunately what I got was a strained plot, a relentlessly plucky heroine and a collection of characters right out of central casting. Devices used to create suspense were lamentably lame - one irritating example: for several chapters the author elects not to reveal an object found at the scene of the murders, but anyone who paid even the slightest attention to the title of the book is unlikely to be fooled.The one saving grace was the portrait of the time, inter-war England, complete with economic hardship, class distinctions and manners of the period. But it's hard not to think of Dorothy Sayers who did it so much better, with infinitely more subtleties of plot and character.""Birds of a Feather"", a pleasant, light read. Don't expect anything more."
4,This one is a winner,"I love Maise Dobbs. The author expresses the transitional period of British history wherein the women of the times test the waters of independence. One gets a notion of the clothing, the mores, the culture of the times that enrobes a Maise Dobbs mystery and this is no exception. This time, Maise starts with a rather simple case; find a missing person and, over time, discovers that this is much more than a missing person it is more about murder. As most readers do, I tried to figure out who the killer was but was held in abeyance until the very end. I would suggest that the reader, read each of the Maise Dobbs books in order if only because we see Maise mature as a woman and gather her history as we go. I read book six early as it was the only one I could get and it was very interesting but I can see the advantage of reading the Dobbs books in order."
4,One of my new favorite literary characters.,"Entertaining, good character development and suspenseful. I am thankful for a friend who introduced me to Maisie Dobbs. Great read with cup of tea and a warm fire."
4,Who knew about birds,What a surprise in connecting the title with the mystery solution. The cast of characters is very interesting. I look forward to more of Miss Dobbs.
5,Dobbs Series,I loved this series and am sorry I have read them all now. I would recommend them. Six more words...
3,Very formulaic,"Read one of the Maisie Dobbs and was interested, so I read another. I found the basic story line to be too formulaic to be interesting for long. The plot was okay, but I felt if I'd read one I didn't need to read another."
4,Good mystery,This is an interesting historical mystery. Maisie Dobbs is a delightfully complex charaacter. I really enjoyed this addition to the series.
2,Slow and boring,"I don't know if it just me or not, but I finally put it down to go to something else more stimulating. Just not my cup of tea!"
5,"Great author, Great book!",Received this book in great shape and quickly. I appreciate all my books and also appreciate those that get them out in such a timely manner.
5,Lovely!,"These adorable dog salt & pepper shakers are a great conversation piece. Well priced, nicely packaged. They make a great gift."
4,Nostalgia!,There were so many songs on here that made me remember my childhood. Hours spent watching my parents and their friends dance to these songs. My mami was amazed to hear so many oldies from her childhood. Beautiful cd.
4,The drill is fine,This is quite a drill and is better than any that I've had before. Very powerful and the charger is excellent and not some cheap add-on item. The only complaint is it arrived with the carrying case missing a hinge pin which was easy to ad-hoc fix.
2,Hitachi's break,"Bought one great power and time, HOWEVER, case broke the first time it was used and now the chuck is stripped out plus it is pricey compared to other drills for around the home."
1,"Good drill, bad informations","Hitachis cordless driver drill is a good, strong machine. Nothing to complain about there. However as a citizen from an European country it would be of good service from Amazon if the terms of importing articles to EU where included in price and conditions. I had big extra costs for customs. Furthermore is it of importance that you clearly inform wich voltage electrical devices are. It cost me another 40$ to buy a transformer from 110 volt to 230 volt. Suddenly my new drill is very expensive!"
4,And a Marshmallow on Top,"Hot Chocolate. Smooth, inviting, warm and rich. Most of the group originated from islands in the Caribbean but were based in England. Along with their big hits ""Emma"" (Emmaline) and ""You Sexy Thing"" was the group's version of ""Brother Louie"" (also covered by the group ""Stories""). This album is worth a listen alone for those three tunes. Everything else is a bonus. Maybe I should have said a cherry on top. Whatever. Enjoy."
3,Good for a good time,Heaven in the back seat of my cadillac gives barry white a run for his money! These wonderfully talented soulsters give us a little taste from the other side of the pond. Take it out & get your groove on!
3,Intro report,good intro report to current spatial hydrological techs. I found the references very useful
5,Very insightful book,"I read this book at the beginning of my six month stay in Germany while working. As I became more familiar with the Germans and their culture, I realized that this book absolutely right about so many things!Any foreigner going to live in Germany should read this book!"
2,shut up ardagh,"I have been reading this book all semester long, and I find that the author is the most predjudice author I've ever read from. Sometimes he says the wrong thing at the wrong time, and for that I do not like the book. I don't think it is one that someone who has an inch of German pride in them....they may get offended and go get this guy. I can't believe some of the things he says in the book. However, I do think it is a book for those who just are interested in Germany. Those using it for academic purposes or moving to Germany, etc, may get in trouble if they believe all the things he says in his book. Plus, I think Ardagh needs to get some facts straight."
4,A Fun Jaco Tidbit for the Dedicated Fan,"I agree with previous reviewer that this is one ""for those in love with Jaco's music"". It certainly is not first-rate Jaco. Nevertheless, second-rate Jaco still stands as unique and worthwhile. After collecting all his earlier studio stuff I bought this and was disappointed. More recently I have revisited it ""out of context"" so to speak, and it has the usual effect: can't help grooving. Just about any Jaco is a good thing. Sadly there is only a finite supply available. So if you are a disciple of the man, pick it up and enjoy. If you are more demanding, skip it. Me? I'm glad I have it."
5,Very original. old hymns with a Mckameys' flavor,Rememberance is the type of project you might expect from The Mckameys.
5,"MAX notes' ""Thomas Mann's 'Death in Venice'"" superb!","This book is a incredibly good help when you want help to understand Thomas Mann's ""Death in Venice"". It gives you summeries of the book, analysis, a presentation of the caracters and it suggests essay topics. The book helps you to prepare for classdiscussions because of it's answers and questions. Ask yourself the questions in the book and find out if you got the understanding of the text correctly. Then you can read the answers. You can't skip reading Mann's novella and ""take the easy way out."" The novella contains so much details and you do have to read it just to get the wonderful feeling and context. But when you have done that, MAX notes' book gives you so much more to add to the understanding of the story. This book gives me great help and inspiration for the college essay I'm about to write. This is the best investment in literature I've done for years!"
2,Maybe for the Socially Handicapped,"The book lays the basics about meeting people. There is no magic to this book. It simply states to go out and meet people, but does not tell you HOW!"
1,Generic fluff - don't buy this one,"It's revealing why there's no group listed as the artist for these tracks and why the tracks have no names -- my belief is that it was recorded by amateurs who had practiced very little and they used few musicians. That's why it's anonymous. Instead of this CD, buy anything recorded by Mocidade Independente, a true professional, world class samba school, arguably the best bateria in Rio, such as Mocidade's CD, ""Batucada Brasiliera,"" the 2 CD version, found elsewhere here at Amazon."
3,good for practice,"It is true, this is not batucada like Mocidade. I wouldn't say I love this CD. The nice thing is it is more improvisational and has fewer instruments. It is more like what you would play in a small group improvisational setting. I disagree that the musicians are amateurs, they are quite good. The mocidade folks rock, but they are usually playing arranged pieces. You can't have 10 tamborims all improvising differently and have it sound good. Improvising figures based on rhythmic ideas is not a trival task and you won't learn it listening to mocidade. This cd was given to me by the director of the samba group I play in and for that it has been a great source of ideas. I recommend it highly for that. There are not so many easily available recordings of batucada style samba in the US so sometimes you use what you can get."
1,Cat restraint - unrestraint,Cat still manages to pull off head with relative ease and pretty sure there isn't going to be a better product out there without restraining the legs of the cat.
1,Too hip for the room?,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. We are no longer friends. (Kidding .... but this book was really pretty lame.) It's written in a way that is too self-consciously cool, and unlike an homage to the beat authors it was just derivative. I strongly urge you to check this book out at the library or read excerpts before shelling out the bucks. I sure wish I'd done that."
2,Tries Too Hard to be Cool,"I guess I just don't get it. While attempting to read this I never was sure if at any particular moment the author was using metaphors or being literal in his storytelling. I am a voracious reader of sci-fi, horror, and fantasy, and I really wanted to enjoy this book and tried hard to finish it but couldn't get much further than half way. I got the impression that Mamatas was trying to be cool just for the sake of being cool - way too full of himself. Reminded me a lot of Tarantino's style of film making, which I often enjoy, but does sometimes get to be annoying. In this case, Mamatas style was pretty much continuously annoying to me"
4,The Steps to Nowhere,"Sadly this is a final album of the Motors. The Magic are gone but its a great album, not excellent"
5,works as excpected,The pot was a gift to my step-mother. She had recently broken both elbows in a bad fall. The pot was used to brew a chinese herbal medicine that speeds the healing of bones. It worked great the casts came off two months early and she got the OK for vigorous exercise two weeks after that. You need these kinds of pots to brew the formulas properly. Be forwarned though most traditional chinese medicine tastes just awful. So hold your nose and gulp it down as fast as possible.
2,Very little value,Very high level 'executive' overview of brokerage systems that use FIX. This book is of no value to anyone who needs to actually deal with any issues related to implementation of FIX. You could get much better information from (the very badly organized) Fix website: www.fixprotocol.orgWhy is it that when you put a lot of presumed smart diligent people in an industry group it inevitably degenerates into an internal terminology obfuscation contest producing un-user friendly documentation and lousy websites?If anyone knows of a good book on programming a FIX engine please let me know.
1,If you know even a little bit about FIX don't buy this book,"When this book first came out I thought it would provide a good introduction to FIX and how to implement it; so I bought a copy. I was thoroughly disappointed. While waiting for the book to arrive I had spent a few days browsing through the FIXprotocol.org website and I had already learned more about FIX than what this book had to offer.As other reviewers have said, if you are a high level manager who doesn't know FIX and wants to know what the fuss is all about, you might be able to gain something from this book. However if you are a developer/implementor or a FIX certification specialist, this book will provide very little value to you."
2,Totally lame book,"I suppose if you're a middle manager who's trying to figure out what FIX is all about, then this book might be a valuable addition to your bookshelf. If, however, you're a technologist and it's your responsibility to implement a FIX engine and/or integrate with one, then this book is a complete waste of time. Save some trees and go directly to the FIX web site for much more in-depth information. Despite the name which sounds quite authoritative, this is pulp, at best."
2,Do you want your kid to have a speech impediment?,"This product is wonderful in almost every regard: cute, harmless, has animals. Sadly, the good is overshadowed by the duck character's ""cute"" speech impediment! My four year old, who once spoke beautifully, hasn't pronounced his r's since he watched this over a month ago! I love the show, my kid loves the show, but as a parent, I already have enough problems! We won't be watching this again."
5,Great CD,I bought this in conjunction with the Wonder Pets DVD and I'm glad I did. My son listens to this over and over in the car and can't seem to get enough of it. I too know all the words! ha ha I highly recommend this if your child loves the Wonder Pets.
4,great selection!,"I bought this CD because my one year old is obsessed with the show, she really only pays attention to the songs. The CD includes a great selections of songs from the show. I noticed that the voice of ""Ming Ming"" (the duckling) seems to get drowned out by the music. Overall good CD, I definately recommend this if you would rather your child not be glued to the TV."
2,Read description,Well the service and the delivery time was excellent but the product description is off. I know Klein makes canvas bags for tools so when I read plastic case comes with this product I was thinking maybe a plastic version of this kind of bag and that's what sold me on buying the set. Needless to say I love Klein tools and everything I own by them but I'm really at a loss because I didn't get any kind of reusable plastic container with my set.
1,Heavy Weather Sailing in a Calm Bay,"A remarkable waste of money. John R., who wrote Fastnet, who is almost unbarable to watch as a spends the 1st half of the video reviewing obvious gear that one needs while sailing ( a knife, a light, a saftey harness, oh my god). He does this review on a boat in a slip in a harbour. Then he and a couple of buddies go out in Very Calm seas, close to the coast and continue to speak of the most basic technics for heavy weather sailing as we watch the background of the sunny coast a few miles away."
5,Makin A Difference-Karen Peck and New River,"A wonderful cd by a wonderful group...Karen Peck is the ""Real Deal""...I can say this because I know her personally....anything she sings is very anointed and heartfelt....Mike Stankovic Bloomington, Indiana"
1,"Disappointing rendition of the ""Bell Song""","Tryon's voice sounds very forced even at the best of times, but is nevertheless occasionally pleasant to listen to when she sings some popular music pieces. But where she really falls down is on her renditions of classical pieces. Thinking that she might have finally learned some bel canto coloratura technique, I bought her ""Bell Song"" track. Oy, what a disappointment!Tryon's ""Bell Song"" rendition of this album is painful to listen to. For starters, its tempo is slowed way WAY down to compensate for Tryon's lack of coloratura ability. But even so, nothing can compensate for bad technique, and Tryon clearly has no knowledge of how to do coloratura singing. Her runs sound like they are squeaked out so forcefully that they must have caused her pain when she sang them.She hits the notes, even if not very securely at times. So she's not quite at the Florence Foster Jenkins level of awful, but Tryon's ""Bell Song"" just one level up from FFJ's."
3,Parents should pre-read,"This incredibly beautiful -- breathtakingly beautiful -- storybook features illustrations by Leo and Diane Dillon, one of my favorite teams. Their art is palpable.This book is an oral folktale of slaves reaching the end of their endurance and rising up, flying away. It is beautifully done.There are whippings in this book, and parents know best what the right age is for their children to hear about a baby being whipped."
2,Not His Best Writing,"I've read several of Robin Cook's novels, and this wasn't up to par. The writing was very jerky, as if he had someone else flesh out the story line. It was not completely his style of writing. It did have his usual medical jargon, explained for the lay person, and his usual twists and turns in his plots and sub-plots. Some of it was slightly unbelievable, especially the cemetery scene and the epilogue.Now for the kicker: Didn't anyone realize that on p. 4 of the paperback, RC names two obstetric doctors in that hospital, one named Braxton, the other Hicks, saying that Jeffrey was glad they weren't on call that night? (Think about false labor pains--they are called Braxton Hicks pains, named after a doctor in the 1800s.) It's like Robin Cook (or whoever was filling in the storyline) decided it would be great fun to see what reader, if any, would catch that bit of word play."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a fan of RC and this is the first disappointment I've experienced. For me, a good book has a have a likeable protagonist and Jeffry was not only unlikeable, he was disgustingly indecisive, moronic in his decision making and rather than acting like an educated 40 year-old dr, he ran around like a 16 year-old with no clue as to what is going on. I'm half way thru the book and just can't take the frustration with this idiot any more and will go on to a different RC. I am still a fan."
4,Amazingly Breath-Taking,"I must admit, Harmful Intent was much better than I anticipated. With a somewhat slow beginning, it picked up the pace sooo fast! In my opinion, Robin's protagonist, Dr. Jeffrey Rhodes was unforgetable! Very smart and I loved the way he outwitted his pursuers. Nail-biting suspense from the middle to the end, and the medical terms were understandable to a great degree. But I would like to comment to a reviewer on this book, the novel DID NOT TAKE PLACE IN BROOKLYN NY. It was Boston, MA. Thank you."
2,The story was fair,"but this abridgement is the poorest that I have ever heard or read. There were many elements left out of the story, including some that were mentioned on the cover! With all the missing elements of the story, I'm sure there were nuances that were totally missed, leaving just a fair story with no build up or satisfying resolution. What remained was a ""B"" grade short story, making me very cautious to ever buy another abridgement. If you like Robin Cook, and want to hear this audio book, I strongly suggest you listen to the unabridged version. It most definitely has to be much better!!"
4,great medical thriller,"This was the first Robin Cook book that I read and it got me hooked. I've read many of his books. Unfortunately, many of his books have similar plot themes. Nevertheless, this book was fantastic. He has a suspenseful way of writing and medically, is accurate. You will enjoy this book, especially if you have a medical background (although I don't think it is necessary)."
3,A good story with a terrible ending.,"Robin Cook knows how to write and he really makes you care about the characters in his stories. Knowing that Robin Cook is a medical doctor, I was fully prepared for a uniquely medical drama. I was pleasantly surprised that the story mixed in much more than that. However, ""Harmful Intent"" had an ending that leaves you wondering if Mr. Cook didn't run out of time and ideas as he approached the conclusion of the story. The plausability is maintained throughout the story until this point. It was what I would call an ""eye-roller"" after reading the epilogue"
3,The ending screwed up the whole book,Most of the book is compelling but the ending or even the whole plot is too simple.
4,"John Rubenstein does an adequate job. Not bad, but not great","John Rubenstein doesn't really capture the heart of the story in his voice, but he makes up for it in portaying the suspense scene well, so that you can feel what it looks like in your mind. There were no sound effects or music through the whole thing (except for the noises of doctors hustling and bustling at the beginning of the tape), and I was disappointed with that; but this book on tape was altogether a good one. I look forward to reading more Robin Cook books (I don't want to listen to one again!)."
2,It's funny...but not a side-splitter,"It does have funny moments...but Joan has used these jokes over and over and over on other programs. In this video, she and a co-star spend most of the movie looking for Heidi who never really appears. That got old fast, the frantic search scenes."
2,MMMMmmm,"Lover her actually, Though quite disappointed,she was better when i saw her live in Australia."
5,BEACH GIRLS,Lots of sexy women in this movie. The music is great too. I found the plot to be clever and most of all funny! There is a Playboy Playmate in this movie. I had this movie on Beta and finally got it on DVD. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I must have seen it at least 10 times and never get tired of it. There are lots of topless scenes too.
2,Excess Gratuitous Violence,"I never thought I'd run across a suspense thriller that contained too much gratuitous violence. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude. I like a good shoot-em-up as well as the next guy. It's OK to have the villan kill one or two victims if that adds to the plot. That isn't the case here. Our villian kills and kills and kills and kills and it has nothing to do with the larger scheme of things. Just random killings.This killing spree wouldn't be so bad if he hadn't described each one in excruciatingly disgusting detail. I've read horror books with less gore.Even without the gore I'd only rate this book about a 3 because it is so predictable. Good girl had troubles. Good guy helps good girl. Good guy gets Bad guy. Good guy falls in love with good girl. They live happily ever after. So predictable that nothing is very exciting."
5,Another great read!,Ridley Pearson is one of my favorite authors and he continues to put out wonderful stories. Cannot wait for the next book!
4,High Stakes Auction,"Ridley Pearson introduces new characters in CUT AND RUN a high stakes thriller without the recent plodding of Lou Bolt. A few characters from the previous series help Roland Lawson in his frantic search for a master list from the Witness Protection Program that has Hope Stevens name listed for execution. The list is rumored to be auctioned to the highest bidder, but a vicious killer is striking from behind the scenes.Fast packed action in a new direction.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,an excellent read,"This was an excellent read by Ridley Pearson. The man can write and we read and enjoy. This book moves and takes you with it.Enjoy.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,Much better than his last,"Once the action starts, the reader is along for the ride. Our hero's love life, however, is like watching a teen pine for his perfect love, very hard to take. But overall a very good adventure."
4,"good read, but geographically mis-informed","This was a fun book to read, the plotting was good and characters interesting. My only quibble is that the author needs to research his geography before placing his characters. Here, he has the denouement scenes taking place in the City of Mountlake Terrace, Washington. He is correct that this city is north of Seattle - however, it has absolutely no connection to Seattle, is actually located in a different county from Seattle and has it's own police force. There is no way that a Seattle PD Swat team would be operating in the City of Mountlake Terrace. I know because I live just a few blocks from this city.Other than that, it was a fun thriller. This is the first book of his that I have read, so I will try other titles."
5,Fast-paced Thriller,"Six years ago, US Marshall Roland Pearson fell in love with protected witness, Hope Stevens. Hope was to testify in the trial of the Romero crime family. When things became dangerous, Hope disappeared (hence the title CUT AND RUN) into a new life escaping both mob and the government. Now the master list of the protected witnesses is stolen and it is up for grabs to the highest bidder. Hope is again a target and when Hope's five-year old daughter is kidnapped, Roland vows to get her back alive and protect Hope at the same time.Pearson has written a first-rate thriller with engaging characters and a suspenseful plot. I had trouble putting this book down. It was very fast moving which made it fast reading because I always wanted to find out what happened next. I always enjoy Pearson's Lou Boldt series and hope he is featured in the next novel, but this was an excellent departure from the series."
3,Just okay!,"Nothing very special with this book. Publishers Weekly called it one of his best, and I just don't see it. It's a plot that's been done, and characters that were pretty bland for the most part."
2,Less than I expected,"This was my second Ridley Pearson book. Based on the first one, I expected this one to be not only a good story but also to have a little depth. But while it was full of action and easy to read, it seemed to have no real substance. It was the mystery equivalent of a Harlequin romance. I will try Pearson again because the first Lou Boldt book I read was pretty strong. But had I read this book first I would likely not have read more."
2,badly written with lousy plot and scenario. HORRIBLE!,"maybe ridley pearson is going downhill or maybe he tried to churn out more than he could logically put together. and this problem has become worse during these years. now he just read totally similar to another james patterson, generic, stereotyped, formatted with 1 or 2 dimensional characters, totally impossible and vague plot, on and on, exactly what this specific book has shown. i never abandon him since his first book, but now, i think it's time to put him away as one of the failing writers beyond salvage. reading this book only forced me to put another coffin nail to this conclusion. i rest my case."
1,Completely Implausible Tripe,"I just finished this audio book. I have not read any of the authors previous efforts, but it doesn't have to be a great read to beat this plot. So stupid. You take the only witness to multiple RICO crimes and put her right in the compound of the bad guys. As usual, the assassin bad guy is like Superman. Super fast, strong and can take multiple injuries and pain and keep going. This Marshall Larson must be a real puss. The heroine is so obnoxious, I was ready for the bad guys to kill her. I do not know of any Law enforcement agency where this is even in the realm of day dream. Pretty stupid and pedestrian."
4,Action-packed thriller,"Roland Larson, U.S. Marshal, six years ago, did what he was not supposed to do, fall in love with a protected witness, Hope Stevens. You get a very brief glimpse at their romance before the action takes off. Fast forward six years, and Larson is still looking for Hope; for instance sitting in on Shakespeare events just hoping to find her. Hope Stevens is now Alice Stevenson who has a very precocious five-year old daughter named Penny. They're constantly on the run, and Penny has had enough. She walks right into the trap set by the Romero brothers, the family who wants to kill her mother. At the same time, the Federal Witness Protection list is in jeopardy when the computer genius behind the list is kidnapped. Once Larson, a gruff, no-nonsense U.S. Marshal finds Hope, he behaves like an awkward adolescent in love. Their love story is not well developed but the quick-moving action more than makes up for this shortcoming."
5,a beautiful book anyone will cherish.,"The haiku structure doesn't inhibit Lily Wang from creating beautiful images filled with love, wonder, emotions, and transcendental spirituality. This is a beautiful book of memories that anyone will cherish."
4,Baby haiku,"I don't generally like haiku, but I found these poems to be easily accessible by the normal reader with its use of everyday language. Her poems beautifully express what it means to be a first-time mother as well as addressing fatherhood and becoming a sibling. The unique cover as well as the moving poems makes it a great gift!"
1,This book IS junk!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I had expected this to be an instruction manual on organizing and ""de-junking"" my life. I don't know what it was intended to do, but it did nothing for me. Two major complaints I had were:1) Very difficult to read. He rambles on and on but never says very much. I also detected a twinge of bitterness in most of the writing.2) Does not teach you HOW to ""de-junk"" and organize anything. I was looking for concrete ideas on what to get rid of, how to distinguish the junk for the potential good, and how to store what I kept for quick and easy retrieval. I didn't find anything of that nature in the book."
2,Dumpster Approach,"I would recommend this book to read from a clutter standpoint but not as a book on dealing with Chronic Disorganization. I found this book,"" Clutters Last Stand"", is not as easy to read as it may appear at first glance. I feel the author has the information presented in choppy portions throughout the book it did not always flow together. Reading this book was similar to reading a newspaper. The authors attitude is to get rid of everything and that is not the approach to have with many clients that have difficult organizing situations. This book is worth reading but not to get information on working with clients with Chronic Disorganization. The author has a get a dumpster approach to everthing and that is not always the best approach and will not work with everyone."
3,Clutter's Last Stand:,Feel it is very much about Don and not as helpful as could be expected from the title
5,Clutter's Last Stand,"This book is one of many written by Don Aslett. He is the 'king' of tidy and clean homes, just as Julia Childs is the 'queen' of our kitchens. His enthusiasm and humor make for a great read while his experience shines through. His suggestions actually work! I have been a disciple of Don Aslett for over 40 yrs."
5,It's About DeJunking--NOT About Organizing!,"I've read this book & a few others that Aslett has written. This is my favorite by far. It is motivational & always makes me want to jump up & dejunk my house. I have a short list of books that are so good that I try to re-read them every year--this book is on that list! If you ever find that you can't easily put things away because your cupboards, drawers or closets are too crowded, or you ever feel like you ""should"" keep something (gift, belonged to someone dear to you, could be worth something, someone might be able to use it, etc.) then this is the book for you! Don Aslett has a good sense of humor & writes in an easy-to-read manner. It doesn't take a long time or a lot of concentration to read his books, plus you actually want to get up & simplify your life before you've even finished the book! Highly recommend this book for pretty much anyone to read! :-)"
5,will change your life,"Learn to distinguish between junk and good stuff. Learn to turn junk INTO good stuff (A drawer full of photographs is junk. An album, out where people can turn the pages, is a precious keepsake.) Learn how to get rid of stuff that you THINK you value that is actually junk, and NEVER miss it. A handbook for anyone living in the modern world."
1,"Too stupid to think, ""hey throw out six year old daily newspapers?""","Aslett thinks you are.I found the ideas minimally helpful in my first foray into decluttering (organizing is a different place) but Aslett is so condenscending in his writing and in the vapid illustrations, that I tossed the book aside in disgust.It's in a Goodwill in Aurora now.I don't need a lecture on drinking soda. It has NOTHING to do with getting crap out of your closets.Might be worth one library check out, or for a high school student.Better books by better writers are out there."
2,Disappointing! Hard to read! In a word...JUNK!,"I found that I was very disappointed in this book. While reading an organization book, the author recommended several other books including this one. I thought since the book I was reading was a good one that Clutter's Last Stand would also be good. Boy, was I wrong! It was boring and could be summed up in one paragraph instead of dragging this book out for pages and pages."
1,cluttered pages,Too much print without much being said. I found this book confusing & down right boring. to help your clutter problem loose this book in the nearest garbage can.
2,I've Read Better,"I was disappointed when reading Clutter's Last Stand. I had heard great reviews on this book, but I have read better. I've read alot of books on this subject and simplifying and this one was OK, but not great."
4,Commercial game design at it's best,"Ernest Adams brings to us a bible in commercial game design. Commercial is the keyword, as you'll be taught how to make a commercial game that will appeal to publishers and the masses alike. Some of the material may be a bit obvious to gamers and already working game designers, but don't over estimate the power of having someone actually spell it out to you, bringing many themes, ideas and rules from the depths of your subconscious to the forefront. This book also brings to light fine details that you wouldn't normally think about when designing a game, but are extremely critical in the overall design work.If you are ready to design commercially appealing games, then this is your book. If you are more of an independent developer, looking to break the mold that most publishers wouldn't dare to fund, then perhaps you should look elsewhere."
5,Wow,This seller shipped the item very promptly. It was nice to have the book in time for my class. Thank you!
5,Very clear and easy to understand,The book takes the subject of implementing a management system to comply with ISO 9000 and makes it easy to understand in common sense business terms. There seems to be a real effort to make ISO 9000 relevant to business improvement. I found the book quite useful and full of helpful hints.
3,"Decent fashion advice, annoying presentation","My old boss recommended this book to me when I said that I knew nothing about men's fashion. The book has some decent advice, but I can't stand Kressley's writing style. How many times did he need to introduce a sentence with the word ""people""? Also, his snotty decision not to include ironing tips for men's shirts because you should dry clean all your clothes anyway is retarded. Good tips if you don't feel like doing a lot of reading, but be prepared to be annoyed."
4,Good stuff that's fun and entertaining,"I really liked this book a lot. I have several of the books like this, including Alan Flusser. This was definitely no Flusser, but Carson keeps it real in a way that keeps you engaged. As a style consultant myself, I don't agree with everything he says, but a lot of it is on point. For example, he talks about how personal style is, while also dictating some aspects, like pleats vs. no pleats. Any signature look that you create for yourself can involve any pieces, patterns, colors, etc., as long as you are consistently being true to a particular aesthetic. Pleated pants work very well for some people, especailly black men who generally have bigger buns. Overall, this is a really good book."
5,Mens Fashion and Style,This book provides lots of insight and information for men to dress better and look successful both personally and professionally. I wish it provided more suggestions on where to shop and brands to purchase based on quality. It is worth reading.
4,For the not so fashionable guy,I bought this book for some fashion tips and it doesn't disappoint. He shares a lot of good fashion tips and tells what you must have in your closet. I never knew there were different kinds of shoes before. I gave it a four star because it doesn't have enough pictures. It has a lot of illustrations but it doesn't have pictures of how all these clothes & shoes fit together. It would have been a very good addition to have real pictures worn by normal men of the different styles so that we can actually look at it instead of imagining how it would look like.
4,Simple to read for the average guy,"For a little over $12, this book gives a lot of info about the different types of clothes/accessories that the average guy would not have been aware of. It simple enough for anyone to read and gives a lot of useful tips without getting into too much detail about useless stuff.For example, the discussion on different types of pants and when it is appropriate to wear them is really very practical. A highly-recommended book for anyone who wants to improve their wardrobe."
4,Informative and Funny,Karson's Approach is very informative and funny although I might not agree with all of his ideas on styling. I like the fact that he can be very 'in-your-face' but that's great and at least he's being honest with a lot of fashion faux pas that people make.
1,A special mix of vain and creepy,I have this sitting on my coffee table for humor value. The photo shoot pages are a special mix of vain and creepy. Not sure how this ever made it to print.
2,a big disappointment,"Customer reviews of Ted Allen's ""Everything a Man Need's to Know About Style"" criticize the lack of detail and shortness of the book. I would say Kressley's longer and more detailed book, ""Off the Cuff,"" suffers from the opposite problem in my opinion. Overflowing with filler and fluff, this book doesn't have enough useful or funny information to justify such a lengthy hardcover book. If you took out all the useful parts, what you'd have is Ted Allen's shorter - and cheaper - version. If you could buy them both used, I'd suggest buying ""Off the Cuff"" for what little it has that Allen's book doesn't have but otherwise save your money."
1,"Which one is this - Remus, or Romulus?","Does he BELIEVE he was hired for TV because of his GOOD TASTE? Or just to laugh at in humiliation of him and his ""fashion victims""? Obviously Carson is someone raised by wolves, but I do ""Lupa"" and the boys an injustice by failing to note their superiority.Just look at the dork! Wearing old lady slippers, and NO SOCKS!His advice is all on the cover, and looking at it to see what NOT to do is all that's necessary to receive full benefit of the book."
4,Buy it now,If you bought CFS3 you must have this add on. Makes a world of difference when you add it to CFS3.Shoot 'em up at its finest!
3,It's ok... Would not recommend.,"It's very hard to relax and do yoga when your baby is crawling all over the place. It could be useful when the baby is still very little and not able to crawl. I only used this DVD a couple of times and then just stopped using it. It was kind of useless to me, I'm used to relaxing and calm environment for yoga not chasing after the baby and being constantly on alert."
5,univeral themes,"What a beautiful story to show children that, despite our differences, i.e. age, race, family background, we still have some many important things in common. Characters have wit, charm and integrity. Story is very moving and good for all ages."
5,Pleasantly entertaining...,"Three Fingers was part of a huge comics purchase some years ago. I knew nothing about it except that it had won some acclaim. Out of a box of over a dozen comics, it was the best purchase.Three Fingers is a graphic novel mockumentary of the cartoon industry using interviews of caricatures of famous cartoon characters. Part of the appeal was 1) the mystery, 2) the dead-on replication of the characters' personalities, and 3) the deeply mined personalities of the interviewees and the drama of it all. I'm in my thirties and LOVED reading this book. If you know Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, and others, you will enjoy how the author plays them all against one another in a huge tapestry of story and emotion.My main complaint is that Three Fingers wasn't longer. That's it. I don't think the story could have truly sustained any more pages, but that's just how good it was."
2,Poor but acceptable,"I bought this radio as a travel radio alarm clock. I have used it for two weeks. It does a very poor job of getting FM or AM stations when you are not in a large city. I was using it in small cities. Second, the antenna is very hard to use. You need real force to get it out of the radio, and it seems to be breaking. This is after two weeks of daily use. The plus side is that the radio is light. But if I had to make the purchase again I would definitely buy a radio that weighed about 16 ounces, and might do a better job away from major cities and had higher quality control."
1,Another low quality radio,"I like shortwave portables, but currently it seems that no manufacturer makes one that is delivered without problems. The Kaito's AM band selectivity is not just annoying, but appears to be at least five (ten?) channels wide, making it worse than useless on that band. I've seen crystal radios with far better selectivity. The other bands/features work well, but as usual, there is one glaring problem."
3,"Has Its Moments, But Sequels Are Better","This crime story has some scary scenes, with an especially memorable one early on with a woman hiding in a clothes dryer. In fact, the first half of this is excellent but it peters out that point with two typical Hollywood clichés of crime movies of the period.They are: 1 - the good cop (Leo Rossi as ""Sam Dietz"") going it alone despite the orders of his superior; 2 - the killer going to the good cop's house to kill his family. Without those standard scenes, I would have rated this four stars, instead of three.By the way, what's with Meg Foster's eyes? It looks like they have no pupils. It's eerie to look at that woman's face.This movie spawned several sequels and the sequels were better and better as they went along with the third, I believe, being the best."
2,Not all that it's cracked up to be,"Relentless was Judd Nelson's best film. Though it's not great at all, the kills are stupid, and so is the story. If you want a really good serial killer movie, buy The watcher with Keanu Reeves. This film was stupid and not at all frightening or grotesque like they said it would be. It could have been much better. But I give Judd Nelson 5 stars for doing his best in this film. Though the story and plot stunk."
4,movie relentless,this movie was good like it crazy i do have the other 3 all was good keeps u thinking all the way through the show
4,No doubt gtr/bass tab,"I have found this book to be no less than what I expected of Hal Leonard books. It was very accurate and if you want to learn some No Doubt music, Pick it up! I highlyrecommend it."
5,Excellent music... but...,"I own the Sega CD versions of Ecco the Dolphin: Tides of Time and the first Ecco. On those game CDs are perfectly playable tracks of all the games music, five tracks of which can be sampled through Amazon.So if you're leary about purchasing this CD, you might want to consider getting both Sega CD games as they might be cheaper in total, and contain a much larger amount of tracks (29 in total, I believe..).The music itself is excellent... The best in the world for a video game.. very atmospheric, and very creative. I could live without the dolphin sounds during the music, but at the same time it doesn't kill me.I hope this helps."
3,"Lovely music, poor album presentation","While the Ecco games are not notable for their gameplay the graphics, atmosphere and haunting music have always enchanted, thrilled and chilled me. Spencer Nilsen's etheral music really takes you away during gameplay and puts you right in the primal, beautiful world of Ecco. This album from 1996 however doesn't do the music justice. Instead of giving us many tracks with a couple of loops before gradually fading out each track is a rather rude mash-up of many themes that don't even blend together. Instead they just suddenly jump to a new theme. It's jarring and distracting.If you want a better presentation just by the Ecco the Dolphin Mega CD and use that instead. The CD doubles as a soundtrack album and gives you loads more tracks with better arrangement. Leave this overpriced product be."
4,The best video game music I've heard.,This CD is a must for any Ecco the Dolphin fan. I love to listen to it while working on the computer. It is great for background music.
5,The best CD of ocean music ever composed,"I've even heard this CD being played over the speaker system at an aquarium before... it is just the most perfect, breathtaking ocean music ever... every track manages to have a different mood and they're all fantastic.I like ""The Machine"" and ""Treefish"" a lot.... ""Sounding Echo"" and ""Time Forgotten"" too. And all the rest."
1,Not a good cd it you like melody in mucic.,"I bought this cd without ever hearing it, I thought I would take a chance. I discovered the music is not the style I like. The tracks contain very little melody. The album contains much percussion,of various styles. The whale or dolphin sounds are limited, seemingly most noticable on the first track. One of the artists who contributed to the album has been noted to add ""general weirdness"" which I think is quite fitting. This album I consider to be on the lines of new age, mixed with avant-guard attributes. If you want some easy, relaxing, music, this is not the album for you. I prefer Nilsen's album ""Architects Of Change"" much more."
1,Difficult to Read,"I'm an undergraduate student and I read this book for a class on Ancient Law. I did not like this book at all and I do not recommend it. I suggest you try and find a different book on ancient Roman criminal law (hopefully there's another one out there). I found it very difficult to read because it lacked smooth transitions, sentences were often worded strangely, and the author assumes the reader is familiar with Latin or able to easily look up Latin words. Concepts were difficult to understand and I found myself re-reading passages a few times. If you're required to read it for a class, like I was, I wish you luck."
2,For Cognoscenti Only,"Having been a practicing criminal lawyer for over 30 years, and having been a student of Roman history for nearly 50 years, I had trouble digesting this book. The diction was turgid, the allusions were obscure, and the author assumed too much prior knowledge on the part of the reader.Regardless of its shortcomings, the book repaid careful study. I recently began reading ""The Trial and Death of Jesus"" by Haim Herman Cohn, an Israeli Supreme Court Justice. That book presents another hard reading experience, but the background of criminal law and procedure gained from this book has served me well in helping to place Justice Cohn's analysis in context."
5,666 IS A 10-10-10!,"ALARMA!! If you like slammin',efx-filled dance music buy this CD-single or anything by these guys. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. These are the guys that lay claim to the huge club cuts ""Bomba"" and ""Get Up 2 DA Track(666 is Back)"". With music like this, these guys are sure to be around for a long time. It will rock on any good club or car system. Just be careful, because the quick siren sounds really scream on tweeters and will make your ears ring. Also, everybody will want to know what this song is and who it is by. I am always more than happy to let people know because 666 rules!"
3,"Good, but a better collection is available","This is an good overview of the Allman Brothers, but for the same price the remastered and expanded The Road Goes On Forever cd is much better. It has several essential cuts such as the live Hot 'Lanta and Enlightened Rogues' Pegagus that are missing here. It also has the unedited, unbutchered version of the classic instrumental Jessica (why did this cd reduce it to a 4 minute single cut here- no excuse and that alone is reason not to buy this cd). So while this has many good tracks, the other cd is better and remastered for great sound (24 bit). Also recommended is Mycology that will fill in for the later years not covered by The Road Goes On Forever."
3,Great Collection BUT,"I hate when some anthology pares a classic recording. The 4 minute single version of 'Jessica' makes this another anthology with one major flaw that leaves a permanent bad taste in the mouth of listeners. At least 'Decade of Hits,"" which is but one disc and fails to capture that first and easily best Allmans decade adequately (it omits, to give just one example, 'Win, Lose, or Draw'), features the full 7 minute jam that is 'Jessica.' I no more want a hacked version of 'Jessica' than I want a hacked version of 'In Memory of Elizabeth Reed.'"
4,This is one Good Compilation,"I am a newcomer to the Allman Brothers Band music and this compilation is my first Allman CD. Overall, I really enjoyed this CD and it made me appreciate the band and their music. There's an interesting combination of blues, country, and classic rock in their music that makes the anthology fun to listen to. My favorites on disc one were ""Trouble No More,"" ""Revival,"" and ""Statesboro Blues"" sang live. I thought ""Ramblin' Man,"" ""Can't Lose What You Never Had,"" and ""End of the Line"" were the highlights of disc 2. I thought this is well worth the listening time and cost. It's a really good summation of the Allman Brothers Band music history."
3,Ok but too childish,"The book is undoubtedly good, the trama is good and writing is decent, unfortunately for me I am 45 and the book is destined for much younger readers, will give it to my 14 year old son."
5,The Ingredients of a Q. T. Pie,"This book brought a smile to my face as I began to read it. Oh, the memories of being a Q. T. Pie. All little girls no matter what race would be inspired from this book. What a great way to develop a little's girl self esteem at such an early age."
4,New listening,Heard one of his songs while sitting around the table with friends so decided to try and has really enjoyed this album.
4,carpet stapler review,I was very satisfied with the product. However a suggestion for future purchases would be to include a few staples so a person could hit the carpet running.
4,Second only to Year One... and that's not bad.,"This is a well told story with good artwork. It's not quite as good asBatman: Year One, but I don't think anything is (personally, I prefer Year One toBatman: The Dark Knight Returns). This is a good sequel, and an enjoyable sequel to Y1. Do you need to own it? It's probably worth it... I am glad I bought it."
2,A little dissapointed,"Not what I expected, the script is OK, I was hoping for a more pshycological history, you want Joker origins history? Read ""The Killing Joke"""
3,Batman meets the Joker,Good joker story. Not too deep but ok for what it is. Messy artwork but purposefully done to convey the anarchy brought on by The Clown Prince Of Crime.
2,Eh.,"Compared to Brubaker's output on Sleeper, Criminal, or even The Authority... I don't want to use the wrong adjective... mediocre. Agressively mediocre."
3,The book is half good... literally,"This book contains two different stories. First a follow up to The Killing Joke that is, for me at least, quiete fantastic. It have the action, element of suspense... you name it, this story have it.On the other hand, the second story, I wouldn't say is a bad story, but it definably doesn't belong to this book at all. This is called ""The Man who Laughs"", so I really don't see a point of putting a story with no Joker. The second arc is cleary there just to make a bulkier book. Even though, the book is a short one.I like the first half of the book, but the rest doesn't quite worth my money. Anyway I got it and it's done."
2,nothing special,"""The Man Who Laughs"" came with 2 stories and I liked the second one (meant to be an extra) much better. It's called ""Made of Wood"" and it features green lantern Alan Scott. It's a cool serial killer story and made picking this up from my local library not a complete waste. I didn't like ""The Man Who Laughs."" The art style was meh and the plot was whatever. I'm glad I didn't purchase this because overall it was disappointing."
3,Mixed bag,"I loved the Joker story but the second story doesn't have the joker and is somewhat weak when compared to the first one. If fact, the second story isn't even really about Batman. He is included and is a major character but it is a very weak story. Only get this if you have extra money."
4,"Great, but not worth so much.","The story is great in this comic book, however, it's too short. I finished it in one sitting. The rest of the book are a few Detective comics with the Green Lantern. My money was going for the original ""Man Who Laughs"" story, not the other one. Therefore I paid too much for this."
4,Nick Lite-Brite refill Set,"The product is great. My daughter loves it. The only downfall, is that it does not fit the screen exactly of our flat-screen lite-brite. The paper is too big, and so my daughter has a hard time lining it up with the holes on the screen. If I help her then it is fine, but she likes to do things independently now, and she has a hard time with this product. She still loves it though."
4,Interesting story and helpful tips,"If you are looking for a detailed 'how to' on networking, this may not be it. However if you are interested in learning about Ferrazzi and his career development...with the hopes of learning a few methods or tips from him, you will get them. Like most books on this topic, there are assumptions like an ivy league education, single manhattan lifestyle, and 80 hr/wk big 4 consulting gig that will make duplicating his experience nearly impossible. But the book offers a quick, interesting, and motivating read."
1,Shame is for Sissies,"As Edward von Kloberg III, a flamboyant lobbyist who did public relations for the most notorious dictators, would say, ""Shame is for sissies.""This book proposes shameless use of friends and connections to get power and influence.Some of the tips are plain silly while others are useful. If you eliminate the names of the rich and famous that are meant to impress us, the book could be reduced to pamphlet size.Save your money. Like others have noted, the favorable reviews are probably from Ferrazzi's connections in pay-back."
1,"Repetitive, Contentless Fluff Written by an Egomaniac","This book appears to have been written by a Deloitte/Accenture/Bearingpoint software called ""Consultantspeak Generator 7.1"", generously sprinkled with enough stories to stroke Ferrazzi's ego and make sure that each of his 5,000 friends gets a mention. I'm glad I borrowed it from the library rather that buying it. Each of Ferrazzi's 'secrets' is in actuality, complete common sense, that anyone with a smidge of social skills over the age of twelve already knows. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs."
2,Never sit next to Ferrazzi on a plane ride,"I found this book difficult to take seriously. It's advice is great if you are neurotically insecure and need everyone to like you, but I seriously doubt if you'll make many friends by pinging people you meet on planes. Ferrazzi comes across as an annoyingly insecure nuisance, name-dropping like it might impress people, spewing out blindingly obvious bullet points on how to be a human being.His approach to networking is exactly how gay men chat each other up at nightclubs. It works if you have no family, no responsibilities beyond work and can affort to flirt from one casual acquaintance to another without worrying about depth of relationship. It's the business equivalent of casual sex. Enjoy."
2,Is there anything worse...,"than the veiled call from a so-called friend to ""catch up"" only to discover that they need something. Seems like Keith does a lot of that. Does this guy have a true friend in the world or just a rolodex of people that he uses to move up the business ladder?No wonder they say it's lonely at the top. Sure networking is fine and so is success, but not nearly as important as true friends and family."
1,How many names can you put in a book?,"A close friend recommended this and after reading it I didn't know if it was a book on networking or Keith Ferrazzi's address book. I would almost like to go back and count how many names were mentioned. The book brings to question, who not how? It seems to me if you're always asking someone else to perform on your behalf, you infact have no skill to offer. Ferrazzi seems to feel very strong about building relationships, not business contacts, which is respectable, but then it appears that he uses those relationships as resources in order to generate more income for his private consulting company, Ferrazzi Greenlight. Some people might call that ""using your friends."""
5,REQUIRED READING FOR A SUCCESSFUL LIFETIME,"This should be required reading for all past, present and future people interested in having a great fulfilling life.No matter what your chosen field may be, it shows you life should be about caring and sharing in your family, your friendships and your work environment.If we all had these values set in our minds, every business, school, household, church, government,etc.; would be so much better. Helping each other to obtain whatever goals we have set would be possible.Modern day version of the old ""Do unto others"" commandment."
2,"Too much ego, too little practical information","There is some useful advice in here, but it is buried under a whole lot of self-aggrandizing. Also, Ferrazzi comes off as pushy and overly schmoozy, someone who only collects acquaintances in the hopes that he can use them some time in the future. Sort of a waste of time/money, at least for me."
1,Hardly revolutionary,"I'll keep this brief. This book is written solely from the personal experience of the author. As such, although the ideas are reasonable, they all seemed somehow shallow. The ideas themselves are hardly revolutionary, possibly best described as ""ideas from Dale Carnegie as applied to Keith's life"". As I force fed myself this book, my brain kept regurgitating the thought that this is nothing more than chest thumping from an egomaniac."
2,It was ok,"The subtitle for the book should be ""And Really Annoy People."" I like the idea of this book, but it really is more or less just hounding people until you get what you want. For some people that might work, but it just doesn't fit my personality."
4,Increadable book on a difficult subject,"What is networking. It is connecting, connecting with other people and developing relationships. this is what this book is allabout, how do we go about doing that, who do we try to get to know. Mr. Ferrazzi tells how a small town boy from Pennsylvania grew to become the master networker and how you can learn from his success.I liked this book alot and took a lot from it, to develop my own networking skills, I especially liked the part about not schmoozing but at a function try to have a great conversation with 2-3 people not superficial ones with many. I also enjoyed the section on how to get past a ""gatekeeper"" ie personal assistant to get to the person you are trying to get into contact with.Great book on how to develop and expand your network."
4,Great Book,"Read this book you'll know the reasons why people succeeded in the 20th, 19th, 18th century, and will keep on doing so in the 21st century: Their people skills, not technology."
5,Must read book on Networking,"Yes, the author does have a bit of an ego that can be somewhat annoying at times. But the advice in the book is very good. I've read many books about networking and this is one of the two best, along with ""Dig Your Well Before You're Thirsty"" by Harvey MacKay."
2,Another Self Help Book - Please Help,It is hard to take another book with all the answers to a sucessful career and a sucessful life. Will this one change your life? I doubt it but it will bore you and make you dull. Don't waste your time with this one find something of value to read.
2,Very Disappointed!,"So much of what is in here is pretty much the same old, same old. To compound it further, I found the narrator's voice sooooooooooooooooooooooo boring to listen to. Do not waste your money - if I could send it back, I would!"
4,Full of practical advice,"I've immediately put this book on my ""regularly re-read"" list. It's chock full of practical tips for building relationships that even naturally shy folks can easily put into practice.Truly successful people, like Keith Ferrazzi, know that relationships can make all the difference between goodness and greatness in a career (and in life).I highly recommend this book."
4,The Art of the Schmooze,"Largely autobiographical in nature, Keith Ferrazzi explains how business networking made him the success he is today.Ferrazzi has built his career on the successful management of his Rolodex, and presents a ""warts and all"" picture of his techniques. Especially helpful are the anecdotes showing how certain networking techniques he experimented with were dismal failures, and how he learned and adjusted.The standard business networking tips found in many business self-help books are explained in the first third of the book, what I particularly enjoyed were some of the more intermediate tips in the latter half of the book. For instance, what to do with your list of contacts and how to successfully manange it once you have accumulated a wealth of business relations and are well on your way up the career ladder.This book won't appeal to everyone, it tries to do too many things. Taken with a grain of a salt, it is nonetheless an enjoyable and easy business read."
1,a how-to for the would-be,"I can distill the information contained in this cynical and disgusting self-serving replica of a book down to two sentences:* If you are ""nice"" to people, they will ""like"" you.* If people ""like"" you, they will hire you!There, now you don't have to read the book."
1,Should have read the reviews,"I have to agree with the other reviews that indicate that the author does nothing except name drop throughout the entire book. Who cares how many superficial ""relationships"" that the author thinks he has cultivated? Not surprised he was so interested in getting to Hollywood. Absolutely, the worst business networking book I've ever read. In any case, I've learned to read the reviews posted before I make my purchases."
1,-FIREWOOD-,"Why would someone openly tell the public that they solicit their friends in order to bring in business? The book itself is mere self indulgence and instructions on how to have people over for dinner, but Ferrazzi calls it ""cloning an event"". HINT...not a good idea to write a book on being insincere and fake to people when its your job. Ferrazzi tactics are common sense and at times, unkind. My dog thanks you for the chew toy."
1,A book with no content,"Someone wrote a book on how to make ""friends"" and glorified himself the whole way through it, and even better I'm guessing he had his ""friends"" write reviews on how helpful it was. Impressive. I actually saw Mr. Ferrazzi speak out here on the east coast, and for an hour and a half he spoke about how to build relationships while speaking of every CEO/CMO/COO he's ever met, the book is much the same. He should of just made a list of names...Larry,Bob,Joseph,Bill,Christian,Henry,Donald, etc... I'm glad I kept my receipt."
2,"I'm Keith Ferrazzi, the most important person in the history of the universe!!",Keith Ferrazzi thinks he's SOOOO COOOLLL!!
5,Everyone should read this.,"If everyone in the world read this book, within 20 years we would solve world hunger, stop all wars, and be far enough in space to find aliens."
5,The playbook for building powerful relationships,"This book presents an insightful guide on how relationships can craft one's life and career. But importantly, it starts with identifying our true goals and passions and extends to cultivating a personal brand for ourselves.Keith not only tells his story in a direct and easy-to-read style, but shares the specific techniques he has learned and are so much a part of the way he operates. This stems from the fundamental idea that human connectivity is not only unavoidable, but essential in finding self-actualization.It's easy to cast off a book such as this as superficial. In fact, the title made me shy away until I had the chance to see Keith present a seminar early this year. He does drop names, and he does risk sounding like compete ego-maniac, but seeing him in person was powerful because he truly checked his vanity at the door. Readers should do the same if they want to get the most value out of this book, both in theory and later in practice."
3,Good tips but antiquated,"It is good but not updated with todays technology. Some of his advice is usefull but very common sense that just helps as a good reminder. I would say it is an ok book, but not missing anything special."
5,Great Book,This book is an easy read and insightful to how to properly network and make the most out of connections with people.
4,Personal Marketing,"This is a lengthy, but quite interesting, presentation of how immaginative some people can be at self promotion and it totally removes the embarrassment that is typically connected by the promoter to him or her self. This lets the self marketing move forward by leaps and bounds."
4,Good for the introvert,"It's a decent book and suggested reading by my brokerage firm. It does have good tips. The only criticism I have is all the name dropping. I see this in my own profession and often wonder whether it is a necessity. To me, it seems like a sign of insecurity but I am new."
5,Great Book. Great Ideas.,"Keith Ferrazzi obviously understands the importance of career karma. He practices what he preaches and provides countless examples of ways to be an effective networker, build your personal brand, and expand your success. This book helps destroy many networking myths and teaches us that the one important rule in networking is to 'give' to the members of your network. Keith has built his own personal brand on his unique and innate relationship-building skills and he shares with us so many different ways to network, that every reader will be able to find the ones that are authentic for them."
5,Masterful Networking Tactics,"Author Keith Ferrazzi is a master networker who claims that his Palm Pilot holds the names of 5,000 people who will take his phone calls. That's a powerful claim. Starting as a self-made man of humble origins, Ferrazzi developed his social network by helping people and by developing and mastering the techniques for networking. Here, he shares his methods. His light, engaging and entertaining story will motivate those who want to enhance their social and business friendships. The author advocates generosity as the key to success. That's a radical business concept, but he claims it works. It's certainly worth a try. We recommend this book to people who want to be more social, make friends and expand their business connections. It should also prove invaluable for those who are sick of sitting at home on Saturday nights."
1,Bragging or name dropping?,"I had a hard time reading this book with all the ""I'm so great and I know everyone, stories"". I realize its hard to pen a book but this was kind of a waste of my time.I wish I could recommend something better but I can not right now. Just skip it and read something else."
1,A book just written to sell,"This book was beyond basic, there was little in it that was worthwhile.Here are the two takeaways:1) Position yourself around great people2) Build authentic relationships aka don't be a networking jerk or sleaze ballDon't waste your time with this trash."
4,"Overall, quite useful; but, perhaps a bit too self-promoting","While I found Keith Ferrazzi's ""Never Eat Alone"" to be an informative and easy read, there were a somewhat annoying number of self-promoting excerpts early on and a bit too much bravado. Based on the success Mr. Ferrazzi has realized, one certainly shouldn't diminish what he has achieved and would likely be well advised to heed his advice. Perhaps what I have labelled as ""bravado and self-promotion"" is really just a high level of self-confidence infusing his narration. In any case, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in building mutually beneficial life long relationships or simply enhancing their networking skills. Much of what Mr. Ferrazzi espouses may be seen by some as common sense and good behavior. However, it never hurts to point out the obvious and the examples used throughout the text to reinforce his messages are excellent."
4,Less Unctous than I Feared,"When I first walked by this book in the bookstore I snickered at the title. Later that day, while I was eating lunch alone, I decided to research more on Amazon. I bought it, read it, and was pleasantly surprised. Although the book is quit thin in parts (developing a Network Action Plan is more of a scheme than a plan), it had many helpful insights.The author takes pains to point out that great networkers are only indirectly interested in expanding their own power or influence. What they primarily seek is contributing to the success of others, which in turn, should create a series of ""contacts,"" which range from business associates to genuine friends. It is not nearly as calculating as I feared, and the author is not as unctous and disingenous as I suspected. He doesn't lack for confidence, but he admits to his faults and offers some telling examples of what not do. Overall, a solid book that will help some loners."
5,"Simple, yet crucial changes for big results","As an entrepreneur, this book is invaluable in detailing the important aspect of building relationships. I love the focus on creating quality mutually beneficial relationships and not simply a ""networking"" how-to. Must buy and interesting read in general."
1,"Hardly ""revolutionary""","The book isn't that bad, but it isnt worth buying with so many other masters out there writing about how to get it done. Here's what's wrong....First, it's billed as ""revolutionary"" concepts which I found to hardly be true. Almost evey idea was something that I've read in a Covey, Mackay, Peters, etc book. Recycled.Further, he's so proud of his accomplishments it becomes exhausting to keep up with all the great things KF did in his life.Finally, he writes often about how he was from poor, underprivileged family and he had nothing but his ""revolutionary"" concepts to break him into The Club. I believe it at first, until he started (and then repeated) to tell the reader about how he went to a private elementary and HS, then to Yale and Harvard BS. He was IN the club from first grade - hardly a life course that demonstrated how unique and terrific his practices were."
3,He has some good points.,"He really has something to say, but he stresses too much on his personal accomplishments. The book seems to me very egocentric. He is also very subjective and ambiguous in some of his maxims. Sometimes I had the feeling that this book is part of his networking tools, using it to promote himself and friends. But there is good information in this book; you just have to bear with the style to extract it."
2,"Self-serving, self-aggrandizing, and self-advertisement.","This book was written to add one more bullet to Keith Ferrazzi's list of accomplisments. The ideas are superficial, hardly revolutionary, and not much different from the simple epiphanies that come into one's life at one point or another. To my surprise, for as many 'connections' as the author seems to have, I don't recall any of them providing any direct advice/quote(s) for the book. There's too much arrogance in this book to leave one enlightened. There are some feeble attempts at balancing his ego, but I would be hard pressed to believe that they came from Mr. Ferrazzi himself."
2,Blah blah blah,"Goodness, this book was full of name dropping and seriously shameless self promotion. I did not finish it."
4,Good Intro for Newbies,"I wish I could give 3.5 stars for this. Four seems a little generous, but three seems too harsh.This book offers a great networking overview for those not too familiar with the subject. I agree with all the points.However, for a passionate student of networking, I was looking for more examples of how to deal with tricky situations, which this book did not really address.I also prefer Harvey Mackay's more concise style of explaining the activity. His little Rolodex book is such a nice, quick overview.Thus, if you're semi-experienced at networking, you can gain a few points from this book but probably nothing surprising. On the other hand, if you are more of an amateur, this book provides a thorough introduction."
5,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, it'll change your life.","Well maybe not the crying part, but 2 outta 3 ain't bad. This puts Rich Dad Poor Dad to shame. An page-turning insight into the community of the wealthy, while promoting integrity, honesty and the benefits of helping others. I loved this from the first chapter to the last. My highest recommendation."
4,worth checking out,"Worth reading if you're in need of some motivation from the perspective of the world of business. The book preaches the value of social networking and great ways to get started doing it. Like they say, 'it's not what you know, it's who you know,' and that seems to be the main theme behind Never Eat Alone."
4,"great reference, tough read","This book is a refreshing view of networking and is filled with innovative techniques that Ferrazzi has proven successful. However, it is much like reading a repair manual. To get the most out of this book I had to employ Ferazzi's excruciating practice of making endless notes and lists to keep my thoughts straight. Iview it as a manual rather than a novel. Either way, its content is sure to pay dividends."
3,Use your friends to get what you want,Some good ideas but not quite what I was looking for. It turned out to be more of a self-help business manual on How are you? To cultivate contacts as friends and vice versa - rather cynical (I felt) but maybe that's the American Way...
4,Great tips,This book falls into that category of business books that you can quickly scan different areas as you go through and take the best parts and leave the rest. It did feel a bit bloated in certain parts and there were a few too many personal stories - though good and applicable to the point the authors were making - for my tastes. If you'd like a good networking book with a 'you can do it attitude' this is a good choice. I also had a guest feature it at 27Goodthings.com as a good read.
3,50 pages of good advice in 300 pages of book,"Poor Ferrazzi, a staunch Republican from Yale who found himself while meditating for 10 days in silence and quiet contemplation. Too bad the rest of us can't do the same rich-guy's trick.So, network ruthlessly, but think of PEOPLE first, but nothing is sacred, from church to probably hitting on pallbearers. lots of common sense that not only SEEMS to repeat itself, but does, twice or more, in this waster of paper that is cowritten with (i.e.: spoken to) somebody else. Frequent referrals to Carnegie and lots of stuff that acts as reinforcement of stuff we know rather than anything that will blow you away. But yes, it is full of good ideas; you just needed to be pointed to many of them again.If you choose to read it as I did, with a notebook and pencil with frequent write-downs of pay numbers and pointers, you'll be able to resell it on amazon and REALLY feel smarter!"
1,too basic,"some good ideas but would expect a book like this to sell for $4.00 to $6.00. Here is the gist of the book: middle class childhood and was able to get into Yale where he met people, became friends and kept in touch with. Guess what, he was able to tap the network and help himself... wow who knew? So, if you are going to a City college you might no be meeting the ""right"" people. Seriously, for those with no clue about being social, this book may help them. Marketing can be learned... many of us (even experienced markeing people) at time can be a wall flower. Don't fret, just follow up and talk about things other than work.... kids, pets, sports, etc."
2,Underwhelmed...,"After significant media PR, I went out and bought this book. Like that great movie your friends (the media) say that you have to see, this one is a pass. After you cut through the fluff, there are two important concepts to be taken away from this book: 1) always be networking and 2) the most effective way to network is to think about how many ways you can give value, provide leads, or be of service to those in your professional network - this goodwill granted will come back to you in spades."
2,Annoying and Useless,"There is little solid advice in this book. The author spends most of the pages talking about himself, his company, his previous company, his very important friends (there are hundreds of them apparently), his parents and....do you see where this is going?Skip this one."
2,Not Someone I Would Want to Eat With,"There are some good tips in here and it is worth a quick review.However, the author comes across as shallow, name dropping ego maniac; I would rather eat alone than share a meal with him. My favorite part of the book comes up right after you have read enough to figure out just what a blow hard he is. Chapter 6, The Networking Jerk, describes how he used to be a self-obsessed bore until an executive coach straightened him out. He even gives her name, not recognizing that the obvious lack of success she had with him is not exactly a ringing endorsement for her work."
1,Come on Keith...,"This is nothing but an ""I"" book. Mr.Ferrazz""I"" just toots his own horn. ""I"" this and ""I"" that."
3,"Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time","This book/cd contains a wealth of infomation. For my personality, the networking style suggested throughout the book/cd does not fit for me. Of course, there were gold nuggets that I noted to incorporate into my networking style. I ended up passing it on to my district manager, who is more suited to this style, for his road trip. J."
1,"he should kiss the A of Amazon, i can not get my money back","Lucky guy, i can not have a refund on Kindle book, he should kiss the A of Amazon on Daily basis.Nothing Unique, his life and over various jobs or what he did. only title is good Never Eat Alone. Sole message of the book network"
3,I had much higher expectations,"I was looking for a little bit more substance than this book provided. It seemed like all he was concerned about was including a few tips but filling this book with just simple, ""name dropping"". I'm not sure I took away a lot but it did inspire me to evaluate myself more in my quest to add to my rolodex. So, in summary, it was a good idea for a book, just doesn't deliver much."
4,The Relationship Approach,"I was in the middle of reading Keith's book and took it with me on a recent cruise vacation. I recognized the same book being read by a fellow traveler and introduced myself. We chatted about the book and our businesses and exchanged business cards. The presence of the book itself was the perfect introduction to our conversation! Fun, fabulous, and completely natural is how I would describe Keith Ferrazzi's approach to building a network as wide (and deep) as you want."
5,Outstandingly written and meticulously researched,"I'll be honest. I'm the toughest of critics. It's hard to impress a professional writer, amateur historian, former English teacher, and all around pirate enthusiast. This book is truly outstanding in the field of historical non-fiction. It delivers not only an engaging writing style but also the thorough historical research. I'm not convinced I needed to know down to the last barrel the cargo of each ship Kidd and his men took as prizes, but if you want that level of detail this book provides it along with a ripping narrative that tells the story so important when writing history. Enjoyed every page. Wish all pirate books were this well done.Five stars, well deserved!!!"
4,Captain Kidd,"I have read a lot of pirate books. Most of them spend to much time on general pirate lore and activities and don't focus more on ""the"" pirate the book is supposed to be about. This is one of the best ones I've read. It manages to cover the essentials of pirate life without over doing it. And the story of Captain Kidd is a very interesting read. This privateer ""turned"" pirate was one of the earliest examples of corrupt political agendas and scapegoating. This book does a great job of covering the story of Captain Kidd from beginning to end. And for most, will probably surprise you. I know the stories I heard and things I ""knew"" about Kidd were all wrong! If you like maritime history or books on pirates, this is a great book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Of all the pirate/privateer books I read I'd say this is the second best. I've read about 7 or 8 so far. I don't think anyone reading this book will be disappointed."
4,Really Good !,"Not only is the poignant story of Captain Kidd's life fascinating, this book yields a rich compendium of information concerning:*The importance of piracy to the American colonies*The incredible global nature of it*The very common practice of legalized piracy (privateers) between warring nations of the time*And the importance of the Caribbean Wars, their impact on Europe and the Americas.Well written and researched, this book is a bit of an eye opener, one you will be glad you spent time with."
5,* A Compelling Ride Through Capt. Kidd's True Adventures *,"For centuries, pirates like Captain Kidd have been portrayed in 'fairytale' fashion on the big screen and in literature. Finally now someone has done enough extensive research to compile a more accurate portrayal of pirate history, life onboard ship, and the life of the great Captain William Kidd, who was not the man we knew from fiction. Disney movies and candy-coated stories are fine for kids, but ""The Pirate Hunter"" actually skips back in time to the gritty life that pirates lived in the late 1600s. Zacks doesn't hold back. America, and the rest of the world was a different place 300 years ago. Packed with enough facts and documented accounts to please any historian, blended seamlessly with segues, and flavored with dramatical asides, ""The Pirate Hunter"" is a truely entertaining read!"
3,Entertaining,"I found this work to be a rather entertaining read, and I enjoyed the writing style of the author in general. At many points during the ""story"", I found myself almost rooting for Kidd to turn pirate as this might have prolonged his life for awhile longer. My criticism of this work is that it reads far too much like an adventure novel. I'm sure that the majority of facts and even most opinions presented here are duly supported, but the author takes considerable license in relating to us how Kidd felt, or how rip-roaring drunk he got, etc. It is virtually impossible for us to know these important features and characteristics of Kidd's life with the surviving evidence from 300+ years past. The occasional embellishment does make for a more compelling read, but one should take it with a grain of salt. Otherwise, The Pirate Hunter is a thoroughly enjoyable work."
2,Not as Good as I thought it Would Be,"In short, I was disappointed. I was looking for a great adventure, and found myself getting bogged down by the author's penchant for skipping around in different times. For example, you're reading about two pirates and have been reading about them for some time, when suddenly he states, ""in fact, they had met some time before..."" and then goes to another chapter about what occurred ten years before. He does this several times and I found it disconcerting, and in some cases, boring. This author also has a way of stating an unpleasantry in a blunt and vulgar manner, that looks like he's attempting to shock you. I didn't appreciate that.Read Batavia's Graveyard, The Ice Master, or any other ""sea adventure,"" before choosing this one."
3,Interesting facts about pirate life,"The most interesting aspect of this book is the early pre-USA history that it contains. It shows the struggles that English were having with their own government and justice system and why many families would choose to move to an unknown country to get away from it. After they were here for a while and the same struggles started rearing their ugly heads, they chose to revolt. Hence - the Declaration of Independence about 60 years after the setting of this book.As far as the pirate story goes, I'd have to agree with another reviewer that the facts are given with far more detail than would could possibly glean from reading a few sparse documents. The author tends a little bit towards raw language that I didn't find necessary for the subject. It is a good read, though. I ran through it in less than a week. Captain Kidd must have been an amazing leader!"
5,Bluegrass at it's best,"Having both been members of Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver, Lou Reid and Terry Baucom have produced a fine strong effort here reminiscent of the Quicksilver sound. Great banjo, driving bass and nice vocal harmonies. Highly recommended for any bluegrass collection however it's becoming rare."
1,VERY LONG AND WINDING,"Much information with random connections. Can this music teacher really comprehend our ways? He seems to think he's got it all figured out, but maybe instead he should write less and make more music. Some noble drumming might make a savage out of him too."
2,This purchase was a bad idea.,"When I first tried incorporating the ""M-Audio Firewire Solo US35030 Firewire Audio Interface"" into my system, I was greatly disappointed. My home studio is run by Mac OS X 10.5.6, and this product was definitely not made for a Mac. The software and drivers were both out of date. Also, if you plug in the module while your computer is on, not only will it not work, but you actually run the risk of disabling that connection without an easy fix (So, the Firewire Out port on the interface won't work with the same Firewire port on your Mac anytime in the future (Or so the manual said).That said, when it's not causing problems, it works alright (just not great).With Windows, I can't comment. However, I do suggest that you go with a USB interface anyway."
1,Not very impressed!,"I consider myself rather knowledgeable when it comes to computers but I must say the driver issue with the M-Audio audio interface makes me rate this product a 1 star. When I rebooted my computer, I would have to go back in and reconfigure the device which took away my time to actually record with it. Fortunately, Amazon allowed me full credit when I returned it. I now have the Line 6 Tone Port UX1 and it does everything I need with no latency and USB 2 interface."
1,Terrible Product!,"No stars would be more appropriate for this device which constantly disconnects itself from the computer, plays audio only when it wishes to do so. The software that comes with it is terrible and the drivers are not fully compatible with Windows (despite their claim). Unless you want to put up with having to restart the Windows Audio Services every time your computer goes to sleep or having to restart your computer whenever M-Audio decided it is time please don't buy this monstrousity."
2,Watch out for Macintosh Drivers,"Each day I have to reboot my machine because the audio outputs either stop working or start to pick up a lot of noise/static. Searching around the internet seems to indicate M-Audio drivers for OS X are not to be held in high regard.If you havea Mac, I would think twice about buying M-Audio audio interfaces. (For the record, I have OS X 10.4.11)."
5,Great value.,"I'm very impressed. A lot of features and flexibility packed into a small and inexpensive package.I installed it on a WinXP(SP2) machine which had Adobe Audition on it, and the M-Audio drivers and software were fully integrated into Audition automatically. Very slick. Made some nice home-studio recordings within an hour of opening the box.The only startup difficulty was in realizing that there were way more options than I expected for to routing inputs to outputs, so picking the right combination of software settings to simply make a recording from one mono mic seemed a bit more complicated that it needs to be. Took me a whole extra 10 minutes of reading the included PDF-format manual :)."
2,Unreliable,"This thing has given me endless headaches. It's not clear whether it's just glitchy or if it's poorly supported by my Mac laptop. Sometiems the output ports are available, sometimes they aren't. Sometiems the inputs work, sometimes they don't. The nature of the problems is hard to discover/troubleshoot. Sometimes a restart fixes the problem, sometimes it doesn't.When it works, it works well."
5,Awesome equipment!,Bought this thing out of desperation. Was getting a low level background hiss running the mixer through the sound card and at my wits end bought this interface. WOW! Absolutely NO background artifact and amazing recording clarity. Easy to set up easy to use. Bought it thinking I would be returning it... no way! I'm keeping this baby!
5,Passionate Artistic Achievement,"George Dalaras sings with sensitivity and passion expressing the Greek soul and capturing truths about life. The roots of the music are from ancient Byzantium despite being played on modern instruments and having current lyrics. The poetic translations in the liner notes express the depth and intense nature of each song. The artistry is unsurpassed. Like a painting in words, his sensuous voice melds with the exotic Greek music appealing to the listener on all levels.""Running Roads"" is another masterpiece, every single track is full of feeling and depth, a full expression of life. This is my fourth Dalaras CD, I have ""The Very Best of George Dalaras"", ""50 Hronia Rembetiko"", & ""I Megalitgres Epithies"": all are equally excellent. This CD demonstrates why George Dalaras CDS have sold over 7 million world-wide. 7 million people can not be wrong, his music touches the soul, no need to understand Greek to appreciate the music, it has universal appeal! Erika Borsos (erikab93)"
3,Can't win 'em all...,"I am a huge George Dalaras fan. Seeing the new album, my first thought was ""Great!"" Then I saw that Sting was on the album and bought it without a second thought. If you are not familiar with Dalaras' music, this album is easy to listen to, but if you're looking for the emotion and power of his earlier albums, you may be disappointed. I was. And, if you already own some of his albums, you'll hear some of the same cuts. Glad to own it, but I find myself listening to his earlier music (""A Portrait,"" ""The Very Best Of,"" ""Unplugged"") instead."
4,GREAT story!,Just finished reading REUNION. What a GREAT sotry. I just fell in love with Connor and Taylor and the whole family. Thanks to Ms. Ball for writing this book and I look forward to more of them from her!
5,Thanks for adding to my reading pleasure!,I read REUNION and was greatly blessed. I hope there will be other books from Karen Ball in the future. Thanks to Ms. Ball for adding to my reading pleasure.
