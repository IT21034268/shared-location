1,2 Years and Dead,"I purchased an Akai LCT3201AD from Sam's Club a couple years ago and at first, it looked good and sounded good especially for the price. Shut it off one night only to come back and find that I have sound and no picture. Akaiusa won't return emails and I am out the cost of a TV. If you are considering this product spend a little more and get a quality product. Check consumer affairs or type ""LCT3201AD no picture"" into your browser to see how they've treated others."
1,Check out internet for power supply failures before you buy this tv,"We bought this TV for our assisted living facility. Just months after the warranty was up, it started turning off by itself. Will run for a while then begins turning itself off immediatly after you turn it back on. If you look this model up on the internet, you'll find that this is a problem experienced by a LOT of Akai TV purchasers. I highly recommend against this product as it appears to be a problem with both the product and a company that doesn't stand behind it's product. Check out www.fixya.com for owners of this tv that are out a good bit of money with no support from the company."
3,Beautiful or Boring? It depends...,"Making Paper is an album of spare, hypnotic piano music coupled with Richard Young's thin, lilting vocals. For me, it's the perfect album to listen to as I drift off to sleep. But for you, that might be the problem. I know people who find this album excruciatingly dull and repetitious. But fans of minimalistic, composed music will appreciate its beauty."
4,Bill Callahan....Get it? Get it!,"This is probabaly my least favorite song on woke on a waleheart, but is still good! The B-side is good Carribean music, I guess.I recommend the W.O.A.WH cd it grows on ya greatly, That i give 5 ***** Smog/Bill Callahan is essential listening folks.Get w/ IT! Get it?"
4,What can I say?,"Another Spongebob DVD, and it's great. 9 hilarious episodes, 2 that have yet to air on TV (Born Again Krabs and I Had an Accident). The only reason it doesn't get all 5 stars is because of the special features. There's the Underwater Sun music video, with scenes from the episodes on the DVD, and Drawing the Goo Lagoon, a boring segment in which a background artist...well...draws the Goo Lagoon. Special features aside, this DVD is worth getting just because of the great episodes."
5,Love it,I love having these episodes on dvd so that I can pop them in for my daughter whenever and she is ok
4,Nothing is more F.U.N than Spongebob and the gang.,"I'll be short and sweet. This DVD is so funny and includes some really great episodes. The new episodes are so hilarious. They were a real treat to see before they are shown on TV in March. I just wish they had included more episodes and in order of the air date. I just hope they don't sneak some sorta SPONGE BOB SEASON ONE on us, that would truly make these DVD's a waste of money. Anyway, I can't wait for the next one (March 4th) keep em Coming Nickelodeon/Paramount and I'll keep buying!!"
4,"Oops- Wrong story! Also, ending is too violent!","I like this DVD, but one of the episodes on this DVD, ""I Had an Accident"" has an impossible focus and a violent ending. Sponges are so soft and even when dry, they are not at all fragile. How could SpongeBob smash into pieces in the first place? This applies more to an egg(like Humpty Dumpty)or to a glass bottle than to a sponge like SpongeBob! Also, the part when the gorilla attacks Sandy and Patrick is too violent! They should have had the gorilla act like a giant(stepping on or trying to eat Sandy and Patrick)instead of the insane behavior the gorilla performs!"
4,As far as textbooks go...,I used this textbook for a Creative Psych class in my M.A. program and as far as textbooks go it was good. It had a lot of useful information that was presented in an easy to understand format. If you have an interest in this subject this is a very good book and is excellent for really all careers fields from teacher to r & d this has amazing insights into human creativity.
4,Amazing prog-ish aor rock and roll...,"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this was available on cd. I had this on cassette back in '88. At the time, the video for the song ""Sound Of A Breaking Heart"" was being played on MTV. Yes, back when MTV played a variety and not just the top 40 stuff. Lead vocalist Russell Acara sings his ass off on this cd. Over all it's more AOR oriented, less heavy metal. Some of the songs even have some prog-rock elements.This cd release also features a cool cover of Deep Purple's ""Hard Lovin' Man"" as a bonus track.The top tracks for me are:""Sound Of A Breaking Heart"", ""Cycle Of The Moon"", and ""Can't Hide Love""."
5,"You gotta have this one, Stooge fans","These three Western comedies (all with Shemp Howard) are among the Three Stooges' best shorts. OUT WEST and MERRY MAVERICKS are very enjoyable, and PUNCHY COWPUNCHERS is outstanding, with a sterling supporting cast and some riotous acrobatics by Jock Mahoney (the dauntless but clumsy cowboy who takes spectacular pratfalls). Guaranteed laughs for comedy fans."
1,Only Two Stories of Heroism,"Had I known that more than half of this anthology is nothing but hunters bragging about how they shot already wounded animals, I still would have bought this book for the other stories, including the hippo & croc ones but most notably Lion Attack! (""[W]ith the incredible bravery of the desperate, [Lee] threw himself on the lioness barehanded, punching and scratching to make the big cat drop his wife"") and I Will Save You! (""Running toward [his wife's] Vina's screams...[Elfas] smacked the lioness over the back until the broom handle splintered.""). As for (most of) the hunters, however, the braggadocio of their 'exploits' left me rooting for the animals!"

4,"Awesome Book -- a review by Dominic, age 9","The Time Warp Trio (Fred, Sam, and Joe) warp into the future. In the year 2095 they end up in a museum, the same museum that they were in, except in the future. They try to get back to their own time (1995). They run into some weird people, such as director Green and Uncle Joe. The problem in this story is that Fred, Sam, and Joe can't find the book. The book is the thing that allows them to go into the future and past, like a time machine.This book is awesome because it is the only one I know of that goes into the future. In the past you already know what happened because you can just look it up in some history book. But the future is unexpected. I thought that the idea of the going into the future was great. This book was the first time warp trio book I ever read, and then I read some more because it dragged me into the series. If you like time warping I think you will want to read 2095."
3,The book was good but sad.,The book had interesting parts but it wasen't all that great.It;s about a kid an his grampa that own a dog and a potato farm. Drew Migett Mike Miles
4,good for kids all ages,I tought that it was a good book because I like when they were in the musame in they use the magic squre to get out in went to 2095.They met a robot lady who thout they were someone eles in til the real kids show up.thenone of the boys did a magic tick to stall time but then it got braing so they letf.to get the magic sqarebut it was outside. SO THEY RUST TO GET THERE.
1,Horrible,"I read this book one year ago, at age 11, and was truly dissapointed in it. I thought that the plot of the book made absolutely no sense and I believe it is was to short to even be called a children's book. I was so surprised when it was even nominated for a children's book award."
1,2095 (Time Warp Trio) - not for me,I didnt' like this book. It flip flopped around and got confusing and I got frustrated.
4,This 8 year old book is better than Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6.,"I was reading Rainbow 6 when I picked up this 8 year old paperback. It was 3 days before I put it down again. I was in the action from page one and Sherlock twisted and weaved the adventure and plot to keep me guessing all the way to the end. A great novel that escaped a lot of attention, but I interrupted a Tom Clancy novel to finish this one. Heartily recommended. I shall find other Sherlock books and see if they meet the same rapid pace of this one. Review by Igor."
1,Not worth it at 1/4 of the price ..,"Some of the most factually incorrect rubbish I have ever read. Weak plot, extremely weak characters. Something Wilbur Smith would have turned out in primary school."
1,Little People Lil' Kingdom,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas and did not work- even after exchanging the batteries many times. My complaint is not so much on the toy as it is Etoys. After contacting them, they said they would send another one. It is January 9th today. My daughter has forgotten about her toy now and I still don't have another one.I contacted Etoys about a refund instead- well, they have not answered back"
4,Why does it cost more to be pink?,"My daughter has the Little People Lil' Kingdom Castle. She got it last Christmas before Fisher Price came out with a special PINK edition they could market to girls. It is, essentially, the same toy as the Little People Lil' Kingdom Castle. So why is this priced $1 higher?"
4,great toy...be wary of online prices,"my daughter received this castle for christmas this year and just loves it. it's a great toy for role-playing and imaginative play. one warning though..as i was searching for accessories online, i naturally checked amazon first. however, i was astounded to see the price of the castle set. my mother payed $27 for this toy at toys'r us and only $7 for the maid marion accessory. it was not on sale nor any promo for the holiday. shop around, you don't need to spend over sixty dollars for this set!"
5,An excellent read...and I am not a skeptic.,"I read Fate and Fortian Times every month so I am definitely not a skeptic and fully expected to hate this book. The typical ""skeptical inquirer"" is a closed minded snob and ultimately just as silly as the most gullible ""believer"". However, Nickell is an exception. He approaches his cases open minded and without an attitude.Most important is that this book is a fun read. The topic rarely attracts such coherent yet enjoyable writing. I had a blast reading it."
2,Not a good book even if you don't believe in the paranormal,"I picked this book up at my local library on a whim, boy was I disappointed. While in some cases Mr. Nickell did appear to do a decent job of researching the selected subjects in some cases I think he let his own opinion take over. I don't require that a book find every, or even any, story to be true but I do want things to be approached in a respectful, thorough manner. In some of these things Nickell does a pretty good job of digging things out, in others he's more of an it doesn't seem likely type and doesn't dig enough for me. He can be pretty rough on his critics and his subjects (most of us would be) maybe even meaner than he says they are. I want an investigative book to look into things with an open careful attitude even if it doesn't give the result I want. You don't get that here, I think Mr. Nickelll went into it with an attitude of it's all fake and I WILL prove it so, that goes too far for me."
2,"Not skeptic at all, but total non believer","Nickell trys to call himself a skeptic but he is not at all, in fact he is an all out non believer who even when he has no evidence that things are a hoax or natural he deems them so based on his past experiences. His writing often makes fun of others and he even uses his books to ridicule and degrade other writers in the field which I percieve to be jealousy on his part."
5,The ONLY cookbook,"I was actually looking to buy a copy of this cookbook for my sister and sister-in-law when I came across Weaver's on amazon. I absolutely love their store and buy all of my home cooking and canning supplies from them! HIGHLY recommend this seller. Now to the cookbook itself. I had ten other cookbooks before buying this one from Weaver's Market and now I only have one. It is used so often in my kitchen that it even has a special holder on the counter. Every recipe that I have made from this book has been delicious and my picky family will eat each meal every time. The ingredient list is usually made up of things that most family kitchen's have on hand, the recipes are easy to follow, and are easy to substitute ingredients for. Whether you are beginning to cook or have some years behind you, this is a MUST have for your kitchen. As I said, I love mine so much, that I am buying copies for my sister and sister-in-law."
4,Mixed Reviews,"I originally bought this for my teen son with moderate acne because of the good reviews. After about 10 weeks of daily use (morning only) there was no improvement. I decided he needed something stronger. Didn't want to waste the rest of the bottle, so I started using it (40 year old female, mild acne). It works wonderfully! I have dry, sensitive skin and this has not irritated it at all. Leaves me feeling clean and clear! It has a nice lemony scent. Bottom line, I recommend for mild acne, but not moderate or severe. Amazon has the best price!"
5,You Have to Like R Crumb to Enjoy this Flick!,"It was the early '70s, I was running headshops in Houston and Atlanta when R Crumb first hit the scene with his type of ""head comix."" He joined a group of very cool, open minded, unusual comic artists who created a new industry that was first presented in head shops. The movie covers a lot of his early days, spends a lot of time on his family and personal relationships that also helped develop his style. I can't recommend this video for just anyone, you gotta like this type of stuff or you might find the video borning."
2,Too Much Information,"You remember Mr. Natural and Fritz the Cat, don't you? Zap Comix? All those females with exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics? Yeah, that Crumb: R. Crumb, Robert Crumb.This is clearly a case of TMI: way, way too much information. Too much depressing information."
4,An American Original,"Do you know that impressed me most about Robert Crumb? The way he could brush aside incredibly remunerative offers without even hesitating. Sad, isn't it? This artist refuses to adhere to the American ideal of ""anything for money"". . .which is probably why he's living in France right now. This is the sad, startling, exhilarating story of his life and circumstance and about how art can enable a person to overcome his (extremely abnormal) background. I saw it twice in the theater and bought the video as soon as it appeared on the shelves; I've seen it many, many times. R. Crumb himself is still a puzzle, but the purpose of this movie isn't to dissect one man's life for a tabloid-sated audience; it examines the sources and purpose of art itself."
5,Great documentary,"Fascinating film about the comic artist and his work, whose ideas revolutionized underground comics in the 60's, and whose influence is still being felt today. Even so notable an art historian as Robert Hughes says Crumb is the Bosch or Brueghel of our age. Based on this film, I would say Robert is actually the most normal of the three sons! He is also surprisingly articulate about his work in addition to his great artistic abilities. Despite the off-beat subject matter, I found this to be one of the finest documentaries I've ever seen. There is not one dull moment in the entire film, and some of the scenes are truly memorable. Definitely worth your attention if you haven't seen it yet."
5,"Intense, no-holds-barred documentary","Great art should make you feel something, and this film makes a lot of viewers squirm in discomfort during certain scenes. Not because it's gross or disgusting, but simply because it's so unflinching in it's observation of this artist's life. Highly recommended. . ."
4,"Disturbing, but interesting to some","This movie gives you a good look at the personality of Crumb, his work, his family, and his past. Along the way it can be pretty dark, especially regarding his family, but you can't turn away. They don't try and hide the fact that he isn't exactly a likable guy. I love documentaries, especially films that focus on an individual. It was well done."
4,Angels Edgar Cayce,"You must get past the opening chapter when the author uses some questionable A + B = C ( just because). However, having said that- I cannot recommend this book highly enough. There are life concepts in this book that I have never considered and have changed my life dramatically. The take away--- We are one with God, our desires and words have the power to create for good or for evil. Were mankind to channel his desires away from the self-self-materialistic way- the world our true desires would create would be heaven on earth. As we all have the power to create, we all have the responsibility not to create evil. Read the book, it is time well spent and may even make a difference. It did for me."
2,"It's more like Robert J. Grant on Angels, Archangels, and the Unseen Forces than Cayce",I have read a lot of cayce and there is many part of the book thatdoesn't ring right! it is all open to interpretations.Other than that it was interesting in some areas.Blavatsky needs definitely a closer look...after much reading I find Steiner to be good but the other oneis definitely another story. it is a personal journeyso get the book and find out for yourself.Be good my friends
5,Really wonderful.,"Lots of stories of Cayce's information about angels. Comparisons of his information on angels like Archangel Michael vs. other's information from centuries past. A very smooth flowing, interesting read."
4,Makes FIguring out when....easy!,"You might need to know your yard needs Nitrogen...but when is the best time to add the fertilizer?How often should I trim my roses?When is the best time to plant shrubs?In categories including bulbs, roses, shrubs, trees and yards, you will learn the best time to do the various tasks of maintaining a beautiful yard and garden. For those of us in Texas (or similar zones) it's an essential guide that deals with our warm winters and hot summers.I love it! Very helpful information that I refer to regularly to know what needs to be done 'this month'.Not designed to be a colorful rendition on plants, if you're looking for a picture-book, this is not for you. But it's well organized and easy to read or browse. There are lists of plants that do well in our area, with some warnings of plants that don't do well, say, in the panhandle, where the climate is different.Unless you're a master gardener, or even if you are, this would be a beneficial guide."
5,A Wonderful Guide - Especially for We Compulsives,"As a true gardening moron, this book gives me hope that I can successfully grow plants without taking medication to assuage my anxiety. I like to know how, when and why and Groom's book covers all those bases. Divided into sections on annuals, perennials, trees, shrubs, etc., each section takes you from January to December telling you what to do each month. For me, this takes an overwhelming task - How to Garden - and breaks it into managable, understandable tasks."
2,Adequate for beginners,Very general information. Good if you are just looking for a quick reference but not if you are really into gardening. If you have an above average intrest in gardening you will already know the information in this book. It is nice to have everything laid out monthly but the 10 chapters are separated by area or type of plants so that you have to look 10 different places to see all the info for that month. The information is straight forward and easy to understand but too basic for me.
3,"Okay quality, good standup","Long lost stand up by Martin Lawrence. Bought it on Amazon because I could not find it anywhere else. The DVD I received was a Blockbuster copy. Used, but it worked. Nothing spectacular, but the DVD was shipped promptly"
1,Garbage,"One of the absolute WORST stand up shows I've ever had the misfortune of watching. I was hoping for a few laughs, but what I got was an uneducated sounding napolean complex having ignorant fool giving black people a bad name."
2,Martin has lost it!!!,"I would have expected more from Martin especially since his old stuff was beyond funny. It seemed as if he has become more of a violent. The entire show the only thing that he uses is profanity and talks about how you should beat the <heck> out of this and out of that. It would have been ok if it would have been one or two jokes about beating the children and etc. but more than half the show he talks about whippen someones <rear> and after about 15 min. of it, i got sick of listening to him. I don't know what has happened to Martin but the only thing that was interesting was close to the end when he explains about why he got arrested on the street and in the club and the only thing that caused all that was drugs... and to be honest i was wondering if he was on drugs through the entire show!!! Not worth it and if keeps on with this pace, i seriously doubt it that he will still be on the top!"
1,Wow...,"Wow...Martin Lawrence has gotten progressivly worse since leaving ""Martin"". He had something going with that. Anyhow, this is the LEAST funny stand-up routine EVER. I would underline the word ever in the previous sentence if I could I figure out how. The humor extremely low-brow. Not suggested viewing for any one with I.Q. of over 85. Martin at one point says ""Critics are people that dont have the talent to do anything else"" or something along those lines. This is not true. Critics are people that let alert other of people with no talent, such as Martin Lawrence. I saw this for free, and it still wasnt worth it."
1,Dreadful Comedy,"Martin Lawrence, one of the truly funny men in entertainment today, has lost his lively, fun-loving nature in this deadfully ponderous and un-funny movie. In addition to his manner and mien, which are cold, arrogant, unkind and un-funny, the comedic material is weak and the flow and ramble is awkward and stilted. Something bad has happened to Martin and it shows here, as his easy way with the audience in his stand-up routines has given way to an embarassed, chip-on-my-shoulder attitude that is off-putting at its best. I walked out after 45 minutes."
1,terrible,"A man who makes predictable, stupid, and boring movies performs predictable, stupid and boring stand up"
4,Hilarious DVD,"Martin Lawrence is a great stand-up performer. Great DVD, a lot of positive messages related to the regular behavior of the man in the society. A lot os fun. I couldn't stop laughing."
2,wheels fall off?,"it's a good thing I rented this DVD and didn't buy it. It does have some hilarious parts early I will admit. But as an over all show, it was a bit of a downer. He kept on urging the audience to ""ride this mother till the wheels fall off"" and how he kept giving his true holywood story which was kind of a contradiction because his wheels almost did fall off. I dig Martin L. and I am glad he is alive and I hope he continues to make us laugh. But after 20 minutes of this show I really wasn't laughing. But I will continue to buy and stay interested in Martin."
3,Enjoyed,"I enjoyed this a lot. I will admit his first live movie ""you so crazy was funnier"", but I laughed so much watching this. His take on the who Martin Luther King being peaceful made me think he had been in my head, but I don't want to give anything away for people who never saw it. You get to see Martin Lawrence as a man, not just an entertainer. Very enjoyable. Will watch again and add to my collection of DVD's of comedians for sure."
2,Great If You Wanna Hear A Grown Man Whine!,"Martin Lawrence is highly talented and funny why he did this awful standup and various other floops (ie. Black Knight) will have comedy historians guessing for centuries. Simply put, there was really only one funny part in Runteldat, the part when he was mimicking a drunkard having a onesided conversation with his wife. Other than that, Martin was whining and complaining about the bad press he's been getting. And the media has been singling him out and giving him the shaft but why commit an entire hour to talking about that I mean good grief. Martin's other standup's have been stellar but this one kinda stunk."
2,You Won't Run Tel Your Freinds About This!,"Im sorry, but i was expecting this to be so funny, something to follow up ""You So Crazy"", but it wasn't even close. He spends most of time talking about his struggles and his problems and run-ins with the law, i laughed a couple times, but basically he spent to much time talking about one subject and it got boring, especially about alcoholism, if your a fan of Martin you'll probably check it out anyway, but don't expect much laughs, i would rent it first. It's to vulger for kids and contains alot of adult matter."
1,Huge waste of time,I'm so glad I only rented this dvd. Talk about a waste of time and $3 -- I wanted my $3 and 90 minutes back. PLEASE don't waste your time with this. It's just not funny. At all.
1,Brutal on a new level,"I was such a big Martin fan after the TV show and his first comedy album (I actually bought it on cassette tape!) So I eagerly bought this one. It starts very good with a movie like re-cap of his career.BUT then...He gets on stage and he seems to think that saying the word Mother Effer is a punchline, because he must say these two words at least twice per sentence on average. It loses its kick very quickly. He just really didn't tell any well put together jokes. It was all attitude and arrogance.Personally I felt like I was watching a cocky open micer trying to impress everyone by how much he could curse. You don't even hear the audience laughing during the performance."
1,Not compatible,I was unable to play the dvd because it was not compatible to my Sony. I wish the this would have been displayed somewhere when reading the product description.
1,Martin Lawrence Live Runteldat,The movie didn't work no matter what DVD player I tried it in. I feel like I was robbed by the seller whom I am sure knew it didn't work.
1,Don't waste your money on this,"If you find bad jokes about the difference between black people and white people funny, then you will love this video. If you love cussing - especially the ""F"" word - this DVD is for you. If black racists crack you up, then buy this DVD right away. If you are Louis Farrakhan, buy this.If you want actual funny black stand-up, buy Chris Rock instead. Martin Lawrence is just horrible."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I too feel fleeced by the promises made by this book. There amount of specific, useful information, if any, contained in this book totals perhaps _2_ pages. Don't be fooled like I was. Calling this book a repair manual, imho, is misrepresentation."
2,It miss many details,"I have Toyota 4Runner. I had some problems and I would like to understand them. I purchased the book to help me to understand the operation and cause of problemes. If some one needs some lists of disassembly and assembly steps without requiring explanation drawings maybe he would find this book helpful. However, I am not satisfied with the drawings. There is very little about transmission. There is no diagnostic codes for transmission. The book does not have good sistematic structure."
2,The Institute for Integrative Nutrition (IIN) needs to stick to nutrition - not fitness,"I bought this DVD last fall thinking I wanted to learn more about Integrative Nutrition so I wanted to see what they had to offer in terms of various products they are peddling. Honestly, there are much better fitness DVDs on the market to incorporate fitness into your daily life. Since everyone has differing unique needs may I suggest checking out the numerous fitness DVDs at the local library while thoroughly reading the reviews here on Amazon, see which one seems most suited, give the video a try for a week or two and then come back to Amazon and buy the one that's most appropriate for you.For additional fitness on the move, I highly recommend any of the TNT Lifeline bands includingLifeline USA TNT Special Triple Resistance Cable."
5,Simply The Best,"Rapture simply the best album of any genre released in the 80's.Every song on this CD is memorable, the best performance by the most stylish voice of the last century or this. If you don't already know and love Anita Baker, or if like me you wore your CD out completely, now is the time to buy this genuine work of art."
5,Anita Raptured Us,"Rature today remains the best album by Anita Baker. Songstress is soothing also, but Rapture takes you on a journey with no return!."
5,Classic that will stand the test of time,"To put it simply, ""Rapture"" is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time. It's hard to believe when listening to it that it's 15 years old. It remains as fresh today as the first time I listened to it in 1987, and I was only a junior in high school. This album is for anyone and is a must have in any serious music collection."
5,Anita brings us Joy with this Album,"What a voice.This was Anita's second Album,and what a Joy. ""You bring me Joy,"" is one of my favorite songs ever,next to Carly Simon's,""Were so Close."" I play this song everytime I'm on vacation,and looking at the Ocean. I hit the repeat button over and over again. Every song on this CD is great.""Sweet Love,"" the first single from the record was a huge hit for Anita,along with ""Caught up in the Rapture."" I have bought every CD Anita's recorded after this one,and never have I been dissapointed,but this one's the best She has given us. I hope Anita gets back in the recording studio,and we get another taste of that beutifull voice."
5,Essential R&B Masterpiece,"With only 8 tracks, ""Rapture"" might be easily overlooked. In reality, it's not to be missed, ranking among the top R&B albums of the 80's. Anita Baker might be one of the most underrated yet thoroughly emotive vocalists of our time. She is subtle and understated when she needs to be, truly powerful when necessary, and soulful throughout. Tracks like ""Sweet Love,"" ""Caught Up in the Rapture,"" and ""Same Ole Love"" remain popular on R&B radio over 20 years after the album's release."
2,The music on this cd is just ok,"After listening to Sunny Waters' CD ""This Is Me"" many times, I can tell you that there are no surprises on it. There's no song that stands out among the others as being anything special. Each one drones blandly into the next. It appears he is simply trying to imitate other performers like Gordon Lightfoot and John Denver, but Sunny falls far short. On the other hand, there are no ""dings"" in the music, either. If you're looking for insipid background music to listen to, this cd is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,I'm sorta in-between,"Well, I'm sorta in-between the previous two reviews. I've listened to the cd several times. I defanitely like the instruments. They sound great. The vocals... eh. No real feelings one way or the other.~Kristine"
3,Not all that bad,"I thought the cd was okay. I read all the other reviews, but I don't compare Sunny to John Denver. John and others are in a league all themselves. Sunny's got his own style, sort of."
3,"Music good, CD cover graphics good, lyrics ok","This is, overall, a good cd. The melody of each song seems to flow effortlessly into the next song with no hesitant stuttering of momentum. The themes are similarly related; nature, relationships, wildlife, etc all are intertwined within the songs themselves. The backup musicians are excellent. Their efforts and talent shine through brilliantly in this cd. I felt the cd cover graphics were very good as well. It was a good marriage of colors, location, style, and text font, which makes it pleasing to the eye. The style of music is similar to the soothing, almost symphonic, feel of a Will Thompson or Jamie Caron-Smith. The lyrics were ok, but I wasn't overly impresed with them. So all in all it's a good first cd."
4,very good cd,I had herd of sunny waters before but just resently bought his cd. Im not much of a music analizer but I have to say that it is very good! Sunny outdoes what others havent done before. He creats things in your mind that no one else sees. At leste that is what it did for me. It was difanitly worth my money. Im going to keep the cd.
2,A Bland Rehash of Denver's Style,"Oh, boy . . . another guy who thinks he's John Denver. The songs here are all bland and about as predictable as you would expect. All the ""ideals"" that are custom-made to sell folk records you will find obtruding as big as a butte at the Grand Canyon. It just sounds like a rehash of what others before have done better, all with a sickly sweet sound that would send a diabetic into a coma. The style is nice and folksy (but dull), and the sentiments are nice and sacharine, but it all seems engineered to sell records rather than to express genuine feelings and ideas. It's all a great effort -- at copycatting. But as the songs are not too unplesant, I give him two stars."
5,Almost without words,I am almost without words to express the blessing this book is to me. Rev. Newell takes you verse by verse through the book of Revelations citing scripture throughout the Bible to explain his understanding of Revelations. This book will bring you to a more fervent desire to see the lost come to know Jesus.The book I have was my Grandmothers but I have since bought several copies and given to friends and family.
3,Nice but small,"This is a well made product,but the compartments are small and shallow. They will fit a few pills, but not many."
5,SMOOTH SAILIN' ALL THE WAY,"A classic swingin' album recorded in 1987. For starters you have Marshall Royal, Eddie Barefield, Milt Hinton, Duffy Jackson and Jon Faddis included in this full big band date. The arrangers are Eddie Barefield, Phil Wilson, Wild Bill Davis, Carol Scherick, and Jacquet himself. Illinois sounds as exciting as ever, and 2 of these arrangements are heard in the documentary video called ""Texas Tenor"". (another must for any Jacquet fan!)"
5,I can breathe again!,"I quit using hairspray several years ago because I couldn't breathe after spraying my hair. Given a choice I would rather have out of control hair and healthy lungs as to use the toxic brands. Then I found this at my fav healthfoold store and tried it. It's great, makes my hair shiny, has great control, brushes out easily and I can still breathe. There are several safe hairsprays on the market but they all made my fine textured, limp hair look greasy and stuck to my head. My husband loves it as much as I do and was really pleased when I found it on Amazon for quite a bit less money than the retail store. Thanks Aubrey and Amazon for giving me back my all day hair do."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this hairspray,"I was pretty happy with the regular hold of this hairspray but wanted to try the super hold to see if it was better and it is. I have not had the dusty experience others have and I find that it really holds the style throughout the day just as well as the synthetic stuff, even through a workout. I am really happy with it. Go Aubrey!"
3,"Works, but....","This stuff holds the hair just fine, but I can't get past the smell...it's just awful! I have considered buying some essential oil of one smell or another and adding it to the hair spray just to make it smell better. I don't know if this would make it lose its' holding properties, but as it is now I don't use it, so if it failed after that addition, oh well."
2,(+) Organic (-) It clumps,"Its organic and that's the only best part. However it doesn't spray evenly and clumps (white small patches) worse than other chemical sprays, which shouts out to the world that your hair has been cemented with a spray, which is a deal breaker. Even if its organic, if the finish is not clean, there's no point in using this. I will continue to search for something that provides clean finish and organic.Update: Guess my search for a better one is over. This one is amazing Flex Hold Sculpting Spray with Argan Oil DermOrganic 8 oz Hair Spray For Unisex"
5,"Smells great, works well","To be fair, I'm not a hairspray connoisseur, but this stuff works, which is important, and it smells lovely, which is a real bonus. I bought it to keep my rag curls curly throughout the day, they stayed for two!"
2,Hard to wash out,"I bought this spray because I am sensitive to chemical, but need spray for dance performance. First, this works great for a firm hold, doesn't smell bad, and dries quickly. I like it for what it does. However, I have used it twice now, and each time I have had a headache the next day. I am extremely sensative, so most people would be OK. Also, I agree with another commenter that this product takes two days to wash out, and with all the washing my hair feels stripped. I am looking for another product."
2,Makes My Hair Clammy & Dry,"This hair spray does not spray - it squirts, leaving hair clammy and dry. It may be a natural product but it damages my hair the same way other chemical sprays do. Will not buy again."
1,"Poorly researched, more assertions than facts","This book exemplifies the poorly researched conspiracy theorists it pretends to spoof. Written with a left-wing bias (""it's all the fault of those right-wing fascists""), the book makes a number of assertions without any indication of serious research. As an example, the author blithely associates Edison/General Electric with alternating current and Telsa/Westinghouse with direct current when quite the reverse is true. Within the same chapter, the author fails geography when he states Philadelphia and Norfolk are only 15 miles apart. (Those cities are about 210 miles apart when last I checked a map.) Indeed, the author is innocent of map-checking or other fact verification. I have to ask ""Were the editors asleep when they published this book?""In good conscience, I can't recommend this book to serious observers of the strange."
1,The Better Books Are Out There,"Overlook David Alexander's smug commentary on the various conspiracy/cover-up theories he presents, and you'll find nothing original. Just a roster of what the average conspiracy & cover-up reader has already read or seen on cable TV."
5,Highly recommended,"I wish I had this book 25 years ago when I first got in the business. Instead, I got it for my daughter when she joined my company. She picked up the concepts and jargon within a week! I now keep this book in the office and it is required reading for all new loan officers."
5,This CD saved me hundreds of dollars in lessons!,"I own most (if not all) of the Tom Veneziano TennisWarrior System of CDs and Books and the CD ""Training For Pressure Play"" is one of the best so far. I have listened to this CD many times and each time I listen, I learn something new. It's like having dozens of lessons for the price of one CD. I used a couple of the tips in one of my first matches after listening to the CD and I was shocked at just how well I played when I ""got out of my own way, relaxed and let the game happen.""I have taken a lot of lessons over the years, but nothing I have run across has helped my game as much as the information on the TennisWarrior website, books, tips and CDs. This system has saved me hundreds of dollars in lessons and improved my game at the same time."
4,authentic south-side Chicago; great old-time vocabulary,"I liked Gertrude of Stony Island Avenue very much. It is my first exposure to Purdy.Stony Island Avenue is the western boundary of the University of Chicago, my alma mater. This book catches the flavor of the area authentically, especially the style of the narrator, Carrie with her perfect-pitch dialogue and antique vocabulary. The time and place are beautifully evoked.The characters are all unreal but the mosaic is effective."
4,Wonderfully Victorian,"I have no idea why I loved this book, but I did. Maybe because the language, though stiff and formal, is beautiful, like a preserved rose. There's also something wonderfully pre-Freudian about the characters. True, just about everyone in the book is half cracked, but in this universe, they're allowed to be. What a delight to be reminded that there was a time, before Oprah's tele-shrink ministry, and mass prozac-taking, and the proliferation of bad shrinks, when eccentrics were tolerated. Now, they're cured. Purdy's novel is eccentric to beat the band, but great fun."
1,Let's hope the review gets printed this time!,"(...) Suffice it to say that this is one of the worst books that i have ever read (and i am an avid reader). It is completly unrealistic, which would be alright because fantasy is a respected genre. But nothing interesting happens. So let's consider it as a novel then. Does it have interesting characters that one can empathize with? No-they're all hysterical, repugnant, self-absorbed, emotionally stunted, selfish, and neurotic (and I don't mean that in a good way). This book is supposed to be ""moving"", sort of a tale of rebirth and redemption. But I disliked the characters so much that I actually wanted something awful to happen to most of them. And I am NOT a malevolent person. Do you see how much I hated this book? Enough time wasted on this dreck. (...)"
4,Written for People with Imagination!,"This was a great novel for Grisham. Have you lived on a farm in the South in the 50's? 7 year olds are mature there -- they see more life and death and work harder than most of us reading this book! Farm life, paticularly before mass television and ""entertainment"" was only routine and boring if you weren't a farmer -- or to us urbanites who are over-entertained by the world around us. The supposed lack of ending is only there to people who do not enjoy using their imagination. Think of all the possiblities that could go on -- think of writing a novel that begins where this one ends from the perspective of Cowboy or the other Mexicans that come to work each summer. Grisham gets our appetities wet to know more -- isn't that what good authors do?"
3,A Good Read,"Because I love the legal thrillers, I was reluctant to try ""A Painted House"" but then a friend loaned it to me and I was hooked. Its a good story and found that I was pulled into Luke's world and was always left wondering what would happen next. A different genre for Grisham, but one that is well written and a good read."
2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations for this book because I had heard of the author's reputation. The first half of the book is very interesting because there're mysteries about certain quirky characters. In the second half, things began to get predictable--and they turned out the way I thought they would. The plot is something you might see on LifeTime or Hallmark, which others might very well like. Grisham's writing is very succint, and the dialogue is easy to grasp. The direction of plot isn't unique.I was also puzzled by the behavior of the boy with the withered arm at the end of the book. Grisham doesn't give us a clear explanation, so I went back into the text because I thought I had missed something important. Well, I'm still puzzled. I think if Grisham had resolved this issue, then I would've liked this book more."
3,this book is lucky to get 3 stars!!,"this book is SO BORING!!!! With the exception of a couple of murders and maybe one or two other things, it made me fall asleep. All they do is pick cotton and talk about baseball. It's about a boy who lives in Arkansas and witnesses a couple of murders. and then he tells his family he saw the murders and that's about it. They could have left out half of the book and had the same story. Save yourself some trouble and don't pick this book up."
2,Boring and dull!,"I started reading this book in March on a plane ride to Italy. Read about 2/3 of it and finally finished the last 1/3 in November on plane ride to Vegas. Eight months later I didn't have a problem remembering what was going on in the book because nothing was going on!! Basically it was just boring. How many times can they pick cotton, listen to the St Louis Cards on the radio, eat butter beans, buy paint, go into town? I also thought some of the plots were a little far fetched. A seven year old boy witnesses two murders in one summer. How often do seven year olds witness even one murder, let alone two? If I didn't take that trip to Vegas and needed a quick book to read it would have remained unfinished."
5,A wonderful book,"I have read every book written by John Grisham, but this one is definately my favorite! This story is so descriptive, you feel as if you lived through the experiences. The narration is a little too in-depth and mature to be coming from a 7 year-old boy, but even that is forgivable. I have seen the movie adaptation of this story with Scott Glenn, and I was pleasantly surprized by how well they remained true to the book. I highly recommend this book."
1,this book...,"i love J.G. and i've read most of his books..but this one, it was sooo bad. I hated the cotton picking... i hated the little boy, and what i hated the most was the lack of and ending..i dont know how i finished reading this book. i just tought it was gonna get better, but it didn't. i could not believe how bad it was."
1,Very very weak effort by Grisham,"Even for a die-hard Grisham fan, this book was very very lame. The writing style is definitely Grisham, which is a good thing, and the fact there are not any lawyers in the story is not necessarily a bad thing.But the plot itself is incredibly weak, to the point of being almost non-existant. The character development is shallow and predictable. The ""suspense"" of who is painting the house is a joke.I couldn't believe how slowly things developed, until I realized that he had developed them as far as he was going to - and that was it. End of book. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book new. It's a waste of money. If you absolutely must read it, pick up a copy at a garage sale or a used book store. And don't say I didn't warn you."
1,"If you like Grisham's other books, you'll hate this one","Having wasted numerous hours with ""A Painted House"", I figured I'd better warn others of doing the same. While I've enjoyed almost everything else by Grisham so far, ""A Painted House"" was a huge disappointment. It's not just the lack of suspense (in fact, this book's most thrilling aspect is the summary on the cover). It's a total lack of a plot, a message or anything else that would justify 400+ pages. If that particular style of story-telling aims at getting the boredom of life in rural America across, THEN Grisham has certainly succeeded."
2,Somewhat Disappointed in Grisham,"Finally, after 50 some pages Grisham grabbed me with ""A Painted House"". But I am somewhat disappointed because my expectations were for the usual Grisham which is fast paced and an ""I-can't-put-this-down"" book. After I admitted to the honesty of Grisham's new style & new characters I began to delight in this book. But if you're looking for the usual kicks, try a differentGrisham book. I really hope this author's style hasn't mellowed out. I turn to his books for a thrill ride."
4,Very entertaining!!,"I really liked this book. It was refreshing to read something of Grishams that wasn't in the courtroom. My only complaint is that the book seems to end abruptly. It left me wanting more. I would love to read a sequel to find out what happens ""up north"" and to see what happens to the Latchers, Ricky, Tally and Cowboy."
5,WOW! excellent book,"I can honestly say that I couldn't put this book down. Believe it or not this was my first Grisham book ever so I do not know how it compares.I was amazed at the detail of the story and not knowing Grisham's age and background, could only assume he spent a lot of time doing research. I really got a different insight into how important Harey Carey is/was to baseball fans and how lucky we have it today. Unlike ""The Grapes of Wrath"" which a person could draw some comparisons of the literary style, this book was lite and you couldn't help but be drawn into this character. this seven year old character.This book also tells a wild story of a desperate time. It's a story of good and bad people in a time of innocence for a little boy."
3,"Good, but not great","In this novel seven year old Luke chandler is a farm boy in 1952. This book at times lacks excitment. With nat many plot twists or suspense this book could have used more. Although some parts were exciting most wasn't. This book however had memorable charechters. You want to know everything about them and everything that happens to them afterword. The only problem is seven year old Luke Chandler sounds more like a Fifteen year old. The worry his family has for there ninteen yaer old relative fighting in Korea it makes you feel like you are right there with the chandlers in there heartbreak and suffering. This story may not be the best, but the charechters sure were. The style of writing was also well done the plot just needed some retuning. All in all Grisham returns with his same writing talent just not the same story line and plot twist tallent. The ending however was unexpected and one of Grishams good endings."
4,A Painted House,"A Painted House by John Grisham was a very inspiring but diverse book. It reminded us of the past and how it effected our lives. Although this time was filled with moral values, there was still scandal found underneath. The book made us remember that we all have those childhood dreams of being something exceptional when we grow to adulthood. We recommend this book as inspiration and it keeps you wondering what will happen next. We give this book a thumbs up!"
3,Not your typical Grisham novel.,"Eh. That's the best I can describe my feelings when I finished this book. Eh. There were some parts that kept me interested, but generally the book wasn't all that engrossing. I've read all of Grisham's novels, and I really love his books.It's supposed to be about a young boy, Luke, who goes from innocence from maturity. I'm not sure I followed this plotline either. Seemed to be that the kid was still a kid when the book was over.Eh."
2,A Little Dull for Me,I hate reading half of a book and then not being able to finish it so this time I kept reading it until the very end hoping that maybe something would happen and make the book interesting...but it didnt. I think that maybe John Grisham should go back to the layers and the courtroom.
3,Different then I thought.,"This book is a very good book, but its not what I thought. I wanted a book like the rest of his books. Exciting and maily about trails and law and stuff like that. This is nothing like that. SO if thats what you are looking for do not buy this book. But if you just want a good book go for it."
4,Get yourself in the mood to YAWN,"Nothing happens. Still, an interesting picture painted of the south, and why you're happy you don't live there."
3,It better not be a movie!,"When I first started this book, I had to make myself read a chapter before I could go to bed. It does get better, if you make yourself continue to read. Although John Grisham's effort is touching (based on his life), he needs to stick with his usual arena. I would not recommend."
1,"Save your money - But if you must, buy it used","Remember in school trying to turn a two sentence topic into 500 words? Mr. Grisham did effectively the same thing - stretched five pages into 388. Whereas his previous works were exciting, this book tossed in one murder (which easily could have been omitted since the author didn't go anywhere with it) and a pregnancy which didn't contribute much to the storyline. First Grisham book where I actually went to bed with one chapter to go."
1,House Painted,"Loyal fan of John Grisham....I bought ""House Painted"" and what a disappointment! What was the point to the story? The same scenerio repeated itself throughout the entire book. Was this book supposed to be a test, something different from the ""lawyer/crimal"" books Grisham usually writes?"
4,Part Two.....PLEASE!!!,"I loved 'A Painted House'. It kept me laughing, crying, stealing time to find out what was going to happen next. John Grisham has such a sharp sense of humor. The only complaint I have is that it ended too abrubtly. I think there should have been a homecoming. Maybe at 'Christmas'? Just hoping, wondering. I need to know how Luke is!"
3,Not what I expected,"A refreshing change from lawyers, courtrooms, murder, etc. However, the ending left me with many questions - did Ricky come home from the war, what happened to Tally and Cowboy, did Luke fulfill his dream to play for the Cardinals? Hope there will be a second book and answer some of these questions. Enjoyed the narrative through the eyes of 7 year old Luke."
1,A Painted House,"Boring. Should have been a short story. It offered very little, gave very little and ended with very little."
1,"His next book should be ""Guilty of Bordom""","This book has entered my list of all time cures for insomnia, along with ""Cold Mountain"" and ""Angela's Ashes"". It can be summed up in one word - depressing. Books like this can be called 'page turners' because you keep turning the page to the expectation that something interesting has to happen.It is not believable. I might have believed it more if Luke were 14 and not 7. (I can't remember ever knowing a seven year old with the interest in naked women of an 18 year old.)And I don't think I could spoil the end because there is none. It is like Grisham just decides he is bored with the book himself and stops writing. It leaves a lot of loose ends. And there are so many loose ends that I fear he may be considering a second in the series, or God forbid, a trilogy."
2,Need some ZZZZZZZZZZ's,"I just finished reading John Grisham's latest book. Personally I really didn't care for this story. It was mundane, slow and dull. Definitely not one of his greatest works. I don't think I would recommend this book. A great book to put you to sleep."
3,Refreshing Arkansas tale,"This is the story of sharecroppers and their world. It was very enchanting to have the narrating voice in the story be that of a child. As such, there are many trials and tribulations that arise throughout his baseball-intensive world. My favorite scenes occur when the carnival comes to town. The antagonist in the story manages to beat out the heavy-weight champion in a duel. Also, I like it that the community spirit prevails throughout this story."
4,Good read,"Very different to the usual Grisham lawyer style books, but really good and captivating book! Highly recommended, at least by me!"
2,Hard to get into,I started this book twice now and can't seem to get into it. I imagine I'll try it again some day.
3,A Painted House,I thought the ending was too abrupt. I wanted to know more about what happened to the characters in the story.
4,A fine departure for Grisham,"I read Grisham for entertainment and not profound life's lessons. So The Painted House surprised me. It was a relatively slow book, but it's vividly and lushly written. The prose was very smooth. The dialogue, characters, settings, and storytelling place me right there right then. It is a pretty simple story, devoid of Grisham's normally frantic twists, but you just can't help but feel for these realistic characters. The ending is a little of a letdown, especially after an emotional journey. But I recommend this book."
3,Read this before you enter in your credit card #,"John Grisham gets off track with this seller. His usual legal thrillers are put to the side while this book is in the spotlight. The scene is a rural Arkansas cotton field in the 1950's. Our narrator is a young boy Luke, seven years of age. He 'loses his innocence' in this book as he witnesses murder, child birth, and arguements. This tale will catch your eye in the beginning, but beware- the middle is a sleeper. Towards the end you just want to read it to get it over with. But, if you like stories about the past, this is a book for you."
4,Real life story,"This is a real to life story. Once you start reading this book you don't want to put it down. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, and still wanted more. Great book"
4,Evokes My Own Childhood,"I was born in Tuckerman, Arkansas (near Jonesboro) in 1954, and although I've lived most of my life in St. Louis, I still feel a deep connection to the South. Although I recognize that A Painted House is not a classic along the lines of To Kill a Mockingbird, I still took great pleasure in reading it, simply because it evoked memories of my own childhood. Like Luke Chandler, I picked cotton, played with Mexican migrant workers, rode in the back of pick-up trucks, tiptoed my way around barns and chicken coops to avoid the occasional snake, and listened to Cardinal baseball games on a transistor radio on my grandfather's front porch. Those days are over now, and my extended family is spread across the country working for corporate America. My grandparents are gone now. Reading this book was like a visit back home. It brought tears to my eyes, and I'm sure I'll read it again and again."
3,Bit Disappointing,"I love John Grisham novels and found myself pushing to read this one, where in the past I am unable to put the book down. I thought the fact that it is written through the eyes of a 7 year old a bit far fetched, more like an early to mid teen eye's. Maybe the fact I am not American influenced me. I also found this book rather violent compared to others I have read, which were utter suspense in and out of a court room. Good to see John stretching his imagination in other ways though...but basically .... a bit disappointing."
4,a very rewarding read,I was very surprised to learn John Grisham wrote anything other than lawyer books. At first I almost gave up reading this somewhat slow moving novel because of the pace and the subject matter. Then after I read further I became caught up by the book which is a somewhat sweet and simple coming of age story of a young boy growing up in 1950's rural Arkansas. The book is both plot and character driven. Grisham's well detailed descriptions of the various characters make them almost unforgetable and combined with a few plot surprises results in a very rewarding reading experience.
3,A nice departure from the Legal set,"Although I'm no great fan of Grisham's, I read a review of this book which heightened my curiosity and enticed me to give it a try. The book has a slow build that eventually pulls you in and keeps you interested. Unlike his legal thrillers, this book does a pretty good job at characterization. You really get to know Luke, the narrator--his hopes and fears. At times it's hard to believe that the story is told from a 7 year-old's perspective. All in all, this is a solid read."
4,What happened to Tallie?,"I had the audio, which was well presented. I enjoyed the story with the rich description of life in that era. I had a little trouble believing a seven year old could be as mature as described. (Minor plot issue.) My only regret is the lives left dangling, especially Tallie's. Sequel?"
3,Finally no lawyers,I finished this book in less than a week. I was nice to see a story about something other than lawyers. It gave me a good insight into what its like living in the deep south and farming cotton.
1,"AWFUL, terrible, how could anyone like this book?","I don't get it, John Grisham puts his name to something and everyone says it is good....This book was nothing. Nothing happenned, I waited 450 pages for something, I am still waiting. I can't remember feeling more empty after finishing a book that I do now.....The only good thing is that I finished this in a few days on the train.....I read everything by Grisham and usually like most things, although, he has not come close to his first 3 novels....This one was NOTHING................don't waste your time.....I look forward to any feedback from people who liked this...."
1,Did Grisham Really Write This?,"Having read most of Grisham's books, I find it hard to believe he wrote this one. I wanted to quit reading it after a few pages, but I plodded through the entire book from beginning to end and it never got any better. I would not criticize a book unless I read it all to see if it had redeeming qualities - I found none. This book depicts a miserable summer in the poor cotton belt as seen through the eyes of a seven year old boy fixated on the Cardinals. It may appeal to some readers, but I find it hard to visualize it appealing to regular Grisham readers."
1,Not Grisham Quality,"John Grisham has strayed from the subject matter he has previously mastered - lawyers. Instead of a compelling story that draws one to the next page, I was forced to endure a rather long boring story line. Very disappointing from one of the most talented authors of modern times. Here's hoping that this was only a one-time venture."
2,Not John Grisham Style,"If this is the first John Grisham book you have ever read, please do not judge him off of this. He is brillant in all of his books pertaining to law. This book is written well....don't get me wrong, but the story is just too boring. I couldn't finish it.I do recommend John's other books.......this one must have been an experiment for him."
5,Beautiful and funny story,What a great writer John Grisham is. This is a beautiful story about a 7 year old boy living in the 50s and experiencing one harvest season with dramatic hill people and lots of comedy.I really enjoy this book and John is able to take you to a place where you understand the characters and situations.I absolutely recommend this novel to anyone that likes to read novels! YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!
3,A nice change of pace from the courtroom stuff but...,"I enjoyed the change of pace from Grisham's normal books, but like a lot of other reviewers, I didn't think it was believable that Luke was a 7-year-old, and that it ended sort of abruptly with seemingly no resolution of anything. The story seemed to be building up to a climax that never happened. While I did enjoy reading about life in rural Arkansas in the '50s, I just felt so let down at the end. I also thought that Tally, the teenage daughter of the Spruills, got a little too much enjoyment out of little Luke watching her bathe. Comments such as ""You liked that didn't you?"" and ""Maybe I'll let you watch me again."" seemed a bit disturbing for a 17-year-old girl to be saying to a 7-year-old boy."
5,A Painted House,"This book is very well written. It shows that Grisham has more talent than just your typical writer who would stick with only one topic. However, Grisham was able to expand his horizons successfully. I would highly recommend this book the suspense is evident, as is many other parts that are classic in a Grisham book. Whats missing though is the courtroom, however this was replaced by a barnyard. The book does reflect on the poor people and still holds true to this date because many farmers are just scraping by and holding down other jobs while they farm. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages."
4,"Warm, charming, interesting","Not a Grisham novel as we've enjoyed in the past; totally different and utterly enjoyable. Mr. Grisham takes us to a far away place in this story, rural Arkansas in the 50's. The characterization of young Luke was so genuine, so honest -- I felt I was within the lump in that young man's throat most of the time. I too have read and loved a great many of Mr. Grisham's books, esp. The Testament. A Painted House is truly is a different genre for him and I hope he continues to write wherever his heart leads him and that his fans will give him the room to do so."
4,Grisham Shows What's He's Got,"An excellent story but the main charachter, a young boy, acts in a way of a teenager."
3,A Painted House,"I started reading a painted house this Christmas vacation. I guess it must have been hard to concentrate on this book amid all the excitment! But I did like the book, its kinda slow at first...after you get past that it gets more exciting! I liked how the book gave all the characters a very definable personality and it drew a very clear mental picture of each person!I wish the book had started out more exciting so that I could have been more excited to finish! But the book does have a plot and it does become more exciting as your read...haha just don't give up at the beginning!"
4,A Painted House,This book was very good and made you want to read it. The ending definately came too soon...
2,"too depressing, not realistic","I have read most of John Grisham's earlier books, and enjoyed them, so I thought I would try this one. To me, it was not quite as good as his others. I thought this book was depressing. And it seemed a big stretch for a 7 year old to be as observant and clever as Luke was. The things that he witnessed and had to hold in were pretty strong for a young boy. It seemed to me that he would certainly have been traumatized, and would have told his mother, or grandfather. So it was not very realistic to me. That was the problem. Luke was too young. It should have been written in the first person by someone a little bit older, maybe 11 or 12. Then I would have enjoyed it more. Hard things happened in the book. I'm sure things like that really did happen, but for them all to happen here and for this boy to see them all, it was too much of a stretch for me. But I like John Grisham's other books a lot."
5,Great Purchase,"The book I ordered was exactly as represented and came very, very quickly. I rate this an A+ purchase! Thanks."
5,Another great one by JG,The Painted House is a must read for all John Grisham fans in particular and voracious readers in general. The story not only tells us about life in rural Arkansas (way back in the days) but also takes us into the various characters who might not be the same inside as what they would like the world to view them.Oh! and by the way did I mention that there are no lawyers in this book?
3,A Painted House,"I found this book compelling and unpredictable! It begins a little slow for my taste, but definitly picks up about half way through the book. I fell in love with the characters and the way John Grisham brought such drama and intensity to what would seem to be such a normal,predictable book. Unlike most of his other novels where Grisham uses lawyers and intense trials to keep the novel thrilling and exciting, he used a simple American family and a confused 7 year old boy to get that same heroic, adventerous feel. I was thouroughly impressed and engaged throughout the entire novel."
4,UNEXPECTED GRISHAM,"WHAT A SURPRISING CHANGE FROM THE MATERIAL HE GENERALLY WRITES. IT IS WELL WRITTEN AND I THINK ACCURATE, IT IS NO DOUBT CONDENSED, BUT I WAS AMAZED AT HOW BACKWARD THE SOUTH WAS IN 1953 UNTIL I MOVED HERE IN 1970, IT SOME RESPECTS IT IS STILL 30 OR MORE YEARS BEHIND THE TIMES. WHAT HAPPENDED TO THE PARADISE THAT LIFTS ALL BOATS."
4,No his usual--better than expected,"I enjoyed this book--even my husband liked it and he rarely reads anything. It was easy to read but the characters were interesting enough to keep your attention. ""Painted House"" is nothing like ""The Firm"" or any of Grisham's other books. It's more down-to-earth and tells the struggle of a family in Arkansas to just make ends meet--sort of a smaller ""Grapes of Wrath"" but without all the traveling. Also try Grisham's ""Last Juror"" or ""The Bark of the Dogwood"" by J.T. McCrae. All three of these are excellent reads."
2,Another disappointment from a good writer,"This book is another disappointment by a very talented author. The idea, it seems is taken from Homer Hickam's novel 'October Sky or The Coalwood Way.' Fortunately I did not spend any money on this book as well, but read it in hope that this might be interesting. The whole book evolves around one or two plots and does not get anywhere. The reader hopes that soon it will become interesting but, it does not. Mr. Grisham is cashing in on his old credibility. I would not recommend this book to anyone.Arshad Altaf Karachi, Pakistan"
2,What happened?,"At first, I was happy to here John Grisham trying his hand at something besides legal matters. But after reading this book, all I can say is I hope John gets back to what he knows best! I think John really missed a good chance to have a great book. It could have been great. I get the feeling he got in a hurry and ended the story without all the subplots coming to some great climax.I am sorry, but the story kept developing and developing, then nothing happened. All the different plots and story lines just drifted off into the wild blue yonder! After getting to the end, one is left with the question,,,,what happened???????I feel this is one book that would make a good move. As a book, I was very disappointed. Although, it was not as bad as the last book, ""The Brethren""!!!!!!"
2,Long and boring. . . . .,"I was very disappointed in this book by John Grisham. I found it long, boring and tedious. Perhaps, there have been just too many books written about poor people in the South in recent years. I found it difficult to identify with the characters. Some of the main characters were downright unlikeable. I am a teacher, and know seven year olds very well. The seven year old who narrates the story is extremely unrealistic. Seven year olds do not think like this child, nor do they have the vocabulary that this youngster has. I always keep books I enjoy and feel are valuable. This one was given away the very day I finished it!"
2,I give Mr. Grisham credit for working outside of the box,"I admire his bravery in stepping outside his familiar model of legal chicanery and redemption, but this work bored me stiff. I like his writing technique - short and pithy sentences - but this works better when there's a lot of action; it doesn't work as well in a ""bucolic"" as this book has been described. Also, the plot had too many loose ends. I was never sure if I was reading a child's perspective or that of an omniscient narrator. I will always buy another John Grisham book, but this one has already been passed on..."
2,Boring,I am an avid reader that reads 2 or 3 books a week. Not so with this one - it was soooooo slow and dull.
2,A Painted House,The only reason that this book may sell is the author's name. It is far removed from his previous novels and would only be worth reading if you are interested in growing cotton in Arkansas.
2,Not the work of a professional,"If this book had been written by an unknown author, it would be lounging idly at the foot of the non-sellers list. Only the name Grisham has saved it from a fate worse than death.John Grisham started sliding after 'The Firm' and A Painted House does nothing to slow his descent. I understand his need to get away from the lawyer genre, but a slow action, poor story book is not going to help. I struggled through to the end, hoping for a glimpse of former Grisham glory, but ended up feeling like I'd eaten a plate of stale air - hungry for something more substantial."
1,The painted hosue is Boring!,"Despite being an absolute Grisham fan, I found the painted house extremely boring! in fact, the only reason why I completed reading it was to see if something does happen at the end - unfortunately, it does'nt!! Grisham must stick to churning out nice thrilling books like the Testament and the street lawyer, rather than try his hand in this direction! Highly recommended Not to be read!"
1,Boring,I couldn't get through this one. It just couldn't hold my attention. It was great writing but the story just seemed to go nowhere.
1,As much fun as reading paint drying,"His worst novel, you keep reading waiting for it to get good (like his other novels), and NOTHING....Don't bother."
2,This was a drag...,"Mr. Grisham should stick to lawyer stories. I thought the story was slow. I felt horrible for the 7 year old male character telling the story. He witnessed a murder, a birthing, flooding and ruin, racial stress, naked chicks bathing and he still had time to buy paint with his cotton picking money! It is a quaint story but unbelievable. I am just glad I had the abridged version. I don't think I could have suffered through 13 hours of this."
1,"If you are a John Grisham's fan, this book is not for you","There are only handful events happening in rural area of Arkansa. They were repeated over and over again to makeup a story. Characters in the book developed very slowly and once they got developed, the story goes nowhere with them. If you are a John Grisham's fan, you might want to stay away from this book. I have doubt that he even wrote this book."
1,I can not think of a more boring book,"this book breaks with grisham's ""formula"" from his other books and, on top of that, it just stinks. a story about life on a farm in the 50s told through the eyes of a 7 year old.... when i realized that i had 9 pages left and no real story was going to develop i nearly burned the book. i read the last 9 pages and the burned it."
3,Not his best,"I have read all of John Grisham's books and have liked them all, but I really didn't care for this book. It was like watching a bad movie that I kept hoping would get better."
2,Great Build--No Climax,I'm becoming a little disgusted with John Grisham. This is another book that builds into a great potential story--and then has no climax. Hey John--how about tying up just a few of those loose ends? Where's the payoff?
1,whats cooking Grisham?...,"This novel has been such a let down, I have read all his books from start to finish always wishing it would never end,but this was one book I wished I didnt start!! If you are a big fan of John, you will terribly disappointed.I wouldnt recommend this book at all. complete lack of direction,no continous flow of the events. A murder here, A fight there,Rains, Cotton, Floods,painting,Mexicans,Hill People...Completely senseless..I was cursing myself why I picked up the book.Definitely A NO,I think it doesnt even deserve a rating"
3,It was a quiet kind of story,A Painted house was like watching a slow moving film. The story was interesting but told with patience and kindness. I enjoyed the book even with it slowness.
3,okay..,"it is an okay book to read, but i still cant understand how a 7 year old can be that grown up?"
4,Nice change for Grisham,"I really enjoyed this book, so much in fact, that I read the whole book in one sitting. I could not put it down."
2,A Waste of Time and Type,"I usually read a Grisam novel writhing a day. Ie, it's hard to put down. This one: I took a month to read this one. It put me to sleep several times. Why? Grisham had no substance to this novel. A pre-teen who lived on an Arkansas farm. Picket cotton with family. Employed Mexicanos, white trash (definition back then becasue they needed the work so they could lay around all year), and any other to help family pick cotton before the mechanical equipment. Had a sexual encounter with an OLDER female, birth of a baby by a white trash neighbor. A flood. Out of money went North to work at a job to come back and spend it on sharecropper land. What an original. Notice no top ten finish NOW. Grisham needs to realize that people PAY for a GOOD book not a family diary. Please JOHN write us a book...."
1,yawn - I just don't think I can go on anymore,I am a third of the way in and I keep asking myself if I can take anymore. This is almost as bad as The Chamber. How did this book make any bestseller list? Save your money unless you have difficulty sleeping at night.
1,Definitely a let down,"I had preordered this book, thinking it would be another one of JG's thrillers, sadly, it is more like reading a Romance Novel - one keeps thinking - Ah - now, there is going to be a court case or now a lawyer will enter the story - sadly - never happens !! Also, the book is more like leisurely reading and should be retitled ""Farm Life in the United States - A documentary"" .... good if you want to develop your knowledge about farm life in the US - but, if you have read any of JG's books earlier, then, shed all expectation while reading this one !! I think its his name that has sold more than the book itself !!"
5,Second only to A Time To Kill,"As an avid Grisham reader, I really enjoyed reading a book with full character development and a good storyline. Although I still feel A Time To Kill is the best book he has ever written, A Painted House comes in as a close second. I only hope that Grisham will write a sequel to this book and let us know what happens to the Chandler clan."
4,"4 1/2 Stars - Simple, Real and Refreshing","Grisham's writing style has always been simple, elegant and effective. But, his last few legal-oriented works fell a bit flat. This story is a refreshing change of pace. The characters are believable and the story of small town America is realistic. I had an instant connection with these people and enjoyed spending the entire a harvest season with the Chandlers, sharing in the ups, downs and ""secrets."" I was sad to see it end, and that is always an indicator of a good story in my book."
2,Unsatisfying..,"I absolutely LOVE John Grisham's legal thrillers, but I was excited to see that he had written something else. I bought it the second I saw it. It's one of those books where I had to keep starting over - I would get through a few pages, get bored and not pick it up again for weeks. Eventually, I forced myself to read it during my lunch break. I found it very predictable, no real depth to any of the characters, not thought provoking.. I just kept reading because it seemed like Grisham was building up to something, and I kept waiting for it. Then the book was over. I didn't have any attachment to any of the characters and in general I didn't really care what happened to them (this never happens to me!)But if you're a Grisham-lover like I am, you'll probably have to read it for yourself. My advice, borrow it from someone."
4,"All Grisham's talent, in a different genre.","I enjoyed Grisham's writing style from the viewpoint of a young boy. It was a surprisingly well-developed story, and I didn't want it to end."
4,Awesome Arkansas,This Grisham book was awesome. A seven year old name Luke is growning up on a cotton farm in rural Arkansas. I would reccomend this book to anyone. It was different than most Grisham books because it didn't have to deal with the law stuff. It is a good book and I would recommend it just like I said.
5,Very Good Read,"First off the other book is ""Skipping Chrismas""Second off this book is excellent for young and old readers alike for example: I'm 14 and i thought it was great, my dad is 44 and he also thought it was great. I dont like much other John Grisham, but this was a very good book. Its about a farm family whose son in a word is a dreamer. You'll love spending the summer with his family."
3,Nothing at all like 'The Firm',"When I got this book, the only thing I had on my mind was all of his other books that he had written...suspense, thrills, edge-of-your-seat kind of action. Not at all like that!!It started out really, really slow. Set back in the 1950's on a cotton farm in the back woods of Arkansas, the Chandler family is having a tough time getting workers to work the fields. The son, Luke Chandler, is a character that you can't help but to fall in love with.This was a change for me, but all-in-all, it was a pretty good book; just too slow!!!Latrica"
4,An excellent work,"I never really thought of myself as a Grisham fan, though I freely admit to reading every effort he has made. And although the usual excitement and suspense, so prominent in his earlier works, is completely absent in A Painted House, I would say it is his best work so far.The setting is Arkansas in 1952 on the Chandler family's small cotton farm. Told by the seven year old son, the story slowly and comfortably unfolds, drawing the reader into the lives of the family members. It sounds odd but, even though I've never even seen a cotton farm, I felt nostalgic as I read it. The people are simply sketched in very broad strokes, allowing readers to infuse some of their own memories into the characters. I recognized the honest farmer, the kindly shop-keeper, the long-suffering women and so many of the other characters it felt like I was back home in my youth.Grisham has written this with humour, sensitivity and respect. I knew he could write, but I never suspected he was an author."
3,"A little slow, but that's OK with me...","Obiviously this slow southern story about cotton farming told through the eyes of a 7 year old boy was a huge departure from the legal thrillers we have come to expect from John Grisham. As a first attempt at a new genre, I give it a thumbs up. Reading it certainly put one back into a slower simpler place and time. The descriptiveness of the scenery and day to day life in a small town farming community in the early 1950's seemed quite realistic to me. At times it was tedious to read, particulary the minute details of the 1952 baseball season, but on the whole it was rather pleasureable. Good work Mr. Grisham."
2,You probably should have put a lawyer in it,Could not finish. First book from his stable of book that could not allow to run to completion. I can not give it away. Good luck if this is all you have to read.
3,Could Have Been Better,The story moved too slowly for me. I kept wanting Luke to get older and move on to different things. I tired of reading about the cotton fields day after day and about the money problems. I wanted to see the author tie off loose ends of the different plots that developed in the story. The book left me hanging in too many areas.
4,"Best ""cotton picking"" book I've ever read...","The only disappointing part of the book is the last page. It leaves you wondering, ""What happened next?"" A Painted House is a story of one summer in the south that is timeless...as told by a little seven year old boy. There is plenty of humor and page-turning suspence. Excellent!"
2,John Grisham's DULLSVILLE,"I have read all of his books from A TIME TO KILL onward. This was by far the most disappointing. I couldn't get through it. The characters had no substance and the plot was dull. Very rarely do I not finish a book, however, this was one of the times."
4,A Cool Read,"This is not the type of book customary of John Grisham but I enjoyed it anyway and think it's worth the read.The book is set in rural Arkansas and centres around Luke Chandler and his family of share croppers. Luke's family hires help each year from Mexico and the 'Hill People' to cut their cotton so that they can pay their bills. It's their only income and they depend heavily on the labourers as the Chandler family is too small to manage it all.The characters in the book are quite entertaining seen through the eyes of the young boy Luke. Luke who sees and hears too much for his own good at 'cotton picking' time. And all that he sees and hears must remain a secret from his close knit family who are ever eager and full of interrogation.It was a sweet read and another book that will be with me for keeps.NutfaceDecember 3rd, 2001"
3,Not my favorite grisham book,"It was okay, certainly nothing I will read again. I kept waiting on it to pick-up about 1/2 through, but it never did!"
2,I want my 6 u$d dollars back,"Its genre undefined between suspense and ""customs and manners"", fails as both. Boring, boring, boring. Nothing happens. French ending. Avoid this one"
2,From the sublime to the mediocre,"Like most people I know, I read all of John Grisham's. This one is definitely a plunge from sublime to the ridiculous. From the first few chapters, I had this strange flasbacks of Tom Sawyer, Studs Lonigan and Once Upon A Time in America all slapped together into this dragging, incoherent, disjointed plot, without rhymes, reason or resolution. Some people call it style, I say Grisham should stick to his lawyerly knitting."
1,Not so great...,"...for a Grisham book. Maybe it was because it was his first foray into non legal thrillers, for this book has nothing to do with law nor is in the least bit thrilling. The character development is decent, and that is all that it turned out to be--the book just seemed long and drawn out. Nothing dazzling here. I say skip this one."
3,"sweet, but unremarkable","Having not read John Grisham before, I did not suffer any of the disappointment that some others who are avid fans of his books have expressed at his departure from his regular ""lawyer genre."" The book was a quick read and held my interest to the end, it is a sweet story told through the eyes of a very likable 7-year old boy named Luke. Unfortunately, the book falls short of real in-depth character development and is fairly predictable. It is a nice story that isn't terribly thought provoking. I wouldn't put it on my ""must read"" list, but it would be a fine diversion at your next doctor appointment."
3,Change of pace,"Having read a few of Mr. Grishams works , I gave this a shot. Decent story of Luke and family struggling to make it in farm country Arkansas. Likened it to ""Wish you Well"" and ""To kill a mockingbird"". Not the best I've read in awhile, but an entertaining piece of work. A little disappointed in the ending. I'd say, overall, if you prefer Grishams regular work, you should like this. A change of pace for his fans."
3,The Digression of Grisham,"This book is nothing expected from Grisham. No courtrooms, no affidavits, and no business suits. This book is a breath of fresh air. Grisham shows he has more talent than I gave him credit for. The book is literature in the true sense of the word."
2,Didn't really like it!,"I have read almost all of Grisham's other tales. I knew not to expect the typical lawyer tale, but I could not get into this book. For me it did not have the substance that I was seeking. I was frankly bored by the tale of the mountain-people coming to town to help the farmers. It just did not have mystery, suspense, romance or anything captivating to me.If you like this kind of story, I guess it is good for what it is, but it definately wasn't for me. If I had skipped ahead and read the last chapter, I probably would have quit the book less than half way through.Sorry, but I just didn't like the story!"
4,"Good Story, But The Ending Is Lacking","I enjoyed this book a great deal until I reached the ending. I did not feel that the author wrapped up a few of the story lines as he should. I was left wondering what happened to a few of the main characters.It would have been nice if the author had included some sort of epilogue as a way of letting the reader know what finally did become of the Chandler family, Ricky, and the Latcher family. Did Ricky ever make it home? Where did the Latcher's go after the flood ended? Did the Chandler's ever return back to the farm? All questions that I would have appreciated answers to.The author gives a few hints as to what could possibly happen, but I guess I just prefer things a bit more concrete. All in all though it's a good story that moves along at an excellent pace."
2,What a Disappointment,"I love to read John Grisham's books, but here is one author who should stick to what he is good at; the law. ""A Painted House"" was one of the most boring books I have ever read. Characters were shallow and there was absolutely no plot. I wanted more. I expected more. It could have been a good story line."
2,Expected More...,"Grisham leaves fan wanting more from the Painted House. Have way through the book, he lost me. The characters tend to just fall off without any follow-up. I was very disappointed."
2,Boring...,"As a Grisham fan, I was extremely disappointed with this book. I was worried about his deviation from the legal thriller when Skipping Christmas came out and was hesitant to read it. However, I was pleasantly surprised and when this book came out, I was a bit more eager though secretly wishing he would stick to his genre. After reading this book I am not even looking forward to reading The Summons (though I will). The character development was mediocre, the plot went nowhere, making you glad when the final page was in sight, though I wouldn't say it was an ending. Let's hope he can make a comeback, though I haven't been hearing the greatest about his new endeavor. Skip this one and possibly the next."
2,Dissappointed,"The story was beautfully told, but at times dragged on and on and on..... Can't believe I actually finished it. Frankly it was boring and left too many loose ends."
2,Not impressed,"I spent two days reading this book and wondering when it was going to get to the point. Basically a ""Farmers Almanac"" of rural Arkansas cotton country in the 50's through the eyes of a 7 year old. A lot of would-be plots that never seem to blossom into anything and then vanish into the endless dialog of Cardinal games and cotton picking. Sorry...this was a Grisham disappointment. I only finished the book because I thought somewhere it would eventually tie together and make some sense, but the ending was the most bland and disappointing part of the book. I always keep the books I read, but this one goes to the used book store as a donation."
3,GRISHAM SHOULD STICK TO LEGAL THRILLERS!,"I just finished reading this book and found many positive and negative aspects of it. On the negative side, Luke seems too mature for a 7 year old boy. 7 year old boys aren't interested in 17 year old girls. Second, there wasn't much suspense or an urge to stay up all night and read this book, the story was somewhat bland. However, I'm sure many people could appreciate this book and its story line. But if you are used to Grisham's legal thrillers and think this will someone be related to his other works, think again. There is nothing better to me than a great ending that makes you think to yourself ""Wow, who would have thought it would end like that?"" A Painted House lacks that. So I give it 3 stars for the good story line and great use of dialogue. Grisham is still my favorite author!"
2,This Can Not be Grisham,"If you are reading my review as a long time Grisham fan, I plan to give you insight to this book. First of all, I can tell you this book was only a hit because it had The name John Grishman on it. For all you fans out there, don't buy it. All you housewifes and grandma's this is your book. I've read every Grisham ever written, some of my favorites being The Pelican Breif, The Chamber, and A Time to Kill. Those are fast-paced books on Grishams topic; law. He has strayed so far from his genre of book, that we now see him writing about a little cotton pickin' boy that you'd almost think you'd see on a required reading list in middle school, next to the grapes of wrath. Sure-maye this is a good book, but not for the normal grisham fans. It looks like his next one 'skipping christmas' is along the same lines. I think I'm going to be missing my favorite author for awhile."
4,GOOD BOOK BUT...,"I really enjoyed this book. However, I think John Grisham should stick with what he does best - legal thrillers. ""The Painted House"" would be a great book for another writer, but just so-so for Grisham. I can't wait to read whatever he comes up with next."
1,I would rather paint a house......,"...than read this book again. As a Grisham fan, I was sorely disappointed by his latest effort. I fully expected a deviation from his ""traditional"" writing style, but this was too much. I kept waiting for something to happen, but in the end was left with unfulfilled expectations. The book is roughly 380 pages, but could have been shortened significantly - much of the dialogue is repeated. For example - the treks out to the cotton fields were descriptive but repeated often.If this was an ""unofficial autobiography"" of Grisham's childhood, I feel sorry for him. What a boring life. Why write about it?"
3,About half a book,Not what I expected. Skipped parts just to keep it moving. It was a long wait for some excitement that lasted only a few short paragraphs now and then. Good basic story just didn't keep the reader's interest and ended with too many unanswered questions.
3,Made for TV,"This book is told in the eyes of a seven year old, and you really have to keep that in mind when you write a review on this book. I felt that this was not one of Grisham's better novels. In a nutshell, it's about cotton picking on a farm. It's the average, every day lives of a bunch of people that surround a seven year old boy's life. The action moved extremely slow, and it seemed just when it picked up, it slowed to a snail's pace afterwards. It has a lot of good dialogue, and if you enjoy a slow moving story, then this one's for you. But I felt like I sat through almost four hundred pages of story, and then Grisham didn't even have a conclusion or an epilogue to let you know what happened to all these people. I sure hope there's no movie on this one--the only thing it's good for is a made for tv movie, and that's stretching things."
2,Not your typical Grisham,"It's a slow story with a not so good plot and shallow characters. So far I think John should stay in the courtrooms. As I read on, I kept waiting for a climax that never came. I was surprised at the end when I realized that after all I had sort of enjoyed the reading. It's not the typical Grisham but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have no other book to read."
3,Not Grisham's best.....,"I have read all of John Grisham's previous work and knew that her decided to foray from his regular genre. Truly, The Chamber and Street Lawyer were more moral tales than legal thrillers, but this newest book is not about lawyers at all.The story is interesting and I like the idea of a child narrator, but it doesn't flow evenly throughout the novel. Luke is supposed to be a 7 year old and comes across as alternately whiny and wise. The book does deal heavily with the inticacies of cotton farming, but there needs to be more of a true story line. It seems more a narrative of Luke's summer.At the end I felt that not all of the issues had been resolved and that it just faded away.It wasn't all that bad, Grisham obviously wants to prove that he is more than just Pulp Fiction, but this is not the next To Kill a Mockingbird."
2,What might have been,"I tried to like this book - really, I did. I just couldn't. Grisham tries to evoke the spirit of Scout from To Kill A Mockingbird and just fails miserably. Luke had the potential of being a wonderful creation, but never quite made it. The characters are poorly developed and the backstory is essentially nonexistent. Perhaps the failure lies in the sheer number of characters? The worst part is that I kept thinking that the book would get better and it didn't. I hate when that happens."
1,Watching paint dry,I have read all the John Grisham books available. I love them. I recommended them to all my friends until I read this one. This book is about as exciting as watching paint dry. I kept reading and reading waiting for the plot to pick up. It never did. In my opinion John Grisham needs to stick to the courtroom and lawyer storylines.
4,Simplicity at its best,Truly a breath a fresh air for Grishim. Takes you back to a place where most have never been before through the eyes of a 7 year old. An easy read for all to enjoy.
3,Unlike Grisham,"Unlike your other reviewers, I was disappointed in this book. It was more like Faulkner than Grisham. I dislike wading in poor people's misery, and the immigration problems. I hope he goes back to his court rooms and mysteries in his next novel."
4,This is a great book,"I have been a John Grisham for a few years now and was very enthusiastic when I saw his new book came out. I thought this book was very well written, kept me interested from page one. I loved the fact that this book was narrated from the viewpoint of a 7 year old. It was very refreshing getting a child's perspective. The only thing I was disappointed with was the ending. When I read the last page I immediately wanted to know how their lives would be now. That was my only disappointed. I highly recommend this book."
2,Not The Grisham I Know,"What a disappointment. After so many great thrillers and suspense novels from Mr. Grisham, ""House"" reads like Writing 101. Told first person by a seven year old, the novel covers a cotton pickin' season in Arkansas. Oh, and a house that needs painting. I missed the ""coming of age"" of young Luke Chandler that some reviewers rave about. Luke starts out as a seven year old, saw some nasty things, missed his brother Ricky, and dreamed of being a St. Louis Cardinal. We leave Luke after too many pages still seven years old, missing his brother and dreaming of being a Cardinal.After 250 pages I started skip reading then resorted to skipping pages. I don't think I missed anything. Maybe this was the ""artistic"" effort that some critics have wanted from the author. If so, you've got it out of your system, John, now please come back with the good stuff."
1,A PAINTED HOUSE,"WHERE DID GRISHAM GO? I was extremely disappointed with this latest book. Enough already with Saturday outings into town, and enough already with picking cotton. The characters were dull and the events boring.What happened to plots like the ""Pelican Brief"" or ""A Time To Kill""? I only bought this book because I collect first editions of Grisham's novels. I didn't want to break my collection.I wonder if Mr. Grisham has fallen asleep at the word processor. This book worked better than a sleeping pill at putting me to sleep. Hopefully the next one will keep me interested and awake."
1,As fun to read as watching a painted house dry,"Grisham should stick to his legal dramas. It started with a lot of promise. Sadly, the characters were underdeveloped to say the least. I never felt any kind of emotion for anyone in the book. If he had wrote a few more chapters that developed the characters it would have been a much better book."
1,DULL.....,"I hope that John Grisham returns to his regular genre with his next book. I always look forward to his new release in February as an escape from winter in Western New York, but this book was dull, slow and boring. I just kept reading to get to the end. I'm glad I borrowed this book from my public library and didn't waste my money on purchasing it!!"
2,Dissapointed...:(,"John Grisham gets such high accolades from many of my fellow readers, I just had to read one of his novels. Since ""A Painted House"" is historical fiction, my favorite genre, it was choice #1. Well fellow readers, I was so dissapointed. The book is so slow that it was like watching molasses drip from a jar. There were tidbits of sweetness, the only reason I continued on, but for the most part a slow, boring story. I will give Grisham another chance but not for a long time."
3,A different type of Grisham novel,"Not the usual type of Grisham novel, but interesting. I think he should have made this ""through the eyes of Luke, a seven year old"", but told by him as an adult. Not many seven year olds that I know would think quite like this. I would like to see a sequel just to find out Grisham's idea of what happened to these people."
5,Refreshing Change of Pace for Grisham,"A Painted House is a wonderful story of rural American life in the 1950's and is a refreshing change of pace for author John Grisham. The book puts on display Grisham's excellent storytelling abilities which are not inhibited by the tired legal thriller premise. I hope the book's success encourages the author to continue to seek ways to branch out from the legal genre. I found myself reminiscing to the time I was seven and spent Sunday's on my granparent's farm, dreaming of being a major league baseball player. No, the storylines did not wrap up neatly at the end, but that was obviously the intent. I wonder if the readers who have expressed dismay over the unresolved endings surrounding the most prominent story lines, caught the subtle lack of resolution of the book's titled theme."
4,Please Let There Be A Sequel,"Otherwise, the ending sucked. I liked this book. I enjoyed this book. I was there -- in Arkansas, and was listening to Stan Musial and the Cardinals on KMOX. Not really, but while reading this book, I felt like I was.It was neat for me because my mother grew up in that part of the country and has told me many stories about picking cotton and being poor.Please right part II Mr. Grisham."
4,A Painted House,"Loved the book, great characters, and the story unfolded well. However, did not care for the finish. Seemed like the entire book built the reader up for a much more detailed ending."
3,Painted House,It is a nice to have easy reading story. Not great but enjoyable nevertheless. This is a book that you can take your time to read and easy to remember.
4,A Painted House,"The book has a soul to it suggesting that it reflects at least some of Grisham's experiences as a child, even if the events themselves are not real.The book is from the view point of 7-year old Luke and for the mopst part it works. There were times, though, when the voice was that of an adult remembering an event with the clarity of maturity that would not have been articulated by a child. It was a little jarring when it happened.The experience of being a poor cotton farmer and the hierarchy of that society rang true in Grisham's descriptions. The richness of Luke's family life and support also rang true.I would highly recommend this book."
2,Excellent writer/boring book,"Grisham certainly has a mastery of language, however, ""A Painted House"" moves so slowly and the repetition is so grating it adds little to the story. Incessant yammering about the love of the St. Louis Cardinals, mom's garden, and Ricky's service in Korea propelled me skim the last third of the book. The seven year old protagonist sounded more like a twenty year old and had ideas far beyond those of any seven year old I have met. Grisham certainly captured the environment and hardships of farming life in the 50s; however, other than giving the reader a sense of a life that is not commonly part of most American's lives today this book is, quite simply,boring. The author opens many potentially interesting plot lines that all fizzle in the end. Nothing much develops from these plot lines; then again that may be Grisham's point and I am so obtuse I missed the ""big picture."""
1,"John, John, John... you can do better than this","I am an avid Grisham fan and as always couldn't wait to get my hands on A Painted House as soon as it was out. The whole while I was reading the book, I kept saying to my husband ""Look how far I've read and nothing has happened yet."" This was truly a disappointment. Hopefully this is not the direction Grisham will be taking in his future publications."
1,Not his best work,"Just finished A Painted House and seeing as I have read all of Grisham's books I can honestly say ""Not his best work"". This books drags to a point of bordeom, however you keep reading thinking it will get better since all of John's books do at some point. Not sure what he was trying to do with this story, but he failed."
2,A Painted House,"This book was a major disappointment. It was a struggle to finish it. I am a big Grisham fan. I have read and loved all of his books. I eagerly awaited this one. I do not read reviews of his books before purchasing them. I felt totally deceived by the author. I had no idea what the book was about and assumed I was going to enjoy another of his books,as usual. From now on I will surely read reviews. I want his ""old"" stuff, the lawyers, the thrillers, etc."
1,A Painted House,"This book has unfortunately become the standard for which to base all of Grishams latest novels by. You keep looking for something interesting to happen which will propel you into an exciting adventure and it never happens. I have all of Grishams novels and I would rank this above only the Street Lawyer, only because it was the worst (short) story I have ever read. I think John Grisham should take some time off from writing to see if he has any more great novels left in him instead of pushing out sub standard novels like his last few."
1,Give me the old Grisham back!,"I am not impressed. I have all of John Grisham's books, but this one will not be in my library. Give me the old Grisham back!The one star I give it is because of who wrote it, not beacause of the book's content."
4,Poignant,"Grisham does an excellent job of putting the reader in the time and place. This book accurately describes the daily struggles of farmers and their tennants.It's a different style of writing that's typical of Grisham - I've enjoyed every Grisham book and while this book is of a different style, it was a very enjoyable read."
4,"Same brush, new colors for writer John Grishim","""A Painted House,"" is an interesting story...very nicely plotted and subplotted and a nice change of pace for the author who is famous for writing legal tales of mystery and suspense.I appreciate him stretching out his new legs on this story about a young farm boy and one particulary tough summer.No law mentioned in here, which proves Grishim can write whatever he feels like writing about.Yeah, buy the paperback. It'll paint some pretty pictures in your head....if you saw it on TV already, that's okay.The book is much better .... really."
4,A tragedy and a comedy,"The story and the style of writing were very interesting, but the book contains the funniest story that I ever read -- about a first time northern visitor to Arkansas who had to use the bathroom/outhouse, and how the seven year old boy got revenge(?)."
4,i really enjoyed it,"it is strange how this book reminds me of TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD-that i admit was better -but grisham is quite good too. tolook a the world through the eyes of a seven year old is interesting--his guilt at keeping secrets from his parents, his interest in baseball and he dislike of picking cotton make him real---. i enjoyed the book--do read it-it is real nice to read about a child's sentiments rather thn the usual law and court stuff that grisham usually writes."
1,Slowest Read Ever,"Go to the library to get the book. Then your only costs will be your time to obtain the book, gas to get the book, time to read the book, cost to return the book, and time to wonder why you read the book (although there is no cost for gas for doing that). If someone gives you the book - write your 'thank you' before you read it, otherwise, you'll put off writing the 'thank you' because you'll be wondering why and how to say 'thank you.'"
3,The New Grisham,"After reading the back cover of the book, my first thought was, hmmm, do I really want to buy this book? But, it being a John Grisham novel, I did. While the story is very slow moving, I did find it interesting. It is interesting to hear the story told from the perspective of a little seven year old boy and his life on the cotton farm. It's a piece of life that not too many of us see or live. It certainly brings to light the harsh reality that comes with the decision to be a cotton farmer. The depicted life style brings a true sense of the struggles, the hardships, and the triumphs and tradegies involved with life on a cotton farm."
2,Grisham is not Faulkner,"Grisham left the familar law environment and ventured into the world of sharecroppers and white trash which Faulkner did so well. He should have stuck to his familar area. This book did not hold my attention as the others did. A Time to KIll remains his best book ,in my opinion."
4,Wonderful Coming Of Age Story,"I have always hoped that John Grisham would spread his wings and write different types of novels; stories that explored the South of his childhood. His early novels were written in a prose style that exceeded those of his later novels. In ""The Painted House"" he goes down a road that Faulkner, Willie Morris, Eudora Welty, and many other fine writers have traveled. His descripions of the long days spent picking cotton held my attention, not an easy feat. I found his depiction of the various families in the novel interesting and for me the payoff of the novel was rewarding. I highly recommend this novel."
4,Bringing Back Old Memories,"Although this novel varied from Grisham's usual writings, I enjoyed the story immensely. It tended to bring back old memories of cotton pickin' time in Alabama, where I was reared. However, some readers might not enjoy the recollections of the seven-year-old main character if they couldn't relate to what his life was like. I must add, also, that I do think the seven-year-old boy behaved and thought way beyond the years of any seven-year-old I have ever met."
3,my review,"I found this book to be very entertaining. Comparing to other Grisham's novels, this one does not deal at all with lawyers. It is definitely a refreshing change. However, we are regaled by the fine writing Grisham has always used. The characters are alive and the story keeps you wanting to read and once it is over, wanting to know what happens to all the characters."
3,Different,"This book was certainly a continuation of Grisham's departure from the prose that made him famous. I can't say I didn't like it, the simple portrayal of life did have a certain appeal to it. However, this isn't one of those books that you pick up and find yourself unable to sleep, wanting to stay up and find out what was on the next page. In fact, it took me about 4 days to work my way through this one--a record when it comes to my typical time with Grisham's books."
2,A painted house,"Honestly, I could not wait for this book to end. It was SOOOOOOO slow from start to finish. BORING is the only way to describe it. Would not recommend. I admire Mr. Grisham for trying to depart from the lawyer stuff but this just didn't work for me."
5,Check This Out,"A Painted House another on the edge of your seat book by John Grisham. It is about a Alabama boy from sometime in the 1940's or so. His family hires some hill people and they come and pick cotten. One of the hill people,Hank, is a very mischeviuos teenager thats gets the Chandles into trouble. There is a ton of events that keep you going and you will never want to quit reading this book."
4,A Painted House,"Grisham has created a work that parallels ""Grapes of Wrath"" in presenting the problems and depressing lives facing sharecroppers and rent farmers in the south during the middle part of the past century. He crafts the work from the viewpoint of a 7 year old boy whose ambition is to become a Cardinal baseball player and symbolically has the young boy to mature during the summer of 1952. As the story of the summer unfolds, young Luke is forced to make mature decisions about the 'secrets' that he knows. It is one Grisham's finest works if not his best."
3,A good effort.,"As with all of his books, I found the writing here very compelling. Grisham can really draw you into his stories. I thought he did a great job of developing the core characters; however, I don't think he developed the Spruills enough. Why were they motivated to do the things they did? How did these major events in their lives affect them? Also, Luke was not believable as a seven year old. Perhaps 10, but no younger than that. I take issue with the feeling that this was a total departure from his usual - a character caught in the middle of a scandal and the good guys run off into the sunset. But all in all a great effort for a first ""literary"" book."
4,"Not a lawyer in sight, but a too insightful child","The story tells the challenges of life for an Arkansas cotton farmer on the verge of poverty during the 1950's. Leaving the usual setting of courtrooms and lawyers, John Grisham takes us back to his childhood to spin a good yarn. The novel has a genuine quality about it that draws the reader into the story. The parade of events is seen and commented on by a young boy with insights of an adult, which distracts from the story. This is a good read and page turner."
1,A Surprise From An Icon,I have been a John Grisham fan from the get go. Never missed a book. I was quite willing to accept that his talents went beyond the legal. I was wrong!The book is a disaster! It is a total bore. Written quite all right but just nothing that grabs your attention.The first Grisham book that I could put down...the first Grisham book I will not finish.
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I'm a big Grisham fan, but I knew this wasn't going to be the typical legal thriller and was looking forward to the change. Unfortunately, Grisham should just stick to his formula. A Painted House was boring, predictable, and unrealistic. Luke, the 7-year-old narrator, sounds too much like Grisham and not enough like a 7-year-old boy. I believe this is supposed to be a touching coming-of-age story, but that theme has been done much more justice in many other books, namely Catcher In The Rye. Grisham had a formula that worked, he should stick to it."
3,Another Grisham weak ending?,"I just finished reading ""The Painted House"" and I enjoyed it as a wonderful visit to rural Arkansas during the 50's as seen through the eyes of a 7 year old boy (albeit somewhat wise beyond his years). It is an easy read and a page turner, not because of mystery or excitement but because it is a nice time and place to visit. Oh, but there is plenty of excitement in that little town.I am dissappointed by the ending. Once again Mr. Grisham leaves us hanging with so many unanswered questions. Does Ricky come home, for example. What about the flood? Does it get to the house? How can we just leave these people in that mess? I thought Mr. Grisham was getting better about tying things together at the end, maybe not."
1,... like watching a painted house dry,"In a word boring. Want another word: pointless. This is the most boring book I have ever read cover to cover. Normally I'd give up earlier on a turkey like this, but hey it was a long flight and Grisham's are always entertaining... or so I thought.Let me save you the trouble. Story line in brief:. young boy grows up in rural cotton country. help arrives in the summer. two murders happen. suspense builds, until key characters disappear for good. rains wash away crops. family leaves rural cotton countryYes that's it. If you'd like to learn how boring cotton farming is- buy the book. If you like books with plot, entertainment value, character development and some occassional suspense, pass this one by."
1,The Painter House,Of all the books John Grisham I think this is the most boring and mundane book I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was because I actually thought it would imrove. I will not buy any more of his books untill someone else whose opinion I trust reads it first. I felt this was a waste of time and money! Do not recommend this book to anyone I know!
2,"Re-title this to ""How I Spent My Summer"" by Luke C., Age 7","In essence the book was about the summer experience of Luke Chandler, a seven year old. The book contained observations and story-line introductions but no resolutions or endings to dilemmas that had been introduced during the telling. It was a decent read, the writing definitely had a nostalgic flavor and a nice feel, but there was no real story. Therefore, there was no real ending. It is too bad, the characters and their situations held potential for a good story - but it all fell way short at the end."
5,See also Ferrol Sams,"I think that this book is very similar to the ""Run With the Horsemen"" series that Ferrol Sams wrote. I enjoyed those books as well as this one."
2,Should have been submitted to Readers Digest,"I have read everyone of John Grisham's books and have viewed a short story of his, ""The Gingerbread Man"", that was made into a movie. This is more of the type of story that I'd expect to read in the condensed area of a Readers Digest monthly publication, or in an old issue of Saturday Morning Post. The story line did bring back memories of my childhood, but as to the story line it should have probably been published as a children's book. I finished listening to the unabridged tapes with a diffenent sense of being ripped off and wanting my money back. Two stars for the memories."
2,Story Never Takes Off,"Grisham leaves the courtrooms for cotton fields in what appears to be an attempt to write a Faulkner-type tale. The author does live up to his reputation as an inventive, plot-driven storyteller, but bottom line is this book does more exploring the fact that farming is a tough gig than it does creating a riveting work of fiction."
1,Slower than a sedated snail,"Bought this book expecting a regular Grisham potboiler, and found myself sorely disappointed. Found the characters, themes, language, everything about The Painted House banal,trite and downright boring. Finished the book only out of respect for one of my favourite authors, and prayed that he goes back to writing brilliant reads like Runaway Jury and The Brethren."
1,"SLOW, SLOWER, SLOWEST","This was the slowest most boring book I have read in along time. Please don't waste your time. It starts out slow, never gets going and then unbelievably crashes to a stop on the last page mercifully. There is absolutely no plot or action in this book. It's as exciting as watching paint dry literally."
2,BORING!!!,"Well, was I surpised. Mr. Grisham has certainly changed gears on this one. After reading and thoroughly enjoying the suspense and characters of his previous novels, I was quite disappointed in this one. Ok,Ok, life on a cotton farm in the 50's was no great way to grow up but this book didn't quite captivate me. I don't find any interest in a 7 year old boy watching a 14 year old girl take a bath in the river. The characters are explained in depth but are not followed through to the end. What happens to Ricky, Miguel and his new wife, the family they take in from the flood,etc. And what does painting the house have to do with anything! I guess he is setting us up for the sequel. I did enjoy the baseball references and will probably read any future books of his just based on his past endeavors."
2,Disappointing,"Mr. Grisham would have been better served to write this under a different name. Those of us who savor ""Grishams"" will be disappointed."
3,A real departure for Grisham,"This story is quite a departure from the usual Grisham epic. It's a pleasant tale of a young boy's experience growing up in rural Arkansas. The boy is only seven years old and as he relates the story it is a little unbelievable in the detail for one of that tender age. I cannot imagine a boy so young speaking in such a way. It would have been more easily believed had the character been ten or twelve years old. Nonetheless, it's a very readable account, but don't expect any excitement or surprises. I don't think this is a good direction for Grisham to head and I can only hope he returns to the type of story he does so well."
5,Grisham Delivers Again,"Who would have thought the Grisham could write multiple books outside of the legal genre that were so successful. I'll be honest as a law student and a big Grisham fan I was hesitant to read ""A Painted House."" However after reading ""Bleachers"" I quickly overcame my fear of Grisham's new style. I guess it just took a little bit of faith. Personally I am not a big fan of sequels but I really would like to see one in this case. Grisham does a great job of character development in this book. He sucks you in and leaves you wanting more so you know the next installment in the characters lives.Grisham has now written about three things I know about (Law, Football, and Farming). So far he has delivered dead on classics in all three of these categories. I think he has now proven that he is one of the better writers of our time. I can't wait to read more of what have been heralded as his ""lawyerless"" stories"
2,Boring!,"I do not normally read Grisham as I am not enthralled by his writing of things legal, but this was our book club selecttion and I read it. I too kept waiting for something exciting or interesting even to happen, and it never did. Had I not needed to finish it for discussion sake at our Book club meeting, I would have quit it. The end was a let down as well. So Grishman did not get a fan when he deviated from his norm...Boo hiss!"
4,A Painted House Paints a new Picture of Grisham,"I was pleasantly surprised with A PAINTED HOUSE. Grisham, in my opinion, showed a side of his talent that brought to mind Steinbeck or James Lee Burke. Very descriptive tale of a seven year old boy, and life on a cotton farm in rural Arkansas in the early '50s. Not a lawyer in sight!"
1,Waste of time,"I truly believe if I had written this book, no one would have published it. Talk about resting on your laurels. My advice for John Grisham is to stick with what you do best."
3,alright book,"I did like this adventure mystery by john grisham, but I think that he could have done a bit better than that. I did like the way that is was like a courtroom drama, but not in a courtroom, and i like how it was solved through out the book. I defintly think john grisham could have done better on writing this book by solving it a bit faster. 438 pages is too much for a small mystery like this book. So I think that this book is barely passable."
2,Quite Disappointing,"Frankly, I expected much more from this book after reading other books from him. This time, Grisham veers totally away from law and instead plunges himself to write about a boy, Luke Chandler, growing up in rural Arkansas.After a whole bit of introduction and description, I was expecting some form of suspense and mystery abounding. Yet, as I kept reading, I didn't feel the least excited or scared. The story took expected turns and even the murders weren't really exciting.I was really disappointed and raced along trying to find some form of suspense but never found any. It left me with a bitter taste in the mouth after i finished reading it.Perhaps the only salvaging part is grisham's good description and style of writing which made the sotry bearable and not boring. Still, i was quite disappointed."
2,Grisham has lost it,Grishman latest is not even a pot boiler. The pot never boils. If one is interested in a day to day events of a rather dull life--this book is for you. It is a shame when Grisham has written so many good and eventful books that he has dwscended to this level. Has he run out of material??
1,Change is not good,"I have purchased and read every book this gentleman has produced, and the reason I have is because I like stories about law and lawyers. Mr. Grisham has broken from his traditional story, and with it has gone his ability to tell an interesting story. He should return to what he knows best. The Painted House was a horrible waste of talent and skill. I hope that Mr. Grisham returns to his more traditional book, and stays away from pretending to be a seven year old boy, because his seven year old boy had more of the characteristics of being a teenage adolecent."
2,Disappointed,"I am a Grisham fan, having read all of his books, thus far. The ending was as disappointing as the story itself. Not his usual intense work holding the reader spellbound from beginning to end. Get back on track Mr. Grisham, and please no sequil to ""A Painted House"", though I seem to be in the minority in my opinion."
2,non-eventful,"Being an avid Grisham reader I always snap up a copy of his latest novel in order to be carried away, if for only a short time, in fast action, suspense and puzzle-solving. Although this book is of course well written, I have been sorely dissappointed in the plot - or lack of one. I read Grisham books in order to be swept away and this one swept me in a corner with nowhere to go but to sleep. When I was half way through the book clinging only to two fights and a bare chest for excitement, I began to lose interest. I wish I had borrowed it from the library."
4,A pleasant surprise,"I kept looking for a lawyer, but I was not disappointed. This departure from previous Grisham books kept me captivated for 48 hours. This was a charming story, with characters I fell in love with. I love john Grisham's sublte sense of humor and the way he tells a story. I highly recommend this book."
3,Simpler Times,"If you find your world filled with phone calls, work, and too much technology, here is a story that will take you back to simpler times.An endearing story about a family who lives on a cotton farm in Arkansas in the early 1950s, as told by 7-year old Luke Chandler. You get a true sense of the simple blessings in their lives. There are hardships but with love and determination, this family gets through it all.It's a story about family, faith, farming, dreams, baseball, and secrets.What an refreshing change of pace"
3,Don't Bash This Book So Much,"I am not a huge Grisham fan being that I am only 16 years old. I read this book not because of the imfamous author, but because an older friend of mine had it and I am an excessive reader of everything. This book was good because it was easy to read. Over the summer you may find little to do, but I read this book. It was an easy plot with a story line you dont find in adult books today. Also, it gave an accurate insight to a life with different concerns then most. Floods, neigbors, not enough food to eat, all were tragedies wich filled my heart for this poor country family. So, don't bash this book because you feel betrayed by the author. I enjoyed it very much."
3,Eh.. could have been worse!,"I thought John Grisham's ""A PAINTED HOUSE"" was ok. there are some parts of the book that are very slow, while there are others that pick up the pace. it is definitely not a ""traditional"" fast paced grisham book, so don't expect it. if you would like a nice story this is the book for you. I do believe that the ending was quite abrupt and it left a lot open. I don't know if this was intentional or not. I would have liked to seen a more definite conclusion to all of the story lines that were left open."
4,A very well written book,"No, this is not a typical John Grisham story, but so what? I found it to be a very well written and very interesting story. Reading through some of the reviews I am amazed. One person said that they would not read another book by Grisham without reading the reviews first. Now that is an open mind for you. Let someone else decide for you how good the book is. I personally never read the reviews until after I have read the book. Some complained of it being boring. Believe it or not good books can be written without non-stop action and unbelievable heroics. John Grisham showed that he is versitile enough to write a totaly different type of story than he normally writes. Good for him. This may not be the type of book you would read yourself, but it is a GOOD book."
1,Unlike John Grisham,"This book was written off of the normal track for John Grisham. Though the book was written well, it came out of the blue for him. I enjoyed all of his other books and I consider myself to be an avid Grisham fan. I was however, disappointed in the off the wall story line of this book. I would like to see Mr. Grisham go back to writing books like his earlier ones."
1,Goodbye John Grisham...,"I read Grishams previous book, The Brethren and swore off reading Grisham again, to me he had taken the path oft travelled and became formulaic. I could not believe he could write something so badly conceived and full of holes, maybe he didn't write it. Anyhow this has nothing to do with his latest book other than I won't be buying it."
1,Snooze fest,Someone else said it was like watching paint dry. I wished it had been that much fun. I had to force myself to finish this book. I just knew SOMETHING was going to happen. And in the end something great happened... The book was over.
2,Needs More Than Paint,A remarkably mediocre novel that I labored through waiting for something to happen. It never did.
1,Pointless,"Wow! That was a boring book full of stories that had no point at all. I felt like he just sort of stopped writing once he reached 300 or 400 (whatever it is) pages. So far 3 other family members have read it and came to the same conclusion.Not worth the time, even if you get a copy for free."
3,Not the John we have come to love and appreciate!,"I have been an avid Grisham fan since his 1st book, many times reading them over a very short time frame. While this book demonstrates the quality of a fine author, its content and storyline is not consistent with what we have come to expect. John would have helped himself by writing this under a different name- but then it wouldn't have seized upon the John Grisham fame. I'll have to investigate his next book prior to ""running out"" and buying a copy (like I do everytime) to see if I really want to own it."
2,Please stab my spleen now,"Having corn flakes with powdered milk (no water) isn't as dry as this book. I found myself (much like I did with The Catcher in the Rye)reading only because I kept waiting for something monumental to happen, which never did. There were no surprises in this story, save one, which was about as shocking as pissing on an electric fence and then realizing it's not electric afterall. Plus, when Grisham dropped this ""bomb"" on me, I didn't even give a damn because by then it was such a tiny part of the story. My advice is to read something else by John--anything else--and feed this one to the fireplace."
2,A sequel would change my mind.........,"I don't wish to undermine this book as it was a page turner for me. I was totally caught up in the characters. However, the ending was most disappointing for me. The story lines were just not ""wrapped up"". I always enjoy a book that leaves me wanting for more, but unless there is a sequel in the works, this one just left me feeling a little cheated out of a complete ending. One more chapter would have made this a 4 to 5 star book for me!"
1,There was no point to this book.,"I am deeply upset that I even read this book. Don't get me wrong, I read my fair share of books. I just like it when they have some sort of a... I don't know...PLOT! This book just rambles on and on. So many parts in the book could have become something interesting, but none of them ever did. The worst part is that the only character I ever felt anything at all for was Ricky, who doesn't even appear in the book. He's only mentioned.And the ending of the book was awful as well. It was filled with loose ends and left me wondering. Nothing was ever resolved. This book had no point."
2,A Faded Painted House,I was dissappointed in A Painted House. I felt that mister Grisham was writing down to his subject matter. The Chandler's daily routine was boring and repeticious. I also feel that mister Grisham left to many lose ends when he got down to resolving everything.
1,A Painted House,Sorry. This one just didn't hit me. I thought it was very boring and kept waiting for something exciting to happen. Even the ending was a letdown. Outside of a couple of murders there was no excitement. And certainly no mystery.
5,The Best American Story-Teller Without A Doubt!,"Europe had Charles Dickens. America had Jack London. 20th & 21st America has John Grisham. What a marvel of a story-teller. This priceless book is the best book possibly ever written about the Old South, U.S.A. in the 1950's. Everyone with a living memory of this time and place will be amazed at how John Grisham captures the very esssence of poor whites in the South. He does an honor and credit to our country in telling the truths, social mannerisms, and moral underpinnings of our nation. John Grisham does for America what Honore Balzac did for France in producing the greatest fiction novels of all time."
5,"Good, but not the normal John Grisham","I enjoyed this book....it didn't seem to be the same as most of his books, very untypical of John Grisham....but the story was good.I felt for the little boy in the story, but he probably didn't know anything else."
3,it started good but the ending was nothing spectacular,"After seing so many positive reviews i deceided to give this book a try. I must say it was interesting especially for a big city girl like me. I truely didnt know anything about farming and thought this would be real boring but to my surprise it wasnt.Its very well written Luke, the 7 year old kid knows a lot of secrets and i can see that happening in real life as grown ups tend to trust kids with their secrets more than anyone else for some reason. I could also see myself telling a kid secrets...lolI didnt like the end so I have to subtract 2 stars. WHere was the plot? Nothing really happened. I dont know why it was titled ""the painted house"", it should have been more the likely ""The mysteries farm"" or something. Maybe i missed something i dont know how some people see this book as one of the best books they ever read.Its okay to read but dont expect too much."
2,A Painted House,"This is the first non-lawyer Grisham novel I have read. As with most of his books, it was easy to read. But, in the end, he blew it. As others have complained, the ending goes nowhere. He had an opportunity to make a moral statement about the seven-year old boy's concealment of secrets, including murder, throughout the novel. In the end, the only thing the reader is left with is ""Small boy lies, gets away with it, and moves out-of-town. Appears to learn nothing about life other than occasionally you can get away with deceit."" As with too many post-modern novels, there is, in the end, nothing at all for the reader to contemplate."
4,Keeps a good grip,"Absorbing, The author keeps your atention through the eyes of a 7 yr old boy, Luke. Luke's narrative illustrated perhaps what the good ol life in southern USA was like in the 40's - cotton, religion, baseball,heat, first TVs, family , work and relationships."
4,Lovely read,"Stopped reading J Grishm years ago, but I really liked this story. Discriptions of work & people v believable. Sad story . Iwould recommend this book to my friends , may buy a few as gifts for Christmas."
1,Don't buy if you're looking for a legal thriller!,"When Grisham's The Firm was released, it was the first fiction book I read in many, many years. He convinced me that I could really enjoy reading a book. I got hooked on legal thrillers. Buying this book, Painted House, was a huge mistake. It's not a legal thriller. Nevertheless, I kept hoping it would grab my interest, but it didn't. I tossed out the book after reading about 1/2 of it (and checking the ending to make sure I wouldn't miss anything by tossing it out)."
2,Did I miss something?,"So many people have said A PAINTED HOUSE is an excellent work. Even Grisham has said it's one of his favorites. So why did I feel so let down by this book? It's a sweet story; it does evoke a time and place beautifully. We come to see and care for the characters. All the elements are in place for a true classic...and then the plot goes no where. Without giving too much of the story away, let me suggest some of the themes that begged for conclusion: race relations; class distictions; crime and punishment; truth-telling vs. secret-keeping. I can not recommend this book. And it certainly is not in the same league as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD."
3,It needs a sequel,This lovely novel of Grisham's needs part two. It got me involved and then left me hanging. The ending left me hungry for more. I couldn't believe that was all. So many questions left unanswered. Not having ever been to the South or never having seen cotton grow I feel like the story for me is incomplete. I need to learn more about Luke's life and home. Another book of Luke in his teens or coming home would be nice. Keep writing it Mr.Grisham. I buy everything you write.I enjoyed The Testament best of all.
3,Not up to Par,"Overall I do not think this book is up to par with Grisham's other works. The picture picture he painted of the hard working era is excellent., However, at times he seemed to drag on with minute details that were not completely necessary.It is common to leave storylines open so a sequel can be written. However, I doubt this story will feed another book. Having said that, I think there were two story lines left open that should have been brought to a conclusion.As a Father, I would love to meet a 7 year old that was a mature and responsible as Luke. I can just imagine what my house would have looked like if my son had painted it when he was 7."
3,Generally ok,"I found the book rather slow and draggy at times. Some of the parts seemed almost repeated. But it is interesting to know more about countryside America through the eyes of a 7-year-old (considering I have always lived in an urban Singapore). The characters are mostly rather built up through the story and I appreciated the ending where the family warmness could be felt, although not very strongly. Good attempt to say the least."
2,Want to be a rural farmer?,"If you were considering a move to rural America to experience the thrills of owning your own private farm, then this book is a must read. Otherwise choose another book!Most Grisham books are captivating. I really enjoyed ""The Firm"", ""The Partner"" and ""The Summons"". While ""A Painted House"" is a well told literary story, I actually found it quite boring. My guess is he wrote it to proove to himeself and maybe his peers that he can write as well as other authors even in the absence of a compelling story."
4,Good to see another side of Grisham,"I was glad when I finished A Painted House, because I thought somewhere in the book there would be a drawn out scene in a courtroom, but it ended up being a great novel that I thoroughly enjoyed. It was slow, but captivating and I would recommend it to anyone who has a taste for great writing and a good novel."
3,Seems oddly familar!,"A Painted House, is a coming of age story set in the cotton fields of rural Arkansas. 7-year-old Luke Chandler, who already seems older than his years, matures even more through many events he witnesses in the Summer of 1952.The only thing I really didn't like about this book is that I've read it before. 'To Kill A Mockingbird' by Harper Lee and 'Sometimes There's A Dove' by lesser known Mississippi author, Cynthia Ward. Maybe I was just tired of the rural, country tales by the time I got to 'A Painted House.' But it seemes as if he read both of these books and fused them into, 'A Painted House.'Grisham should stick with what he writes best...Legal thrillers...In my humble opinion."
5,"Not a lawerly story, but an interesting tale nonetheless...","I picked up the novel being an avid Grisham fan from the older series of The Firm, The Chamber, The Pelican Brief, etc. And I was quite suprised to see an entire departure from these forms of story. However, I found the book to be a page-turning mystery of interest to me and thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,A Painted House - down the road,"I was so very excited about the A Painted House when I heard about it. The story takes place just down the road from where I grew up. Black Oak, Ar. is about 4 miles from my families farm. Mr Grisham's family owns the land next to my Dad's so you can understand my excitement. The book was very well written as are all of his books and it brought back many memories of my childhood. I even learned some things I did not remember. I look forward to each new book John Grisham puts out, as each one seems to be a little better than the last."
2,A god damn boring book with no plot at all,"I was very disappointed with this book as it was god damn boring.I was very patient with the book and i waited for the plot to develop.However,there isn't a plot at all and the characters were poorly developed.The story just rambled on and on about how hard farm life is.Don't pick up this book unless u are really a fan of his...."
1,A Painted House,"This book should have been named ""Watching Paint Dry."" I found it very boring. It was astounding that a 7 year old boy could witness so much in a such a brief time span. His narration of it made it very hard to believe that we were seeing this story through his eyes. He was much older in his observations and thoughts than his chronological age would convey. The plot never really pulled together for me. It was a waste of time. I am not a Grisham fan, but gave him another chance because a friend told me this one was ""different."" Maybe a different story line, but the same mediocre writiing style."
1,Save your money!,I am a big Grisham fan but this book was not worth the cost. I quit reading about half way through because I lost total interest in the story line and the characters. The story line was dull and exceedingly boring. When I reached the point that I did not care what happened to the seven year old protagonist or his family it was time to give this book away.
3,Boring,"For some reason, this book was very hard for me to get through and a slow read. I love most Grisham books, but this was not one of my favorites"
2,A Disappointment,"The story line was frustrating. I found it very hard to believe that a seven year old boy could be a part of so many secrets and not be overwhelmed! The ending, or lack thereof(!), was especially disappointing."
4,The Painted House,This book starts out very slow. Keep reading as the heat of Arkansas draws you into the storyline. One of his best books.
3,Not a John Grisham story,"I just finished The Testament and wanted another Grisham book, to my suprise this didn't fill my need. It's just not your typical John Grisham."
4,DIFFERENT FOR GRISHAM,This was a pretty solid book a good read but a definite turn from the typical john grisham novel. If this is your first grisham novel to read do not judge the rest of them by it. Wish grisham wuld put out a book a little more often
3,Unexpected,"This was a hard book to rate for me. John Grisham is an excellent writer as this book once again proves. Unfortunately, it's not my type. I'll no longer be able to just pick up every JG book & be sure I'll enjoy it. I started this book knowing it was a new venture for JG but still expecting the suspense and fast pace of his previous works. Needless to say, I was a little shocked at what I found. Yes, he did a wonderful job of describing life in that time & place, but it was extremely slow to me. It's not the type of book I look for & enjoy at all. I kept waiting for the story line to pick up & it never did. I will have to say I was disappointed. I can certainly understand a lot of the 5 stars this book received, because if this is the type of story a person enjoys well they couldn't have found much better. Unfortunately, it's not my type & not at all what I expected. I'll no longer be able to just pick up every JG book & expect to enjoy it; I'll have to check it out first."
4,Surprisingly different,"John Grisham surprised me with this story, but pleasantly so. He did not fail to keep my attention. He is indeed a wonderful story teller. I don't normally like sequels but would love to know what happens to Luke in the big city and whether he eventually fulfills his dream of becoming a national baseball player. Grisham conveyed such a descriptive setting in the cotton fields. I felt like I was on the ground beside Luke as he looked up to the sky between the tall plants. I was leary at first, knowing that Grisham has written most of his books around the legal world. This story, particularly, took me back to days I've heard of from my grandparents and parents. I actually felt as though I were stepping back in time. He is truly one of the best writers I have read!"
1,Worst yet,"I've enjoyed all Grisham books except The Street Lawyer so far, but this one is a sleeping pill. Only one word discribes it best. Boring!"
2,Disappointing,"It is understandable that Grisham has chosen to deviate from his usual story line. Unfortunately, it didn't work. I usually read a Grisham novel in 24 hours. This one took a week! Even though the book had many of the same elements of his previous novels, it lacked the excitement and I missed the ambition usually shown by the characters. I still love this author and I'll buy his next book."
4,Great story...,"Great story about farm life in the Midwest. If you grew up there as I did, you will appreciate this book."
5,John Grisham,I don't think there has been anything that John Grisham has written that I didn't enjoy. He keeps you involved in the story - always.
5,couldn't put it down,"I am a huge John Grisham fan, and even though this is not his normal lawyer suspense, it is well worth reading. As always with his work, this is very well written..makes the characters come alive.I would also recommend reading Playing for Pizza, another of his novels that is not typical of his writting"
3,Self-Indulgence,"John Grisham has given us so many entertaining stories that I suppose he deserves to indulge himself a bit. I hope he doesn't do it too often or he will find himself losing readers. This book was filled with laborsome description and narrative. Action was sparse, suspense and literary tension almost non-existent. Worst of all, however, was the totally unbelievable seven-year child speaking through the voice of an articulate 40-year-old man. This is kind of surprising, because if I remember right, he did a pretty good job with an eleven year old kid in ""The Client."" I wish John Grisham luck. I hope this book worked off his need for self indulgence and clears the way for getting back down to work entertaining us."
5,FABULOUS-A new Grisham genre. Move over Jim Lehrer. Encore!,"At first I was a little hesitant to read a Grisham that was not about lawyers and courtroom suspense. But after I got started, I couldn't put it down--finished it in two days at the time that I was testing my college algebra class for finals. Grisham carefully weaves his story around the grinding poverty of mid-1900s Arkansas cotton farmers. Racial & socioeconomic stereotypes are used liberally, but he is telling it ""like it was."" If you like Jim Lehrer's ""One-Eyed Jack"", you will love Grisham's Arkansas cotton farmers. It is about people and touches the heart. He develops characters you can care about--and some you can't wait to see meet their just desserts. And the one thing I really liked about it was the way he handled Ricky at the end of the book. One resolution would have been so pathetically predictable that I was hoping he wouldn't use it."
5,Stays With You,"I'm glad Grisham took this departure. It really worked for me. I've often tried to understand what makes a classic a classic. The fact that this story stayed with me for several weeks and kept coming to mind in the same pleasant mental context of 'The Grapes of Wrath' and 'To Kill a Mockingbird' may just be enough for me. I was able to live the story, enjoy the tight family unit, and become involved with the hopes, dreams and sorrows. I was a 7 year old that enjoyed being a kid and never wanted anything to change so this was very reminiscent."
5,Real Life,"I loved the book because it is so real. This isn't based JUST on Grisham's life. The ""hill people"" of Arkansas are as real as my father and grandfather,(and thousands of other grandfathers!) The stories I heard from my Dad about pickin' cotton on someone else's farm until his fingers bled. The mean old mountain man that was killed in the middle of town and no one said a word because they all felt he deserved it. My Dad left Salesville, Arkansas, (outside of Mountain Home) for the GM factory in the late 50's, thousands of other people did the same,because they all had the same dream. A better life for their children. Thank you Mr. Grisham, you touched my heart!"
4,"The easy style of Grisham, with a great new storyline!","I've always found John Grisham's writing style a nice, comfortable read. His legal stories have been great books to read on the plane or when traveling. ""A Painted House"" continued in that easy, comfortable style, with a storyline that was more personal and intriguing to read. Told through the eyes of a 7-year-old, this story demonstrates the demons that can haunt a child when they are thrown into a grown-up world, full of secrets and tough decisions. I loved the way Grisham supports the child as often the wisest one in the family regarding when to ""tell the secrets"" and when it is better to not share things with anyone."
2,Not My Kind of Grisham,"I read this in serialized form in ""Oxford"" magazine..... Good story, but I had no trouble waiting for the next installment. The 7 year old central character was delightful, but other characters were flat and somewhat dull. I kept waiting for some spark that never came. Grisham is a favorite of mine and I was very disappointed."
4,a good read,"this book's about a farm boy, luke chandler who lives on a cotton farm. it talks about his time on th farm and how he survives a particular cotton picking season when some troublesome hill people and mexicans come to town.you probably think farm = boring, but it isnt. it is actually quite dramatic in all the emotions and secrets that are kept throughout the book. however there is not a very clear major climax. the ending of the book is uncomplete and leaves you unsatisfied."
3,A pleasant trip into a quieter time,"As a period novel, A Painted House accurately and successfully transports the reader to a quieter, more immediate time--I felt the drudgery and dull desperation of cotton farming seep into my own emotions as I read. Rare moments of tension and suspense are properly dwarfed by more significant observations about people, particularly as shared by a young boy not yet jaded by an accumulation of adult experiences.Having read all of Grisham's other works, I found this book a happy diversion which lost none of its charm through lacking a legal backdrop for its story.The plot, as it exists, satisfies, and details produce a whole picture, though by no means a classic one."
2,dISAPPOINTING!,"John Grisham is a talented writer...but you'd never know it from this book. This must be the season for ""old times"" books...but Baldocci did it much better! The book is slow to start and only has a couple of minor interesting sections. While normally I read a book straight through, I kept putting this one down to reread another favorite..even one of Grisham's. Gave mine to the senior's library! It will probably help them go to sleep."
2,not what you expect from grisham,I was extremely dissapointed in the book-it was nothing like the Grisham books I have loved in the past. This is not in any way lawyer or crime related. It is just a simple book about simple people in a pretty simple way of life. I'd say pass on this one.
2,Grisham is not Faulkner,"Grisham ventures out of his familar environment of law and into world of sharecroppers and white trash which Faulkner did so well.He should have stuck with the familar, he's definitely not in Faulkner's class with these topics."
2,Not Grisham,"The reason I buy John Grisham's books is because of the subject matter, legal thrillers. That's what I like and that's what he does best. This type of book didn't interest me and I hope he goes back to what he does best."
2,"No lawyers in this, thank God","Well Grisham had tried something new and it sells because of his name. There is a murder and ""mystery"" on a rough and tumble setting. I prefer a mystery that makes me think a bit after I finish the book. This does not. A much more provocative read is Defenders of the Holy Grail by Ken Agori."
4,the painted house,"I'd gotten a little disappointed in Grisham lately because I thought his writing had become second rate. This was a delightful book, sure not the ""usual Grisham you were expecting. But what a well written slice of our past in America"
3,A Mediocre Grisham,I agree with the reviewers who felt that Luke was an unbelievably mature 7 year old... I had him pegged at 11 or 12 and that made the story much less credible.I also agree that the ending was weak. We never knew whether Ricky returned from the War and a murderer was allowed his freedom in spite of the fact that he had just run off with a young woman who was innocent of his crime.
2,Disappointing,"This was a pretty weak storyline. I am usually a Grisholm fan, but this left me a little disappointed. The novel drags on without many captivating scenes.With all the great novels out, including some other Grisholm books, I would recommend a pass on this one."
2,What happened to the ending?,1ST let me say I love John Grisham but this was not one of his best works. It was if the story just ended. You want to see what happens to the characters when you read a book and this one just left you hanging. Not one story line was finished. You get to a point in the book and think it must be coming up...then you realize you only have 20 pages left and he can't tie up all the loose ends. The ending of this book was a big disappointment.
2,Not his style book,"I dislike the direction this author is taking. His books are usually compelling and interesting. This story I had to keep reading in hopes it would be more interesting and move faster, which it never did. If this is the new direction I will not be reading this author any more."
5,oops he did it again!!,"Grisham did it again, this time going outside of the legal loop. I was skeptical to read this book given the fact that I love all of Grisham's ""legal thrillers"" and thought what could he possibly know outside of this realm? EVERYTHING! Brillantly descriptive, this story reads like a Steinbeck Classic only in Arkansas. This is a story about a young boy, Luke Chandler, and his farming family. Murder, adventure, secrets bring Luke and all of the characters in this book alive! Grisham, you definitely need to write a sequel to this one!"
4,A wonderful American novel,"This is not Grisham as you are used to his work. No lawyers. No courtrooms. Just a terrific American story full of fascinating characters and a plot surrounding a dark secret. The narrator is a child, but this is not a childish book. The narrator tells you what happened from his point of view and it works. Sit back and relax. This is a really good read."
3,A Half Painted House,"As with ""Skipping Christmas"", I was once again left wanting a little more from my favorite author. Grisham does his usual great job of developing characters in short order, but I couldn't help but yell ""Noooooooo"" a few times at the turns the story took. They just didn't fit. I did, however, thoroughly enjoy Grisham's recollection of childhood that compared the all important outside world (the Cardinals) to the mundane (the farm) as seen through most 7 year olds."
3,"Great characters, A little slow","This book was a Christmas gift. I had set my expectations based on movies from Grisham novels. This was a good read, but didn't have the same suspense as I expected. I really enjoyed the book being written from a seven year old's perspective. The characters were very well developed and unique. I liked that."
4,Summer tension,"As a fan of Grisham's legal thrillers, I bought this only on the basis of jacket notes. I was not disappointed.It is not a legal thriller. It is about rural life in the 1950s in the American mid west for poor farmers struggling to get by, from the viewpoint of a young boy.It is not fast paced except for the occasional burst of overt violence. But it does entice you into reading more, eager to know what happens next to young Luke.I have often wondered if this is part autobiography, as there are similarities to Grisham's own background.The characters are real. The plot is excellent. The only possible criticism is the pace. Sometimes it does seem to crawl along at the pace of cotton growing in the summer heat. This is more a comment on me than on the book as the overall effect matches the essence of the story very well.Grisham demonstrates his ability beyond the legal genre and captivates his audience."
3,A good story,"I enjoyed the book but the ending could have been better. Also, the story could have been shorter to reach the same conclusion. The story began to drag toward the end. However, the characters were very interesting. And the story was told in great detail with a lot of humor attached. This book is worth reading. Just don't expect a stellar ending."
3,A let down for Grisham fans,"I've read all of John Grishams books, and have anxiously awaited each new publication. This book, though fine in its story telling, left me searching for more around each page. I kept waited for a Grishamesque character to come into play, and was sorely disappointed by the end of the book. I will continue to buy his books, but perhaps will buy the used version instead of shelling out $20.00 for a hard cover book that I wouldnt want to share with any of my other book loving friends!"
5,probaly his best ever,"i have just started reading his novels and surprisingly this was the best one. it tells the story of a 7 year's olds life in arkansas on a cotton farm. it tells the story of how hard life was, how people like me who grew up in the city just can't begin to understand how hard farmers have it. their family hires 2 sets of workers to help bring in the cotton and they tell of the simple everyday joys and heartaches that are dear to any family. a story well worth reading."
5,His best yet,"I just finished A Painted House, and already I am wishing for a sequel. I have loved all of Grisham's legal thrillers (except perhaps The Testament), and was disappointed when I realized this was not. But this must be his best! You don't have to grown up in the South nor picked cotton to identify with this 7-year old."
3,Slow but sweet,"I was able to read this book because it was published in serial fashion in the Oxford magazine. It was a disappointment since I am used to his legals thrillers. It was interesting to learn about the the era and the life of the cotten pickers. Still I kept buying the magazine, so it did keep my interest. I was a little disappointed in the ending, but Grisham tends to do that from time to time."
3,A Painted House,"I have read all of your books and now reading this book. I am having a hard time because it is reminding me of 2 other books written by mystery authors who have stepped away from the norm. One is Stephen King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and the other is I believe Stephen Martini I might be wrong. He wrote a book about the two children in a car with mother and father and the accident and the father, who wasa writer got killed and their mother was comotuse and theyhad to go live with their grandmother in the mountains. I am having a hard time because it reminds me of each and cheapens it. My 2 favorites of all your books were The Chamber and The client and I loved the rest. I dont know if I can even finish it and I've waited for ""The House"" for ages."
4,Of simplier times,"I loved the whole of this book. It takes you back to simplier times when there was no hussle and bussle of the city or deadlines or traffic jams. The food that kept you fed was by your own hand. You worked hard for what you had, but you knew what you were about and took pride in your hard work. It was all about family life. John Grisham kept me reading. But, I did feel left hanging at the end. There were so many things that happened in the book which I had no answers for as to their own outcomes. The ending definately leaves room for a sequel."
1,DISGRACE FOR GRISHAM,"Ths was the worst by far book that read from John Grsham.It was narrated by a 7 year old boy ,Luke. I read 275 pages, wth great dffculty!!! but stll almost nothng happened. I REALLY HATED THIS BOOK. I thnk Grsham should stck to what he knows best.Lawyers, judges , crooks....."
1,farmer story,"This is the 1st Grisham, which is hard to read. Compared to his earlier books it is about a totaly diffrent topic (90% of the book is about farming). I would not buy this one!"
2,Worst Yet,This is the first book of Grisham's that I had little to no desire to even finish. It is by far the worst book he has written to date.
1,The biggest waste of paper yet!,"What was Mr. Grisham thinking? Mundane to say the least. I forced myself to finish it believing that it just had to get better, and then, I fed the fireplace."
3,It's worth reading.,"A painted house was a fairly decent book. It is worth reading, but its not a book you would want to read again, at least not for a long time. The plot of the whole book was good, but it just ended with so many things unsolved. There were too many secrets that Luke, the boy, kept and nothing ever came of them. If it had more actions in it, and actually talked about what happened between each promise then it would be a much better book. Over all it was average and I would recommend reading it. I would have to say that A Time to Kill was probably his best book I have read yet, but I have only read about five of John Grishman's books."
2,"Just ok, not Grisham's best...","Disclosure: I'm a big fan of John Grisham - A Time to Kill, The Firm and The Testament being my favorites. And I adore ""slice of life"" books; so it was with great expectation that I looked forward to reading this new one of Grisham's. His dialogue is believable and engaging, as usual. His characters are well drawn, as usual. He writes about important stuff: family ties, honor, integrity, truthfulness, wisdom, youth, and hard work. But, notwithstanding all these great elements, to me this book lacked ""ummph."" The story line was slow paced and uncompelling - I kept wondering when the plot was going to kick in. This just wasn't one of Grisham's best works, in my humble opinion..."
4,Not like the rest,"I have read ALL of Grisham's works -- even before he was well known. I like his novels and seek him out. He is a brilliant writer. His mastery of the word puts readers on the edge of their chairs. He constructs a good story and knows how to tell it.A PAINTED HOUSE is different. Although he employs his well-honed mastery of the English language, I didn't like the story. This is not to say A PAINTED HOUSE is a bad story. It simply is not what I expected from Grisham. Two issues in particular: First, I was expecting a lawyer to appear on the following page. However each page I turned, the lawyer never showed up. The Chandler family could have used a lawyer. Well, may be not. Second, there are many loose ends and unanswered questions with this novel. Some people like that, I'm not one of them. I found the ending annoyingly abrupt. However, if there is a part II to A PAINTED HOUSE, I will be first in line to read it."
2,Not what I expected,"I am a huge John Grisham fan but I enjoyed John Grisham's past books much better than A Painted House. I, like so many other reviewers, purchased this book in anticipation of reading a gripping book that you just couldn't put down. It took me forever to read this book and the only reason I finished it was by sheer determination. It is John Grisham's choice to change his writing style and it was probably refreshing for him but it is not the style that his fans want and not the style that will sell the next time."
4,Southern Critic,"Mr. Grisham, stay in the field and out of the courtroom for a while! I've enjoyed the legal novels in the past, but this book was a great change of genre. From a southerner's point of view, your treatment of the characters was very realistic. KEEP IT UP."
5,What? No Lawyers?,"I love John Grisham and have read nearly every book he has written, and have enjoyed them all emensely. But this was a wonderful change of pace from the intense court dramas we have become used to. This is a refreshing change for Grisham and an absolute ""can't put it down"" novel. A truly delightful story as told by young boy, Luke Chandler, living on a cotton farm in Black Oak Arkansas in the early 1950's. We see through his eyes, the joys and hardships of farming, and the adventures of a boy in a small town. Highly recommended, and thank you John Grisham for a great read."
3,Not as great as Under a Ragin Moon but good....,"THIS CD. SEEMS TO BE RUSH MADE. THE PRODUCER IS THE SAME AS ""UNDER A RAGIN MOON"". THERE IS A GREAT TUNE PENNED BY RUSS BALLARD (HIS CDS ARE VERY VERY GOOD), AND ON PARTICULAR GOOD SONG CO-PENNED BY ROGER DALTREY HIMSELF( BALANCE OF WIRES).BUT THE LAST TWO SONGS SOUNDS ILL MIXED AND IS A SHAME BECAUSE THEY ARE GOOD SONGS TOO.THE CD IS GOOD BUT NO AS ""UNDER A RAGIN MOON"" OR ""ROCKS IN THE HEAD"".CHEEK OUT RUSS BALLARD...HE IS A GREAT SONG WRITER AND GUITAR PLAYER (EX-ARGENT).HE PRODUCED ROGER DALTREY S' ""RIDE A ROCK HORSE"" AND ALSO WROTE ""FREE ME"" FROM MC VICAR SOUNDTRACK."
2,Seams Ripped After 7 Months,"Maybe I'm being overly critical because we are on these cushions a lot and they did last 7 months, but the edge seams ripped open and now the cushions are unsightly. I hoped that the cushions were more durable."
2,Not good for students and beginners,"Despite of an appearance of being mathematically sound, Jagota's book is full of hand-waving and imprecision. The author jumps from one topic to another using unexplained terminology (particularly in examples.) I also don't trust the author's attitude of commenting on the well established statistical terminology in a way that can confuse and mislead the reader. One example of such misleading comments is implying the existence of ""symbolic random variable."" In fact the ""symbolic random variable"" IS a ""usual"" random variable, as it should. But it is a minor problem comparing to the overall lack of precision, missing background explanations and often inadequate references.In my judgement the book could be used by experienced bioinformaticians as a non-essential desk reference. Beginners and serious students should keep far away from it."
1,Not worth it if it was half the price.,"I bought the book for one of Dr. Jagota's classes at UCSC Extension and to say the least, I am very disappointed. The book is no more then an incomplete collection of his notes that he uses for one of his classes. There are very few complete examples and he uses terminology with out explanation, assuming the user knows everything about statistics and biology. This is not a good text for any one just starting out and I highly doubt it would be of much value to someone who is already in the field of Bioinformatics."
3,Get the right refill for your Bite Shield,I ordered a couple packs of refills for my Lentek Bite Shield from SmartHome and was unpleasantly surprised to get a completely different refill than the one shown on the Amazon website! I contacted the company and they sent me the proper refill at no additional cost after I returned the wrong refill to them via UPS. The actual refills work fine so there's nothing wrong with them (as long as you get the proper refill for your machine!). I rated this product lower because of the extra time I had to spend on the phone convincing the company that the item I received from them was entirely different than the photo on the Amazon website.
1,Say no to Akai. It will only work for a few days.,"I bought a Akai LCD TV 3 months ago. It is dead now. No sound and no picture. Their customer service was terrible, also. I will not ever buy this brand any more."
1,Don't waste your money,"This tv completely died in less than a year. First, it had trouble turning on. Then, it was completely dead, nothing works. Akai customer service is impossible to reach as well. Do not waste your money on this product."
4,Interesting early David Foster CD,While not as good as Rechordings (1991) it does have some good instrumental selections and features Lee Ritenour (whom Foster did a lot of work with throught the 70s and 80s) and Toto's David Paich among others.
4,Forest goes classic,"Fine arrangements - especially Winter Games with rythmic power, and Water Fountain with its poetic changes in melody."
5,Study Guide offers helpful insight,"Like the other study guides by Scott Hahn, The Gospel of Luke provides enriching insight and background to these sacred writings. These guides are ideal for discussion groups."
3,pretty good product,"This oil does help with insect bites, pimples, and healing scars. I had a pimple forming on my chin and applied the oil at least 2x a day. By the 3rd day it was cleared. The same with insect bites. The smell takes getting use to and u can feel a slight tingle when you apply to the skin. But I would purchase it again."
3,"Nice ""quick fix""","I bought this to see if it would be a cheaper alternative to the Joliese system. It is a nice ""quick fix"" It doesn't last as long as the Joliese system but I use this to touch up any areas that I might have missed or if I haven't had a chance to put the Joliese product on. It does wash off quicker and you have to be careful to keep a rag handy to dab at any areas that may have too much."
1,This really is one-day only color,"I've used tanning beds and many self-tanners over the years and am on a search for as close to ""perfect"" self-tanner as possible. Based on most of the reviews of this product I was looking forward to giving it a try, but the one or two people that said it would wash off after one day were correct. Total waste of $$ in my opinion, don't bother with it."
2,thought i was getting something else,"Drench used to sell a different product that came in a yellow can and I really liked it, it was called instant tanner. I thought they had just changed the packaging, wrong. The old stuff was a more yellow or ash tone. This new product is very orange or even redish. I used the old product to spray my feet when I wore sandles as funny as that sounds. My feet just don't tan as quickly as the rest of me. This new product stained any calloused areas orange that lingered way after the other areas had wore off after showering.( both knees and feet) My boy friend pointed at my feet and said what's that orange stuff. Ha! I guess I need to keep looking."
1,this pic is not what you get!!!!!,"First....this picture is not what you get. You get the old cans,which alarm me because if that's what they are selling,that's what should be pictured & also who actually knows how old the old cans actually are!!! Second...they make it seem like a great deal getting the spray can for $7.00, but in all actuality they charge you an obsene amount for shipping so just watch out for that. I ordered 1Can and my shipping $36.00!!!! So I cancelled my order asap because that just seemed like a scam to me. I order self tanners ALL the time, this one in particular, and NEVER have had an experience like this. I cancelled this one & ordered the same product (3 cans) for the same price the company was going to charge for 1 w/shipping!!!!"
2,different,I used to use this and loved it. looked dark and natural. Now i put it on and in one day it looks dirty. Am disappointed although the price was great($7.00 instead of $17.00 at Sallys)but will look for someting else
5,Well organized,The exterior box is a bit boring but the small puzzles are cute. On the back of each piece it has a shape on it. Easy to sort all the puzzle pieces plus there are dividers in the box to keep them separated.
1,Kept breaking - not safe,"I had to return this puzzle set even though my son (age 2 1/2) loved it. The pieces kept breaking apart with splintery wooden shards that were very unsafe. I glued the first few breaks back together but at least one piece broke every time we played with it! We used it only about 5 times. I returned it with no problem. I've had better luck with the ""Melissa & Doug"" puzzles sets like this one, unfortunately they don't have a ""Curious George"" set."
3,"Cute puzzles, but didn't last","These puzzles are cute, but after a few months the paper warped away from the wood and fell off, so we have a few pieces without pictures on them. Each one is from a book or TV show my son (age 2.5) could identify which made it even more exciting for him."
3,Just the minimum,I was not really impressed with these and returned them. They were difficult tio use and the viewing area was not that large. I have a pair of Busnell 10x42 and prefer them to this pair. The 20x50 is somewhat misleading and does not provide double the power.
5,Great,"These are great for nature watching. Everything is brought very up close, almost touchable. I would reccommend these to anyone."
2,Great product but. . . . .,"Well, the binocular was as stated in the product description, but it came with the prisms out of alignment, hence unusable. Sent them back in short order. Would have loved to keep them, but not the way they arrived."
4,Good product,"This item is great for the price, in fact I was pretty impressed by the lens and the zoom.Pros: great zoom, amazing clarity, and very receptive control. Had terrific experience at the Everglades national park with this.Cons: no strap, the covers are really flimsy."
1,used merchandise ?,"I was very disapointed after obtaining this binocular. I think, I obtained used merchandise. I is possible to see that the screw-bolt on focuser is squeezed and the rocker style focuser is easily jarred out of position. It is hard to normaly use the binocular. I do not restore the item, only because of much money for posting. It was my final shopping on Amazon."
3,Easy to use Binoculars??????,"I thought by taking the cap off and putting them up to the eyes, it would be easy to use. Neither myself or my wife could see out of them. It took quite a bit of adjusting to make the distance clear. Maybe there are better models. This is definitely not the case."
4,BINOCULARES bushnell 20x50,"LOS OBJETOS SE VEN BASTANTE CLAROS Y PRECISOS DE VERDAD VALE LA PENA SU PRECIO, EL UNICO DETALLE CON EL CUAL NO QUEDE CONFORME ES QUE ES FABRICADO EN CHINA Y LOS LOGOS QUE TRAE IMPRESO SE LE CAE LA PINTURA PIENSO QUE DEBE SER DE MEJOR CALIDAD ESTOS DETALLES PARA PODER REPRESENTAR UNA MARCA TAN IMPORTANTE COMO ESTA POR LO DEMAS ESTA ALTAMENTE RECOMENDADO YA QUE NO TODO LO QUE VIENE DE CHINA TIENE QUE SER MALO, EXISTEN MUCHAS COSAS QUE SON DE ALTA TECNOLOGIA Y CALIDAD."
3,Mine was bad as other reported,I really can't tell if the result of double vision is that while they deliver it it felt or just that quality control is poor i really don't know but mine as other reported already came with double vision problems. I heard someone saying its got to be with the alignment of the glass inside and that high power binocular are more difficult to get this alignment done properly but its a waste of my time thank god not of money that because a product is bad i have to spend time on buying this pair of binocular and then send them back. hopefully if you buy them they are good then I'm pretty sure it will be awesome because i like the power they offer and how much light come through the lens. Go ahead and try your luck hopefully even if they are good they last long.
4,Binoculars,"Product works as advertised. I didn't realize it, but the magnification is great enough that it is difficult to hold the image stable. This should be considered before you purchase. Sometimes stronger is not better. One of the dust cover caps was broken out of the box, but a call to Bushnell resulted in a new set being sent out immediately. Overall, a good buy for the money."
4,high power fi that's what you want,I read the reviews on this product and was a little reluctant to buy it beacuse people complained that they were too strong and difficult to hold when looking at a distance. If you want strong binoculars that's what will happen. These are fantastic at long distance and need a steady hand. If you want close distance you will need to get weaker ones.
4,Better than anticipated,"As a town agency inspecting possible development sites, I needed versatile, fairly rugged, yet budget priced binoculars. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. These Bushnells were built very rugged, were surprisingly clear and easy to use and offered a much better field of view than similar models we had used in the past.The carrying case could be beefed up a little more if, like me, you tend to toss them in the back of the SUV and head out into the field. The lens caps also were a little skimpy and easy to lose. But, for a good day-to-day field work unit, it offers both ruggedness and precision viewing. Easy to focus and the magnification is perfect when you are in locations that tend to be inaccessible and you need long-range viewing power. In that price range, the Bushnell 20x50 is more than worth the investment."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Do not buy these, they are good looking but flimsy junk. I should have known when when I opened the first pair (in the store) and noticed that one of the barrels was severely bent sideways. ""Bad batch"" I thought, and asked for another pair, which focused correctly, etc. Sometime in the next month they took a little banging somewhere, nothing major, but suddenly they were out of alignment. One of the plates that the front barrels mount on had just popped out, they are not even screwed on really, just pressed in or something. I sent them back to Bushnell but as they were out of warranty they wanted $56 to repair, I told them they could trash them. It will be a happy day when it will be too expensive for these big companies to make their junk in China and sell it here. Things may get more expensive to buy, but at least they will be local where they will have to up their standards or face the market consequences."
2,Hard to Focus Technology,"The strange focus adjustment lever is just plain difficult to use. The lever is uncomfortable to reach and adjust. It wasn't easy for me to adjust the focus easily or exactly. This made finding the perfect focus arduous and time-consuming.If you don't have a tripod, get one. You must use a tripod if you want to enjoy a long, steady, still gaze at your subjects.I'm buying a telescope next."
1,Cheap,No single view. Lenses are not aligned properly so you see two round views as opposed to one pic that you should see in a quality binoc.
3,It is okay,"It does not allow you to see in the dark, but it does the job. At least make things closer"
1,Broken Bushnell binoculars,The Bushnell Binocular arrived with one of the lens barrels broken off. I bought it to go on safari to Kenya and didn't have time to send it back to get an undamaged one so I tried to super glue the barrel in place. It didn't work because I suspect the alignment was wrong. The barrel was broken off at the point where it screws into the housing. The box was not damaged so the binoculars must have been packed broken and shipped.I will not buy another Bushnell product.
1,cannot focus,"These were a Christmas gift, so were past the 30 day Amazon return period when I found that they would not focus. Each idividual lins would focus, but the two together would not allign. Several different users have tried to allign the barrells without success. I have returned them to Bushnell, hopefully for replacement, but still had to pay postage and $10 for handling, notwithstanding the warranty."
3,Got what I expected,"Wasn't expecting too much since these were on the cheaper end. They work well for looking at the moon. The focus mechanism doesn't really allow for fine tuning, which leads to a difficult time getting the focus right."
3,Not great binoculars,I was expecting a better visual field for the binoculars. They are good but not great.
1,"Not the quality I expected, I sent it back!!","I returned this item as soon as I recieved it. I was difficult to focus, strap was worthless and the quality was poor. I ordered a Nikon 10x50 instead. The 20x50 was so strong that it was only good for very long distances and was very shaky and hard to focus at any distance. Do yourself a favor and just order the Nikon."
4,REVIEW OF BUSHNELL 20X50 BINOCULARS,PRODUCT IS AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED. LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY TO FOCUS. DOES REQUIRE A STEADY HAND OR BRACE.
4,Bushnell 20x50 Binoculars,"This is a great buy, much better than my Chinese binoculars. The optics are way better than expected. The only con so far is the weight, it is heavier than my old one so I have to try to rest it to focus properly."
1,Subpar,Very unhappy with product. Hard to focus and keep in focus. While viewing it will go out of focus easily
2,Not so good,"Looked forwad to getting these,but was very disappointed.There is a plastic string inside one of the lens that is in the field of view.Alignment must be off because cant adjust double vision out of them."
1,In focus...not quite,"These binoculars are not bad for the price. However beware that the focus adjustment takes time to get used to and lacks finesse.Also the eyes spacing adjustment must be made very carefully or you'll have a double vision.I thought these binoculars were made in America but they're Chinese...like everything else these days....After a few months usage, these binoculars turn out to be a lot disappointing. The construction quality is very poor, water vapour gets behind the lenses foging them from inside, upon closer examination one can see that the lenses have been screwed in very badly (cross with thread damages).These are only good as toys binoculars for 4-5 years old to play with.To be avoided."
4,Bushnell 20x50,For the price they are what I expected.I have a lot of property and enjoy watching the animals.They do a great job for this.
1,No brainer,Sent these back. They were out of alignment so everything was double vision. The field of view is very narrow making your subject difficult to find. Every time you move them you have to refocus and the focus mechanism had a no movement gap when changing directions. This was aggravating. I will be looking for an alternative.
4,Great product,We live in a roof top apartment and have a nice view of the city. Got these principally to be able to zoom in and see different details in the neighborhood and the city.We are binocular newbies - did not have any difficulties figuring out how to use them and are pleased with the purchase - we've had a lot of fun with these binoculars.
1,Just returned,"The vision was double! Could not correct, and the distance focus was dismal to boot! Impossible to get both lenses in sync and focused. And yes, I know about binoculars (30 years law enforcement, used ""a few"" times!) Very poor distance clarity. I returned (no problem thru Amazon) although my account still has not been credited. I ordered the 10X50 power which works great!UPDATE ON RETURN- Took a while (month) but I was credited fo the full amount including shipping, so we are square! Did buy the next lower power which work fine."
1,Bushnell PowerView 20x50 Binculars,"These binoculars were sent back for refund....I own a pair of bushnell 16x50 binoculars and they work just fine, but I wanted to get something that was a little stronger, so I purchased the 20x50 and after receiving them I was disappointed in them because they would not focus clearly. I followed the instructions on focussing, but they just would not focus well enough to see things clearly. There were parts that seemed to be loose and when using the focus rocker I could see the two lens wobbling. These were just poorly made. I have sent them back to Amazon for a refund."
5,Very Nice,I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law. They are very good quality and he is very please with them
4,Great binoculars...Lousy neck strap,Binoculars are wonderful. The neck strap is a piece of junk that doesn't even fit the binoculars. It is a piece of cheap plastic. Would have been 5 stars except for this neck strap.
3,Left lens blurry,"This an otherwise excellent binocular and I have the 16x50 version and am very happy. However, the one 20x50 that I received had a somewhat very bad case of blurry lens (for me at least,) but just the left one. So I returned it and got the full refund from Amazon, including shipping. It took some work to ship it back but it was really a simple and straightforward process, which makes me confident buying from Amazon again. I ended up buying the Pentax 20x60 which is excellent but not perfect. The most important thing for me is clarity (brightness) and sharpness (in both eyes, of course.) So, the build is important, durability and overall quality if very important, but the most important thing is getting a clear, sharp image. I believe this binocular can deliver but not my copy. I would like to try another copy but now I have the Pentax which so much better."
5,Great Binoculars,"For the money, these are great binoculars. Easy to focus and have great zoom. Only downside is the cheap plastic neck strap. I opted not to use it and tied on a nylon strap instead."
5,Awesome binoculars,I purchased these binoculars for my husband for Christmas this year and he absolutly loves them. The images are very clear and concise. I researched many different kinds before I decided on these. I would highly recommend these to anyone wanting an exceptional pair. He is looking forward to taking them into the woods to watch the birds and wildlife.
2,Not Good!,"These Binoculars are for the build quality totally overpriced! There are Binoculars you can get at Kmart or the Dollar Store for 15$ and compare to the Bushnell. Even so they are 20x magnification they don't even compare to my Binoculars from Nikon with 8x magnification. The optics are unclear and hinged in plastic!! The eye width adjustment is also very limited, which if you have a smaller eye distance creates a double vision. Which makes them useless. Order... have a laugh ... and send back!"
2,Not for serious use,I purchased these to observe eagles in my golf community in Florida. They do not have the ability to observe my subjects in any more than a casual way. If you are a serious nature lover and bird watcher stay away and upgrade. I am returning these and will be looking for better.
1,Bushnell Powerview difficult to adjust,"One of my eyes is far weaker than the other and I could not manage to adjust the binoculars so that I could focus them clearly. I kept seeing double unless I closed one of my eyes. My son did not have this problem with them so if your eyes are similarly strong/weak, then perhaps this product might work for you. I also found them to be quite heavy."
2,Bushnell 20x50 Binocular,"Got this yesterday 3/18/10. This binocular is so powerful do to it's 20x that it can not focus right. Everytime I try to focus on a item like a birds, mailbox car, and etc....I get double vision of the item on both eyes lens.. I called the shipper and return the binocular for a refund."
1,Bushnell 20X50,"I returned the Binoculars because they had double vision. These may have been manufactured incorrectly and could have been a 'one of a kind' but it would also suggest that Bushnell has ""quality check"" problems...lending suspect to the remaining products it manufactures."
2,bushnell 20x50,"I was not impressed with these binoculars, I have an ols Bushnell set 10x 50 that has much better optics??? Returned these. No hassles as usual from Amazon!"
3,Not as good as the other Core Fusion classes,"Maybe it's because I do yoga (and Core Fusion) all the time, but I thought this was very easy compared to the other Core Fusion classes. Towards the end, they did ""ab work"" that made me laugh compared to what they do in Body Sculpting, Pilates, and Abs and Arms. It did move quickly, but it also might bother people that it wasn't very peaceful and zen-like for a yoga class - dance music set the tone. I won't throw this one away, but I'll probably save it for days when I don't feel like doing some serious Core Fusion."
1,This is not Yoga,"This is not yoga. It is an aerobic fitness video using yoga poses. There is no proper breathing, relaxation/stretching exercises. It is also not for beginners. Very disappointed."
4,almost 5 stars!,"I really enjoy this video. I have done many yoga videos, and I like the pace of this video. It's not so slow, and meditative like others, but also not moves so advanced that I can't hold them. I like how it is broken up into 5 segments, it helps me stay focused and determined."
2,Nowhere near the intensity of the core fusion yoga classes,So I go toe core fusion pretty regularly ( yes its expensive and yes it is my biggest indulgence ).I purchased the dvd because i travel frequently and did not want to miss workouts in between (plus yoga + travel = feels great on the body)Yes it is a great beginner video - it works the hell out of you if you have never moved in your life before.I did the entire workout and it literally felt like a warm up - so many moves are repeated multiple times.I felt so underworked out that I popped in the jillian michaels dvd and worked my butt off for 30 mins to 'feel' like i worked out.The actual core fusion yoga classes (in person) are amazing - the exercise video just doesn't cut it.
3,Very hard workout,"For some reason, I expected this workout to be less intense than the other Core Fusion workouts. Boy was I wrong. I have problems with my balance and I was very frustrated because a lot of balance is needed in the workout. I recommend watching the DVD several times before attempting the workout as it is difficult to watch the DVD and do the workout at the same time. An awful lot of downward dogs! You definitely need to be fit in order to attempt this one!"
2,Wish the DVDs I got would actually play,"I am going back for my third DVD, only the first 10 minute segment will play, only the sounds will play on the other segments, no video. Very disappointing as the first segment was great! Look forward to getting a DVD that works. :("
1,Not suitable for portfolio work!,"I am a Graphic Design student graduating this Spring and I was hoping to get an inexpensive light weight portfolio and wound up with a piece of garbage. The cover is so flimsy it broke in the box during shipping. The insert pages(clear plastic) are obviously damaged with bubbles and wrinkles. Not so great for presentation. The black inserts are so thin I think a piece of construction paper would be more effective. I'm afraid to attach my work and still have it be good enough for review. It may work for something you can just throw your work in to keep it in one spot. But I don't feel it can handle me taking out of the house to show anyone, including potential employers, without it falling apart."
5,amazing movie,"Romanticised gypsy camp story, with amazing songs, it;s a must! The story develops in Cartpahians, between Hungary, Ukraine and Romania and it' a Romeo&Juliet; type drama, wonderfully written, directed and playedIt has been the most watched movie in the comunist block for many years. And for good reasons"
3,You get what you pay for!,The shower curtain works well with a quick shower. If you spend more than ten minutes in there it absorbs the water and makes the outer curtain wet. Two or three showers in a row makes the outer curtain so wet that it drips on the floor.
4,do wrap,"Price was kinda high [the reason for 4 stars] & material is thin, as is sweatband, but great for windy hikes; overall good item."
2,Grandma is just not the same...,"Too bad - There will never be another person who can do ""GRANDMA"" the way Dr. Elmo can! Nice try, Cledus! Dr. Elmo rules for Christmas novelty music."
2,Eh...okay...,"Every year we buy a few Christmas Comedy songs to even out the traditional ones...this is an okay collection of classic comedy christmas songs.Not a big fan of all of them, and most likely won't buy anymore of Judd's stuff...an aquired taste I seem to not be able to aquire!"
4,Very cute.,"Really cute. I actually got to use the bottle opener part on the first day I got it. It's a little bulky and fumbly when wrapping the headphones around the wraping part while as your key chain. I just leave the headphones in my purse and keep the shuffle on my key ring. Love it, overall!"
2,Did not fit,"It was just a tiny fraction too narrow. I did read the reviews, some said it fit right, some that it did not fit. I suppose it's just hit or miss on the sizing. It was very cute and would be great to keep up with the shuffle if it just fit."
1,Not a secure holder,The case failed to hold the iPod Shuffle secure allowing it to fall out unless I wrapped it in with the headphones. Nice concept but needs a snugger fit.
5,Mophie Shuffle Key Chain,"This is a great item. I bought one for myself and one for my daughter. We are both keeping our shuffles on the key chain and using it for the gym. We love being able to keep our gym card, car key and shuffle all on the same ring."
3,"Good customer service, bad picture.",Color of the Bevvy does not match my green Shuffle. Takes away from overall look of the device. Customer service offered to send another color but what's the point of that?
4,GOOD TIPS,Good introdcution to a subject which is almost always overlooked. The examples are interesting and you can apply to everyday life. A practical approach.
5,Miller Gets It!,"Working in a publishing company, the author, Kevin Miller surely knows about information overload. And his book proves he has figured out how to cope with it. What to save,skip, read or file are constant challenges in my small business world. This book gives me a framework and great tips. Practical stuff. Worth picking up--and saving!"
4,The Title Captures It!,"Practical hints that are immediately applicable. The book was written in 2004, so some of the technology references could use updating, but the concepts are good. Miller presents the information from a Christian orientation -- something that I believe should have been stated in the book description, so that prospective readers can make an informed choice."
5,"""Watkins calling!""","Is there nothing that William H. Macy can't do?! After buying the DVD movie of ""The Wool Cap"", in which he plays a mute worthy of an Oscar performance, I surged forward and got this movie of his right away. ""Door to Door"" is the true story of Bill Porter, an astounding man with cerebral palsy who aspires to be a door-to-door salesman for the Watkins company in Portland, Oregon. And he's still doing it! His optimism and determination will blow you away. You will forget that you are watching an amazing actor and believe you are watching the struggles of a real guy with C.P. Just a great feel-good movie!"
4,Door to Door....,Excellent movie.William H. Macy makes portrays Bill Porter to the tee. Very tender movie.
5,Brilliant and Inspiring,William H Macy is truly brilliant in this film. Bill Porter is an inspiration to us all. A very enjoyable and heartwarming story with lots of tears of joy and sadness.
5,DVD Movie Door to Door,Excellent movie. Awesome performance by William H. Macy. Terrific true story of how perserverence and hard work can lead anyone to achieve success despite any obstacles and prejudice life throws your way. Highly recommend it for the whole family.
4,High on Fire - Live and Powerful,"I was happy to see this live compilation appear. It's late in coming, but worth it. They have an energy that makes me always come back to this album and listen again and again."
5,First gig,"I was going to see Deke Leonard the Man band guitarist at Salford University's rec bar and the support act started tuning up. This little old man, I was about 22, wandered on wearing a black Crombie and a bowler hat. Duh! Aaarlow ! He said, then they kicked into one of the most unbelievable sets I have ever heard or seen. Budoom boom boom boom boom boom boommmm Sex and drugs and rock and roll budoom boom boom boom boom boom boommmm. My jaw dropped. NB&P; easily in the top five records ever made.Deke Leonard ? Can't remember anything about his set."
5,Great for a new Prepper,I read this even though I am not a mormon. It tells how to store food and how much to save and how you can easily treat your saved water. Be ready if there were to be a disaster. It discusses clothing etc and details on preparedness and much more.
4,A Collection of Stories for Preachers,"This is a small collection of brilliant stories, 101 of them classified under 4 categories.Short narratives are very valuable for preachers and teachers in bringing home the point and Fr Paul Wharton as a preacher and collector of stories knows it too well. He has done a service to humanity by bringing out this collection so that these anecdotes and stories are available at ready reference. Under 'Acknowledgements' he gives the sources where these stories originally appeared. I have found the book very useful."
3,good trance compilation,"Good compilation but if it weren't for the ""unexpected"" fade-out in some tracks, I would have given it 4 stars. Favorites are tracks 3, 5, 10, 11, and 14. Clear favorite is Airbase's euphoric remix of Flaming Clouds which made me ""float in the fiery sunset skies""."
2,Not what I expect,I did not like this book at all. I really thought this was going to be a really good mystery book but I was wrong. I do not recommend this book.
5,Memories of Reba,"This compilation of Reba's hits was serviced only to Canada, the UK and Australia, as a way to thank her fans in those areas for their support and dedication to her career. Its a nice collection of 20 hits of her career, and worth the price alone. This is the Canadian/UK version of the album, which features hits from the mid 80's to the mid 90's. Hits like ""For My Broken Heart"", ""Walk On"", ""And Still"", ""Rumor Has It"", ""Does He Love You"" (with Linda Davis), ""Is There Life Out There"", ""The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter"" and many other hits. A bonus is the songs ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""Misty Blue"". This is essential for fans of Reba, its one of the most concise collections out there of her hits. There are songs missing, but one day she will get around to including all her hits on albums. Give it a whirl."
4,A VERY HELPFUL BOOK WHICH DESERVES AN ENCORE,"I recieved this book second-hand and it was already a few years old but the information it contained was very helpful. At the time I was a teenager and I was struggling to create an image for my self. I was overweight and found it difficult put together a wardrobe for myself without spending a lot of money. This book helped me a lot. The tips that I learned from this book have helped me to this day and have also led me to a career in the fashion industry. Although the book was published in the 80's, the basic information is still current. Many current magazines (as well as books)have articles based on the same premise as this book. Lane Bryant should publish an updated edition."
2,Go find the old stuff first,"These 60s recordings of Son are sad compared to the originals from the 30s and early 40s, no comparison. Just compare the slow tempo and sloppy play on Preachin Blues here to what he did back on the original recording on Paramount. He burns on those old recordings. You have to get by the poor sound quality, but it is totally worth it. You won't ever know why he is so important and so deep until you hear those old recordings. When you do you will hear how much he influenced Robert Johnson and Muddy. He is the link between Charlie Patton and those guys."
1,dont bother,"this home movie is bad it has two good sections and when i say home movie that is exactly what i mean. it looks like it was filmed on a cell phoneit would be one thing if it cost 5 dollars but it dosent. If you like getting ripped off you will appreciate this home moviesincerly,a serious surf film enthusiest"
1,Amateur video,"This is a very disappointing video. I'll watch almost any surf video but I found this one simply unwatchable. It is basically a collection of someone's amateur video - filmed with an ordinary consumer video camera - of an assortment of various unremarkable surf contests in California, padded with a few surf sessions. If you ever wondered what you would get if you strung all of your random home surf video together and layered it with some lame surf music, this is it! The remarkable thing is that it it is published and for sale. The movie title and description suggest high-quality surf footage by someone with access to top surfers, and edited with an eye for making it artistic and soulful. Instead it is someone's home video (literally filmed from the Hunington Pier!) strung together at random with a cheesy soundtrack. I found much better footage of Joel Tudor on a certain video sharing website."
2,Monotone,"Very dissappointing film. There was an underlying monotone from the reverbed drenched guitars to film angles and editing. There is no narration and contrary to Jack Johnson films, the simplicity of this production just can not support such a dynamic technique. I am in fact a longboarder and when I am not in the water I at least enjoy a good film to take me there. This left me on the sofa, guitar in hand with the sound turned OFF! Generally I play with the soundtrack but this bored me to tears! Check out September Sessions even if you are a longboarder. Sorry, but I feel a bit taken."
2,Not what I thought it would be...,This movie was okay but I definitly thought it was going to be better..the music was boring and redundant and there were only a few chapters on the DVD that were interesting to watch..overall I was disappointed with this movie.
1,Don't waste your money or time,"I've watched a million movies. The quality of the filming was horrible. There were whole segments from Huntington filmed from the pier. Watchign a surf video from the top down is bad enough but did they have to catch the hand railing in the process, REPEATEDLY? The soundtrack was repetitious and boring. I would have to compare it to the first generation of short board videos featuring Machado and the likes. It looked like it was shot with a camcorder. One song scenes, like one of those high energy, punk rock surf videos. Crappy waves overall. No interviews or commentary. If you liked September Sessions, Single Fin Yellow, Longer or other high quality flick, this is as far from that as you can possibly get. Did I mention that I hated it? OH! There was a good part. A 2-3 minute section from the wedge. That was good. So if you need to spend alot of money for 2-3 minutes of fun, then this is your movie."
1,Ho hum,"lots and lots and LOTS of streaming video with the camera on the shore following any given surfer down the line. Big deal. No narration, no real comments from the surfers, no real reason to put this DVD on other than for a backdrop at a party. Shot on VIDEO, not film, this is an example of how not to make surf films. The filmmakers were lazy and overall it was an insult to longboarders. I am keeping this DVD only to add to the collection and poke fun at. Inexcusable."
3,Longboarding at it's best,"This is not so much of a movie as it is a collection of footage from different beaches and surfer. No commentaries, interviews or anything. Just a soundtrack and the waves rolling in, organized by breaks and/or themes. I don't find it too entertaining to sit and watch the whole thing but I'll stop to watch some sections (the Wedge footage is priceless, plus other cool breakes like Swami) and I'll also leave it on while busy with something else.For a longboard enthusiast it'll be great but if you're looking for an amusing Endless Summer knock-off this is not it."
5,Early Masters of Diatonic Harmonica,Some of it is a bit scratchy but nothing can mask this unique view into the laboratory of American music. Early experiments pushing the limits of the throw away instrument. DeFord Bailey is a powerful standout and inventor. His unaccompanied playing always sounds fresh and very un-oldtimey. It is ashamed more recordings don't exist of this legendary player.
3,Loved it!,I love his great guitar tone and very unique solo phrases. I'd prefer more instrumental songs and less vocal songs in his albums.
5,Must Buy,This is a must buy for anyone who studies the Civil Rights Era... get this book for your collection. Juan Williams did a fantastic job putting this book together.
1,Bad,This book was in very poor condition. Not what I expect. I will never purchase another book from this vendor.
3,Doesn't work well with firewalls,"Our IT group as well as another company's IT group has spent too much time trying to get this to work.I have been trying to help the individuals who are using this software and during my research and trials, I came across a FREE standards-based software Apple develops called Xmeeting. It's only for Macs, but if you have a Mac or can get one for this purpose, it may be well worth the hassle of dealing with Polycom or other VTC products who are not savvy with firewalls.The Xmeeting program ([...]) has a built-in software-based firewall transversal feature (using STUN). The video conference worked flawlessly the first time without any changes to the NAT (firewall) settings.Other solutions, like Polycom, should be this ""intelligent"". Kudos to Apple for providing a FREE solution!"
5,Funny and Chilling...,"Janeane Garofalo is so great in this role, as are all the other actors. I would definately recommend this movie. It has a few slow moments but it has a great plot and a wonderful cast that more than make up for them."
4,Surprise! It's Good!,"A dark comedy that starts off with a bang -- literally. The beginning is well-written, for it sets the pace for the rest of the movie. It pulls you in and makes you wonder what's going to happen next. A few minutes into the film, however, it starts to show traits of some pointless independent movie. Luckily, it picks up when Janeane Garofalo, the dry and sarcastic FBI agent, steps in. Joaquin Phoenix, whose brilliance as an actor is becoming more evident with every progressive film, turns in a commendable performance. Vince Vaughn provides great comic relief as your stereotypical, insane cowboy. The rest of the cast is also brilliant, however subtle their roles are. Although not perfect, this film has a way of staying with you, with its quirky and fun soundtrack, offbeat performances, fast-paced and intricately woven plot, and desolate country setting. Give this movie a try and you will be pleasantly surprised."
3,Stay Pigeons...,"I was not impressed with this movie. I found it predictable and the characters slightly annoying. A little too obvious when less really is more. I would recommend renting it, though it is hard to find."
4,Clay Pigeons,I thought this was a very funny dark comedy. Joaquin Phoenix was great in this part and Vince Vaughn was a hilarious psychotic killer. His laugh was both unexpected and fitting for his character. Definitely recommend this video.
5,Clay Pigeons,"I liked this movie! This was the first movie I saw Joaquin Phoenix in and without him the movie would not have been a success. He was perfect for this role. THis is the second movie I saw Vince Vaughn in other than Psycho. He played a perfect manipulating psycho path and truly makes the film. Vince, Joaquin and Janeane Garofalo have perfect chemistry for this movie! I also liked the way the movie was directed. Very entertaining and a keeper for my movie collection."
4,:--),"This movie ROCKS! The music is great, and so are the actors! It's fun, just don't let the kids watch it!"
3,"Bloody and disturbing film, with light moments of humor",Janeanne Garofalo is barely given airtime in this movie about a psycho serialkiller and a well-meaning but bumbling fool who ends up taking the rap. The one brief scene that is this films saving grace is of Garofalo and a vibrating bed.
3,OK nothing great,"Premise kinda like Strangers on a Train (loosely). I was disappointed...had very high expectations. Vince Vaughn is good, but...I'm really tired of these independent movies that use urban/rural poor folks in amoral violent tales...where murders are presented as entertainment in a detached manner. This seems to be fashionable now. Now I want to see a movie about NYC East Village pretentious filmakers (with masters from NYU) who, by behaving like idiots, become hopelessly enmeshed in a moral quandry that places them in danger. Something Resevoir Dogs like, where they all kill each other in the end. Girls, watch this movie for a scene where Vaugn is wearing nothing except tight underwear."
3,Vince Vaughn fans must see,"The plot is a little iffy, but this is worth watching just to see Vince Vaughn in action. He is at his best with his hilarious and witty portrayal of a truck drivin, hillbilly, ladies man serial killer."
3,Great Cowboy Clothing,"Although the main character hardly lives his life ""in the cowboy way"" he is a snappy dresser in his fine collection of highly embroidered cowboy shirts reminicient of Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and Tom Mix. Many of the shirts were made by H BAR C - California Ranchwear and are still available in western stores today."
2,When Joaquin was the lesser of two Phoenixes,"Maybe I was smoking something when commercials for this flick first came out, but I thought it was marketed as a comedy. This is not a comedy. Unless you want to call it a ""black comedy"" which basically means violence and murder and sex for no reason is funny or absurd. I didn't like this movie at all. None of the characters are likable and the story is unbelievable. This isn't a sleeper, a cult movie, or an art movie. Its just a bad movie. If you want to see an ""exploration of violence"" type movie, go watch Kalifornia instead. You have been warned."
5,Pretty Darn Good....,I picked this movie up at the rental store because all the new releases that I wanted were out. I had not heard any reviews or any of the hype. I basically liked the fact that Vince Vaughn was in it. I was really impressed! What charm that guy has! He seems to have a talent that allows him to pull off any type of character. The movie started off by getting you very interested and involved...and it never stopped. This movie is great entertainment!
4,How did I miss this one?,"I'm surprised I haven't heard more about this one. It hung in the la la land of my queue for years until I finally just got around to watching it. This is yet another underrated movie that somehow just kind of got lost in the mix... after watching it I seriously wondered how this one wasn't much more popular; it has the feeling of a serious cult classic.The whole thing has this really campy and energetic feeling to it... the story is nothing too special but it's told in a way that makes it pretty fun to watch. But what really made this movie for me were the characters... Vince Vaughn was great in this! Seeing this makes me wish he would do more experimental roles instead of being the romantic comedy go to guy that he is now. I definitely recommend this one, I'd bet a pretty penny that most people will get a kick out of it. 4/5 stars."
4,Great performances...,"I thought the cast was pretty much perfect and their performances were great. I just didn't think the story was very orginal and it was too easy to guess what was going to happen next.Still, I enjoyed it and would recommend it, although it was really nothing special or exciting."
2,wrong artist description,"disappointed , the songs of the cd is not sung by lyn paul and it was a rock band. wrong description of the artist ."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzz,"I have to say that this was a bit of a snooze. I found the characters to be very dry and 2 dimensional. I was even skimming towards the end hoping for something interesting to happen. It didn't. There are better ways to spend your money. (coffee, chewing gum, a good pen....)"
1,Ick.,I couldn't finish it. Edwina was dry and boring; I could not get a grasp on her motivation for being so standoffish when she had dreamed of this man for years. Her old-fashioned attitudes bored me witless and the dialogue between her and Klaus felt flat. I ended up skipping/skimming 50 pages at a time to see if anything interesting happened. It didn't.
1,i hate it,My husband loves this vaccum but I hate it. It is very noisy and has very little suction. At first i thought maybe the removeable dust buster would work well for the car or boat but It's suction is not powerful enough. Ok to suck up dog hair. i would not recomend this product.
2,Not Good for hard floors,"This vacuum is worthless for picking up small particles of dirt or rock (sand like) when being used as a floor vacuum. With the beater bar off, it doesn't pick them up, it just pushes them around. With it on it just throws them out from behind the vacuum. The suction is not great enough to pick them up when it is spread out across the length of the vacuum head.On carpets and as a handheld dustbuster, it does a nice job. Do not purchase if you are planing to use it on hard surfaces."
4,Great Lil' vac,"I purchased 3 of these for x-mas presents, 1 was for myself. I bought this brand because my friend has had a cordless B&D vac for 3 years and really abuses it(and it still works!) I have a sheltie and it picks up the surface (only) hair on the rugs and every thing on the vinyl floor. It literally picked up pieces of a plastic fork and corner piece of a juice box(with the beater brush on). It definitely is not a primary type vac if you have lots of carpet, but every time I empty the cup it is full of hair,sand, crumbs and dust. One thing about it is that the switch for the beater brush to turn off & on is kinda finicky, so sometimes when you think it's on, it isn't (which would cause you to think it doesn't have suction!) If I would have paid $75. I still would have been satisfied!"
3,Average,"This is a good light-duty vacuum. Convenience is the best feature. Being cordless, it can be used anywhere, and it's very lightweight"
4,Perfect vacuum for stairs,"I've been looking for a good vacuum for stairs and high traffic areas that always could use a quick clean-up. This isn't what you'd want to vacuum the whole house, but it's great for doing the jobs where you don't want to haul out the big vac, or carry the big vac up and down the stairs. I didn't find it to be as great on hard floors, but it worked well on carpeted ones. My biggest complaint about this vacuum is the on button of course is on the dust buster portion, so you have to bend down to get to the power button, where it's normally right on a handle. Other than that, I really think this vacuum is great for what I bought it for."
2,totally displeased,"This cordless vacuum was absolutely useless. It has no suction whatever and doesn't even pick up the smallest amount of cat hair, dust, or paper. I am truly diappointed as Black & Decker products have always been quite reliable.I have since returned it and am trying to find an alternative."
3,Cordless Vacuum,"After a very few minutes of the first use of the cordless vacuum it quit. I suspected the battery contacts might be insecure, adjusted them and operation resumed. This is a typical problem for Black & Decker cordless appliances, so I tried that first. The vacuum works well--picks up dog hair and other bits of debris. The battery pack often loses contact but wacking the case on the side reseats the connecion. Endurance of the charge is good, but emptying the dust cup requires removing the hand-held part from the floor unit to get to the cup--and the catch holding the hand-held unit in the floor unit is flaky. All in all, the vacuum is satisfactorily useful."
1,Vacuum didn't work!,"I've had this vacuum for 5 months now and for 2 of those months it's been in the repair shop. It would have been in the shop longer if I had time to take it in earlier. I think they're waiting for a part from Black and Decker that's never coming. After 4 or 5 light uses, the battery just stopped charging. So I can't tell you how it works, because it doesn't. I'd save my money and go buy a corded stick vacuum and forget about cordless for now."
5,vaccum diva1,one of the handiest little gadgets for the home.you still need a prpoer vaccum but this is just great when you cant be bothered to lug out the vaccum!I have 3 of them around the house as I have dogs and the hairs are everywhere.the dustbuster by itself seems to have more suction than thr vaccum part but its still good. definitely recommend.
4,pleased,"does what it is made to do. quick little clean-ups nothing major. has good power for dog hair, crumbs, and loose dirt. very pleased with it and would buy again."
3,needs more battery power,"While it is a decent mini-vacuum, having a beater bar on it really helps. However, it really could use some more battery power though- only runs with the beater bar on for about 10 minutes before doing dead."
3,Returned item,Flunked the kitty litter on hardwood floor test.Its brush scattered dirt on hard surfaces. OK on carpet.
2,"Great for a few months, but not longer...","We bought this about six months ago as the primary vacuum in our very small 1 bedroom apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting. It was wonderful for the first few months, the cordless option was great and it worked fairly well on the carpet (it's no dyson, but it picked up most of the visible stuff). However, it hasn't held up very well. Even after cleaning the filter and pulling all the hair out of the beater bar, it has almost no suction. It tends to collect crap inside the mouth, and then either spit it back out behind, or drop it out as soon as you turn it off. It is also made out of cheap plastic, and part of it keeps falling off and has to be snapped back on almost every time we use it. It's probably fine as a secondary vacuum that dosen't get a lot of heavy use, but if you're looking for a primary vaccum, even for a small apartment, this one won't last long."
3,Cordless vacuum,"The main problem with this vacuum is the weak suction and old-type of battery. It still uses the old Ni-Cad battery which not only holds less charge but has a memory and does not last as long as the newer batteries.To maintain any decent suction you have to empty the canister frequently. I got this for picking up scattered litter from the cat-litter boxes and it's just marginal at that. The main plus is the light weight, but don't expect it to do the job a plug-in vacuum cleaner.As an addendum after having this vacuum for almost 3 years: to maintain suction you not only have to empty the canister, but have to clean and change the filter frequently."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this product after reading the other reviews on the great performance and suction of the unit.I am very disappointed with it. I wanted a cordless vac to use on my vinyl kitchen floor for quick pick-ups in between real cleanings.This unit as a hard floor vac is horrible. It barely has any suction and hardly picks up anything - picks up dust, but nothing more - crumbs, etc all stay on the floor. I performed my unscientific test of holding a single square of toilet paper in front of the vac and there is absolutely no suction.As a hand held vac removed from its ""handle"" and without the brush roll it does fine. Unfortunately, I already have a handheld vac and did not want another. Seems to me that the handheld vac is fine, but the design of the handle assembly ruins its suction and its abilities. Its useless for me then."
3,"Decent, not awesome.","We bought it to clean our boat. It does an OK job. I would've liked a bit more power, I suppose. But for the price, it's not a bad vacuum."
5,Great present,"This vacuum was a gift from me to my daughter. Just recently she told me that it was just what she wanted. The little seperated dust buster was so handy to pickup small spills, etc."
4,satisified CFV1200 user,"We are very satisified with the CFV1200's power, flexibility, design and overall performance. We have had other brands before but this one is much more powerul and with the three different tools built in one model it is much eaiser to use around the entire house, floors, rugs, stairs and furniture. It is light weight but yet powerful and sturdy enough to do a great job and not be too much to handle."
4,4.75 Starts - Great book in Next Series,"I have really enjoyed the Next Series from Harlequin because they are not romance novels, but stories about women. Many are very interesting and hit home. I have really enjoyed watching for the 4 every month, though I haven't read them all. This book was just a nice story about a 40-something year old woman who is getting married and her family trials! Something I could relate to (the family part anyway)! I'd recommend this book over others in the Next Series, though for the most part, buying something from this series is usually a good bet!"
5,This Is Not The OFFICIAL Release,"Islam: What the West Needs to Know(This is a link to the AUTHORIZED version). The authorized directors' version is the one with the black and red cover released on July 17, 2007 (pre-orders being taken now). Amazon has it, you just got to an old page from when the film was pre-released in a small batch by the producers. Those copies are all long gone so anyone selling this version is selling bootlegged or used copies."
5,Should be compulsory viewing,"Its an obligation of infidels to spread the word of this amazing documentary ,Just like waging war is an obligation on muslims. Most people are cognizant of the threat of Islam on some level or another , This film brings in all into a disturbing resolve and tells you, if you are paying attention what is on the horizon ,Do not doubt Washington and London will burn, when you see the lies your leaders utter, you will shrug your shoulders and say,"" The sooner the better"""
5,Facts and Fiction about Islam...,"This film is by far the most interesting presentation of Islam that I have yet to see. I recommend viewers be fully awake before attempting to watch it, as some amount of concentration is required to reap the full benefits of this documentary. Packed with direct quotes from the Koran and other reliable sources, along with compelling visuals and tasteful interviews, it will challenge even the experts. Is violence built into the Moslem ideology? ""Islam: What the West Needs to Know"" addresses this question and I believe answers it. Even my 14-year son enjoyed the film ""for its shock value,"" as he put it."
1,Stipulations and false presentation.,The comments made by the publishers and others are based on stipulations and ignorance. Islam has been presented the way they want to present. Their views are based on deep seated prejudices and hate for Islam and its messenger prophet Mohammed. They try to twist the faith of Islam the way Christianity faith has been twisted by the pope and other bible authors. They have been trying to discredit Islam because they see a great value in Islamic faith. The proof is in the statics that three out of four who read Quran accept Islam.Dr. Saleem Ahmed
1,Why watch DVD's to learn about Islam ?,Why dont you read the Quran and see for yourself what's written in it? Dont take someone else's word for it. Ask yourself ... how come it is the fastest growing religion in the world ... especially if it is such a bad religion?
4,Peaceful Religion?,There are many peaceful Muslims but the religion is not peaceful. Islam in its radical form seeks world domination through violence if necessary. World peace will be achieved after Islam dominates and non-Muslims are subjugated to second-class status (dhimmis). This is what I learned after viewing this DVD. I would like to see wide spread viewing of this DVD through the Western world.
2,Unintentionally evil,"Traudi Junge never mentioned to anybody what she did during the Second World War. But the guilt wouldn't go away. That's because, as a 22-year-old woman, she was one of Hitler's personal secretaries, trusted to the point that it was she who typed up his last will and testament in the Berlin bunker. Documentary filmmaker Othmar Schmiderer and conceptual artist Andr Heller convinced Junge to tell her story and their film is as simple as it comes: Junge talking straight to camera, attempting to explain what she did and why. There are also snatches of Junge watching herself on film, commenting further on what she has said. A film that shows it is not just evil itself, but the ignorance of evil that can be equally destructive."
5,Monster's Ball,"The most dramatic, and realistic depiction of the monster and his cohorts of WWII, and their last days; and the inability of us to not see further than our own expectations, or not see them at all. Be ready to view this one, then, you'll want to see it again and again, even though you already know the ending."
3,"Misleading Description, She WAS Interviewed In The 1970's.","Just to set the record straight and I'm sure many of you know this, she was interviewed first by the BBC/Thames for the documentary ""The World At War"" which was made around 1974! I just wanted to point that out since the description says she was quiet until just a couple of years ago which would make it around 2003, thats inaccurate. I think once you have seen her in The World At War interview and seen the movie Downfall, we know where she is coming from. I would not waste my time on seeing anymore of this Hitler admirer. Her descriptions of Hitler in the bunker are totally different then Speer's account in his autobiography, I am sure Adolf could be different things to different people and I think the person Speer's recounts was the real Hitler."
4,Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary,"A good documentary for anyone interested in WWII. To have someone within the inner circle not associated with the Nazi's for political reasons gives another perspective. You almost forget that she is speaking about Hitler sometimes and then you remember...Oh she's talking about Hitler!The documentary is basic and the audio is sub-par, but worth the watch."
3,Excellent Primary Source Material,"If I was much more intensely interested in the subject, I think that this would be a more interesting film to me. This is basically 60 minutes of very cogent, if repetitive, autobiography and recollections of an elderly woman who was in Hitler's steno pool. She says basically the same things I have heard from other folks her age - she was young, naive, insulated and just didn't think too hard about what was going on around her. She feels remorse and guilt.She does not seem unrehearsed -- so, I'm sure she's talked with friends over the years about the subject. The film is all just of the subject speaking into the camera with little if any off camera commentary, questions or prompting. No additional footage or narrative is included. Great primary source material for a high schooler writing a paper or for a die hard WWII history buff."
4,"Just good, solid, music","My husband first rented this movie not long after it came out. I love gospel music as it is so when I saw the movie, I knew I had to get this cd. Not really a bad song on the set...although I'm not crazy about the Joanne Rosario song. Regardless, well worth the money, especially listening to Tamyra Gray singing ""Now Behold the Lamb""."
3,Songs left out are the ones I love!,"Why include the secular hit ""The Closer I Get To You"" (even though it's a great song) and not put on ""Seasons Change"" which was a beautiful song sung by Tamyra Grey??Someone told me there are 2 versions of this soundtrack; but I have yet to find them; or my beloved song."
3,Okay..okay,"I liked the movie... i guess since it was this producers first movie, I should say that it was okay. The soundtrack is okay. My favorite song is "" Glorious"" and of course Yolanda Adams, "" Victory""."
3,Joyous,"I haven't heard the soundtrack but I sew the movie and while sitting in the movie theater I texted my husband and asked him to search online and see if there was a soundtrack for the movie. Although some of the songs are remakes, it still was a good movie with uplifting music. All these songs on one CD will be an awesome investement. I love it when I don't have to continously change CDs because I only like one or two songs on the CD. If you are a true gospel music you will definitely appreciate this project."
4,Unfinished Business,"The book was pretty good! Not my favorite book, but I did like the story line. I just though the reading level was slightly lower than I'm used to!"
3,Unfinished business,Didn't realize I had read this his until I was well into it ..finished it anyway .Another great Nora Roberts
3,unfinished business,Typical Nora Roberts - the sorry was entertaining but predictable from the beginning. I chose the book and would not say others should not
2,Strictly romance,I checked this book out of the library. I didn't know it was a romance novel until I checked it out but since it was free I figured why not. I had read other Nora Roberts books and enjoyed them. This was another formula romance novel with anemic characters. Twenty-eight year old concert pianist returns to hometown 12 years after leaving her high school bad boy boyfriend. The bad boy is now the town doctor and still hot. Surprised? Not. The writing style was annoying as the author switched the narration among characters indiscriminately throughout the book sometimes twice on one page. Not bad for light reading.
3,Boring,"Though I guess the writing style was good, the story was just so dull I wouldn't have finished reading it had I not paid for it."
4,Very Nice,"As always Nora Roberts does not dissappoint you, this is a light reading that makes you enjoy your timetime well spent reading it"
4,memory lane,"I got to about 10 pages into this book and realised i had read it, due to the fact it was a Nora Roberts book I decided to give it another go (also remembered enjoying reading it the first time). I got so much out of the re-read including recognising the reference to Princess Gabriella which had me running to my bookshelf to check if i was right. Brilliant book, well written."
2,"meh - awkward language, predictable story arc","I expect better from Nora Roberts. Not enough character development in this one, and I found the storyline incredibly predictable. I got this for 2.99, but it wasn't even worth that. i forgot what this story was about almost as soon as i finished it."
4,Enjoyable story,"I enjoyed Unfinished Business. It did seem a little weird how Vanessa's beau was her best friend's brother, and her Mum's new husband's son etc, but once I got over this I enjoyed reading about Vanessa and Brady and it was a nice easy read. I'm a sucker for a good ending so this one hit the spot for me. A nice quick romance."
2,This was not so good...,"I rarely write reviews, but I was compelled to express my disappointment with this story. Nora Roberts usually has creative plot lines and the romance is nice...but this was uncomfortable and ridiculous. There was little reader connection with the characters and the relationships between everyone was sprinkled with over-dramatics or too quick resolution to deep issues. I finished this book the way you pull off a bandage: Quick and fast...just to get it over with.Very glad it was free. It was worth the price, but not the time."
3,Unfinished Business by Nora Roberts,"An easy to read romance, which I read on my Kindle. The story flowed well and you knew it would have a happy ending!"
5,goooood,really good book. loved it. best book ive read besides the hunger games!! recommened for girls not guys. couldnt put it down
4,LOVE NROBERTS,"Just when I thought I had read all of NRoberts books, I read Unfinished Business and realized I had not read this one ...Yes! Unfortunantly, with Kindle it is hard to tell if a book you're interested in is a reprint. I have purchased books on my Kindle that I had read before. I've learned to take a little extra time to check the author's website and publishing dates before purchasing. Unfinished Business was a good read, a real page turner. No regrets about this purchase."
4,Unfinished Business,I enjoyed the book and the price I paid for the book was very reasonable. I look forward to ordering more books from Amazon.
2,2 to 2.5 stars *read like an older book*,"I've never read a Nora Roberts book, but I've been wanting to. The Nora Roberts books for kindle are usually out of my price range, (I won't pay over $10 for a kindle book), so I thought I would give this one a shot. It reads like an older book, maybe late 80's or early 90's, so it was hard for me to get into the characters. Some of the other reviews said that this was a re-print, so maybe it is 10 or 20 years old. The whole storyline of Van still being a virgin after being such a jetsetter, not believable. Brady wasn't that great of a H and I didn't think Van was a great h either. There really wasn't any chemistry between them, it seemed forced."
4,Holly,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan, so of course I loved this book. I just wish the book was longer. I don't think there has been a Nora Roberts book I haven't liked."
3,Unfinished Business,"If you like Nora Robers you will like this e-book. It's short enough to finish easily on an e-reader, but long enough to create a story line. Keeps you interested. Nora's typical romance and great insights into the characters thoughts and feeling. Great quick read."
3,Good Book,"This is the first book I downloaded for my new Kindle Fire. I love Nora Roberts, this book was a short one and wasn't her best but was good and very easy reading."
4,"Unfinished Business, Nora Roberts","Enjoyable, easy read, love the way Nora Roberts writes. She doesn't leave you hanging at the end. Looking forward to another novel of hers."
4,lulu,if you are a Nora Roberts fan you will enjoy another of her wonderful love story!Very light and enjoyeable reading.
3,GOOD READING!,"Nice book, in line with what was expected from a Nora Roberts novel. Good pace and interesting characters made this book nice to read."
4,Easy Read,The book developed and provided for growth of infomration and building of the characters. To me there was no true climax of the book but it was enjoyable and easy to read.
5,The characters are very believable and written well,I enjoyed reading this book you cared about the characters and felt like you got to know them
4,Unfinished business,ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK. ANYTIME I CAN READ A BOOK AND LOSE MYSELF IN IT I ALWAYS CONSIDER IT AN AWESOME BOOK
5,Great story!,Lovely story of a woman who is trying to find herself and finds it with her first love of her life!
3,Quick read,The book was enjoyable and moved at a fast pace. It's not my favorite by Nora Roberts but it was definitely a good read.
4,Love Nora Roberts,This book was so heart warming and uplifting. I find such comfort in a good Nora Roberts read. This didn't disappoint. I would recommend for sure.
4,Great Read,"I have always loved Nora Roberts. She never disappoints me with her books. Through all the different storylines, I can count on her to deliver."
1,meh,nothing really special about this book. did not care for the main character. she was weak and unlikeable due to the circumstances of her childhood. just think there should have been more meat to the story
2,Really...,"I'm a Nora Roberts avid reader but this one left me very disappointed. Really think if was my first read of Ms. Roberts it would also have been my last. Thankfully, have read some of her great works and am just counting this as an oops on her part!"
3,Unfinished Business got finished.,Very interesting and touching. Once I started reading couldn't put it down till I completed reading. Love all Nora Jones books.
5,Nora Roberts can't be beat.,first book I read by Nora made me cry. I had to read all of her books from then on.
5,Unfinished Business,Great story. I was pulled in right from the start. One of those stories that stays with you and leaves you feeling good.
5,Hard to put down,"Well paced, and engages you right away. Nora Roberts does it again. I found I wanted to keep reading this book more than get that extra hour of sleep before work."
4,Enjoyable light reading,"A cute story about a classical pianist who left home as a teenager to pursue her career under the overbearingly high-pressure of her father/tutor/manager. Now, 8 years later, after the death of her father, she decides to return home to Western Maryland to rest and recover from an ulcer and severe burn-out, and to reconcile with her mother and childhood sweetheart. From her new adult prospective, and out from under the misguided influence of her father, she realizes that the misunderstandings that to her estrangement from both of them wasn't what she had been lead to believe. A nicely presented story about repairing mother-daughter bonds that seemed damaged forever, and about reconnecting with one's soulmate."
3,Too simple and easy read,I am usually a big fan of Nora Roberts. The book was took easy to read. I figured out the story and how it was going to end by the time I was only a quarter the way through the store. I was rather disappointed.
3,"Usual good,easy read from Roberts.","Girl finds man, girl goes away. Girl realizes what she left behind. Girl comes back and- like the fairy.tale says, “lives happily ever after,“!"
3,A good pool-side read,"""Unfinished business"" will not change your life or make you fall in love with its characters but you will enjoy the story and spend 4+ hours enjoying yourself."
3,Lovely romance,"A brief book, well written, and an easy read. I found that the book ended so quickly that I was left wanting more, but thoroughly enjoyed the read."
3,Quick read.,"Reads like early Nora Roberts. Classic love story/coming home theme. Really not much else to say about this book, just have to meet the word requirement."
3,not her best...or worst,A little less detailed than i am used to with Nora Roberts. Not terrible but she has definitely written better!
3,Serious book,"I was hoping for something a little more upbeat. This book had a heavy feeling to it, but very romantic."
3,I love this author,"The first story I'd read of hers was of time travel! I was hooked, needless to say. She was recommended by another avid reader, and this was not my normal genre at all. I thought it might be just another love story like every other love story I've read, but this author changes it up often. This story was a coming about story of young love who reunite after they've grown up. Very touching, and this author always gets my blood boiling in each of her stories. ;p"
4,Nora Roberts --Unfinished Business,"I really like a story about a ""Who Dunit"" type of story. I am going to get the series.Unfinished Business (SIM 433)"
5,Love Silly Songs,"I bought this as a cart filler but it has been the best thing I have ever purchased. My granddaughter was starting preschool and was not overly thrilled about attending. Every morning on the way to school, we played silly songs and she quickly learned every word. She was in the best mood by the time we arrived at preschool that she forgot to be sad. We still sing the songs every day."
5,Writing Home,Writing Home is a great book to read! Cindy writes about everyday activities very well and entertaining. My Kindle Fire displays it very well for reading purposes.
3,Writing Home is a winner,"Writing Home by Cindy LaFerle is a wonderful book filled with short stories of everyday life. Cindy can take an ordinary event (shopping, meeting friends, gardening) and tell about it from a unique point of view. I love reading about the way she looks at everyday things. It makes you reflect and realize that everyday things are not to be taken for granted. My 15 year old daughter picked up Writing Home and started reading some of the stories. I heard her laugh out loud as she related to the funny tales that only Cindy LaFerle can spin."
2,So-So,"I found this collection of newspaper articles rather bland. The writing is so-so and the topics don't excite me. I could see that others might find them interesting and easy to grasp because the writing is simple and about commonplace things, but I like writing that is more challenging and subtle."
3,"I heard so much about the success of this album, but...","...all save one of these songs are already on another Andrea Bocelli CD, ""Romanza."" That's the one to get. `Nuff said."
2,Frustrating,"This is better than nothing... but it is a frustrating book.It is extremely difficult to find the information you want. First, the book includes many models of Virago, which are all different. You will find yourself thumbing through pages and pages of not relevant material, and the entire second half is only about the 500 cc bikes. Second, the table of contents is not detailed and the index is almost non-existent. Finding a specific topic *always* takes good round of searching.Instructions will say things like ""Step 1. See section 3 for how to do XX."" (Then spend 10 min combing through section 3 to find something relevant.) ""Step 2. See section 4 to remove AA."" (Now spend another 10 minutes searching section 4.) References in the text never include page numbers.I'll be checking out the competition."
1,Won't play on a computer!,"I love Bond...the classical meets techno is amazing!When I saw they had a dual disc greatest hits CD, I knew I had to have it. However, this CD is useless to me. The copyright protection on the disc is such that not only can you not rip the CD to your hard drive or an MP3 player, you can't even play it at all on a computer.Now I'm stuck with a CD I can't return because the packaging is open. I don't own a boom box (...who does anymore?), so essentially this a greatest hits coaster.Save your money and buy the tracks you like from a legal MP3 source and make your own greatest hits CD."
3,Fun Compilation But Should've Been Better.,"Hot looking chick string quartet rockin' the classics and classifying the rock. If you're expecting Emerson, Lake and Palmer - forget it! Bond are just plain fun. They add some rock, techno, dance and world beats...and voila! Too bad this isn't that good of a compilation. If I were to pick the songs for a Bond greatest hits album, it would not be this. Only 12 songs? Buy the original individual CDs and make your own ""best of"" instead. By the way, if you like Bond, try out Vanessa Mae - she's even better."
2,"""Best Of"" for a band with few titles and less than 10 years?","I absolutely love this band, but I really think it is lame that they allowed a CD to be created titled ""Best Of ....""! That shows how greedy they or their marketers are to sell CDs. The band should seek to tour more often if they want to get their name out. I just get irked that they chose to make this mistake. The music on this CD it top notch, but they don't deserve to have a ""Best Of"" title anytime soon, and neither does Britney Spears!Buy the CD if you don't have any of their music. Don't buy the CD if you do. Its that simple in my opinion."
4,Fantastic CD!,"I discovered Bond when I was in Atlantic City last year and they happened to be playing near my in-laws' place. I had read about them in a local paper and wanted to check out the music. About 10 minutes into the show, I was hooked! Their music is fantastic and they have tremendous stage presence.This CD, Explosive, is a great representation of their hits and has a few new tracks. In addition, the DVD side is a fabulous bonus!Please keep making your beautiful music and entertaining us with your shows!"
1,Horrible sound.,"I love this group but this disc is not what they say it is---it is not really 5.1 sound. The inside notes say there is some sort of automatic 5.1 converter they used. This album was never remixed into 5.1 properly but just run through some 5.1 generator that makes 5.1 out of stereo recordings...lame. I listened to it at home and was very dissappointed.Just to make it clear, I am a big fan of their music and I recommend it, but the included dvd is sub-par. The regular cd also included is great. Seeing as how I bought it just for the 5.1 dvd, I felt very, very unsatisfied."
1,Stay away at all costs!,"Horrible, horrible tripe that gives classical music, string quartets, and beautiful women a bad name. The music is shrill, cheesy, ""ethnic"" techno with some strings thrown on top. These women have allowed record company men to put their talents to use for evil."
5,You need to take a listen !!!!,I am a big classical music fan. Although this runs more neo-classic it is still some fabulous stuff.These 4 gorgeous ladies are a great pleasure to watch performing. Their talent is enormous.A great CD.
3,Pretty good,Really only liked the first 4 or5 tracks. The Shine CD is far better. This seemed like it was much more of a copy of someone elses style-like Bond hadn't yet decided on a symphony backup...
1,Not even on the same PLANET as David Garrett,"This group showed up as a recommendation for me because I bought (and love) David Garrett's work. I took the bait, and have wasted my time and money. This is m...i...l..e...s away from Garrett. Just junk music. Sounds as if somebody just added violin tracks to studio music. I would never buy this again and would prefer a refund."
5,Great book,Excellent book! I have read a few by Mr Stowers and wondered if he actually wrote them..they were not even close to his usual fine writing.Scream at the Sky is well-written and comes close to Prom Night Murders as one of my favorites by him.
5,This Show is AWESOME,"Seriously, I'm so glad I stumbled on this show. It's dark and witty and just plain hilarious. Super highly recommended!"
4,I was wrong,When I saw commercials for this show I thought that it must be so stupid - but I was wrong. It is very funny and extremely well done.
5,I love the show,"Great quality, great pricing. It took me a while to finally get hooked on the show. I couldn't get past the talking human-dog. Give it a shot. You won't regret it. Also, I like shows that have morals (I don't need a lesson in religion). I guess I should clarify. I like shows that have clearly defined reasons for being.."
3,Season 2 is a disappointment,"Wilfred Season 1 was engaging, funny- an unexpected delight. We were very excited to see Season 2 and powered through all episodes in one weekend. Overall, it was very disappointing. The quirky humor was scarce, replaced with dark twisted type story lines. After watching each episode, the response was something like ""that was weird."" The last three episodes of the season were more like Season 1. Those gave us hope that the funny, witty Wilfred may return for season 3!"
3,too short for $$,this show is only 22 minutes. not worth $2. I would buy more if it was $1. it is really funny but I can wait for it to go to netflix.
2,Show is still too vague,"Other than the episode with Robin Williams, I thought this season was a disaster. It's still completely vague, and has no semblance of even beginning to answer questions viewers have.To me, the writer understands he will be receiving further seasons and just strings us along. This season was not funny enough, and the characters not appealing enough, for me to warrant anyone to buy it."
1,Blah,"The first season of Wilfred was wonderful. What happened? So far the second season is depressive and boring. I often find myself leaving the room while the episode is still playing, because my mind is elsewhere."
3,"Nice overview, but lacks concrete guidance","This book excels at drawing the line between leader-driven and team-driven groups of individuals. It also characterizes some of the failure cases very well -- teams that are too large, teams that don't have a clear vision and purpose, teams that are disconnected from the rest of the organization, etc.However, I struggled to see how to clearly draw the line between which style to guide your team into. The rough guidance seemed a bit self-referential: ""when the task can best be done with a single leader, do it with a single leader."" What about if you're not sure? Try both and take it as a lesson learned? Maybe I just missed it, but the book lacked the critial information I needed to be able to fully apply it in my situation."
2,Bad download,Thte book is excellent but the digital copy was messed up. Pages jump from 89 to 97 to 124. The format needs to be corrected. I recommend buying a hard copy until this problem is solved.
3,It gets you through your 1st field dressing,Very handy fold out. Has decent pictures and directions.Laminated so you can wipe it off when you're done.I would recommend it to anyone who is new to deer hunting and does not have experienced hunter with them.
1,Dangerous Product,"I returned these guide-ons immediately after opening the package. The angle of the base supports IS NOT 90 degrees as depicted in the ad. Rather, they are configured to angle outward from the trailer. I've had issues with other guide-ons where the trailer lights protrude from the top of the guide-on beyond the trailer resulting in damage at toll booths, danger to pedestrians in tight areas and danger to oncoming traffic. I will NOT put these guide-on brackets on my trailer. Thankfully Amazon has an ""easy return"" policy and I am only out the little time it took to bring this package back to the local UPS store."
5,great product,"works connection always makes a great product. High quality, protects the frame perfectly and looks great. Can't ask for more"
4,Acerbis fender,Well made fender with exact color match of original with better look than the factory fender that came on bike.
4,Good Bach,"Well, this is what I call good Bach, a well played Bach. Very relax music for people that like barok music. Not a must, but a good item for a good colection."
1,Waste of Money,This book is boring. Reader speaks in monotone. Does not hold attention and runs in circles. More informative books available on this subject.
3,Liked The Choices But One,"I can't comment on the DVD but I have seen these episodes and that's what I am basing my rating on. I think they were all great choices except for ""Trakkena's Revenge."" While it wasn't a bad episode from ""Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue"", it wasn't all that great. I think a better choice would've been ""End Of Time"" from Power Rangers Time Force or, if you had to have another crossover of Ranger teams, ""Reinforcements From The Future"" that had Time Force team with Wild Force.Still, this doesn't sound like a bad DVD."
3,Where Are the special Features,"Well, I like the episodes that they have chosen but, they should have given the DvD more special features! Like maybe trivia games or actor profiles and even behind the creating of the power Rangers. I thought it was totally awesome to see all the Red Rangers again. Tommy is the coolest to have seen and also Jason the original Red Ranger. I hope make a series Dvd for the Power Rangers because I am a die hard fan and have watched since the beginning. Other wise the Dvd is cool it just needs more special features and I know that could have done better! So we will just have to wait and see what they come up with next! I wish they also could have had an all power ranger reunion show maybe they will after this next season!"
4,"Best Power Rangers episodes, I don't think so but stil great","It feels great to finally see a power rangers dvd. Bit of a shame though to see the same storyline happening over and over again. Its always got rangers from the fast helping the present rangers out.There are no DVD features unfortunately, not even a chapter index because the episodes are the chapters. The tenth anniversary poster though is really good.As for the episodes they are all good but i'm not sure if they are the best. Best episodes in this dVd have to be White Light and Countdown to Destrution.If you do wish to see the past seasons of Power Rangers on DVD in a box set please sign the petition below:http://www.petitiononline.com/prdvd/petition.htmlIf you do have a power rangers website please do create a link to the petition"
4,The Kids Just Love It,A fun Collection for the entire family to watch together. And a great gift giving idea for anyone who enjoys the Power Rangers.
3,Making a change,"This is really a good DVD. The only thing I would perfer is that they used the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers episode ""Return of the Green Ranger Parts 1, 2 and 3"" instead of White Light. I would have gotten it purchased if it had that episode."
3,"Works Well, But VERY Annoying!!!",The monitor picks up the baby's sounds well from 3 rooms away through 4 walls (doors open). The 2 way communication works well too.On the down side: The monitor makes a loud popping noise as it checks communication with the other monitor every minute or so. It is very annoying and makes it hard to sleep in the room with the reciever. I placed it on the other side of my room and turned the volume down but it was still so annoying that we just turned it off and listened for the baby the old fashioned way.If it weren't for that MAJOR drawback I would have given it a great rating and I guess if you just want to use it for when the baby takes naps and your awake it is fine. I have used it a few times for when I'm in the garage doing things and the baby's sleeping or playing.
2,disappointing,"This product is lightweight, easy to set up and stylish, but this is where its plus points finish. I like the fact that the monitor is silent and clicks on only when the baby makes noise, but this silence is disturbed every few minutes by the parent monitor clicking on and searching for a connection with the baby unit. The sound coming from the unit was also fairly muffled.Although the unit comes with rechargeable batteries (which the instructions say take 12 hours to charge up without the unit even being on) our unit did not work if it was not connected to the mains supply.Overall, I found this monitor very disappointing and it is going back!"
5,great product !!! loved it !!!,"I purchased the Digital Ultra Audio Monitor after a friend of mine recommended it. I had the Summer Infant Digital Monitor but it wasn't very clear and the distance was not a lot. The sound on this is much more clear and having a longer range was a definite plus. Overall, I would recommend this model to other people looking for a secure digital audio monitor. Also the Two Way paging & Wakkie Talkie feature is also great!"
1,Didn't work,What a waste of money. I got this monitor for my mom for Xmas. She cares for my disabled brother and needed a new one. This didn't work since the day we got it out of the box and ended up in the trash and we bought a new different monitor. It was a ton of money to waste. Don't buy this monitor!
2,sucks,"maybe the one i order off of here was defective but the volume on the parental unit was VERY VERY low even when i turned it all the way up. and the dang thing made a popping noise when the baby made a noise so the popping would wake me up from sleep, but then i couldn't barely hear the baby crying... i ordered it because of the 2-way walkie talkie function but i retured it. hated it. got myself a different 2-way monitor."
4,tut's mummy,this is a good book for someone around the age of 5 to 7. the book is in really easy to read and in large print. there are 48 pages and it was done in 1988. i think the illustrations could have been a little better. but if you have young kids they might want to read this.
1,Avoid this book if you're looking for comfort,"This book might be helpful if you are looking for detailed medical information, but it generally scared the daylights out of us. We were taking things a step at a time, not knowing how much medical intervention we'd be comfortable with, and this book consistently left us feeling frightened that we were in for a major ordeal. We eventually threw it in the trash -- we did not even include it in the carton of books we donated to the library, lest another couple find it as consistently discouraging."
4,"Descriptive, Concise, and Hopeful","I read this book before I had my first Laparoscopy and HSG. It helped me to know what to expect, and how the procedure is performed. And (! ) if I should get a disappointing diagnosis, which I did, I had it all right there in my hands. From PCOS to Endo to Adhesions, it has it all, but not everyone has it all. And for this reason I found it extremely helpful for many friends of mine who have a different diagnosis than I to give them descriptive reference. What I especially liked about the Author was his way of ""looking"" into his patients feelings. I wish more doctors would take that extra, yet essential time, to really know their clients."
4,Good for Special Educators,"I had to buy this textbook last year, as I was getting my teaching endorsement in Special Education. It is a good text, although mostly only useful if you are studying this for ceritification (I haven't used since I've been teaching)."
5,Great Teaching Resource!,"I've used this book since it was originally print. I've needed to purchase additional copies over the years because once someone borrows mine, it never seems to make it's way back. It's that good!. I love the strategies, the pacing, and the ability to choose what works for your students."
4,Added Practice,This has been a great supplement for my high school English classes. The kids love it and they get a chance to work and look at words differently. They are using skills they don't use on a regular basis. It's quite a challenge for most!
5,Grisom does it again!,Michael Grissom just keeps showing why he is one of the South's favorite non-fiction writers. His down-home style guides the reader effortlessly through the trials and triumphs of a Southern life that outsiders just can't understand. Every Southerner should read this book to remember where he's from. Every Yankee should read it and try to understand where we're from.
3,common sense,really didn't tell me anything I didn't already know or find out from my doctors. I guess it would be good for those who suspect they have it and want to try modifications before seeing a doctor
4,Good First Diagnosis Book,"Found the book informative except for dietary information. If you have irritable bowel there is no way to do the diets that are listed in this book. Symptoms would flare. Otherwise, the book was very informative."
3,Very good information - maybe too technical for some,"This book is chock full of really good information about fibromyalgia. However, it may be a bit overwhelming for the newly-diagnosed and those unfamiliar with the myriad medical terms used to describe it. For a less intimidating version of much of the same information, seeTender Points: A Fibromyalgia Memoir Filled with Practical Advice"
5,Wonderful Book,I loved this book got it at the library. But like it so much I am going to go get one to keep. As a lot of good stuff in it. Most have for fibromyalgia patient.
4,The First Year-Fibromyalgia: An Essential guide for the Newly Diagnosed,Excellent book for the person who's been diagnosed with FMS as this book touches on everything. Provides a listing of symptoms from A-Z along with insight on how difficult it can be to get Social Security Disability. It also offer's tips on ways to save energy and most importantly pacing yourself.
4,Definete classic,"This is one of those movies that cannot be overlooked or forggotten about. I swear its almost like a gangster movie written by shakspear. For me its very inspirational, and thought prevoking. Sad to say but probably the last relevant and deep roles played by my boy snipes, similair to pachino in carlitos way. Love this movie."
3,Movie DV D,"Very good movie , not sure if its the movie are D V D player , but the movie was sounding a little funny and at the end it play but the sound had went out . Will look at the movie again and see what's going on"
3,Sugar Hill DVD Review,"A good movie; however, the musical score, which primarily consisted of a trumpet, became rather irritating after a while. I would've enjoyed this film more with an orchestral score and some suspenseful music at appropriate scenes."
3,A movie worth seeing,"The story line was unique and entertaining. Showing Snipes as a complex individual, not just a money hungry drug dealer. The twist and turns the move takes keeps your attention, and the ending surprising. The camera direction was rather flat with moments of interest,but the over all direction I would say was good. you won't be dissappointed, I wasn't"
1,DOA - don't work,"I bought this USB to connect a computer to a project. Tried many, many times to get it to work, it never worked. Substituting with a shorter USB cable and the shorter cable worked just fine. So the conclusion is that this cable was DOA. I decided not to return it because it was cheap enough to count as loss."
2,Not for experienced mortgage professionals....,"I would not recommend this book to individuals WITH mortgage experience. This book was not very informative considering that I have 2+ years or mortgage lending experience. A third of the book was wasted with interviews of professionals that gave very similar responses. In my opinion, this book is better suited for individuals who are switching industries and want to know a LITTLE more about the mortgage industry."
1,I should have know.,"I really wouldn't usually waste my time writing a book review, but this is a warning rather than a review. This book is nothing more than an advertisement for the author's on-line brokerage school. The redundancies and grammatical errors in this ""book"" make it even more insulting. Take my advice and save your $20."
1,This is not a book to learn anything,This book is simply useless. All this book does is advertise the website of this author. Worst book I ever read in my whole life. Save your money.
1,Two thumbs down,The Information in this book you can get from any School with one phone call. This book is a waste of time and money. The author promotes his web site throughout the book... I went to the web site and it was more of the same. Shame on the Author for calling this a book. When it should be called a commercial.
1,"Good for people thinking about starting in the industry, terrible for everyone else","I've been in the mortgage industry for a very short time (about 7 months), but I am always looking for new ways to sharpen my client interaction techniques. I was very excited to see this book, but once I read through it, I've got to say I'm very disappointed. Anyone whose been in the industry for more than 3 months could have written the content inside this book; it's more of an overview of how the mortgage industry works. That, plus the second half of the book is a marketing tool for more expensive training programs (up to $500 for something you can find at loantoolbox) give this book 1 paltry star."
1,Very Disappointed,"This book was extremely BASIC. Hardly any useful information at all. If you have ever taken out a mortgage, you already know most of this. It was almost a total waste of money. The main focus of this book is to sell you a much more expensive program(s)."
4,This book in very helpful,I was impressed with the writing in this book. I think that this book should be used as a teaching guide.
4,So You Want to Be a Mortgage Broker,The book was very informative and I think it is a great help. It is full of imformation. But the only problem that I have is during the reading the author keeps plugging the next volume that is very expensive. But I guess that is just business so I really cant fault them on that. But I recomend for someone starting out in the business.
3,Good information,I purchased the book to learn more about the industry. I found the detailed infomation regarding the loan origination function and the big picture view of the mortgage process very helpful. I especially found the interviews at the end useful. My only complaint is that the author seemed to run out of steam in the last few chapters of the book and ended up giving redundant and somewhat useless information.
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!,This book is such a rip off considering it's a double waste--waste of both time and money!!! The author spends a great deal of time explaining how rewarding and how much money being a morgage broker can make because in the beginning of the book they're promoting their website and their publishing company for their products to help you becoming a broker! Shame on them! They have no integraty and it appears to me that the author has minimal education or competance in loan processing and brokerage. I would have given it a -1 if I can!
2,A Hgh Priced Advertisement,Although there is a fair amount of grounded useful material here there is an inordinate amount of self-promotion and selling of other product offered by Mr. Kamadia's company. Almost one third of this book(sometimes subtly placed often blatant) is an attempt to sell the reader other product. Wish I had bought it directly through the publisher so I could ask for a refund.
2,Mortgage Training,I found this book to be absolutely useless. When I bought I thought it would give information on how to get into the mortgage business. I got more information on the web. The person who wrote this book kept mentioning his website which was also useless.Whatever you do don't buy this book save your money.
2,Brief Overview of Industry with Huge Emphasis on Marketing other Books,"Having just entered the field, I was curious to see what this book had to offer. One has to be impressed at Mr. Kamadia's enthusiasm for the field and 'rah rah' spirit to motivate others, but I also feel a bit ""sold"". The book is primarily a podium of advertising Mr. Kamadia's other expensive and packaged 'mortgage training' manuals and kits. I was disappointed with that aspect and certainly don't think it's worth the advertised $19.99.I can't begrudge the guy for his marketing efforts, but have a little respect for the reader and prospective professional. He regurgitates the same marketing hyperbole on his site and frankly, I was not convinced that this was the place to spend money to make money."
1,...,"Save yourself time and money - run a Google search to get info on the subject. This book is worthless, the author mainly advertises their websites."
2,cambell cream of mushroom,I judge all books on Louisiana cooking aganst Paul Prudhomme's great Louisiana Kitchen that's a high standard but a worthy one. Emeril comes up short. When a cook book author lists LeGout thick Chicken Base as an intigral igrediant can Cambell's soup be far behind? The truth is that a lot of these Louisiana glopy mixtures do tast really good. So I'm sure that these recipes will work and after a couple of good Martinis they are just great.But they do not lead us to our Better Cooking Angels.
2,There are better books out there to learn VB.NET,"This book is way too elementary. It is also hard to use it as a reference book as it's not organized very well. If you have any programming experience at all with programming, you should consider some other books. I've had good success with Wrox, O'Reilly, and Microsoft Press books. Programming C# from O'Reilly was good."
2,Lacking command appendix,"As if learning any high level language from a book wasn't hard enough - This text seems devoid of any elements that would make it a usefull reference, i.e. no VB command appendix. Have a specific question with respect to VB code? Look elsewere. The organization is as clear as my TA's thick accent."
1,Not even close to the right info for a 2000 Nissan MAxima,"This book was purchased to diagnose and repair some problems I am having with my 2000 Nissan Maxima. The book did not have any wiring or electical diagrams for anything above a 1999 Maxima and the proceedure to diagnose computer fault information was not even close to correct.It took me about 2 hours to remove the computer module only to find out that the switch that was suppose to be there according to the book did not exist.Also, the book shows components that are not in my Maxima and my Maxima has components that are not in the book. I would not buy this book if you have a 2000 or 2001 Maxima!!!!"
1,no satisfaction on the saller,the book saynissan Maxima 1993 to 2001 but you send me a book from 1993 to 1999that i was not happy.
3,small,"This is a very small charm. It does not come with a clasp - I had to bend it open (needle nose pliers) and onto my wife's bracelet. The first one I received was missing the stone altogether. However, the customer service was nice and sent out a replacement quickly. Would buy again."
3,Decent,"My child likes old cartoons, but a lot of these are particularly loud and raucous. Some of them are ok."
3,B/W Redrawns? WHY?,"I bought this DVD hoping to see the black-and-white cartoons in their original form, especially ""Ali Baba Bound"", since that's my favorite Porky Pig cartoon. Unfortunately, the version of that cartoon on this DVD as well as ""Porky's Café"" and ""Notes to You"" are HAND-DRAWN colorized versions from the 1960s that are just ""color-changed"" with some sort of software to look B/W again.Also, the quality of the cartoons isn't FASCINATING, as this is from a PD company, but some of the cartoons still look great, while others are good or fair in terms of picture quality.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this DVD *too* highly, especially considering that some of the cartoons on this DVD have been released in MUCH better quality on the LTGC sets, which I recommend you buy instead. I'll name them for you:""Pigs in a Polka"" (1943)Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Vol. 3""The Booze Hangs High"" (1930) & ""Confusions of a Nutzy Spy"" (1943)Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Vol. 6"
3,"good dvd, but too expensive","Don't be a sucker like I was. I paid $17 for this dvd, and it is definitely not worth that. However, if you search ""Porky Pig"" on Amazon, it will bring up another version of the same dvd, and it is currently going for less than a dollar. Just don't be taken advantage of. Go the cheap route. This dvd is worth a buck or two."
5,Granny Smith Apple Candle,"Bought this for a friend. Yankee Candle isn't making the Granny Smith candle anymore so he was delighted when I was able to get it!It really fills the room with the apple smell, and it doesn't take long either!"
3,Candles,"I liked the candles very much. They are exactly what I expected. However, one of them broke during shipping and by the time I received them, it was impossible to salvage the broken candle."
1,Terrible,Had similar problems to the other two reviewers. No instructions. Light was alwaya red. Remote did not work well when battery pack was used.
3,OK,"The coiled cable part of this charger should be longer. It works fine, but would fit my needs better if the coiled cord was about a foot longer."
4,"Works great, long cord allows phone to sit anywhere","This charger works great and has a very long cord which allows my cell phone to sit anywhere in my car (Pontiac Grand Prix), even my daughter can use the phone in the back seat while it is charging! Definitely a good buy."
3,Works with V170,"Contrary to a previous review, the charger I received was exactly as pictured and works just fine with the Moto V170."
3,Annoying whistling noise,This water kettle was purchased for an office kitchen area which is attached to offices and a conference room. It was great for 3 days and then a horrible whistling sound started every time water was boiled. This noise was high pitched and unbearable for those around to listen to throughout the day. Perhaps at home this wouldn't bother you as much.
2,Didn't Work for Me,"Even on low setting, the water comes to a full, rolling boil and continues to boil when kettle is removed from base. Also, the shape, thickness and position of the handle make holding and pouring very difficult for my small, arthritic hands. I returned this kettle."
3,Meh,"I purchased this for work. I have a Philips kettle at home that has been discontinued and this looked the closest in design and features. I've used it almost daily for 2 months and so far it does what it says.I only gave it three starts because the construction seems a little shoddy - there are uneven seams and sometimes the button to start the heating process won't stay down when pushed. Usually all it takes is a second push to get it to engage but one day it would not stay engaged for anything. This was after only about a month of operation, thankfully when I tried it the next day it worked again.All in all it works perfectly fine and I like the fact that the outside doesn't get too hot even when the water is at a rolling boil. It's just not my Philips."
5,"Dependable, Dependable, Dependable","We now have used this kettle for almost 6 months every day, several times a day, with no problems. The heat dial setting allows us to choose our ""perfect"" water temperature. It is easy to clean and keep clean. It is easy to fill and to dispense. It heats up fast. Best of all, it is dependable, every day for the past 6 months."
4,use it everyday,"It boils water faster than anything I have in my kitchen. When you want a cup of tea, this is what you need. It does not keep the water hot, but you can always re-boil.I now have two of this pot because I liked it so much. Only negative point is the ""auto shut-off"" system which sometimes does not work fast enough. I usually manually shut off if the water is boiling too long."
5,Just what we wanted,"When our Philips kettle died, we thought we'd be disappointed with another manufacturer's product, but this one is terrific. White plastic outside does not conduct heat like the stainless steel ones we dislike. We are very pleased."
2,Returned because of smell.,"The design is fine, but the kettle and the watercontinued to smell of plastic after two weeks(and after following the suggested treatment)."
2,Plastic kettle is not good,"I got this without fully understanding that the whole inside was plastics. When the water was hot, I didn't taste any difference, but as someone noted, when the water cooled down, it really tasted like plastics, which means something got in in the process of boiling. Otherwise, it is a nice-looking kettle and it boils very quickly, too. But because of the taste of cooled down water, I returned."
1,Flimsy hinge,"I bought one at Fry's today. I was a bit concerned, though, that the shelf was full of returns.When I unpacked it and opened the cap, it immediately broke off. Its hinge is constructed as a couple of flimsy plastic tabs (just 0.5 mm thin!), which was simply ripped out by the spring.I returned this piece of dung, ang got Cuisinart instead.I've been using a Krups kettle for 9 years and it was flawless, but the heater started to lose coating and it become a bit slow to shut off."
4,Great product,"I use this kettle at work multiple times a day. It is fast and quiet. The only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars is because only the bottom of the pitcher is metal - the balance is unlined plastic. While it still stays hot, it has taken about a month to get rid of that ""new-plasticy"" taste."
4,Bulky but very efficient,"If the design were a little sleeker, the T-Fal Electric Kettle would have garnered a full five stars. Functionally the kettle is perfect: lightning fast at coming to boil, cordless, has the nice viewing window. We banished it from the kitchen due to its bulbous shape, but brought it back because it is so convenient."
1,"Been 3 months, still has plastic stink","I absolutely didn't want to write this review. I love T-Fal as a brand and have bought three units of the previous (1.0L) model of the Vitesse Kettle which have been performing wonderfully for the past 5+ years.All that said, this unit delivered to me still (after 3!! months) has a plastic/VOC scent that is not only overpowering when you open the lid, but is infused in my water when I boil it.Needless to say, this completely ruins the aroma/flavor of any tea I make using this (which is the main use of the kettle). Other reviews had mention that stink goes away, but hell, it's been 3 months. How long am I supposed to wait?Do yourself a favor and pass on this (and probably any other plastic model) as it will ruin your beverage."
4,Works well,"This is a great tea pot that works extremely well. Our last one lasted about two years (My wife drinks a lot of tea!) and got a bit loud towards the end. That being said, we bought another!"
3,good product,"strong and durable, it is a good product. users have to be aware of the buildup at the bottom of the inside. You have to wash constantly if you leave water in there, there will be some sort of spotting, could be 'scaling'."
5,Glad I bought it!,"Works great! Looks great! I haven't noticed any plastic taste, as written in some reviews: just follow the manufacturer's directions and rinse it thoroughly. All other features work perfectly well, as stated in the product description. The tap water in my town is very good, but I've been using distilled water, as other users have mentioned that the quality of water is also important."
2,functional but breaks down too soon,"I bought it to replace a Bodum Ibis which have lasted me (I've had two) about a year or two. For some reason they did not have them in stock, so I went for T-fal vitesse. This one broke after about five months. When I turn it on, it begins to heat the water but shuts off a third of the way to the boiling point. I have to press the on-button with my finger until the water boils - about 3 minutes. Not a nice way to start the day.Back to Bodum Ibis."
4,"No more scaldings, thank you.","I recently dropped the coffee habit and switched to the world of tea.I started boiling water in a pan on the stove and realized that it was like handling a small nuclear reaction when pouring into the tea cup. Also, we have a huge commercial stove with 25,000 BTU burners so forgetting the pot while boiling was always a bit life-threatening. So we got the T-Fal and entered the 21st century. It's great.A carefully thought out kettle.Pop a button and the water heats up and turns off when ready.The kettle lifts away form the base leaving power cord behind.Pour directly from the container without having to open the lid. What a great product."
4,Good Quality,"I had to replace my old kettle and after some research I purchased this one. It has some great features, you can see the water level and you can set how hot you want it to get. The only drawback is that it is heavy."
3,Poor Handle Design,"Ok,I just purchased and received the kettle. Quick fulfillment by Amazon, as always.I have no doubts that what people say about the kettle is true in terms of it heating up water well, etc. I do like the plate in the bottom rather than coils. The pop on and rotate base is very nice, rather than the click into one position. The appearance is nice, so I won't have a problem keeping it on my desk at work.*however* The handle is ergonomically a poor design. It's very difficult to hold the kettle when full. Because of how rounded it is, the natural position is at the top of the handle, but this tips over the teapot. Then the only way to carry it safely is to hold the front and the handle, which is problematic, because it is too hot!As previous reviewer said, the cord could be a bit longer. I'll have to buy an extension. 4 feet sounds long, but isn't as long in practice.I regret not buying one at the store now.It's worth considering whether you can pick up and carry the teapot.L"
5,Quick hot water,This was purchased to replace a unit the went to it's reward after 10 years of good service. This unit seems to heat faster and the size is ideal to our needs. I believe that the electric use for this device is less than either the stove or microrange units. Plus it reaches boiling much quicker.While it's new and can't speak to long term use the first unit met all of the criteria we could have expected.
1,Yuck indeed,I agree with the reviewer who rated the taste of the water heated in this appliance as YUCK. I also experienced a problem with the switch turning itself off about 5 times in a row before it will stay on. Neither Tfal not Amazon was willing to help me with replacement. A Yucky experience all around.
1,Dissappointed,Not happy at all with this item. I received this Electric Kettle the day after I ordered it. I purchased it based on the excellent service we had gotten from another T-Fal Kettle (almost 5 years of heavy usage). I plugged the new kettle in and it worked the first time ONLY!!!! The switch kept malfunctioning every time after that - I tried the kettle at several different outlets with the same result. I returned the item and got a refund. I subsequently purchased a Chefs Choice International Kettle also from Amazon and it works perfectly.
3,No values on temperature control,I liked the kettle but got it to make tea so needed to be able to set it to specific temperatures for different types of tea and since the were no specific temperatures on the control I couldn't do that.
4,T-Fal BF6520004 Vitesse 1.7L Electric Kettle,"This kettle heats 1.0L of room temperature filtered water in about 2 minutes, maybe a little less. It's convenient to use, the heating element is covered, and the design is easy to handle. I keep it on the middle setting which is supposed to be hot ready to drink, but it actually boils the water for about 10 seconds. There is a bit of a plastic taste to the water if allowed to cool and then reheat in the kettle. I understand that eventually that goes away, but after 20 uses or so, that taste has not disappeared. I simply empty the kettle and start with fresh water."
1,Very bad design,"I bought this water kettle due to the many good reviews on amazon. However, It turned out to be one of the worst water kettle I have ever owned. My previous water kettle lasted me a good 4 years and the only reason I tossed it was due to it becoming exceedingly dirty inside. The design of this kettle leaves a lot to be desired. I found the 3-way setting on the front ugly and pretty much useless. Moreover, the knob fell off after about 1 month of use. I've had it now for about 3 months and now the contacts are starting to fail so that it is not always obvious whether the kettle is actually on or not. My other kettle made a nice ""ding"" sound when it was done. There is no way to tell when this kettle is done except by the light on the front that is not always easy to see. In all, I'm not quite sure why it is rated as highly as it is. I give it a 1-star."
3,T-Fall Electric Kettle BF6520004 Vitesse,The kettle seems to work but the heating element doesn't fit with the kettle well.My old one fits securely. This one rocks.
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!,"Gave to my husband as a gift and this thing is AMAZING! heats water SOOOO quickly that we don't boil water anymore we use this to heat all water needed for cooking etc. So easy to use and heats water up FAST! Love that the heating element is seperate from it. It's really great that it detaches from the base which makes it more convenient to pour. We have used this for over a year and have had no issues with it. We use it daily.CONS: it would not be wise to use this for things other than water..you can, but it gets stuck to the bottom and it is very hard to clean whatever you cooked in it."
3,not pretty but does the trick,"It works just fine but it looks ""short and stubby"". Since it is one the counter I would prefer a nicer looking pot. it looks better in the picture than in person."
5,Fabulous Buy,"This electric tea kettle is great! It even has a filter in the intake spout. It's very very good to know it heats water so quickly and the fact that the cord can be rewinded in the base, is an excellent feature."
5,mom likes it,I bought it as a gift for my mother. She loves it says it works fast and she never has a problem with it.
5,Electric Tea Triumph,"This is a top notch product with a bargain basement price. I couldn't get a Braun so I ""settled"" for T-Fal. How fortunate for me! Fills easily; heats fast; boil or not,your choice."
5,purchased for my older parents and they love it,"*Auto shut off as soon as it boils and keeps water hot*can be placed on the base in any direction*easy water fillPurchased for my parents in their 70's. They use to use tea kettle on the stove and ruined a couple stove tops with them. Perfect, I am now back to buy one for myself!"
4,Love this kettle!,"It heats water quickly, and has a temp setting for different water temps... only downside is it is heavier than my previous one, but I still like it... a lot!"
4,Best at the moment,"This seems to be the only fully temperature controlled auto-kettle around.The temperature control is not fine enough or easy to control. But it does help make water for teas that need to be steeped at lower-than-boiling temperatures.It is annoying to adjust the temperature, but once one gets it to the right temperature, it stays there pretty well. For that I own three and use a different one for each temperature I need, instead of fighting with the thermometer adjustment each time. Luckily it is cheap enough to manage that."
5,Excellent water kettle!!!,This is the 2nd water kettle I vbought. The first one was for me and the second was for a wedding gift. Seriously this is the best water kettle. I've never seen water heat up so quickly before and on those cold mornings it's fantastic and holds enough water for our family of 8.
5,Efficient electric kettle,This product heats water very quickly and has the capacity for heating quite a bit of water. It can handle larger quantities for soup stock or a small quantity for a cup of tea.
4,Very happy with purchase!,"We bought this kettle to replace a Philips that we really liked but unfortunately I could not get the same one anymore. After looking at kettles forever and reading reviews we finally decided on the T-fal and did not regret it. It is sturdy enough but not too heavy, has a big opening so cleaning won't be a hassle and is cordless. The only ""complaint"" I have is that the handle could be a little thinner but that's something minor that we'll get used to. Some people complain about the ""plastic taste"" that comes off a plastic kettle, but we use it for coffee, tea, hot chocolate ... and it all tastes just fine.My son especially likes the temperature control, he can make his cup of hot chocolate and it is ready to drink immediately. The price seems right, too (after all, it's just a kettle)."
4,t-fal kettle,"having been able to use a 220/240v kettle up to now, I bought this as it had a high wattage to help with the 110v electricity - still a bit slow to boil but otherwise fine: sturdy, reasonable design."
5,I hope it lasts,My last three cordless electric kettles failed after only one or two years. This ones appears solid and heats the water much faster than the others.
3,"OK, but...","It's OK, but still not what I was looking for. I wanted something that would make hot water and NOT turn it self off. It does get the water nice and hot though."
4,"Really nice, but...","...still not as fast as the ones in Europe. I don't know why the electric kettles sold in America can't keep up with them! Still, its a nice product, and I'm enjoying it."
1,Will not function out of US.,"When I looked at the model, it had everything I wanted. Unfortunetely I didn't do enough research. It will NOT take 240V. When I opened it up and read 120V, I immediately knew it was going back. Nowhere in the description does it state 120V only."
1,Not good enough . . .,"This T-Fal kettle was purchased and returned within the space of 24 hours. The kettle had a strong plastic smell no matter how many times it was carefully cleaned according to the accompanying directions. If water smells or tastes like plastic it can't be safe to drink!Instead, try the Bonjour Renoir Electric kettle, which I finally found after much searching. It is better designed, of higher quality materials, works beautifully, and looks like an electric kettle should. Stay away from the T-Fal. Not worth the money. Not good enough."
1,smell and taste of plastic,"Looks great. Boils water fast. But I can not get rid of the smell and taste of plastic in the water. The directions included with the product warn of this problem -- sort of scary, now that I think about it -- and provide the ""solution"" to the problem. I followed those instructions, the smell and taste problem disappeared for awhile, but after having not used the kettle for a few months, the problem is back. My Earl Grey tea tasted funny, and the water remaining in the kettle smells plastic-y. So, I'll be chucking this thing in the garbage can and buying a kettle that is made of metal and glass. I recommend you do that too."
2,Poor design of the lid shutter - won't last,"The kettle is overall ok, but the lid shutter is very poorly made, and it becomes loose very soon - ours didn't last longer than 2 years. Now the lid opens randomly and you can get burned easily by vapor. There is no way to fix it."
2,tastes like plastic,"Bought this because it had good reviews, and I remember seeing one that said the water didn't taste like plastic, but I have given it a week and I still taste plastic. I don't know what I was thinking. But if you are a tea drinker, don't buy this unless you like the taste of plastic."
1,T-Fal Vitesse kettle--POOR quality,"This tea kettle had a promising look and functionality. Unfortunately, it is of poor quality. After several days it stopped working. It would not turn on. I wonder how hard is it to make a working appliance that simply boils water in the 21st century!!! While the design is well thought of, the manufacture of an appliance is so disappointing.One good thing about this transaction is the Customer Service at Amazon!"
1,Water tastes of plastic,"This kettle has to be a health concern. I have been using it for about a week now and the water still tastes strongly of plastic. I followed the manufacturer's suggestion to fill the kettle with water, add two tablespoons of sodium bicarbonate and boil. This made no difference whatsoever. I am planning to contact the consumer safety services to have them investigate this issue."
5,Great,"Got myself one recently. I use it mostly for morning tea and/or coffee, works great. Also really like the design, no complaints whatsoever."
4,Good quality,"Tried to be cheap and decided to go with Kalorik, what a mistake! (See separate review for the Kalorik 57-oz kettle). I returned the Kalorik and got this one instead. As all previous electric kettles I've used in Europe, the quality is top, the materials are great, the temperature control is useful, everything fits, and there's no exposed electric wiring as in some other brands. The design is a bit too conservative for my taste, but that's about it. In terms a value, this is about $10 more than the cheap quality models, and also 10 times better. Spend the extra $10, buy quality, and be safe."
3,Good kettle but poorly balanced,"Works well but it's awkward and hard to handle unless you have very big hands. The handle is quite big around and the pot isn't very well balanced. I have several large pitchers that are easy to lift/carry because the handle is designed so that the weight is carried by the handle. Unfortunately, the handle on this kettle just hangs off the side and when there's water in the pot it tends to fall forward unless you balance it with your other hand. Except for it's awkwardness, it works very well and boils water quite quickly."
2,T-fal kettle,Dissapointed because of bad taste of the boiled water for making tea on repeated occassions resulting in the purchase of a different make.I thought that it was a stainless steel product as it was advertised and it was not;It was made of some odour emitting plastic.
2,Didn't like it.,We returned the BF6520003 Electric Kettle because it did not sit securely on it's stand. It felt very tippy. So we are still looking for an electric kettle.
2,unergonomic handle,"Due to the bad ergonomics, this is very hard to lift with one hand when the kettle is nearly full (compared to the several other same capacity kettles I tested). It is usable if you use both hands to hold the kettle when lifting and pouring.Note that there is a smaller model, the new ""T-fal BF6138US Balanced Living 1750-Watt Electric Kettle with Variable Temperature, 1-Liter, Black"", which has the same badly designed handle, but is smaller."
5,Love Love Love it!!!!,"Finally no odor, no bad taste...love this tea pot!!!! We had so much trouble finding one that didn't taste bad after 1 0r 2 pots of water. We started heating our water in the microwave."
2,great idea but needs improvment,"The toy is great... If it had some way to make it safer. It rolls way to fast when there supporting there wait one it... It causes it to roll forward way to fast. Especially on hardwood floors but even on our carpet. If it.had some kind of device were you could ajust some kind of breaking system that weight and surface of floor, i believe it would.be.much.safer, easier and teach them more quickly"
3,My baby does not use it at all,"I bought a used one for my daughter and she never used it. She never used any walkers anyway because she had us-the human walkers, which are way better than any other types of walkers."
1,DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!! WORST TOY EVER,"This is the worste walk and ride toy ever!!! Its is to flimsy and wobbly, no toddler will be able to safetly use it. Should be recalled."
1,Not safe!,I bought this for my 9 month old daughter to encourage walking. It is cute but that is all! The plastic is very flimsy and flips over very easy. It flips over if she tries to pull up on it or is just pushing it. She is rather small so I can not imagine a normal sized baby having any luck with it either. The wheels also don't turn very well. I do not recommend!
2,You get what you pay for ( not much ),"This toy is cheap,unstable,boreing and doesnt encourage walking. If anything This toy is ok for the ride on function, but definitely useless as a walker. My 11 month old doesnt even exspress an interest in this toy. He likes to sit on it and play hide and seek with the back compartment for about two minutes at a time and thats about it. The walker is so light weight that its just a bad fall waiting to happen. If you do purchase this you should only use it on carpet. Really this thing is nothing but a dust collector and im sorry i waisted the money."
2,Boring and too light,"This toy doesn't really do much. Didn't hold my daughter's attention for more than a second at any time. Plus, it's just too light and wheels move too fast. Even when she was walking unsupported, it would fly ahead of her and cause her to fall over, or she would tip it over. Buy a more expensive one with more bells and whistles and a bit more weight to it because this thing isn't worth the $20."
4,Great to Grow,My godson loved this toy. He is just about to walk and took to it with enthusiasm. His older brother showed him what was possible and he was smiling. I look forward to see him maturing with the uses of the toy. Good job!
4,good,Putting this together was interesting. The wheel were a pain to put on. I find putting it on carpet during the walking stage ( hes 9 mos) is better. It doesn't slip as much. He likes it.. were just getting into it. Good.. does the job.
3,it's ok,The stride to ride (looks like a lion) is better for walking because this one is too light. Good thing is that it has a lot of bells and whistles.
4,"Great toy, but not for younger babies","I bought this for my daughter when she was 9 months old, and she really didn't play with it that much, until she was almost a year old, only because she couldn't ride on it yet. She never really walked with it, but once she rode on it, she would never get off. She adores it, even though she is too big for it now. I think it is a great toy for a 1-2 year old, but not any younger than that."
4,Excellent value and very durable,"My daughter is around 10 months old and this toy has really become one of her favorites. It is easily assembled, solidly constructed and very tough. A single catch converts it from a ride on to a step behind walker, and the spinning rattles and other accesories are fun as well as not easily removed. If you want a great aid to help unassisted walking this is it, and at a fraction of the cost of some other more complicated versions. I highly recommend (and so does my daughter!)."
2,Had High Hopes,"We received this toy for my daughter's one-year birthday and were disappointed. It is sturdy when used as a walker, but she already seems too big for it (and she is not an abnormally large child). I would not recommend spending money on this toy."
4,More toy than walker,"We got this for my son at 7 months when he started to pull himself up. He's big for his age and when he would pull up on this toy he would always pull it over. He never hurt himself because he never pulled himself far enough off the ground to fall. He loved the ""trunk"" and liked the spinning wheel and the gear shift. He used it for months (and he's hard on toys) and it's still in ""like-new"" condition which is why I gave it 5 stars on durability."
3,It's OK but ain't all that :),My daughter got this toy at 8 months old and seemed to young for it at the time so I keep taking it out to see when she would show interest. She is now 11 months old and still isn't that interested in it. I think that the walker part is not great as it slides away with the slightest pressure and she has fallen with it (my daughter is a good walker now). The biggest warning is the green door on the front has pinched her fingers a few times when she has opened it and then shut it on her finger putting her weight on it so she cannot open it to get them out. Ouch - poor baby!! Still a cute toy for the money.
2,Ok.,I could not get the toy to latch so my son can stand and walk with it. It clicks in and then pops back out. Not worth it.
3,"Excellent Walker, Mediocre Ride-On Toy","It is great for little ones learning to walk. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed the push-toy feature from 9 months to 12 months. However, it is poorly designed as a ride-on toy. It sits too low to the ground, the back wheels are too close to the front, and the rear is too wide. She keeps running over her feet and legs when tying to propel herself forward. However, she still enjoys sitting on the seat and playing with the various knobs and spinners."
2,this toy is not that durable not even on carpet,I am sorry but I have to write a review again on this....Most parents already have the common sense to assist your child when starting out with this toy and supervise them with it....that does not need to be told. Bottom line is that this toy [stinks] in my opinion! My daughter who is 10 months old and walking along furniture and everrything was walking with this toy ( WHILE BEING SUPERVISED...THANK YOU ) and next thing we knew the walker fell sideways and landed on top of her! It rolls too too easily and we have decent carpeting here too. This purchase was a mistake! I am sorry I bought it. There are much sturdier walkers out there and also equipped with better activities than this one!
2,not a winner,"I bought this for my son when he was 10 months old. He enjoyed pulling up to it and being able to move it around, but it is not sturdy and tough enough to be a riding and a push toy. The wheels are very taught, which made it difficult to steer so he could only really enjoy using it when he could push it a long distance, like our driveway. I would save my money and just buy one that they can push around and has other neat stuff on it. He only weighed 16-18lbs and it was very hard for him to get it moving when he sat on it especially with the way it sits so low to the ground. The wheels did not want to budge and it would not glide what so ever when he sat on it. So he was not to fond of riding this toy."
4,Cute Toy,My daughter has really enjoyed this walker. She really loves to ride it in the car position. The only problem we have had is with the little antenna. It is hard for my daughter to get her leg over to sit in the seat. So we just removed it. Now she really goes to town.
3,Not worth the money,"I bought this toy second hand really cheap-and am glad I did. My toddler hasn't used it much for what it's meant for (walking and riding). She does love playing with the spinning rattle and opening and closing the compartment. Otherwise, though she really isn't very interested in it-and never has been. She prefers other ride on toys-like a blanket or a car we got elsewhere. As far as the person who said it was only a carpet toy-I disagree. We have carpet and laminate-and it rolls much better as a ride on toy on the laminate. It does not work well on the carpet at all. I do not recommend this toy unless you find it really cheap.Added Jan. 2007:Another note, my daughter is on the tall side for her age (95%+ every time)-and she began outgrowing this before she turned 2, as a ride-on toy. Her legs are too long to bend at the right spot and be comfortable. So, if you have a tall child and hope they'll be able to use it until they are 3, think about a different ride-on."
2,Not for wood floors!,"This toy is quite fun for my daughter but it's basically a stationary toy that I have to place against a wall so that it doesn't tip over. When the toy is pushed sideways on my wood floors, it easily slides really fast that my daughter sometimes falls flat when she's holding on to it. The wheels are so flimsy that when the toy is moving forward or backward the wheels don't turn, thus it just slides on the wood floor.I definitely do not recommend this toy for wood floors as it has become more of a hazard for my girl than fun."
2,I'd look elsewhere,"We bought this toy for my 4yr old when he was learning to walk, but it didn't last very long. My son had a hard time using it as a ride on, he kept bumping his legs on the side, the bar was right up against his chest as well which did not look very comfortable. I had a hard time getting the toy to lock in the upright locking position as well. It actually collapsed on my son once and resulted in a cut mouth. I ended up sticking it out in the garage after that and it still remains there. I never even bothered to bring it out for my other kids, I am looking into a new walker/ride on combo for my 12 month old twins. This one just didn't cut it for me."
2,"If I can Send Back, I Would Do it","The quality of this toy, it is not that I want it. My boy just used for one afternoon and give it some one else who have a boy of four year old and this person give it some one else."
3,"So far, so good!",I bought this toy used for my son's 1st birthday. He loved the barrel right away. I also loved the 'stick shift' when we put him on the car. He can scoot forward but not backwards yet. H also uses it as a walker without any of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned. I don't think any walkers are sturdy enough for children to pull up on when they are just learning to do so. My son already was a pro at pulling up and he can almost do it unassisted. He has fun pushing the walker across the floor and I am right there in case he slips. I do not feel the wheels move too fast.
2,Save your money!,"My 10 month-old grandson received this toy for Christmas. It came to grandma's house as there was no room for it at home. Although Jake has limited toys to choose from at our house, he rarely plays with this as it is so poorly designed. When he tries to push it from behind, there is no room for his feet so he walks to the side and soon trips over the wheels. His favorite part is the little green door on the front. He likes to open and close the door and put things inside, but the door is hard to open and once he does get it open, it does not stay open (you have to hold it with your other hand) and so he gets frustrated and soon loses interest."
2,poor design,My daughter received this as a birthday gift when she turned one. The walk-behind part of the toy is fine. When you change it over to a ride-on toy is where we had a problem. The toy is shaped so that the sides flare out in the back. It runs over my daughter's feet. If the sides had been straight I think the toy would have been fine. The concept was great but I'm not sure they tested it.
3,not such a good deal,my daughter got this toy for her first birthday and it is cute but she is not all that thrilled with it. it is very had to put together. you preatty much have to sit on top of it to get the wheels on. it is very sturdy on carpet. there is really not that much to do with it.
2,poor directions awakward parts,"After struggling with this thing to assemble it correctly, I tried to lock it in the upright walker position. I had to use excessive force, I still was unable to get it to lock. I took it apart, reassembled it trying to follow the poor black and white illstrations. Even worse now it will not close or lock. I put it together the way I had it, still can't make a walker out of it. (...) I guess some work and others don't. It seems unsturdy with low grade materials, (...) Very unsatisfied with it and I am not looking forward to the headache of assembling it again!"
3,"works, but could be better","We chose this toy because of the price compared with that walk and ride dino thing. Let me tell you, you get what you pay for. The flap on the front does not stay on, it tips very easily, and the wheels do not roll well. That being said, it works. My son walks behind it like an old man behind a walker. Within a week or two of him using it, he was up walking around on his own. He still enjoys pushing it around, though. Overall, it's an alright toy for the price."
2,Not for learners..wheels move to fast.,This was a decent toy but it is for babies in the early stages of walking. My daughter didn't much like it. The wheels move quickly and she can't keep up with it.. yet.
3,It's only OK,"When my 11 month old son decided that walking around pushing around a rectangle laundry basket was the best mode of transportation, my mom decided that her grandson should have a proper walking toy to play with instead of the ""ghetto version"". Besides - it was on sale. Needless to say, after finally figuring out how to use this Walk 'n Ride, my son still prefers to cling onto chairs, laundry baskets, and even small garbage cans to push around. While it's not a total loss as he enjoys pushing this toy around while crawling, I really don't think he actually cares much for this toy. I actually wouldn't recommend buying a walker/pushing toy like this for a kid - it seems like my son is learning how to walk faster by trial and error on regular household items."
2,Not for toddlers learning to walk,"Bought this for my 13 month old as she has started cruising. Turn out the walker is so light, she could not hold on to it and walk without falling forward. She would play it for less than 5 minutes and not take a second look at it for the rest of the day.Overall, I would not recommend this for toddlers learning to walk."
2,Awkward toy,"I got this toy for my daughter's 1st birthday, hoping that it would help her learn to walk and then be a fun ride-on toy for awhile after that. At that point she was too young to ride it but she wasn't really fond of walking it around either. She would kick the wheels and trip while trying to walk, and it seemed to roll too easily so it would just roll away from her faster than she could walk, leaving her flat on her face!Now that she's old enough to ride it, it's too small! When she sits on it her leg movement is so restricted by the yellow handle in the front and the wheels that stick out in the back that she can't push with her feet very well and she just gets very angry.So she's enjoyed putting toys in the little compartment in the front and spinning the toys attached in the back, but we didn't find it to work very well for either of its intended uses."
4,GREAT for Learning to Walk!!,"Willow is crawling like a champ and walking isn't far behind. Since the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends AGAINST buying a walker, I got Willow this instead.The thing I like about it is that it's simple. There isn't too much going on but enough to get her interested. She loves things that spin and this fits the bill for sure. And the thing I really like is that she'll be able to ride it in the future so it's versatile."
3,Flimsy,"My daughter seems to like this toy we just bought it today - it was fairly easy to put together though I did have to use a screw gun. The only problem is if my daughter's legs get any longer she won't be able to ride it - it fits her perfect right now (she is 9 months old) so obviously this toy won't be good for long, not worth the $20 or so that it costed. It's very light weight and tips easily."
1,Just OK toy,"It took about 30 min to put together. Not a pain, but not a snap. The toy is overall just OK: durable, but too lightweight for baby to use independently. The wheels are too slippery when revolving and we slowed it down to baby speed by putting cardboard near the axle (which isnt a permanent solution, but...). The thing only goes straight whereas my daughter zigzags and wanders, so she only walk a few steps with it and leaves it by the wayside. Mostly it gets in the way of her cruising the house and we end up tucking it under the livingroom table. I dont doubt some children love it, but it has not been a favorite in our household. Something sturdier, heavier would be a little better if your child likes this sort of thing."
1,It is ok but,"This toy is somewhat cheaply made. It hasn't broken, but it is light and flimsy. The wheels are just plastic on plastic and don't turn well. The concept of a non walking baby walking behind this in the upright position is not a good one. They can't do that. and after they walk they won't either. My grandson just pushes it like a giant car, from the side. and crawls up to it and pushes it again. and that is about it. Not much to do for a baby."
3,"it s ok product, i wouldnt recommend it","we got this as a present for my daughter's birthday. its nice, but when she ride it, its a lot of effort for me to push this thing. as she get bigger and heavier, it become even more hard for me to push her around. i wish it had a push bar handle. my daughter likes it though. she keep ask me to push her."
3,Nothing Special,"I wasn't thrill about this toy when I bought it for my 10 month old daughter. She wasn't very interested in it. She played with the spinners, but that is about it. I put it in the walker mood and when she tried to walk behind it the toy would roll to fast and would make her fall. There should be something on the wheels to slow them down. I took it back and got her a different toy."
4,"Great toy, but could use a little modification...","I, like some other reviewers, have a few issues with this toy.1) I do not like the ""weird"" way this converts from a walker to a ride-on toy. If you don't make sure that it ""clicks"" into place, it can collapse when in the walker mode.2) I also wish this toy had a wider base when in the walker mode as my daughter tends to kick the plasic part over the wheels while walking behind it.3) When in the ride-on mode, the yellow handle almost presses up against my daughters chest making it difficult to hold on to.That being said, my daughter loves this toy and she still pushes it around the house even though she has been walking for the past 4 months. We also have the ""Laugh and Learn: Stride-to-Ride Learning Car"" which is MUCH more stable as a walker due to its wide rear wheel base and much easier to ride on. I would recommend that one if you were only going to buy one."
4,A Great Grow-With-Me Toy,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 8 months old and she loved it immediately. Unfortunately she was a very small child so she couldn't quite control it on her own in the beginning. As she grew tall enough and strong enough to walk as fast as it rolled it was the perfect way for her to cruise around the house. Now that she is bigger she likes to sit on it in the ride on position. Again though, her legs aren't long enough yet to really push it but she doesn't seem to mind. My daughter truly loves this toy however if you do have a shorter or smaller child you may want to wait until they grow a little or be prepared for a few stumbles. All in all though I would recommend this to other parents."
2,Not a favorite toy at our house...,We bought this for our daughter when she was 8 months old (she's now 11 months). It is one of those toys that sits by itself and collects dust. It doesn't seem to be very sturdy and the base of it is a bit difficult to switch from a walker to a rider. They need to design some sort of control (like a brake) to slow down how fast it moves once your child is behind it using it as a walker. Our daughter busted her lip while using this product because of the lack of control with the wheels and the fact that it isn't very sturdy. I wouldn't recommend this product at all.
4,Good for learning to walk,"My son received this for his 1st birthday. He's never done much riding on it (he waits to be pushed...can't seem to get him to move his feet to do it himself!), but he LOVES to walk behind it and push it. He used it to get around when he couldn't walk on his own. The only thing I would change: it has a little ""antenna"" that is pulled out much too easily -- I ended up putting that piece in a drawer. Otherwise, easy to assemble and great entertainment. He'll sit in front of it and spin the attachments and put things in & out of the ""trunk"" with great fascination."
3,This toy is not safe!,"My husband and I purchased this toy for your son's 1st birthday. The back wheels were so narrow that everytime he tried to walk with it in the upright position, his feet kept hitting the wheels, making it impossible for him to walk with it. When it was in the sitting position, he reached forward for the ""trunk"" compartment and tipped right over! I returned it immediately!"
1,Not too Happy,"We bought our 11 month old this walker and found enough flaws with it to return it to the manufacturer. Our daughter has practically fallen over it because of its unbalanced design. There isn't enough room between the wheels for her ""waddling"" feet. It doesn't lock in the walking position very well. In the riding position, she has opened the front compartment, leaned over, and pinched her fingers as it closed. The antenna pulls off very easily, which can be dangerous in the mouths of babes."
2,Incredibly ugly and possibly unsafe.,"In the photos, this toy looks sort of cute, but in our home, it looked incredibly incredibly ugly. Also the wheels are just injection molded plastic which you press onto molded plastic axles; that is to say, they can slide easily if you have wood floors, and also, there is nothing to regulate the speed at which the wheels roll--not ideal for beginning walkers. We had to catch our son from face planting a few times before we decided to return this toy."
2,Disappointing,"We thought this would be a good idea for our 13 month old granddaughter who was just learning to walk last Christmas. But because she spread her legs to balance she kept banging her legs on the side every time she tried to push it. The way it is designed makes it hard for the child to get up close, it tripped her up and in the end it was hardly ever used. It turned out to be a big disappointment and a waste of money."
3,so so,"my 10 month grandaughter took to this at once... She made about 4 circles aroud the room, and dropped it...She likes it, but she can,t control it very well... She needs adult help to keep it on track... She will have it mastered in about one month.... It was wort the price just seeing her look important, she thought she was walking... She seemed very happy with it...."
1,Bored Easily,"My daughter received this walker/ride ""toy"" when she was 10 months. She didn't show much interest in it at all but I figured when she rounded her first birthday she'd show more interest. - Well she didn't. There's hardly any room for baby's knees... it's hazardous that baby tries to reach 'round to play with stuff in the front... most kids don't have balance mastered yet. It's also UGLY. DON'T BUY THIS!"
3,Not bad but not a favorite!,"I bought this for my son before he was walking. For whatever reason it has never caught on with him. It seems well built and I have no specific complaints with it, it just never interested him. You win some, you lose some..."
2,A little boring,"We have had this toy for a while, we got it when my son was about 9 months old, now he's 16 months. I think he has played with it for a total of 15 minutes in all that time. He plays with it for 30 seconds or so and then gets bored. Even when he was first learning to walk, he didn't find it helpful. It really just takes up more space than it's worth."
2,Falls over,"I don't use the car portion because it's too small for my children (my 14 month old is 33 inches tall).The walker seems better on carpet, but slides too much on hardwood floors. There isn't enough space between the base of the toy and the baby's foot so the walker part isn't really functional either. I'm going to have to give this toy up."
3,Good toy but too distracting for my 10 month old,"I got this walker when my son was 9 months old and was already cruising around holding furniture. I thought this would be perfect to help him walk on his own... he initially loved the toys on walker and tried walking on his own for 2-3 minutes. But since he turned 10 months, he has lost interest in the walking bit and keeps turning it upside down and just bats at the toys but that too, not for too long. I am sure this is a great walker but not for my son so I am actually looking for a walker with zero distractions for my super excitable baby. If anyone has recommendations, please comment on this review - will appreciate it! Thanks!"
3,Pushes way too easily,"I recently bought this for my nine-month-old. She's been pulling herself up to stand and has attempted to take a few tenative steps, but falls immediately when she does. I decided to get her a push toy because I heard that can help babies learn to walk. This toy is way to light weight and rolls way to fast for her. Our home has hard wood floors so on carpet it might be fine. It'll probably be a great toy for her once she's a capable walker since she does enjoy the toys on the front. Right now if she wants to walk with it I have to have to walk too since it can get out of control very quickly. Also a few days later, a refill box of 700 and some wipes came and she started using it immediately to help herself walk. The wipes box actually works great since I can adjust the weight of the box by filling it or removing the wipes packages."
3,Don't need it...,"This was given to our son as a Christmas gift when he was 9 months old. He played with the little toys on the front a few times, but every time I tried to get him to walk with it he would get upset... the plastic wheels are just way too smooth and it moves too quickly. It would maybe be okay once they're walking a little but could use something to stabilize them, but at that point you really just don't need it anymore. It was completely useless for us, and I don't see how it would help a child learn to walk. If you're dead set on getting a walker, I'd go for a more expensive wooden one that will do it's job. But either way, you're child will learn to walk before you know it without the help of anything... so save the money for child-proofing everything once they get going!"
1,Do Not Buy This,"I really didn't like this toy. It is nonfunctioning as both a walking toy and a riding one. As a walker, there isn't enough room for a child's feet when they are walking with it in front of them. As a rider and walker, it doesn't roll very well. I just didn't like this at all. It also doesn't have as many activities on it as many other walking and riding toys. I would not recommend anyone buy this."
5,This is GREAT,"My son (now 3 1/2) got this toy for Christmas right after he turned one. We didn't use the walker part of it as much, but the car part of it is wonderful. My son still plays on it ALL the time (well til he went to his dad's and I throw it out cause it was too dirty to clean). I would buy it for my 8 month old. It's wonderful and lasts a long time."
4,Helped my son be independent,"I don't remember exactly when I got this ""Walk n' Ride"" toy for my son. (It was the only walker I saw at Target that day.) My son was cruising by 8 months and took his first steps at 10.5 months. He loved the walker the first time he tried it. I do remember that at first the toy was rolling too fast for him to catch up. He also fell a lot when leaning on it too much or from the sides. But he was only just learning to walk. (A reminder to parents: infants should be supervised and assisted when using *any* walker in the early stages of walking. Same goes for teaching kids to ride a bike, right?) Once my son gained enough strength and coordination in his legs & feet to manuever the walker on the carpet without falling too much I let him go with it on our tile floors. Needless to say, he was running everywhere with this toy by 13 months. He still prefers it as a walker/runner now that he's 15 months. I don't know if he'll ever use it to ride on, though."
3,"Liked it, but didn't love it","My son was 11 months old when we bought this rider for him. He was creeping but not independently walking, so we thought he would enjoy the increased stability from the walker mode. The base is too narrow for him to walk behind it while holding on to the handle. Consequently, he often just stood next to it. He is now 15 months old and he does enjoy climbing on and off the seat although he hasn't figured out how to move it while sitting on it. Also, the change from walker to rider isn't the easiest, but once you figure it out, it's not a problem."
2,moderately entertaining,"Our son showed no interest in this toy as he was learning to walk. He much preferred cruising with furniture. Now that he is fully walking, he occasionally pushes the cart around, but still doesn't enjoy sitting on it as a car. I don't think its a particularly bad toy, its sturdy, colorful, and does what it is suppose to do. It was just something my son wasn't excited about."
3,"Cute, Durable, but a PAIN to put together",This is a cute walk 'n ride toy and it seems durable. It was SUCH A PAIN to put it together though. Instructions were clear it was just hard to cnap pieces into where they belong. I hurt my hand doing it and I'm not an idiot that can't put things together (we are IKEA experts in our house). My 10 month old seems to like it and she has already been pulling herself up on and and trying to take a few steps with it in the walk mode. She has no idea what to do with it in the ride mode but there are a few fun things to do on it. It's not an activity toy as much as it is for walking/riding so it might not keep your abby occupied unless she/he is pulling up on it and using it for that purpose. But my daughter is finding that great fun so far. I guess it's worth the trouble of putting it together. HAve fun!
4,"Great colors, keeps interest.","My 10 month old daughter likes this toy. She got it for christmas and the colors will catch her eye from across the room and she will go for it. the rattle sounds, things to pull and pop back cracks her up.One thing, it doesn't hold her little weight when pulling up on it, but she's getting the hang of it."
3,My daughter didn't care for it,"My daughter got this when she was about 10 months old. She likes to spin the little toys that are on the buggy, but has never used it for its intended purpose. She was completely uninterested in walking behind it, and now that she is a confident walker she is still apathetic about riding on it as a buggy. It is a little too short for her anyway.I think this toy was a waste of money for us, as most of the time she'd just flip it over and look at the underside of it. I'd recommend looking for a taller ride-on toy that will last your child longer."
1,Read this review!,"I would not recommend this walker. Although it is quite durable, I gave it a low rating in all categories since I would not recommend it to anyone. The biggest problem is that the base where a baby walks behind it is too narrow. It tips over so easily. My son is quite sturdy on his feet now and constantly trips on it. He has decided that it is easier to walk beside it and pull it along. Several of my friends also have it and have the same opinion. One friend is an early child development specialist and also dislikes it. We purchased an another one (after seeing our son fly across the room with other walkers that belonged to friends' babies) by Fisher Price. He loves his new one (wider base and all four wheels in line with each other). The multi-use functionality of the Playshool one is attractive, but not worth the money (or bumps and bruises!)."
3,Not quite what I expected.....,"We got this toy on sale from Wal-Mart for $[...] and I'm glad we didn't pay more. This was a christmas gift for my 15 month old daughter and I was a little worried cause we got her another ""ride on"" toy for $50. The Walk n' Ride isn't as substantial as I expected (don't know what I was expecting for $[...]). My daughter can't ride it cause it's too low to the ground, and the wheels aren't quality made so when she puts her weight on it, it's hard for her to push (she's thin, in the 30% for weight). She can push it around in the standing position and does play with the on board toys but they don't hold her interest for too long. For $[...] I can't knock it, but it's not what I'd call a great toy.She MUCH prefers her other ride on toy which I can't find online, otherwise I'd recommend it."
2,not good for riding,"The fun parts of the toy are the clicky toys on it and the trunk.It's not good for a new walker because it pushes too easily and runs away from the slowly walking kid, who then falls.It's not good for riding because the back wheels stick out too far. The kid's feet hit/get run over by the back wheels. My kid can only get it to go backwards. Older kids can ride it, but it's pretty low to the ground for them.We've had it 3 years and it's durable. Nothing's broken off and the locking mechanism between walker/rider function is still reliable. My 1st kid never cared, but now that the 2nd really wants to ride it I'm going to buy a different one."
2,Not Sturdy for Beginners,"I bought this for my daughter at 9 mos. She was already pulling up and cruising on furniture. I thought this would be helpful for her to get around the other areas of the house with my help. Unfortunately, it's very unsturdy and the wheels go quickly. There isn't any resistance for beginning walkers, so they will lean on the walker and it will shoot forward. I thought using it on the carpet (rather than our wood floors) might help, but no difference.By reading the description, it sounds like a great transition toy. I think you should save the money and just use an overturned box or laundry basket. Same effect.The only upside is that she enjoys the car mode when I push her. Perhaps she will grow into this toy once she walks independently. However, I think that defeats the purpose and description of this toy. It'll sit and gather dust until she wants to ride on it."
3,OPPS THE SEAT,"MY 1YR.OLD SON LOVES HIS WALK'N'RIDE TOY BUT , I'VE FOUND THAT EVEN WHEN HE COULD NOT WALK THE SEAT IS TO CLOSE TO THE HANDLE BAR.. NOW THAT HE CAN WALK HE LOVES TO PUSH IT. I THINK THAT WE GOT MORE USE FOR A PUSH TOY AND NOT A RIDE ON."
2,Needs improvement,Bought this for my son when he was starting to learn to walk. When it is in the up position for use as a walker it wasn't as stable as we hoped for and it kept falling over. The other thing we did not like was the wheels on this were stiff and did not roll easily when he would sit on it and push with his feet. When we have our second child we will buy the other one that we looked at when we decided on this.MRC 06-21-02
1,Don't waste your money,"We got this as a gift, and I originally thought the concept was cute, however it is too difficult for my kids to use. I have a 1 year old as well as a 2 year old and they both get frustrated with this toy. When it is in the bicycle position, it is too low to the ground and almost impossible for them to move. The wheels don't turn, they just slide. They only like it when I push them because it is too hard for them to do themselves (but this gets too tiring for me)."
3,"Great on carpet, Not so much on wood floors",I bought this for my 9 month old child since they are starting to climb on everything and I figured that this would be a good way for them to practice walking. Unfortunately the wheels are very slick and the toy just slides around on hardwood floors.
2,Not as good as it looks and sounds,"We bought it for our son, and I must say, kid does not like it at all. You have to make sure baby does not twist his/her ankle."
1,"Dangerous as a walker, too small as a rider","Our now 10 month old got this toy for Christmas, and it looked fun at first. However, once he was at point when he was mobile and pulling up on things to ""cruise"", he kept trying to walk with this and it kept flipping back. It is just very lightweight and doesn't really support leaning on the handle. Also, the wheels don't turn very well, more like slide. So, it definitely would be better on carpet than hardwood, but still not good. After falling once and bumping his head, and then falling a second time and having the toy hit him in the mouth, we gave up. As a ride on, it is safer, but it is pretty small. Our 10 month old is pushing the limits (he's on the average to small side). A disappointment."
2,"Practico y funcional, pero no es lo que esperaba.","I do not recommend this walker for children who are taking their first steps, as the wheels are nothing stable, and we want to trust something that our children do not scare him. about the apparently very nice and bright colors but not what I expected, is very small ...."
1,The Wheels are wayyy too slippery on wood floor and carpet,i bought this because i liked the two in one. its great for the riding part. but as a walker.. not so much. it's wayyyyy too slippery. i have wood floor and carpet. my 10month old cant use it as a walker. now i have to find another one
1,Playskool Walk 'N Ride,"I am not impressed my this toy... Here are the negatives: the wheel base is to narrow, it is top heavy and can turn over very easily, the front and back wheels are fixed and do not move from side to side-it is hard for the child to turn, the wheels are to slick and it makes the ""walker"" move to quickly for a little one who is learning how to walk. Also, the handle bar is very low-making it hard for a taller baby to use. I would recommend finding a better product to purchase-even through this is a brand name toy, there are much better ones on the market."
4,Surprised me!,"I bought this toy for my son's 1 year birthday. Oh lord, I had no clue he would love it so much. He just loves the fact that he can take off and walk all around the house with it which is something that he cannot do otherwise. He doesn't play with the toys on the front of it at all but that's no big deal.I wouldn't recommend this toy for a child who doesn't know how to keep himself balanced since putting their body weight on the handle will most likely send it shooting forward unexpectedly. My son has never fallen with it but I also waited until he was pretty well balanced. He only uses this toy as a little boost for his confidence. I truly feel like it was the best gift for him at this stage, he instantly became more independent! Simple and yet effective! We only tried the ride on mode 1 time and I felt like he didn't really know what to do so I switched it back to the walker mode. I paid $15 for it (at Kohl's) and it was worth every single penny."
3,Not thrilled with it,"I bought this months ago thinking my child would ride on it and then grow into the walker part. My child is 12 months old and it's still not used except for spinning the green roller or playing with the other toys that move. My child is tall for his age and when he sits on it like a car, he has no clue what to do and just sits there. His legs are really too long and bunched up to make it move anyway. I can't push him in it because his legs get tangled underneath him. It also doesn't move well on carpet. Now we try it as a walk-behind, as my child is just starting to get interested, but he takes about two steps and gets distracted with that green spinning roller and sits down to play with the attachments.I wouldn't buy it again as it just didn't do what I thought it would."
2,Getting rid of this toy today,"My baby received this toy as a gift, even though it's a good looking toy, I am concern about my baby's safety, He doesn't walk yet, so I used it in the sitting mode, today my baby was riding it and he tried to reach the front toys, in a flash the car roll over itself getting upside down, my baby's forehead went straight to the floor, thanks God our floor is carpeted and he was far away from furniture. If it wasn't for the carpet my son would have a big bump on his head. I was happy with this toy before this happened but I am not let my baby to play with it anymore."
2,My son loved it....till he got hurt.,"I got this for my son for christmas. He wasn't yet walking so I thought it would be a good toy for him. I was wrong. Time after time (till the next day when I took it away from him) he was getting hurt on it. Sitting on it as a ""car"", he flipped in it and hit his head hard on the floor. Standing and pushing it...flipped it and fell! I mean, how will kids learn to walk with this thing if all it does is hurt them?-------Mind Scarring Storiesavailable now."
2,AWFUL WALKER-REALLY UNSTURDY,"This was scary for me watching my just learning to walk baby tip back & fourth while trying to push this on tile. She had also had a Fisher Price Hippo that was sturdy & wonderfull as pre-walker in comparison and less harrowing to watch her play with. not ideal if you want it for a pre-walker I also read that kids even just riding this thing when reaching over front into trunk can tip it over. Really unsturdy toy; my daughter did like the trunk too, I'm just greatful she never tried to reach for it while in the drivers seat; I don't even want to imagine a head first on tile floors."
2,not good for its intended purpose,"First the good. This walker is very brightly colored and my son loves to play with all of the gadgets and hide blocks under the hood. It will do very well when he's old enough to use it as a riding toy. As a walker, it fails miserably. It's far too light and the wheels give no resistance so the second my son tries to use it to stand up, it falls over backwards on top of him. If I help him stand up and grab the handle, it flies out from under him the second he takes a step. It's not a complete waste of money. It's inexpensive and he plays with all of the toys on it, but as a walking aid, it's useless."
2,Not a good walker. My daughter trips over it constantly.,"The design of this walker is awful. For a toy built to assist a baby starting to walk should be designed so the baby doesn't trip over the very thing that is supposed to assist them! The bottom wheels come out so far that as the baby holds on to the handle, the legs constantly gets tangled with the wheels. I don't know why the wheels have to come out so far. As for the car version, it works fine. But used as a walker, it is terrible."
1,Terrible design: assembled it and my son can't even use it,"Don't buy this toy unless you want to waste your money!!My husband-to-be assembled this toy and my son was so excited. The moment my son sat on it we knew we'd been scammed out of the money we paid for it. The main problem is the back end is too wide. The wide back end interferes with the backward movement of his legs and therefore there was no way he can propel the scooter forward. The narrow front seat with wide back end is a major design flaw and I find it hard to believe that this toy made it out of the design and testing stages at Hasbro Playskool.Additional problems: The wheels are extremely slippery plastic; it rides too low to the ground, and once assembled it cannot be disassembled, placed back into the box and returned to the store for a refund!"
4,very cute toy,"This toy is great for entertainment, i love the riding part and the cute little things on it.I don't trust this thing as someone that is just trying to walk because it rolls ahead so fast.I would recomend it we have had it for 2 1/2 years now and my son still plays with it!"
3,"nice concept, but could use some improvements","I really like the walk n ride concept, but there are a few things that could definitely be improved on this product. For one, the wheels in the rear are too close together, so your little one really doesn't have enough room to step forward, without kicking the wheels. Also, when sitting, the wheels in the front get in the way of the child trying to move their legs forward. It is nice and low to the ground, which I like - alot of the riding toys are too high up. It's so so, I would shop around for another. We accumulated about 5 walking/riding toys before we found the right one that fit our daughter - the little tykes riding toy (it's pink and blue, I'm not sure what the name of the model is - they make a red/blue one too for boys)."
2,Unsafe,"My 10 month old needed another walker to help him get around and he has only found disappointment in this non-sturdy, dangerous toy. The antenna points straight to the childs eye when it is in walker mode and it tips over so easily, we put the toy away until it could be hopefully used as a scooter in 6 months. Not worth [the money]."
2,Too easy to pull over,"This toy is ok for one to ride on, but didn't really work too well for walking with. The problem is it fell over when my son put too much weight while trying to walk, he tried to pull up using it a few times and it fell on him. As a result it was never really used for walking which was what I bought it for."
4,"Good toy, but fit only for carpet areas!","My daughter took a long time to find the necessary confidence to walk. She cruised for a really long time and this was a great toy to help her gain confidence to finally take her first independent steps. She rarely used it as a bike, though (but turning it from walker to bike is pretty easy). But, beware: this is a carpet only walker. The wheels have no friction on the floor and on wooden areas it can be pretty dangerous, moving way too fast for a baby. In hardwood floors, it is an accident waiting to happen. A huge rug in my living area - the rest of the house is carpeted - solved the problem."
3,Walk and Ride,"I bought this walker for my son when he was nine months old. He loved playing with all the gadgets on the front of it. He is now almost 11 months old and still has trouble walking with it. I do not consider this to be a very safe walker. He has fallen on either side of it and on his face. The handle is small and hard for him to hang on to and the base is small so he tries to walk with one foot inside and one outside, it also rocks when he tries to pull himself up on it. I feel okay with him walking on the plush carpet but do not trust it on our tile floors, the wheels slide out in front of him very fast. He likes riding on it when we push him so it is a fun toy for him just not a stable walker."
5,The trunk is the key!,"Although it is a great walker for learners, the trunk is the most fascinating thing for my son - he puts things in, closes the door and takes then out again. When in an upright position, my son will cruise back and forth across the family room. I have noticed it can tip if he is not directly in back of the handlebars but we are always there to straighten him out anyway. He likes to ride on the car but has not figured out how to get his feet out of the way unless we hold them up for him. I recommend this toy to help new walkers but as with all toys, you should always supervise. My 11 month old son just loves it and he is walking on his own now!"
1,this toy is not safe,"I HAVE A 9 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER WHO IS STARTING TO WALK ON HER OWN, SO I BOUGHT HER THIS TOY THINKING IT WOULD HELP HER WITH HER WALKING. AFTER PLAYING WITH THIS TOY FOR NOT EVEN FIVE MINUTES SHE FELL BACKWARDS AND HIT HER CHIN ON THE HANDLE. AFTER CALMING HER DOWN SHE WANTED TO PLAY WITH IT AGAIN, SO I LET HER AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN. NOW I ONLY LET HER USE IT AS A RIDE ON TOY. IN MY OPINION I DO NOT THINK THE TOY IS WORTH BUYING."
5,This is Great,This toy is great. My daughter loved this. She walked holding onto it and then she loved to ride on it. She liked to put things in the trunk and so did her older brother and sister. They would play hide the little hot whell car and they almost always used that little trunk on the car. This is another great toy from Playskool!!!
2,"some good, some bad","The attachments are of great interest to my son, but this toy isn't a big help as far as mobility goes. When he was first starting to walk, he would hold on to the handle, and if he fell at all and didn't let go of the handle, the toy easily tipped on top of him. Now that he is older (18 months), he is bored with the stroller aspect of it. We never did find a time that it seemed appropriate for him. As a sit-on toy, it is REALLY hard for a toddler to move with their legs. The wheels do not roll too easily at all."
4,Mom of 2 yr old and baby on the way,This is a fun toy for very young children who are learning how to walk. It is neat because it is a walker and a sit down scooter. It is not great if you have large children as I have. My son had a blast with this for a couple of months but quickly outgrew it. By 14-16 months he was way too tall for it and the seat was too small. It is really sturdy so I keep it for our friends kids to play with.
3,My experience,"I actually bought this at a garage sale. It was a great walker for my son however, he was already taking steps unassisted when we got it. Nowdays, he's only interested in riding it as a bike and that silly blue stick on the back frustrates him to tears. He gets his leg stuck and screams bloody murder!"
3,"""Skill Builder Scooter""","We found this ride-on truck at a garage sale. The owner's son refused to ride it. But my daughters took to it immediately. There are two positions: upright for babies to boost themselves from crawling to standing to motoring, and horizontal for riding. Positives: bright primary colors will attract your child to the blue and orange spinner, the purple lever, the green wheel with three sets of silly eyes, the round orange dial with finger grooves that makes a clacking noise when turned, and the green storage compartment. Negatives: it took much effort to adjust between the two levels. The blue flexible antenna broke off easily. We have a popping ice cream truck ride-on than my girls like better."
3,Not much of a walker...,"I bought this toy for our first son when he was beginning to walk. He never used it as a walker. He didn't like using it, plus it doesn't give any walking room, he would just hit his feet on it...not the best thing when they are trying to learn how to walk. On the other hand, it has been a great ride-on toy. My son is no 2.5 years old and he still loves his car."
4,"Great for walking, not so great for riding","My parents got this for my daughter at Christmas, she was 8 months old. She just played with the gizmos for a couple of months, and used it in pusher mode to help her stand. In just 2 short months, however, she learned to push it around and she was walking on her own well before her 1st birthday. HOWEVER, this toy is a terrible ride-on. It's too wide to allow the babies to move their feet...more like just a sit-on. Oh, and the ""antenna"" is in the way for babies to swing their leg over the seat to get on or off. My daughter tried dozens of times and I always had to help her on and off. We just keep it in walker mode now and I am looking for another ride-on."
1,"Unstable, poorly-made","Was hoping for a product that would give my kid a sense of security while taking his first steps. When assembled, the parts were still shaky. It rolls before my kid could haul himself up with the handles, making him shy away from trying it any further. As a push-toy, the seat is quite small, and the back handles make it uncofortable. Ended up returning it since he only played with the rattlers in front."
2,Not for children who learn to walk,"I bought this for my 10-month old then. She liked to ride on it, but that's about it. She's one now and she's learning to walk. I can see her push this as she walks if she already masters that skill. However, if she's to push this thing now as she learns to walk, the thing is too light and will just go so easily and she will fall down and that really worries me. So, I always have it on a ride position because she is trying to pull up and push it and fall down. So, definitely not for beginner walker."
2,havent used it enough yet,It is not stable enough for an 8 month old to begin getting up and that is what I thought it was for. They should have added a lock feature. Honestly we haven't had the chance to use it but a few times and the only thing he can do is spin the toy. He may play with when he can already stand alone.
4,Great two in one toy,"We purchased this toy for our daughter as a Christmas present. She was only 8 months at the time, so we were guessing it was a toy she would be growing into. However, she loved it right away. It was the first toy we put together (very easily) that morning, and we sat her on top, in the ride position, she squealed with delight. She watched most of the rest of Christmas morning from atop her new car. She isn't able to scoot herself forward yet, only backwards, but she likes to be pushed forward. I'll admit, we haven't used it much as a walker, but I like that it has this option for when she gets to that point. Surprisingly, she also likes to just sit on the floor next to the toy and play with all the extra gadgets. She did pull the hood cover off once, so that has been my only concern."
4,Great product!,"Wonderful, my nephew loved this item, he hops on it and plays with all the different things, lots of fun. Would recommend for a 1 yr old."
5,perfect for us!,This inexpensive walker has been working out great for us. My one year old son has been using it for a month now and has perfected trotting behind it on our wood floors with no problem at all. We did start out on carpet before he could keep up with it. He loves the toys and with his shorter legs has no problem scooting along in the sit down/car mode. I think he will still be interested for a few more months. No batteries or major bells and whistles. It's just right for us!
2,Looks cute and that's about it!,My daughter pays no attention to this toy what so ever. She can't walk with it becuase it either falls apart or it trips her. I'm just not all that impressed.
1,I dont like it at all,"I personally dont like this toy at all, it is very hard for my son to use, and he is always kicking the blue part that they walk in between. It tips *very* easy and is not good for a baby just starting out."
1,doesn't work,The product does not work as a walker. My 10 month old kept kicking the base. She could not use it. When we converted it to a ride on toy she could not reach the floor and by the time she could reach the floor it was too small to ride. I think there are many better options out there. It may be worth it to but a seperate walker and ride on toy. I wish I had done that.
2,"No, no and no!","Alice is very different in this book. She does not think and is weird. I think if you want a good book, read another Alice book. Or Harry Potter. Alice wears her hair in green spikes, and disobeys her father. If you want a good book, DO NOT I repeat DO NOT read this book."
3,";( I love Mrs. Naylor, but this book was surprisingly bad","I think the rest of the ""Alice"" books are REALLY good, and very funny, but this book was not. It was okay, but nothing more. I don't regret reading it 'cause I've read all the books in the series, and don't want to miss out on anything. This book just was not as satisfying as the other books in the series. I've talked (for a very short time!) on the phone (I can't believe her number was listed!)with Phyllis Reynolds Naylor before (I think in '94...), and I'm a really big fan of hers. ""Outrageously Alice"" was probably the only book of her's that I wouldn't give a 10. But read it anyway if you like the ""Alice"" books, because it's not that bad, just not great"
2,Not appropriate for 9 and 10 year olds,"This book is listed for readers age 9-13. However, it is most inapprpriate for preteen readers. Alice learns about ""sensual experiences in a swimming pool"" and what to do with whipped cream besides putting it on a dessert. This book was donated to my 4th grade classroom library. I assumed it would be appropriate based on Mrs. Naylors other works. Boy was I surprised when a parent brought it to my attention. Strictly for Jr. High and up."
2,Nothing new!,"I should've read the description before I bought it because they're just the same exact songs from the Celts! What a waste of money.Oh well...good thing I bought it for less than a dollar! I could've bought a candy bar with that money, lolBut seriously, this CD should never have been released because it's the exact thing like the Celts except it has a different cover/design!SO WHAT!!! I suppose it could be for people that like black and white pictures and the Celts for those that like colored pics, LOL! I don't know!So save yourself the time and money and DON'T BUT THIS CD if you already own the Celts!But if you already own this CD but not the Celts then don't buy the Celts!You don't need both! One or the other!"
5,This was great.,"Why don't other people appreciate this video? It's not as if the creaters had 10 million dollers to make expensive computer animations or anything. I like the minimilistic animations and I loved the music that went with them. I learned a lot from the documentary, and now I am going to go and buy the bookstore out of Philip K. Dick books."
1,Interesting. But not interesting enough,"This video is a shallow and only vaguely interesting study on the life of a fantastic writer. Interviews make up the majority of the content and are mostly people telling their opinions of the man. The beginning of each segment of interview is marked by a stupid animation of a cartoon-PKD typing out little tidbits of trivia. I got the distinct impression that these little cartoons are only in the movie to add length, as each instance of the cartoon is exactly identical. I also though the music was cheesy and annoying. Overall, if the cartoons were taken out. A couple of the more pointless segments were taken out (who cares about the PKD section of the So. Cal. library?!) you would be left with a short, mildly interesting documentary. As it is currently a long, annoying and (in my opinion) intolerable documentary."
2,"World of Philip K. Dick fascinating, but not this DVD","The Gospel According to Philip K. Dick explores some of this fascinating man's life and works, but ultimately fails at being an interesting movie. The interviews are okay, but there's nothing here that can't be found elsewhere where you can learn more. The often repetitious animation of PKD mouthing his actual dialogue gets to be grating and the audio isn't very clear either. An old fan of PKD will be bored watching this, a new fan might get interested enough to pursue other biographies and want to read more of his works."
1,Do Not Buy This DVD,"Philip K. Dick fans will find nothing new or interesting in this documentary. People unfamiliar with PKD will not learn anything about him. About 85% of this documentary is garbage. The other 15% is merely boring. Read the other reviews to learn more about the repetitive use of animation. Not worth owning, even for free."
1,Just re-read the stories and watch the movies,"I bought this (without reading the reviews) because I thought it would provide some real context to the genius whose work spawned so many excellent movies, but was I ever disappointed.I read PKD's stories back when he was alive, and was hoping for some insight into how his mindset influenced his work. There was very little of that. This was a movie that cried out for some critical synopis of Dick's work, and should have tied his eccentricities or psychosis to his output. Instead, we are left with reminicences, some of which are interesting, but very little insight into this artist. A big disappointment--even for a fan."
4,How do I know?,"Some voice inside of me seems to already know how each event of my life should go, critiquing relentlessly as though it has been here before. This book is a powerful step toward disarming the authority of that voice."
5,ann g a true diva,"this is one of the best albums that came out in the 90's ann g is not only beautiful but this woman can sing, write and produce i love this album it is timeless and classic"
4,Good Girls Wear Black,"I just received my Anne G CD today and I am definitely glad I made the purchase. I have this album on cassette that I purchased back in 1989, and I would play it quite a bit (especially the song ""If She Knew""). Although I remember the album for the most part, I didn't quite appreciate that Anne G wrote, arranged and produced most of the tracks. Not only is Anne G fine in black, she is a very talented woman. The song ""Love's Here"" is truly a gem! I highly recommend the purchase of the CD for anyone that appreciated the late 80's & early 90's New Jack Swing scene, but also appreciates a talented female artist such as Anne G! Also need to mention that the price for this CD was a deal!"
1,I Really Love This Book So Much I Had To Knock Out The Critical Review That Preceded Mine,"This book is wonderful. Please read all the other positive reviews. You will enjoy the words and pictures. And if you like turtles, you will be extra happy."
4,very sweet,"Its a great bedtime story...my five year old loves that she know what to say to finish the phrase "" I‘m coming mama"""
2,Cute idea for a book,"The book starts out cute, then gets a little out there and repetitive. Kind of wish I hadn't spent the money. I think there are better books out there."
5,Follow the Moon,I read this to my boys. They loved the graphics and how cute the turtles were. The story is super cute! Very entertaining.
4,My daughter loved it!,"My daughter loved the turtle. The illustrations are great! She said, ""mom if im ever lost ill follow the moon and find you."""
3,Really long,"Got for my 22 month old. Didn't hold either or our attention, and maybe it will in the future, but it was excessively repetitive. 79 pages is just a lot. It does accurately show a turtles journey, but other books are shorter."
3,Not for Kindle,"Cute story and beautiful pictures but not compatible as a Kindle book at all. Even on my 10in tablet, it's unreadable as a book, unless you want to stop and select the page to zoom in, then X out, then select the next page, zoom out, swipe, and then start all over. Def. not a pleasant reading experience."
2,"Great pictures, lame story","My son loves turtles and books so I didnt think I could go wrong with this. The concept is cute, but its the same line page after page and a bunch of jibber jabber. If youre thinking it was going to be a baby turtle on a journey like I did...then dont buy this book. The illustrations are awesome, but the wording is repetitive and no real content."
3,Okay,"Definitely not a.favorite, Good but good to spark curiosity,and lead into sea turtle study. Pretty illustrations. Now to find some sea turtle hatching videos."
2,"Cute story, but","This is a cute story; however it is so basic that my 5 year old lost interest after the first couple of pages. She is an avid reader and usually loves stories with a repetative line, but this one just didn't do the trick. I think the book could have been shorten a great deal and it would have been much stronger."
5,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful story, with sweet illustrations. My 5 year-old loved the story, and I loved the way the words were printed on the page, which was also a way to ""read"" it."
1,Get your facts straight,"I volunteer for a local turtle watch group in my area so I know a little about turtles. The one main thing is that the mother turtle lays her eggs and leaves. She never ""reunites"" with her babies. I feel it is totally a lie to tell my child this story. While it's nice to think of them as nurturing etc, they are not. Why anyone would have their entire book based on such a ridiculous premise is beyond me. I can't even say it's a sweet book, although I want to, being that it's based on such an untrue idea, it tarnishes the rest of the book. I would recommend Gail Gibbons book ""Sea Turtles"" for a more factual read, although not quite as endearing of a story. I am so dissappointed in this book."
3,okay read,"The pics were nice, but this read was not a good one. My 6 year old thought the sentences were ""weird"". We didn't enjoy this there wasn't a good flow to the writing. My 4 and 2 year olds enjoyed the redundant wording in the other sentences maybe because I added special voices to help make this more interesting."
3,It's a seaturtle book,"My little 5-year-old girl that loves turtles likes this book. It didn't do much for me, but then again it is a kid's book."
2,Terrible.......,I really do not like the songs on this cd.They are rap and R and B all the way. I HATE IT!

5,I never even heard a Pastor describe Prayer Like this!,"This is truly a wonderful book. In all my years of listening to preachers I never expected to be reading a book by someone who is quote, unquote not religious but KNOWS more about true prayer than any Pastor I have ever heard. If you need to revitalize that part of your life in your heart that has been missing for so long, I highly suggest you start here. You won't be dissapointed. VT NY"
5,The Answer,This book gives you the answer to your problems. I would also recommend the book An Encounter with A Prophet as a companion book.
4,Ghost Hunters pick,"I love the show Ghost hunters, and while visiting there site I saw this book as there book of the month, so I thought it would be good and it was.I liked how the investigaters where not jumping to conclusions and they thoughly investegated the home. It was not scary but it was interesting and entertaning."
1,Dread and the Dead Filled the Dunnam House,There is nothing wrong with the content of this book. Poor editing is a constant distraction and a bit frustrating as the grammar and sentence structure leaves a lot to be desired.
5,A Must Read!,"This is a book you can't put down until your finished, it's a true encounter of what a family in Florida had to go through with the supernatural. If you into the paranormal or Ghost's this is the book for you! A MUST READ!"
4,Fantastic,"I think this book was a very nice description of a man's life. There's always something happening, and that contributes to the fact that this book is never boring. That's why I like this book. Roald Dahl is right when he says that it's not an autobiography. I don't know what makes it different, but there is something, that's for sure.The way he describes his family is very nice. You can almost sense the love between all of them. That's another positive thing about the book.I also learned allot about how life was like in ` the old days `. Among many other things, I was quite surprised by the way the kids were treated at school.I liked this book very much, and I would recommend it to others. Both kids and grown- ups."
4,Very informative,"This is a great book for writers, as it is very detailed when discussing procedures and people who deal with death everyday - coroners, medical examiners, funeral directors, gravediggers, etc. It also has an extensive index and even photographs of death certificates and such. I had hoped there would be more detail on actual corpses and decomposition (hey -when you need to describe a dead body in a story, this info is crucial!) But to find out the difference between wet and dry rot, drowning victims in cold, or warm climates, etc. you'll need another book. This volume is expensive and a bit of work to track down, but well worth the price, as its about as fascinating a book on death you're likely to find."
3,NOT QUITE WHAT I EXPECTED,"Some of the book was interesting; the other parts were disappointing. I'd have liked to see real photos to accompany the explanations--not that I'm into ""gory"" things, but it would make more sense from a scientific standpoint.Also, parts of the book were a little juvenile: ""What is a cemetery""? Who doesn't know that?There were still unanswered questions and also parts of the book that contradicted themselves. I did expect more from this."
5,Absolutely spell-binding and extremely comprehensive.,"""Death to Dust"" is one of the most interesting books I've ever read, and the comprehensiveness is part of the attraction. From the normal (what happens after death) to the unusual (shrunken heads), it's all there. Legal matters associated with death--they're there too. Appendices, glossary, and index--check. Pages are even included for a nifty ""Body-Disposal Instructions and Discussion Guide,"" which the reader can use to help record his or her own preferences about funeral, body donation, notifications, costs, and information like lawyer, insurance, and executor.Although the book is about death, it's not dull, drab, or depressing. In fact, humor is all over the place. I highly recommend this book for everything you might want to know about death, dead bodies, or the death industry; I had always wondered about such things but never had any luck finding someone who knew the answers. This one's definitely a keeper!!"
2,Confused,I'm confused by the subject matter of his book. In the story the skunk has to decide what's more important...friendship or a meal. I don't think children can relate to this situation at all. How many children view their friends as edible?
1,RealReader,A Radical Incarnation:(YOURS)I really wanted to like this book but didn't. I would not have given it as many stars as other did. I only gave it one.
1,"Edna St. Vincent Millay ""Journey Through life"" VHS","Since Amazon does not give a detailed description of this video I thought it would be a good idea to do so. It is NOT a video about the life of poet Edna St. Vincent Millay as the title might lead you to believe but instead it's a bad production with Valerie Harper and some other actresses reciting some of Millay's poems and text from her plays. To be honest you are better off reading Millay's poems yourself than getting this video. However, if you are looking for an interesting video on Millay's life get the ""Millay at Steepletop"" VHS."
2,A bust,"My kitten loves ball-like toys and plush, but she pays no attention to these. I got one out the day they arrived, and it is still sitting on the floor where i left it. They are smaller than I thought, and the center is hard. Shouldn't have bought such a big quantity without testing one first."
3,Not real fur?,"I used to get fur strips for my cats from PetsMart, but they stopped carrying real fur toys and I've had a hard time finding anywhere that does- my cats won't touch the polyester ones. When I got these, my cats played with them for a few minutes, but haven't played with them much since then. I guess they're not real fur, since the package says they're ""Made lightweight with extra fluffy, furry texture."" They feel a lot like the real thing to me, but apparently my cats don't agree."
2,Product not the same quality as before : (,"I have purchased these fur ball toys for my two cats several times in the past and have been very satisfied with the quality of the product. This last batch was of poor quality and some of the fur balls were already falling apart. Despite the cheap construction of the fur balls, they are still the favorite toys amongst the cats."
2,Depends on the Cat,"I hate rating this so low because it may work for some, but I have tried these on four cats and none of them cared. They were only interesting when I put catnip on them. most of the time they've been shoved against the wall and forgotten, even when I try to bring them out to play. I ended up taking them to the Humane Society. If it brings joy to at least one cat's life I'll be happy."
3,OK for Kids and Light Use,"This product the Caravelle 300 looks great, but compared to similar sized INTEX inflatable, it falls short. Neither has TWO Boston Valves, one for each main hull cell, as larger models do. They should have two. Sevylor has thinner vinyl. 16 gauge vs 22-23 for Intex. And moreso, the main seam around the hull looks weaker. The Intex has a major 1/4 inch wide weld all around the hull perimeter. Sevylor has only a 1/16 inch weld bead around the hull. May be adequate but why take the chance? And the 200 series is fine for an adult and 1 child, but not two adults. The 300 is minimum size for two adults."
3,Picture doesn't fit,The picture is not the boat that was sent to us. That boat has 4 handles our boat only has two handles.
4,Very nice...but not as described....,"We ordered this for our children to use in our pool. It is very sturdy. Easily fits 3 children, ages 11 to 14. Seems to be well constructed. We are pleased in every way but one: the descriptiopn says that ""small foot pump and oars"" are included. They are not. You will need a pump of some sort to inflate this. Other than this, we would have given this product five stars."
3,Boring Police Tell,"Good luck and patience to watch to the end this police story of solving the 12-old girl murdering and own personal problems, -a boring, grey, typically UK miseriae production by creating theQueer as Folkso much afterwards beautified with the US re-mastering."
4,The Definitive House-Music Group,"Just a quickie review -- if you're here, you probably know what Snap! is about. If not, they were at the forefront of revolutionizing dance/house music in the late 80's/early 90's.A good deal of the music here has stood the test of a decade, continues to sound great, and continues to be danceable. This album is a near must-have for anyone who enjoyed a great house party when Snap! was hot. (The remixes aren't bad, either.)"
4,"A mysterious story, not knowing what will happen next.",This is a good book by Christopher Pike. I could not put this book down after I started to read it. It takes place in L.A. California. It is a good book for people who like mysteries. It has a group of teenagers that are seniors in high school. Some person wrote a chain letter about how he knew that the teenagers buried someone last summer. The teenagers were trying to figure out who wrote the chain letter.
4,Its not what you think.....,"Your supposed to think chain letter is about some evil curseor a demon out to kill.....but its not. I really suggest this book for more people who enjoy a more of a fictious plot, but not some monster risen from the dead plot. everything in this book could of happened."
3,Cliché,"Chain Letter was ok...but not near Chris's bests. I mean, it was sorta like one of those teen slasher movies or something! it was a good horror book, but it wasn't very substantial. i actually didnt get very ""into"" the book, I just read it when i was bored. I'd say save this book for an airplane ride."
3,they did't realize how much trouble they were in.,"in this book the characters are a group of friends who are in the desert one evening driving. then they hit this man, who was walking on the side of the rode. they then burried him in the area that they hit him at. now about a year has passed and they recieve a letter. in the letter it has deeds that each person has to complete or something tragic will happen."
3,pretty good,"This book is about 6 friends who kill a man by accident. They are sent a chainletter that says they have to complete the task assigned and pass it on to the next person in the group. You learn about the story from a boy and girl in the group who you know aren't the caretaker. The story moves on as they try to figure out who the caretaker is, even suspecting each other. In the end, it turns out to be the least person you would expect. I wouldn't call it Pike's best book but you probaly shouldn't pass it up."
4,very suspenseful with a surprise ending- sooo good!!,"Christopher Pike is a very talented author whose work I love to read. He never leaks any information to give away the ending of the story. I was interested to see that this story had no sci-fi related matter in it, perhaps the sequel will...but I haven't read it yet. I loved how he made you believe at one point in the story or another that the caretaker was each of the characters. The ""deeds"" became more and more interesting and scary. I'll look forward to reading the sequel."
5,Chain Letter by Christopher Pike,"This book is about six teens who share a secret together, a secret they can't tell anyone about. Only one person knows exactly what they did and are continuiosly tortouring them one by one with a chain letter. At first it wasn't such a big deal, but later on it began to get scarier by the minute. The gang are convinced that it's either the devil or someone they know, maybe even one of them in the group. Read it! You won't regret it!"
4,Don't miss this one!!!,"Great book...Thi book is the reason I contine to read Christopher Pike...His stories are similar to R.L. Stine's in the fact that they're great for children 11+, yet more interesting and suspenseful!!"
4,Very good basic cane,Good construction for the price: Anti-rattle and safety lock. Handle is generic shape and of unknown material. I preferred contour for fingers. Black is only offered color.
5,Great!,Just the thing for use after my bypass surgery. Gave me all the secure stability that I needed to get up and out for some beautiful fall walks!
5,Excelllent and must-have,"Covers the entire Philippines, large portion where the textiles are on people!! Must have for the collector. Get the book while you still can..."
5,Really understandable book on 3 dimensional vector analysis,"Although it is out of print, this book really helped my understanding of 3 dimensional vectors and vector identities involving dot product, cross product, divergence, gradient, and curl. I could not imagine studying classical electrodynamics without first reading this book. I think it should be reprinted, and included as required reading material for every undergraduate physics major. To this day, I can still derive any of these identities by the methods used in the book, and I have not opened it in several decades. There may be other books where this material is presented as well, but I do not know of them. It has an honored place on my shelves of Physics and Mathematics books."
4,Overlooked but well sung debut,"I remember when Troop's first album had 3 hits, especially the ultra funky Mamacita, My Heart and the gorgeous, smooth ballad Still In Love. But this was the setting point for their better selling second effort. The rest of the songs are just as strong and the group has some strong vocals and harmonies. While Gerald Levert and his handlers produced this effort, Steve Russell would later produce the group's songs on later albums, giving Troop some more creativity. Troop's album came when New Edition's Heartbreak was a huge hit, but they gave NE some stiff competition musically with this effort. One of 1988's overlooked albums, but worth listening to again."
2,Why change perfection?,"The Sherman brothers (who wrote all of the songs for the film)are still alive. As a matter of fact, in the 1990's they even wrote a new musical with outstanding music (""Busker Alley"" starring Tommy Tune). Why, then, were they not asked to provide music for the show? The additional songs written by George Stiles and Anthony Drewe are jarringly different in style from what the Shermans wrote and are inferior and distracting. Actually, why add new songs at all? Why deviate from the film at all?! The movie was nearly perfect winning Julie Andrews an Oscar and Oscars for the Shermans as well. If they needed to expand the length, they could have expanded on the existing plot lines in the film... they didn't have to add the dark scenes used in the musical version.On the whole, the disc was a dissapointing listening experience."
3,"Preferred the live show, but what can you do?","I really enjoyed the play, but I wasn't nuts about the soundtrack.Laura Michelle Kelly was enchanting as Mary Poppins, but doesn't really do that much singing on the album...In hindsight, I should have purchased just the songs I liked on itunes, rather than buy the whole album.Oh well, it's still a fun, lighthearted piece, just not one I pop in and listen to all the way through."
5,"London Good, but Broadway Great","I recently saw Mary Poppins on Broadway and was blow away by the show. The songs are still in my head weeks later, which is a good thing. I bought this recording of the musical, but also have XM radio, which has access to a recording of the Broadway cast. I have to say that the Broadway cast is better. While the company is great in both, the stars shine better in the Broadway recording. Ashley Brown interpreted the songs better than her London counterpart. I can only hope that Disney will decide to release the Broadway recording."
5,The return of Mary Poppins,"Different from the movie, this version develops the characters somewhat more deeply. I especially like the depth of personality shown in Mrs. Banks."
5,Mary Poppins,"I haven't heard the soundtrack to the film for many years and it was a pleasant surprise to find a stage show had been created. The songs are essentially the same with favourites, Feed the Birds,A Spoonful of Sugar, Chim Chim Cher-ee and Step in Times sounding really good. I guess the show stopper is Supercalifragilistivexpialidocious (got it right first spelling!!!)and that sounds great too. I am now looking forward to catching the show when it opens in Australia in July."
4,"Loved it, loved it.","Like just about every other little girl who was alive in the sixties, Mary Poppins was a favorite. I had heard about the new play from a friend in New York who had just seen it and loved it, and so I got this sound track. I have it on my Ipod and listen to it all the time. My grown daughters love it also. It is a great addition to my CD collection."
2,Weird.,"Disappointing. Some of the Sherman's music is intact--with lyrics mangled and garbled. Some of the new music sounds like they're trying too hard to be ""Wicked.""I enjoyed some of the ""story adjustment."" I really missed the subplot about the bank and the song about investing ""tuppence wisely in the bank."""
1,Horrible show!,"I saw it in London, and there are literally only 2 good things about it: Burt walking upside down, and a few new (darker) additions from the original book.Nearly all the original charm and SONGS from the Walt Disney film are missing. The new additional songs are DREADFUL and were not written by the Sherman Brothers (They weren't allowed to write new songs for this due to the miserable old broad author hating the film and having on her deathbed the proviso that Shermans were not to have anything to do with a stage version)What a waste."
1,Musical Choas!,"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! It can mean excatly what you wantit too, quotes Mary Poppins. Well I want to define the theatricalproduction as Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Like a word withno meaning. No sense. That was my impression after leaving theNew Amsterdam Theatre. My advice to all is who ever feels to beentertained by this flying governess, it`s best to put on the filmversion.Ashely Brown was briliant in the title role. But co-star Englishactor Gavin Lee spoiled the Evening. His show off performance madehim over react and loosing tune in all numbers. By the time the showreached the intermision I was already sick of it and was desiring toleave half way through. I think this marks the first Disney`s theatricalas a choas. Couldn`t they have done something better such as Snow Whiteor Cinderella."
5,Mary Poppins (2005 Original London Cast),I never grow tired of hearing this music. It is always so uplifting. I find my self singing the tunes all day.
5,Excellent,Excellent reading on a variety of subjects related to the expedition of Lewis and Clark. Easy to read or to research
5,Priceless!!,Both our boys (ages 1 & 3)have loved this video. The older now narrates the video and it can sooth a grumpy infant in a heartbeat. Hightly recommend this video!
3,Younger babies hate this!,We got this when my daughter was 5 months old and she would stare at is for about 2 minutes before she would freak out. The only way I could get her to calm down would be to turn it off. They say to sit and interact with your child while they watch but most the graphics made me dizzy or were rather annoying. We havn't watched it in months but I figure we might as well give it another go now that our daughter is a bit older.
2,not what I thought....,"My 14 m/o loves the baby einstein videos so I decided to try a different brand of video. This one is more geared towards babies, even though the box says to 36 months. It is boring for the parent and older child. I bought this along with baby shakespeare and my daughter has watched it 3 times already and didnt even finish the So Smart video. This video is similar to Baby's first Video. Same black and white shapes idea. I would reccomend the baby einstein series for your toddler, and this video for infants."
2,Good but not nearly good enough,"I bought this book before I began my studies in Producing. I was looking forward to a good read that I wouldn't want to put down. I was looking for a book that would get me excited for my upcoming studies. This book did not meet my expectations. The author filled this book with a lot of information, which isn't a bad thing, but it was very monotone. I found it hard to read because I was bored easily and it felt like I was reading a 1980's text book. Very boring. I pushed myself to the end and felt relieved once I finished. He only had about 3 real life, mildly entertaining stories. I was joking to my family saying I wanted to find the author and tell him personally how boring his book was. I don't want to completely bash this book because it is filled with a lot of information and only information a working hollywood producer would know."
5,"Used by AFI, NYU, etc. - Comprehensive and Insightful","There is a reason that AFI, NYU, and other major film schools are using Schreibman's book. It lives up to its title - it really covers things from A to Z. Whether you want to understand the union rules for key grips, do's and dont's of scheduling the first day of shooting on an indie feature, tips on working with a composer, where to find the money to produce a film, how to budget, or a hundred other producing topics - this book is the place to go. If you are going to try and make an indie film - this is certainly one of the must read books."
5,Purfectttttt!,"I thought this CD was somthing that every body would want to listen to! Personally I can relate to this song ,but I would suggest every one to listen to it because it makes a good point in the song."
5,Another Quality A*Teens Song,"The A*Teens came onto the scene with there first CD, ""The Abba Generation,"" by singing old Abba classics. With their second CD, ""Teen Spirit,"" they've hit the music world again, this time with their own songs. Although they aren't classic Abba hits, the new wave of songs released by the A*Teens are an example of pop at its best. This song is worth listening to, but not at the import price of this CD. Buy ""Teen Spirit."" Although you won't find the additional remixes, you'll find this and other similar songs that will give you more for what you're paying."
2,okay......,"A*teens danceable tunes are not for me; too teeny-bopper.... their most unpleasant and boring dialoge fails to catch my interest. I will give them two stars anyway; one for them loving Britney Spears, the best woman on earth, and another for their awesome remixes! Those were not bad at all. But bore for bore, I would hardly reccomend it."
4,Move to Moev.,"It is sad that Moev's music is difficult to get ahold of these days. This album has a few songs on it that should be as classic as Ministry's Everyday is Halloween. Capital Heaven (track 8), Yeah Whatever (track 1)and Crucify Me (track 5) offer enough dark dancability to keep fans smiling and wanting more. Wanting (track 4) brings to mind Low-Life era New Order. A treasure for fans of this genre."
2,"A glamourized perspective, again","This book is intelligent, with nuances that depict elements of culture in ways that are unique and graceful. However, the author neglects to investigate the effects that having sex with multiple men for money, the many risks involved, and the need to do so to have a place of status in that society (given the child's upbringing), has on the psychological and spiritual well-being of the geishas. Health consequences are not reported.Overall, it appears that the author, although sensitive to global perceptions and multiple perspectives, has bought into cultural rules and underlying belief systems that MUST perceive geishas as gifted in order to feel ok about using them."
2,music format,"the format is not professional it is more ""home movies"" style which the narrator tells you from the beginning. It is a blessing to see the pioneers of gospel music"
3,Not the best,"This game isnt one of the better Lets Ride games. The controls are glitchy and time goes by to slow. The horse also gets hurt way to easily. It was okay for the deal that I bought it at, but its not worth full price. A younger person who doesnt know horses may like it more but its easier to brush my horse than the horse in the game"
5,A horse owner opinion,"I played this game when I was 5,6, or 7 and it has helped me a lot! I have a horse and this game is a lot like owning a real horse. Except that your a breeder, because you have a foal. Other games that are about horses are just about riding, not much care. Its like ""You can ride without taking care of your horse!"". But this game has injuries, breed shows(Im not good at showing terms, since I am usually riding just for the fun of it and I love horses), HORSE CARE. If you are a parent and you have a horse-crazy child who wants that horse or pony, get them this. It doesnt have ALL the injuries or grooming products, but it shows how much you yearn for a horse. I am giving this a big thumbs up(5 *'s)!"
2,Ehh... Not worth it,"I bought this game and raising the foal is TREACHEROUS; very, very boring. Every .10 seconds you have to groom this or groom that, and out riding, the grooming goes away in a matter of seconds. There are very few horse/color choices in this game. Overall, this game is ONLY fun when there is a show. I have Vista, and in the jumping tournaments, the game will freeze, close out, and I have to start from where I last saved it. So, I would definitely no recommend this to anyone, unless you have a dire need to buy it, it's not worth it."
2,"Okay, but how hard can a game get?","I bought this with my hard-earned money that I had earned at a garage sale while it was 100 degrees out (where I was working). I was really disappointed. It's too hard to play, but the graphics are cool and the setting is beautiful.Well, there are some really crazy glitches. For example, your horse is really starving, and you put some food in the trough. He just sits there while you worry. Then, the horse's mane is impossible to keep clean. And on top of that, he's always sick!Those two stars are for the graphics. Nothing else. Please don't waste your money; buy My Horse and Me which is a LOT better! Or get Equestrian Challenge, which is totally cool."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This game is really a waste of time. The only fun we had was laughing at how ridiculus the game is, like when you give the horse water the bucket disappears. My girls thought the horse was eating the bucket. The days are really slow. The graphics get messed up like your horse's tail sticking through a door. You can see some really great places but you can't go there. The horse can't even walk through water. And it gets thirsty on the trail which is silly since there is a creek right there it could get a drink if the game wasn't so limited. After hours and hours you can finally ride the horse except it is constantly getting a fungus and parasites. If owning a horse was this difficult no one would ever do it. Don't buy this game, we had other Let's Ride that were a lot better."
1,"Horrible,Horrible,Horrible game",This game is fun at first but then your horse starts getting sick all the time!!!!!!!!It is such a waste of money! You can't ride it at least I could not ride!I hate it! Such a waste.
1,Horrible!,"This game sucks hardcore. All you do is the stupid horse, and forget trying to keep the job at 100%, the condition of the mane and tail decay ridiculously fast. I could groom a REAL horse in less time than it spends to groom the one on the screen. The graphics are horrible,and you can't go anywhere. The show competition only counts the ribbons and bows, and there's no point or story to the game at all. Buy Equestrian Challenge or something like that with your money. This game STINKS"
1,If you have Vista forget it,"I have vista as my opperating system, and guess what... It won't run on Vista. The company the makes the game does not give any tech support if you are running the game on a new computer system. The will direct you to a site that tells you how to change to game properties, which does nothing. As you may be able to tell I am very disappointed with the game, and it was a waste of my money. Beyond that the other reviewers are correct the game is dull."
4,OK,"This was purchased as a gift and I never got any complaints, so I suppose it was OK. Delivered as promised and product appeared to be as advertised."
3,Disappointed in Quality,This was smaller than expected and the tentacles came off shortly after playing with it. There are wires holding the tentacles on and we couldn't get them back in to glue just to keep them on.
3,A remarkable series,"Andras Schiff's rendition of this whole series of 32 Sonata's is breathtaking. His skill, interpretation and dedication to these pieces is remarkable. Made so much more enjoyable by his lecture series on all the Beethoven Piano Sonatas available on the Guardian Unlimited website which makes this volume all that more accessible and enjoyable"
4,Very Practical and challenging,"If you do not want to be challanged theologically and morally please do not read this book. Perkins et al. have given very good descriptions of inner-city situations and practical steps to help restore such communitites. Don't expect simple answers that remedy themselves quickly, however.It is extremely helpful in developing good urban ministries. It was written in such a way that anyone intersted in learning to love their neighbor can benefit -- even if you have no intentions of becoming an urban minister. Also, this book would be very valuable for anyone (regardless of religious background) in the area of social services. Having said that, however, Perkins et al. certainly have Christians who wish to work in a multi-ethnic congregation in mind.The only frustration I had with the book was that it does not have an index. So be prepared to make your own as you go along so that you can find things later!"
1,"Buddhist Meditation, I don't think so","This is not music I could meditate with. I expected quiet, rhythmical, mesmerizing sound patterns. These CDs sound like Far-East elevator music. Heavily orchestrated, over-produced, with annoying vocals. It was like the ""Boston Pops does Thailand"". I am not an expert in Buddhist mediation music, but I find it hard to believe that anyone could meditate with this music. Beware!"
2,Does anyone know what this is?,"If this is the same one that Jeffery Forrester did in the 80's, I will buy it. Amazon - could you provide a little more information for us? I will be glad to give it a full review when I get it."
1,Spikes my Blood Pressure,"I can't tell you why, but Padma Basic causes my blood pressure to spike. Clearly it's not for everyone. There must be some herbs in the formula that don't agree with me."
1,Doesnt seem to work,Maybe padma 28 may work but this is reformulated in the USA to Padma Basic. The formula isnt the same. Have atherosclerosis and no way of knowing if this has improved without extensive testing. It did not reduce my cholesterol by much 251 to 249 and LDL rose from 163 to 167. Also been on a diet and lost 20 pounds. I took Padma basic for 8 months (4 a day)Although I did notice an improvement in my asthma as i havnt had to use a spray for about 6 months but didnt seem to inprove my cholesterol count and thats what I bought it for. If i re-take atherosclerosis tests I will add to this review. In my opinion I think Padma 28 from europe would be a better choice if one can find it as thats where the good tests and data comes from.
1,Padma Basic Capsules,"I just finished taking Padma Basic capsules for 4 weeks, to treat advanced osteoarthritis of hands and fingers, with Dr. approval. Took as directed; 2 capsules, 3 times per day 1/2 hour before meals. Unfortunately there was no change in swelling, stiffness or joint pain in hands, fingers or anywhere else but figured it was worth a try to avoid prescription medication and their undesirable side effects."
1,No result - Waste of Money,Tried it for 3 months. Nothing had happened. The only thing happend was just dent of my wallet. It's a waste of money!
4,a must for audtioning actors,"It's about time!!! Thank-you Mr. Hooks. Your book has been a God send, I don't have time to read every play ever written to find a great monologue. Your book did that for me, the short reviews you did were just enough to give me the flavor of the character, situation and play. Thanx for your hard work."
4,Not what I expected but might come in handy!,I thought this book actually had 1000 monologues but it does not. The book has a snippet analysis of over a 1000 monologues so if you like the analysis given then you can go find/buy the monologue. I think it will definitely come in handy when my son needs a specific monologue based on character and/or setting and this book will allow for him to narrow down his search of which monologues fit the requirements of an audition and will save him time. I would recommend the book for saving an actor time in searching for a monologue but again the book does not contain the actual monologues as I originally thought that it would.
2,2.5 out of 5,"Though it could be a useful book, it just gives you suggestions, not the actual monologues, so basically its a middle man. Doesn't help that much however if you're good at finding monologues, this is the book for yah."
5,Read it and weep,"I didn't cry reading this book. Although I nearly did. Receiving this book as a Christmas present, I thought I'm gonna have to read it. And boy did I enjoy it. It didn't take me long to read, so to say I zipped right through would be an understatement. It really was good, and I found myself identifying with a few of the characters, especially Luke. For anyone who has ever been in that kind of situation (being forced to do something, trying to fit in with a certain group), you'll be able to see yourself in the character of Luke.I would have liked this book to come with a soundtrack! I know it sounds daft, but the way the author described the music that Luke plays throughout sounds brilliant.I found the chapters sometimes slightly long - and I hate stopping in the middle of a chapter, cos I always forget where I was! That's my only complaint.The whole story is sad - so keep a box of tissues beside you."
5,Fun for All,"We bought this toy for our son when he was about 9 months old and he has gotten so much good out of it. Although he doesn't use it as much now, he still enjoys it at 18 months old. It was great for him to play with while practicing standing and has been a favorite toy when friends come to play. The train does pull off but easily snaps back on. I would recommend this activity table over all others."
3,Cute but not her favorite...,My daughter got this toy for her 1st birthday. She played with it a little but it just didn't seem to keep her busy. I think her favorite thing to do was pull the purple train off and try to put it back on. I like the toy but it wasn't a big hit with my daughter.
5,its the best activity table i've seen,"This is by far the best activity table I have seen!! I gave it to my 11 month old twins for Christmas and there are enough activities to keep them both busy at the same time. The only catch... the little train kept falling off when one of the babies would play with it. I thought that it was the toy's only shortcoming, however, I found that the train just needs to be pushed into its slot with quite a bit of force (until it snaps) and then it's good to go - no little hand can pry it loose. I wish the directions had mentioned it because for the first week I just placed the train in its slot and the babies kept taking it out. Now its the perfect toy!"
3,The newer version is not re-mastered,"For those folks who were wondering, the Sony Special Markets is a reissue but not remastered like the previous 3 studio efforts. I went ahead and bit the bullet on this one out of curiosity and then compared it to the previous Epic release. The SQ is identical, so if u already own the original release, then don't bother purchasing this one.DJ"
2,All Wango Tango after this,"I remember being excited about uncle Teds next big studio release after Cat Scratch. One of the best records ever. I think the record company was pushing the song Need You Bad. Made the radio as well as Weekend Warriors. However, neither were close to being another Cat Scratch Fever, Great White Buffalo or Free-For-All. I bought Weekend Warriors again on CD for two songs. Name Your Poison and Good Friends and a Bottle of Wine. Haven't bought anything else released after this."
4,"A Fairly Unknown, Overlooked Effort from the Nuge","20 years later, this is still my favorite Nugent album. For some reason, it's very overlooked and even Teddy-Boy doesn't do any of these tunes live, as far as I know.If I had to pick only one Nugent album to own, besides the first one, this is it."
5,Weekend Warriors is classic Nuge,All i have to say is this album is classic Nuge i really enjoyed this album as i do with pretty much everything he puts out.Great songs! Killer riffs nuff said
5,Great for everyone of all faiths,"""A smiling face is no sure sign of friendship. Friendship is found deep within a smiling heart"" Kural 786""Love, modesty, propriety, a kindly eye and truthfulness--these are the five pillars on which perfect goodness rests."" Kural 983""Eyes that remain unmoved by pity might as well be unmovable trees stumps bound in earth."" Kural 576This book is a wonderful addition to any spiritual library and is a great tool for mediation. On the cover of my book, is a sticker saying, ""India's Fortune Cookies for the Soul"" and rightly so. You apply apply most, if not all, of the 1080 Kurals (verses) from the first 2 chapters of the Tirukural to your daily life. There are Kurals from all sorts of subjects, and there are 10 Kurals per subject. Also, for each subject, there is a Kural illustrated on the left, with the Kural written in Tamil. Lastly, there is a glossary and index in the back to help you find and understand the Kurals."
5,Timeless comedy,Very funny standup special. There was a lot of comedy here that will stand the test of time. He had me laughing out loud several times.
2,Very mediocre textbook,"Two things amaze me about this book:#1 This book is in it's eigth edition#2 Prentice Hall actually published this bookWow I can't believe quality control at Prentice Hall allowed this one to slip through. It has no proof anywhere, rather it just throws equations at the reader and tries to convince the reader through examples. Several key probability and statistics concepts are no where present in this book. I was able to fill in the gaps through prior experience. I think the author must have assumed a very low mathematical capability of the reader which is strange because both business and economics get very mathematical. The data exercises are for the most part uninteresting. Also my copy has serious printing errors on several pages and the binding is weak."
1,Tons of Mistakes,"Just a quick note... This book is filled with reference mistakes and inconsistencies. Trying to study for a test, and I'm frustrated with trying to figure out what this book is saying. C'mon guys, this is the 8th edition!!"
4,Totally unnecessary,"After buying the seventh and the eighth edition of Statistics for Business and Economics. The two are pretty much the same. So, save your money, and fight back the publishing company by not purchasing this book."
5,Love it!!,This was so easy to put up and take down. My son loved it until he could figure out how to get out. Still keep it around when peple come to the house with small children.
4,Swamptreasure,The book is very helpful for gardeners in the deep South. The grids are particularly useful. I can't wait to plant my new garden at my new post-Katrina home. I have purchased other Dan Gill books in the past - always easy to understand and put into practice (too bad Katrina took them).
3,Month by Month Gardening In Louisiana,A bit of a letdown. Not many pictures and I actually really just wanted vegetable gardening information and not flower gardening.
5,Comentario en español,"Hermosa versión, musical y visual, emocionante. la recomiendo a todos los amantes de la buena música. La interpretación del coro de los escalvos es maravillosa"
5,Beautiful,"Beautifully done! Thank you Maestro Levine, Metropolitan Opera, cast, crew and the fabulous chorus. Bravo!"
5,Magnificent opera - one of Verdi's best---,"Great cast under the baton of the great James Levine. Requires a great chorus for this opera, and the Met chorus is well up to the task. Don't miss this one!"
3,not enough footage,The dvd footage is too short for my liking. They should put more into it. You will need to buy at least (3) volumes to have a good time.
4,Good old-fashioned fun for the whole family,"Watching this brought lots of childhood memories of sitting with my siblings and parents watching these shows on TV. This particular DVD includes great episodes of this old show. I was afraid our kids wouldn't comprehend this type of comedy since today's shows are quite different, but to my pleasant surprise, they've enjoyed watching them and find them quite funny! The only downside is the quality of the DVD leaves much to be desired, but I'm willing to look past that just to have these great shows around for my family now and theirs in the future."
1,No pierdan su dinero ni tiempo con estos DVD's,"Este DVD es una burla a los consumidores, son varios capitulos revueltos con un tiempo total de media hora, que horror!!!!Preferible seguir disfrutandolo en la tele hasta que televisa haga un producto del cual valga la pena comprar. Que pena........"
2,DON'T BE FOOLED!,"I saw this program on the history Channel and loved it! I even taped it so I could use it as a resource to teach my high school history students. The VCR tape was starting to get old and the quality was deteriorating. I figured I would get it on DVD to replace it - boy was I wrong! This DVD has a dry, English accent narrator which was not on the American History Channel version. His voice is matter-of-fact, and not dramatic enough to keep you interested. After a while, it became like white noise, and all I was really watching was old black and white archival footage. It's amazing how the absence of a Hollywood voice has such an effect...I'm disappointed."
4,A decent entertaining book,"Please do not read the one star reviews. They are not legitimate and appear to be from one disgruntled Beatles fan.This is a decent book for Beatles fans. Although it does not contain all of their songs, it's interesting to see how two writers list their favorites. The most entertaining parts of the book are the ""did you know"" sections and the timeline of the recording process. Maybe not as thorough and informative of a book as Revolution in the Head, however, much more user friendly."
1,incindiary,all the great songs left out is pretty unbelievable.don't waste your time or your money.lousy pictures too.
1,the worst,"This is by far the worst book on the beatles i've ever read and i've read almost all of them.All the great songs left out of this book pisses me off!These two guys are idiots, and the're book sucks!"
1,Not up to my expectations,"I purchased a quart carton of chamomile tea at a street fair about 2 years ago. I started using it a few months ago and it was excellent, in spite of its age. It had a great calming effect on me and I went to sleep about 20 minutes after drinking it. Thinking it was ""cheap"" (after all, I bought it at a street fair), I ordered Two Leaves and a Bud brand from Amazon and it was awful! I had to use 3-4 tea bags in a single cup to achieve any degree of strength or taste or desired result. In my opinion, the packaging is gorgeous; the product leaves a lot to be desired."
4,Exactly what I need it for,"I paid .69 cents for this, and its perfect for the price I paid, its sharp, rolls smoothly and is shiny. Only thing I don't like about it is I was expecting it to be a little more heavy so it feels strange to hold, but thats just a personal problem. Shipping was prompt, but the packaging was a bit off. The envelope it came in was fine but the little sleeve the item comes in was torn apart by the sharp prongs, so find an alternative way to store."
4,Real Detroit sound,"In some of the songs on this album, Detroit rapper Phat Kat laments that it took the death of legendary producer J Dilla for radio stations to actually play any of his music. As crass as that may sound, he's got a point: Hip-hop radio has completely slept on any Detroit artists that aren't Eminem or in Eminem's camp.Phat Kat, for instance, has been around for quite a while and, with this masterfully assembled album, is finally getting some due outside the 313. Basically, if you like hard-hitting beats and grimy lyrics you should like this album and you should check out other Detroit luminaries such as Black Milk and Guilty Simpson. And, of course, J Dilla."
4,Carte Blanche,"I'm so mad at myself that I only just discovered Phat Kat. Part of that whole J-Dilla movement, Phat Kat has an aggressive flow with lyrics that make you pay attention. The beats are big, I mean huge, and compliments his RZA-like flows. He even has a track dedicated to J-Dilla that is very moving. I'm glad that I finally took notice."
5,the dark world of a writer,"""In the blue horror of dawn the vines in the carpet appear likely to begin twining up his ankles."" Although I haven't attempted to publish my books, as a writer I can understand some of Mr. Earbrass's tribulations while he experiences the realm of his own novel. Although it is a humorous story, for the most part I find ""The Unstrung Harp"" moving, passionate, and honest. Earbrass is a heroic solipsist descending into his own mind to survive, at the same time offering up what he finds there for public scrutiny. I wish I could read his famous Hipdeep Trilogy. (And don't forget that Gorey's illustrations are beautiful.)"
4,A Long Headed Auther Writes A Novel,"This book has more to offer than it did in 1953, when it was first published. Most of the trouble that Mr. Earbrass goes through while he's writing a novel could be solved if he had a computer. It would be neater and easier, but, ofcourse, they didn't have that many computers in 1953, not to mention Edwardian times! This book is priceless."
3,Useful but not for the reasons the author thought.,"King's book is a very nicely written book on maximum likelihood estimation and inference in a political science context. I'm not sure it ""unifies"" political methodology (a term I feel is either overbroad or too limiting, depending on what one thinks about nonregression-like methods), though. It has a lot of nice, clearly written chapters showing examples of how to use different statistical models, all from a likelihood approach, but that doesn't answer a lot of serious questions of method at all. If it had a different title and intro chapter, that is, truth in advertising, I'd give it an 8."
3,Unsure about the strap,I really liked the watch but did not like the strap much. The strap looks rather cheap and I have feeling that it won't last.
1,Casio watch is 'cheaper looking' than it appears onlin.,"From the web site photos and specs, I thought this watch was a decent watch. Upon arrival, it's clearly a discount looking material and design. Online, the gray parts look metal, but in reality the watch is all plastic and the gray dial is a ""painted coating."" Entering data is tedious and time consuming, and display of that info is very poor. I use it for timing my swimming/running since it is light weight and has Indiglo. However, I don't wear it to work or formal as it's too cheap and plastic looking. Casio has much better looking watches than this one. For a few dollars more, I could have bought a much nicer watch with timer and backlighting, and a ""REAL"" METAL FACEPLATE/DIAL!"
1,Boring- My daughter will not watch it,"I was surprised that my very attentive 1 year old who loves to watch all sorts of videos (e.g Baby einstein series, Bear in the big blue house, elmo) will not watch even a minute of this video. I tried appropriate parental participation, showing it to her at different times of the day, etc. She does not give it a second glance while she walks away from the television."
4,Not just for folks who have lived there,"I have never lived in Japan, but have visited, and found a certain ""something"" wonderful about that country and its people that I could never find adequate words to describe. Alan Booth communicates both the mystique and the down-to-earth attitude Westerner finds in Japan--I think it's that ""something"" that I've searched my own intellect, but failed, to describe. Reading Alan Booth's ""Looking for the Lost"" has helped me to connect with those subtle attractions that I found in Japan, and that kept me returning.Since most reader-reviewers recommend this book to those who have lived in Japan, I'll add my voice and recommend it to those who have spent limited time there, or who are planning to travel in the outer-reaches of this gorgeous country."
3,Falls short,"If you have a Honda,and you know what is wrong,then this is the book for you.This manual gives you a step-by-step breakdown and rebuild of your car.But alas!there are no trouble-shooting sections anywhere in the book.There are no,""If it does that,then these may be the causes sections."" This manual is definitely for the advanced mechanic with access to a machine shop.If you are a week-end mechanic who wants to diagnose and repair minor problems,then this is not the manual for you.I was disappointed."
3,"Good help for Civics in general, but not for 92-95 ones.","I was looking for help for my 94 Civic.Good:- Clear diagrams/illustrations.- Clear index.Bad:Compared with the diagrams shown for other years of Civic, I'd say there are fewer diagrams and illustrations for the 92-95 one. For example, the book shows a diagram on removing the fan/heating switch from the front panel of a model before 92, but no diagram for the 92-95 one. Also some terms used in the illustrations are not explained clearly, so I was not sure which part(s) they're referring to.I'd rate this book better if it included a better help for the 92-95 model."
2,"Poor graphics, lack of detail, poor coverage of all models.","This was disappointing. The ""Total Car Care"" repair manual had non-detailed drawings instead of photos leaving you with only a vague idea of where the part that you are looking for is in relation to the rest of your car. The text was about as good as the graphics... it could have been more detailed and/or descriptive. Another probelm was that the graphics gave only a single example of the procedure being described (as shown for the '84-'87 CRX... not very helpful to orient you to a 95 Civic). Compared to the other manuals that I have seen (Haynes and Clymer mostly) this one left alot to be desired at about twice the price. This one will give you a ballpark idea of what you will need to do to fix your Honda, but I would consider purchasing a single-model specific repair manual at a cheaper price."
1,Bad Reference!!,"This book is chock full of errors. I don't have any faith in the contents of this book. Color codes of wires are incorrect in troubleshooting areas, and there is poor coverage of all model years, especially newer ones. The book tells you what fault codes are but it does not tell you how to access them. I own two Hondas and I end up using the internet to get the information this book, more often than not, neglects to include. Purchase at your own risk -- it's too bad that it is the only book on the market for many Honda models."
3,has good spec info,"Describes in detail,list all info you would need to know as in bolt torque,chassis electrical wiring diagram and vacuum hose diagrams.valve,camshaft, connecting rod, crankshaft, piston and ring specs."
2,It's a chilton manual....,"It sucks, but it's a necessary tool every once in a blue moon. They have little in the way of pictures that you can see what there showing, but it's better than nothing I guess."
4,satirical answer to why they do that in congress,"pbs newsman jim lehrer has a new novel ""Purple Dots"" that is fun to read because it anwers the question i've often asked myself, ""why does Congress do the things it does"" in an amusingly satirical way. the book tells the story of a presidential appointment for director of the CIA and how his congressional confirmation becomes the struggle between his friends and a senator and his staff over the nomination. there are many games to be played out before the issue is resolved. Many of these have the ring of authenticity as well as being funny. The actions of the appointee's friends captures the fellowship and spirit of those who have worked together in prior relationships in an intense way. the friends who are all retired live on a charming area of the w. va. panhandle that gets some vivid description of the good life after retirement. all in all this is a good read ...but don't take it seriously."
1,"Clancy, It's not",This COULD have been a good read. It is probably the most unsatisfying book I have read in a long time. The only reason I bought it was I have great respect for the Author as a journalist and Don Imus hawking it on his show. Mr. Lehrer could have served the reader by including the menu's from all the restaurants instead the wasted page after page of what they ate. I am not aware of fresh water fish having sex- I thought females spewed eggs on a bed and the males did their things to the eggs. I suggest that Mr. Lehrer read Stein on Writing and Zuckerman Writing the blockbuster novel. The characters in this book are flat and the only one I liked was the fat lawyer.Mr. Lehrer should keep his day - night job.Steve Roberts
3,"Interesting, good tension points, but too objective!","As Publishers Weekly review says: ""Lehrer maintains admirable objectivity: no character is ultimately sympathetic . . . "" But admirable or not, Lehrer's objectivity is a bit too much for an inveterate fiction reader like me. In contrast perhaps to many readers, I enter the world of fiction already believing, in fact, that the vast majority of people, specifically including those in government and big corporations, are generally honest and otherwise moral. But when I read mystery fiction, I want to be transported into a world of smart-good-people overcoming smart-bad-people. I can achieve that in PURPLE DOTS only by switching viewpoints between Henderson and Madigan. But that's akin to playing chess with oneself: it can be OK, but it's not totally satisfying to do it. But Lehrer's writing was good enough that I would generally recommend this book to others and definitely give another of his fiction books a trial."
4,"Worth Reading, did not like the ending.","This book give a great window into the workings of Washington's political world (very realistic). It also does a fabulous job at giving a taste of non-political life outside the beltway and can almost be used as a tour book of VA, WV, MD. It's a short book, great to read on a long flight! It kept me in suspence almost to the end. Worth reading, although I did not like the ending!"
1,Too big and belt hook closure not reliable,"This pouch is too big for a single pair of glasses but made of the right material to protect them. I liked the idea of the carabiner_type hook attachment but the piece of metal (metal spring) that closes the mouth of the hook comes off when you try and detach the pouch from the loop of your pants. You also need to reinstall it a certain way or it doesn't work as a spring. Something needs to be done to keep that piece of metal in place, without that this case is pretty worthless as far as I'm concerned."
1,"Big, bulky,","This case is a lot bigger than an average pair of sunglasses; too big and bulky. the metal piece on the clip is constantly coming off and breaking loose under normal pressure to release clasp. Don't like this, I would return it if I had the original packaging."
3,Poor description...Decent case,"The case is really nice, cool looking & well built. The big issue for me is that the description is 'Hard Case' but its has basically a nice cardboard lining. So it not suitable for storing in your luggage when traveling."
5,Tough nice case,Large tough case with lots of options to carry! I can't believe how sturdy this case is. Well worth it If you have an expensive pair of glasses to protect or even your iPhone!
2,Civilian Lab POD Sunglasses Case,The case is too big for carrying around attached to a belt.Best for storing items in a luggage.It is big enough for 2 glasses or other items.
3,"Nice Design, Some Execution Flaws","The case is nice, probably one of the nicer strap on glasses cases I've found. The case itself seems durable, and able to sustain light abuse from travel or backpacking.The hardware on the case however leaves much to be desired. both the clip lock and snap locks don't seem to hold very well. the clip lock has broken a couple of times, requiring on the spot repairs. I no longer trust the case's fasteners, and have instead fixed it to my pack using parachute cord.Lastly, the zipper is made of poor quality metal, after 6 months, it the zipper pull broke off, and now I have to use my fingernail to open or shut the case."
4,Great case for a year,I'm very hard on things and after about 1 year the zipper disconnected. But its still the best thing I can find for 2 glasses (but wrap them with a cleaning cloth as others have said. I'm buying another one now.
1,The Cat Who Said Cheese was disappointing compared to others,"Every book Ms. Braun has published has been incredible and very consistent until her latest book. I was very disappointed. The cats were barely mentioned, the wonderful descriptions of Quill's current residence were lacking, and the humor seemed to disappear compared to all of her other wonderful books.I have recommended these books to everyone and will continue to do so, but I feel this last book must have been written in a hurry, or perhaps her private life had problems greater that other years and it couldn't be helped.I do hope she returns to her previous way of storytelling in the next book. I am one of her greatest fans, and have read every book three times now. I live in fear that someday the newest book I am reading might be her last, since all things must come to an end eventually."
4,Happy,I loved this book along with others in the series. I'm a sucker for mysteries. It is a little bit on the childish side but i found it to be cute while still focusing on the mystery at hand. Its a good read when you don't want something too serious but still want that bite of mystery.
5,"Another winner for the ""smart cat.""","I think I have read every one of the adventures of Mr. Q, Koko and Yum Yum and this tale rates right up there with all the rest---wonderful reading."
5,"Entertaining, and the cats don't talk!","I had seen this cat series around, but never read it, because I (wrongly) assumed that cats talked in the books, and that just wasn't my cup of tea. I was extrememly pleasantly surprised when I read this newest entry and found myself enjoying a very entertaining murder mystery. The cats are pets, and their owner talks to them, but the cats DEFINITELY don't carry on a conversation. it's kind of what you think your own pets might be thinking--he ascribes them with the insight of dropping clues to the mystery. I found myself trying to figure out what town in Michigan this series takes place, and that is another entertaining part of the book. All in all a fun, entertaining read--I've since read three more books in the series. They are somewhat addictive"
3,Easy-to-follow storyline and characters.,"Although I own eight of the books in this series, this is the first one I have gotten around to reading. I thought the storyline flowed very easily (without all the ups and downs of the mystery books I usually read) and was easy to follow. The characters were real and believable, and there weren't so many of them that you lost track of who was who. Although I have cats, and believe that they can have mysterious qualities all their own, I don't necessarily care for the connotation that the Siamses cats have some level of 'psychic' ability--I think this part is majorly overplayed. All in all, though, I thought it was a good read, and I'm sure I'll be reading more of her books in the future."
2,"Buyer Beware... Good Quality, but Wrong Size","I ordered this product for my 2006 Honda Accord. The Amazon.com search bar auto tool said that it was the appropriate break rotor for my car. Knowing that Bendix makes quality auto parts, I went ahead and ordered it.Unfortunately, I found out much too late that its size was too big for my car. Is that Bendix' fault? Not really, but without writing this review about it, you may make the same mistake that I did. It's too bad Amazon didn't bother to simply write in the actual length of the break rotor, because it would have saved us both a lot of time and effort.So, before buying this break rotor (it's 11.6 inches, by the way- I found this out the hard way) be sure you know what size you need for your vehicle. Don't always trust the Amazon auto tool.Hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions."
2,Not so great.....,"The watch itself, is a nice watch. However, I bought it because it was advertised as water resistant. When I received it, I noticed that the stem did not screw down. All my past water resistant watches had screw down stems...which I can only assume....make them ""water resistant"". When I contacted the company to question this, their answer was to take it off before going swimming (what???). The reason I buy water resistant watches for my husband is because, sometimes, he forgets. No big deal with his past watches, so I purchased this one so he had a couple (I still like the look of it, though).Had I not thrown all the packaging away...I would have sent this back immediately after receiving that answer."
5,Very Happy With This Purchase,"Great value, plenty of features. Nice looking watch, I receive lots of compliments on it."
4,Perfect everyday watch,"I think this is the third of this model I've owned.. The watch is so reasonable, between a band a battery, might as well just replace them. It's a great looking and reliable watch. Looks much more expensive than it is. I laugh at my friends that have Rolex Sub-mariners, as these look similar at half the price of their annual service...AND keep better time. Current watch has the black face, but the Gold is really sharp too! I only gave it 4 stars, as there is no night light, and the hands really are impossible to see at night. (that's why I'm still cruising the Casio's on Amazon @4am!!!)"
4,Casio good but lacks useful features.,"This is an old style Casio with limited functionality, but it does everything it's supposed to do. I chose this from among the throngs of analog/digital stopwatch water resistant watches because it has a rotating bezel, the hands don't obscure the digital screen, and it has a non-metal band and is suitable for exercise. It doesn't have a light or a countdown timer. Timex makes a watch with the features of this Casio and the features that it lacks, but I prefer Casio's logic. Hopefully Casio will get a clue and provide a watch with all of the features described in this review."
5,"Perfect but,",This watch is almost perfect. All Casio needs to do is add a light. The dial does glow for a few minutes after exposure to light but not well enough to rely on it when you are really in the dark. Great style though. All other features are wonderful.
1,Doesnt keep time,Stopped working after 2.5 months. you would a watch to keep time but it does not. dont buy this watch
4,watch it,i truly enjoy my casio amw320r-1ev divers watch. for the money it's perfect for my every day use. it has the functions i need while being stylish AND affordable. a great buy. thanks amazon. once again you have a very satisfied customer and i will continue to patronize your service. ron
4,Very good watch,"This has been a very good watch so far. I've only had it for two months. I like the style and at least appearance of ruggedness. I'm usually pretty hard on watches and don't like to spend a lot of money on a watch that I'll break. The price was very good too on Amazon, about $15 less than WalMart. My only complaint (and I knew it before I purchased it) was that the watch is fairly large and thick. I wish it was a little smaller for someone like myself who doesn't have a large wrist...but that's not the watches fault!!"
2,Great until the band comes off or it's dark,"I have had 3 of these watches over the years, but I finaly gave up on them. I LOVE the look, but they have 3 big drawbacks, First off, no light. The glow paint on the watch is pretty dim. Second, it goes through batteries pretty quick. When the battery gets low the hands stop moving but the digital part still works. First time that happened I thought the watch had malfunctioned. Third, the band comes off the watch! The pin that holds it on isn't robust enough. That is why my last one is on the bottom of the river right now."
2,"Beautiful by day, invisible by night","In daylight, this watch is HOT. Looks perfect.At night, forget it. I mean it. When you wake up or go to bed, if it's your habit to look at your watch, you won't see it. Like, not even a glimmer of light off a hint of steel. NOTHING. Nada. Zippo.The reviews are true. The dayglow sometimes glows during the day and you wish it would glow at night. If you shine a light on the glow paint it will glow for about 20 mins, and then zippo, nada. Nothing. And this is NEW, out of the box. And I've heard flies louder than this alarm. The alarm is way weaker than the watch looks.Too bad. It could be a perfect watch with actual luminesence and a shockingly loud alarm."
4,Great Watch,"I have been wearing the same watch since 1994, and only recently had to replace it due to cosmetic reasons. The watch has had the batteries replaced, new bands, etc But the functions have never failed. I own two of these watches now, and have just recently ordered a G Shock. Casio has a life long customer with me. The watch itself is large, and looks good if you have the build for it. I'm 6'2 220, and it still stands out on my wrist."
2,Returned for a new one,"This is a great looking watch and I like the dual analog digital functions. But the analog portion of this watch does not keep time, the minute hands locks up sometimes and you look at the watch and it is 20 miutes behind and then you reset it and a couple days later it does the same thing. The digital keeps time but I would like the analog portion to keep time so I am trying to contact Casio to get it repaired as I let the return period lapse.Update: I changed the battery and all seems well. You do need special tool to get back off of watch. I will update if it quits working again.Update #2: It quit working again and I sent it back to Casio, in about a month they just sent me a new watch that so far works fine. I had to pay to ship it to Casio and have replaced a battery in the first watch."
3,Like others...Cool looking but issues with analog time,I wish this watch worked. It looks cool and works as a dive watch except the analog time seems to stop at times. I am not sure it is a battery issue because it will run fine for days keeping time well and then I will look at it a day later and then it will be 15 minutes or more off...then it does well for several more days. Seems very random. (the digital is always fine)
1,Analog time has lost time even after warranty repair,"Bought watch October 16th, 2011. Noticed it was losing time on the analog portion, but digital time remained correct. Finally sent it in for warranty - whicch I paid shipping to send it, plus had to pay $9.95 for shipping and handling to get it back. Now 3 months after getting it back it is doing the same thing again! I have had great success with Casio digital watches, but this analog/digital watch has been frustrating."
5,My 3rd one,I really like these Casio dive watches. This is my 3rd one. I like that the analog dial is easy to read and the digital stopwatch-calendar-alarm comes in very handy. It's rugged and looks great. The lack of lighting and the need to replace the band and battery every few years are minor issues.
1,Nice looking watch...when it works,"This watch was exactly what I was looking for: a waterproof casual weekend watch that wouldn't break the bank. I've been wearing it on and off for three months and find it comfortable and easily readable....however it doesn't work.Quite frequently the analog portion seems to stop...just stop. I reset it to current time and it will work for a while, but then it will simply stop again.The digital clock in the center of the dial keeps great time, but not as visible. I'm pretty disappointed as I've bought junky sports watches on eBay that have worked for years and kept great time."
5,bought in store,bought this watch at waalmart for 89$ and saw it here for half the price. I am telling anyone this is one fo the best watches i have had in a long time. I have a rolex and invicta and also movado but love th elook and also the feel of this one especially for all my sport needs.
4,Casio Men's Marine Ana-Digi Dive Watch AMW320R,"I just got this watch and as others have stated it would be nearly perfect if it had an indiglo, but for my needs the hands glow well enough to get by in the dark. One note...I actually bought mine at [...]. They started selling them just a few days ago. Mine actually has the dark blue face which I've not found anywhere else."
2,Good watch until it stopped working,It started off as a good watch and I only had it for about a month when I woke up and it had just stopped working. Its possibly that it might have been the only defective watch in the batch but who knows....
1,Malfunction,"The 'B' button quit working, now the digital display is useless, and worse, the watch is stuck in alarm mode. Don't waste your money."
1,Does not keep time,"And no, its not the battery. The analog portion does not keep time. I replaced the battery and this did not fix the problem, so I returned the watch to the store and exchanged it for an identical one. Same problem with the analog portion losing time, and replacing the battery did not work. The watch is still under warranty, but I'm just going to return it and get my money back from the store. Why should I pay money to mail it to Casio and wait who knows how long to get another one? If I had the same problem with 2 watches, that tells me that Casio is making a piece of junk. Its a shame because I really like the design of the watch."
2,Time bomb!,"Other than the fact that the analog clock doesn't keep accurate time (loses an hour or so every 24 hrs.) I really like the watch. I will get another one, but am frustrated by the inconvenience. Digital time works and I like the look and feel of the watch. Nice size for a guy. Being a big guy I like a substantial time piece. Many watches don't fit the bill due to the watch face being too small. If it works a great value."
3,Needed new battery in 3 months,The watch works great. My son is an EMT and uses it for work but he had to spend $20.00 for a new battery after owning it for just 3 months.
5,great watch,i had one of these watches before and went thru three bands as normal and then lost it and was happy to find it online at amazon.com so i bought it. works great for me.
4,Excellent Watch,"This is a very nice watch for the money.ProsThe high contrast face is easy to read at a glance.The watch has a nice solid feel.Rotating bezel.Alarm, date, stopwatch.Simple, classic look with modern features.Cons:No light.The bezel moves a little too easily, it should be a little stiffer.I was looking at moderately priced dive watches from Invicta, Citizen and Seiko. The problem with these sort of watches, which really irritates me, is the lack of a real date function. I don't consider a counter which goes to 31 acceptable. Paying more than a hundred dollars for a watch that needs resetting every month or so is ridiculous. Many watch manufacturers have been lazy for decades, putting out the same ancient design with some cosmetic changes. This Casio is a great mixture of the classic with the modern. To get a watch from the ""better"" companies with these features costs at least four times as much. And will they last four times as long? Unlikely."
4,Casio Watch,"Great value, rugged and stylish. Have owned the gold face equivalent for 10 years. Beat it to death scuba diving, working on my cars and around the house - never a problem. Only complaint is the band - can't seem to find a replacement of the same quality as the original at most common retailers, so order an extra or two w/the watch."
5,My Second Dive Watch,"When these first came out, I bought one at Costco because they were so reasonably priced. I've worn it exclusively for years and wished I had purchased another while Costco had them. While shopping Amazon, I was pleased to find then NEW and available for even less then my previous purchase. I forgot how nice these are right out of the box! They are sporty yet stylish enough to wear with a coat and tie. Durable as can be and the silver brushed casing contrasts nicely with the black face. This is a great watch and one you will be very happy with."
4,Nice Watch,"Nice watch but I hope it will work to dive with. Here's a Marine Dive Watch that says in the paperwork that it is not rated for Scuba Diving. I'm real tough on watches so at the price, I'll scuba with it and see how long it takes to break."
4,great,"this is a great quality watch, and look very similar to expensive ones like seiko or citizen. i decided to order it and got to me very fast and no problems at all, only bad thing is that it does not have a light to check it in the dark."
4,Great watch - great value,I really am glad I bought this watch. I like the functions on it. It is very durable and I love the watch band (I just wish it was a little longer). Besides the watchband (which I can replace) the only down-side to it is the illuminating material on the numbers isn't very bright. But I would still purchase this watch again if I had the choice.
1,"Looks good, works bad","This is the second time I have owned this model watch. The first was purchased from Costco. The second from Amazon. Both times, the watch movement stopped working correctly after less than a year.The watch style and intended functionality would be great... If the watched worked for more than 6 months...I would give it 4-5 stars on looks and exterior quality for the price, but I have to give it 1 star based on the inferior quality of the inner mechanism."
3,casio watch,"I have had three or four of these watches over the years. This one works most of the time. However, the analog hands sometimes lag behind, they either stop or show the wrong time. The second hand moves okay but the hour hands get behind. This has happened three or four times since the watch was delivered about a month ago. This never happened with my previous watches of this type. The price was right and the service was acceptable. I will keep this watch but I can't trust it. I am disappointed in its performance. It is too much trouble to return it!"
