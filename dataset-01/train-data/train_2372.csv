5,Good collection of workouts,Both of these workouts are good - The Abs are so hard to get through at first and the Arm workout you will probably want to have some small weights to use along with the video.
3,Is it bad to expect more for 8 minutes,"I feel like I am watching a late 80's/early 90's infomercial. The quality of the video is pretty bad. Perhaps I have been spoiled by other DVD's like Tamilee Web's ""I Want That Body"" that had me more pumped and motivated than this one. I came away from the 8 minute workouts somewhat disappointed, and definitely not as motivated to keep trying it. But that's the point isn't it? These videos should kick our butts and make us want to come back for more.I'd recommend the Tamilee Web and Quick Fix programs over this one any day... but maybe I am expecting too much for 8 minutes."
4,"Great for breaking those ""no-time"" excuses","I've used this + the 8 Minute Buns & Legs workout tapes and am quite satisfied with both. The instructor has a slightly-annoying way of saying ""ok GANG"" but all-in all, you get what you pay for and it's easy to increase the difficulty by increasing the handweights. Abs section could be improved by replacing some of the standard crunches with lower-body exercises such as taught in Pilates/Yoga tapes."
2,it's for ladies..,"I think it's ok as an overall workout..but about the ABS workout it developed my lower ABS more than the Upper part..I think this workout is designed for ladies since thay have a problem most of the time with the lower ABS ,but I don't advise men to do this workout."
4,not waterproof,"looks great. beautiful color. we put a small waterproof pad over it to prevent accidents, otherwise it would constantly be in the wash."
3,"ok, but not great . . .","I thought the stuff about the application process was really helpful, but the info on the schools was a little vague and confusing. It was hard to tell what he thought sometimes and a lot of it was just his opinion, not fact. My poetry prof who was helping me out said that some of the info was just plain wrong, or subjective, and she has two creative writing degrees and knows a ton of people who teach in these programs. But I thought some of the little details were interesting; there just weren't enough of them, I guess. I still had to go to all the websites and talk to people anyway. i also bought Amy Holman's An Insider's Guide to Creative Writing Programs at the same time and found that guide to be A LOT more helpful. It doesn't give you that much more info, but it's more straightforward and unbiased.But hey, the good news is that I ended up getting into two pretty good programs, so some of it must have worked!"
5,(Totally) Required Reading,"This book is essential for anyone applying to MFA programs. I applied to a small number last year without the book, as I was ill-informed about lots of the nuances of the process. Now I'm applying to ten programs, all with good funding, all programs I found and read about in this book. The writing is funny, easy to love, and completely necessary during the crazy time of applications. If you're paying all the money to apply to programs and get transcripts, the fifteen bucks you spend on this book will be the best money you spend. That is, until you get into a program!"
4,Wish I'd had this years ago,"I wish this guide had existed earlier, but I had a good experience in my MFA program anyway, and that's important to note since they're getting widely trashed. Here's my Huffington Post blog ""Are MFA Programs a Waste of Time? Mine Wasn't"":[...].It's written from the perspective of an author of 19 books, 100s of anthology stories, essays, columns and reviews. You can check me out at [...]."
1,THIS CD GIVES ME A HEADACHE,"I usually don't like to write negative reviews, and I'm sure that for many people this cd is wonderful. If you enjoy it I think you should get it. But as for myself, I find it very unpleasant. The crystal bowls produce a kind of low pitched hum that gives me a headache every time. There are pleasant sounds too, some higher pitched tinkling sounds but the hum is almost continuous and really ruins it for me. I bought this one with Seven Metals, Singing Bowls of Tibet about two years ago. Seven Metals I love, I listen to it almost every day. I practice meditation and love good meditation music, especially Tibetan bells.But Crystal Singing Bowls I really can't take. So before you order do listen first if you can."
3,"Hmmm, interesting...","Some of the tracks make for quite transcendental experiences, although turn down the volume if you're listening on headphones - the tones won't suit everyone. The sound quality is true to life, I was doubting if the 'goosebumps' quality of real crystal bowls would be evident in a recording, but they seem to be."
5,I love the sound,Every time I listen this CD I feel so good and relaxed. I love the sound of quartz bowls. Thanks
1,very poorly made toy,"We bought this toy for my son who LOVES spiderman. He was so excited. We picked out one and the arm was broken in the package. Luckily, we found another. We bought it and took it out of the package, and his arm fell off w/o even touching it! We popped it back in and it has constantly fell out. We will have to return this toy, even though my son is greatly disappointed. Hopefully, Marvel will come up w/ a better product."
4,No plastic flowers,"I don't like flowers or butterflies or cute pictures of puppies... I mean, I do, but I don't need them on my fridge.These are cool, remind me of something I don't get to do often enough, and hold stuff.My kid's flyer for the pumpkin festival looked all that much better with these sweet magnets holding it up.They work great"
4,Jessica Fletcher meets her match,"I really enjoyed this book. It is the predecessor to a lot of the women detective books. Its about a woman who finds out her new husband was once accused of murder. She decides, against a great deal of advice including her husband's, to find evidence of his innocence. On the way, she meets a number of interesting and superbly drawn characters. The book does contain a good deal of Victorian romance and prejudice, however. I found the portrayal of a smart young woman as constantly overcome by her emotions a bit bothersome. Plus, I've never liked love stories and, basically, this is one."
5,consistently entertaining!,If you are a fan of Collins like I am you will enjoy this book! It has the same flavor as The Woman in White and Moonstone. A great read!
1,Good idea but poor execution,"The idea behind this product makes perfect sense. There's no reason we should be wasting our time picking through the litter box to remove the cat's leavings. Sifting the entire contents through some kind of screen like device to remove it all in one shot is obviously the way to go.Unfortunately this product was designed to be produced at the absolute minimum cost, and it shows. I'd be surprised if the 2 pieces of moulded plastic cost the manufacturer more than 30 to 40 cents when purchased in quantity. If it had been made with better materials than the thin plastic molded material it's made of, it could easily work a lot better.It's also far too small. I have three cats & use 2 of these units side by side, & they still aren't big enough to keep the litter from getting all over the floor where they're located.What a shame."
3,"Low sided litter pan with full area scoop. Good idea, suboptimal execution","Good: InexpensiveBad: Sides too low (litter is scattered, urine gets outside); Scooping tray is too flexible to work well"
1,Not useful for clumping litter,"Well, it was a good idea, poorly executed.Why is it that building a better litter box is as futile as trying to build a better mousetrap?The inner ""scoop"" is not really fitted to the bottom of the pan, so there's a gap between the mesh and the bottom of the main pan.This gap means that when your cats pee and the litter clumps, it clumps AROUND the mesh, and you end up having to scrape both sides of it to get them off, breaking up the clumps and making an incredible mess.We ended up using the litter box part as a litter box, and the liner ""scoop"" went in the trash."
5,Excellent tea,I drink this tea nearly every day. St. Dalfour teas are excellent. This is a standard black tea and the cherry is very subtle and not sweet at all. I drink tea straight and really like this one in the afternoon and evening. I usually go with the breakfast and Ceylon St. Dalfours in the morning.
5,what a great read!,"i never, never do these review kind of things, but i just had to write and say how much i loved this book. if you're like me, you are always looking for the next great read...something that holds you as much as say... white oleander.. well, this is the book. it's a wonderful beach book, plane book, bedside table book... or the book you keep in your car( as i did) to read when someone is late... and you're sitting there... when i was reading this book- i loved it when my friends were late! it should be on the oprah best book list ... read it and see you don't thnk so too!"
4,Awakening to the Quan Yin energy,A compelling story of two women whose lives intertwine through the years at crucial points. One has hidden her fears and shame so well she achieves an outwardly successful life. The other is very public in her descent into hell. There is a point that both women find the peace and salvation they longed for their whole lives. It is the Quan Yin energy force that releases them both. The journey to their goal is what it is all about. Well worth the read. Carol Simone keeps you turning the page longing for their release through spiritual awakening.If you like this book you may enjoy:The Dove A Gift Archangel Micha/el
3,Too much statistical details,"I got defocused with all the statistics and accrediting details. Of course this probably should be wholly contributed to the instructor's purpose for this assigned reading. However, there were parts of this book that were quite informative and spiritually stimulating."
2,Never Got it,"Never got book, but not fault of the dealer, due to the post office. however they never credited back my card."
5,Great,Came on time and in great condition. Needed this book for school and love the price because the school wanted wayyy to much for it
4,Christian is the main subject,This book is all about being a Christian Counselor. It was a purchase for the Liberty Masters of Counseling curriculum. The book focuses mostly on Biblical Counseling.
5,Competent Christian Counseling,"This book is very informative and inspiring. It will be helpful in the field and within church community. Also, it will help with all interpersonal relationships now and in the future.Thank you."
4,Helpful,"While I wouldn't call this a weight-loss bible, it is really helpful in laying out nutritional requirements while breastfeeding. A great resource for breatfeeding moms who want to make sure they're eating healthy."
4,It points you in the right direction,"This book sure helped me learn the things I could do not only to lose weight successfully, but to eat right in general. Being pregnant, I was always hungry and had no problem getting enough nutrition. But now with the baby and two older kids, I was forgetting to eat and forgetting the importance of it."
2,OK Just Because No One Else Has a Book,"I was a little disapppointed with the book, but it did give some good nutritional information. There just isn't any other information out there. La Leche has some information in their ""Breastfeeding Answer Book"" about weight loss. I found some contradictions in the book like the author says doctors tell everyone to eat about 800 extra calories without regard to individual body types and needs and then she does exactly the same in her plan! Not the information I had hoped for..."
3,Useful guide with some practical tips.,"This book provides helpful information for understanding nutritional needs of the breastfeeding mom. While it has some useful nuggets of information, it is not as comprehensive as I would have liked. This is a good reference but I think I'll need to do additional reading or consult a nutritionist before starting a healthful diet that will not affect my milk supply or quality."
2,Not helpful!,"I bought this book before I gave birth to my daughter last October. I read it while I was on maternity leave, and immediately had doubts about the content. There are pages and pages of sample menus, which are basically the same meals and snacks repeated over and over in different order, and they're not that imaginative at that! There is nothing in this book that any woman does'nt already know about moderation and eating healthily. It's an account of one woman's opinions on her experience of losing weight after giving birth, give this one a miss!"
2,NO MAGIC BULLET,"I bought this book looking for pointers on how to take advantage of my increased metabolism while breastfeeding to drop some baby pounds, but there are no magic bullets here. There is some interesting stuff about special nutritional needs while breastfeeding and lots of discussion about certain nutrients. But if I followed the diet advice in this book, I'd gain weight for sure! Just way too much food. It's just an outline of a sensible balance diet not unlike what is recommended during pregnancy. I'd have to say the book's title promises enlightenment but really doesn't deliver."
1,Are you kidding me...???,"This book was such a disappointment to me! The majority of her information is completely inaccurate. I would have expected a little more coming from a dietician. The only thing I can say about this book on a positive note, is a few of the recipes are okay and she supports breastfeeding. I felt like this book was/is right with our culture...focused on how mom looks after having a baby. New mom's have enough on their plate worrying about how to adjust to this little person who's taken over their life. They don't need another book emphasizing how their body should look or perform. Every mom is different, I know. I just think mothers should be focused on breastfeeding successfully and loving their sweet baby, not trying to fit into prepregnancy pants 2 weeks postpartum. A lot has changed in 14 years and new mom's need to realize that as well...this book is 14 years old. Good luck."
5,Spy B-Movies Make for Some Decent MST3Ks,I personally enjoy Spy B-Movies on MST3K - they always make me shake my head and wonder if the movie ever wanted to be taken seriously in the first place. One of the first MST3Ks I saw that made me a MSTie.
5,Great price for a replacement!,My daughter lost her earphones and I was so suprised to see that Amazon had the original ones for such a wonderful price! They work perfectly.
1,lousy headset,"I don't advice any one to buy this headset cuz it's missy and my friends complain when i speak to them cuz it is very sensitive , it catches all the voices surrounding me and my voice is too loud nomatter what i do , and i could hear from 1 earpeice the second is not working , when i put the earpeiece in my ears the mic is all the way to my navel , i advice the seller to stop selling this lousy and missy headset ."
5,It's the greatest!,"This is da perfect history, I said it 'cause I can't live witthout it! I love Pikachu, Ash, Misty, Brook, Charmander, uff, they are cute little monsters... I'd like to say I love them... you should see it... With this I cry (specially in the first chapter), I laugh, I can do anything... I love it!"
2,more like pokemonstrosity,"digimon is a better anime, pokemon has a dull plot. Pokemon can also only say their name which makes small charecter development while digimon have personalitys(! ). Pokemon is waaaaaayyyyyy to strict on sensoring, they sensored a slap! . Ash is a poor leader and master, The charecters never change at all practicly, avoid this like sepiroth on a bad day."
5,Poke'friennds,The squirtle squad one it so cool i love that one anfd that Charmander one scared me so much that he was going to die and that bulbasaur one was hulris
2,not my fave,"altho i usually like pokemon, this video was never my favorite. it does introduce 3 important pokemon, squirtle, charmander, and bulbasaur, but the cartoons are fairly boring, esp. the 1 about bulbasaur. the srtay charmander is kinda cute, and the squirtle squad aint so bad, but cuda been better."
5,This was good. Ash got all of the starter pokemon.,"Ash got all of the beggining Pokemon. He even got a Squirtle, the one he origanlly wanted."
5,Great,Stepson is autistic. He's 30 years old. Temple Grandin appears in this movie and she is one of my heros. Read her books. Now have a better understanding of what my wife was up against.
5,a totally critical impressive film,"This film depicts a therapy that allows autistic children to communicate. Nothing could me more important than that.The one critic on this site wants to believe that these kids are mentally retarded and would discourage families from investigating the therapy under the guise of worrying that the therapy might be expensive. In fact, this therapy costs less than most other therapies offered to autistic individuals. Unfortunately, some people out there who ""have worked with autistic individuals"" believe that the therapy they practice is the only one that works or are skeptical about new/different therapies. They'd rather believe that this is all in parents' minds than believe that they were unsuccessful with students and that something else worked. Please don't let people like this discourage you and surely see the film, investigate the therapy, and make your own judgment."
5,Terrific Movie Highly Recommend,"This is a wonderful pre-code movie. It's a story about the people associated with the tallest building in the world. And in the 1930s that would mean the building was in the United States.Terrific acting, good storyline, very entertaining.This movie can be difficult to find, but it is worth pursuing."
4,Dionysiac,What's objectionable about this book? It doesn't intelligently express the Dionysiac effect of Nietzsche's thought only but whets the mind's appetite for more also. So I give it a four-star rating.
3,"Enjoyable, graceful prose exploring Nietzsche's philosophy.","This is an enjoyable read and presumes a thorough familiarity with Nietzsche's work. Without it you will not appreciate the balanced and graceful way in which Nehamas resolves some of the apparent contradictions inherent in Nietzsche's corpus. Some of the other reviewers suggest Nehamas denigrating Nietzsche's ideas. That is entirely false. In fact, Nehemas writes near the end of this book that Nietzsche's ideas in conjunction with the way he lived his life are ""deeply admirable."" Even if one doesn't agree with the central thesis of the book, that Nietzsche's ideas fit best into a literary model of the world, one can still come away with a much clearer understanding of the philosopher and a greater appreciation for his thoughts."
1,Misrepresentation and lies,"The DVD has sections called 1 Code Unbroken 2 Secrets Unveiled and 3 Cheating Death. The description on the case for the section entitled Secrets Unveiled reads: ""Join some of the world's most famous magicians as they break their vow of silence to reveal their most coveted secrets in Secrets Unveiled"". This is an outright lie -- it is absolutely untrue. There is no revealing of the secrets or revelation of the methods by which the tricks in this section are done.From what I know of Burton, he seems to be a decent guy. I'm guessing that it is the producers and/or marketers of this DVD who are responsible for this dishonesty. Fortunately for me I this is a library DVD. If I had purchased it, I would have returned it and demanded a refund for the false advertising."
1,I Hate Lance,"Spent a wad to see Lance Burton in Vegas. What a total waste. This guy walks through his old, cheap illusions as if in a trance. It's a show of women disappearing and reappearing in various boxes...wow, where have we seen this before? There are no new illusions. Technology has left Lance in a fog.The delivery of his scripted verbiage, that he has probably done thousands of times, seems overly rehearsed. This guy is so slow and mechanical you could scream. Worst of all is the way he womanizes anything that has protruding breasts. I hate this guy. Save your money."
4,Lance Burton is Fantastic,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Lance Burton Secrets of Magic"". It was worth every penny. Actually the DVD is worth more than the asking price. Therefore, do not be fooled by the price because this is a fantastic DVD for people who enjoy magic. My only negative critique is that Lance Burton's Doves and candlesticks routine on the DVD is not as good as the same routine performed on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. However, the routine on the DVD is still delightful. There is an ending section that showcases other magicians. This section is worthwhile and adds to the main entertainment of Lance Burton which comprises the first two sections of the DVD. I recommend this DVD to all who love magic and magicians. But it now!!!"
1,Big and Cheap,These sunglasses are nice looking but as plastic and rather flimsy. I am disappointed that bolle would make sunglasses like this. Also rather large. They did not fit in the overhead sunglasses holder in my car. I would expect to pay $20 for a pair of suglasses like this.
3,Not as good as I hoped,"This books wasn't as good as I anticipated it to be, in fatc, I found it a bit boring. Perhaps it's because I don't really have a lot of interest in baseball, but it wasn't really that great. However, the characters were well-written, but it was easy to guess how the story went, and what happened to Joe after that fateful baseball game he last played in."
4,Enjoyable!,"This is my first SAH book. I do not particularly enjoy baseball, but I was swept up in the race to win the pennant. What can you say about Cordova? Wow! What a hunk. I felt myself saying, as we do often in the South, ""Bless his heart"". I really enjoyed the book and am looking forward to reading the rest of the Brides series."
2,Suprisingly disappointed,"I have to say I was very disappointed in this book. The charcters seemed to have no depth. The idea that a team could go from never even winning a game to taking the pennant was ridiculous. I have read other books by her and have enjoyed them, but this is one I would not reccommend."
5,"Honey, I loved it!",I loved this book. Alex Cordova grabbed my heart on the first page and he didn't let go. Camille Kennison is the perfect match for him. You will laugh at times and be touched deep within your heart at times by this powerful story of love and healing. Read it! You'll love it!
2,NEED IMPROVMENT!,"these boyz need musical track directiona right producer that will orbit them on the the front lines!even though they're rhymes are 86'syle these boyz will neverget where they need to be i dont neccesary compare to N.W.A?oh helllll no! 4 tracks songs are good i love that ""bite down""if they would have kept it on that level they would sell like crazy!but nobody gets it but me so im going to go to itunes and get the onesto ride to and wait on the next album unless they remix the whole thingwhich is dire needed! try again guys!"
2,"So, what's new?","I had high expectation for this book, having had my father die recently, friends losing their parents, and having read a review in the Catholic Spirit. I was disappointed. I became weary of reading names over and over. The Treacy's are a famiy of 8 or 9 and every sibling needed to be listed or identified every time there was somethin to be written. I found it rambling on and on and not insightful in regards to death. My experience with my parents' death was so much more meanigful than this book. I did not need to read of the endless details of who was where when. I was looking for insightfulness, spiritual insightfulness into the experience of having a parent or parents die. I didn't find it. Easy to read, well written though. Maybe a 4th grader would like it, if he could keep the characters straight."
5,I loved it!,Nancy is on a tour of Europe and discovers that their leader is on a secret mission to help 10 refugee children. This is more of a spy mystery but it was very good anyway.
2,Nancy Drew #64,"I almost always give Nancy Drew books 4 or 5 stars. This one was different. I found it very un-realistic, boring, and zero mysteries. It was more of a cheesy spy book. Lots of times you just wondered ""How could she fall for that?"" or ""How could she have trusted him?"" in my opinion. Other people might enjoy this, but I have just read almost all of the Nancy Drew books and they set the mark high, this one was lower."
3,Captive Witness,"This book is really good. Usually, I give 5 stars to Nancy Drew books, but I thought this book could've had more mystery in it. It was *very* suspenseful, though, and it had a good plot. But, honestly, it didn't interest me very much. I got bored with it after a while, because there wasn't much mystery. But read it anyways. You might like it!"
3,a pretty good book,"i liked this book because it was VERY suspenseful and full of surprises. usually i give 5 stars to most of the nancy drew books that i read, but this one probably just deserved 3 stars. the reason is because to me, it didn't have much mystery in it. i mean, it did have mystery, but honestly, i just don't think that it had enough. but, every person is different, so read the book if you want to and see for yourself how you like it!"
1,OFF WITH THE FILMMAKERS HEADS,"Low budget horror film has no real horror and its story of a mysterious woodsman offing some really bad actors has been done many times before and better. Writer/director/producer/co-star Kevin Summerfield obviously collected a few of his friends and attempted to make a cohesive movie. The result is awful. Acting is non-existent and once again they decided to have the most obnoxious character try and be a hero.....oops....Not much here, folks."
5,My kids enjoyed this one.,My kids enjoyed this horror movie very much. I enjoyed it for the fact that it was something they could watch. Which is rare.
1,WORST movie EVER made!!!!!!!,"I don't think ""movie"" is even appropriate for this piece of [...]!!!The entire plot is just ridiculous, crappy. There's VERY bad acting going on and everyone in it is FUGLY (with the exception of Meagan Lopez, she's hot, but still a BAD actress).There's this stupid black guy in it, who's fat and black and he's just nasty.This crap must've been filmed with a webcam, as the image quality is horrible! I mean, even Paris Hilton's night-vision sex video has better image and sound than this. The sound is grainy.Overall, this is just a VERY VERY VERY bad movie. VERY VERY BAD!!!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!But most of all, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!I'd rate it NEGATIVE if I could... it's that bad."
1,What? I can't give a lower rating than 1 star???,"Can a movie possibly be worse than this one? No. This movie stunk eight ways from Sunday. The acting was horrible. The filming was horrible. The plot was horrible. The script was horrible. The whole premise was horrible.The best part of the whole movie was getting to see the various [characters] get killed off.When I die, if I find I wasn't as good as I needed to be, I'll be spending eternity watching this movie."
1,Sleepy Headache,"This is a pretty stinky (...), even if you're someone like me who generally appreciates homegrown horror films on zero budgets. The concept of a Headless Horsemen masked slasher stalking kids at Sleepy Hollow High had promise and certainly interested me enough to purchase the DVD. Sadly, this film seems to wallow in its ineptitude. Since I could tell the crew only had one good light to use, I was terrified that the plot was leading up to night scenes for the climax. My fears came to life as everything became too dark to see and actors spent whole scenes standing in the only available light without being able to move. The documentary and commentary didn't do much to improve my respect for the director, who spends most of the documentary wearing a woman's dress and acting silly. He seems to be trying to imitate either Trey Parker or Ed Wood (or both), but manages to make both look like incredible artists by comparison. Beware!"
2,Why bother?,"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow has been told on the screen time and again, and in many different forms, but I must say that this is a first. In the era of ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""Felicity"", independent film makers have taken the truely scary concept of the hesdless horseman and turned it into a 90-minute teen soap, complete with bad acting and choppy plot. To stay well within the boundaries of teen soap-ville, USA, all of the important storyline factors apply: who is sleeping with who? who is pregnant? a teen, commit suicide because he boyfriend dumped her? It's like the film makers are addicted the the ""Creek"", because every plot twist is torn straight from the television series. To make things worse, a little bit of ""Scream"" and a whole lot of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" is thrown in as well. Add in the cheap look of the film, and cheesy soundtrack, and you're in B-movie heaven. 2 stars, and that's being generous."
1,Worse acting than a Mentos commercial.,"If you've read any of my other reviews, you know I love low budget horror. Unfortunately, this train wreck of a movie is so bad that it isn't even funny. The camera shots are often so dark that you can't tell what is going on. There is one decent killing where big streams of blood squirts from a body like a Monty Python movie, but otherwise there is nothing here to even keep your attention. Negligible gore, no nudity, horrible acting, awful camera work, no originality...... I could go on. I honestly can say that I haven't fast forwarded through very many movies, but after 45 minutes of this stuff I did and you will too! Stay away from this steamer!"
1,Utterly Horrible,If I could I would give this movie negative stars. The costumes: They look like they were made by a middle school drama class. The angles of which it was shot at are horrible and you can never tell what is going on as the screen is practically black all the time. I swear this movie was made with a webcam. I would rather hang myself with my own intestines than watch this again.
1,"Directed by...""Alan Smithee""?","Jesus,Joseph, and Mary! I could not believe how truly awful this ""film"" was. Now, I understand you have to start someplace. Grab your Dad's digital camera and bribe your friends and teachers to bein your movie.We've all done it. Words of advice: Don't ruin a perfect horror legend like Sleepy Hollow. Don't try to copy ""Blair Witch"" or ""Dawson's Creek"". And for the love of God, Do not try to decapitate the blonde using your sister's wig!! And what is with the fat black guy? This was comedy where it was supposed to be terror. I will give one star for the murder weapon: A huge ""Excalibur"" style sword.That was cool. As for the rest of this disaster, the opening scene could not be seen! Literally. The ""acting"" was beyond wooden, and the co-director, Chris Arth, should not have admitted that he ""directed"" at all!"
3,An okay vampire anthology,"Firstly, the book wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional either. Its claim of being ""erotic"" are a little premature. Sure, some of the stories are sexy, but not too many are erotic, and some are just borderline crude (as in bad sex crude, not stimulating crude). I even had to skip over one story (but I came back to it eventually) because it was just that bad.There are some exceptional stories in the book such as Gaiman's short story and Brian Hodge's novella The Dripping of Sundered Wineskin, but most of the stories are only mediocre, and while they're not completely horrible, they're nothing to call home about. If you collect vampire stories as I do, then this isn't a bad addition to the collection, but if you're looking for good vampire erotica, I suggest looking elsewhere."
3,Vampire erotica?,"The stories were fine, but to call it Erotica, is pushing it. If you want a good story, then you'll like this book. If you want Erotic Vampire fiction, I would suggest going elsewhere."
4,"As far as Vampire Erotica goes, this is fantastic!","I thought Love In Vein II was merely 'okay' until I read Brian Hodge's and Pat Califia's submissions. That's what made this book truly amazing. I highly recomend it, though some parts, I admit, are a little inane and repetitive. Once you get hooked, though (and I know you will!), I suggest following with Brite's collection of short stories, ""Wormwood."""
2,"Ok, but could have been much better.","""S. Fackler 'littlebootz'"" could not have said it better. The only reason why I feel I need to add my bit is to reiterate the misnomer of ""Vampire"" Erotica. There are only three stories or so that I felt could qualify. So if you're looking for the stereotype stuff, look elsewhere. Try ""Time of The Vampires"" by P.N. Elrod. You can read my review there. Brite's book is interesting and strange, so for that matter it is a decent read. I'd have to agree once again with S. Fackler regarding the stories I liked and disliked. Read this one with an open mind."
3,Stronger collection than the first Love in Vein anthology,"After reading Love in Vein, I approached Love in Vein II with trepidation. I was pleased to find that this was a collection of strong, imaginative stories. A few of the stories weren't really my taste, but they were all well written.I do have to say that while the stories were almost always about sex in one way or another, I only found a couple slightly erotic. In fact several of the stories are not suited for the squemish -- or the less open-minded.Ignoring the lack of erotica, the collection was quite strong. The opening story, in particular, was brilliant. I won't give the plot away, but it was a clever re-telling of a classic story.If you like vampire stories and you are willing to stretch your definition of 'vampire' you'll probably enjoy these short stories, but don't expect a 'can't put it down' read."
3,less entrancing than the previous collection,"a few gems, but in general a weak collection. my standouts: ""...wineskins"" by brian hodge; ""dusting the flowers"" by david schow, and pat califia (who is just good at erotica period)... this book seems like too many of brite's friends called in a favour."
2,Speed up Sergei,"I love piano concertos by Mozart, and I'm quite dissapointed in this recording. Overall, the sound quality is good and clear, and the orchestra does a fine job. The problem though lies with the pianist, Sergei Uruvayev. His tempo is far too slow at points, and some of his lead-ins to the orchestral parts are noticeable and clunky sounding. For me, I prefer the recordings done by Svetlana Stanceva, whose hands you would absolutely wish to have for playing the piano."
5,finally found it again,"This is an amazing book. I first read it before I began my first world travel in the late 1980s, then passed my dog-eared copy on to a friend from England who was heading to Africa and India on her own. I read it so many times before giving it away that I've memorized portions of the book. In my recent trip to a developing nation, many of Fred's guiding words got me through some tough times with skill. Sound advice and highly recommended. Fred - if you're out there - sure wish you would do an updated version to this guide!"
1,No Big Deal,"This book is a waste! I would advise purchasing ADVANCEED TECHNIQUES for the MODERN DRUMMER by Jim Chapin, the KING of drumming independence and the BEST DAM DRUM INSTRUCTOR ON THE PLANNET!!! After you have successfully concored the book, set your drum set up backwards and start over on page one. You will be amazed how much better you've become!"
4,Pac Man World 3,This is a cool game for PS2. My husband likes it as well as my younger children (under 10). The graphics are pretty cool & it keeps us entertained for hours.
2,2 is waaaaaaaaaaaaay better,"This game is soooo much different then world 2, buy world 2 instead of this, I have like 15 minutes on it and now it's gathering dust."
3,Good...but not as good as Pac-Man World 2,"This game is allright...but not quite as fun as Pac-Man World 2. The graphics are a little better than PM2, but the levels aren't as fun, and what's up with the music? I just think this is a little bit of a step backward from the previous game."
3,automotive A/C evaporator,Took a long time to get here. Have not installed so can not write anything about the function or quality of this product. Price is right!
1,Hubbard only stole ideas,"How To Live Through An Executive is just one more, of many, ideas L Ron Hubbard STOLE from other authors.My suggestion? Don't support it, at all."
1,the worst book ever?,I cannot believe that anyone would give a positive review to this load of garbage.What an enormous waste of my time!
1,Stephen White's arrogance clearly shines through...,Either the writer himself is an arrogant man or has a majestic ability to infuse his narrator with the trait. His clear antipathy for some of his characters breeds an unpleasant experience. This will be my first and last Stephen White book.
1,On and On and On,"I love a good mystery. I hoped I'd discovered another author to add to my collection, but I really struggled to finish this one. Thought frequently of just giving up on it. Too slow moving, too far fetched, too often sliding into unreal and impossible scenarios. And most of all to be a good mystery writer I have a helpful suggestion. Leave out the left-wing liberal politics. That kind of tripe is a real turnoff. (You know not of whom you speak.)"
5,Cold Case: a hot read,"Exciting, interesting, and suspenseful describe the plot of this new novel. White's readers will not be disappointed in the eighth in this series. A conniving politician, an estranged husband, and a woman with a secret contribute to a complicated plot involving the murder of two teenage girls. The case has gone unsolved for years, until a group of experts that solve old or ""cold"" cases as a hobby decide to take on the case. Alan and Lauren are asked to be consultants for this group of criminologists and get more involved than they expect."
1,Well written and dreadfully dull,"I appreciate good writing, I really do. This novel delivers that; White brings the characters alive quite well and weaves a good narrative that ties them all together naturally with very believable encounters. The trouble is, there's nothing interesting about them. It's a dull story, and that's really disappointing. I don't think I'm going to give up on White as an author, maybe I just chose the book to get acquainted with him."
2,Remarkably boring,"I bought this book (the Kindle version) on the strength of the first chapter which I read as a sample. The first chapter was promising. Unfortunately, after that it gets boring, more boring, most boring.Essentially, it's 'talking heads'. A long boring meeting with boring characters making boring presentations and giving longwinded explanations is followed by another boring meeting with people explaining stuff, followed by yet more meetings... I'm sure you get the picture.I like Stephen White's other novels; indeed, I consider some of them to be masterpieces. 'Cold Case' is not among them.Compared with his other novels, this one is dull.I'm giving it two stars because the style is polished the grammar is correct.No stars for plot, pacing, action or conflict."
1,Disappointed,"I had read one other book by White, Harm's Way, which was adequate for airline travel but Cold Case was really a disappointment.The plot could have been enthralling but it was ruined by thinly developed characters that were presented either as good or bad people. The writing was incredibly simple and most of the book became very predictable.This was not much of a read, and I wondered whether or not the title was selected to confuse potential buyers that it might be "" A Cold Case"" which is a book worth reading. Don't bother with this one."
1,Cold Case,"This started out good and moved along pretty quickly. The review by Kirkus says that there were oddball and quirky characters who couldn't put their past behind them. I don't think the characters were developed enough to support that, though. The author didn't give them that depth. However, the book failed dismally at the end. It was like someone yelled ""Go"" and all of the characters started confessing. I still can't figure out how smart people followed the bad guys into the night and why the author would think they would have done that. And what's with the unknown car at the neighbor's house? Lots of mention but no explanation. A disappointing read."
1,Poor Man's Kellerman,"Sterotypical charachters, average plotting, nowhere near the talent of Jonathan Kellerman. White seems intent on demonizing conservatives rather than concentrating on character development. If you're into psychologists who solve murder mysteries, buy Kellerman instead."
4,Enjoyable thriller,"Stephen White is another novelist in the Jonathan Kellerman vein, and while he lacks a colorful sidekick like Milo of the Alex Delaware series, his psychological background comes to the fore throughout this novel. Alan Gregory is a bit of a cipher since you never really can figure him out. His first person viewpoint reaches out and fleshes out the various people running through the story, but he's rarely introspective enough to get a real good fix on him. That, and the bad guys are as obvious as the nose on your face. Still, this was a good read with a quick moving plot that never bored me. His knowledge of the terrain in Colorado was also an advantage. I never had any problem envisioning any of the beautiful scenery and the description of the ranch house made me want to see it for myself.Will I read more in this series? Probably. And I will definitely recommend it to anyone needing a good beach book."
3,DO NOT READ REVIEW IF YOU HAVE NOT READ BOOK,"I usually like the Alan Gregory novels, but I don't understand why the editor did not catch one glaring error. Why would the Franklin family help fund the Locard investigation to reopen this case? This family must be really stupid."
3,"Pretty Good, Not Great","I've read several Stephen White novels now. I generally like his writing and characters. If you have read and enjoyed other Stephen White books, you won't be disappointed by ""Cold Case."" If you haven't, here's the low down on ""Cold Case""--the plot and character developement is good, the ending falls a little flat. Overall, it's worth reading."
2,So So,"Lots of pieces looking like left over treats from the rejects on the manufacturing line. The dogs like them, but they like any treat. One of my dog's digestive system disagrees with some of these treats. I would not recommend them or purchase them again."
1,Dogs reacted bad,my dogs started to throw up after eating a few stick. called the number listed on the jar but the guy who picked up didn't speak english. I had to throw out the rest of the jar.
2,Dogs won't eat these!!,"I have 3 dogs, with 2 who normally eat anything and everything. They won't touch these. I haven't found a treat in the Bucket that they'll eat. They love the Smokehouse chicken strips and chips, but they hate these!! Very disappointing!!!"
1,Not good for the dogs,"There are so many wrong things about this product. First of all, when I received it, it was not fully sealed. Then, when I read the packaging it said ""100% natural FLAVORING"". It is not 100% natural. Then, they smelled worse than any other dog treats I have ever given my dogs but since its dog food and not human food, I still gave some treats to my dogs which resulted in a couple of days of the worst diarrhea and gas they have ever had. I had only given them a couple of treats each, which they did seem to enjoy, but in the end, I threw the entire bucket away."
2,Smelly and odd,"My first hint that I might not be re-ordering was the caution on the package to ""wash hands with soap and water"" after handling the treats. I've never seen that before. Hmm. The things inside the container looked like some kind of circus side-show of the treat world. They smell strange, and look like butcher-store offal.I understand that dog treats come from the discarded parts of animals, but this product makes it very clear that these are nowhere near what we normally think of as ""food."" There were some bits (unidentifiable) that the dog would not eat, though she would eat most of them. She doesn't seem to be any more enthusiastic about these than any other kind of treat, though.And I don't like carrying a few in my pocket on walks, because some are great big tube-like things and some are tiny stick pieces. And of course then I spend the whole walk wanting to wash my hands. It's just a strange, creepy assortment, and I don't think I'll be getting this product again."
1,May not be what you want for your dog,"These dog treats are very poor quality, many of the casing are empty, the are dried out and very ununiform in size. May fit the saying ""wouldn't feed it to my dog."""
2,Not much of a mix,There were only 2 kinds of treats in this bucket. I got the sausages and tendons. My dog loves the sausages but not the tendons. This was supposed to have 4 kinds of treats in it.
4,A Nice Treat,"My dogs really seem to like these. They never let them sit on the floor, and are always begging for more."
1,"Awful,Smells, and made my Dogs Sick",Just plain nasty. It's like all waste product. I wouldn't wish these treats on anyone.
5,Well worth the $$,I would highly recommend this nailer over the senco pin nailer. We have two of the senco nailers and can't keep them from jamming (I use other Senco nailers and have never been disappointed with their performance-so I'm not trying to knock Senco). So far the Bostich has held up fine. I like the adjustable depth gauge (based on wood species) and the safety control. I use it to install hardwood cabinet trim and so far it has held up good. It will shoot a longer pin nail than its competitors but I am not sure how true it will shoot through hardwood without blowing out the side-I will give it a try when I can locate the longer pins. Good luck.
2,bostitch pin nailer,"This is a nice tool, the nails are difficult to see since they are so thin. The only problem is that the 1 3/16 nails are almost impossible to find retail. The nails are available thru Amazon.com."
1,????????????????,"I purchased my nailer two months ago along with an orderfor pins. I have waited for the pins only to betold that I will have to wait another month ""at least"" toreceive them.I've ""explored the internet"" and talked with Bostitchfor vendors who could supply me with 23 gauge pins. Onlyone replied that they could if I would buy 480,000 pinsof a particular size.I chose ""this"" nailer because of it's ability to shoot3/8"" pins and the availibility is poor. I have been unableto get ANY pins so far."
3,holds up well,"Hey i just rediscoverd this gem and played it in my car this past week August 2012 and it sounded great. Andy is a talened musician and clever songwriter.He surrounds himself with good musicians. There are plenty of moments that make me smile and a few that are very touching. i think that's why i like ""God Loves a Joke"" best. Really good song.Babs Parent passed away some years back and its a good thing her voice was captured for this recording."
2,"Cute, but breaks easily","I really liked this night light because it matched our set. We put it up for our new daughter and our one year old son touched it and it broke. It is nice to have the light bulb included as many other night lights do not have this feature, but if you have other little ones around be weary. It will probably break very easily for you as well."
2,Broken,"I love the night light but like others mine broke with just a simple touch. It is sooo adorable, as long as, you don't turn it on. Save your money and don't buy it!!"
2,"Super cute, but shattered before I could even plug it in!","My mother gave me this sweet little night light at my baby shower. It's super cute, but it's EXTREMELY FRAGILE. The glass-ceramic bug is held to the base by a very flimsy wire prong. Handle with care over a carpeted surface.I broke this little night light when I tried to snap it together after my baby shower. The little bug hit our hardwood floor and shattered into pieces. I never even had the chance to plug it in. I felt so badly about breaking my mom's gift that I ordered a replacement from Amazon. ($5.95 shipping cost... grrr.) I feel a little better now after reading the other reviews, because it looks like it wasn't just me being clumsy.When I receive the replacement, I'm going to wire or glue the decorative bug cover to the night light base and place a rug under it. With luck, the replacement may survive being outside of the box for longer than two minutes."
5,An instant classic,I had never seen this movie before I bought it but a older friend of mine suggested it one day and amazon had it. Jekyll and Hyde together again is almost as funny as it gets. Really good acting from main character. I thought it was hilarious and would definitely recomend it to anyone who likes comedy. Movie quality of blu-ray was awesone!
1,Ivory Tower Hot Air,"This book screamed: ""Those that can, do; those that can't teach and write books like this."" In a day and age when marketing, thanks to the reach of the Internet, has reached new heights in ingenuity this book is ingenuous and stuck in the 80s. With all the dot.coms there has to be a ton of proven marketing whiz kids who can teach all of us a trick or too. Instead, we have a fuddy-duddy professors who have no experience in today's marketing dynamics and techniques trying to tell us what they think it is all about. Where is the credibility?"
3,not the complete episodes,"If you are looking for uncut episodes, this is not the video to buy. Even though they have added the last few minutes of the program which is usually cut on TV, bits have been cut out of the middle of the episodes. I was very disappointed."
3,Good!,"This is a funny classic sitcom! I have seen a lot of reruns on TVLand and I liked them. This tape has a lot of good episodes, including some with The Darlings and Ernest T. Bass. This show also has some complete seasons on DVD but to be honest I don't want to own every episode on DVD but I would ove to own all of the episodes with The Darlings and all of the episodes with Ernest T. Bass on DVD. I would definitely buy a DVD with every episode with the Darlings and every episode with Ernest T. Bass!"
5,Couldn't live without it,"If you have trouble dropping your 2-3 year old off at daycare (morning freeplay), send him in with one of these, they just think they are really cool and since it's learning, the teachers don't care. All the kids shut up and watch/share."
1,I am confused....,"I only see 6 build activates not 100 tools, games and activities as it is being advertised. Their statement about number of tools, games, etc. is misleading. Many activities are very limited. This is very frustrating and I feel cheated.""Streaming video capabilities"" Ahh...This is a capability, not something you can use out of the box. You need to buy some software???""Create your own shows with cartoon creator, video creator and scene creator software"" Sounds promising. I have yet to see it.OK, I spent 10 minutes playing with this item and I am disappointment. I paid only $10 for this and I think it is now worth it. I do not intend to buy additional cartages to get those 100 activities.It got 3 stars for durability as I can't rate this attribute after playing with it for 10 minutes."
2,Little educational value,Hardware seems promising but the included software only allows for drawing software. The software you can buy only provides for some limited functionality with cartoon viewing. No really good educational software.
4,Very good to start,"This is my first set, and it has been a very good adquisition. It has specially a very good putter and probably I will keep them until I reach below 100. The bag has enough pockets."
3,nice color pop for location,I bought this to bring out a dark corner of my room. It works well and is a great addition to my dragon themed bathroom.
3,poster is fine,"This poster will be a gift for my 7 year old son who likes dragons. He will like it. I was hoping it was bigger, but I didn't focus enough on the dimensions when I bought it."
2,Nothing to see here ..,"Hawkwind can put on one of the best stage shows you'll ever see .. this is not one of them. Why is the film so dark - did the band play in the dark or was it just aweful video filming? The editor attempts to gloss the video with special effects, but fails horribly .. kinda like how you spill tomato sauce on a white shirt and attempt to clean it with paper and water which results in spreading the stain to a larger area, so the editing attempts to improve the original pictures just make more of a mess.The sound isn't bad. This is not the best Hawkwind line up, but I've heard worse.Worth listening to for Micheal Morrcock's narrations.Les."
4,Fresh Ears ONly,"If you are a die hard Hawkwind Freak, you CAN'T like this DVD but if you can listen to this with out any preconceptions of what hawkwind should sound like, if you can just listen too the music on its own merits you will judge this to be a great piece of musical genious. I had the good fortune too have live chronicals be the first hawkwind album I owned. I bought it because I liked the cover. It rocks. The studio album of the same songs is the worst piece of garbage ever made. No other hawkwind album is like this so loyal hawkwind freaks can't hang with the polished guitar licks and clean musicianship heared here they are too accustomed too the freaked out distortion and endless mind numbing drones and chants that make early hawkwind some of the best music to listen to when you are really drunk."
5,amazine cd,"I dont even like much hardcore music. In general I stick to screamo, emo, and punk. However, this is probably one of my favorite cds. With fast drumming, fun and catchy guitar riffs, why not listen to it. Fast drumming could almost redeem hoobastank. Also, the vocals and gang choruses in this album are astoundlingly great. If I could find one person who could sing as well as he does, I would pay them money, which I dont have, to play in a band with me. one of my friends hadnt even listened to them before and bought it, and right away liked it. And this guy listens to rap. Thats how good this cd is.BUY IT"
2,change for the worse....,"Anyone that picked up 'Turn It Around' when it came out were all completely amazed. I had heard they got on victory, a label that has all screamo bands on it. I really didn't have too much of a problem with it because they were all about true hardcore music. However, listening to wake the dead, had certainly changed my thoughts on Comeback Kid. The music sounds overproduced, and his voice is completely different from TIA. I've played it at work before and kids were asking, ""Is this the new Sum41 CD!?!"" I also admired the songwriting on the first cd, but I noticed that the words have weakened. I guess all you can say is 'oh well'. Bottom line, you can definitely see the influence of victory records on this new album. I think I'll just stick with listening to Turn It Around."
1,I dont see how these guys are so good!,"some people say these guys rock and they are totally hardcore. Whoever says that is wrong. These guys dont even sound like As I Lay Dying or Underoath, and I cant believe people relate Comeback Kid to them. Comeback Kid is just a wanna bee screaming hardcore band. They think they are cool but they really arent. There music is full of yelling. Its like this guy wants to scream, but he cant. What kind of a band substitutes screaming for yelling? If you ask me, these guys suck!! As I Lay Dying and Underoath are real metal and hardcore and are way better than these wimps!"
5,Awesome !!,"I totally recommend these Bic pencils, they really work great, comfortable to write with. i cant suggest any other mech pencil to use!!!"
2,A little disappointing,"Most of this are not old questions. I thought it was too focused on artificial intelegence and too little on ethics, leading a good life and other age old questions."
1,Unchained Melody,"We had originally wanted to purchase Ronnie McDowell's Unchained Melody and instead we received Andy Williams' Unchained Melody, which was not what we wanted. We returned it and again ordered Ronnie McDowell and for a second time we received Andy Williams. We returned this one as well and have not ordered anything since."
4,geotrax,"My son Loves his geotrax, he askes for as soon as he wakes up. I'm sure this may wear off in time but since Christmas, he can't get enough of it. The bridge is a fun add on especially the caboose. It had a bell that goes off when it rolls. He loves it."
4,Very In-Depth,"Bought this book as I was going to work on a tanker for the first time. If you just want a basic overview of tanker ships and whatnot, this book is a bit much to digest. if on the other hand you are looking at making a career on tankers or studying for the Tankerman PIC endorsement, then this book is right up your alley.It is up-to-date and is a must have for those who will work in the deck department of a tanker ship or on-board tank barges including ATB's."
1,Doesn't work for long!,"This item worked for about 2 minutes, then stopped altogether. Contacted seller - quick response, however have to pay return shipping AND a 25% restocking fee. Not sure what that is all about - asked seller but got no response."
4,Automatic Hot Dog Roller,"I bought 2 units. One unit works well but one unit has problems - center shaft is a hair short so the rollers do not always turn as advertised. One slight modification to unit would be to make it a bit longer so you can cook 1 ft dogs. It does well with the typical 6-8 inch dogs that one would buy in a supermarket but too short for those who want to cook the 12 inch dogs.Overall, the unit is good. No longer have to turn the hot dogs manually and they cook much more evenly with the automatic roller."
1,Item broke,"The hot dog grill roller stopped working within 5 minutes of using it. Tried to contact seller, but got no answer, so therefore, no refund. Order at your own risk."
5,Sox & the City,"timely & funny, as a long time Sox fan I could relate to many of the descriptions in Roeper's book. The book gives a different perspective from a so called non sportswriter or jock. I would highly recommend it for hard core Sox fans."
4,Brian K. Vaughan Rocks!,"I started reading Y: The Last Man about two years ago and have been hooked on this guy's writing since. I've been trying to pick up as much of his work as I can find and this is one of the most satisfying ones I've come across. It presents a fairly unique situation, as far as comics go at least, involving a superhero who decided to move into politics.If politics bore you to death.... it doesn't really matter, the book is still a great read!"
2,Not worth it,The four experiments you see there is what you get 3 times. I thought there would be 12 assorted experiments. Two of the experiments you can use common household items. The other two (microscope and telescope) don't really work all that well. At that price it's really not worth it. Go to the local grocery store and invest in a bottle of glue and starch for the gooey and for the crystal get a box of borax. Total comes to well under $50 dollars.
5,Gorgeous tiles!,"These tiles are absolutely gorgeous, the price is fantastic, and the delivery was speedy. One thing: the green color in the actual tiles is more pronounced than it appears in the photo, but the tiles are beautiful nevertheless."
4,good look at all sorts of predators large and small,"This book discusses all predators, great and small, their place in their local ecology, their places in the myths and memories of people from the ancient to modern, etc. It ranges from the Saber-toothed tiger down to modern rats. It highlights four species, the Romanian brown bear, the Aussie saltwater croc, the Siberian tiger, and the Asian lion, but those four are only the beginning, acting as a launching point for many interesting digressions. It's an interesting book. I recommend it."
1,A dull and deeply prosaic book,"The author's imagination is just not up to the task he has set himself. I was seduced into buying this be the promising title, alas, it is easily the best thing about this book."
3,"Well-made and makes system more compact, but not so necessary.","I like how the balance of the camera is improved - the weight of the flash on the right makes the hand grip more of the center of gravity of the whole system. It also eliminates the top-heaviness of the flash on the hotshoe. And it would also seem to make the flash less vulnerable to breaking off the hotshoe mount, although I've only broken one in many years of professional shooting.One issue is that it makes your subjects more vulnerable to redeye since it's so close to the lens. Not a big deal in these Photoshop days, but still a hassle. In the end, I thought it to be pretty expensive for a relatively simple machined plate that doesn't make an improvement in the photos. After shooting a live event recently, I took it off halfway and put the flash back on top of the camera."
3,Interesting bracket idea,A little pricy but very well made. A good lightweight option for the travel photographer. They make some great other products as well.
3,Fun stuff,"I bought this many years ago and not a December goes by that I don't have it playing all the time. Lots of ""noodling around"" on piano etc. Granted there are a few that don't suit me, but four or five are very fun and just might have you dancing around the house."
5,A must own video!,"If you love Hanson as much as I do you need to own this video. These guys have proven themselves to be accomplished musicians, and this video showcases their talent beautifully! These guys are no longer the ""little boys"" that came squeaking at us with ""mmmbop"" ( no offense I T & Z!) They have grown in their love for the craft and each new song proves that! They definately fill a void where all ""Boy Bands"" are concerned. I don't think they should be compared to or grouped with such bands. In this video they each will show you the true heart of a musician!"
5,Hanson rocks the world away,I saw this concert on direct t.v. and I also went to both thier concerts and this the best video I love it a lot I also love the concert too it was the BOMB I was so happy when I found out that they are caming here and I got tickets to go and see them because I love the concert a lot they did an awesome job at the concerts.So every Hanson fan should have this video and go and see it because then you will love it a lot they did an awesome job on at the concerts and both of the concerts I went tooI also was watching the video getting ready for the concert so then I will know what they might be doing at the concert.
1,Not Again,"I used to be a huge Hanson fan, so I bought At the Fillmore yesterday, and I was really disappointed. They sounded horrible and had many many many obvious mistakes. The 1 star is for their goofy personalities. Things they said cracked me up, and I think that that is the only reason that someone should buy it. It was definatly not the best show they've ever done, and I think that it does nothing to showcase the talent that they (might) have."
3,Some of the songs are entertaining + The sound recording is not clear + No subtitle,I like three of the songs of this DVD.The sound recording is not clear. What I hate the most is it has no subtitle. Consequently I find it's hard for me to sing along my favorite songs.
3,If you like this kinda thing...,"I'd like to give this game three and a half stars,since only three is kinda harsh,but it isn't deserving of four stars in my opinion.This is a game like spyro and crash bandicoot;collect so much stuff from each level,go back if you've missed a few things etc. etc.It's kinda silly,kinda fun and I'm sure there's alot of gameplay value in this title...I just really couldn't get into this game.The mad scientist Dr. Muto is a little annoying;I really wanted to like him,since I think mad scientists are the coolest,but I just couldn't.One thing I didn't like was his voice;it sounded like Bert from Bert and Ernie on Seasame Street.Also seeing him do the swim or that Russian dance during the load times got old.I guess I was expecting him to be more like Dr.Willy from the Megaman series...By far this isn't a bad game,but it just didn't do much for me.Maybe it was just a little too silly for me,but I'm sure there are others out there who would like it."
1,Bad programming makes this game hang up.,"I liked this game so much that I tried 3 different copies of the game on two different Playstation 2 consoles. It always hangs up and freezes maybe in 10 minutes maybe after 2 hours. This kind of quality is totally unacceptable, and this is the first time I have ever had this happen on a console with 20 years of gaming. That's too bad, the game has a very interesting and original concept and very interesting visuals, for a platformer."
1,horrible,"i bought this game today and i liked it at first. it may be fun, but nothing ever happens. first, it takes 2 hours to get to the second save point and it takes looong time to get different morphs and gadgets. i am very disappointed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
2,TOO MUCH TALKING!!,"this ""game"" , is like watching a mini cartoon movie! The gameplay is CONFUSING, with not enough direction of mission. Oh, well, we don't know till we actually BUY the games, Right?"
3,"Some fun, but not a lot of fun","The Kids liked building the track and watching the train run but did not like the fact that it had no speed control or reverse. Train runs in one direction only and is either stopped or running, no in between."
5,Signals,"Joel has expressed his feelings and findings about life after death and the love of friends so terrifically. ""Signals"" is a spell binding and beautiful book. It will inspire you and lift your spirit to new heights..you will not regret purchasing this book.. You feel that you personally know Joel once you've read it..I do. I have recommended it to several friends and they have passed the good news of this book on to others. Try it....you'll love it.. I can hardly wait for Joel's next book.."
5,Fantastic book!!!!,"This was an excellent book, and I think it should be a best seller!! Easy reading and this has helped me to recognize my signals!"
5,Inspiring and heart warming!,"This book came to me in a very serindipitous manner. When I read it, I realized that maybe it wasn't so ""coincidental"" as I'd originally thought! This book provided me with so much hope and peace, and validation that our loved ones are safe, happy and still with us, that my heart was bursting with joy! This book is one to read again and again, to remind yourself that the most important thing in life is LOVE!Thank you Joel, for your courage to tell the TRUTH, by sharing this story."
3,"Good book, but makes you ponder its credibility","I have read different books on similar topics of life after death such as books by George Anderson and John Edwards, ""Signals"" I thought was good but made me question certain sections of the book. What I found skeptical was how he could remember word for word what Albert had revealed to him in his visitations. Overall I thought it was an interesting and personal perspective on the topic, like other readers I found it a quick read which was enjoyable nonetheless."
2,"A Review of the Ladybird ""Peter and the Wolf""","This book is rather dreadful. The language is stilted and somehow the comradeship amongst the characters is entirely lost.An example of how stilted the flow of the text is follows:""Peter played with his hatin the meadow.The bird sang up in the tree.A duck cameinto the meadow.She looked at the waterand went for a swim.""At a level 4, I would have expected better flow. And, of course, the character development and 'comradeship' between the characters is severely hindered by this unfortunate writing.Two Stars. At the moment we have no book version of 'Peter' to recommend, but for a fine introduction to the classic Prokofiev tale, we highly recommend Sesame Streets video with the Boston Pops."
2,Good Collection Bad Performances and Recordings,"This is a good collection of various pieces of music written by the genius who was Johann Strauss. However as is the case with so many classical collections this CD has terrible recordings and bad performances. Then again I guess you get what you pay for, seeing as how this CD was 4.27 when I published this review, I guess in a way that makes this CD an okay deal since it does give you a good taste of what Strauss' style was like. Personally, if I hadn't been given this CD I'm not sure I would have bought it."
5,Johann Strauss,This is exactly the music I was looking for. Johann Strauss & The Blue Danube plus his other waltzes are now in my heart again. I'm 68 and remember hearing his music when I was a child.
2,OZ,"I HAVE TWO OF THESE REELS, ONE WORKS OK THE OTHER THE SPRING SLIPS AND IT DOESN'T RETRIEVE THE FLY LINE."
5,Brings Back My Childhood Days,This book was read to a group of kids (of which I was one) at summer day camp back in the 1950's. It was a pleasure to see it still in print and to read it myself.
3,The Sell Your Novel Tool Kit,"I'm still working my way through this book. I'm so tired of giving money to the ""how-to-write-and- publish-a-book-industry"" without ever really getting a book written, published and sold. To tell you the truth, I won't have any idea whether I was suckered into another sale or that this is truly a good resource for another couple of months. I really want to produce and sell not hand over more money.Rating this book at this point is like taking an art class and being told by the teacher that, ""you're not really a good artist."" Excuse me. That's why I'm taking the class. Sheesh.With that analogy in mind, finding an agent who will, and I mean who will, work with me rather than lecture me or blow me off is a big piece of the puzzle as well. I've had a life time of that crap. I can see why some agents and editors accuse some writers of not being a ""people person."""
3,"DOOM II, another green-blooded slaughter-fest!","Doom II is the eight best FPS for GBA and the 8th released for the system. Doom is an awesome game, Doom II is an awesome. Which one is better. It's a tie! They both are so good that there is no dividing line. Doom II features more of the same running-and-gunning gameplay, finding switches and keys to open doors, and blasting everything away that moves. However, there are new enemies, a new weapon, and more levels than the original. Unlike the first Doom port which had some elements from it's original PC version missing, the Doom II port has everything intact! Get ready for another green-blooded slaughter-fest!"
2,You really need some hours to play this,"Look for a few hours the game is fun if you enjoyed it on the pc; actually I completed the game on pc, but somehow the controls don't add up to the addictive playability i had expected. Glad that i sold the game.Problem of the game is you can't save, only inbetween levels. This means playing over and over a level and each one is quite big, so a replay of 1 level takes half an hour easily.Either rent it, or buy it for max $10 (and sell it for $10 some weeks later) - I did."
4,Eagleview 8-24x25 Prism Binoculars by Nikon,"Nice Compact size, focus nob is toward front which results in using middle or ring finger for focusing and index finger for zooming. Takes some getting used to. Eyeglass wearers may find it difficult to use, i.e., finding a good spot where both left & right images come completely together. Image becomes darker as zoom in. Not suitable for use in low light conditions (dawn or dusk) at middle to full zoom. I predominantly use them to spot arrows when shooting target archery. It's light weight, size and limited view field are ideally suited for this purpose."
3,Hard to focus,"These binocs are good with optics, but to hard to adjust for viewing. The dial for changing magnification is to easy to slide around."
4,Great little binocs,"These are nice binocs. The lens caps don't stay on like others have noticed, and, like all magnifiers, as your zoom in the brightness dims (it's just physics), but overall they are a nice pair and can fit in a painters pants pocket."
4,Very versatile and compact for an ok price,"These binoculars are perfect for a versatile use! We go hiking 2 or 3 times a month and everything fits easy in the car and backpack. The variable zoom does allow for an overview of whats in front of us and to also see what kind of animal is sitting in the next tree. For beeing a Nikon product the quality feels below expectaions but does the job. The focus adjustment feels strong and smooth while the lever for the zoom leaves a questionnable impression.A great piece for the versatile and weekend user, if you look for highest comfort and more regular use get something else."
4,As expected,"Wanted to replace an old, probably inexpensive binoculars but did not need or want to pay for great binoculars. That's exactly what I got. I'm happy but not thrilled."
1,Made in China,"Had I known this product was made in China I would not be in the process of having them repaired by nikon, I would have passed. Made in China, repaired in America."
1,Poor customer service,I received these binoculars on Monday. On Thursday the plastic eye cup protector broke in half and now the separate pieces won't stay on the eye cups. I called Nikon and they will sell me a new one but not replace the defective piece. I will not buy any Nikon product again!
5,Indispensable,"This marvelous little book offers a parallel and human voice to the more academic books about Vietnam.There is no ""agenda"", here just a selection of moving, articulate, impassioned voices talking about their experiences and feelings at the time they were there. Some of the most moving, of course, being those from young people who would die shortly thereafter. We see through the letters in the book that even on the front lines this ""war"" was seen through a wide diversity of opinions, from those that were totally committed to it, and why (though they tend to become less prevalent as the years pass), to those who came to believe it was not a worthy effort to justify the consequences. And the majority, just confused. A must read."
4,an excellent guide unless you want to shop,"I used this guide for a business trip + 2 days sightseeing in Madrid in December of 2008.Largely it is excellent - good for finding hotels, restaurants, clubs, museums. It gives excellent advice about getting around the city and has some nice walks (I took the one through old Madrid -- quite good and informative). The maps are also very good (though small type -- reading them at night under weak Madrid street lamps proved tough).The one place it failed me was shopping -- I wanted to bring back a few truly spanish/truly madrid items for Christmas presents for family and friends. Yet the guide points towards the core shopping districts which are largely filled with your standard EU department stores and chain shops. There was a good pointer to a ceramics store -- but for the rest I had to rely on guides from tourist information in Madrid (which pointed me to excellent local shops)."
4,Dr. Price's cook book,"This 1921 cook book is a real hoot! The perfect source for adding ""delightful variety and... reduced cost of supplying the table."" This was written before ovens had thermometers so you will have to guess at what is meant by a ""hot"" or ""moderate"" oven. Check out ""How to Clean Poultry"" on page 34 and you may become a vegan."
1,"Pitifully POOR quality, afraid to take it to 700+ degrees for lead","Poorly cast, has several places where there was porosity ( blistering ) when cast. a major thin spot ( dimple ) the size of the pad on your index finger near the bottom. Has grinder dibits on places the MFG. must have thought were too bad to let go. The handle is off center so when picked up by it the pot tips maybe 15 degrees or more. Am afraid to take it to the melt temp I need to cast lead at 700+ degrees. The pot was listed at 4 1/2"" deep, what a farce ! inside depth is less than 3 inches ! If you measure the height taking into account the little feet on the bottom that keeps it from setting flat it measures a mere 4 1/4"" high total. Stamped made in China on the bottom . They must be grinning thinking we actually buy these. I didnt expect it to be of lodge quality, just functional. I expected too much. Am afraid to return it for an exchange. This may be the GOOD ONE !"
1,Ok book to read,"It took me a while to get into the book, all the way the chapter 20, and it does frustrate you with all constant repeats of everyones first and last name. I do believe this is my first and last book that I will read by this author."
2,So what?,"Now I've tried to make it a point to read any book that I picked out at least to the 61st page, but I got to Page 58 and just returned it. I don't believe the writer is a bad writer, it's just the author failed with one very important detail. I MUST CARE ABOUT THE DEAD PERSON! By page 58, I really didn't know more than three short things about the boy who died--he liked nice boots, he played basketball well, and he liked roofs. Wow, now I really care who killed him. WRONG! I found out more detail about the cops than I did about the victim, and definitely more about the killer. Isn't that a little backwards? I couldn't hang."
5,Fantastic Collection,"This is my favorite collection of Indian cooking. The recipes cover a wide variety of foods, including soups, appetizers, rice, veggie dishes, and meat dishes. I particularly love the rice and cauliflower dishes. My friends are always impressed when I make a feast of Indian food from this cook book. The pictures are great too. The only criticism I have is that the recipes are written in the metric system."
2,Put your reading glasses on!,"I bought this book as a gift for someone who's a big fan of Robert Kennedy. I have to say I was disappointed in the font size--extremely small print. Unfortunately, I don't even know if my friend will be able to read this book. I can't speak to the content because I, myself, have not read it."
4,As good as the cover.,"I enjoyed this sequal even more than the first book. I found it a deep and detailed insight into Agnes and her life as her children leave home and then return. I developed a lot of sympathy with the character of Agnes.I actually read this book first and then went to get the first book. I was a little surprised that some events in the second book were not built up to in the first. I did not get the impression that Agnes husband was in any way unstable in the first novel, but in the second Agnes suspects that he committed suicide.I loved the cover of this book as well as the content. The Scofield family were really brought to life. The descriptions of the families interactions were so real and I could really imagine being there with them at their family gatherings."
5,"Lovely, lovely book",Robb Forman Dew is a consummate artist who writes with love and authority about family life in small-town Ohio in a by-gone era. Her expertly drawn world wraps around you like a cocoon; her memorable characters make you laugh and cry. Superb.
1,Like eating sawdust,"I may be at somewhat of a handicap, as I did not read the previous book (""The Evidence of Her Guilt"") where these characters were introduced. I can only comment on the stand-alone qualities of ""The Truth of the Matter"" and they are not praiseworthy. I found this book to be a real struggle. I had no empathy with any of the characters and found them to be quite lifeless and even unlikable. Rarely one to give up on any book, I kept on reading, hoping that something would happen; a plot twist, or even a plot for that matter. I searched for any sign that one of these characters might be, if not intriguing at least interesting, but when I finally reached the last page, I resigned myself to the fact that I had wasted my time on this one. I might just as well have read the phone book for its entertainment value."
1,Dissatisfaction,"Theoritically it is very good solution for car PC applications because of 2 composite video inputs and 1 VGA port; but just theoritically !I bought one, installed it, had first experience and disappointed too much! Mixing colours, unsharp images, imaginary colour flames flying on the screen.. I couldn't get any improvements by adjusting screen settings.. I couldn't get any support from the seller, named VIVITEQ..There is no a good documentation, no drivers for VGA usage,no support..The only recommendation for Lilliput and VIVITEQ: Stay away from them !"
5,One Piece: Collection Six,"I think that one piece is the best pirates anime ever the straw hats crew are so coolAnd can I ask anyone how will read this review region 1 dvds or boxset, can they be watch on blu-ray. And Whenever I watch power rangers turbo on the blu-ray player a square box on the tv screen said (NTSC) does that mean i can watch NTSC Dvd or boxset."
3,what?,If there going to come out with more one piece collection like this than it better be english dubbed because only having english subtitles is just lame and not very enjoyable in my opinion.
2,Gardening for dummies,I expected more simply because I have used these books on other topics and found them very helpful. Not so much for this topic.
1,Gardening for Dummies,"I bought this book primarily for information on weed control. It gives very little other than how to control weeds in a ""humane"" manner. Specifically I wanted info on what herbicides to use and when. The book dismisses the subject stating it doesnt recommend them."
4,a good start,I bought this book because I wanted to learn a little about everything that had to do with gardening. And that's exactly what it does. My dissappointment in the book is that there aren't more pictures. I wish it would have a picture with the description of the different flowers. But otherwise it is a great book.
2,At Least it Has Barney,"Call me a crybaby, but I couldn't get over the fact that the music is not the original music. I had to fast forward each intro due to the horrible tune. Yuck! At least the shows feature Barney.One thing to look out for is that many if these DVDs have the same episodes, just recycled into different packaging. I found this out after I bought ""The Best of the Andy Griffith Show"" and ""The Best of Barney"" in an Amazon package deal. Those 16 episodes are the same as the 16 on ""The Best of the Andy Griffith Show 16 Episodes"". Oh well. (The later DVD set is much better.)"
5,Collapse of an Mandarin Family,"This is a fascinating story of the collapse of an ancient and honorable Chinese family under the impact of Japanese occupation and Communist perfidy. The author traces his early life, an incredible kidnapping, and his final decision to flee Shanghai. I was glued to every page."
4,Nice for the Price,Needed the ability to transport some pallet materials and also dig and carry some larger rocks in my property. Attached these to a John Deere 2210 tractor with the stock FEL. I had no problem lifting right up to the maximum my FEL will lift. The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is that when applying lateral force they will tend to shift a bit / tilt. It didn't keep me from using them and they're a great value and a real nice upgrade to a stock Front end loader for a small utility tractor.Made in USA is nice as well - Support our workers!
1,Expired shampoo was obviously tampered with,I have no complaints about the product except for it's lack of availability. This is what lead me to search for the Tomlyn Iodine shampoo in the first place. The shampoo works great on skin conditions.The bottle I purchased was cheap in all sense of the word. It did not cost much but was previously opened and obviously watered down. The shampoo was also set to expire in 2004 so I'm not sure of the effectiveness. I blame the seller completely and if the product had cost more than $5 I would have complained to Amazon and returned the product for a full refund. Avoid seller: Great Eastern pet supply.
5,Hello Anthony,"Anthony Newley was a very talented performer and composer. This album is a widely varied collection of pop, show tunes, folk tunes, and the immortal, ""Pop Goes the Weasel."" His vocal range was remarkable, from middle tenor to alto, more or less. My favorite example of his reading of a widely recorded song is, ""Bye Bye Blackbird."" He shows gentle humor and a touch of whimsey in his interpretation of ""Blackbird."" I thought about acquiring an album of his work for years, and I'm glad I finally said yes. Tony will be entertaining me and my wife for years to come."
4,Review of Applying COM+,"I like this book, it really gets down to the root level. The author's approach to the topic is very methodical, which is good.I think that this book is good for people who are advanced VB programmers, and any C++ programmers wanting to leverage COM+ in their applications. Anybody who is truly an advanced VB programmer should be able to read IDL and C++ code and see what is generally going on.I really liked the level of detail that the author went into about COM+, and I liked how the author got under the hood.I consider this book as a good COM+ reference book."
2,Applying Com+,"I bought this book relying on the good reviews you have on your website. I was dissapointed.The book lucks of thorough explanations of COM+, the sample codes can't be applyed to the real world. It seems like either the previous reviewers work for Mr.Brill or the reviews were written by his friends."
2,Don't waste your time,Don't waste your time reading this book. The author has little if no understanding of COM.The entire book leaves an impression that Mr.Brill heard something about COM but does not know what to do with it.
5,Complimentary Metals!,"I like the looks of both of these metal colors individually, and I like them even better together! It is simple in design, but rather elegant looking. The weighted bottom keeps it nicely in place when tearing off paper towels. I am very pleased with this product."
2,MIsleading...,"If only I'd listened to the song samples before picking this up!If I had done that, I would have realized that these are in fact, for the most part, INFERIOR LATER RE-RECORDINGS of the Vibrators tracks we know and love. Stay away from this. By all means, Pure Mania and a few others are essential, but this one should be avoided."
2,Boring British Punk,"Maggie Thatcher's election victory in 1979 meant that, for the first time since recovery from the Second World War, that the British were in trouble. These boring pre-Thatcher punk tracks by British trio The Vibrators were re-recorded in 1999 and collected here in this album, and they suck! A slapped-together mash of every bad pre-Maggie punk song the Vibrators ever made back in the '70s - these songs should have stayed there. Vocals sound more like rap than song, and they suck. That's probably the best way to describe this awful collection of the worst of British punk. This collection of bad British punk is not representative of true British punk.For first rate British punk, punk from British groups like Antisocial, Genocides, The Fits, Uncle Fester, and Tunnel Vision (to name a few), check out ""The Ugly Truth About Blackpool"", volume one, by JSNTGM Records. Their CD has 27 bands playing REAL BRITISH PUNK."
2,"OK , could be better",This gun is worthless unless you stretch the spring!Don't buy peice of junk laser bearly works scope is useless silencer makes the range even worse I just ripped of the scope and laser offDO NOT BUY!
1,really bad gun and price!!!!!!!!!!,"This gun is reallly the worst in evey aspect. It will break down after 3 weeks at most. i couldnt belive the bad quality. At first i thoght it was good since it was sort of heavy, but then i tried setting the bb for the next round and shoot it, but it didnt work. the bb also doesnt go that far probobl just 20-30 meters. Well anyway this is not a reccomended item for anyone even begginers. Very bad gun!!!!!"
2,Not for little boys!!!!,"After reading all of the reviews on several different training toilets, I decided to go with the one by Baby Bjorn. On the day it arrived, we were so excited to try out the new pottie. However, after three attempts and a whole lot of mess, my son and I decided this toilet trainer was not going to work.I am the mother of three sons and have used a different toilet trainer with all of them. This one was the worst!! The urine shield was not concave enough to protect from spill-overs with a little (2 1/2 year old) boy. From the photo of the product, I imagened that the urine shield was hollow on the backside; it was not. The backside of the shield is continued plastic striaght down with a slight inward contour.However, I think the product was easy to set-up, even for little ones to do themselves, and would be great for little girls."
3,"Great Potty Seat, but........",I have three different toilets in my house and the toilet trainer seat only fits on one. All of my toilets in my house are regular toilets and have regular standard toilet seats but it still only works on one. So be careful that if you buy this seat to make sure to go home and try the seat to see if it fits.Other then that it is a great seat.
3,Not as risk free as some suggest,"This seat fits nicely on to the toilet, but on the 3-4th time my son sat on it, when he stood up, he complained he hurt something. When I looked, he had a small scratch on his penis that had to have come from the little ""splash guard"" on the front. It didn't bleed for long, but still, it wasn't like he wriggled all over the place in order to get it. Fortunately, it hasn't deterred him from using it again, but ideally we'd all like toilet training to be a painless experience."
3,"Good product, too much [$]",I liked this because it fit on our toilet seat. I also liked the splash guard. It's easy to use and instal. The downside is that it costs more than a potty chair. If the cost could come down it would be the best investment.
3,spash guard not high enough,My toddler boy is 2 1/2 and even though I like the durability of this seat. . .the splash guard just isn't high enough. He ends up going all over the floor. I think my solution will be to have him pee on it backwards (which he'll eventually have to learn anyways). I also don't think this product is worth the money. I've seen similar products for under $10. Good luck to all you potty trainers out there!
3,Works great on some seats,"Works great on older toilets with flatter seats, with a knob that turns to secure it from wiggling around. However, it does NOT fit securely on newer toilets, such as Toto toilets, that have more molded seats."
4,For older trainers,"I wanted to train my child early (before 1 year old), and this seat must be for older trainers as it has excellent reviews. It IS comfortable, it DOES stay on the seat very well, but my daughter's legs stick straight out or hang down without touching the floor and she likes feeling secure. She's 1 1/2 years old now-maybe I will try it again, but the ""once upon a potty"" saddle seat that sits on the ground seemed to work better for her as she feels more in control. The other thing is with one that young, you need to sit right by the potty and ""sit"" them. My daughter likes some space and a couple of books, so being up high does not really work with that."
2,Uncomfortable,"This seat is easy to clean but my daughter found the splash guard high and hard to maneuver around. The splash guard comes over an inch up higher than the seat. It also doesn't have anything to give it traction on a bathroom floor so it slides around. It was succesful in encouraging her to use the big toilet she disliked it so much. Next time, for a girl I would purchase one with a more comfortable seat."
1,Beware of all these kinds of potty seats,"I say that because if your child becomes ""addicted"" to using it, be prepared to drag it with you everywhere, because they won't use a regular potty without it. I know of TOO MANY mothers this has happened to!"
3,DON'T BUY THIS FOR A BOY!!,"I bought this potty seat because of its easy-to-clean design. It looks like it would work great for a girl, but the built-in urine deflector is not high enough for a boy. Even after I taught my son to ""point it down,"" the urine went under the deflector and collected between the toilet seat and the potty seat, leaving a ring of urine on the toilet seat when an adult went to use the toilet. The seat itself is easy to clean with a disinfectant wipe."
3,Good but certainly not his best,"Archer is such a great writer, but I found this story just lacking a bit. Since his writing is so good, the book is still enjoyable...."
4,"Intense story line, gripping tale. No disappointments here!","""Honor Amoung Thieves"" is the second book by Mr. Archer that I have had the chance to read, the first being ""First Amoung Equals"". Politics seem more exciting than normal whenever I open a book by Mr. Archer. His characters are believable and his story line never lags. He is truly an amazing artist!"
3,Average Book,Honor Among Thieves goes up and down. It seemed to start pretty slow. Giving some background and other information. There were some interesting parts but I don't think it got good until the last few chapters. When the plot thickened. I have read better novels but Honor Amoung Thieves had a pretty good plot.
5,What a Twist,"I've read this book several times and will read it many more times. Even though I know the story, and the characters, I never cease to be amazed at the twists and turns this tale leads me on. A great read!!"
5,Diabolical,This book has more twists and turns than the tunnels of Maya. Fast paced reading which you can't put down. Archer is without doubt the best writer of the century. Two thumbs up for this masterpiece!
4,Flawed but stunning novel nonetheless.,"Archer spins a harrowing tale of suspense that is both preposterous and frightening at the same time. Another storyteller would botch the improbable plot Archer has chosen, but his meticulous detail, his pace, and his realistic spin on an insane situation add up for one of the more satisfying and enjoyable novels in recent memory. Character development is one crucial part of this memorable read, and all the players are developed brilliantly, from the lead participants to the men behind the scenes. The only flaw: a truly preposterous plot, combined with moments of sheer idiocy, combine to water down the suspense a little. However, the superb ending and quick pace make this an excellent suspense novel, written in fine Archer form"
3,"Flawed, but immense entertainment nevertheless.","This being Archer's first 'action thriller', I was skeptical when I picked up this book as I am used to reading his 'sagas'. However, I must say that all the doubts I had about the book were banished once I had read the first chapter. The book's villain is the inevitable Saddam Hussein, who, hiring an professional, plans to steal the American Declaration of Independence and burn it on international television, thus humilating the American people. The book's hero is the unlikely teacher at college, who teams up with a former agent of some sort who is bent on killing Saddam. Though not his most memorable or realistic novels, it still is a very entertaining ride. Perhaps if the plots had been made more plausible (eg.getting into the National Archives during a film shot), the book would make a more lasting impression on the minds of readers. However, despite the flawed storytelling, the book is one juicy slab of entertainment!"
2,"Lots of Killing, little content","This book is the worst Archer book I've ever read. Unlike his other novels, with relatively unpredictable endings, this one was obvious from the start. Archer tried to make an action book and failed. The author should stick with plots involving rivalries (see First Among Equals, The Fourth Estate) with fewer characters. With so many characters, none could be developed fully, and Archer only attempts to make two of them more than one-dimensional. Yes, there was action, and lots of death, but little substance. While this book won't prevent me from reading more Archer, it won't be a book I'll ever read again."
1,This book is a perfect example of word processed trash.,"Honour Amoung Thieves is such a poorly written piece of word processed trash I was driven to finish it with the same impetus that drives one to pick a painful scab or tounge a sore tooth. The plot is as ridiculous, contrived and full of holes as a 1930's movie serial yet completely lacking in charm, humour or grace. The characters are simple racial stereotypes strung together like cheap plastic beads on the frayed dental floss of the storyline. There are crafty, evil Arabs, an Irish drunk, gravel voiced Mafia dons, and resourceful, dedicated Israelis. The book is so poorly thought out it gives the impression of being poured out onto a computer screen with one take and barely enough time for a spell check. Archer must have had a past due child support payment and where was the editor"
5,In one word: awesome!!!,"Saddam Hussein plans to mastermind a robbery of the Decleration of Independence by hiring the mafia, world's best forgery expert and one of Clinton's close aides with $100 million. Then he plans to embarrass US by burning the national treasure in front of the world media. This book is absolutely awesome, the plots, twists and story-line move like a ferrari. Once you start reading it, you won't be able to put it down. Archer's best book to date."
4,"A very readable book, with a solid imaginative plot","I bought this book on a sale for about 12$(Hardcover) , and the suspense/price ratio is one of the highest to date for me personally.Sadam Hussein endeveaours to steal The Declaration of Independence, in order to humiliate The US by burning it on CNN live. The mission for the us-Isrealy intellegence community now is simple; GET IT BACK !.The book has manyfaceted characters, that are essential for et good plot. Very much worth its price"
1,very very disappointing,"This was my first Jeffrey Archer book, and I am not impressed at all. His style of writing is really uninteresting. The dialogue is really cheesy - there's nothing new or witty here. You don't feel for any of the characters since there is no character development . The plot is silly - I never got the point of stealing the Declaration of Independence. I mean Saddam's got better (or should I say worse) things to do. And there's no suspense at all - you know how the book's going to end from the start since this is intended for American readers.Overall, two words: boring and trite."
4,great,"I'm not a comic person, but this came reccomended so i thought...why not? I look forward to number two...think I'll search for it now."
3,The Maxx like New,i recieved The maxx #1 just when i was told i would. it is a great comic and i look forward to reading it
2,Rare story on men's feelings,"Is this film an ad for Kentucky Fried Chicken? The family visits KFC for dinners and meetings.The movie is unique in that it is an emotional story about four men from the same family, from four different generations-great grandpa, grandpa, pa, and his son. The entire family history comes out little by little. The troubles and troubled times are not avoided in conversations. After great grandpa's death, the grandpa, pa, and his son travel together to fulfill the wishes of great grandpa. This becomes an opportunity for them to get in touch with each other and the past. The pa and his son bond with the grandpa. Grandpa then disappears, which has been his pattern.Touching moments, old memories, hidden truths and facts, and pain and guilt abound. It is a strong, emotionally loaded, powerful story for the serious audience. Not exactly light entertainment.Good writing, direction and acting. Rare movie revealing the feelings of men, but only for selected audience."
2,"Confusing story line, but what I understood was okay","The problem here is the script, or perhaps the directing or the editing. Wherever the blame lies, the story of the movie just isn't clearly enough delineated to keep you involved the whole time. There are some touching scenes, some good acting, some moments that make you think and feel, but overall it just doesn't stack up. Too bad, too, because there's some good performances here. The only thing they did well is promote Kentucky Fried Chicken. Makes you wonder if the whole film was thought up by KFC advertising execs as a way to promote their restaurants...Guess that failed as hardly anybody's ever heard of this film."
2,Nothing Here But Walken!,"Christopher Walken is a pleasure to see in just about any movie he is in, and this one is no exception. As for the rest of the movie, there is nothing there.It tried very hard to be an uplifting story about the re-connection of four generations of a family, that was never a cogent, connected family to begin with. There are hints of mystery, without much of an explanation, and lots of secrets.But hard as it may have tried, it just didn't work. The movie sets a mood, a very depressing mood at that, and there is nothing else, aside from Walken."
3,Volver a Empezar,"I did enjoy this movie but not as much as Gabriel because there were no subtitles and I assumed, because of the video cover, that it was more Chayanne and the lead actress. That was not the case so I was a little disappointed. It was still good to see Chayanne in his early 20s and how he has grown in his acting career and he is so handsome so it was definitely eye candy. If you don't speak or read Spanish it was hard but the story was pretty easy to follow.Overall a good video."
2,Yes - very sticky on dental work.,"Like at least one of the other reviewers, I also had severe problems with the gum sticking to my dental work. I found this gum to be impossible to chew because I have ONE crown on a molar. The entire piece of gum stayed solidly stuck to the crown the whole time I was trying to chew it, forming a gum-coating on that one tooth. I am sure that I can find someone to take this pack off my hands, but unfortunately, this one piece has been enough for me. Other than that one issue, the gum seemed good and I think it would have been ok if I didnt have a crown. :("
1,Glee gum sticks to teeth,I was lucky not to actually buy this gum - but I was given a pack about an hour ago - tried the gum and have to say it sticks to my teeth!! Just thought I'd share with anyone interested in buying...
3,Handy tray for long trip when you have kids,Instead of spending ~5K for built in DVD player I went for portable DVD players for my kids. The tray came in very handy not just for DVD player but also for the kids to have snacks. The cup holder also came in very handy. Rated a little low for its price. But it paid for itself on our 1200 miles each way drive to Orlando.
2,too small for my 13'' ASUS laptop,"no manual came along with the product, only package has some pictures. very difficult to use. Still haven't figure out how to use it on the steering wheels, because even after fasten the screws, the desk is still moving. Even if I could use it, the size of the desk is too small for my 13"" laptop."
3,"Best tray for auto I found, but still looking for something larger&sturdier","What I was looking for when I purchased this item, and still am looking for, is essentially an airplane style seat tray. This tray wished it could be that sturdy and sizable. Let me tell you what this tray will do. It will stay affixed to the seat in front of it and will hold a few light items, such as a juice box and bowl of finger snacks. It is also sturdy enough to hold a small portable video player, having the screen size one finds factory installed in minivans. It is too small for a laptop, which is what I purchased it for. It is not large or sturdy enough to use as a table for coloring pictures. Even with these drawbacks, it may still work for you. Measure out the tray size to see if it's large enough for you and recognize that some of the clearance over the tray will be obstructed by the angle of recline of the front seat. Good luck."
4,"Smaller than Expected, but Will Work","I ordered this tray for my eight year old niece to draw on while we take a 16 hour car ride, in addition to watching movies on with a portable DVD. This tray will work great for the purpose intended.The tray is smaller than I expected, if someone would ever put a laptop on it the laptop better be a super small 9"" screen or an iPad because my standard size laptop with about a 16"" screen would never fit on it and I think would be too heavy. Depending on how much I liked the tray I was going to get a second one for my fifteen year old nephew, but I believe it's too small for him to use.From reading other's reviews if you have a child in a car seat that would kick it, yes, this tray would not work, but I don't think you'd ever find a tray that would for a child that age. The pieces that tighten it are plastic, but they do work, I haven't had any problem with them falling out of the tray not staying up. I hope this helps anyone debating on purchasing this item."
1,Worst Tray Ever,"I bought this for my daughter to use in the backseat. Its the worst product ever. The tray is very flimsy and doesnt fold down very easy, I have to fight with it everytime to get it flat. Also, the screws for tightening the tray are constantly falling out. It was the bigest waste of my money."
3,"great, but broke","This worked great for writing on while someone else was driving. Adjusts to different seat angles. Love it, but it broke after about 2 weeks. It is very inexpensive, mayble I will just order another one. KT"
1,Not worth a damn,"I bought this after seeing the advertisement with a full sized laptop sitting on the table. I have a little 10"" netbook and it couldn't even hold its weight without collapsing - I cranked the plastic hold down screws as much as possible but it still slipped. This table is rickety and thin, and the cupholder is cut too small at the bottom - worthless as well. Overall completely useless item - I was going to send back, and they were nice enough to send me an RA #, BUTI have to pay shipping? Much cheaper to throw it in the trash. WORTHLESS."
3,Not very impressed....,"smaller than I expected, average drink does not fit in in cup holder. Is good for allowing for more space to hold your quick drive thrus. Have not tried to use a lap top. I plan to keep it however... I don't feel its worth what I paid."
2,"good idea, not very well made","The first time this was taken out of the package to use at a ball game, the hooks weren't connected and there were no bolts or screws in the package. Too bad, this would have been perfect for our seats."
2,Dont waste your money,This is not a good product at all. It made from poor plastic and does not stay in position. Get something better.
2,Great in theory,"We got this tray for our 10-month-old daughter to watch Baby Einstein on a five-hour car trip ... it did not work for us because it would not fit behind the seat without her being able to kick it from her car seat. We will try to use it again when she is older -- although I imagine that she would have to be MUCH older since I'm not sure she'd be able to get close enough to it when she's using a child booster seat that's required by law in our state. But for our immediate needs, it didn't work."
1,Broken product,This watch does not work. I am extremely disappointed that I paid that much money and the watch doesn't even work.
4,Great Toy [should be bought,"This toy is really fun.It could keep you entertained for hours.I like this toy because all the detials it gives.Legolas is very easy to stand but the daggers are very easy to break.Gimli has great detailes on his axes but there is also something bad about him, at the end of his head he has a pony tail that is a problem because it might fall off.Araagorn has really no down side so that makes him a really good character."
4,Excellent way to teach a small child lots of stuff in fun,"Excellent way to teach your small child lots of stuff in a fun way. The best material I have found for teaching your very young child. A great way to discover early what kinds of things interest your youngster and get to know him (make many ""flashcards"" on many different subjects). Some of the introductory chapters I found a bit boring especially since his other books start virtually the same way and I had read a couple of the others already. Overall: I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves their child and wants to get to know him and give him a great start in life (ultimately finding a career and/or hobby that he loves and the happiness of doing it well by starting to explore interests early."
4,"Fairbairn, the man from the famous commando dagger!","A clear and plain book! little time is wasted on philosophic mumbo jumbo. A quick book to learn from. The techniques are very easy and effective and thus very useful for everybody; so I would surely recommend it for beginners; for advanced students: this book gives you an extra edge, no NEW techniques but that does not matter with this book. If you want to learn self defense from a book, this book is gonna help you. keep in mind that the use of some techniques could bring you to jail but can also save your life. The unarmed section is also suitable to set up self defense courses, it does not cover every situation, but it is a firm base to start from! There are no flashy jump kicks here and no flowery techniques. Not a book for sissies!"
2,No much here.,"It's really dated. There's a picture, and then a step by step explanation of the move. It was really short, and really basic. If it was cheaper I'd have no problem, but this was definitely not worth $10. $5, sure."
3,Interesting as historic material...,"Very interesting as example how the manuals were issued during WWII. The techniques exposed there has a lot Ju Jutsu influence (just it was the martial art's fashion of the period), but only some of them are really effective. By the way, useful to compare with more recent training manual and appreciate the evolution of the hand to hand combat training."
2,balls to the wall,"The book 'get tough' truly has balls to the walls techniques - direct and brutal. However, readers should note that this is not the complete hand to hand combat manual that this gentleman published. Some techniques and procedures are actually missing from this ""compilation.""Secondly, although the techniques are direct and brutal they are limited only to techniques that are executed (1) with combat uniforms (fatigues, boots etc.), (2) standing upright and (3) against one opponent always. In the today's world these techniques may have their shortfalls.The book is good for reference purpose (history maybe) and is not the be all and end all of hand to hand fighting."
5,Get tough,"Good book. Old school WWI techniques, but very nice and new techniques to me, even as a martial artist of many years. Recommend it! A coulple of the techniques are a little tricky to visualize what they are doing in the pictures but the majority are clearly stated."
3,pretty cool,I dont really know what to say. This is a cool old book with practical ways to defend yourself. I like it because it's realistic and teaches you how to win and damage the enemy as much as possible.
5,Most are Awesome.,"I got this book 3 years ago, and every now and then I still go back to read it again. Some of the stories in here I could read forever, and apparently one author, Joanne Bertin, just came out with her first novel, based on the world in this book. Her story, ""Dragonlord's Justice,"" is my favorite in this book, and can't wait to read her novel."
5,BEST SOUL ALBUM YOU NEVER HEARD,"there's so much i want to say. first , this album is amazing, will have you singing and laughing and weeping all at the same time. really. its a crime its never heard, there are so many awesome artists who are on it. my favorite is micheal mcdonald ,thats right,the lead singer for the dooby brothers and an awsome piano player contributes to several songs.really for the price its a shame you don't have a copy in your music library."
5,"Very useful, efficient exercise!","Yes, we all know that the fashions are a little dated, and the instructor walks a fine line between being encouraging and a little annoying (""Hey gang""!). However, this remains one of my favorite and most-used exercise DVDs. The exercises are simple and efficient, and the instruction is clear and concise. Put the DVD in, start the program, and before you know it you are done. This and ""Perfect-in-Ten Abs"" are in constant rotation for the days that I cannot make it to the gym."
4,For super busy and super workouts,"I have a hectic life because of my children, my work, etc. This DVD, 8 minute workouts, has been a superb! You can choose which part of your body that you need to change.Although sometimes I think that 8 minutes won't do anything, but the result is coming slowly. Healthier and fitter!"
4,M.D.,Really great results. The work-outs get to the point. You feel the burn and know that you are doing the exercises properly. Very happy with the DVDs.
4,Not bad!,"It's a little cheesy but it's still not bad. I love the arms, buns and legs workout but can't bear the abs workout b/c my back hurts from doing sit ups. I was hoping that they had an innovative way of working abs but it was good ole situps, eek. Overall, i'm happy with the product. i like that they have the timer and the instructor is great. If you want to work abs without doing sit ups, try taebo kicks!"
3,If you could see the 8 Minute Workouts...,"This DVD is not good quality, but the workout is good. For 8 minutes, I definitely felt it the next day. The price is right for what you get."
1,Not good for advanced exerciers,"I got this set because of the great reviews, but the Abs and Arms DVD is not a challenge at all for intermediate or advanced exercisers. I did it twice a day and felt NOTHING. The Buns DVD works ok, but it is essentially the same exercises as the Legs. Overall, probably good for beginners, but intermediate or advanced exercisers would do better off with the Firm Parts or the Abs Diet DVD."
2,Not for the relatively fit,"I am a relatively fit person, who wanted a quick daily ab work out to get ready for the summer months. After reading the reviews, this DVD sounded ideal. Afterall, I definitely have 8 minutes every day. However, I do not find the work out challanging. Even after three days of continual use, my abs are not sore. I am disappointed and will probably have to invest in another DVD that is more challanging. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
1,"terrible old styles, poor production, NOT WORTH IT","this is such a joke, the video is poorly produced and the set is so 80'ish that I was joking and then crying I wasted my money on it. The wardrobes are pitiful, and the instruction is not very good. It is set up for beginners, but fit people won't get much out of it. This video is sooooooooo over-rated, don't wast your time or money."
2,Don't waste your money....,They spent about 8 minutes and 8 bucks putting together this cheesy video. Production is not as good as some school video projects. There are two very bored people in the back who look like they don't want to be there. The 'person' in the front is a pretty boy in shorts made of tights material. ...I gave it a whooping 2 stars... If you could tolerate watching it you will get a good workout.
5,Really works!,"I only had this DVD for a couple of days, but I love it! I really feel it in my abs already. I also love it because it doesn't take up a lot of my time. I can seem to find 8 minutes to exercise!"
5,Wonderful for folks with back issues,"I have serious lower back issues. These exercises are not only effective, but the only ones of their kind I can do without hurting my back. I love them!"
4,A pretty good buy for the money,"I bought this DVD just for the Abs workout, which has turned out to be pretty successful. After just three weeks, there's a definite change in definition and my pants seem to be fitting better too! The two problem that I have are that two or three of the exercises hurt my neck(despite my attempts to do them correctly). Instead of doing those, I just insert other ab exercises which seems to work well. The other issue is that the guy is annoying, but I just mute it! Worth the money if you're looking for an easy at home work out."
4,"No excuse, it's only 8 mins!",I bought this not expecting anything amazing and when it comes down to it these dvd's really work. This set is a great value and has a ton of great extras. There is no way you have an excuse that you can't find 8 mins free in your day. You will have to get used to the cheesy host and a lot of odd spandex!
3,Second Time Around,"I love this! Admittedly, I haven't tried the buns and legs section, but a friend and I did the abs and arms almost everyday for nine months until the tape finally gave out and broke. Now, we're getting a new one. This is definitely a great, easy, and fast workout.When we got to the point that we could quote everything the lead instructer said, we starting turning the sound all the way down and turning on music.Whatever your method of doing these workouts, give it a try. Everyone has eight minutes in their day, if not sixteen, or more."
4,Big help for those with little time,"I have four young kids and a travelling husband, and we homeschool. A gym membership is just not practical right now, but I am a person who likes to stay active (and somewhat fit). This set of DVD's is totally 80's but also effective, so that's why I recommend it. Switch it up a little with some other videos for variety, but dedicate just a handful of minutes every day to moving your body and you'll see results."
5,Love the Grunts!,"Great CD, Love the grunts especially on ""Follow in the Cry"", which is a fantastic song. Floor's vocals are great too. Seems like not a lot of folks like the grunts, but I consider them an essential part of the overall ""sound"". Check out ""Decipher"" from the same band, which is great also. Enjoy!"
3,Nice CD until the cookie monster interrupts...,"I just recently started listening to After Forever and I just can't understand this cookie monster crap in the songs! Floor Jansen has a beautiful voice, the music is pretty darn good...then the cookie monster destroys the mood! I know some people like growling; but I think it undermines the music, especially Floor's vocals. The last song on the cd 'Beyond Me' has Sharon den Adel as a guest singer. Both women sing beautifully, the song is wonderful, then HE shows up! You could edit 2 mintues out of the song to get rid of the growling and the song would be almost perfect. I would really like to see the band drop the growling and let Floor's voice soar."
3,Lots of pictures but not a lot of substance,"This book has an amazing number of never before seen photographs of the R101 and her crew. It had way it is quite amazing. It said it was a pictorial history and it lives up to the pictorial side but what is disappointing is that it makes a lot of claims, that the R101 wasn't so bad (when we know she was), that the new fangled innovations were actually great (when we know they were not) but does not back them up. Instead they are just a lot of assertions. On that score I was disappointed."
5,"Cool Toy, Reminds Me Of Another Thing",In General Grevious' bike mode that reminded me of one of the D'Wheels used in the new Yu-Gi-Oh 5'Ds series. It's the one used by the bad guy. General Grevious is my friends favorite Sith and I will get it to show to him. I don't like it that he only comes with 2 lightsabers when he usually has 4 (2 green and 2 blue that he took after killing 4 Jedi). The legs are exposed when in packaging. Someone comment this review and tell me if it's supossed to look like that. So that's it I gotta run.
2,Good price - poor printing,"This is a full size Bible at a great price. However, the paper is thick and off-white and the printing is of poor quality and hard to read. Not a great Bible for steady use."
2,Poor quality bags,"The flavor of the Cylon Tea was good but the quality of the bags holding the tea grounds was very poor. Almost every bag comes apart while the tea is steeping and the grounds come out into the cup of tea, even if I did not touch the bag or dip the tea bag up and down. It was very annoying. I would not buy this tea again."
1,Can you say boring?,"I love the Dear America books, but this one was very boring and lifeless. The girl thought she could here her father talking to her. Which was weird, because he was dead. If you are going to read a book in this series, dont make it this one."
1,Poorly written fiction misrepresented as a diary,"I picked up this book believing it be a diary, or at least based on a diary, of a young woman in Nebraska in the 1880's - which is what the cover proclaims it to be. It is in fact poorly written fiction. Neither the style of writing nor the actions and thoughts of the main character, or the other characters, are remotely authentic. There are a few historical details thrown in which give it an air of historical authenticity - enough to make a child believe it was an accurate account, but ascribing 21st century motivations and attitudes to a 19th century character."
2,I Tried . . . I Really Did!,"I was about half-way through this book when I finally had to face the fact that I was not at all interested. I was just forcing myself to read because I had to know what happened to Sarah, the orphaned girl without family to turn to; but the writing styel was dry and tasteless. Sarah had no personality, and neither did any of the people in the wind beaten Prarie town where she lived. And Sarah says things that don't make any sense. There is a girl who wants to be her friend, but Sarah says that she talks to much. But she WAS NOT too talkative! All she did was make ordinary conversation! A strange and annoying read."
3,It kept my interest somewhat.,"This book could have had more drama and more excitement. After all Sarah had just lost her father, and her world had been turned upside down. If anyone else was living in the middle of the prairie in the 1800's, everything would have been traumatic. Two other books I recently read which I prefer was THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO and THE JOURNAL OF LEROY JEREMIAH JONES."
4,Pure russian developer,"I'm a pure russian developer, that want to do the File System universal reader. And i want to have electronical version of this book. Please, send me one."
5,"Very, very happy!","I was very, very happy with this purchase. I received the book quickly and it was in the condition stated. I would definitely buy from this seller again:) Nicolette"
2,"Unlikable people, unrealistic plot!","I like Nancy Thayer's books, and was glad to find one at the library that I'd never read. Unfortunately, this one wasn't worth the effort. I found Kate, Max, Lucy and Chip to be thoroughly unlikable, self-absorbed, immature people. Maybe I'm naive, but I'd like to think that the majority of us married people out there don't have continual fantasies about members of the opposite sex! Lucy and Kate leave their two small children with a babysitter so that they can go bar hopping and dance with grungy strange men. They both get drunk, Kate goes off with the stranger she picks up and sleeps with him, and Lucy drives home drunk and makes the babysitter walk home. What am I missing!!! I don't know anybody who acts this way! It's hard to like a book when you find all of the characters so thoroughly reprehensible. They should find a nice foster home for Jeremy and Margaret."
4,Keeps You Wondering...,"I couldn't put it down! Everytime I finished a chapter, I wanted to keep going. A good book to curl up on the beach with.Couldn't believe how it ended, it was a definite suprise and a definite must read."
1,Do not download the MP3 versions of this CD!,"I just purchased the MP3 versions of these tracks and the the music sounds distorted. Looks like someone didn't set the levels correctly when converting to MP3. Couldn't even ask for a refund do to the problem because find a page on Amazon where you can tell them your problem. Try shopping on itunes, at least you can actually reach someone who will help you."
2,Diappointing,"I ordered this for my daughter to wear to a school sock hop. She is 6 1/2 and wears all size 7 clothes. It was WAY to small. Would never have fit her appropriately. We let her younger, 3 year old sister wear it instead. She loves it, but for the price, I think it is very poorly made. The ""belt"" around the middle is made of plastic about as thick as a plastic garbage sack, and consequently gets pulled and stretched out easily, so it doesn't look good at all. Very disappointing."
2,Pitching Aid,"This is a good concept product and I would recommend it for all young pitching candidates. The problem with this particular product is that there is no way to change the size, so it had better fit the person you are buying it for. The 14 yr old, 5'3"", 120lb girl That I got it for had no way to get this around her thigh. We had to cut the elastic and add some velcro. Now I can use it for all my pitchers-big and small. Any good taylor shop can make one of these in minutesand cheaply."
2,Markwort Perfect Circle Pitcher's Training Aid,"I wish I had read the reviews. Got this for my 11 year old who is very slim and it is way to small. I called Markwort and though they were nice enough they insisted they had been selling it for years and it should work and that I was using it wrong. Don't know how you could could use something so simple incorrectly. Anyway, will have to modify it to work. Should have just bought some velcro and made one myself if I am going to have to modify this one."
3,pitching aide,Was too small for my 9 yr old granddaughter. Would have been better if the band were larger and maybe more velcro.
5,My Pug Bible,"Shirley Thomas brought my beloved pug, Charlie (1992-2008), into my life and I'm still in touch with her. She knows more about pugs than anyone on earth! I still have this book, purchased in 1992. Highly recommended!"
1,I love Pugs,"I have this book and it is not what I was expecting.This is primarily for professionals, it is an old book and gives too much background for me."
3,"Decent book, but some errors","This book is an easy read, and informative, though not nearly as detailed as some other books on Washington's wines which are available for comparable prices.I was bothered by the erroneous maps printed in the sections describing each of Washington's A.V.A.'s. These maps showed the Yakima River flowing south and east of the city of Yakima. In actuality, the river does go through Yakima, and extends north beyond Ellensburg.I wonder how much the authors really know about Washington wines, and how much care they put into their research, if this type of error slipped by them."
2,"pretty pictures, lifestyle how-to manual","What a very odd combination of entries for a book: tips for raising children, running a home, decorating...it's like a how-to manual for English yuppies. There are beautiful photographs and ideas of things--chair pads, curtains--and how to duplicate them, all in styles and colors that will soon be dated, but for now are very pretty. For all the non-English: garden = yard."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,This is the best wrist brace I have found. I only wish I could find it in a size small for the left hand!
1,rocks Rivers The changing earth,I would have to say that this is a good book because of its showing of pictures. Which also made it a fun okay book. the book has very good hand drawn pictures. If you want to learn about the earth this is a perfect book for you. One thing I didnt like is the confusing words that it used. If its going to be in a 7th grade library 7th graders should be able to understand most of the words.Overall it was an okay book but not that good. Unless you like educational books.
3,A Great New Guidebook,"Just finished this guide after moving to Nicaragua. It really was a huge help when I was exploring the country. I recommend this guide along with ""Living and Investing in the New Nicaragua"" and ""Footprints"" for anyone thinking of wintering or living full-time in the country. Don't leave home without them."
3,"A good, average guide.","Honestly, I only purchased this book because of the lack of options in Nicaragua travel guides. I normaly purchase the DK eyewitness series, or AAA spiral guides, because of their pictures and maps. But, after spending a month in Nicaragua in Jan 06, I definately recommend this book. Alot of the prices are out of date, especially in regards to the hotels and stuff... but the places and locations never change, and the guide is, for the most part, right on."
5,Finally a good Nicaragua guidebook,"While planning a trip to Nicaragua 4 years ago, I realized that there was not a decent book to assist in preparing for such an awesome journey. Berman and Wood have filled that void. In their Moon Handbook - Nicaragua, the authors go beyond sharing all the useful information for getting around. This book also includes great photos and a very insightful review of activities including nightlife. The sections on history, politics, and culture provide a necessary context to a trip to this part of the world. Lastly, this book eliminates many of the myths of Nicaragua that intimidate travelers in an objective and informative manner. Congratulations Moon."
3,Helpful for the first-time traveller,I found this guide helpful on my first trip to the country. It is full of valuable info. Obviously a lot of research went into this guide. I do think some of the filler material could be eliminated to improve the quality of the book.
1,Fun While it lasted,It was fun for the first throw. The material is flimsy and immediately broke. I wouldn't buy it again.
3,It was fun but not.,"This toy was very fun. Right when i got it i ripped the bag open and started playing with it immediatly. I played with it inside for about an hour then decided to go ouside, bad idea. I was having a blast until it started to just drop down after i throw it. Because of the winds there was a hole in it and could not play with it again. I almost cried because I will no longer be able to play with such a fun toy."
4,Save Your Money,My son got this toy for his 6th birthday and within ten minutes of tossing it around the yard it had a huge hole in it. Save your money--buy a frisbee.
1,"Fun, if I had received it!!!","I have had Hover Discs in the past and really enjoyed them with my grandchildren.Unfortuneately, I never received this one, although I paid for it!The post office supossedly delivered it, but where??I was looking forward to having it when my grandkids visited.Very disappointing."
3,"Fair, It is basically a mylar balloon. Not very sturdy.","The children had a great time w/ this toy. Luckily, I purchased more than one as the first one was destroyed withing 24 hrs. This was purchased as a birthday present for a seven year old boy. The item hovers best when filled with helium. However, not everyone in our area would fill an item that was not purchased at their establishment. We found a party supply shop that charged $4.00 for a fill. You will have to refill it as it does lose air over time."
2,Lasted about an hour,"Lasted about an hour of normal play. While it was alive, kids had a ball, er. disk, with it. If only it was made out of one of those high-tech materials from NASA that they use to survive re-entry. Now, that would be a good toy."
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!!,I AM SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS TOY. AFTER THE FIRST DAY IT WAS COMING APART FROM THE PLASTIC RING. THEN AFTER I TAPED IT ALL UP WE GOT ONE MORE DAYS PLAY OUT OF IT BEFORE IT GOT A RIP. MY KIDS ARE SO DISAPPOINTED. I FEEL LIKE I JUST WASTED MONEY FOR ONE DAYS WORTH OF FUN. I WONT' BE BUYING ONE OF THESE THINGS AGAIN!
1,Don't waste your time,"My daughter begged for this toy for weeks after seeing it on tv and by chance we found one in Learning Express. We couldn't wait to get home and inflate it. We didn't have helium, so we blew into it with the straw. It was just ok when we took it outside, but she didn't like it cause it didn't look like the one on tv. So of course the next day I filled it with helium to make it fly like the tv...Big mistake, I over inflated it too. The plastic circle inside bent and wouldn't straighten even after we deflated it some. Then voila, my son poked it with his remote control car antenna and put a hole in it. I duck taped the hole to keep it goin longer, but then the circle inside broke in half and we couldn't use it at all any more. This toy is not durable in the least, just picture a regular old helium balloon with a plastic cirle inside. I thought it was junk and wish we got something else instead. Save your money"
3,TOO BIG!,"This hoverdisc is simply a baloon with a plastic ring in it. It is very fun to use but it came with a hole in it and its too big to play with indoors; i've never used it outdoors. When I used it indoors it crashed into everything. I think its only good if you have a very large house/yard, be extremely careful with it and check to make sure there are no holes in it before you buy it."
1,Stinks!,"My girls, 8 & 10 years old, love this until it got 2 rips in it in just a few hours. At the time I didn't have enough packing tape to repair it. Very disappointed!"
2,Torn within 5 minutes,"My daughter bought this with her own money. We brought it home, filled it up and it was torn within the first 2 tosses. It tore just a little at the edge, but it was just enough to let the air leak out. I contacted the company and got no response. She loved it and was upset when it ripped. Don't waste your money."
2,Don't Buy It,"Fun while it lasted, all of 10 minutes. Overpriced and flimsy.The product tears easily and isn't easily repaired. (...)"
5,blew away,I took it outside and it blew away in 2 throws. It went up and never came down. My dad doesn't want ot pay for another one.
2,Fun but not to cool,The hover disc is fun but it is dangerous. I had one and it hit the power line and there where sparks and our power went out.SAVE YOUR LIFE AND SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!
2,From the Childs Eye,My Daddy bought my brother andI this toy while he was out of town. I am sorry to say that itis not in my household any longer! It blew away in the wind.We bought others similar to this toy and they deflated quickly!Several holes developed in them. Don't but it!
3,Waste of money~!!!,"I bought 5 of these and my grandchildren 6 - 11 were warned to play very carefully with them. They did, but none of these lasted more than a week. That's a very expensive lesson to me~! Toys of this material should have a caution in large letters that they WILL break with not much effort~!"
4,Cats LOVE this toy!,"My daughter played with it for a couple weeks before it developed leaks/tears. She loved it and I thought it well worth the $12 price tag. I left it on the living room floor to see what my cats would do - cats love the mylar *crinkle*. Well the older cat gets under it and walks it around the room and the kitten attacks her or gets under it with her. They've been doing this game for over a month now (and the rips are getting big), but they looooove it. When they're tired, they flop down and sleep on it. I wonder if the PANIC mouse folks could incorporate this mylar disk into their toy... I know it's fragile (for holding air), but cats love the crinkle noise."
4,What do people expect?,"After reading the reviews you would have thought people spent $50 bucks on this toy. It is now clearanced to 6.99. Many people said they only had a couple days of use out of it before it broke. Well, I'd gladly pay 6.99 to entertain my three kids for two days. It sure beats the $100 bucks it would take for the same enjoyment for two hours at Chuck E. Cheeses. People don't seem to mind ""waisting"" their money on something like that which entertains for a couple hours, but they expected a mylar baloon to last a lifetime. If you go to a party shop and purchase a huge mylar balloon it'll cost you about $5 or more and deflates in a day or so...plus you can't use it like a frisbee either. I agree that the 12.99 price may have been a bit steep for the glorified balloon, but 6.99 is worth a days fun in my book."
3,Not the best....,"This series-compilation fills in a few of the gaps in the World at War series, but is no World at War which is arguably the best commercial review of WWII.Part of the reason the World at War is so compelling is it's historical footage and accuracy which is UNTAINTED by modernist views.The BBC history of WWII has a perceivable anti-war slant which doesn't belong in a historical accounting. the World at War is NOT pro-war mind you but simply relates what happened during the War.If you want a good, comprehensive, accurate accounting of WWII from both the Allies side and the Axis side (and civilian side as well) run, don't walk, and purchase World at War.if your simply looking for more information to fill out your library, you could do worse than this compilation, but you certainly could do better as well."
1,annoying anti-American viewpoints,"The sections on ""Battlefields"" contain annnoying anti-American propaganda aimed at General Mark Clark, Fifth Army Commander in Italy, and General John Lucas, commander of the Anzio beachhead. Professor Holmes, who never saw a battlefield except from a safe distance, does NOT interview anyone to defend the actions of either General Clark or General John Lucas.In the chapter on ""Bomber"", Professor Holmes presents only the story of British aircraft bombing Germany and completely excludes any mention of the US Air Force. In the chapter on ""Alamein"", there is no mention of the 400 tanks President Roosevelt and General Marshall sent the British Army. After listening to Holmes, you would think the British won WWII by themselves."
4,All right minus one thing,"It was on time, but it might have been handled wrong because part of the plastic that holds in the DVDs broke and cracked. The DVDs weren't harmed luckily."
3,World War 2 redux,"The first two discs showing the rise of national socialism are excellent,with much of it archival footage and well presented.Unfortunately,most of the rest contains simulated action,voice overs,interviews with survivors, somber music, pan and scan shots of battlefields,concentration camps,etc(as they look today)If you want the real footage and a great narration (Olivier),The World At War is the much better set.The dvds here are of good quality but each title is a seperate documentary in itself and in total has no cohesion to the massive subject.The rating rests primarily with the first 2 discs, which are superb.An overall expensive disappointment,imo."
2,Ugh!,"I will be honest, I bought this book because of the cover, that and because I'm a scatter brain who reads in almost every genre.This book might have been better except one thing; I am so NOT turned on by a girl getting her head stuffed into a soiled toilet bowl full of urine and toilet paper and the likes. If she would have left that out the book might have received more stars, or if she wouldn't have used that device so many times. I think a more appropriate title would have been Nights in The Loo.The interactions between the characters is decent though and the storyline are alright, I just feel it fair to warn people what they are getting into."
3,Tarkan - Bounce (Maxi-Single),1. Bounce (Original Version) 3:44- very good 8/102. Bounce (Don Candiani Reggaeton Remix) 3:18- excellent 10/103. Bounce (DJ Altay Indu Remix) 3:31- good 6/104. Bounce (Pacifique De Replay Remix) 3:08- good 5/105. Bounce (DJ Altay Oriental Mix) 3:44- good 6/106. Bounce (Armand Van Helden Mix) 6:51- bad 1/10
1,Save your money,"This is another one of those rip-offs. Sounds great, but doesn't do a darn thing. Don't waste your money. Wish I hadn't."
2,Not very effective,Didn't really work like other products I've used. I ran out of my regular spray and thought I'd try this and it had little to no effect on my dog. I'm definitely going back to the previous product.
4,Good product,The product came in three-four days. In perfect condition. Works great on hot spots on dogs.
1,Significant Distortions,The mirror reflects with significant distortions and it is very annoying. There a waviness to the reflection and the objects seem significantly further away than they actually are.
5,Fernandito Villalona: Bolerisimo,"Actually, it is a gift for a special person, and we both love it. It is exactly what I expect to receive, even if it not an image available when I purchase. Thanks!"
1,"Typical ""rich is evil"" stereotype.","This book promotes the stereotype that the being rich automatically makes you evil. The main character Chin Yu Min, is the wife of a wealthy man, who believes she is better than everyone else in her village (as all rich people do). And like all evil rich people, Chin needs to be taught a lesson on the real value of friendship and humility.Not for parents who want to teach their children that achieving a high level of financial success is not a bad thing."
2,Very sluggish on older systems,"While Norton is great protection, this recent edition slowed my computer horribly. Finally I reinstalled with ONLY the anti-virus component and it is back to decent speed. If you are running XP on an older machine, get only Norton Antivirus, System Works is a waste of money."
5,Very good product,I have used Norton for years. I am very pleased with the product and feel that it does a very good job of protecting my computer.
1,Nightmare to uninstall,Poorly designed and created more problems than it solved such as internal computer errors. I could not install any other software nor could I uninstall Norton 2007 Systemworks. Stay away from this antivirus software . There is better antivirus software available. I will never buy Norton again.
1,warning - will crash your system,"If you have an older systemworks loaded, NSW will go to remove the older GO BACK version. If it does, (depending on your system) OK. However, if it wants you to go to Symantek web site and download a GO BACK removal toll, beware. I downloaded it and ran it and it stated it wanted to restart my system. What it did was screw up the partition and crashed the system. GO Back puts your data in a seperate partition. Symantek knows about this and has a ""fix"" you run before loading NSW, but they didn't let anyone know that it may crash your system. On an older PC, without windows restore tool, it works OK. However, if you have a newer PC with a windows resotre loaded and then have an older NSW GO back loaded, it will crash your PC if you use their GO Back removal tool. Emailed Symantec twice, they stated they would get back in 7 days - never did. Hope you have better luck"
2,Nothing like it used to be ....,"I have used System Works on my computer since 2000. The 2007 version is nowhere as good as the older ones. They have deleted many of the ""real"" diagnostic features (Registry Optomizer), dummed down the rest, and added (rather forced) an auto-load Norton Protection Center that takes over the Windows Security Center and cannot be easily unloaded. Software should be made to be user-friendly ... this version is nothing like the previous ones!"
2,Not as good as before,"The new Systemworks has a horrible interface. You can't see what your options are easily. You can't see the status of your components. You can't see what version you have. When you load it after loading Norton Personal Firewall 2006, the Firewall will not load program rules (you have to uninstall the Firewall and then reinstall it). I'm not sure how the protection works, but the software ""redesign"" was done by an ergonomic moron."
1,NOT FOR VISTA!!,"Having used SystemWorks for years with XP, I was quite surprised to find that the 2007 version will not work with Vista- even though one of the advertisers on Amazon claimed compatibility!"
4,good if you like a challenge,"I cant beleive this game got bad reviews, if you want a racing game where the cars actually take skill to drive this is definitley it. Lots of courses and cars, loads of fun."
2,Dead on Arrival,"Both the initially delivered item and the replacement had little to no battery life left in them when they arrived. The original ball for the StarChaser lasted a very long time and would light up very brightly when the cats got it going fast enough. The first replacement received barely lit up at all, the second replacement seemed okay at first and then died within a week."
5,Work great as a replacement,I have two turbo scratchers and my cats love to take out the ball that they came with and lose them. I looked for replacement balls but could only find these that light up. I wasn't wanting the light up balls since my cats play with it at night and I thought it might be distracting. The cats seem to love them and haven't taken them out of the turbo scratchers but they still like to remove the original balls. They are lighter than the original ball but that doesn't take away from the cats playing with them.
4,"My cats love the StarChaser, after awhile gets harder to activate the lights","I got this to pair with theBergan Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy, Colors May Vary. It was cheaper than buying the one that already has the lighted ball (Bergan 70130 Star Chaser Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy and Scratch Pad - Pink). My two younger cats love it."
3,Bergan StarChaser Replacement Ball,"This product was delivered in a timely manner, however one of the two replacement lighted balls does not work very good. At first it didn't work at all, then it worked ok for a while. Now it's not near as bright as the other one. I was disappointed in this purchase."
3,My cat was just as happy with the regular ball.,"I had purchased the regular Bergan Chaser earlier, and decided to buy this ball as a replacement for the regular white ball that came with that product. My cat intermittently played with the chaser before I bought this ball, and I can't say this ball makes any difference. He plays with it about the same as he did before, with the regular ball. I wouldn't necessarily recommend, but I'm sure it makes some cats are more interested than others."
2,Bergan StarChaser Replacement Ball,It was Great while it lasted...which was about a week. After that it would not light. Our cats Loved it and played with the lighted ball after Lights-out. I wish there was a ball that could be recharged by light everyday and glow at night. Not Battery Powered. You cannot replace the battery in this Bergan ball...it does-not open. Will Not Order another one at $4.99 per ball.
3,Cool but disappointing,"I bought this as a secondary ball for one of the other Bergan track type toys. My kitten already loves the toy and thought he would enjoy the light up one even more. Unfortunately it doesn't roll very well in the track. Out of the track the ball rolls fine, but for some reason, the ridge of the ball (where the two halves meet) seems to get stuck in the track and doesn't roll as fast as a plain ball. So I put the plain ball back in the track and let him chase around the light up ball outside of the track."
4,Good at night,"I bought this as a replacement for the plain none flashing ball that comes with the turbo scratcher toy but it seems that the battery cannot be changed, so for that reason only, I gave it a 4 and not 5 as I think it is quite expensive when battery is going to run out. Anyway I have a solution that will make it last longer, I only put it in at night because it is especially good in a dark room. The kitten is more attracted to the flashing ball in the darkened room and I swap it back again for the plain ball for during the day, thereby saving battery. I was going to give the ball to her to play with freely out of the toy but then realised that all the time the ball moves it flashes and therefore still uses battery, DOH!! anyway if you save for night time like I do, then your kitty will have extra hours of fun with her 'new' toy, which is what it is all about, keeping them amused and burning off all that hyper energy :-)"
5,Thank goodness amazon sells this!,I've looked at pet stores all across our area and no one carries these!!! Our turbo star chaser is the best cat toy (though pricey) but it makes it worth it that after 2 years the ball died and the replacement isn't that expensive.
2,Scared the Cats,"Yep, it twinkles - quite brightly. Fits snugly in the trac. Scares the heck out of the cats, makes them run away, LOL. Next time I'll just find a 44mm ping pong ball somewhere."
2,"Is it for me, or the cats?",I think this flashing electric play ball is just amazing! I only wish Suki and Precious liked it as much as me!
1,DOA,"Didn't work when it got here, now I have to go to the trouble of returning and getting a new one. For a cat toy."
2,My cats were not impressed.,"But don't leave it out for the dog! Our dog ""killed"" it in one chomp. Maybe if our cats were kittens, they would like it better."
4,my cat didn't care,"Although I thought that the lights would draw my cats attention to play with the ball. I was surprised to find out that he really was not that interested. The scratch pad is what he is all about and is the best scratch option I've ever found. The white ball that came with the scratch pad would have done the job just fine, for the rare chance that my cat will play with it."
2,Didn't last long,Our ball stopped working on day 1. I'd return it but it's not worth the hassle given the small dollar amount. Needless to say I am annoyed. I think it should have survived a 3 ft drop onto the floor. It still works on the rare occasion which indicates shoddy soldering. I'd open it up and try to fix it but I suspect my frustration level in opening/closing the ball would skyrocket. Simply not worth the trouble. They get a second star for amusing my kids while it worked. The cats didn't even get the opportunity to test drive it.
2,Disappointed,"My cats love their turbo scratcher and I thought this would be a real treat for them. Unfortunately, they have played with the ball continuously since it arrived and it has lit up only twice. I am very disappointed. It seems many customers have had success with theirs though, so I guess it's luck of the draw."
2,Short Light Life,I ordered a lighted replacement bulb because our cat LOVES this toy and especially the light. The ball came but it didn't light as well as the original and what light there was only lasted about a week. I plan to order another and cross my fingers that this one work.
5,Cats enjoyed this,"My two cats love the cat chaser toy almost every day, but never played with it at night till I got the Starchaser light up ball. They both took turns making it spin and light up."
4,Fun To Watch,"I replaced the plain white cat track ball with this lighted one and my kittens love to play with it. Sometimes I take it out of the track and play ""mini kitty soccer"" or ""fetch"" with them while I watch their eyes totally fixated on this ball. It's pretty funny to watch them stare at it when it stops moving and realize that they need to hit it to make it light up. This is a cleaver invention that my kitties are having a ""ball"" with."
4,Pretty neat!,"I think the idea of the flashing lights when the ball is moving is pretty cool. My cat is a bit intimated by the lights, but she gets used to them and continues to play. I would recommend this product because it's safe and I bet most cats would have a hoot playing with this at night in the dark when the rest of the family is asleep!"
1,Sadly DOA,"The batteries in the ball were dead when I received it. There is no obvious way to replace them either,"
5,Great product,this product is great but do not let it fall down lol it'll split into two parts and you might need to glue it back together
5,Hallee loves the star chaser!,"Bergan StarChaser Replacement Ball, Colors VaryMy Kitten Hallee loves the ball in the turbo chaser or out of it, that is why I ordered 2 more of the balls.Shirlee, Demorest, GA"
3,Controls rather awkward...,"I would use some type of arcade joystick for this game. Game is a little better than average, RENT it first though."
4,great game overall.,had one for a while on the original platform and loved it.got it again for the 360 with backward comp. and never worked properly.
1,What's the author's agenda?,"I tried some of the questions on a couple of my mormon friends; and to my surprise, I was the one looking stupid. I think this book remarkably underestimates the the intellect of typical mormons,or at least the ones I know. Im not really sure why the author would publish such a book, other than hoping to earn a buck, because the mormon's I know are some of the greatest advocates of doing good to others. The world could learn some good lessons by their examples."
1,Short answers to simple questions.,"I was asked (through email) by one of the authors (William J. McKeever) to answer these 15 questions after writing my review. I answered each question easily. Our correspondence that followed was short, but it strengthened my testimony more than I can tell you.This book is so simple it borders on silly. I do believe that the only people who will find this book even a little interesting are those who already dislike The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.Any Latter-day Saint such as myself will be able to answer these questions (and any others) with ease. All you have to do is ask me."
1,Um...,"Okay, that was pointless. I was hoping for some thought provoking or challenging questions. Not only do I have complete and concise answers to each question, but some of the questions and references are so silly that it is quite obvious that Mr. McKeever didn't bother to actually ask these questions of an even moderately learned Latter-Day Saint before he went to print. I'm almost hoping that someone asks me all fifteen questions in a real world situation. It would be fun. And this coming from an LDS convert of only six months."
1,Pointless meandering claptrap,"This book seems to simply focus on Mormon bashing rather than anything actually ""effective"" or ""challenging"". The questions posed are so horribly infective that it would appear the author did no research at all and simply made them up. The only attempt to be inoffensive is this book's title. This book would not go well in any Christian's library. The answers I received from Mormon friends were not even remotely close to the unresearched seemingly fabricated garbage this book contained."
1,Misled,"I am disgusted by what this book has to offer... if you really have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints(a.k.a Mormanism) contact a member rather than buying this book! not only will you save money, but you will be able to learn some facts about our religion, not commonly told myths. This book was not written by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, so what do the authors know? not too much, obviously. If you have any questions about this religion (ITS NOT A CULT!!) and just want to talk about it, and don't want to be converted, just call up a member of the church, who i am sure will be glad to explain the finer details with you without trying to cram mormon doctorine down your throat. but whatever you do, please please please don't buy this book!"
1,Flawed logic,"Since I don't have the time to pen my own full book in response, I will just address the first question: if (all) Mormons are Christians, are (all) Christians Mormon? That is like asking: if (all) lions are cats, are (all) cats lions?I do have a Presbyterian best friend who is essentially Mormon in her beliefs. Sometimes I tell her she is a better Mormon than I am, which she takes as a high compliment.As a former Non-denominational Protestant Christian, I find it odd and illogical that some Protestants could fathom that Protestants as a whole with all their varied beliefs/doctrines (and Catholics whom the Protestants are protesting) can all be considered Christians, but Mormons can't."
1,Effective Questions?,"Question 1 -- ""If I accept you as a Christian, will you accept me as a Mormon?""The answer to this question, of course, is no. However, this does not imply that Mormon's aren't Christian, it only implies that not all Christians are Mormons.To clarify, consider this similar question. If a Catholic accepts a Baptist as a Christian, must the Baptist accept the Catholic as a Baptist? This, of course, is a silly nonsensical question, yet it is the exact type of question the authors of this book refer to as ""effective"".The questions in this book are not so much ""effective"" as ""affective"", and if you like arguing with your Mormon friends then you should purchase the book."
1,Lame attempt,"If these are the best questions you can come up with to ask your mormon ""friends"" I suggest you go back to the drawing board. From what I've studied the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints offers answers to questions far more complicated than these. I do agree that these questions are not offensive. In fact I would love it if someone asked me one of them, I think it could spark an interesting discussion. I could tell them the simple truths this book seems to overlook. If anyone really wants to know more about the Mormon church all they have to do is ask a friend. As for Bill McKeever and Eric Johnson, three words, bring it on."
1,Every religion borders on being a CULT,"The Catholics have their POPE, others have their Jimmy Swaggarts, etc etc etc. Mormons appear to be very articulate, loving and devoted family people. This book does nothing to address certain issues."
5,Look at what you believe.,"I love Bill, and he's not even my dad, but his books have been a father to me. I have tasted the pie of mormonism, and found the crust undercooked. W4e need to fight lies where we find them, and yank them out like a snake in it's snakepit. And I'm nor referrring to the former guitarist from ""Guns and Roses.""This book ahsd a wonderful format, and easy acess to analize and think for youself, without any input or crossthinking from the course. My goodness, ther is no jibberish in this book, which made my days....This books' tone is quite respectful and kind to all poepl who know the truth. I found the style to be easy to read."
1,haha! bring it on man!,i dare anyone in the world to challenge my beliefs in Mormonism. you have my email. try it.what other purpose does this book hold?BRING IT ON!
1,Didn't work,We've tried most everything for our dog to no avail. This was no different. Good price and quick shiipping just didn't work in our case.
3,"Small and flimsy, but great for the price","I didn't expect much when I ordered this set - I just wanted to start learning how to bake and this seemed perfect. It's a good set for a starter, but the pieces are very lightweight aluminum and will not last long if you're not careful. The loaf pan is smaller than a standard pan (it's 8x4 instead of standard 9x5) so I couldn't use it for most of the recipes since they just wouldn't fit. All in all, though, how can I complain? I got nine pieces of decent-enough bakeware for a great price and it arrived quickly."
4,Christmas gift.,This is a Christams gift for our daughter. And it has everything to bake but a pizza pan and I give her that already. It looks like it's a very good set. For somebody just starting out on her own.
1,poorly made and will rotten in a blink of eyes,"If you have a lots of money and want just waist it, so buy this product, its made from a so cheap materail than it will disintegrate in front of you in your first usage, if you use a dishwasher you will know what i am talking about, and please keep way from your crazy kids cause one drop and it will look just alike a cola can"
1,cheap pans,Pans are cheap and rusted after one use this is the worst pan set ever and should be pulled from shelves.
1,Buyer beware.,The whole set is crap! I washed these one time in the dishwasher and every single pan rusted. Don't order these at all they are worthless and I will be throwing them away. You may seem like your getting a deal but trust me BUYER BEWARE!
5,excellent,for the price I paid the items were great!!! I baked a pie in one of the tins and cooked macaroni... just the set I needed!
4,Good,Very inexpensive. If your looking for high quality commercial grade at a great price this aint them.But if you do as much cooking with these types of pans as I do they are perfect. Absolutely great pricefor very decent pans.
3,You get what you paid for,"Certain pieces are on the small side, not the standard size. They definitely have tin in them as they bend easily. Fine for starting off with your first kitchen, but when I can afford better, I definitely will."
5,Excellent,These products are a good quality and great price. I got them for my sister in law for Christmas and she is very pleased.
3,"very fast service,","the items were a bit smaller than i thought but i should have checked the specs first. they do rust quickly too, but i liek them. good price and they were delivered very fast."
1,bad purchase,"it wasnt worth the money , there not of high or good guality , and they rust easy . i wont be purchasing bakeware online again."
1,Really small,"They're all really small. I thought I was buying a set of pans, maybe not the best quality, but good enough. Not sure if they pass that bar. I haven't used them yet. Wish I would have read the reviews talking about how quickly they rust. Very thin as well"
2,Made for a mini oven,Be careful how much you pay. Quality is comparable to Wal-Mart. I should have read the dimensions more carefully as these are made for a smaller than normal oven. I returned them upon arrival.
1,Bad quality for lowly priced item,"Better to spend some extra dosh on quality bakeware than on this stuff. Quality is laughable. Gets easily scratched, the paint / outerlayer peels off really easily. I should have known better."
2,Tiny cookware!,"This set is very small in size. Good for tiny muffins, tiny 1/2 banana bread loaf, tiny pies, tiny cookies, etc.. You get the idea."
4,Basic Economy Set,"I was looking for a basic economy set of bake-ware that wasn't non-stick when I came across this set. My last set was a ""nicer"" Calphalon non-stick set that rusted and chipped in less than a year. I figure if I'm gonna be replacing them every year there is no reason to spend a alot of money on them and at the price this set was if they were awful I could toss them and not fell bad. By following another reviewer's tip to hand wash and then stick in a warm oven, I don't have any rust spots at all. The ones I received were in good condition and of average weight. They cook evenly and I haven't had any problems with stuck on food spots. Seriously at this price give 'em a try if they don't work or last long you are out less then a meal at an average restaurant."
1,Waste of Money,"I should have read the reviews before I purchased this item. After washing it, I noticed it started to rust! I haven't even used it yet. I wasted my money on this!"
3,I got what I paid for LOL,"This cooking set is perfect if you are moving into your first apartment like I was! But do not, ye, be deceived! The biggest pan does this SCARY thing where it bends a few minutes after it's placed in the oven! It scares the s*** out of me EVERY time and I've been using it since June! This set is not the best quality, but it gets the job done!"
3,Perfect for 1st Apartment,"I purchased these before moving into my first apartment and even though they are a little small, you won't really need anything else unless you are doing A LOT of baking. Also, note that actual cookie sheet is about 1/2 the size of a regular sheet and now I use that as a back-up. Plus, this is an ""ok"" material, it rusts easily if not submerged in water."
2,oops,very very very very very cheep a big waste of time and money i would not even give this to kids to dig in the yard with
3,Not the best but will do.,I needed something fast and cheap for my new apartment so I bought these pans. They do work but rust really easy. Make sure you hand wash and dry right away.
5,Review of The Enchanted Conquest by Danielle Peak,"I really enjoyed this book. The book held my interest and the story was fun and interesting. The book is well written and easy to picture in your head as it is read. The story flows well and is humorous at times. I would recommend this book. It is a fantasy, adventure story written more for the young reader between 8 and 14 years of age, however, could easily be enjoyed by the adult readers. It is amazing that a thirteen year old wrote this book."
3,"Much, Much! Better than her first!","I have been listening to Cindy since her debut album, ""Real Life."" Though now, in retrospect, I find the production in that album overdone, it did keep me coming back for more when ""A Reason to Live"" was released--especially since I had nothing else to spend my money on. The pop songs on this album are o.k., but the ballads begin to show just how much talent has vocally. ""I Will Be Free"" and ""Reaching In"" are knockout performances!"
3,no warranty,The watch came and I reviewed the items in the box. The warranty card has to be signed by an authorized dealer to be useful should something happen. I contacted Amazon and they told me glad you like the watch and we cover it for 30 days. I responded to their blatant oversight and have heard nothing.
3,Way overpriced....the jewelry needs alot of work.,"Santa brought this to my 3.5 year old daughter and she was thrilled. Another toy I would not have paid full price for, I found it on Amazon the week prior to Christmas for $24.88. It went together nicely. However as soon as she played with it the jewelry literally fell apart. The chair is cute and the idea is great, but at $50..I would have cried. I don't feel so bad having paid $25."
5,Great Toy!!,My granddaughter absolutely loves this chair.She was so happy when she opened it for Christmas.I had to put it together right away and she started carrying it next to people she wanted to sit next to.I am so happy she loves this chair.
5,Welcome to the Princess BIG LEAGUES,"I put it together Xmas Eve. Not too bad, I'm a pro now anyway. The onyl piece I lost was one of the 2 dangling diamonds that hang from the headband crown. I found it in January and put it back on, but it's a hook shape so it keeps taking 'vacation' and returning in a few weeks. The chair IS LOW to the ground but built wide and big otherwise. My 5 year old loves it and it's not too 'baby' for her. Everytime she sits i hear the music in the other room. It's a great chair. Lots of jewelery attaches everywhere on it and there's a tiny babri hiding in the arm rest. oooooooh!"
5,My little princess loves this!!,"Santa brought this for my 3 year old daughter, and she loves it. The jewelry and the little princess doll that came with it are great. When her tushie sits down, a regal trumpet theme plays, and it has a lock box seat for her to store more dress-up items. The skirt is better for the chair than for her to wear, and it adds a royal touch. I bought it on sale from amazon.com for only $26, and it was a great purchase. She will definitely be able to get a few years of play out of it!!!"
4,Best seat in the House,This is my daughters favorite toy. She sits on it whenever passing by and it plays a tune. It has neat storage compartments and was easy to assemble.
2,Recordings from Live Concerts,"Nowhere does this Greatest Hits of the 80s CD point out that all the recordings are from Live Concerts. Some people may like this, but in particular, the recording for the Missing Persons song Words is poorly done. Dale Bozzio's vocals are muffled. I really like the Gary Newman song Cars but don't really care for hearing all the cheering fans during the song. If I had known this about this CD, I don't think I would have purchased it."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"The description fails to mention it's NOT the ORIGINAL recordings. Some are live, some are other versions. BE WARNED if you are looking for originals."
4,"Westlife ""The Rose"" CD Single",This transaction went smoothly with no problem. I recieved it in a timely manner and the product was as the seller said it would be.
1,too fast!,"the conductor was way too fast on tempo. especially on Neptune, a piece that needs to be taken slowly to be enjoyed. At times I wondered if he was ON speed or trying to break A speed record! Either way save your money, my recommendation for a bargain ""planets"" is the LSO one with Geoffry Simon."
1,COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"What a disappointment. The title interested me in that I wanted to understand how to defend oneself against mind control.... This book is juvenile, poorly presented and boring. The ideas are neither new nor creative. A child could come up with these. (Please, rubber gloves when you handle mail? Buy a hat to match the one your advisary uses and adjust the band down to make it appear as though the wearer's head is expanding. Give me a break! ) This is about the best advice .....if you were into mail fraud and practical jokes. I am returning this for a refund and really question the author's motivation beyond the material. It is not even entertaining."
4,great book about planes for preschoolers,"This book takes your through a tour of an airport and jumbo jet with a boy who is visiting his pilot uncle. They touch on most kinds of aircraft with clear, pleasant drawings and short descriptions of each. The colors and style are very 1980s, but most kids would not notice or care."
3,Pretty Good,I bought the online e-book. It works. He'll realise he made a mistake. You just have to just learn to stop making yourself so easy for him. I gave it a 3 because most of it is that typical play hard to get stuff that you can find any where online
2,You wont get your lover back this way ...,"Alot of detail that could be said in one paragraph. Basically, get your own life, quit being mean to others, don't believe everything you hear and consider everything you hear is a lie - until you confirm it yourself. Keep your opinions to yourself."
4,E-guide,This book is very helpful if you want to get your lover back. But what if the relationship is doomed? I ran across this e-guide which describes the 6 stages that people go thru when they've been left by a lover. Check it out on [...].
4,It remains to be seen,"I started this book last night, and as I get into the 'nitty-gritty' of how to get my lover back, I am a thousand times more hopeful than I was before I started reading it. Blase Harris really captures the loneliness and despair of losing the love of your life, but seems also to be documenting the steps I've taken already, since I broke up with my lover a month ago today. He writes, ""There is a...very parctical, crucially important reason for getting a lover back. If you don't learn how to make a relationship work, then when? Finding another fish in the sea is not good enough...So long as you and your ex-lover are alive, your relationship is not dead"". This gives me the inspiration to continue, and Harris seems certain to help me find the ways and the words to make it happen.The book is worth reading, if only for the excellent plot summary of Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream""The title, and rather flamboyant cover of this paperback edition is a little off-putting though."
4,More insightfull then I thought it would be,"After reading this book, I realized that love was not in the picture of what I wanted. But the advice is a basic understanding of mutual respect for realationships. I liked it for that reason."
3,Was not helpful in my case,As the other reader writes this book is for men who neglected their women and did not pay enough attention to their needs while they were together. My situation is very different. My lover left me and we live in 2 different places. He loves me but he doesn't want to be with me because he dealt with a lot of my stress in our relationship. Due to long distance unfortunately I have no chance to show him how much I am changed or applying any of the tactics from the book. I am still crushed that we will not get back together.
5,Laughter and tears,"This slim volume of poetry is a treasure--prompting the reader to laugh out loud on one page and bringing a tear to the eye on the next. In the Billy Collins mode, it's poetry that connects."
2,"good product, poor design","being mechanically inclinded i had to repair it because the cone ended up sliding up the shaft, which was a major pain to get back off the shaft, but i went to home depot looked for some THICK washers to put above the cone before i put it back on the shaft, since then it works good and has done 100s of citris fruits."
2,"Not anything like a ""professional"" tool","The juicer is a big disappointment. First of all, it's not big enough to do a grapefruit, which is a big flaw in something designed just to juice citrus fruits. Secondly, the quality of construction is actually fairly poor. The gear box is not holding together tightly after only a single use. I'm not actually sure it was tight when it arrived. I would keep looking if I were you."
1,Poor Quality,"The juicer looks very pretty, however the quality is very poor. The top and bottom part aren't aligned properly. The screws are stripped. I can by hand squeeze an orange and get more juice. I am very disappointed. I asked for this for Christmas after seeing all the positive reviews.I'm trying to get my MIL to give me the receipt number so I can return it to Amazon."
1,Metrokane Defective Cone,The cone will claps under normal pressure and this is almost a year that Metrokane will not take the product back or send us another cone.I would not touch it if I was you.
2,Juicer,"This juicer looks nice, but some of the parts are flimsy, and it is difficult to position the machine to juice effectively. Also, some of the parts are beginning to rust."
5,Read this and it'll help you survive anything.,"I've read most of the documentary and private accounts of this period and how it effected the Eastern German population. This is the best personal account I've ever read, terrifying as it is. The author combines a superb memory with a excellent writing style. She doesn't spare the reader any of the horrors, seen and experienced. The author has the rare gift of being able to paint a detailed picture in words. She didn't need to use much reference material as the details were all in her head. Example, she spelled Admiral Doenitz's name incorrectly. If she had to look that up in a book, which she didn't, she would have spelled it correctly.One warning in reading this book. Be sure you have the time to read it in one fell swoop, taking a break here and there to refresh yourself, and consider how fortunate you life has been. I know one sees it all the time in reviews, but this IS the one book you can't put down more than a few minutes"
2,You'll have to buy a new unit every year,"Might as well get a subscription of this product to replace every year... the seal is notorious for not working and the part is not replaceable. I read reviews from other threads, only to find out, I'm not alone. FoodSaver will not help you. You might get a 10% discount on your next FoodSaver. Gee, thanks. How about letting me replace that part or making a part that doesn't stop working after 1 yr.?"
1,Terrible!,"I just bought the v2040 from Target and it was a complete waste of money. It seals wonderfully; however, it will not vacuum. I have tried several times since getting it home and does the same thing: Makes noise and pulls out a little air only to let it back in. I will be returning it on Saturday."
1,It did not work,"We needed this for a boat trip, and so ordered special next day delivery. When it arrived the sealing bar only sealed half way. When we called the customer service, they said we had to return it insured at our expense, and only when received they would send us a new one, but not special delivery unless we paid extra again.So we called Target and they have it for $10 less anyway, and they said they would replace it and return it. Good reason to shop Target. Wasted $10 plus special delivery though.FoodSaver V2040 Vacuum-Packaging System"
1,not like it used to be,"Had the original food saver for 10 years. no problem. it gave way (-actually i didn't know it, but it just needed new gaskets-) and i got a replacement machine. that didn't vacuum bottles or canisters. they sent me a new one. this one vacuums canisters and bottles but not the bags. they sent new gaskets. still didn't work. now they are sending a new machine, yet again.so, A+ for customer service and D- for product integrity. Guess when Food Saver sold to Jarden Consumer Solutions the quality went down. I won' buy another Food Service vacuum sealer. Too bad.now an addendum a couple of weeks later: the replacement unit they sent didn't work either! so now they are sending the 3rd replacement unit. Unbelievable. Let's see if this one works."
1,not reliable,I have had nothing but problems with this machine. It doesn't vacuum nor seal consistently. I'd never recommend this model to friends.
1,Run from this product,First thing I had to buy new seals as the ones that came with it were paper thin next could not seal with out pushing on the lid sometimes it worked sometimes it didn`t.Now it will not seal purchased 3 different food savers over 3 years and now done with these horrible products by food saver not worth the money period.
2,FoodWaster 2040,"I did extensive research before buying this food saver. For the cost, I felt I made the best purchase. I regret it now.This does not take out all the air. I watch it while it vacuums roughly 80% of the air, but I can clearly see air packets within my bag.I once attempted to seal my strawberries, after it vacuumed and sealed, I thought I was finished, a day later the air had gone out and my strawberries were soft and soggy.I regret making this purchase and will be saving my money to get a better model."
4,Replacement Food Saver,"My previous FoodSaver was damaged by a leak in my roof and although I had bought it very inexpensively, I really appreciated what I could do with it and wanted to replace it. The new one is a great deal fancier than my old one, but it does fill the bill, and then some, so I am a happy camper. It is nice to be able to package food in quantities that work for me, as a single person."
5,perfect,I'm so glad I bought this. Mine works great. I've never had a leak. It's saved a lot of money on ruined foods too. I was able to freeze the leeks from my garden this summer and they're still great. I also did fresh blueberries and they're perfect. No freezer burn.
3,Light duty sealer,"It worked great for a while, easy to use, perfect vacuum and seal, but guess I need something more heavy duty, I've really been doing a lot of sealing, quit vacuuming, called customer service they had me flip the gasket over and it worked again for a little while, found I can press down in middle of lid and it vacuums, now one of the latches has busted and the automatic vacuum shutoff quit working, I have to hold lid down, hit the vacuum button, when it's where I want it, hit the seal button, it's still working, but definitely not hands free, I will definitely buy something more heavy duty next time"
1,Not Satisfied With Food Saver,"I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift. I thought we would save money by purchasing meat,chicken,and fish in large quantities and ""FOODSAVING"" it. Well this appliance does not do as advertised. It doesn't pull the air (foods worst enemy) out of the bags all the time. It seems to have a mind of it's own, works when it feels like it. Yes we read the instructions several times to make sure we are doing it correctly, and yes we use only FOODSAVR bags. Horrible machine. $80.00 for an appliance that is only good for re-sealing snack bags and bags that do not need the air pulled out to freeze. Worst product we have purchased in a long time. What can we do to return. I don't think we have the box it came in. I wonder if the new model that stands upright works any better?????"
1,Food Saver V 2040,"Christmas before last I received the Food Saver V2040 as a gift. My old Seal-a-Meal had bit the dust and I had wanted one of these. I've had nothing but trouble with the machine. It will usually seal the bags just fine but when it does vacuum, it will almost immediately release the vacuum. I've tried all the different size bags which are on the expensive side and end up wasting them. All I can say about this product is it doesn't vacuum but, it does suck. It is a piece of excrement and I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase it."
5,FoodSaver,"The FoodSaver Food Vacuum Sealer worked exactly as the manufacturer described. It is very easy to set up and use. The model V2040 does all the work. All we needed to do was put the food in the bag, insert the end into the Vacuum Sealer and push the button. The machine did the rest."
1,PATHETIC!!!,"Every single person who writes or makes a movie about Harry Potter having some deep, dark meaning needs to get a life. This product is obviously the result of jealousy because of the money J.K. Rowling has made from Harry Potter. Harry Potter is popular, because it's well-written in the books and well-produced in the movies. It's harmless entertainment. People, don't waste your money on buying a piece of junk that isn't even worth the disc it was formatted onto. Trust me on this one, this person wants attention and is jealous that they didn't think up the concept of Harry Potter and his adventures in their scrawny little brain. Harry Potter rocks. Buy Harry Potter movies and books, not this worthless, idiotic JUNK."
1,"Oh dear, How sad.","I find it incredibly sad that people should feel the need to make things like this. It is not a documentary, it is not even a critique, it is a highly biased, reactionary piece of rhetoric that does not entertain or inform.I have heard and read many proponents and opponents of the Harry Potter phenomenon and some of them interesting and worthwhile whether one believes them or not.I was raised to make my own decisions as to what is good and what is not, what constitutes 'evil' and to make a distinction between fact and fiction, truth and mythology. Children of today should also have that opportunity. We can only guide them into reading all aspects of the spectrum and then deciding for themselves what mythologies they are comfortable with be it Harry Potter, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings or the Bible."
3,They're okay,"I put these in my truck with a 30 watt per channel amp. They definitely get distorted at higher volumes. Probably a good bass speaker would help. Overall, they're fine. Made in china, like everything else."
1,Broke in first hour,"They sounded fine when I hooked them up to the Dayton DTA-1 amp that I just purchased. While they are shy on bass, they seemed fine for the price... then I tried putting on the mounting brackets. Two out of the four mounts broke as I was attaching the brackets to mount them. I hardly even turned them and they inner nut broke loose. I tried unscrewing the speaker to get to it, but everything is glued shut. I finally went off to Best Buy and purchased their $35 Insignia speakers. HUGE improvement in sound and durability. They not only have bass, they are all weather speakers as well. Stay away from these. I would normally say, ""You get what you pay for"", but in this instance, you don't even get that."
1,Gunk,These speakers are gunk. One was half the volume of the other and the receiving nut for the bracket was missing on one. The brackets are too flimsy to be of any use.
1,Don't buy these speakers,"Don't buy these speakers they supposedly are for 200 wats and the radio of my jeep is a Dual with only 80 wats And one stopped working only makes noise, using it for a few days .They do not seem to be waterproof as announced. stopped working after rain my jeep had no top at that moment ."
1,Cheap speakers badly packaged.,"Received these speakers today. It had been hit so hard the magnet on the back of the speaker fell off. Cheap, cheap, cheap."
1,My phone speaker is louder,I'm running these with a 2x75 rms amp and I can barely hear them. Not to mention they are made in china.
2,OK Speakers for the money,"I put a set of these in my Baja bug that I'm building for a sand car. They work OK, but aren't fantastic. When I turn them up loud enough to hear over the engine, they distort big time & sound terrible. When the volume is low, they sound decent. They aren't going to work for my application & I'm searching for another set to replace them with. I also had a problem with assembly. If you over tighten the screws that attach them to the mounts, the captured nut comes loose & you can't take loosen the mounts without having to fully disassemble the speakers. These are made in China too, so you get what you pay for."
4,Good speakers for the price.,"I needed rear speakers for my Toyota pickup, and these worked fine. They are not for audiophiles, but they don't cost audiophile money, either."
1,don't buy,Worked ok for 10 months but no longer. They're still under warranty -- but who do I return 'em to? I ordered a different brand and am paying a bit more but hopefully the new ones will last longer.
4,Good Speakers on a Budget,"I use these in my 64 VW bug. I have a parcel tray in the front which these lay on. I have two rear 6x9's as well as a 12"" Diamond box.I basically use these front speakers as mid's and hi's. I have a x-over in my amp so I don't run ANY base to these little guys.They work well for providing mids and hi's but don't think I would trust them much for base."
4,totally absorbing,"First of all, this book was originaly published about eight years ago. Long before MTV picked it up. This story exemplifies life in downtown manhattan in the early eighties. Anyone who lived in downtown NYC during this time will appreciate this story."
2,Disappointing,"Ouch. I picked this up due to the title alone, having never heard of this book before. In my opinion the narration was too restrictive; the story was told in the same fashion it would be told verbally to a casual acquaintance, only scratching the surface of the main characters' personal motives, doubts, fears, and many of the aspects that make a character compelling. Too much text was used describing what happened, as opposed to why and how. I thought it came off very flat, and, as the reviewer from Library Journal said, bland."
2,Catcher in the Rye meets Trainspotting?,"You might get something like this book if you crossed JD Salinger with Irvine Welsh. The book was supposed to be funny according to comments on the outside of the jacket, but I didn't laugh once. What it does tho, is paint a very vivid scene of NY at the time. That much is so on the money, it's scary. It also gives a good reason why an out-of-towner living in NY needs to develop a better sense of street smarts and distrust of humans. Thus, you understand why native NYers are the way they are. I'm one. : )"
3,Not that impressive,"I thought that some of the characters, especially the female ones, were one dimensional, and that the plot was very weak in certain parts. For instance, the career woman, Glenn, gives a near stranger the keys to her house and car? I don't think so. Nersesian might know the streets of New York well but I don't think he understands the human heart and mind nearly as well. All in all though, not a bad effort."
2,What an appropriate title,It's suprising that I read this entire book. The writing is poor and the nameless character that narates this book is unbelievably stupid. I have been as down and out as this guy and couldn't relate one bit. There is something lacking in this book and I'm not sure what it is. Maybe common sense...
3,It wasn't THAT great.,"Now I know why more and more writing contests and submission guidelines are demanding characters other than writers. What a self-absorbed story this is. It doesn't completely suck, but it's about a sorry ass writer, and frankly I'm sick of reading about writers too. It just tells me that the author has done nothing else with his life but trying to become a successful author. And he's bitter about not making it. Well...have your friends ever heard of this book?The prose itself is thoughtful, but the story moves a little slow. I love reading about NYC, but this one did not draw me in. I only picked it up because I saw it at a bookstore and I admit, was drawn in by the title, not because I had heard good things about it. I think the description on the back of the book over-hyped it a little."
3,fun word,"this book is picaresque! picaresque picaresque picaresque. i just wanted to say so. reading this book sapped my ambition for a couple of days and i wanted to be a [mess]-up too. especially since the [mess]-up (the picaro!) has great fortune all the time. also it's always nice to read something that panders to our longing for authenticity, in this case, being able to sink underneath everything and then start over again. so i guess i liked it.also i wished the sex scenes were longer."
2,Very OK,"This was a staff recommendation at my local bookstore. It was very OK. Try Nick Hornby's ""High Fidelity"" for laughs!"
1,AWFUL!!!,"This book stinks!! One of the most idiotic, sappy, terrible, implausible endings imaginable. i threw this book into the garbage with total disgust!! Do not waste your money on this poorly written piece of trash. really weak..."
2,Gripping but Ultimately Vaguely Disappointing,"I would give this 2.5 stars. It starts out engagingly enough but the protagonist's descent into dereliction and vagrancy comes on really fast. Maybe that's the way that it happens in the real world-I don't know. Anyhoo, the author clearly can tell a fine story. It's just that the ending is a disappointment and a bit too clean. I can't see how he would choose to stay with Angela.Ultimately this is a entertaining if not very memorable book."
4,Gritty and Highly Entertaining,"Follows the life of an underachiever who always seems to end up in the worst of situations. Dark, gritty, and provocative look at life in New York city in the 80s. What it's like to live day to day not knowing where you are going to sleep or how you are going to eat. Shows life's upwards and downward swings in the most extreme way possible. A quick, dirty and satisfying read."
5,fantastick,"i read this book, like some of you, because it's from the same publisher as the perks of being a wallflower. this book is depressing and makes takes you on the main character's journey to maturity. great allegory and amusing situations. read."
3,"Should be titled ""The Dummy""","Arthur Nersesian is a wonderfully talented writer, but his greatest work is ahead of him. It is hard to find sympathy (or empathy) for the nameless protagonist who, although quite bright, engages in serial acts of the most breathtaking stupidity. Indeed, it is just this stupidity which frustrates and eventually alienates the reader. Charles Bukowski was the master of this genre, and remains so."
4,A great book to take to school and piss your teachers off.,"I have to admit that it was the title that first attracted me to this book. And after reading other MTV fiction novels, I figured it would be a good book. It was funny to laugh at how stupid the main character is and how much bad luck he is burdoned with. I laughed out loud several times. It only gets four stars because of the horribly dissappointing ending. But it's still a good read."
1,pointless drivel,"Mildly amusing at times, but offers little else than a vulgar, attention grabbing title. Comparisons written by others here between the narrator and Holden Caulfield are funnier than the book itself."
2,A waste of time,"This book follows the life of a complete screw-up living in New York City in the 1980's. Everything about his life is a disaster, and apparently that's supposed to be what makes this book funny. However, after the first 50 pages or so, the stupid mentality of this book got kind of old, and I didn't find anything about the story funny at all. I do not recommend it."
4,Interesting,"Definitely an interesting read. I disagree with some of the reviews that found this a forced read. I didn't find the latter situations the ""hero"" fell into predictable at all.Think of it as a ""worst-case"" scenario slacker model for the mid/late 80's. I know a few people like this guy, of course there situations aren't as extreme...yet.Overall, it was interesting, humorous, and a bit sad. A modern tragedy."
3,shock insight at its best,a true to life tale of one man's struggle down from an already twisted life when almost at the stable comfort level. the title just couldn't sum it up better. great story plus an unexpected culture shock hits at the end. just puts that mirror in front of us all and forces you to see your own actions for what they are. which is just the thing so many of us need to see...
5,Wow!,"it's true that i did get the book because of the title, but what was in the book made it all worth while... Truly amazing and funny, it's kind of reminds me of my own screwed up life... Then again he has it worst... It's amazing how Arthur Nersesian was able to keep our anonymous hero so entertaining even though the basic facts about him are gone... I really recommend this book to anyone who feel their life is screwed up..."
3,Talented writer but story falls apart before the end,"Arthur Nersesian is truly a gifted writer. Only the power of his words kept me reading this book until the last page, long after the story itself ceased to be interesting. Like a 3 hour blockbuster movie that's about sixty minutes too long, this book would have been a five-star, had the story been more compact.It's worth reading this simply for the quality of Neresian's talents as a writer. The main character is compelling and easy to sympathize with, even though he's a slacker who left college just short of graduation, working for minimum-wage in dead-end jobs and sleeping on his best friend's couch. The dialogue is fast and lean, and the vivid descriptions of life in New York make the reader feel as if he was actually there. I look forward to reading Neresian's other work."
3,Ambled Along,"I read this book as its author was recommended to those who like Chuck Palahniuk. While I found the book reasonably entertaining, it didn't grab me like Chuck does.It definately felt a little dated. So if you are nostalgic for the late 70's early 80's and thats something you relate to then by all means grab this book, however if you are looking for something more in line with Chucks work check out Craig Clevenger."
5,Read this book.,"Read it. Let your friends borrow it. This is a good read for high school kids. It is about his guy who goes from having a decent job, and a decent girl friend to a street walker who is digging in trash cans for his next meal, then starts his climb back to humanity. Believe me, it will make you realize how good life really is for you."
3,"good, but something's missing.","although i enjoyed my overall reading experience with this book, i did not like the fact that Nersesian failed to develope the main character enough. this is one of those stories where to fully enjoy it, you have to identify with/feel sorry for the character, and it just didnt happen for me. beyond that, i liked nersesian's voice and style and potrait of manhatten. one thing i did HATE though was the ending. i wont ruin it for you, but lets just say it was a little too, ""life is just wonderful anyway"" for me. blah."
3,And you think YOU have bad luck. . .,Somewhere it says that this book is supposed to be funny. I hate to admit that I didn't crack a smile through this whole thing (I just finished it moments ago) That doens't mean that it wasn't a good book. It held my attention since I started it a few days ago just because I couldn't imagine this guys life getting any worse and yet it does. The thing that I wondered the most though was ..what ever happened to the Mercedes?
4,Fresh,"A plucky narrative, rich in detail, emotionally realistic (if you're a borderline personality) satisfying. Can be very funny at times."
3,I was Expecting sooo much more,"With such an eye-catching title, you'd think that this book would be a real interesting read, right? Well that's what I thought and I was soo wrong. The only way I can describe this book is this: an AWFUL attempt at remaking J.D. Salinger's classic ""The Catcher In the Rye."" You never find out much about the protagonist...except that he's a... ""screwup""...when it comes to EVERYTHING. Throughout the book you'll just be wondering ""can anyone really be this retarded?"" The reason why even I give this book up to three stars is because you can read it on any of your really, really bad days and you'll feel a lot better about yourself. This book had a lot happening in it... but it was still boring as hell. Don't even bother."
4,its okay,i just wish it came with instructions! i did not have one to look at to see how it went on.

5,"A Rare , Gifted Writer","Olivier Monitara's books are a source of many dicussions among Rosicrucians of different Orders . His writings are powerful ,inspiring ,poetic . I feel his love , sincerity and hisDivine inner being . Because I consider him as my brother,though he is a Johannite ,and want him to inspire all his readers, I'll make one negative comment about the book .Olivier should be more careful in the future when writing aboutreal and symbolical people , dates ,and historical events .Blessings upon all"
2,"Mr. Nice, Nice, but this isn't about Essenes","There is not one single footnote or hint of historical documentation in the entire book, although the author leaves commentary on his own writing, as if it were chapter and verse. Anyone familiar with Josephus or Pliny the Elder's writings would find this silly and unresearched. The author has started his own ""School of Light"" church around 1991,and this book is an expression of his philosophy- not a history of the Essenes. If you are looking for words like ""Cosmic Intelligence"" and ""Universal Brotherhood"", and like to sit in the Lotus position in a tai-chi uniform chanting and burning incense, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, the author would have you believe that Jesus was an Essene based on his underwear (p.2,3& John 19:23). On the upside, if you buy the book, you can send off for a free ""Cabalistic Oracle"" method to ""determine your destiny""(yipee)"
3,What happened to the rainforests in brazil?,I picked this book up on Granville Island in Vancouver on a clearance/remainders table out of interest. For people who wonder what has happended to the rainforests in Brazil after much international coverage during the late eighties and early nineties would find this of interest. Kind of sad.
5,Brilliant Idea,"This product is ideal for anyone who doesn't typically consume an entire bottle of wine at one sitting. It takes about 30-60 seconds to pump all the air out of the bottle using the special stoppers and pump, keeping the wine as fresh as if it had not been uncorked in the first place. Brilliant idea. I loved mine so much I've purchased a number of them to give to my wine loving friends and family."
2,Tunjii,"I haven't read the book yet, however, I've seen the movie and it leaves some of the history that I know, out. For instance, in the movie almost nothing is mentioned about Eddie's first true replacement ( though Rick Owens is the first replacement, lasting only two weeks), Otis Damon Harris, why? He was with the group for almost five years. Didn't he sing on some of their greatest hits of the early to mid seventies? Songs such as "" Superstar "", ""Papa was a rolling stone"" ( which won a grammy ), ""Masterpiece"", ""Heavenly"", and "" A song for you "" , among others? Being from Baltimore, Maryland , I take great pride in the fact that Damon was from my home town, and more importantly, in the fact that he sounded the most like Eddie,so much so, that most people who don't know when Eddie left the group, can't tell the difference.He sounded far more like Eddie than any other first tenor who has been in the group since. I do like Ron Tyson, however."
4,Growing up in the 60's,"While reading this book I realized I did not pay enough attention to the groups that made the songs such hits that I listened to and danced to! I didn't pay much attention to who the hottest groups were and with what songs, I just knew the songs I loved to dance to! I now wish I could turn back time and do it all over again. I thoroughly enjoyed this book; while I was getting out of high school and holding down a job, the Temptations were trying to get their music up on the charts. It's interesting to read what their life was like then, reading the book gets you closer to their lives. I feel very sorry for the deaths of Otis' buddies and original Temptations. I'm sorry they aren't all still with us. Otis, if you get to read this, take care of yourself! I hope I see your group on TV soon, how about that for a new idea?"
3,A little disappointing,"Like so many who saw the television drama: The Temptations, this book only covered a certain segment in the life of the Temps, which is not the fault of the author. However, the book did give a window into the world of Motown and a perspective of what it was like for the young artist of that area.It was okay."
4,Gave the history of the mighty temps.,I guess you could call me the ultimate temptations fan. Im a 44 year old white guy from east LA.Ive seen the tempts at least 15 times through the years. It was great to finally get to read about their history. They are apart of american history.
3,Was ok,This book which is a bio of my favorite group temptations. This was a quick and enjoyable read about Motown's best !
3,Classic Temptation Fan,"Read the book, saw the movie. Otis has memories that have probably been clouded with the passage of time. I do remember watching Eddie and Dennis Edwards on Donny Simpson's BET show a number of years ago shortly after Otis' book was first published. Donny asked Eddie about Otis' memories of Paul's spirit visiting him one night and the subsequent discussion Otis had with Eddie regarding Paul's spirit. Not only had Eddie not read the book, Eddie said the conversation with Otis never took place. If Paul's spirit was to have visited anyone, it would have been Eddie given that they had been best friends since childhood and Eddie named his son after Paul. Just food for thought."
2,trying to buy the book,hello my name is veronica and i to like so many do love the temptations and i wont that book that otis put out in aug of this year so please tell me how to buy it?i have been to book store's and they dont have it so please help me think u
1,I'm interested in anything you have to tell me.,I have yet to find the book. Everywhere I go they tell me they can't order the book because it is dated. I want that book and then I'll be satisfied.Help Me
3,LOVE MY PAUL,"I have been a tempt fan every since Iwas 15,when they was on the Ed. SULLIVAN SHOW.lOVE MYSELF some Paul. The book cost me 139.00. The book is nothing like the movie,at times you thing you are reading about a different group.Each time you read something about the tempts its nothing like the movie.It doesnot matter I LOVE THEM. I am collecting videos, from timelife and rhino,there arenot many and a lot of them are not being print again. OH! go to a book store they have a list of book stores, that will find books that are no loner being publish."
4,good,"This book was very good although it chronicalogically revolved around the events,life and times of Otis Williams.There were some plusses added . I'd seen the movie, so the book filled in the gaps.It wasn't until I read the that I found out that the Motown groups considered themselves as a family.An easy read,I would recommend this to anyone that is thirsting for inside knowledge of the Temptations. But just don't stop at this one"
5,Handwriting Book,I bought this for my grandson who has terrible handwriting. It's wonderful. The seller fairly represented its condition and sent it quickly.
4,Classic Text for the Home Library,Excellent overview of plasma physics theory. Covers all the bases. From plasma applications to non-linear effects in plasmas. There is also a great introduction to Kinetic Theory and controlled fusion physics.
2,zzz,I didn't like Chen's style of writing. It could never keep my interest long enough for me to learn anything useful. I always started to get real sleepy every time I picked it up. I found that professor's notes were a lot more helpful for learning about plasmas.
3,Nothing special to be found,"A socialist view of history would probably be an interesting compliment to normal historical bias, if done right. Zinn, though, covers minor movements and events and somehow takes these to be the sum of modernity. Hardly revealing or informative, this book didn't impress me well. It's like one of those histories that claims the Civil War was the War of Northern Aggression..one-sided to the extreme."
1,Tedious and biased,"I started this book with an open mind. I soon realized it was the most biased history book I had ever read on any topic. Even those readers in ideological sync with the author will rapidly become aware that the book's common thread is the universal interpretation of facts and events in the light of Zinn's socialist agenda, no matter how credible the result. The author's admission of his own biases does not make for its lack of deep and insightful analysis of the major events of American history in the 20th century. Furthermore, its style, with serial quoting of individual opinions, of course always on the same side of the story, makes it a shallow, dull, tedious and repetitive read. Is this terrible book the best intelectual product that the radical left has to offer?"
1,Can't Believe In Him Anymore,"After reading that Howard Zinn does not think it is important to investigate 9/11, I will have nothing more to do with him. I don't care how renowned he is. If he doesn't think it's important to stop the false flag operations that have gone on for many, many decades that have thrust us into wars that were instigated by interested 3rd party investors to cash in on the vast fortunes made when they finance both sides of a war, then he will get no support from me. Wake up people! Aren't you tired of being played like a puppet on a string. Watch ""JFKII: The Bush Connection"" and ""Empire of the City: Ring of Power"" on YouTube.[...]"
1,"biased revisions of history, mostly just angry opinions","This is one of those ""Columbus was really a jerk"" books. It's probably the best of that type of book, but the book is clearly slanted. The author even admits this, saying something along the lines of how all history is biased, so someone ought to write something biased this particular way. Sheesh, things like this make me believe we're at the end of civilization."
2,get a late version of people's history of the U.S. in stead,"With this book, I was expecting Zinn to go into more detail about America in the 20th century, but it is essentially the 20th century chapters of People's History of the United States taken out and labeled as a new and different book. If you have an older version of Pepole History of the United States by Howard Zinn, the Twentieth Century might be good because of the chapters relating to the elder Bush and Clinton administrations. The rest of the chapters are in people's history. However, recent version the people history of the united states do contain the extra chapters so if it would be better to just get a later version of People's History of the United States instead if you don't have a copy yet."
4,Old-style fun,"Retief, the unorthodox diplomat, is assigned the hardest jobs(often self-assigned), works against incompetence and active opposition from his side, not to mention the opposition's opposition - and succeeds. This was one thing I enjoyed when I first read the stories in the magazines, and maybe what I enjoy most now. You don't have to have perfect conditions or helpful allies to get results. This is frequently screened by strange-looking aliens, odd cultures, color and glitter, and some laughs - but those are also aspects of the stories that I enjoy."
4,Great stuff for 6 year old boys (and non-squeamish moms),"My 6 year old is just beginning to read & chose this from his school library because he's fascinated with all things bug-like. He enjoyed reading this (with help from me on the big words) and was pulled in by the vibrant photography and grossed out by some of the facts (the egg sacs in particular). I asked him the questions presented in the story but he was too worn out to answer them. Still, we both learned lots of interesting new things about spiders. Did you know that some spiders have 8 eyes? I've seen the picture to prove it! Another highlight was seeing a close-up of an intricate zig-zag spider web & another very messy web. Wow, it'll almost make me think twice before shooing the critters out of my house & destroying their webs. I'd recommend this for a 6 year old boy or girl interested in bugs."
4,Very good,This is very good unfortunately it is just violins and cello I was really looking for more instruments. I am not disappointed though.
4,"Vivaldi, The Four Season",I bought this for my Mother. She listens to the CD all the time.She enjoys this type of music.
3,Good product; Quick Service: No Instructions,"The product we recieved was everything it was advertised to be. We did get our impression kit and teeth whitening material quickly. However, it didn't come with any directions at all! When I emailed smilemedic with questions on how to take the impressions and how to use the product, they responded to only some of the questions. After a few emails back and forth, we completed the impressions. After sending them in we got our molds back in about 10 days. The product has worked well and we are happy with the results so far. A suggestion to smilemedic is to have all the instructions sent with their products or list everything on a web-site so a custumer can download this information for themselves."
1,did not fit,"I read a review that it fit a vivatar tripod, but when I recieved it was too small so it must have been a different model, having dimension of the clamp section of the base would have eliminated this purchase, and I would have been able to figure out which one would work."
2,I'm sure it works fine - for the right tripod,"I lost the quick release plate for my tripod. I reviewed this one very carefully and thought it would work on my tripod, but when it came, I found it is a different size - too big, even though it is the same brand and looked like it would work. I'm very disappointed and don't know where to find another one. Next step is to call the company and find out if there is one available, but there's very limited info on the tripod to make a match."
2,Davis &Sanford QRPER Ranger Series Tripod,"Did not fit! Although the reviews stated from others that it was perfect, it wasn'tFor our Cannon Rebel XLS"
3,Intriguing,"The orchestra on this CD is scrawny, and plays barely competently. That on its own should exclude this disc from consideration, except that the soloist, Reznikovskaya, is actually very good. She possesses a solid and fluent technique, beautifully adapted to Mozart. She plays these works with a superb sense of structure and beautiful lyric qualities. Her tone is unfailingly lovely. Tempos in the middle movements are on the slow side, but you always feel that Reznikovskaya is heading somewhere and not dragging. I have often felt that when hearing pianists on Infinity, such as the equally excellent Igor Urjash and Pavel Jegorov, that they deserve first class presentation as befits such artists. The sound engineering on this CD at least is very good, clear enough so you can hear the one double bass chugging away over and over again. At this price, you might consider this CD for an interesting perspective on these works, though I hardly could recommend it as a reference edition."
1,disapoint selections from a great score,"I personally hate it when songs are printed in different keys from the original recording, or they are printed in an abridged form. This is the case with this volume from the under appreciated Sondheim show ""anyone can whistle"". Not only are the above mentioned problems present, but one of the best songs (See what it gets you) is given a slow blues tempo that just doesn't compare to the manic tone of the original. Granted, the shows most famous song (there won't be trumpets) is included, but again, it is in the wrong key and some of the lyrics are wrong. The mayoress' (played by Angela Lansbury and Madeline Kahn) song ""Iv'e got you to lean on"" (another toe tapper) is also presented abridged and in the wrong key. Abd the lovely duet ""with so little to be sure of"" is presented here as a solo, with the wonderful counterpoint female part ommitted. it is a shame that this show wasn't given a better treatment"
3,Soundtrack is Excellent!,"I love this CD, it makes you feel like you are watching the movie all over again! The Main title music is absolutely fabulous!"
2,only 3 good songs on here!,"I used to have this CD and the only good songs on it are Michael Jackson's will you be there, NKOTB's- Keep on smilin and the song by 3T"
2,not sure about this but will order,"The review says that ""intriguing"" connections were made...as between the ""American suburban home"" (something 100s of millions of people lived in), and the ""nazis"" (the national socialist Germans). As a kid growing up in the Sixties in America, never hearing anything anti-semitic, ever, (in fact, had people who fought with the allies, in the war), and yet being constantly talked about 'as if I was a bad nazi german"" I am interested in this book. This reminds me of movies, like Wolf Rilla's village of the Damned, where the germanic looking children are evil/aliens. He, I later learned, was from Germany and Hitler didn't want his father in Germany anymore (his father was also a producer). I was very affected by these voices as a kid (in moives like that, and also just this weird implication that I was evil. I hope this book clarifies why we were treated this way. I think a lot of such kids decided not to raise families in the U.S."
4,Christmas present for my sister,Product was received as advertised. As it was a present for my sister I'm not sure she has played it yet. Was very please with the prompt delivery and condition of the merchandise.
2,Avoid this Scheherazade,"If you are looking for a recording of Scheherazade to download, I would suggest not picking this one. It is played by an amateur orchestra. They make a brave effort but in the end, the performance is unsatisfactory. There are plenty of other recordings much better and some are even cheaper. I would suggest the London Philharmonic recording. I believe it is two dollars cheaper and far superior. The Suite is a fine performance played by professionals."
2,A nice start...,"This book poses many questions, but answers none. Too suggest that this man was indeed Alexei and not back it up with a DNA test is pointless. I was totally captivated by the book until I reached the end, then I was disappointed. Spend your time reading something else. This book adds nothing to the countless theories about what happened to the youngest Romanovs."
1,All the makings...,...let us know when the DNA testing is complete on Vasily Filatov and the other parties involved. This make a buck on a book is infuriating! Lysenkos book is no more than another piece of Anna Anderson trickery. Photographs with a line here and a line there; handwriting analysis with a loop here and loop there. Filatov may be the Tsar's son or another Anna! I'll give Anna her due...she's in the history books as one of the greatest tricksters.
1,All the makings...,"DNA testing remains key. To date, Lysenko's book presents still yet another infamous Anna Anderson story in the making. Photographic comparisons with a line here and a line there; hand writing analyses with a loop here and a loop there. Vasily Filatov could be the Tsarevich...just as Anna Anderson was the Duchess Anastasia. Anderson was a great trickster. AND Filatov may be the same!"
4,Intriguing photos make this book,"an exciting one. Since the discovery of the two missing children from the Romanov execution, hundreds of Alexei ""claimants"" have emerged from the shadows. I believed this was another tall tale, with dubious documentation and much irrelevant information for followers of the assassination -- until I saw the photos of the family. ""Hmm,"" I thought, ""That's a great photo of George V."" Then I saw the caption! Buy this book if for no other reason. The DNA testing must be done on these people. Any funders?"
3,A Book That Makes You Questioin History.,"I find it hard to acept the story as written, the sickly Alexie was so ill it would take a miracle for him to have survived. It was very fact directed as the author read books on the last family of Inperial Russia and used them as notes. It was interesting that Alexei and one sister was not found in the grave at Pigs Meadow. Of course Anna Andersonlived and died in Virgina at age 82. I have heard that additional remains were found a few years ago but I still think remains from the first grave were used to ""find the missing two.' The DNA test were used to discredit the one true survivor because the truth would have enbarrised the English Royal Family, who refused to provide saftey to the endangered Royal Family of Russia. Simply once the grave was found, they had to account for all of the family, true or not. Do you really think Russia would tell the truth that one escaped the murder?"
2,Somewhat Disappointing...,"The fantastic idea that the last czar of Russia escaped death, and the possibility that he died an old man after a long life is what drew me to this title. Though it was detailed about what was thought to have happened that summer night in 1917, it seemed to lack substance about the man himself. It also left me with a huge questionmark about the fate of the Princess that also went missing: Anastasia. It was, however, interesting to read about the conclusions of the handwriting samples, and pictures of Vasily's children standing with pictures of the Romanovs. The old adage ""The truth is stranger than fiction"" applies here. I still recommend it."
3,The Escape of Alexei?,"I don't think so. At least I'm not convinced. I found the history and the narrative fascinating. However, when I got to the doctored pictures, I thought, ""Hey, a DNA test would settle the question."" Why hasn't it been done? There was talk of ""not enough money"" but surely a DNA test can't be all that expensive, and they've already been done on the Romanov remains found in the mass grave.This book included documents and photographs I had not seen before. I intend to keep it because it is interesting.By the way, at the time of the Alexei and Anastasia ""pretenders,"" how did they know that two bodies were missing from the grave, and how did they know which two were missing?"
2,"The book is so repetitive, it was hard to finish","As with books on the possible escape of Anastasia, Alexei's older sister, this story reads like a fable. The author(s) stressed, over and over again, every single angle regarding the night of the massacre, and all of the analysis which took place in recent years on bones found to be from the Russian royal family. There are numerous pictures trying to compare the children of Vasily Filatov with other members of royal families related to Tsar Nicholas II. Many details are revealed about Vasily Filatov, and it's presented over, and over, and over again. A good fifty to seventy pages could have been cut from this book, and still told the basic story. Do I believe these allegations that Alexei and Vasily Filatov are one person? No . . . but it's still nice to think that someone escaped the massacre. But no . . . I don't think so."
1,Time Well Spent...Doing Something Else,"This book is absolute rubbish! Don't even waste your money on it. You'd do better reading The Cat in the Hat rather than this. For any Romanov fan, this book is a must-a must throw in the trash. I don't know why people still insist that Aleksey survived Ekaterinburg. Just drop it. He didn't survive. Anastasiya didn't survive. Maria didn't survive. None of them survived! They most likely just burned the two ""missing"" bodies and scattered the ashes around the site..."
2,Missing Romanov's FOUND.,"This book had merit at one point, but back in 2009 the bodies of Anastasia(Or Maria), and Alexei were indeed found and confirmed to be dead, and were buried with the rest of their family. So everyone that came forward claiming to be either of them has now been proven false. So this book is worthless now. Though it was very convincing, and intriguing back before the bodies were found when I read it."
1,A Hemophiliac Survives Being Shot?,"Alexei Nicholaevitch was a hemophiliac in poor health at the time of the Imperial Family's assassination. He could barely walk, and had to be carried by his father to the basement of the Ipatiev house, to say nothing of suffering direct shots into his ear. To say that he could have escaped is preposterous. Try ""Nicholas and Alexandra,"" all those who want a plausible recounting of history!"
3,So test the DNA already!,"Presents an intriguing theory about the possible survival of the tsarevich from the massacre in which the Romanovs were killed. But the physical evidence of familial links between Vasily Filatov and Alexei Romanov presented in the book is precisely the kind of once-persuasive evidence that led many to believe Anna Anderson's claim to be Anastasia (a claim debunked by recent DNA comparisons). Since DNA profiling has now been done on the Romanov remains, this book strikes the reader as incomplete in the absence of definitive DNA testing of Filatov's remains and comparison with the existing information on the Romanovs."
3,Great Strength Builder!,"Got this for my son when he was 7 months old and just starting to ""comando crawl"" He doesn't gravitate to this toy to play with, but I often put it in his way when he is moving to get another toy. I have really seen his balance and strength improve and I think a lot of it has to do with this toy! He does like to sit on it while I hold his legs and move him forward and back. He needs to try and keep his balance - and enjoys that now he can! This is a great toy for parents to use to help their little ones develop balance, strength, and sense of self in space."
1,It looked like fun,"I thought my 8 month old would love this as he's been crawling for a few weeks now and tries to crawl on everything in his path. Unfortunatly, despite several attempts to get him to play with this, he's always chosen to ignore it and pursue other objects in the area. It's one of the few toys he's shown absolutly no interest in. Have no idea why.On another note, be sure not to leave it in the middle of the nursury floor. When bringing a sleeping baby in the darkened room you'll at a minimum cause such noise as to wake him up, assuming you catch you balance after stepping on it...."
5,good start,"This book is ideal if you haven't got a clue about differential diagnosis. It is bringing together all the pathophysiology knowledge into daily practice. The cases are really good and well explained, leading the reader through the diagnostic thinking process. This is how patients will present themselves to you."
2,"Millers Forge Fine Tooth Comb, 8-inch",The teeth on the fine tooth comb are close like the flea comb. They bend easily so the comb was not what I had expected. The older Millers Forge combs with the metal handles were made far nicer and easier to work with plus the fine tooth comb in the older version was perfect. This product should have been listed as a flea and tick comb.
5,Fantastic CD,"Kinda shocked that I'm the only one to review this great cd by one very talented singer-songwriter. It's a heavy burden for someone about to go to sleep to summon up the just the right superlatives that will get you to order this, so I'm going to punt and just say I've listened to this countless times and I never tire of it. There's a plaintive quality to Barbara's voice that I just love, and her songs--both music AND lyrics--are great,too, as are the session musicians. You will not be disappointed."
5,Couldn't put it down,"I absolutely LOVED this book and I couldn't put it down once I stated reading it. ""Secrets..."" is a great read. I loved getting the ""inside scoop"" on the life of a tabloid reporter! I hope book number two is soon to follow. I gaurantee that whoever reads this book, will come out of reading it with a newly found appreciation for what a reporter must go through to get the ""scoop""."
3,"Ok, but not enough","When I started reading this book I expected tons of juicy gossip. I got some, but not enough and too much about this reporter and her relationship with her boss and gripes about working for this rag. I have to say there is SOME gossip of interest, but over all, just not enough. The book should be far bigger, considering her 20 years working for the paper."
1,Horrible don't waste money,I bought this to do porting. The mandrel bent right away and the sanding rolls are held together with a rubber band?? These are complete junk.
2,poor quality,poorly made did not hold up. Had to get some more went to harbor freight got better ones for less money.
2,Product description misleading,"It was advertised as Healthy Sexy Hair chocolate soymilk shampoo, however, upon receiving the item it was not the chocolate soymilk shampoo but the regular soymilk shampoo. I would certainly not purchase this item from Amazon again and will buy from ebay."
5,The Dirty Thirty: Words Smart People Will No Longer Misuse,"I refer to my copy of Dirty Thirty often. It is a resource and great fun. It is so easy to read, and sometimes I just pick it up to see what I remember from the last reading. I have purchased more copies to give as gifts. I thought I knew what some of the words meant until I delved deeper. The subtleties between infer and imply are small, but significant. I was ingenuous about how much this powerful book could help my vocabulary. Now, I feel ingenious!"
5,best book on venice,"I have read and used at least 10-15 guide books on Venice in 4 trips there and this is far and away the best to have with you in Venice. Others might be more interesting to read before you go, but if you need to carry only one there, this is definitely the most useful as you travel around town and need times, prices, locations, etc. It is also the most up-to-date on everything."
2,Meh,"I moderately enjoyed the first of this series, although I preferred the chapters about Rap because he's a much more interesting character.Unfortunately, Rap only occupied 30-40% of the first book. In this one, he's in less than 25%.Ultimately, I got bored and put this down 60% of the way in."
3,good but slow,"This book is well written, creative, with interesting characters...but very slow moving. The pace of the story lacks momentum, hence my 3 stars."
3,Not for Flex TT5 or Mini TT1,"I returned the product, because it was wrong cords and i had to pay for shippping and handle. It doesn't fit on the Pocket Wizard flex tt5 or mini tt1. Don't buy it! Too pricey too.. You can get a mono cord from radiostack for $4 each cord.. Why spend extra money? weird, huh?"
2,Young Adult Space Opera Fun,"For once I agree with at least half the reviewers. For simply plotted well-paced space opera, this is it. If you are looking for anything more than pure escapist romp, look at Simmons or something else with a bit more sophistication. Well, honestly almost anything else would be more sophisticated. It has the funny deja-vu like feeling that all good pulp has--but this is a real doorstop of a book which frankly put me off. It's a bit of an investment in time for stuff that is really pure fluff. On the other hand, as people have pointed out, Gear can and does deliver the goods and it IS reasonably entertaining sf fun."
2,If you're a teen age male you'll love it.,"Gear really knows how to target his audience. If you're a young male (majority of SF readers), i.e. you've got raging hormones corsing through your body and think mostly about sex, you're going to love this series.Every female character Gear describes is extremely beautiful with a great body. Every male is a buffed, take no prisoners warrior. There's even an avenging lesbian babe in it. What more could a young kid want?!I found the story line weak and the plot resolution a let down. Gear bounces the from battle to bed to battle to bed, which will grow very tiresome for serious SF readers.If you're into military SF and sex, buy it. Otherwise, this one is a leaver."
3,"Weak writing, but a fun space-opera story","Gear's writing leaves something to be desired-- as in, more skill with words. This is not a book or series to read if you're seeking to become a better writer. But for sheer, old-fashioned, space-opera fun, this series gets the job done. The previous reviewer is right; you definitely have to be in the mood for this sexy/violent brainless romp. As far as that goes, though, it's pretty darned good, and fun. It's sort of ""Dune"" without the deep thinking."
4,Nicely done...,"Included here are 7 selections combined to make a most desirablehour of listening pleasure. From Tchaikovsky to Barber, we get a well played and recorded program of works, usually found on discs featuring a single composer. The big work ""Romeo and Juliet"" comes off nicely, but the other shorter works also shine.The ""Volcalise"" includes the soprano solo version as a bonus.This is an excellent disc for those on a budget, those filling gaps in their collections, and for those begining to appreciate the classics. Virtually unknown conductors and obscure ExSovietorchestras are the performers, and for sure there are better performances of all this music. Hence my reservations on giving a 5th star. Basic notes on each selection included!"
1,Not as pictured.,The vender sent an item that was not as pictured. The only resolution offered for their error was for me to pay return shipping. Stay away from this vender.
5,Excellent for sink faucet with small nozzle,"Mine is exactly as pictured.Excellent for a sink faucet with small nozzle. The nozzle on my faucet is a 7/8"" diameter tube that extends 1 1/2 - this one grips it perfectly, very tight.Not for tub faucets.Not for fancy faucets that have a very big diameter or don't have at least an inch-and-a-half long tubular shape.Very flexible hose - much better than my last one.The descriptions on all of these sprays should specify the dimensions of faucet that they work with. Models for use with tub faucets don't work with sink faucets and vice-versa."
1,Doesn't work,This does not fit on a bathroom sink faucet. It was absolutely useless. If I could rate it zero stars I would.
5,Shampoo Spray Blessing,My husband is a 4 time major stroke victim. He's had two major strokes on each side of his brain. After his last one I can no longer get him in and out of the shower or tub but he can stand at our sink and I can wash his head and he feels wonderful when I'm finished. This item was not at all costly and for the job it does and allows me to do I'd have to say is a Blessing. I'd recommend it to anyone with health issues. I also use it for bathing our dog. Works like a charm!
4,Good enough!,"Delivery was prompt. The quality was good, though the hose length is a bit on the short side."
1,unusable,"The end that attaches to the faucet does not fit and won't stay in play, making the entire thing unusable. Very disappointed. More information about its adaptability would have been helpful."
2,Utility hose sprayer,"I had one of these products before which I bought over 15 years ago. It wore out and I have been looking for a replacement for over a year. I was very excited when I found this one. If you look at the picture, you will see that the part that attaches to the facet is straight - which would not interfer with the flow of water. The unit I got has a ""L"" fitting to the facet which interfers with the flow of water and sprays water all over the laundry room sink area where I am trying to bath the dog. Also the head is not as shown and the spray is not sufficient to rince soap off the dog. The only thing I can say is that it allows me to bath the dog - messy and difficult - but I can get the job done......."
4,shower shampoo spray,"Item was a good replacement for a very similar but much, much older shampoo sprayer that we use for for washing a small dog in a basement sink."
1,shower shampoo spray,This item cost me $17.00HPI 44100101 SHOWER SHAMPOO SPRAYincluding shipping. It fell apart as soon as I hooked it up to the faucet. It was a piece of crap!!!!
5,Deeply hidden chords that someone else must strike...,"A collaborative effort with virtuoso violinist Dr. Nigel Kennedy, this album finds Mr. Duffy's romantic songcraft polished to an epic sheen. The violin stylings add a Steve Reich-like edge to the songs, broadening the sonic impact of Mr. Duffy's pop observations. Big, melodic, electric, and lyrical, the title track is one of his best tunes ever. This is a fantastic album to get lost in. The interplay between impeccable pop and the edgy, modern string arrangements give this album an edge and a depth that, while immediately appealing, also reward close attention and repeat listenings. If you like atmospheric, melodic songwriting, you will find much to savor on this disc."
4,Nice album,"Local band from the area where I live. I like this cd a lot, definitely worth buying if you like fun blues."
4,Must Every Reminiscence Be A Regret?,"As also in later works, here (in 1997), Banville cast a late middle-aged male in a state of reminiscence, so there are then and now figures at a centre of one man's life story. Some research apparently went into depicting the elite British double agents of the 30s and 40s, of the public schools (reviewers have pointed to Anthony Blunt and others), but nothing much happens in the way of espionage in this account, so comparisons to le Carre don't make sense, and the supposed shock of exposure is here rather underwhelming. The title seems misplaced. But that's not what Banville is about. This Banville is again for the beauty of writing and his powers of observation. He's never driven by gorse in an open or closed automobile without remarking on the cloud formations looming over his narrator."
5,Amazing,"This book is quite an accomplishment. It's not often that the author makes one sympathize with the character in a book while at the same time showing clearly what it is that makes that character so deeply obnoxious. Banville's Victor Maskell, based on Anthony Blunt, is a memorable character indeed. The book has not only an extremely absorbing plot line, but also shining passages of prose which make one stop, re-read, and then re-read again. Maskell is jaded, and cynical, but only too human too. His treachery is convincing and comprehensible. Were these Blunt's thoughts too? Who knows, and indeed, who cares. This is a fine, fine novel."
5,So much to savor. Turned it over and started it again!,"This book, by the marvellous John Banville, is so well written that I did something I have never done before in all my long years of reading and teaching: I finished the book and turned back to the beginning and reread it. It was such a finely tuned novel, with so much to savor, I did not feel I had fully (or even barely) appreciated Banville's style and diction while I was moving through the plot the first time. The second time was such a revelation in the details of his work! And, this is not even the work of Banville's that I have loved most. But it was one that really rewarded my second immediate reading. May have to reread it a third time, but will wait a bit. He's a terrific writer and one needs to marvel over each sentence and the crafting of his images. No speed-readers need apply."
1,disapointing reader,You need plenty of patience to read this book. Slow and non-exciting to say the least. Very disapointed. I'll never buy another book by this author.
4,Touches of brilliance...,"I've read about one half of Banville's output now so I guess you could say that I'm a fan of his work. The negative aspects of this book highlighted in other reviews here, I recognise in doses. The draw I feel to this book and many other of his works is as has been pointed out elsewhere, that Banville can portray the everyday with such a delicious twist. Some people like their reading matter to lead them along a path rather than to be a vehicle for appreciating looking at life with your head cocked to a rakish angle....The book reflects what is rewarding in what is not immediately accessible. I have read books with more suspense and action and are still well written. I have however never read books with more liquid lyricism than the books by this author or other comparable authors i.e. Julian Barnes esp. Flaubert's Parrot."
1,I Did Not Like It.,"If you want to read about a self-centered main character with no redeeming qualities, this is your book. If you want to read something that inspires you or teaches you something of value, this is not your book. To make matters worse, the author is one of those who insists on using overly complex sentence structures and words that are outside the normal vocabulary. I kept hoping that the book would yield something of value, but it didn't happen. Now I have to get rid of some nasty images that added nothing to the story except vulgarity. I am sorry that I finished it."
1,BORING,"A literary thriller that is too literary to be thrilling, this is a turgid, torpid and really boring novel about a very unintersting man. He finds his life story fascinating but you won't!"
2,"the writing extraordinary, the plot boring","I finished about 200 or so pages of this book and I would not recommend it as pleasure reading to anyone other than writers or literary scholars. The positive aspects of the book are 1) the writing/use of diction is one of the best i have read 2) in the beginning the story seems interesting and often intellectual. The negative: 1) Banville's story turns out to be incredibly banal (no action, long-winded explanations of irrelevant subjects like a painting) and it is hard not to lose interest.If you are going to read this book, do it solely to enjoy the Banville's style of writing, but do not expect much more."
2,Boring and clichid,"I think Mr. Banville backed himself into a corner by making his narrator a total bore. His supposed insights are virtually all clichis. Though maybe I'm crazy, since the professional reviewers all seem to believe it's the best thing since the invention of the wheel. Anyway, I gave the book two stars because a large vocabulary should count for something in this world."
5,All the World's a Stage,"""The Untouchable"" is a superbly crafted novel loosely based on the life of Sir Anthony Blunt, one of the lesser members of the Cambridge ring of spies led by Kim Philby. Its unmasking shook Britain's Establishment to its core. But Banville seems to be after more than a novelistic retelling of that famous spy story. For ""The Untouchable"" is also a character study of a man--Victor Maskell--who cannot be himself with anyone; Maskell thus constructs a world that enables him to play many parts, sometimes at the same time. It is that essential emptiness at his core that in the end leads to his downfall. But Banville--an Irish novelist who commands the idiom of upper class English with astonishing skill--also seems to be grappling with his own special issue: how to retain an Irish consciousness in an English world of letters. The book is a tour de force"
2,Going downhill real fast,"When I reviewed The Dark Wing I gave it 4 stars but said it was a bit too mystical for me. I also thought you needed a glossary to keep track of all the alien mystic terms. By the time we get to The Dark Ascent, that glossary need to be an interactive dictionary run off a cray supercomputer. While some mysticism is certainly part of the storyline, this much is like The Dark Destroyer come to annihilate the storyline. I tried reading the health care bill and it was a very similar read. Since I purchased all 4 books in the series at the same time I will read the fourth one, but this is a really good storyline line which is well told but has been made into agony trying to keep track of the very many mystical heroes and terminology. Very disappointing."
3,Is This a Luciano Album?,"I'm a big fan of Luciano (see my other reviews), but I don't care much for this record. It's not terrible, but it's not nearly up to the standard of his best work. The problem, basically, is that he does nothing but sing here. Not one of the songs was written by him. The result is that the spiritual depth of the lyrics on his best records is mostly lacking here. The voice still rings true, but that's about it, really."
5,I love Patti,I have watched this DVD over and over again. I have no complaints with it at all. I love her voice and you can tell she really love her fans.
2,Hmmmmmmmmm,"When Luther Vandross came out to sing with her, it was good; when Bryan Adams came out it was pretty good (despite his greasy long hair). Patti has a great voice; but she screams too much (almost like her one female guest Mariah (Pariah)."
3,Alright,"The reason I gave this book a low rating is because it is the reprinting of an informational pamphlet on Judo from 1937, and is hardly worth the $12 that I paid, it probably cost $2 to print because of the short length, about 60 pages, and I would recommend to just invest a few more dollars in Kodokan Judo, it is all you would need without this book. The information contained within was informative, but definitely not worth the $12 paid."
2,boo..ring,"Scenery is nice 5/5. Acting is 2/5. Plot 2/5. If you have nothing to do, burn some time, cannot go to sleep, etc.. this is the movie to watch. It will definitely put you to sleep and time will seem longer. To watch this movie, fast forward a lot, watch to the end. Now go back to the beginning and watch it again to pick up what you miss. This movie is good if you wantto watch scenery."
1,An awful Redbox special,"This is a movie that I found on Redbox, and let me be clear that it just illustrates that with the new technology anyone can become a movie producer. This was poorly shot, poorly planned, and contained horrid acting. It looked as though some drinking buddies got crocked one night, and said ""hey lets make a cowboy movie."" Guess, what they did it, and it shows in this awful movie that no one should have to watch. I cannot tell you how bad this thing happens to be. Avoid it and save yourself a buck."
1,Slower than watching a mule walk.,"The first thing you notice is how sloooow time is moving as you doze off while watching a bunch of people riding or should I say walking their horses while going nowhere except to some poorly scripted dead end at the hands of some guy that just shows up and shoots them dead seemingly always about in the same spot. Even the fatal gunshot was always in the same chest spot. I guess the props people must have used the same red paint blood seeping vest over and over again. That's the whole movie.Dialogue was bizarre in that it sounded more like some one from Hollywood trying to imagine how people talked back then. Always amusing when they use some contemporary phrasing.Acting was mostly a crew with little experience or maybe a few TV spots and a few well known titles such as ""Terror at Blood Fart Lake"", ""Stiffed"", ""The Stink of Flesh"", ""Rotgut"".Directing and cinematography gave us a lot of scenery of sage brush desert. Exciting!"
3,"Better then most of the new westerns, but still boring and acting is very flat. For hardcore fans only. I say C","""Nobody needs the trouble but we all need the money."" After a local bank is robbed a group of outlaws begin a chase to find the money. There is not much to say about this movie. Like most of the westerns lately it is flat, pretty boring and full of bad acting. This one is not as bad as most mainly because it is so boring and the acting is flat and emotionless there is really nothing to talk about. This one has quite possibly the worst ""duel"" gunfight scene I have ever seen it's almost worth watching just to see that. Overall, better then most of the newer westerns that have been released, but still for the hardcore western fan only. I give it a C."
5,Atlantis located!,"JJ Hébert has finally located Atlantis. He locates it in the discussions of Solon with an Egyptian priest who had access to centuries-old scrolls. While most scholars had insisted Atlantis be situated west of the Straits of Gibraltar (which doesn't make any sense, since the Greeks never ventured beyond Gibraltar), the author puts forward a very convincing case: Atlantis, according to Hebert, actually lay in the Indian Ocean, and present-day Socotra, an island off Yemen, is its main remnant. Moreover, argues Hebert, the Atlantean civilization hailed from the Indus Valley, in Northern India. The area is highly seismic and the Atlanteans, like the Yemenis centuries after them, had a vast commercial empire extending into the Mediterranean. Very convincing."
5,Buy only if the price comes down,"Line cord is pretty much a commodity in this day and age. I bought this so I could relocate my base unit across the room from my cable/phone modem. The cable is at least as good as any other line cord I've seen in terms of its construction, reliability, and performance.But I bought my line cord under Amazon Prime for less than $5. Now it's being offered through the Amazon Marketplace for closer to $20. At this price level, it's a very poor deal. You should check out less xpensive alternatives or go to your local big-box store to see what they have in stock."
4,Great for 2 line phones,"I needed a longer cord for my office phone. It took a while to figure out which to order (thank God for Wikipedia). How about a product name like ""Multiple Line Phone Cord""??"
3,Good Oz Story!,"The story begins when a Wicked Magician named Ozwaldo conquers a Munchkin City and creates Mayhem. The Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion and the Tinwoodman come to stop him. Meanwhile, Glinda has her hands full with the former Wicked Witch of the South, Blinkie who has awakened the Sand Serpant and means to conquer all of Oz. Ozwaldo is the only one who knows where the legendary Amber Flute which can put the Serpant back to sleep again is, but can the Scarecrow, Glinda and the others trust him to get it for them? Personally, I think the plot-lines are very good, but I dont think this is one of Donald Abbot's best books. The story got a bit uninteresting as time went by, though the beginning was very good. Anyway, if your a fan of the Oz Books, I think you should get this......Though it may not be the best of Donald Abbot's works...."
5,This is a wonderful series.,I just finished this book last week and it was wonderful. The characters are so real and you come to care so much for them. It was so interesting reading about the Canadian wilderness and about Elizabeth's growing relationship to God.
4,Solid 4 Stars,"This was a good book, intersesting story. The charcters could have used a little more depth, other then that i liked it."
2,Teleplay Quality,"I love plots that deal with hidden Nazi treasures. Yet, I put this book down after 125 pages. Life is too short for characters and narative of this mediocre quality. It is the literary equivalent of a really bad made for TV movie. Some day when I am really desperate for something to read I may go back to it just for the art info."
3,Readable,It is a good page turner and it would make a good T V movie.Its fairly technical re Longitudes and Latitudes I found the plot stretches the imagination. I gave it a 7.5 out of 10.
3,Entertaining,"The Fuhrer's Reserve is a very readable book. Lindsay gives some depth to the main character, FBI Agent Taz Fallon, by giving him emotional issues. The problem is, you still do not really care about him. He is merely an instrument providing a means to an end.The plot is original, and littered with attempted plot twists. What I am trying to say is that I enjoyed reading this book, and I am not upset that I spent my time reading this book, but the plot twists and revelations were as easy to anticipate as sunrise and sunset."
2,Good Premise Poorly Executed,"Of the four Paul Lindsay books this is the weakest. It starts out well with the attempted recovery of a cache of masterpiece paintings stolen by the Nazis in WW2. There is some ingenous linkage with numbers on the frames to the location, but as the plot moves along it becomes more and more ridiculous with the mandatory romantic interest and wild shoot-em-ups. The ending is so preposterous that, unlike one review that said ""it will leave readers gasping"" it left this reader ready to throw up."
1,Rachid Taha - The Definative Collection,"HOW CAN I REVIEW THIS PRODUCT IF I HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET? IT'S BEEN OVER A MONTH SINCE I ORDERED IT, AND I HAVE THIS IN MY ORDER FILE:""September 21, 2007 --- US Carrier notified to pick up package"""
3,Good Pics,"Though it contains very little text information or anything new on the subject, this thin book is full of many different pictures documenting the life of the SS Panzers Division. Good for those looking for pictures from the war and little else."
1,Maximum Strength 3-in-1 Carb Blocker,"I look for a while for all reviews on weight loss product and choose couple one which sound the most honest by writers. This was one of them. I using it for 3 weeks and did not loose even 1/4 of the pound not it helping me with my cravings of fresh bakery product. I am in pretty good shape, just want to loose a few pounds and wear pre-baby cloth again. Absolutely disappointing. More and more thinking that outstanding reviews were from company sale representative and not from real customer as me and you. Think about: You may try and miracle could happen. But I will not spend money on it any more!"
5,Better than I thought,"!!, This really did the trick, gave a little extra push, more energy and when I slipped up i blocked the extra"
2,Meh...,"I'm a person that can go over a week without eating starch, and then eat rice and pasta for three days straight. If you're a person that don't have starch on a regular basis (not a lot of it, just a normal amount) then you won't really notice much of a difference."
1,stomach pains,I tried this and it gave me bad stomach pains so after the 3rd day I stopped using them. I cannot say if they work or not because I couldnt stick it out.
3,carb blocker,"First week felt good but after that felt constipated, So I stop taking it. This product is not right for me. Maybe for somebody else out there will do fine on them."
5,Didn't gain any weight,I went on a cruise after losing about 20 pounds and wanted to enjoy all the food in moderation of course! I didn't gain any weight on vacation but we did do a lot of walking and as I said we did use moderation in our eating
1,Waste of money,"Bought two bottles, what a waste! All they.do is give me gas. You have to choke them down because of the nasty taste. I'll go back to my former brand."
1,Does not work for Atkins,"I've lost 10s of pounds on Atkins and this does not work. I drop back into induction when I choose to go overboard such as during the holidays. I always closely follow my induction progress using Bayer Ketostix. I was right on track according to the strips so I used these before I went to a movie with my kids. I had movie nachos, (chips and cheese), and that's all. It ruined my induction, which I was specifically trying to prevent by buying these. It took me three days to get back into the phase I'd worked so hard to get into. In other words, I was starting from scratch. Everything stalled out. Based on a tool to analyze the absorption of carbs, this failed.KETOSTIX STRIPS 2880 50 EACH"
1,not good,"This was a complete waste of money. It gives you diarrea for days after even when you dont take the pill. I never took more than one a day, not the 2 per meal as suggested on the label."
2,NOT what it claims,"I bought this product under the ""assumption"",that it would ""do"" what it says....I---was completely ""wrong""!!!!Save your money....don't buy this.It's your call...."
4,Another Tool In The Kit - Recommended,"Being a Type II diabetic, I have to be careful to watch the number of carbs in every meal but sometimes it is difficult when eating out at a restaurant or friend's house. These ""Carb Blocker"" pills do make a measurable impact on my blood sugar levels (as measured with my blood glucose testing meter) if I take them before a carb heavy meal, so I know that they work to limit\slow carb absorption. After some experimenting, it is difficult say just how much they help and it seems to vary by the type of carb (i.e. good on breads, not too much help on rice).The recommended dose is two of these gel caps with your meal, but these are huge so most people will likely want to take them one at a time.I liked these enough to order another bottle but, as another reviewer pointed out, I don't have a lot of confidence that using these without a proper diet and exercise program will make much of a difference in weight control.Recommended!CFH"
1,Not surprised,"This ""weight loss"" product does NOT work. As expected, it's some kind of a joke. Four days into using this product, I gained 5 pounds! And that weight gain was while eating sensibly, exercising and using this bogus product.Several years ago, I used a product called ""Carb Block"" and it really worked. I lost 42 pounds using it. Then it was removed from the market. This product can't hold a candle to ""Carb Block""!Save your money, folks. This truly is bogus. Try it if you want to GAIN weight. It really works for that."
5,Maximum Strength Phase 2 Carb Blocker,I like this product. I am glad that I can get it on Amazon. This is another product that is being phased (pun intended) out in my area.
2,Costs too much,"I expected this book to be a rather complete, rigorous treatment of SPICE - with lots of equations describing theory and algorithms used for SPICE simulations. Never happened. It is actually a lower undergraduate-level book of ""hints and tricks."" It costs too much for this type of techie-help product."
1,"Great looking, until they corrode!","I fell for all the hype on the package from the Intermatic/Malibu company. They advertise such a fine product, being manufactured out of ""metal"" (as opposed to ""cheap"" plastic) and offer you a great warranty, but when you read the small print, they don't warrant the finish. Mine came out of the box looking beautiful. Installed them this spring (March), it's now July, they are all corroded. The finish is terrible. It's understandable that there will be water spots from sprinklers, but the metal is actually corroding and the clear coat finish is flaking off. After spending a lot of money on each of these lights, I would have expected much better.Don't buy anything made my Malibu. Go for any other brands made out of aluminum, be it painted or finished. The Malibu brand was very disappointing. I would have given these ""zero"" stars, but the option isn't available."
4,Good for the price,They have done well and have survived a couple winters now. They get a little discolored but for the price they work well with that area of my landscaping.
3,The Desert is Missing Some Rain,"For me, ebtg can not do wrong. Well, except for this dvd. They could have added more of their earlier videos on this dvd. I own what I believe to be their first video compilation, released in the early nineties. This tape included videos for ""When Alèl's Well,"" ""Take Me,"" ""Mine,"" etc... They could have added them all. They've included enough early work, why not complete the series? And how about interviews or a documentary? I was just expecting so much more because I have been waiting so long for this dvd--I have been a fan since they have started.Oh well, don't get me wrong. This dvd is still worth getting. I am now glad to have all of their new videos, it goes along well with my first ebtg video collection.They are one of the best bands ever!!!"
3,Missed opportunity,"This DVD includes some very interesting stuff, such as the live performance footage, and a few select videos from their last couple of releases. Unfortunately that's really all there is. I would have much prefered to wait until they could put together a truly comprehensive package which would logically include many more additional music videos as well as doco/interview footage. Good if you really want to see EBTG in action, but overall a disappointment."
2,Slightly disappointed,"Love finally finding an inside reading rule.But I have a few disappointing points about this one.Both endpieces are the same length.Rules I like to use have dissimilar endpieces one endpiece is 6 inches long and the other is the full 8 inches long. Thus when the 8"" end is open 1 fold it is 14"" end to end. Open the 6"" end, it is 12"" end to end.Opening each fold starting with the 6"" produces 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66 and 72"".With the 8"" produces 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 56, 62, 68 and 72"".Not so with this new rule. Either way you open you get 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67 and 72"".Not the useful measurement dimensions of the different endpieces.Maybe this is made where the metric system rules and it makes no difference on metric rules, but it matters to me, hence my disappointment.The other disappointment is the tightness of the joints. Much too tight, very difficult to use this rule. I don't know what to use to loosen this rule up."
4,Woodworker's ruler,"Take a close look at this ruler. It seem that the ruler is built upside down. But it is not!!! You can lay this ruler flat on a worksurface and the numbers are directly against the workpiece. You can open it to 1', 3' 5' or the whole way to 6'. Try that with a ruler purchased at a home center or local hardware store. It also locks at 90 degrees to mark a stright line accross a board. It is very strong as I have steped on it a few times. I've used similar style wooden rulers for 40 years but this one beats them all. I learned about this style of ruler from an ""old finish"" carpenter who build my parent's housed om the early 50s. I now have 4 friends who would not use any other style. I recommend this ruler over any other wooden ruler you can find. You get your moneys worth out of this item. I would give it 5 stars but the web page would not show 5 stars, 4 was the max."
3,Sorry Mike (Mr. Cruz),"Typically I will buy something simply because of the remixer (even though I may not know the song etc,,,) I got this since I know Mike and expected something more powerful, it is a great song, but no buid up to the vocals, #'s 4,5 and 6 are great though with a build up to a power driven diva anthem (an she normaly has in the past) and # 7 is great if you like NO VOCALS (9;15) min of latin salsa, sounds like they just forgot to put in the lyrics, but it has a great ""ala jennifer Lopez"" latin rhythm, 2 bad no vocals, and it is 2 bad Mike's mix (#3) is very tiresome, after 5 min of the 9:40 remix I'm over it, very monotonous, same beat all through it. It is really 2 bad since this could (and mey be) a great sellng single, in my professional opinion.... well, it's not happening (except for the other mixes) I mentioned jason33305@aol.com prof DJ/jason"
3,Alphabets are good but could have stood for other things.,The alphabet letters were mostly nice but some letters could have been represented better. With its varied culture India in alphabets could have better options.
3,nice for children between 3-5,Nice photos and basic in format. My 2 y.o doesn't love it but does enjoy looking at the pictures.
3,Kinda fun,Very elementary book. Uses some hindi words. Most hilarious example we found was 'S' for 'Sadhu'. How crazy is that!!!
1,Owned for one year - not very happy,"I purchased these cannisters to replace an older set of copper cannisters that had become dented through 17 years of military moves. I love the plastic seals on these cannisters, but the finish is horrible. I have kept them wiped off with a damp cloth, and I dry with a soft dishtowel, but over the year I have owned them, the finish has become more and more faded, spotted, and tarnished. I tried buffing a little spot with a copper cleaner, but the copper finish is so thin that there is literally nothing to buff. The lacquer finish is getting cloudy and the shine is gradually fading. I also bought the tool caddy, which of course is not handled as much as the cannisters are, and it is having the same issues. These are just not worth the money - I would not recommend at all!"
4,"Old Dutch International Gemini Canisters, Set of 4 (Kitchen)",I have bought 2 sets of these canisters. The plastice seal in the cover are tight and keeps the contents dry. Easy to keep clean. I am pleased with the purchase.
3,Nice set of canisters,Bought them for less tha $30.00 good deal! Nice on the outside. But plastic on the inside. All in all I`m happy with the purchase!
4,Zebra Shorts,Cute shorts! But I underestimated the size. I got a small and they are a bit snug. I'd make sure you get them a little big so they fit better! But cute item!
4,Look like someone from LMFAO,"My daughter bought a pair of these colorful zebra print shorts along with a T-shirt that says ""Everyday I'm Shuffling"" for her Halloween costume in 2012. Although she could still wear the shorts now, she hasn't because they're a bit stiff and rough."
3,Soccer in Sun and Shadow,"This is a wonderfully nostalgic group of vignettes and reflections. At times, the writing is quite poignant. This will resonate with long-time soccer (futbol) aficionados, who know the history of the game. Younger readers will be lost in some of the allusions and will not know some of the players."
3,biased but addictive,"This is candy for the soccer enthusiast. Very few public figures tackle the question of sponsorship...what Galeano considers the ""selling out"" of soccer. He makes a strong case, especially in his extended condemnation of the oligarchic structure of FIFA. The questions he raises remain unanswered, however, considering that all sports are ""consumed"" and otherwise would have no way of paying for themselves. The least appealing part of this book is the fact that Galeano (a Uruguayan) focuses exclusively on South American soccer. I do not dispute that most Europeans and North Americans could profit from learning more about the soccer in this region. However, the nature of this book is that of a history of anecdotes, and there are plenty of those to be had in the European theatre that the author ignores. This book should have been titled ""The Anecdotal History of Soccer in South America""."
1,A Bore,"Soccer in the Sun reads more like a story for a young child than a reader looking for a serious futbol tale. Short half page stories fill the book like short articles found in the front of Sports Illustrated. Moreover, the arthur's views on history from the perspective of a socialist were in line with MoveOn.org and trite. Soccer in the Sun's great Amazon reviews confused me because the reader's recomendations of Fever Pitch, Miracle of Castel Di Sangro, Among the Thugs and Captain for Life: And Other Temporary Assignments were spot on."
4,Poetic,If you're looking for a book which explains the history of football this is not it. If you're looking for a book which paints a picture of the game - especially in South America - this is a good read. You'll get a lot more out of this if you actually know the historical context of the greats of the game.
4,Football writing by an actual writer,"This book stands out particularly because of the talent of the writer. It is ostensibly about football (soccer), but it is really about life and the humans who live it, as revealed through ""the beautiful game."" Rarely does writing about football display the poetry seen on the pitch. This book does in spades."
1,Blood is thicker than water.,"Suspecting that her husband had been abusing her son, Marshall Madsion's wife commits suicide, knowing she could not live with the memory, and her children would be taken away from their father. In reality Marshall had been converting his son into a vampire, like himself, and promises to return for Thad. This story is unconvincing, and although a unique idea, Williamson gets too caught up in trying to suprise the reader, and forgets to get on with the story. Williamson takes the easy way out in ending the book, by killing off both Thad and Marshall, leaving the whole story unresolved, with far too many questions left unanswered."
1,No illustrations,"Jay Hambidge is listed as illustrator, but no illustrations are included in the book. I found the book while researching the artist who wrote one of the best books on geometry for artists, The Elements of Dynamic Symmetry."
5,Great fun,"My wife loves murder mysteries, especialy BBC. As her husband I have to admit I enjoyed this set also. We stay away from shows that feature sex and graphic violence as well as swearing. This show was fun to watch. Les"
4,We Got Here Together,We Got Here Together is a picture book written by the son of amazing poet William Stafford. The text and the illustration are rich and beautiful. It is one of my favorite picture books. I wish it wasn't out of print so that I could buy fresh copies as gifts. I have used this book in my classroom for years.
1,Hatchet Job!!,"Even tho' the movies assembled here have a lot to recommend them (Barbara Steele in 2 of the selections: ""Nightmare Castle"" & ""The Ghost"", Vincent Price in ""House on Haunted Hill"") the presentation in laughably bad - and the claim that these are ""remastered"" prints is the scariest thing about this set! You'll see waves and jumps from what appears to be filmed copies of movies from TV and Movie Screens ... at one point in ""Dominique is Dead"" you actually see the frame shift back into sync! Amazing! It almost adds to the experience of watching bad B-movies, but even these are better than average selections and deserve better treatment - unless you want to re-live the days of bad tv reception & grindhouse movie projection from when these movies were first released. If not - BEWARE!"
5,A wonderful cookbook but not for dieters!,"Buy this book and try any of the dishes. People will ask you how to make it! This is a wonderful collection of great-tasting food. The recipe for pecan pie makes the best I've ever tasted, the potato salad is to die for, and the 4-layer banana cake will have people begging for more. Beware, though: this food, while extremely delicious and soul-satisfying, is not consistent with any weight control goals you may have!"
3,Good but lasted less than a year,"I really like this lanyard. It's a good length (non-adjustable), the locking mechanism is secure, and it looks great. The sound quality is decent for earbud-style headphones. My only complaint is that I've had this lanyard for about a year now and recently the R earbud has stopped working. It has developed a short in it -- not sure whether that's my fault but I don't use it for anything other than housework and shopping. I was contemplating buying this again because I was happy with it, but have decided to go withLanyard Headphones for Ipod Nano (black)because it has in-ear style buds. Overall, a good product worth the money just for the convenience alone. Hopefully it will not quit on you like it did for me!"
3,Anthology suffers from the curse of sameness.,"Psyho-paths features across the board (from black humored over to simply pitch black horror noir) stories from many talented and respected writers in the dark fantasy genre. The book does start off well with the hilarious Bloch roast ""Them Bleaks"", but then proceeds to slide rapidly downhill from there. The big problem for me being the core sameness of each story, even if there was a twist it revolved around revealing that one character was, gasp!, a PSYCOPATH! This is a problem that cannot be avoided in theme anthologies and, I believe, how attached you are to the particluar theme dictates just how successful the anthology will be for you in the end. The only other tale that really tickled my fancy was Charles Grant's, which contains the bare bones idea for his road predator novel ""Jackals"". Recommended solely to psycho stories buffs and those hardcore fans that will read anything by the writers they they idolize."
1,Few compared,"Few compared with goods lower than the price is supposed to be in the bottom one more piece to store a large, blank and deep, but of good ore"
2,Not what we expected,"The picture indicated the Spiral lift which gives a good support to the elbow. What we received was a product that gives a mild compression but no real support. If you are looking for a small amount of compression and perhaps added warmth to your elbow, then this product would be fine. The cost was reasonable for what we received. We were disappointed, Primarily because the picture did not match the product."
4,GET THIS GAME!!,"If you are a fan of the movies, you are going to love this game. It is difficult enough to be a chalange, yet the controlls are simple enough to be enjoyable. One of the best boxing sims i have ever played. The unique training mode really makes the game."
3,Average,"This game is not very good, but it is okay. The graphics are good, but the game gets old after you win the extremely short movie mode. Overall this game is average. You are better off getting the victorious boxers game."
4,the eye of the tiger,"i liked rocky very much. i gave it four stars because of the fact that it isn't very hard. i beat it within 6 hours of the first day i got it. but that isn't so bad, because you can do alot of stuff in the game after you beat it. i beat it on novice. you can try on contender and champ. im trying to unlock micky now and the rocky statue. but over all the game is very good. if you are not a die-hard rocky fan like myself i would suggest renting it first. but if you are a die-hard rocky fan than, what are you doing, stop reading this and go buy it!!!!"
3,Rocky....a little rocky,"After taking my kids through the Rocky series, we were pumped to go out and purchase the game. Only a few hours later, my 7 year old son was able to master the game on champion level. All it took was one button. He did not even understand the training menu. He was very under rated at the beginning of each fight and always came out a victor with using 1 button. I was hoping for more of a challenge."
1,THIS GAME WAS POORLY MADE!!,"Rocky himself did not look right, his arms were to short and body was too small, and as for the fighting it was boring,there was not many punches you can do, and the sound effects sucked i was looking forward to this game,and i was very disapointed. i should have designed this game myself because it was missing so much. WASTE OF MONEY"
2,BAD IMAGES,"The images are bad, the way to fight too. This is not a good game, is bored. is better the Super Nintendo Myke Tyson Game in 1990. Don`t waist money. Choose another option."
1,This game is crap,I bought this game which turned out to be rubbish first of all the gameplay is sloppy and horrible the boxers look like apes.THIS COULD BE AS I DONT LIKE OLD GAMES AND DONT WATCH BOXING BUT STILL LIKED KNOCKOUT KINGS AND READY TO RUMBLE.IF YOU CANT PLAY THIS GAME WITH A FRIEND THEN DONT BOTHER GETTING IT.I RENTED THIS GAME FOR 3 NIGHTS AND TOOK IT BACK ON THE FIRST NIGHT AND ASKED FOR MY MONEY BACK.
4,If your child loves Dora...,"My 2 year old daughter loves this toy! We bought it for her last week, and she has played with it every day. There are three modes of play- naming the object in English and Spanish, finding the object, and deductive reasoning (the object is red, there are three of these. I do have two problems with the toy though. I think the taped voice is sometimes difficult to understand, especially for one who is just beginning to understand different words, and the pictures are sometimes difficul to recognize- for example the balloons and the maracas look very similar, and do not accurately represent what these objcts actually look like."
5,My Dora Lover Loves This Toy!!,"I agree with the review by Manhattan Mom stating that some of the pictures are hard to tell what they are, and sometimes the voice is a little hard to understand. That being said, it hasn't deterred my 2-year old daughter at all, and she seems to understand it just fine. She plays with this toy on a daily basis and loves it. She loves the fact that it plays short snippets of the Backpack song and the We Did It song too. Great purchase for us."
3,"Okay, but doesn't seem to hold interest",My daughter likes Dora and we had a Dora party for her 2nd birthday. She was always interested in my son's Blues Clues light up alphabet toy so this toy seemed like it would be a hit. She plays with it a few minutes each day but then abandons it. I think she has trouble because she doesn't recognize the spanish words. My soon to be 5-year-old son has played with it more. She definitely prefers the Dora Floating Island bathtub toy she got. She plays with it both in and out of the bathtub. Perhaps she will get more into it as she gets older and she becomes more familiar with the Spanish words.
3,Holes Classroom Use,"This book has some decent ideas for teaching in the classroom, but lacks good vocabulary activities. This book does not have many comprehension materials to support the novel. Look elsewhere before purchasing this for your classroom.From a fourth grade teacher"
3,Hard to set up,I bought this as a backup if my service provider ADSL modem burned out. It was hard to set up on Embarq of TX and so I bought a Zoom ADSL modem from Best Buy. I would recommend the ZOOM modem instead because it was much easier to set up. However I did finally get the DLink modem to work. I still kept it as a backup. Thanks.
1,Item was apparently defective.,"This item did not work for me. After two calls to technical support, and no success in getting it to work, I was advised that it was a defective unit. I returned it for a refund. I bought another brand and that other router worked fine."
1,D-link is the worst company to deal with !,"I had an intermittant problem with this product, i called d-link,and the software they tried to upload permanently disabled the unit.sorry they told me. ""you need to purchase another one"" Yours is defective""Stay Away From D-Link !"
5,easy setup and works (!!),"Router arrived and hesitant to connect as earlier no-name router and livebox both required calls to customer service and a good investment of time.Took the plunge tonight and Alhamdulillah! with the router going through the auto-configure option I spent 5 minutes and entered only my account name and password and my aDSL connection was up and running.The box comes with a 110 / 240 switching power supply and all necessary cables.Computers, HP photosmart printer, and WiFi box all connected without issues. Since the D-Link router is, well, a router the WiFi router from Linksys is configured to be only a WiFi transmitter. All the WiFi devices connected to the transmitter without issues and have live internet connections.Quite possibly the easiest connection I have had so far (knock on wood), though I realize the work to solve earlier connection issues helped make this one easier.I would highly recommend this router.(Using it with Orange Senegal, 240V power, aDSL v2)"
4,good modem,"Fast easy to install and reliable. It ship and arrived very fast, it had everything I needed in the box, the manual were easy to read and the whole experience was ideal."
4,Works well-Can't complain,"The only problem I've had out of it is having to restart it a couple of times when the connection had been lost. That is the only reason I took away one star. Other than that, it works flawlessly and I like that it has no antenna. I received it in a timely manner and it was in perfect condition."
2,Broke after 6 months,"After 6 months of using the product, it decided not to power on anymore.Wouldn't be writing complaining about this, except for the fact D-Link charges its customers to ship back defective products."
1,Manufacturer knows there are problems,As I write this I have had 3 units which have failed for one reason or another in the past 6 months and am awaiting the delivery of a different model. I was told by D-Link tech support that there have been known problems with this unit for about 1 year. Why it is still on the market would be my question?
3,So-so. might be the product might be the DSL service,"The positive- acts as a modem and 4 port router. Plugs right into the phone line if you have DSL- replaces any modem you have. Works fine, about the same speed as the modem it replaced in my experience.Negative- Hook up on a Mac with AT&T; service was ridiculoulsy complicated and didn't work right. Finally had to plug in an old Windows XP machine to get it to work right. Also, I seem to have to reset it every week or two as performance sags. I don't know if this is because of my DSL service or the router, but overall just a so-so product in my opinion.Also- the first one I got wouldn't work at all. Got a replacement right away from Amazon- worked as described above. Return/ exchange was a breeze."
3,Works,"This is one of the better modems that I have seen out there and used. It was a huge process to set up with AT&T's internet service, but it got done. The only setback is sometimes my internet connection goes out. I don't know if this is just how AT&T is or if it has something to do with the modem but it really gets annoying."
1,Confusing firmware upgrade bricked my modem,"I had some trouble with this modem on CenturyLink. I don't know to this day what exactly the problem was, but I tried to fix it with a firmware update. There are two firmwares available from D-Link. There is no indication which one is the right one for your modem. I picked wrong, and now I have a $60 plastic box that's not even heavy enough to serve as a paperweight. D-Link products used to have an emergency mode with which you can fix that sort of thing, but this one doesn't. There are two help lines, one for pay, and one free. The pay one was closed on Saturday night, and the free one was unable to establish an audible connection with my cell phone. The modem may have worked fine as a modem, but I'll never find out, because after this experience I'm not buying D-Link again. Maybe it's time to give Linksys another chance."
4,tricky setup,"needed to replace dsl modem from att. I finally, after about an hour on the phone with d link support and att, got this one to work. I don't know how anyone could figure out how to get this to work without the phone calls. In the end I figured it out retracing some information from both sources. Note you will need to know your password and log on id for you internet service provider. Now that I have it working it seems to function well. I have it hooked up to a desktop and to a Panasonic veira 46g10 tv. Unlike my old netlink router this one automatically assigned an internet protocol to the tv connection. After a few months will update this review."
3,Qwest Setup and Heat Concern,"The modem now works very well and I am satisfied. I however have two initial concerns. First, as a Qwest internet user, the modem's setup wizard was totally useless. It took some five hours and two calls to Qwest to get it configured (and I consider myself reasonably competent). A second concern relates to its operating temperature. When left horizontal, it can get uncomfortably warm on the bottom (at least warmer than I think it should get). After positioning vertically, it has cooled off. Unfortunately, you'll have to create your own stand since it will not stand vertical by itself."
2,"Cheaply Made, not so ""BIG""","I expected a little more than what I received. While I got it for only a few bucks, it was never worth the $7.99 Original price and getting such a good discount really amounted to getting what I paid for. The unit is only 1"" thick (a detail omitted in the description as I did check out the size before I purchased these) and VERY flimsy. The outer carton is very thin cardboard too. I don't think this will hold up at all to a cat clawing against it. There is no substance to keep it held down, and I would return if it wouldn't cost me more in return freight. It also states on the package that catnip is included - I received none. Don't buy unless you have delicate cats or small kittens- won't last long. Invest in the thicker version."
2,Good fun but awful graphics,This game is fun. there are many wepons cars and areas to explore. What I don't get is why people are saying this game has good graphics. It doesnt. Everything is pink and the sun gets in the way also everything is shakey and blurry and bulidings dissappeare as you walk away.It also gets boring after awhile.Pros-Open-ended-wide selection of cars weapons and missions-good dealCons-GRAPHICS
5,Great Quality ADULT game.,"This game is very inventive, well thought out, etc. The detail and game play is challenging and fun and the fact that you can play out the obligatory missions or just ride around and have fun in the city on either game is a great bonus. However, I must add that this is in no way a game for kids, the level of violence and adult themes (drugs, depicted sex/nudity, etc) are not something I would want my kids to enjoy. It says rated Mature, and believe me people, they mean it! That asside, for those of us in the more Mature Gaming Community, I would highly reccomend this title!<br />Darren"
4,"Great Game, play too much...getting boring...SEQUAL PLEASE","this is great.ok, all there is is the exact same thing as ps2, cept duble packheres the changes-slightly better graphics-signs are easier to read-memory is still a bit rough, but better...example:if you have a bunch of cars bunched up together to stop the police or somethng, when u come back, its gone, because xbox or ps2's memory isnt good enough for that-easier controls (my opinion)-simply the same version as ps2, except it has slight technical changes, only minor"
5,Awesome on almost every aspect,"This game will have you hooked. Not having a PS2 or a $1000+ gaming PC, i waited for this title to hit Xbox. and the wait was well worth it. everyone mentions the better graphics than PS2, but fails to mention that the draw-area has been expanded... meaning if your driving down the wrong side of the road at top speed, a truck won't suddenly pop up in front of you (like i noticed happen on a friend's PS2), it'll be drawn a long way down the road.The Graphics are excellent considering it's on a console and you have these huge cities sitting in memory. Did i mention the load time is FAR less than that of PS2 as well?Basically, if you have an Xbox, this is the version to get."
4,Definitely a Must-Have!,"GTA3 and Vice City are in my opinion the greatest games on X-Box. Everyone should buy them. My favorite things are the music(love Chatterbox & VCPR!) and the graphics. The cars in GTA3 look so slick and shiny you just want to lick them, while the pedestrians say dumb things. I like GTA3 alittle better because its bigger than Vice City, but thats just me."
5,"...and remember kids, cell phones kill.","The best reason to purchase this double package: You can add customizable soundtracks to the list (too bad PS2 users), thanks to the Xbox's hard drive! I can't wait to hear the music of ""Squarepusher"" with this game!! It'll be a riot indeed!"
2,Glitchy but still fun,"Let me start off by saying I have beaten this game to entirety on the PS2. (and I did not own it)For the XBox, I give this game two stars because the controls are not easy to use. (aka not set up like the play station) For instance to target a person you have to cycle to the right until you get to the person on the left. Looking and shooting is also a problem because of predefined controls.There are game glitches. Such as getting stuck on cardboard boxes. If you hit card board box while driving 80 mph it brings you to a dead stop. You cannot save certain cars in the garage, such as the police car. Your character gets stuck in walls way to easy. The Police also seem a little less effective.These are just a few and I only played for 2 hours. I know there are going to be more error. I just did not feel like wasting my time. Find someone who has a PS2 and play it over there.Last time I buy a port for the xbox before reading reviews."
1,good but way to violent,if you dont like violent games then this game is not for you. other than that the game is a prety good bargin i got it because i wanted gta 3 but i got vice city to it is an ok game it is just bloody i would not recomend any one under 18 playing it.
5,STILL GREAT AND AWESOME 9 OUT OF 10,"Before I bought this double pack for my Xbox, I had only played Grand Theft Auto for PSone and Grand Theft Auto III on a friend's PS2. So when I saw that these games were available on Xbox I was very excited because I thought they were exclusive to PS2. I can really see why these games are considered some of the greatest ever made because of their innovation, excellent missions, large level of controversy, and of course the car theft. The graphics however look ugly and there are targeting problems regarding guns. These problems are minor when you really get into these awesome games. So please, buy these games for PS2 or Xbox, and play the games that reinvented the video game industry."
4,She wrong but right,"Ok this game gta3 is crazy! When they came out with the vice city ver. it was even better! But y do we have to wait so long?? now it seems dead. Any way, here r some hints: If u going to attck a gang that doesnt like u, find a rocket luancher and fire away. If u want to kill people but not get cuaght by police (not including helicopter) go to a car (that has a driver in it but its no moving)and hop on the hood. Start shooting away as u drive ontop of the hood. Note: U can get thrown off the hood! One more hint, dont cheat cuase then is u cheat ur a loser! (i cheat 24/7 so what am i saying????) any way, hope u have fun when it comes out! cya!!!!!"
4,awsome game,"This game is so fun that I can't wait until the next gta comes out. You can do everything, you can go in to bars and shoot topless dancers and when you are done with that you can go and get a hokerand screw her and when you are done with your plezure you can kill her and get your money back. This is a must have game."
4,BUY THIS GAME,"In this game you get to kill people with guns, bats, anything you can think of. you do missions and get money after you complete them so you can get more guns and kill more people"
3,Why did we have to wait so long?,"I played GTA 3 on PS2 before getting my Xbox and it was a decent game. A bit overhyped by some gamers and the press, but still a good game for a few minutes. Vice City is more artsy than GTA 3. Anyway, I won't give this a high mark because it came out on the Xbox after two years. This is nothing short of an insult. Of course, if you haven't played either game, it's nice to know you can pick up both for the price of one, even though most other gamers already played it years ago."
1,I HATE THIS GAME!!!!!! ITS SOOOOOOOOOOO VIOLENT!!!!,The ONLY violenz I can take iz 50 Cent & GC. NOT THIS ^&$^#_)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY VIEWTIFUL JOE OR CRASH BANGDICOOT TWOC INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS WACK!
1,its buggy,They shipped this game with known buggs. why get a console if microsoft can't get the games right. Thanks again billdo
4,a little disapionted,"i was expecting better from the xbox. as owner of ps2 versions and a fan of grand theft the reviews i was reading led me to believ this was gonna kick ps2's but and failed. this game doesnt quite measure up to expectations. the streets do turn into water, while doing pizza boy missions game slowed down to load. that wouldve been fine if i was going to another part of the city but just a few blocks away fro the pizza shop.the pedestrians dont talk, tony the main charachter doesnt say anything either.if you have the ps2 get thier version, if not this one isnt as much fun :("
5,Grand X Auto,"Here's my take on the Doublepack which is way overdue, but finely tuned for the XBOX system making the wait seem moot. The PlayStation2 verson lacked the ability to add custom tracks to either game, simply because the Hard Drive doesn't come out until Q1-2004. However, even with the expected arrival of the 40 GB Drive that launches with Final Fantasy XI, GTA owners still won't be able to customize the game for their feel unless an enhanced version is released. Now, you have both games at top-PC quality level (perhaps above -no fiddling with graphics cards and audio cards, just place the DVD-disc in and go) both graphically and in audio. The way these 2 games were meant to look, sound and feel. Load your music, and ride into the cruel streets of Liberty & Vice Cities. Another fine XBOX release and for the price, unbeatable."
5,This game is hot,"Buy it. Quit reading the review, go buy it. I've been playing it for HOURS and want to quit my job so I can play it more. But then the electricity would go out... so I'm limited to 12 hours a day. This game is GREAT. Quick loading, smooth graphics, and better than the PS2 version... buy it. NOW!!!"
4,thankyou,The game was in good shape although it took a lilttle long to receive it from the sender all in all its ok
5,best game on best console,"GTA 3 and Vice City are 2 of my favorite games. I bought Vice City on pc because of the graphics improvement. I am going to buy the double pack because of customizable soundtracks, graphics the PS2 can never have and well its just a damn good game."
4,Fusion Blades,"Overall, these blades are exactly what I expected them to be. Fusion blades. Not trying to state the obvious here. But, that's what I ordered. That's what I got. Service was good. Order took maybe a tad longer than I had hoped. But, they got here in a reasonable amount of time. So, everything seems to be OK! Thanks."
2,Too wordy,"There is some good information, but it is buried amougst stuff you can get for free in the help files."
5,Straight and clear,This book is very well written. The author has found a effective way to align the project management concepts to the MS Project 2003 functionalities by simulating real life situations.
5,Dynamic Scheduling,"This is a MUST read and reference for any serious program manager. It has a wealth of information and ideas, and will surely generate new, useful ideas you can quickly apply to you own needs and experience."
3,4 position recline instead of 5 !!!,I received this chair today. This chair is 4 position recline instead of 5 as this webpage says!This is quite small and short a chair.
5,3 great figures twilghted,"I recieved my sets today in the mail,man thet sure look good in real clean packaging.now everybody and there brother can own the highly sought after twilight frodo.i like the other 2 figures as well.However,the first wave of twilight frodo two towers red packaging,will only go up in value,as collecters are scrambling to find them."
4,Gotta love this set. And Twilight Frodo too!!!,"Just recieved my set today in the mail, and man was I happy. These figures look awesome. Ive always loved the clear figures for some reason. Wonderful looking set and everyone gets the much sought after TW Frodo. AWWWW Sorry scalpers I see the price for Frodo falling fast...HEHE!!! A GREAT BUY!!!"
2,"talented, sort of","well, physically, you can tell this band is good. the singer can sing & scream very well, the guitars are nice & clear, drums fallinto place, etc. the problem is that this band is very, very, very cliche. you can tell what the singer is going to say way ebfore he says it, and the songs have no variety, it's just the standard intro/verse/ chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus/out. So once this band lears how to experiment, and create more interesting and exploratory songs, then they will be good."
4,Money the great,It's nice to be able to get colorful items in larger sizes besides black and blue thanks for everything and don't stop what you doing
3,Less than advertised,"Capacity is only 1600 cc's not the 1800 in the listing. It still works alright, but I could probably use the extra 200cc capacity."
5,Amazing and great!!!,"nice size and waterproof! This product works better than I expected. If your looking for a good bed pad, this is the one."
4,Ivacare reusable bedpads 34x52,"The person I care for is six feet tall with a trach, feeding tube, and uses codom cathers. I wanted to see if the large size pads would help with relief of wrinkles as I was having to use two pads under him One for the head area, and the other for the pelvic area, which created many wrinkles when I turned him. The large size that I bought here are wonderful for what I needed. The only downside in my opinion is that they don't have any fluff, they are thin. Other than that they seem to be made well, I am pleased with the product and of course with Amazons prime two day free shipping. :) I would recommend this product for people who could benefit from them."
5,Blue Bed Pads,This is the second Blue Bed Pad I ordered. I bought one and was so satisfied that I had to buy the second. They are washable and reusable. My wife is bed ridden and these are used to turn her to help prevent bed sores. They are large enough to get a handhold and move her about and turn her. They protect the bed linens and reduce the washing of those items.
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love CHristine Kane. This is yet another wonderful cd from her. If you like folk and humor about everyday life, get this cd. Folk music with a contemporary edge."
3,its cheap,"Pro: it is cheap, and it does the job wellCon: it doesn't fit the screen perfectly, if you are a perfectionist, this item might not be for you. If you just want a screen protector, this is the one."
5,this is really for DS Lite,"This product really fit into the screen of Nintendo DS Lite, just be aware that the upper and the bottom has a different size."
3,ds is ams,it was a very good item totaly worth buying and it was a good price i plan on buying another again in the future.
3,"Serves it's intended purpose, but...","I ordered this for my 6 year old son's DS Lite. He's had it for 2 years and occasionally the screen gets a little dirty, but a pre-moistened lens wipe will clean it and it's fine. I bought these because a friend convinced me that screen protectors were a necessity when it came to kids and electronics. When I received them, they were exactly as described, BUT they were more trouble to put on than they are worth. As long as you keep the DS in a case when not in use, as my son does, these things are pretty much pointless. As I said before, a pre-moistened lens wipe or a microfiber cleaning cloth will keep the screen clean and well maintained and they are MUCH, MUCH, MUCH easier to apply."
1,not the right size,I got this for my Nintendo DS Lite and it was the incorrect size. The length was too short and it was too wide. False advertisement.
3,DS protective covers,This is a pretty good product...a little hard to get on without getting air bubbles underneath the protective covering
1,dont fit,the protectors dont evn fit the screen the are too small for my son's DS so it only protects half the screen no matter how u lay it. first bad experience w/ amazon
3,doesn't fit screen perfectly,"Had to cut down to fit screen, also it seemed to make it harder for my daughter to hit the""buttons""in the game"
2,Not great at protecting,"The screen protector fits perfectly into our old original DS system, however it scratched very easily. After using it for a few days, the screen protector had so many scratches that the images on the screen below it were obscured. It seems to be made of very low quality material. There's really no point in a screen protector that makes it difficult to see the images on the actual screen. I would not recommend buying this."
1,Cheap price = cheap product,"I bought this for my daughter's DS Lite and it is really useless. Upon first application it bubbled a lot. When we tried to fix that by reapplying it, the sticky side (not static as the package states) collected dirt and fingerprints. Also, the 2 pieces are considerably different in size, and neither fit either screen perfectly. One overlapped and the other left a gap around the edge."
5,"Good, inexpensive screen protector","With the advent of the new DSi, the original DS Lite products are becoming more scarce. I found this to be a good screen protector. It was easy to install and adheres well. The plastic is sized just right. It works well with the DS Lite programs. Recommended."
1,Buggy!,"Program will not install, either as an upgrade to 2005 or on a newly-cleaned system. Hangs, cannot be removed. Computer is in an indeterminate state now. I have been a professional programmer for 20 years and a PC user for longer than that. Symantec should be ashamed for releasing this trash on an unsuspecting public."
1,not what advertised,I am not happy with this product. It didn't have the anti-virus that was listed on the ad. I had to go and purchase another edition of Norton System Works to get the anti-virus I needed. I want to return this product - it's useless to me.
3,The Assignment,Because it is an older version of the book but it was intact and still usable got the book in time for what I needed.
1,SCAM,"I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THIS ITEM... I'M EXTREMELY UPSET ABOUT THIS.....I have always ordered items from Amazon and up until this seller, I have received them."
1,Fourth rate tripe,"This is without a doubt the most plodding utterly boring peice of tripe I have ever had the displeasure of reading. Madden's incessant jumping from one name drop to another with no thought of story or backing is painful at best. Rather than form any kind of thoughtful baseball memior, it comes off as pages and pages of ""look who I met one day!"" I would soundly beg anyone with any thought of reading material to bypass this tripe without a second thought."
5,YUMMY!,I love these! They are a great snack and the milk cream inside is very creamy. It's nice to bite into the crunch of the cookie and then get that nice taste of cream inside. These are a very good snack and great to take when traveling!
2,soso,"I bought this sound machine about a year ago. It worked well and didn't have a problem. All of a sudden it stopped working today. Don't bother buying this, spend more money and get something else."
1,Poor Quality,"I walked into a craft store and listened to the sounds on the machine, it sounded very nice, but when I ordered mine and got it home, the volume button was not that great. the sounds repeat very often making this tiring to hear after a few minutes. I wouldn't recommend this. It's actually expensive for what you actually get."
3,A little disappointing,"We have used homemedics sounds machines for more than a decade. Loved the older models! This new one is more compact and easier to travel with, but I find the ocean sound to be less than pleasing. The ocean waves are small and uninspiring and the seagulls sound like there are rats in the attic."
2,Feedback buzz!,"I loved this machine for a couple of nights till is started to buzz. Now it does the opposite of what I want it to and...wakes me up! Gonna have to find other one now I guess, really disappointed."
5,"Relaxing, indeed!","This has been a really awesome machine...it does exactly what it claims! The various settings are fun...I especially like the rainforest sounds. Also, the time settings are really convenient because you just set it and don't have to get up to turn it off."
4,A recent purchase,"You can get this unit at Walmart for only $20. I don't understand why all the online merchants are over charging. The sound quality is sufficient. I find that I have to turn the volume at the highest at all time for best results. At that volume level, you can hear some static noise from the speaker but that seems to blend well with the sound and was not noticeable. 5 out of the 6 sounds are realistic and soothing and help me meditate. I don't like the heart beat sound; I think that is for newborn baby. I have try other machines such as the Tranquil sound machine from brookstone and I found that some of the sounds from such units are not soothing at all (although their sound quality is better). Once again for $20 I think this machine does its job."
1,Don't buy Homedics!!!,"I am required to rate this product, but am not allowed to say ""0 stars,"" or I would. I bought this product and it is cheaply made in China!! Look at the package. I had to return it after only 1 night because the ""natural"" sounds were not only annoying and very UNnatural sounding, but I swear I could hear voices in the background. These voice-like sounds sounded very similar to those that I have heard on tapes and cds I have purposely purchased that contain subliminal messages to boost self-esteem, curb appetite, etc. But, in the case of this product, I have no idea what is being said!! There are plenty of sleep aid products out there with much better quality sounds. Your money could be better spent with those."
3,not a bad little machine,"At first I thought the rain sound was great to sleep to, until I figured out the pattern, then it became a little annoying with the predictable drip drops. The ocean sound has seagulls in it--not exactly relaxing. The heartbeat is a little eerie. The only sound that I found not to be conducive to insomnia is the waterfall. It just sounds like radio static. The little green power on light can be pretty bright at night too. The other night the power went out and when it came back on, the sound setting changed to rainforest birds!!!!!AHHHHHHHHHHH.Overall I don't think it's the best money can buy, but for $17.00 at bed bath and beyond(with store coupon) it's worth a try."
2,Just okay,"I bought this when I was on a trip and needed a second sound machine for my baby. It was okay. It worked fine briefly, but then started randomly going off (and no, I didn't have the timer set!), and there is a crackle, and I have to really mess with the volume button to get it to work. It sounds like it has a short or something. When it is working, my husband found the loops annoying, but it didn't bother me or the children. The other major complaint I have is that if the power blinks off in a thunderstorm or wind storm, this machine, which we normally have set to the waterfall (white noise), comes back to life in the rainforest setting, and we are awakened to the hellish cacaphony of bird calls. That is really a dealbreaker for us! We're trying something different."
3,good at first,This product has wonderful sounds. The issue that I have is that over time the button that turns it on and turns the sound up starts to short out and you have to get creative in order to make it keep working and order a new one all together eventually. We have been through 3 in two years. We keep buying it because it is the only machine we have found that has the exact noise our son needs in order to sleep.
3,Worked Well Till Now,We bought this sound machine 9 months ago when our daughter was born. We've used it approx. 2 hours each day since buying it and it has worked as we intended it: To create a sleep environment for our baby to nap. The only problem is that now it is starting to short out. Nothing is more jarring than a sudden stop to white noise. And sometimes it goes on and off on its own. I'm disappointed that it is failing now and won't be purchasing another HoMedics product.
3,"Good, not great.","I live on a crowded street with rows of attached houses and inconsiderate neighbors who have nothing better to do than constantly sweep, shovel or use the hose between the hours of 1 - 6AM. I like sleeping w/ fresh air when the AC isn't on and thought maybe one of these machines would help. It does help but it's not great. Out of the 6 sounds I only like Rain which does help me sleep better. However, some nights I find myself wondering if it is actually raining and debate on if I should get up and shut the windows. Waterfall is ok and more like white noise. Heartbeat is a waste, the seagulls distract me in Ocean and there is too much going on for me in Summer Night and Rain Forest. I got it for about sixteen bucks at BB&B w/ a coupon so it will do for now but I will eventually replace it with a better machine that offers some sounds that I can tolerate."
1,"Great, when it works","The Sound Spa has some great sounds but it rarely works for any length of time. The first one I got only made a squealing noise so I returned it for another one. The second one worked fine for a few weeks and then it started getting ""staticy"" after a few minutes. Sometimes the sound turned off altogether, only to come on later at a heart attack inducing level sometime during the night. I've completely given up on it now and I'm looking for something better."
3,crickets....,"Nice sounds. although very limited.The sampling of sounds are very LOOPY, and you can often hear the clicks as the loop starts over.The OCEAN WAVES sound is awful, the waves are way too close together and sound more unnerving than relaxing!The WATERFALL sounds more like RAIN.The CRICKETS are a favorite."
2,After 3 months stopped working!,I bought this machine for my baby. It was wonderful at first; however the dial that turns the machine on and adjusts the volume is very touchy. I would have to have it just right in order for it to even work. Eventually it stopped working. I was extremely disappointed that it quit after less than 3 months. It is not worth the money!!!
4,my kids love these!,"My mom bought one of these for my husband a few years ago and we ended up using for our daughter (who was an infant at the time). We now have another baby and bought one for him as well. Both of the older girls (12 and 13) asked for one, so now we have four!"
2,stopped working,"At first, I loved this machine. I slept great listening to the waves. However, right before I would receive a text or call on my cell phone, the sleep machine would make a weird noise. After a few months, the machine suddenly quit working for no reason at all. It was never dropped or damaged. I unscrewed the back of it. There aren't any loose wires; it just will not work."
2,Poor quality,"We've had probably 5 Homedics noise-makers and/or noise-maker / alarm clocks and my wife and I have joked that only one of those products still works without issues. We've probably taken 3 other clocks / noise makers back due to issues over the years. Unfortunately, there aren't many other manufacturers in this price range with these types of products. One thing is consistent with 90% of the Homedics prodcuts we've owned: they break down quickly. So, be prepared to deal with product issues and be prepared there will be a good chance you'll have to replace what you buy sooner than you thought you would."
3,"Quality Issues, But Still a Decent Sound Machine","We have owned 2 of these sound machines for 3.5 years and a third for just under a year. We use two of them in our childrens' bedrooms, and one (a 3.5-year-old-unit) travels with us when we are away on vacation or visiting relatives. The sound quality is pretty good with these units, and the quality of the ambient noises is noticeable (we typically use the Night Time cricket noise).One of our units has a faulty connection between the volume knob and the circuit board inside (not the travel one, believe it or not). I recently opened the unit up and re-soldered the connections on the circuit board, and that has helped performance a lot but not completely eliminated the issue. My brother-in-law has three of these as well and has had to re-solder two.Quality & Consistency of Product Performance = 2 StarAmbient Sound Quality = 4 Star---------------------------My Overall Score = 3 Star"
3,Works great until it breaks,More like 2.5 stars due to tendency to break or poor quality materials/assembly. I purchased 3 of these for my acupuncture clinic. They work great for creating white noise and a sense of privacy for patients. One of these broke after I had it for less than 6 months. The knob has gotten wobbly which seems to make the sound is warlbled - sounds like a bad cell phone connection. Interestingly the one that broke is the one that I use least frequently.
3,"Kind of Bulky, Only 2 usable sounds. All the others have audible loops.",This thing is ok for the price. It is a little on the large size. Most of the sound patterns have audible loops that make them unlistenable. but the general static and rain patterns are ok. Battery life is good for travel.
5,Fabulous sound machine,"I have been running this sound machine in my baby's room almost continuously for 6 months. It can get loud enough to actually block out the loud traffic right outside his bedroom. We use it every day and night. It just started to occasionally short out for a few seconds but then it comes back on. It's a little annoying but not a big deal and considering it runs 24 hrs a day almost, I'd say its holding up. I may just get a second one for backup. If you're looking for good quality and louder volume, this is a great choice. It also puts my husband to sleep like a baby:)"
3,Okay but not great,"Two of the sound options, Rainforest and Ocean, have bird noises in the recordings. When I hear birds, it's daytime, because birds chirp during the day. These two options are useless for sleeping, since they signify to me that it's time to wake up."
2,Breaking after a year,"We liked the sounds, but the knob seems to be breaking after only a year. When we turn the knob sometimes it works, and sometimes we have to turn it off and then turn it back on once or twice more to get it to work. That's disappointing and we need to now buy a new one, and will choose a different brand because of it."
1,Arrived broken,Wow I don't know what to say. I should have read these reviews before I got one because mine arrived completely broken. All it does it make static sounds. How could a product built so poorly be allowed to sell like this? I was really looking forward to it too.
2,I finally give up.,"I have purchased three of these over the course of the last few years. My mother-in-law bought me another. So four total. After four, I am giving up and buying a new product that gets better reviews. Without fail, the sound starts to go bad and then won't work all together. It is beyond frustrating and I am going to shell out some extra money for one that doesn't turn on and off on it's own. If I were you, I would look at another product."
1,TY Classics,Please can you provide more details about the product such as height as it is difficult for the buyer to find out the height without this info. I bought this toy as a gift but I am not happy as I could not get the full details. I guessed about the height but it went wrong.
5,Remote Control Fun,"This train is a wonderful addition to our Geotrax setup. My 2-year-old has been pointing it out in the catalog for some time now. It consists of an engine (3 AAA batteries), a controller (3 AAA batteries) a dome seating car, a dome dining car (the tables are set), a piece of straight rail track and two rail end pieces (ramps).The engine has already been dropped on numerous occasion and is working fine. The simple control is easy to use (my son keeps both of our remote trains running independently).Unlike remote and powered trains for wooden sets, this one works fine in the off position. The wheels turn well for pushing for that hands-on experience.If you have the main set with the controller holder, you can get sound effects from the train.All in all, a very low-cost addition with lots of fun. I personally use rechargeable batteries (never had a problem with them in any toy). It is nice that for once the controller uses AA or AAA and not a 9V."
4,Geo Trax Highland Scenic Lines,A great item. My son loves Geo trax and this train is very hard to find. I am very happy I found it here. My son plays hard with his toys and I know this train will stand the test of time.
3,Geotrax engines lack durability,"Maybe we just got lemons, but my son's first remote train, the oceanside flyer died after about 7 months of use. He was heartbroken and cried all night. A few weeks ago, we broke down and got him this one, and he LOVES it. It worked this morning, and then it died. I tried the batteries, nothing. He does not abuse these trains. He drives them around his track for hours, both by hand and with remote control. I'm almost as sad as he is when he cries ""Can't you fix it, mom?"" DOn't get me wrong, we love the Geotrax, but have had horrible luck with the engines :( We thought maybe the first one died because he would string 5 cars to it, and didn't let him do that with this one, but after only a few weeks, this is crazy!"
3,Ok,"We have a bunch of GeoTrax items and have been really pleased with them. However, this train tends to get stuck on some track pieces, while our other 2 trains don't seem to have a problem on the same pieces. Other than that, it's fine."
4,Geo Highland,"Although the first Highland was malfunctional after a day the replacement we recieved seems to be working fine. My 5 1\2 year old loves the train set and its nice to be able to add to it. my 2 year old daughter joins in and really likes to play with the trains. They are very easy to use and the kids play with them all the time. Its one of those toys you can mix up a little so it keeps their intrest going. We have had the system for about 2 years now and have not even thought about getting rid of it. Unlike some toys that seem to go ""out of play"". The only draw back is that they are big and use a good chunk of storage once you get your collection going."
4,Very nice trains but not perfect...,These are great little trains that have nice detailing and can be used with the remote control or pushed by your child. The remote control is simple to use. They also shut off when not played with after a short period of time. They could be improved by having a reverse function and maybe 2 speeds (high/low) as they are quite slow. I have attached many more cars to the engines and they pull 5 or six with no problems but start to struggle a bit (especially on the elevation tracks) after that.
4,Grandson's favorite toys,"Our grandson's favorite toys are Geo-Trax - so they are delighted whenever their system gets new equipment.I did have to return this product because it ended up being a duplicated gift. But I did keep the other ones I ordered.I especially want to thank you for your system of returning - I used the UPS pick-up and they were very timely and had the new address label all ready when the package was picked up.One thing - the internet cost was $2 more than the store, even with tax included, and I was a bit surprised at that. Also, I would have liked to exchange the returned ones with another locomotive, and that ability wasn't offered. Thanks, K. Olson"
2,Very limited play value,"My daughter was given this toy as a Christmas present at age 2.5. And while it is cute, it only sings a single song and does very little except wobble across the floor. It doesn't lend itself to imaginative play and so is pretty much a one-hit wonder. And that one hit isn't much of a hit. My daughter is a major Dora fan, loves to read (look at) Dora books and watch the show a LOT. But this toy just didn't cut it with her."
2,Dora has too much riding ambition,"We got this for my daughter HAnnah's 2nd birthday. What a cute idea but she is not suited for carpet!!! She is just too top heavy and falls forward or back when on carpet. Her hat also does not stay on, something my daughter wants to her to have on. I wish they would have made her more stable."
2,Okay Toy but Not Great,My daughter received this as a gift and just loved it at first. I can honestly say that she played with it for the first two weeks of receiving it. The only downfall is that the hat kept coming off which was very frustrating for her and after those two weeks she was very bored with it as it does not do much at all. This toy is okay but I would not recommend spending money on it.
3,Cowgirl Dora,My little girl just loves Dora and recieved this as a Christmas gift. This thing eats batteries and when singing you have to take the hat off or she falls over...or the hat falls off. This is pretty frustrating to my daughter and if I would have known it did this I would not have spent the money on it.
2,Not all that!,Disappointing. My daughter received this from her Grandparents for her 2nd Birthday a few weeks ago. She has only played with it a few times. It will not stay up on carpet. Pretty boring.
2,VERY BORING!,I bought this doll for my 3 yr. old daughter who loves Dora. She liked the doll for about a week and then was bored after that. She would get very frustrated because the hat would constantly fall off and Dora would fall backwards at times during the songs. I've began to notice that most of the Dora the Explorer toys don't have very good recommendations. I defenitley wouldn't recommend Dora the cowgirl to anyone.
4,Nice,"This game is pretty bad ass, the trainings are difficult but once you know how to do them you can get your stats up real good, the bruising and blood that doesnt go away is great, and who doesnt like the underdog Rocky.The only problems i have with it are the stamina training (hella hard) and the intro cut scene is actual movie footage but all the others are computer animated (and look ok but ide rather see real movie ones)If you like Rocky movies this game is great, but dont spend more than twenty-fiveon it"
2,winner,"this game is an ""L"" i don't know who said this is better then knock out kings, but there wrong! save your money"
4,battery seems not to last too long,I needed a new battery and this was good price but it seems like it doesnt hold a long charge. Maybe its my settings but kind of dies so fast on battery setting I rarely use it. Just wanted it for emergency but literally lasts less than 4 hours.
5,Class B battery,I thought this was a genuine battery but it isn't. It was not shown on its detailed description. This is used and so far it is holding up. It doesn't look cheap rather looks more genuine. For the price it is a bargain. Only time will tell whether this will perform well or not.
3,Works well but has short life cycle,I have used many of these batteries in an RC transmitter. They are very convenient to use and have good shelf life between charges but the overall life span (number of charge cycles before battery wears out) is not impressive. I really don't see a better alternative on the market however.
2,Beware of this severely edited version!!!!,"Sadly, this wonderful book was poorly edited in a misguided attempt to ""update"" the text. It is still a great reference, but I advise traditional Catholics to find the original text published by the same author under the title ""We and Our Children"". The traditional Latin Mass was explained in beautiful detail in the original version, but in this edition, most of the descriptions were eliminated to make it ""modern"" and match the new Mass from the 1970s. I hope the publisher will reproduce the original, unedited version for those who appreciate the traditional liturgy. I bought both books and one can vividly see how much of our Catholic heritage we have lost when one compares the two editions and sees how much was eliminated."
4,A must read for every Catholic parent with one caution.,"The author has many terrific ideas on how to incorporate a love of God and our faith in the routine of every day life. It's probably best to pick a few ideas one likes and not try and follow absolutely everything the author advises. Because I couldn't help wondering half jokingly if her children aren't in mental wards now as a result of such an upbringing. In my humble opinion, I think she goes a touch overboard. God bless! :)"
5,Stunning,"Occasionally a grouping of great musicians creates a transcendent force of communicative music - and all of the Joe Pass and Ella Fitgerald albums manifest that. The way each of them swing together is perfectly complementary. Joe Pass is ever the complimentary musician to Ella, and Ella puts her heart into every song. Some may say that her prime was when she was younger, singing with the big band and her duets with Louis Armstrong. Bear in mind that I find these sessions stunning. But I believe this simpler, more revealing is one of the greatest display of her musicianship, and the perfect display of all of Joe Pass's skills. His ability to play in such small settings such as this set him apart from almost every other jazz guitarist, and the balance between him and Ella is perfect. In short, I would highly recommend any of the Ella and Joe duet albums to anyone. I doubt any would regret purchasing this album."
5,Perfect for your Christmas lights!,"We just hooked ours up to our Christmas lights and love it. I hate those auto on ""dusk/dawn"" timers because they blip on and off when the light levels aren't quite completely changed. With this, you can guarantee they all come on at the same time and it's so easy to set. I love all the Intermatic mechanical timers and even have their lamp timers throughout my house. I find they are the easiest to use inside and outside the house and the most reliable. I also highly recommend this oneIntermatic, Inc. HB31R All Weather, Outdoor Timer. Heavy Duty-15 Amp. Rain Tight Plastic Case. They both work great, but each might work out better than the other depending on your lighting set-up circumstances."
3,Beautiful to look at,"The downloaded quality of the video is fantastic. The show has gorgeous cinematography and photography. The productions values -- where the actors are concerned, anyway -- a bit dodgy. I got dizzy from everyone stepping around each other to mug to the camera. And they are always talking to each other's shoulders. What is that? Also, how do you not question that fact that you can swim almost as fast as an F-16 flies? I love the swimming with sharks visual pun at the beginning. Also the name of the boat -- ""Quint"" -- brilliant! Robert Shaw's character in JAWS.Everybody is so...so...PRETTY, it makes my eyes bleed. I wish it could have been made into a series -- even a mini-series would have been nice."
3,It's a good game.,This game is fun it's a bit violent for young kids but it was cheap to get and the order arrive fast.
4,fun for older kids,"Good quality, good delivery. Need for mature kids. Not for little kids - too much violence for those who may not realize it is a game. Right price instead of buying in the store new."
4,GTA is awesome,"i strongly disagree with the above review. although most of the missions may be completed in two weeks, if you play the game nonstop, there are still literally thousands of things to do and places to explore that still exist. for instance, there are about 20 different side missions that are in no way related to the plot and are simply fun. this game stays interesting and exciting for way more than two weeks, sorry dude, but you are way off."
5,Best book any teacher read aloud in class,"This book is the best book any teacher has read in class. That's because it's about teachers, and where they come from. This boy Bradley must cross Apple Island and not get caught by the 1000 crabby teachers. Along the way he crosses the world's biggest playground and through the minds where crayons come from. Prince Apple rules the island and I thought that name is a good one. I hope the author writes another book about Apple Island!"
4,Apple Island : Or the Truth About Teachers,"Transferring American children's fiction to English pupils could be fraught with danger but The Truth About Teachers transcends national boundaries. The observational skills which Doug Evans possesses, obviously gleaned from his own experiences as a teacher, work with pupils here in the UK, as few other ""teacher/school"" books have ever done. Teachers and their curious eccentricities, their manic neuroses and their sometimes dark strangeness are depicted brilliantly. Why has this author not been published to a greater fanfare?"
1,I disagree,"This book made no sense. How can a 9 year old kid escape from 1,000 teachers?How can he rescue his intire class?We already know that there are over 2,000 teachers in the USA let alone the world.Teacers do grow older.In my home room last year my teacher had pictures of her younger self.If you like this book you havestrange taste."
3,People who like this book have never been in a military school,"Basic training where you get in formation and march to classes in stepis worse than any crabby teacher I ever had!New myths about teachers may be funny to start, butencouraging students to be rebels is probably bad.Learning is important in our society when change is the order of the day.Here Bradley is a hero for stopping the race of crabby teachersfrom over-running the school system in America.What teacher wouldn't be crabby with the administrators and test giversrunning things and truth and fact taking a back seat todoctrine and discipline? School shouldn't be about brainwashing,but about learning and learning to ask questions.Anyone who encourages people to hate mathematicsshould think twice.I liked the imagination of an Alice in Wonderland teacher's island,but dislike the idea of making fun of teachersand their habits."
5,Cleverest book since Holes.,"Hurrah for Douglas Evans for writing such a funny, clever book. After our teacher finished reading Apple Island to us, we wanted more adventures of Bradley Zimmerman and the crabby teachers. This is the perfect book to read in school, because it pokes fun at school while still treating it with respect. Douglas Evans was once a teacher in our school district, so we know he knows the truth about teachers. Do you know where teachers come from? Read Apple Island!"
4,Conversations with a teacher of intelligence,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to rid yourself of fear and become at peace with yourself and your surroundings? If you have, this is the book for you. Through a series of conversations, J. Krishnamurti gives a breif overview of many of his contraversial beliefs. This is a wonderful introduction to a different world. A world without avarice and malice, but with love and intelligence filling the void of the modern man/woman. This book is a great starting block not only to the works of Krishnamurti, but to a new way of thinking an living."
3,"beautiful, but thickness is unforgiving","I ordered two of these as I have three indoor fireplaces, all of which require a ridiculously long key and one of which is right on top of the brick hearth. This key has too big of a handle and too thick of a shaft to be able to turn on the one where it sits directly on the hearth. The thickness at the other end was too much for it to completely engage in another fireplace. So, I could only use one. I do have an outdoor fireplace under construction that could use the second, so I'm waiting to see if it will work there. These are beautiful, well-constructed keys - just so substantial that it interferes with the function for my high maintenance fireplaces. Hoping not to have to return it."
1,"As a fan of the Walkers for years, this is a dissappointment","I have been a fan of the Walker Brothers since about 1965, and was thrilled when this album came out several years ago. I purchased it and have played it about three times since then. They have not aged well."
1,AAAHHHHH!,"My 5 year old son recieved this as a Christmas present. First of all the pieces kept falling apart. It must not have been tested on 5 year olds (even though it states it covers that age) because there is reading involved. Furthermore, the instruction on how to the play the game are next to impossible to understand even for someone that has a Master's Degree, such as myself. The game doesn't have high appeal to my son because of how slow it is and all that is involved...putting the characters into ""poses"" to show what you want them to do...not much fun!!!"
1,Junk,Ordered for my husband who is a collector of figures. It was fine till he took it out of the package. One arm and one leg broke off right away so he had to superglue them back on. Wasnt going to pay shipping to send it back. Do NOT purchase this junk.
3,NKJV CD Set,"The sound, quality and voice are exellent. The quality of the cd's is sub-standard. You can see the flaws in each disk. One even appears to have sand stuck under the plastic. Every cd has errors and skips or gets stuck. I would not recommend buying this set online unless you like going through the hassle of mailing it back and waiting for a return."
1,Disappointed,"I am a senior and saved in order to buy this bible on cd. At first, I was very happy, as the content and narrator voice is excellent. Then, I began to notice the cds were skipping, then it became worse......like an old broken record, then cd # 35 has nothing at all on it. That's when I stopped listening and started the process of requesting a replacement or refund. This is all such a hassle."
5,Wonderful Product,"The above item was exactly what I had been looking for. I have ordered similiar products from other places and they were not what I thought I wasr ordering. The above item was exactly what i wanted, needed and what I thought I was ordering."
3,Loving the Word of God,I'm very disappointed that these CD's will not play in my portable CD player. Will only play via my DVD player or computer.
5,Christagau's review informs us,"Tenor battle in which two saxmen blow each other's brains out .... live CD-released 2000, recorded 1973. The Baltimore crowd brings out the brawler in both Albert's boy Gene, with his woogie-steeped r&b tendencies, and the famously facile Stitt, known for his eagerness to replicate Bird solos and cut [lousy tracks]in the studio for cash on the barrelhead. The combat is friendly and uncerebral-Stitt pushes Ammons's big gruff Hawkins chops toward modernism as Ammons drives Stitt to a raucous showboat bebop that keeps on churning as tracks approach the quarter-hour mark. Cedar Walton, Sam Jones, and the incomparable Billy Higgins are so fluid you hardly mind when the leaders sit out for a Walton feature, and the 2002 sequel is almost as good even though two Etta Jones vocals intrude. Called Left Bank Encores, it was cut the very same night."
2,Readable but many errors.,"This book is much more readable than the Osborne title, but it has many errors in both the text and the end-of-chapter tests. (text ex. - They can't seem to make up their minds whether they want to use absolute hardware minimums or recommended minimums when giving you hardware requirements) Since I first read the four Core books by the same publisher, I could see where they cut-and-pasted a lot of text from them. The problem there is that they also copied over the same errors they had in the full texts. In addition, at least in the Active Directory section, the Case Studies they copied were out-of-context and didn't include all the data that had been in previous chapters in the full book.It WAS educational to track down the mistakes, though.Overall, I would call this effort a combination of knowledge gaps on the part of the authors and a very poor job of editing and proofreading."
3,Thorough - Sort Of,"I passed the accelerated exam with use of this book and a one-week crunch course to get the hands-on with Win2K. This book throws a ton of stuff at you. Much of it will be familiar to you if you are 4.0 certified. But much will also be very unclear until you see it on a screen. There are some areas that this book covers in terms that are too general, and I'm happy I had a knowledgeable instructor fill in those holes for me. And often the text rambles a bit. I also found it annoying that I had to go to the CD for many of the details - even though I understand this necessity; had the CD's extras all been included in the printed volume, this would likely be a 2000 page book.Exam Tips: If you know this stuff, this is not a hard test. But prepare to have your mental stamina tested by this monster."
1,This could have been a good book...but,"After a quick survey I chose this book as the key to my study plan for 70-240. I'm sorry to say that I failed the exam, and the reason was poor preparation. However this book did play a part in my downfall. The lessons were good, but contained so many mistake and typo's (that were never corrected in the errata) that I became quickly confused. Having the step.by.step on a CD seemed like a good idea, but they were terribly clumsy to use, and without them the book is worthless. The sample test questions also contain errors that are never addressed in the errata, and they bore no resemblence to the real questions."
5,Best book I've found for the 240,"Fantastic. The best 240 book I've read: comprehensive, simple to understand, not littered with irrelevances. I've read many other book where whole chunks of the curriculum have been skipped over or totally ignored, (especially MOC Network Infrastructure) - this fills the gaps. If you read only one book (you're stupid 'cause you'll fail the exam:), but at least make sure it's this one."
3,It works great only when it works (not freezes),"The design and appearance of this player attracted me at the first glance. When I tried it its disc compatibility amaized me! However its frozen(ability), especially for DVD discs, makes me so upset that I only have it for one overnight then I returned it. The picture and sound quality is about average for that price range."
1,Almost a house fire,"I've never written anything on Amazon before, but I had to tonight. This DVD player exploded on us to night. We're not sure what happened but it looks like the battery exploded. The entire living room filled with smoke and a small fire started. Our living room arm chair was blackened and smouldering and our oriental rug was burnt, covered with battery acid and burnt straight through to the flooring below. We were about to use the fire extinguishers when I grabbed a large towel and threw the DVD player battery outside on the concrete patio. It continuted to smoulder, smoke and glow. The air in the house was toxic. This was an extremely dangerous situation, which could have caused even more damage and was potentially life threatening. In short, do not buy this DVD player. I plan on contacting RCA tomorrow morning and informing them about this serious situation."
2,"Great product, except....","This is a great product, but within less than 24 hours after purchasing it, it starting hanging up while watching movies. Very frustrating when you are really into a movie and it stops for two or three seconds to read the disk. May be returning the player soon."
3,Nice coiled cable... bad PC connection,"Just got this to hook my flash to my camera when on a bracket via the camera's PC socket.Excellent length and it's coiled too so that even though it's 5' stretched, it's barely a foot long.However, the PC male end is very loose. I check it against several ports -- camera, various flashes, etc... not a tight connection AT ALL.It was perfectly shaped it appears... just too small with lots of wiggle.I took a tiny screwdriver wedged the two semi-circles apart in order to get it to grip a little better.The cables that came with the original pocket wizards were like this too. The new pocket wizard cables come perfect.Odd."
2,Hard to get it started,"Although this toy is reasonably fun for a two year old, we have a hard time getting it to turn on. We have to smack it against the floor very hard, sometimes several times, to get it to work. This was true the very first time we tried to turn it on after removing the demonstration tab."
2,Ehhhh.....,"Not an awful toy, but not fabulous. We haven't had to bang it on the floor, but my daughter just doesn't seem impressed by it. I think there's not enough of a ""result"" when you find the things, so it doesn't hold her attention."
3,Fun and Easy,"My 2 1/2 year old enjoys this toy. The repetion is the best thing for this age. From watching Dora, she can count to 10 in Spanish and say Gracias and De Nada at the appropriate time. This toy will continue the excitement and enjoyment of learning Spanish phrases."
3,Entertaining,"This toy is fine if your child is a Dora fan. My kids don't play with it very much, but when they do they spend about 5 minutes with it, enough to learn a spanish word or too. The reviewer that said their band button doesn't work - yes I think it's just decorative because our button doesn't work either. It would be better if it was designed to not look like the other functional buttons."
3,Faulty Dial,"Before wrapping this up to give to my neice, I ""played"" with it to make sure everything worked. It did not - the unit would not reconize when the dial on the left was on the 'rock' or the 'bridge'. On the bridge it would only say 'you found the rock'. Then when it would tell you to find the bridge it was impossible. I decided to call FisherPrice and they are now sending me a $20 voucher to use at a retail store. - Simple fix to get my money back, but its the only way to really get something new in time for Christmas."
5,Code Lyoko,My son is a huge fan of Code Lyoko and loves looking for action figures on Amazon. They are so hard to find and impossible to find alone in our state.
5,I luv code lyoko!,"when i 1st saw the show, i didn't understand it. then i watched it some more and i finally understood it. now i watch it 24/7(not literally)."
4,Eddi Reader better than Live !,"I will not write a song by song review of this album because anyone who is thinking of buying this is likely to have heard most tracks at some time another anyway ! This album is just Fantastic, if you have never been to a Eddi Reader concert then i would suggest you buy this album because its the nearest you will get to hearing her in the comfort of your own home ! Her story telling between numbers is awesome, the roots of some Burns material is fantastic and i would not spoil it for anyone who is thinking of buying this album.Just go and buy it ,you will not be dissapointed. R.P. Maung."
3,Plush Rock Dove Bird,The product arrived on time from the seller. In fact faster. My daughter likes it very much.
3,I must break you!!!,Rocky as a game is a great idea but this game is just way too short. The tournament mode is too short and after playing movie mode a couple times it just gets too boring. I completed every mode the first night i had it. Also the self training in movie mode is practically impossible to do unless you have super fast fingers. There should have been an endless career mode where you can win and defend a heavy weight belt practically forever and a create a boxer mode. The graphics were okay. The only good points of Rocky are that you can fight all the opponents from the movies and there are about 30 or more boxers to play with in exhibition mode.I'm still disappointed with this game. Rocky is defintely a game to be rented first.
1,Blackstone's Commentaries,"The work appears to be the 4 volumes of Blackstone, but it has clearly been produced by a scan and has not been checked, so that the text is full of errors and wrong characters. not fit to be published in this state."
4,Silver Creek Secret is no longer a well- kept secret!,"The Silver Creek Secret is no longer a well-kept secret! Fouth graders and all ages will love this book! Readers can identify with the characters and the story-line. Belief in oneself and something beyond oneself is timeless, no matter the age of the reader. Enjoy! and go bake some chocolate chip corn bread!!"
1,A Knock-Off,"Disappointing. I found this book to be a knockoff of Richard A. Joseph's earlier book, ""How To Buy A Business"" (Publ. 1994) - which I recommend over this. This book (Business Buyer's Kit) does appear to have some seemingly original value in the ""Checklist"" appendices at the book's end. Although somewhat simple and limited, they do provide the novice a basis for getting organized and doing research. For my money, Richard A. Joseph's, ""How To Buy A Business"", is a better value."
2,This book will not answer many of your questions.,"I would best describe this book as mostly ""fluff."" This book basically takes a 50,000 ft view of buying a business. In other words, it is very broad and does not give specifics. You might say the reason for this is because the author does not concentrate on buying a business from a specific industry, yet when giving examples he always uses a product based business. Even then the examples are very broad based. And there is little if no mention of a service oriented business.The only reason I give this book a 2 is because of the worksheets at the end. A person looking to buy a business will probably find the worksheets useful, but that is the extent of value this book provides."
4,"good, but some faults","Loved my 330, but the orignal one died after just over a year of use. Had to send it back to Magellan/Thales to have them replace it. Cost me seventy bucks ($70), which was a bit annoying. However, to Mag/Thales credit, when they returned it, they included a bunch of accessories, which was really nice. I guess they had just debuted their new line of Meridian units and had a wharehouse full of old stock to unload. Whatever...I'll take it!The reception of the Magellan 315/330 is much better than my old Garmin eTrex."
2,Not that great,This is not all it promised. There is a whole lot more floor aerobics and very little step aerobics. The muscle toning is beginner level. If you like to step and looking for a challenge this is not the video for you. If you are interested in a low impact workout this video will be a good fit for you.
3,600 episode collection,"We haven't watched all these yet, but so far we have found that one of the dvd's is flawed. Disc 3 is listed as having Gabby Hayes on Side A with Side B having Cowboy G-Men and Frontier Doctor. When we tried to watch Side B, it is also the same shows as Side A - no Cowboy G-Men or Frontier Doctor. We were also disappointed that there were so many episodes of programs we don't care for such as Gabby Hayes and Annie Oakley, and not more episodes of The Rifleman or any of such shows as Rawhide, Cheyenne, Gunsmoke, Big Valley, or other great shows. Some of the better progams in the set have only one or two episodes while the others are on an entire disc or more. For the price, this set is ok, it just needed better variety."
3,Definitive TV Western Collection,"I would have given this a higher rating, but bought this for my husband for Christmas and already one of the DVD's he has played has not worked!"
5,A trip down memory lane,"The Definitive TV Western Collection is a wonderful buy! It is a collection of rare and extremely hard to find TV programs that emulates values that unfortunately, is lost in today's tv programs. True, the collection does not have the more popular western shows, or a lot of episodes of those it does, but, why should it, when these shows are run everyday on cable, dish, or Direct TV.So saddle up, ride the owlhoot trail, come sit by the fire, and take in the stories of yesteryear, where parents are spoken to with respect, the good guys win by taking the high road (and not being worse than the bad guys), and you feel good when the episode is finished!"
3,Good selection of shows - Box broke - Some discs unlabeled,"I bought this item as a gift for my aunt. She is a huge Western buff and this collection offered a number of TV shows that you just don't see anywhere anymore. The 3 stars are for the selection and variety of shows. The first time my aunt opened the wooden ""collector"" box, it split and broke in multiple places. I was able to glue the box back together and added glue to all the seems (which should have been done at the factory). When I returned the box, she informed me that several (I think 6) of the discs had no labeling or other identifying marks. She used a sharpie to mark the contents.If I had purchased this for myself; I would have returned it. My aunt was willing to deal with the flaws.As far as the quality of the DVD's; it is what you would expect from having been pulled from old TV shows. Some are grainy with fair audio, and some are of very good quality video and audio."
3,AutoFolder,"It's easy to set up and doesn't take much space on a worktable. Directions for using could be more detailed. Settings must be ABSOLUTELY PRECISE, or paper folds are not true. Takes some tweaking (nuisance and time consuming!) before the job is ready to go through. Make certain you run some through as tests before putting your final documents in."
3,Not good enough,"Paper folders are a tough product - the ones that really do a good job with different kinds of paper and finish are very expensive and this was my attempt to get by with something not in that upper price range. It did a good job on regular 20# paper with limited ink.. like a simple flyer/mailer but when we needed to do a full bleed tri fold on 28# paper, it just couldnt grab the paper. I blame the finish more than the weight of the paper. But it was easy to operate and adjust - just limited. We ended up buying another machine that is huge and 10 times the price. Not a comparison but just not usable for more than one kind of project"
4,Good deal and good product,"I think this is a very good machine for the money. The only downsides are that I needed my mechanically smart brother to put it together and it took me a few tries to get all of the guides lined up perfectly to produce even folds. Otherwise it does a great job, so much better than our old paper folder!"
3,good as an inflator...,"So the unit is exactly as pictured...it is made of quality materials, brass, chromed steel and a good quality rubber hose.The inflator chuck rotates, a nice feature.My only complaint and it is a big one is that the pressure gauge is very small and very hard to read. With only 2psi increments that are difficult to discern.I tested accuracy against several other gauges I own and it it came up consistently 1-2 psi off, but worse that that...it is HARD TO READNow I need my reading glasses AND a flashlight to read the pressure accurately.It is a very small window to read the pressure (even with built in magnifying glass) and is just frustrating compared to the stick type guage.I recommend as an inflator...but as a gauge no...keep another gauge handy if you want to be accurate."
4,heavy duty,Would have gave it five stars but gauge is not real accurate about 2 psi off. Will stand up to extended use.
5,Very Happy,Works very well. I was happy with the purchase price and free shipping was like the icing on the cake!
5,Love it!,Good quality and accurate product. I have tried to get by with cheap inflator gauges and have wasted time and money. I would recommend this product highly. It does not cost that much more to go first class.
5,Tire gauge - an American classic,"This is the tire gauge that you remember from the 1950's - 1970's at gas stations that didn't have the adjustable tire pumps. Hold the chuck on the valve, read the gauge, and press the leaver to add air to the tire. The scale has a magnifier for out older eyes. Just like the one you remember the man at the gas station using when you were a kid. Ruggedly built, repairable, American made, no batteries to replace. It does require you have an air compressor."
5,Worth every penny,This is a well built and great functioning tire inflator. Filling tires is much quicker when you don't need a separate tool to check pressure.
5,Awesome product - Time Saver,"I use this to pump up my tires on my RV. Before it was a pain, but now it's a breeze. Hit the button your pumping, let the button go you get the pressure reading.This handles high pressures without any trouble at all (110 psi). I bought a second one for the garage I liked it so much."
4,"Quality, works as advertised",Great product. Solid and well built. I like the fact that you can service it if needed. I would recommend this if you want a solid inflator gauge.
5,nice chuck,"A little pricey but I really like this chuck. It's easy to use and should last as long as I do. I wish it was just a little easier to read the guage. But, that's probably got more to do with my eyes than it does the guage."
2,Calibration didn't last,"I have purchased Milton products for years because of the high quality. I have purchased two of these in the last year, and both have calibration issues after 3-4 months of commercial use. I can't say I will pay for another."
2,Gauge didn't work,The pressure gauge only worked once. I really liked the weight and how solid it felt but I can get an inflator for a lot less. I was tempted to order the 501 model but once bitten twice shy. Sure appreciate Amazon and their ease of return policy.
5,Very Happy,"I like this Inflator Guage very much. I remember using one like it at the local gas station when I was a kid. The pressure gauge seems to be very accurate. It's nice to be able to add air to the tire and read the pressure, without having to put the inflator down and use a seperate pressure gauge. The trigger is very handy. You add air with the trigger and when you let up on the trigger, the guage shows the air pressure. If you added to much air, you just need to let up force on the inflator/needle valve and the air will blead out.Very well made and highly recommend. It's only money."
5,Nice gage,"Stury, easy to read dial and I think it is accurate, but have no real way to check. I have a wide varity of tires, from a tractor, motorhome, trailers to small wagon wheels, that often lose pressure and needed a more accurate and simple gage. Adding air and checking with another gage was a pain. I tired other filler gages, but this one is the best and can take a beating."
5,The best!,This is the best air inflator gauge you can buy. Made in America. Solid construction. Reminds me of the old quality tools that are hard to find nowdays. Very accurate gauge and sturdy construction.
3,Inaccurate,"The Milton tire inflator gauge is a solid high quality tool, with one exception. The gauge is inaccurate. The inflator gauge I received consistently reads 4psi higher than my other gauges. I've compared it to two other gagues, both of whom read within 0.5 psi of one another, and this one reads 4 psi high.I attempted to contact Milton through their website to remedy this issue, and received no response.For the price of this inflator gauge, I expect perfection, and this tool falls short. My advice is to go with a cheaper inflator gauge and don't be disappointed by the promise of a superior product."
5,Perfect,"American made, solid tool. Don't waste your money on cheap Chinese garbage like i did, buy this first and keep it forever."
5,Great Tool,"I really like this tire inflator. It is a pleasure to use, especially with my dual wheel RV chassis. I used a separate gauge and inflator before I bought this and now I realize how much better this dual purpose inflator guage is. Highly recommended and a real bargain at the price."
3,Probably a fine product but useless without a compressor,"I don't think the description clearly states this, but be aware that this is not a stand-alone product. The gauge will not work unless you already have a compressor to connect it to."
2,Will not ship to a PO Box.,Will not ship to a PO Box.This is a major inconvenience to the millions of Americans that use a PO Box for convenience and security.The inflator gauge works well. (When I finally got it.)
4,It's a Milton,"This is a great quality - made in the USA tire inflator.The ONLY problem I have found is this model does NOT have a deflate feature, the only was to lower the pressure is to raise the chuck up off the stem slightly to allow the air to leak out."
3,"""OE Style"" not ""OEM""","Bought this to replace a broken drivers side mirror on a 99 Ford Escort ZX2. The important thing to note is that this is NOT AN OEM PART. It fits and does the job but there's a small gap between the top of the mirror and the door. This is covered (and protected from elements) when the door is closed and the rubber stripping from the frame falls over it. However, it's a little worrisome that it's not a flush mount. Overall it's great for the price but I'd still recommend hunting down the OEM part."
4,So far so good,"Mounted on my 2004 Tacoma so our camper wouldn't make the springs sag so much. We are about 20% over GVWR and the airlifts are essential for a balanced load. I keep them at the top of the range most of the time. Installation is a bit more involved than advertised if you want to do it right, but still worth every penny."
4,A Must Have for LOTR fans,These wringwraiths are awesome. They are about 8 inches tall and the pack includes three different ones. They have swords with them and they are really good looking with close attention to details. They are nice for display purposes for a true LOTR action figure collector.
5,Great Even For Young Ones,"I bought these blocks for my twins' first birthday. While they don't yet build with them, they love playing with the blocks and especially emptying the bag they are kept in. They like watching me build as well. They are a great size for small children, they attach and unattach easily, which is great and the fact that they come with a container is what should really sell you on the product. 80 blocks is a nice number to have."
2,ok,its a nice looking knife but the blade is loose also the knife cuts pretty good and the size is a little big
3,good knife,"knife is good, i gave it three stars because i wanted a knife that was just a bit bigger. still a good pocket knife."
4,If GHOST WORLD had actually been funny...,"...it would be like KAMIKAZE GIRLS. Great chemistry between the 2 lead actresses. Great goofy fun, check it out. Some of the subtitling could be more accurate but since it's such a visual film it dosen't harm the movie too much."
4,Defies cliches,"I know there is a collective eye roll by quite a few folks when they hear about yet another movie of an unlikely friendship of two girls who on the surface are different. I am almost rolling my eyes right now because this plot device has been done to death. Please believe me when I say that this story of two very unlikely friends is touching, funny and very believable. It was due to a series of events that I even heard about this movie and my only regret is that I do not know enough about the original source material to understand all of the jokes as well as I could have. But I still enjoyed this movie and I even loaned it out to other people who loved it as well."
5,What a treat!,"Why are the best movies of late, Asian? Ong Bak, Tom Yam Goong and now Kamakazi Girls. This is one funny, insightful and entertaining film. Great art direction, flawless acting, unbeatable costuming and an engaging story. For us gaijin otaku...perfection."
4,Great Movie!,I really enjoyed this movie! I love all the lolita outfits! Momoko looked so beautiful! Would have given it a 5 but I really didn't like Ichigo. Felt like she was trying to hard (meaning her acting). Other wise it was a really entertaining film.
4,good movie,"I love this movie to bits and pieces, the only thing that is wrong is that on the subtitle ever so often there is a first letter missing to a word, but it is noticeable, and you will understand immediately what it means. So Excellent movie!!! :D"
3,Good Research,"Didn't really capture the drama, scope or the effect of the submarine effort to support the Pacific guerillas in my opinion. Would not buy again, donated the book to the library for resale on their annual excess book sale. May be interesting to some, but for me was probably not worth the time to read."
4,love it,I started out to buy this for my 2 year old daughter but I loved it so much I bought one for my 6 yr. old too! They both love them. My 2 year old takes hers every where. I even find myself playing with this doll.
1,doesnt hold up,my 3 year old daughter got this as a birthday present and she loved it but 2 DAYS later she couldnt play with the doll without the gears grinding. making it sound like she was holding the head so it couldnt move. I was about to scold her for doing so then realised she wasnt even holding the doll she was no where near it nothing was stuck in the neck it just is made that badly.
2,"My daughter loves it, I HATE it!","I really liked this toy when we first bought it for a reward toy for my daughter, BUT - it clicks constantly when she plays with it. A loud click that really bugs me. I called fisher price to see if I was doing something wrong and they said it clicks when it spins around. So thanks fisher price for just knowing the problem and doing nothing about it! YEAH!Also, since she wears a backpack on the cartoon, maybe they could've thought to make one to hold the additional parts. DUH!POOR PRODUCT! (but my 2 1/2 year old loves it and doesn't mind the horrible clicking or the fact that we loss the additional parts constantly!)"
1,Disappointed,"We bought this for our daughters birthday and she never has or had any interest in it what so ever and she is a huge Dora fan. She voiced that she wished it didn't have a flat bottom, but that of a regular doll. Waste of money in our opinion."
3,cute but did not work long,"I bought this toy for my daughter's birtday. It only worked for three days after she started playing with it. There is a part on her hand that spins to make the animals move when she sings and it stopped spinning after a few days. At first I thought it just needed batteries, but it still did not spin after I put in new ones. By this time my husband had thrown away the box so I could not return it. The doll still knows who is on her hand and still sings and such. My kids are two and three and they have not played with it since it stopped working."
4,Very cute...,"Little girls will love singing and speaking Spanish with Dora. Cute concept. This was a Christmas gift that we bought from the used options, and there is no way you would know it was used. Geez it had the instructions with it."
1,This toy is a waste of money....do not buy it!,"After opening this toy that Santa brought for my 3 year old (no small feat with the master degree holding packaging engineers securing each and every extremity and accessory piece with a wire), and playing with it for a few minutes, I immediately started to wonder why I couldn't get the toy to say the 30 phrases the box promised. My husband suggested that maybe there is a Spanish mode, but there is no ""Spanish"" button to be found. Additionally, I too thought for the price paid, the manufacturer could have included Dora's backpack to keep her ""friends"" in.As another reviewer stated, I can only get the doll to say 8 phrases unless hola and adios count each as 1, then we're up to 10.Furthermore, the weight of this doll, if launched, will surely break a window, dent a wood floor or cause a concussion in an innocent sibling standing by.It should go without saying that this is going back as it doesn't do what is promised on the package."
4,Cute Toy,"My 2 year old received this as a gift. Six months later she still plays with it frequently. She even calls many of the characters by the Spanish names. Although she hasn't quite gotten into the games, she still enjoys the song. This is a must for any Dora fan."
2,Worked good for a couple months.. then spider broke,"After a couple months of repeated setup and tear-down, the spider that keeps the legs positioned broke. The plastic joints that hold to the struts are surprisingly weak. This tripod would work best in a studio (preferrably on a dolly) where there is minimal setup and tear-down."
3,Good price for decent product,"This tripod is fairly decent when compared to others in its price range. I was looking for something heavy with a decent head for smaller cameras, and this foot the bill. The head is very smooth when doing vertical movments, but a bit tight when panning. The only complaint would be the clamps for the legs. When I used it the first time, one of the clamps broke, when locking it. They are made of cheap pot metal. There are small adjustment screws you can use to make them tighter or looser, as this one was very tight. With a little JB weld, fixed the problem, easier then sending it back."
2,Not a high-performing head,"This is a review of the FM18 head only. The head appears well-built - all-metal and it feels substantial. However, the head moves slightly in one direction when the pan lock knob is tightened, ruining the shot. Spend $100 more (for a Bogen or a Gitzo) and get a much better result."
2,Camera Plate (sled) doesn't fit,"The tripod is a bit heavy, but I knew that going in. Dual handles is cool. Movement of the fluid head is great for this price range. Just one problem. The camera plate (often referred to as the sled) is almost impossible to lock with a camera on it because the metal bracket that the screw on the side tightens (to lock the plate into place) malfunctions. Strangely enough, it's harder to explain than it should be. Lets just say, short of filing the edge of the cameraplate or cutting a new sled tightening screw size, securing the camera in place on the tripod is almost impossible. I have tripods at several ranges above and below this one, but this is the first that fails to function on the most basic level. A pity too, because as I said before the fluid head has great motion and spring."
1,Eye rolling corny/plot went nowhere,"What little plot there was came to no conclusions. Romance was corny, predictable. Wish I wasn't cumpulsed to finish what I started."
1,This can't be the same writer.,"There are two writers named Nalini Singh.This one writes without plot, storyline or substance."
3,Educated worship leaders sharing their opinions,Eggheads each presenting their method of worship as the best. This book was purchased for a FLAME ministry class otherwise I would not have bought it. I found it difficult to read and difficult to retain.There must be better books on this subject out there.Amazon.com surprised me how by quickly it arrived. I had gotten used to it taking six weeks or more to receive an order. I pray this is a happy portent of what is to come.
2,Protestant Disdain for the Sacred Liturgy,"I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who expressed dismay with Rev. Paul Zahl's totally unsympathetic ""defense"" of the liturgical tradition in Christian worship. I was not, however, at all surprised. Rev. Zahl is Dean of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry, the most ultra-evangelical seminary in the US Episcopal Church. Trinity, its faculty and its dean have no use for their own church's catholic, sacramental and liturgical heritage.A much better, fairer account of the liturgical tradition would have been given if a Catholic liturgist like Aidan Kavenaugh had been selected, or an Orthodox scholar like Thomas Hopko. But if only Protestants were welcome, then a high church Episcopalian like Arnold Klukas, Marion Hatchett or J. Robert Wright would have been infinitely preferable to the crypto-Baptist, Rev. Zahl."
3,Not quite what I expected,"Don't let the name of the book fool you. The book only shows you how to make the specific designs of the various gardens in the book. The directions aren't entirely clear and you may get frustrated easily. The book does not show you how to make things like flowers, trees, and other various things you would think to find in a garden. Instead it tells you more about how to make things like the furniture, how to make realistic looking sidewalks, etc. If you want to make a more unusual outdoor setting that isn't flowery or traditional garden looking this is the book for you...."
1,Not at All What I Thought it Would Be!,I rented this movie for my Spanish classes to watch. I was greatly disappointed by the poor quality. It didn't have a main point and in fact was rather random. I still am not completely sure what it is trying to accomplish. I would not recommend it to others who are trying to get a good insight on immigration.
3,I Did Not Purchase This ...,"I did not purchase this so I gave it 3 stars.I purchased ""In His Own Write"" the book from Amazon but not this play.I would not like a book of John Lennons' to be turned into a play. Do not get Me wrong, My son was named John Lennon when He was born in 1981..."
2,this is not a concert!,"Well I know that this is not a full concert, but c'mon 3 song?And the video quality is some parts is not for a blue ray.Waste of money"
2,Vey disappointed,There is only about 40 minutes of real concert. I would like to see this concert re-released in its entirety. Feel cheated
2,"Less talking, more music please","I enjoy Michael Buble's performance, but I don't idolize him so I found the interspersed interviews to be highly annoying. If you are looking for a concert dvd, this is not the one to buy. Unfortunately, it's not possible to select concert footage without the interviews making it a two star dvd for me."
3,Not really a concert,If you think that this is pure concert ( as I did) it's not. This video is a mix of documentary and part tidbits of his concert in NY.
2,Not a concert DVD!,"This s a great DVD to get to know Michael...the man...the employer...his climb to fame through his own words, NOT a concert at Madison Square Garden! A song here, a song there all interrupted by interviews, playing ping pong, horsing around with his crew, etc. I know that I could have read more about this DVD before I bought it, but when a DVD is called ""Michael B. meets Madison Square Garden"", well, I expected Michael singing at Madison SG, not just talking about it. Good documentary, very informative but unfortunately I can't watch it more than once."
3,Don't expect a whole concert,"I bought this disc expecting a concert but instead got a blu ray of the events leading up to the concert with a few concert tracks thrown in. This is a good watch as long as you know what you're expecting. This is not a concert. It does have several songs from the Madison Square Garden concert but it's mostly about the build-up to the concert. If that's what you're expecting, then it's great."
4,that's what I call a complete artist,"Magnificent live show!Good picture, in spite some interview parts with a little picture noise.Very good sound and good music too.This was really a great show yet, too short for my taste ... ""half a dozen"" musics only??!! This show and fans should deserve a little more indeed."
4,Lasted 5 years now has capacitor issue,I bought this TV in September 2007. It is used primarily as a video gaming monitor. the TV has always had a great picture. I have had no problems with it until now. It now takes longer to turn on and clicks 2-3 times before it turns on and sometimes the display is a purple screen with no picture. I called Samsung and they are having a service technician come out to replace the capacitors because they are not the correct voltage. This is a known issue with some models built during that time.
2,Known capacitor issueS,"Appears that I'm not alone on this samsung problem,. My Samsung Lnt-4065fx. It's been almost 4 years, and about a month ago my 40"" Samsung started taking a few seconds to turn on, and now after a month I'm up to about 5 minutes with the clicking and white screens and then prolix attend color screens. After about 5 minutes it finally turn on, but it appears to be getting worse...Is Samsung sending free capacitors? From all the posts here, is seems like a major flaw...[...]"
2,Samsung LNT4065F 40-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV - NOT Reliable,"I get this model Samsung LNT4065F 40"" 1080p LCD HDTV on January 23, 2008. It died after ~8 month, lucky still under manufacture warranty. Samsung fixed for me and now the saga happen again after ~3 years. TV turn on after ~ 2-3 minutes of waiting and sound click on and off, it will die very soon. I don't want to waist few hundred dollars to fix this problem instead of buying new one. Time to change I guest but not SAMSUNG this time. Overall TV is good but not reliable."
2,"Like others, blown capacitors just out of warranty","I purchased this TV in 2007 and was satisfied with it for about a year and a half. I had the power on/off issue and found the solution and repaired the capacitors myself. Samsung used inferior capacitors to handle the load and saved about $1 per TV and sold an inferior and unreliable product.The TV fix lasted, but now I'm getting a line of dead pixels in 2 areas. Chances are I won't buy samsung again."
1,"Bought 2 of them, both lemons, BEWARE!!!","I ordered two of these, one for myself and one for my uncle,(after he saw mine he wanted one) both of them have issues. Mine has a problem when using the service menu to adjust color/contrast etc,.. the pop up windows leave remnants on the screen in the form of pixelated outlines. You cant get rid of them unless you restart the TV. Once you go back into the menus you get the stuck pixels again. The other one has a simpler problem, 3 black horizontal lines that run across the screen permanently.Samsung better check their quality control."
2,Inconsistent Quality,I was initially shipped the wrong model TV. Had to call and schedule a re-delivery and pick-up. Took an extra week and a half.HDMI ports differ in quality. Only the primary HDMI lets my macbook drive a 1900x1080p resolution. HDMI 2 only does 1900x1080i. Using the VGA input gives me a higher quality 1900x1080p resolution. Very inconsistent and disapointing for the price.
1,Broken out of the box,"The TV was delivered in a hurry, not the so-called ""white glove"" that it is made out to be. The TV was ""broken"" out of the box - it had sound but no picture. It was later determined, after many tries, by the Samsung Technical Support that it needed to be returned.We were charged for $42 for return by Amazon for no fault of our own."
5,"Clear picture, easy to set up","We ordered the Samsung after seeing the positive reviews on Amazon and other sites. We also went to a local electronics store to see the picture compared to other LCDs.The TV was delivered earlier than expected and was easy to set up.Note that as with all HDTVs, not just this TV, in order to get the proper perspective on non-HD channels, the actual picture size will be smaller than the screen size. Keep this in mind when ordering and buy the largest screen you can afford/that fits the space. The picture WILL NOT be 40 inches and will not fill the screen on some broadcasts.Overall, very happy."
1,Conked out after just 24 months,"My Samsung LNT4065f has conked out after 24 months. My problem is the same as many of those who have posted on this forum and other forums. First, the TV cycled on and off and would show pink dots on top of the picture. A few days later, it gives a solid screen of lines. This is not what I would expect from a TV that I paid over a thousand bucks for.I'm calling Samsung to fix this. And if all I get is ""tough luck"", then you can be sure that I will never buy Samsung again and actively discourage everyone I know to stay away from a brand that does not care about its customers."
2,beautiful picture; too bad it lasted only three weeks,"The video quality of the tv was amazing. However, the display went black suddenly within three weeks of purchase (no display from any source, no menus, etc). We'll see if Samsung can fix the problem."
4,So good I had to return it.,"I'd seen this TV at an electronics store and bought it from Amazon for $300.00 cheaper. Unfortunately, it looked horrible hooked up to my standard TiVo/DirecTV set up. After doing the research I should've done before buying it, I realized I'd have to invest hundreds of dollars to get the same fantastic picture quality as the one in the store. Fortunately, Amazon has an awesome return policy and I was able to get a full refund. Also, the shipping company they used (Eagle) was equally awesome. They were very professional and easy to deal with. If you have HD cable or satellite, and/or a BlueRay/HD-DVD player, I highly recommend this TV. The sound quality is also very good. If you're a Luddite like me, you may not like the on screen menus, but that's the only fault I can find with this TV."
1,Worked great for an hour,The Samsung LNT4065F picture quality was great for an hour then the picture went out (little lines)...Sound is still good. Samsung customer reps were good and put me in contact with a local repair shop. WHAT A NIGHTMARE! I have been waiting since before Thanksgiving for home repair service. It is now a great paperweight and radio.
3,SAMSUNG BAD SCREEN,"I received my Samsung LNT4065F 40"" 1080p LCD HDTV as prommised, BUT when I installed it and hooked up two inputs, TV & DVD, neither one was any good. Screen looked like someone had painted it with many watercolors. Called Samsung and they had a service tech. take it to the repair shop and replace the screen. It is now back from the shop and works fine."
5,Perfect TV,"I am so glad to have this TV. The picture is perfect. Delivery was fast (It took only 4 days and was delivered on Saturday, the day I've chosen). It fits great into my son's bedroom.I am really happy with LNT4065 so I've ordered one more TV (LNT5265)for my bedroom few days ago.I will recommend Samsung LNT4065 - it just perfect!"
3,"Fast delivery, performance falls short of expectations","Delivery was fast and delivery person unpacked and put set in the designated space.Performance:Does not pick up all stations old set received. Replacing old antenna did not help much and I am planning to add a pre-amp.Great picture when receiving 1080i signal except when there is a lot of movement. For example, a slow pan of a scenic valley is fuzzy but becomes crystal clear when the pan stops. Seems like the the set cannot keep up when a large portion of the picture is changing. 720p and 480i signals result in lower quality pictures that do not fill screen without distortion. Analog signals result in picture quality being worse than on old analog set.Sound is good but not great. Volume equalizer does not work so I am constantly changing volume.Set is slow to respond to remote. Remote is relatively easy to use."
3,Not for gaming!!! But great TV for other purposes.,"I got this TV to be used with my XBOX 360. I was disappointed when I played Call of Duty 4. I wish I knew about the issues with LCDs and fast motion before I bought. You can see blurred graphics when you make fast turns. Same blurs I did not see when the 360 was hooked up to my older HD projection TV. I took the restocking fee hit to return this TV because it was not good for gaming at all. I since bought a plasma Panasonic TH-42PZ700U and in my opinions its the best TV for gaming I've seen. This Samsung TV is great for watching regular TV and slow moving movies, but I think not for gaming. I would bet any LCD TV has this issue. They claim the 120hz TVs are better, but I'm thinking its still not as good as a plasma. I though I should warn people because I read reviews saying it was great for gaming. Those folks must think the blur of graphics is normal when there is fast motion."
3,Lousy Shipping/Customer Service - Great TV,"I purchased my Samsung TV over a month ago and the picture is great and haven't had any problems with it. However, the problems began with Amazon's ordering process. It took me several tries over a week just to get the TV on order. It was listed on the website as in stock when I ordered it and then I'd get an email from Amazon the next day saying they were out of stock and the order was cancelled. Then there were problems with the shipping company (Eagle Global Shipping) and the customer service at Amazon. My TV was delivered to a warehouse 10 miles from my house and sit there for 5 days before they would deliver it to me. I contacted them and Amazon several times but couldn't get anything resolved any sooner. The price for the TV was good but it wasn't worth all the hassel in Amazon's ordering and shipping process."
4,samsung lnt4065,"Very pleased with television, just wished the picture in picture would work with other tv channel. It only works with another source, like a dvd and television channel or a vcr and television channel. Picture looks great, audio is very good, menu options are fairly easy to program."
1,Stay away from this tv,I purchased this Lcd tv one year and six months ago.It will no longer turn on it only clicks for hours.Called Samsung and got the worst customer service available.I paid $1600 for this tv and see that it is down to $850 I see why.Do not buy this tv and I don't know if I will ever buy Samsung again.I ask the customer service person how they would feel paying $1600 for a year and a half tv.He said he understands. Yea right.The only way we can get Samsung to improve is to stop buying their productsJerrySamsung 40 inch model LNT4065F
1,Don't be fooled,This tv lasts just beyond the warranty and then has problems caused by Samsung using faulty capacitors. If that is the only problem my repair after two years will be $85-$90. I expected one of the most expensive things in my house to last a lot longer. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews. They come from people that have had their set less than a year. Very sad and frustrating.
1,Amazon does not follow thru with delivery!,"I should have realized from the previous reviews that ordering an expensive item like a television from a company that makes no effort to coordinate with the delivery company (Eagle) was a bad idea! Our television left Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on June 13th and arrived in Denver on June 20th. It is now June 26th and we live 10 miles from Denver. We have not been contacted. Eagle has no phone number in the book or on the internet. I have emailed Amazon twice and gotten no response. I spoke with their representative by phone today. This representative also refused to give me Eagle's phone number and said Amazon would contact Eagle and email me within a day or two! I have no idea what the TV is like."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM ELECTRONICS-EXPO,"DO NOT purchase from ELECTRONICS EXPO!!! If you purchase a TV on-line make sure that you can return it. Mine Failed right out of the Box, Electronics Expo would not send a new one or take the failed one back. It took Samsung 6 weeks to get around to fixing it. When I contacted Electronincs Expo for assistance, they indicated that the policy was not to replace failed units. For my trouble, (if I removed my bad review),they said that I would be at least refunded my shipping charge (a nice gesture) BUT THEY NEVER DID!!! Hence my review is back... I am NOT happy about being lied to!!!"
1,disappointed,"I did a lot of research and thought this was the way to go. It certainly looked nice when I checked it out at Fry's. Overall, I think the quality with both HDTV and upgraded DVD was disappointing. I played around with all the setting but just couldn't get the sharpness I was expecting with a 1080. There was also several dozen pixels that seemed to be ""out"". The reason I returned it, however, was the the second HDMI input didn't work: anything hooked up to that one flickered on/off and looked serious degraded from a digital standpoint. The other 2 HDMI inputs were fine, but again not as good as I expected. I ordered a 50"" plasma (Samsung 5064), which I expect will be better despite the fact it is not a 1080. The plasma just arrived shattered (!) so I am still trying to successfully buy a flat screen TV from Amazon and Samsung!"
3,Stillllllll waiting at a 2 week mark!,"I am sure this TV is going to be fabulous once we GET IT! It has been 2 weeks since we PURCHASED! Supposed to be here on the 3rd (April) but were now told not until the 5th! Never had any shipping problems (even w/ Free Shipping) via Amazon so this is new & aggravating! If ordering, don't be too eager...you'll drive yourself crazy waiting!:)"
3,be prepared for defective tv's,"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Amazon and I received my tv on the day promised and it was handeled very carefully and the shipper open the tv right there in front of me and checked if the tv worked and all things that came with the tv were there. So, Amazon and the shipper score a cool 100% on their score card.But the biggest downside is the amount of time you wait and then there is a chance that the TV will be defective. It is not fun to find that you tv is not working fine and that now you have to return the prouduct and possibly and probably buy another tv from Bestbuy just because of proxmity. So, just be prepared for such things, and if you have the patience and want to save some money, buy it on Amazon. If you can not stand something like this shop at your local brick and motar store."
1,"TV was defective. After a few days, it did not show a picture.","We were sent what performed as a defective product. The TV worked fine for a few days, then the picture disappeared, and never reappeared. Very, very frustrating. We have requested a replacement TV, but Amazon has not confirmed that a replacement will be sent. If the Amazon response is not accomodating, we will soon request a full refund."
5,Samsung is pure quality,"The BEST picture around by far!If you want an affordable flat screen...then this is it! I have had no problems, but all the praise in the world. A MUST HAVE!"
4,Do you have lines on your screen?,"The Samsung LNT4065F 40"" 1080p LCD HDTV I purchased has superior viewing quality. However, there appears to be two very faint vertical lines approximately 4 inches in from the left and right side of the screen. My perception is that the TV may have been a demo, and was tuned to a ""non-HD"" channel for an extended period of time - thereby burning the two lines right at the ""non-HD"" border. Has anyone else seen this? Is it possible that the TVs Amazon is selling are not ""brand new"" and right off the production line?Any feedback or insight would be greatly appreciated."
1,I thought I was the only unlucky person,"I read all the reviews about this TV before and after I bought mine from Amazon 40 days ago. The TV is getting very good ratings and I had been happy with my TV until yesterday night. The TV suddenly shows only vertical colored thin lines on the screens. I thought I was the only unlucky person with the TV and decided to write a review to warn others, and was surprised to see Peppermint's review. I am not the only unlucky person with the TV now. I called Samsung service center this moring and was also asked to ""reboot"" my TV. It was not working. An at home service is scheduled, but the earliest time is 4 days later. Now I really want to return my TV, but since I bought 40 days ago and it has exceed 30 days' return period. How can I return it? Any suggestion is welcomed.Please think twice before you decide to buy this TV."
4,Amazing picture but not without some issues,"I bought this TV a month ago and was wow from it right out of the box. All channels including SD is pretty good, but watching baseball games in HD and even some 1080p pictures from PS3 was the wow factor. The controls and contrast on this tv is amazing. But after about 3 weeks of use, I started to notice some clouding effects with the black screens. So today I just received my replacement from Amazon, which was one of the easiest and quickest 30 day replacement warranty I've ever experience. I must say buying direct from Amazon itself was a great option and the best price. So now i'm hoping that it was just that one bad unit since everyone else seems to have such great use with their model. Overall if there wasn't the need for replacement I would have given it a 5, but I do give Amazon an easy 5 for their service."
4,A great looking hdtv,"This is a terrific TV and the picture is at the top of the heap. I had spent a lot of time looking at HDTV's side by side and nothing looked better to me, lots that looked worse though! Out the box the settings are just to bright for me, bit of tweaking and its perfect, I think I need another one of these. :o)Couple of things that could be better on the remote, its not very ergonomic and the buttons are tiny for big fingers. Also I don't like that to switch A/V inputs you have to keep hitting the same button to cycle through all of the inputs.. Not that big of a deal as it does skip inputs that don't have signals and for the most part I don't even use the TV remote anymore, I'm using a universal"
5,So far out of this world,All I can say is its the best HDTV I used and evrything about it is goodBlack levels are the blackest I ever sawThe colors are life likeThe overall picture is crisp sharp and very clear.Even old cartoons on HD looks outstanding.Movies look so real.I went for a higher BW HDMI 1.3B cableA 1080p 10bit color 4065F is 10bit and another feature on the tv with the cable now can be in use or notA higher 10.2BW over normal 4.96overall loaded with features and looks better than most.
4,FINALLY!,"After yrs of waiting and 3 lousy ""reunion"" movies,Jaime Somers & Steve Austin are back in their original and best loved roles.I have watched both series while I grew up and it was so nice to see these 2 episodes restored and released on video.A must-have for all Bionic fans!I only gave it 4 stars though because some of the scenes were edited...very disppointing.The original content was there though and Linsday Wagner is a fine actress and made Jaime Somers so much fun to grow up with.I am impatiently waiting for the series in it's entirety to be released along with the other 2 part episode of 6 Mil.Man that brought Jaime back.Get with it Universal!"
4,Bionic Woman Review,"The bionic love story is timeless. I enjoyed the video very much, even though the f/x effects were a little old fashion compared to today's standards. Lindsay Wagner is so great and this video is a definite classic!"
4,Not the original . . .,"I have this video...purchased at a local dealer...and it is NOT, NOT, NOT the full cut of the original two part episodes of ""The Six Million Dollar Man"". This is the SIFI Channels' (for lack of better example) cut or later syndication episodes. And, it's funny to me that this is called ""The Bionic Woman"" when, as we die-hard fans of the two shows would know, these are actually SMDM episodes. Oh well...Lindsay Wagners face probably sells better...Sorry Lee (Majors). And another thing...with the two series having remained in the top ten all through their respective runs, and their continued success even to this day in other countries...why Universal has not seen fit to put both series full and uncut on VHS and DVD?!?"
5,Lindsay Wagner kick A*S in this,she just keeps getting better.she out did Lee in the Bionic shows...her looks is timeless...
1,Disturbing for sexual themes with a minor,"I am a big Piers Anthony fame found I found this book very distasteful. I have to confess up front that I was unable to finish it. I am not a prude and do enjoy well written and appropriate sexual themes in literature. I this book however the female lead/heroine in this series is a 14 year old girl and yet sex and sexual themes are repeatedly brought up. I got very turned off and feared for the very offensive and inappropriate place this series may be going. She is 14 and yet there are repeated references to what a sexy body she has! I hope I am wrong and maybe a lot of negative reaction will persuade Anthony to edit out or change the direction in future installments, but for me this was a huge deal breaker and a no go. It should definitely not be in elementary school libraries or be given to young readers. I am very dissapointed with Anthony and will think twice and fully investigate before I read another of his books."
5,Piers did His Reasearch,I was suicidal. When I read it it was like going into my own thoughts. I don't know if it helped me along the way but if you want to know what someone is thinking when they're suicidal and depressive read the book. Not that it's bad. It' prooves somehow if you really want them to things will work out in the end.
2,Almost a Virtual (Com)Mode,"A plain vanilla, unimaginative tale. I recommend this only for teenagers and not for any one looking for elaborate, complex storylines. The story is basically girl hates world, girl meets boy, girl loses boy, girl and boy try to find each other, girl and boy are captured by a truly nasty person who is bent on domination of all realities. If you are squeamish about blood, you might also want to skip this book or at least skip those parts. I am planning to read the next two installments since I purchased them already. I do like Piers Anthony but this is not aimed at his more mature readers."
3,"Not for me, but not intended to be, either","As a longtime fan of Piers Anthony, I wasn't overly impressed with this book, or the remainder of the series (although I haven't read it all yet, and I do intend to finish it). I didn't feel drawn into the characters, and the story itself didn't enthrall me. However, this may be mainly because I am not the target audience for this series; judging by other reader reviews I have read, adolescent females feel a very strong bond to the lead character, and the book seems to touch thier emotions on a very personal level. I feel this is one of Anthony's strengths, the ability to write very specifically to his audience, and reach them completely, even if this lowers the appeal for others. If you are not an adolescent female, or have not been one, this may not be the book for you. However, it may provide some insight into what motivates and interests today's female youth."
3,Interesting But Sexist,"In general, the plot of this book was rather disjointed and weird. The character of Colene was, although depressing, very realistic. In her relationship with Darius, Colene was searching for the loving father she never had. And her suicidalness was very, almost too, realistic. What I did object to, however, is the way Colene is described. In general, the descriptions of the female characters are rather sexist and perverted."
1,"gag, gag, gag","I eagerly approached this book as my sister, an Anthony fan, had been tooting his praise for some time. This was my first taste. Well, yuck! Does anyone have an antidote? This guy would embarrass a romance novel writer. How anyone would find the pathetic 14 year old, sexually active, suicidal, heroine, Colene, or the sanctimonious hero, Darius, interesting is beyond me. I can't imagine to whom this book is aimed. Certainly it is not for children as hardly a paragraph goes by without mention of sex and/or personal hygiene. Neither is the tone of the book aimed at normal adults. It must be aimed at Anthony fans who may give him a pass. Yuck!"
3,Where's the end?,"I was enthralled at the beginning of this book, the suicide and depression were all too interesting for me to put it down, but then as it progressed the techno talk baffled me and I was looking forward to the end where I hoped the happy ending would be that they reached Darius' home. A struggle for me as it was my first fantasy novel and was bitterly dissapointed that there was no ending, but thats the way it is in a series I guess!!"
5,A creative and absorbing novel,"The pathology of the characters vividly created by the author evoked enough sympathy and investment despite some discomfort with their pain, that this book was very absorbing. It kept me up reading later than I wanted to at night! Some of the characters' interactions brought real laughs, too. Murr created a real world with his descriptions, taking the reader away to it."
2,Laughable Script.,"It's not a comedy but if you don't laugh, you will be wondering why you continued to sit through this till the very end. Errol Flynn carried this film most of the way with his usual charm but even he can't perform lazarus on such a bad written screenplay. Peter Godfrey didn't help either. Perhaps he had fallen asleep while directing this piece. Having said that, it has a great cast of actors and actresses. Lupino is a good actress but I felt she was badly miscast in this film. What a pity though because the idea was good and it had potential."
1,One of Flynn's Worst,"Despite the impassioned tribute to Elisabeth Bergner below, this is not the little heartbreaker's version of this particular story. In this glossy Warners remake, the adorable little gamine is played by Ida Lupino, who scampers about in what has to be her worst performance. This is one of the duds (""Never Say Goodbye"" and ""Cry Wolf"" are the others) that Errol Flynn made in the late forties trying to extend his range, and which instead killed off his career as a major star. Don't even think about buying it."
2,More expensive than the individual seasons,"What's the point of this collection? Buying the twoseasons individually is cheaper, and there appears tobe nothing added."
2,Rubber Drive Wore Out,"We have owned and used this smoothie maker for 2 to 3 months. It has been used on average at least 6 times a week. The only things that have been blended are fruits and occasionally ice.For the most part it performed well over that period until the other day it would not work any more. The rubber drive teeth on the motor have worn out where they won't engage the rubber teeth of the knifes at the bottom of the plastic vase. I've tried to search the manufacturer's website for replacement parts, service or help and have found none.Very disappointed in this products longevity. Our standard blender lasted for years under the same usage. One would think the more specialized a product becomes it would be better suited for the task it was intended for? This product has failed us in that respect."
5,Interesting read,A well presented history of Napoleon. A great book for the history buff. Looks at history in a realistic manner.
1,Allergy Be Gone Has Poor Customer Service!,"I wish I knew how my vacuum cleaner works but I ordered it almost a month ago and I still haven't received it. Customer service at the company, Allergy Be Gone is the WORST I have ever seen, and I do 99% of my shopping on the internet. Amazon is GREAT, but I personally will never order from Allergy Be Gone again!"
1,This book contains dangerously misleading legal information.,"The author claims it is legal to possess legally obtained (store-bought)poppy pods even if one's intent is to manufacture opium from them (he provides the recipe). He is dangerously wrong. Possession with intent to manufacture opium or morphine (which is the principal active ingredient in opium) is a felony under Federal and state statutes, no matter how or from whom the poppy pods are obtained. His misinformation has gotten several people arrested, himself included (he entered into a guilty plea on a related explosives charge). In his own case and at least one other, the defendant's possession of this very book was used as part of the evidence of criminal intent. My advice (I'm a lawyer)is: use the dope recipe if you don't mind flirting with addiction, but make sure this book isn't on your shelf when the police show up."
3,Pictures would have been nice,"As the title says, pictures would have been nice, REAL pictures, to demonstrate just how the garden should look. Also, there could have been more specific information on how to process the latex into a powder, for instance, but no, it goes right into making morphine and distilling off the codeine and other opiate by-products. I got more and better information from several FREE websites."
2,"Some gems, some errors, and some common sense.","Not a bad book on a topic with precious few people writing on it. Interesting anecdotal history and ""facts"". There are some errors, and it not only casts doubt on other information but makes me think that Hogshire wrote down all he ""knew"" about opium on one of his clean days! Not to knock the book entirely, as it has some neat stuff about growing and harvesting, although there it was scanty, too. If Hogshire had more carefully researched some of his ""facts"", his writing on this topic would make a great book."
2,"A little good info, a lot of slanted commentary","Aside from a small amount of information actually related to a ""practical guide,"" this book consists of one-sided, often unrealistic platitudes about opium. What do you make of a book with broad, unsupported conclusive statements like, ""Opium never hurt society?"" The book's lack of balance and obvious sacrifice of the plain truth in the interest of furthering an agenda is reminiscent of anti-drug propoganda. However,the practical information, though scant, is interesting and of some real value."
3,Good history of opium but not worth the money,"This book is a decent overall history of opium use with a bit of the authors two cents thrown in.The aftertitle is very decieving though since a very minute portion of the book is dedicated to telling the reader about the extraction process even though the information is correct.I gave it three stars because the content is good but the opium extraction methods and preparation techniques are widely available on the internet for free so,basically the book is a waste of money for that purpose.Vaults of Erowid and the Lycaeum give all this information with no charge and tons more,save your money folks.Ponder the arcane workings of capitalism..."
3,"Dated, flawed, but a fun read","One thing to keep in mind - this was published in1994 - an age ago in info terms. There's more infoavailable through two minutes on Google than thereis in this book - but there certainly wasn't tenyears ago.It's true that Hogshire is recklessly optimistic aboutthe joys of 'opium' use - actually, what he's talkingabout is poppy tea. However, every bell curve has twoends. There are some who will get hooked with theirfirst mug o' tea - and some who can take it and leaveit alone. Yes, it's possible to sample opium and notget addicted - but frankly, the odds are against it.I gave this book three stars for entertainment value.More complete or accurate information would havewarranted four, at least. But it is an interestingrelic of the days when information like this wasobscure and hard to find."
4,Opium for the Masses,"Excellent book, I think it could've gone more into depth into cultivation, and growing particularly, but I hear theres a second version coming out, so I'll have to get that... other than that, it's an excellent book, by an excellent writer... buy it today!"
1,Pointless,"I finished reading this book only to see if it had a point. It didn't. It is a pointless, meandering collection of of erotic and historical snippets peppered with French phrases. The book seems like the author's brain dump of these collected tidbits that was published without being edited.The description of the book on the cover is completely misleading. A total waste of time and money."
2,Where's my climax?,"This book tended to ramble on a lot about facts that only a devout history buff would care about. I didn't want to finish it because of the overload of history facts. But, I wanted to know how the story ended. I feel a little let down at the end. I spent all this time reading only to find the ending anticlimatic. As much time as I spent going through all those history facts, the author could have given me a little more umph at the end!"
3,"an okay read, though a bit dull","Unlike many reviewers, I didn't buy this book to get a perspective on witchcraft or paganism. I picked it up hoping for a good gothic read, with some creepy plot turns for good measure. What I got was a somewhat dull, and very predictable book. I enjoyed some of the secondary characters, and the descriptions of the French Revolution. However, I did not find Herculine's ""secret"" to be surprising at all, or all the events afterwards. I predicted most of them, and for that I am giving it 3 stars only."
2,"Lush, but went too far","This author is a master of the gothic atmosphere. Book of Shadows is indeed beautifully written. However, I was unable to care at all about Father Louis' history after reading the narrative of his sexual encounter with Herculine. Sexual scenes do not bother me, but these went beyond what I can enjoy. I just offer the opinion that readers should be forewarned that there are erotic passages that may disturb them."
2,terrible dissapointment,"I was really looking forward to curling up with this book, and it started out with promise. I pretty much skimmed the last 200 pages just to get it over with! I rarely give up on a book, but found after a while that I didn't care WHAT happened to the main character! Others were introduced that were unappealing and superfluous to the story--or what was left of one. Though I enjoyed Reese's style, I have no idea what he was trying to say about sex? love?religion? violence? or how it impacted the young heroine. It was a bit self-indulgent. It was clear that Reese did a tremendous amount or research, but the book could have sacrificed some detail for a plot."
1,Ugh,"As someone who has enjoyed both Anne Rice and Caleb Carr (who wrote some nice things about the book), I was looking forward to this read. I wish I had saved my money. Interesting premise, but the characters were boring, and the reader was given no real reason to like or empathise with any of them. None of the characters seemed top have discernable motivation for most of their actions."
1,HORRIBLE,"I AM AT PAGE 400 AND AM NOT GOING TO FINISH. IT APPEARS TO BE THE BEGINNING OF A RICE-LIKE SERIES OF WITCHES (INSTEAD OF VAMPIRES)--WITH HIS OWN CREATION OF ""WITCH"" TRUTHS--LIKE ALL OF THEM DYING FROM BLEEDING TO DEATH. THE WHOLE BOOK IS MOSTLY DISGUSTING BECAUSE I HAVE REALIZED THAT THERE IS NO REASON FOR ANY OF THE STUFF I HAVE JUST READ. NOT THAT IT WAS UNINTERESTING IN PARTS, BUT BECAUSE THERE REALLY IS NO PLOT THERE-JUST ""TINTILLATING"" FANTASY WITH NO BASIS IN SUSPENDING REALITY."
2,300 pages too long,"Big disappointment. I'm tired of authors trying to write these huge ""gothic"" novels like Anne Rice. Stop torturing yourselves and us. This book spent way too much time on background info. a'la Anne Rice. I'm putting this author on my list of do not read."
5,Fascinating and full of Suspense and Intrigue,"This book was one I chose to read on a whim..But it was worth the choice..I find this book fascinating, suspenseful with alot of intrigue and forcing me to savor every word. I love stories that offer many elements to keep the reader interested. Excellent author...you won't be disappointed in this story .."
1,A truely bad book.,I bought this on an emailed recommendation from Amazon. I won't make that mistake twice. This book was boring and contrived. The characters were unsympathetic and pathetic. If the author intended to titillate the reader with the sex scenes he failed. If I was a pre-teen I might have found the sex in it interesting but insead it was just pointless and in the way. I regularly pass books along to friends and donate them to charity. This one went into the trash. This was a monumental waste of my time and I regret the loss of time spent with this book. Where was to book editor on this on? Everyone that wrote positive reviews must be related to the author and didn't know how to tell him it stunk.
1,A Horrible Waste of Time,I enjoy the works of Anne rice. I like dark stories. I did NOT like this story. In fact I couldn't even finish it. I made it halfway through the story and realized that much of what I was reading had nothing to do with story. The dinner scene once they are at the manor was painful. I started skimming paragraphs because most of it was pointless. Characters were repeating themselves and it was like GET ON WITH IT ALREADY. I do see a basis for a good story here. This could have been a great book if the author had taken time to develop an actual plot and not bore the readers with mindless drivel and pointless goings on. I was curled up on the couch and realized it was more work than enjoyment and I slammed the book shut and that was that. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
3,"Dark, decadent and a little too lush?","James Reese has created characters and situations that push you forward through the story, until you realize some questions will never be answered. As in why or did Sebastiana and her companions know to rescue Herculine? Who or what is truly Asmodei and his relationship to Sebastiana? Why couldn't Sebastiana do what in the end seemed a very simple spell (which Louis knew about all along) to release Madeleine? By this time, you know you're being set up for Volume 2. I don't mind a sequel, but too many questions were left unanswered, and as a reader... I was unsatisfied! His descriptions of the people, places, landscapes were wonderful, and then it just dragged. It was a great story, but at the end it didn't deliver what was promised."
3,Dark and Delicious!,"""The Book of Shadows"" is a creepy tale of witchcraft and mayhem, told with a master's talent. The story is deep, dark, and delicious! As a Wiccan practitioner, I found this arcane story to be an excellent read, except...and here I may be the only one who found this to be true...except for the annoying places where names and dates were left out. While realizing this is a plot device designed to add mystery and intrigue to an already beguiling story, it only served to be repetitive and without seeming consistency. I did not understand WHY certain names and dates were ""blanked out"", and others were not. By the time I'd finished the book, I was so irritated by this ploy, I closed the book in disgust. The author might've concentrated more on telling his wonderful story than attempting to lure the reader in such a manner. Hence the rating I've logged."
3,Unexpected twist,"I have to say that I thought this book was well written. For that, I give it 4 stars. The first half was very good. I love historical fiction and this was right up my alley. I thought it was very descriptive and I could envision everything very clearly. And it really held my attention. For that aspect, I also give it 4 stars. But because I don't like to read too much about a book in advance (so as not to ruin any surprises)I had no idea that it was going to take such a strange twist. The second half of the book I thought to be very strange and boring therefore, I had much difficulty finishing it. The 2nd half of the book gets 2 stars so overall I give it a rating of 3 stars. Perhaps in the future I will read the front cover of a book a little more closely!"
1,not worth reading,This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot is weak at best. The book is filled with long sections of useless information that has nothing to do with the story line. This is the author's first novel and hopefully his last. Definately stay away from this one.
3,Not badly written,"I stopped reading at page 477. Its obvious the author did alot of research for this book, and he likes to prove it by throwing in dates and happenings everywhere throughout the book. This book seems to jump around. It doesn't flow well.The missing places and people, such as Q_____ and C____ and Cl____ and Ch____ really got on my nerves. Especially because it seems to be completely random. Alot of places and people are named.My biggest problem w/ this book is that the main character, Herculine, has very little character! She isn't interesting. Too bad Sabastiana isn't the main character. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about her life!"
3,Not for the faint of heart (or stomach),"This book is a fascinating story and well written... but graphic to an extreme in parts. Having a weak stomach, I occasionally would have to put the book down because I was so nauseous. It also has nothing to do with witchcraft in any factual sense of the word. It is a horror story with sprinklings of bizarre sex, so if that's what you're looking for then I would definitely recommend it. If you're looking for a romance or witchy type book... look elsewhere."
5,Simply could NOT put this book down...,"I bought ""The Book of Shadows"" on a layover from LAX to Australia and I devoured the book on the long trip across the Pacific. Here were some (finally!) interesting characters whose journey through the novel's twists and turns kept me glued to each chapter. Though I'm not normally a fan of the ""gothic genre"", I was seduced by Mr. Reese's sophisticated attention to spinning a heady tale of the spellbinding world of Herculine and her cohorts. Hmm...maybe I should take up witchcraft? Better yet, I'll wait for the next novel...and there had better be one...can't wait!"
5,"Challenging, provocative, brilliantly well-written...","If you want to be transported to another time and place(17th century and Revolutionary France), seeing, feeling and experiencing bizarre and unimaginable (but all too historically real) events through a heroine/narrator unlike any other in fiction these days (meet Herculine and you'll not soon forget her)...if you want a book that is really hard to put down and that you wish hadn't ended...read The Book of Shadows. Challenging, provocative, brilliantly well-written, this is a novel that came to life for me --"
5,Wonderful Suspenseful story,"This story is very wonderfully suspenseful, mysterious,strange. I love this book and it's fun to read! I wish this book can be made into movie. If someone out there will make this into movie I would love to watch it!"
2,Review from a Lit. Prof.,"I rarely write this sort of review -- only when a book's weaknesses so strongly motivate me. What promise this book initially had. What potential. But so little promise and potential realized. Good characters, but dragging plot when the plot could be found. I read abundantly in a variety of fields, especially in gothic/horror literature. This author needs to get back to basic story-telling. Sorry.... This novel would make my ""worst reads"" list."
1,Awful. Just awful.,"I'm halfway through the book (page 230), and they still haven't gotten to the point of why Herculine was ""chosen"" or what special favor the incubus and succubus need to ask of her. There's some interesting background on the Inquisition and the witch burnings, and then the author throws in some hermaphrodite sex (ridiculous). I can't force myself to endure this book any longer."
3,Too many flashbacks...,"Like others, I had a hard time with this book. Its meandering from one thing to the next threw me off. The sheer amount of characters in this book waters down the whole thing and makes it into a chore. I made it to page 236 and decided to take the book back to the library. While the author is intelligent and has a unique and detailed writing style, it was too in-depth--too pondering. I just couldn't finish it. I hate it when I start reading a book and it's anquish to finish. I would rather remember Herculine as she is at page 236 than struggle through the rest. Not so much windbag and more character development would've been nice. Just when you get to know the shallow characters new ones are introduced and you have to read chapter upon chapter explaining their background. Gah, the bore!"
5,A gorgeous piece of fiction.,"This is the kind of novel that takes its rightful place in the tradition of history's great gothic works. The writing is first rate and the characters are stunningly brought to life. Prepare to put your life on hold as you pour over this delicious feast of a book. Those who thought the book ""plodding"" can just go an eat your little Danielle Steele booksnacks and leave the true novels to those of us who appreciate them."
3,Enjoyable erotic passages,"One could split the book in two parts. Part one is about a nun trying to live in a very stern religious community. Quite realistic and believably written. In the second part the main character is suddenly surrounded by witches, demons and other ghosts. One hundred pages of realism doesn't justify the other three hundred. Just one ghost or witch would have been enough. Also there are too many storylines going nowhere. The main storyline is just clumsy at times. Another reviewer mentioned Anne Rice. I had her in mind too while reading. The elegant tone of the writing is very similar, yet this story misses a strong sense of realism. Which is, to my opinion, Rice's great contribution to vampire fiction."
3,Half and half- (beware- minor spoilers),"The book has an original voice and an original concept. The plot often shocks, and the imagery is often gruesome as well as sensual and sometimes both at once.However, the prose is long winded and can dive into the tedious at any turn. I found that the first half of the book- until Hurculine is saved and goes to Sebastiana's manor- is quite good and exciting, but then the author dives into flashback stories of the histories of characters we really don't care about, for no reason. The second half of the book is very boring and the ending is anti-climactic.Still, I enjoyed the book for it's originality and the voice of a new and promising author. It IS worth reading."
1,Seriously?!?!????,"How can this book claim to help you avoid huge ships when there is no chapter dedicated to avoiding a transitting aircraft carrier when you are swimming across the Suez Canal? In addition, there is absolutely no mention of how to get your fishing dhow out of the path of a carrier while it makes its own wind in the Persian Gulf. Ridiculous. These are clearly gaping holes in the Captain's research and grasp of this vital topic. Tragic."
1,What's the problem?,"I experimented with huge ships when I was younger, and I don't understand why Mr. Trimmer wrote this book, except maybe to make a lot of money. I mean, huge ship experimentation didn't do me any harm at all, except for a minor head injury, and that was OK because I married my occupational therapist. At least, that's what I remember, but it was a long time ago. But really I'm fine now. Anyway, hey, you wanna see my dinghy?"
1,Too little too late,"Scogli delle Scole here, the shoal east of Giglio Island. One of my fellow rocks suggested I read through the informative guide. I was all cocky - why would I ever need that information? Well, that was before Costa Concordia. #$%^ing cruise ships."
5,Brilliant and mysterious!,"Although I have not read the book in it's entirety I have read enough blurbs to conclude that I would gain so much if I had the opportunity to read the whole book. I am so discouraged, however, by how difficult it has been to find this book for a decent price. The knowledge this book holds should be available to everyone for FREE. LIFE SAVING! I always thought I was alone in my issue of, what I know now is called ""Huge Ship Avoidance Syndrome"" or HSAS. Years of therapy and the knowledge of this book's existence have finally shown me that I am not the only one that is afraid of a ship run in and this whole book is dedicated to my issue. I have read ""How to Avoid Small ships"" and ""How to Avoid Medium Sized Ships"" but to no avail. This book holds the key to my ""Huge Ship Avoidance"". I need a copy of this elusive masterpiece!"
1,Got me a woman,"Ideal present for a woman on a first date. Honestly. (I'd read it and actually the fact that he has no sense of humour backs him into comic at times.) Living in almost the farthest place in England from the sea, the chance of running into a huge ship was, let us say, unlikely."
1,"Oh... It says SHIPS? Not what I thought it was, thankful for Amazon's return policy","Ok, this book was not what I thought it was. I have a serious problem. There isn't a toilet under the sun that I can't clog up. Kohler, Toto, American Standard, Gerber; none of them are a match for me. So after giving up on finding the perfect toilet that could receive my magnanimity with gratitude, I decided to look for a more personal solution. So I googled, ""How to Avoid Huge S***s"" hoping to find a way to better eating habits.Unfortunately, when I came across this title I was so excited that someone had written a book just for me, that I ordered it without further reading. You can discover my dismay upon learning how useless this book was. To make matters worth, the paper was glossy and not even absorbent.Good thing Amazon will take anything back. Sorry to whoever eventually ends up with my copy."
4,Will it work for large wooden badgers?,"Bravo to Cpt. Trimmer for his excellent and thought-provoking tactics! Living in the middle of the US, I've taken it to heart and have yet to encounter a huge ship. In addition, I'm considering using those tactics to avoid the large wooden rabbit which has taken up residence just outside my gate.........perhaps just as soon as my Norwegian Blue Parrot wakes from his extended rest. Well-played Cpt. trimmer! Regards, pansy"
5,Great read! Can't wait to see the movie!,Wow! What a read! I can't wait to see the movie. I understand Tom Cruise has signed on to play one of the ships.
3,Too late for some- such a tragedy,"In younger days, I worked on a tanker plying the coastal waters of the Mid-Atlantic. On a morning watch, there was a disturbance as the crew found wreckage of a sailing mast and radar equipment fouled in the hawse-hole at the bow of the ship.Such a tragedy, as whoever was in charge of that boat sure could have used this book. A few decades too late."
2,Hard to put into practice,"I have read this book three times and I am still running into HUGE ships. I feel like I understand the concepts detailed in the book, but seem not to be able to apply them while on the water."
3,"Valuable, but Dangerously Circumspect","This book warns the public about the dangers of huge ships. It shows how to avoid them. Check.But it fails utterly in providing analogous warnings about the dangers of *moderately* large ships. Case in point: I had a friend, a kind, world-weary, old-soul sort of fellow, who learned from this book how to avoid -- as the title tells us -- huge ships. Maybe this saved his life; we can't know. But, one day, when assiduously, actively, engagedly avoiding said huge ships, one that was merely VERY LARGE sideswiped him off the island of Corfu, permanently chipping his fourth vertebra and ending his childhood dream of being a contortionist.Perhaps if the book widened its scandalously slender focus on only the largest seafaring vessels, my friend would be on the Carson show now. I mean, if the Carson show were still on."
2,A bit outdated.,"While scientifically accurate, the book is a little long-winded in delivering information that, these days, can be considered common sense. I mean, with the average citizen having a near-daily encounter with huge ships, I think even a first-grader can tell you that huge ships have a poor sense of smell and that ""playing dead"" is a fail-safe approach in virtually all situations. Trivial, really."
1,How to Avoid Huge Ships,"I liked the animation in Life of Pi, so I bought this book. It is nothing like the movie. Where are the animals?"
1,Destroying my business,I make a living by hitting things with my Huge Ship. This book is absolutely DESTROYING my business! Please do not buy this!
5,A Great Metaphor for the Lessons of Life,"I bought this book as a joke while attending a government management seminar at the Maritime Institute of Technology (located in Baltimore Md). I remember thinking to myself ""you know life is tough, but it is even tougher when your stupid"". Here is a book written by an old captain who is tired of running over fools in their pleasure boats, and wants to educate those same fools in a futile effort to save their lives. One can almost imagine a sequel written by a train engineer ""How to Avoid Parking on Train Tracks"". At any rate for several years now this book has graced by desk, and has served as an inspiration for more conversations than any other book I have ever owned. Remember as you go through life you need to keep a lookout for the huge juggernauts that can really ruin your day."
1,How to avoid this book!,Stumbled across this while looking for books on how to attract huge ships. This book is awful and vaguely racist.
2,This book doesn't work,"Color me disappointed. I admit that after reading ""How to Avoid Huge Ships,"" I've had no issues whatsoever with tankers in the 320,000 DWT and over class. But this book has provided absolutely *no* protection from ships between 80,000 and 160,000 DWT. While I realize vessels of this size may constitute ""large"" in some maritime parlance, I'm here to tell you from bitter experience that if you're run down by one of these behemoths, they seem plenty huge enough. I urge Captain Trimmer to be more specific in the titling of future books regarding substantial watercraft."
3,Close call!,"I had booked a two week cruise to Mexico, and was getting everything ready until, someone bought this book for me. Needless to say i did NOT end up embarking on my cruise. Thank you HTALS!"
2,Not applicable to Iowa,"While Captain Trammer's monograph ""How to Avoid Huge Ships"" has received glowing reviews, out here in Iowa the huge ships we must avoid are the Crown Victoria, Caprice Classic, Dodge Charger Pursuit and the occasional Hummer H2. Should the author publish an updated edition covering these land vessel hazards I might consider buying it. Until then, I plan to hold off and keep my money in the bank."
2,Terrible Series,"After reading Captain Trimmer's ""How to avoid the Letter 'E'"", I decided to follow it up with the sequel. I expected to learn all about avoiding Hug Ships, but alas, the inside was not about Hug Ships at all. Very disappointing series of books."
3,disappointing,"I'm somewhat dyslexic and irregular. I bought this book from a bookstore thinking it might be a self-help book I could use. When I realized my mistake, I tried to return it. The bookstore refused to accept is as apparently they could tell that it had been read in a bathroom. The clerk handed it back to me holding it with a tissue."
3,Don't tunnel vision yourself to destruction.,"While this book has many good points, I must warn the uninitiated reader not to get too tunnel visioned. While I was successfully avoiding a big ship, I was blindsided by The USS Minnow on a three-hour tour. Buyer beware."
1,Overpriced,"I found the price tag to be a little steep for this. When I was a kid, we went swimming and my mom told me, ""Watch out for huge ships. I mean really keep your eyes open, okay?"". I've used that method to avoid huge ships ever since, and I've yet to be surprised while water sporting. It even works on smaller ships, canoes, and driftwood. So I kinda feel like this book is overpriced, considering my mom's advice about has it covered."
2,Serious Business! Stop with the Jokes!,"So I guess you're all having fun with these reviews. Well it was not funny when in the winter of 1972 my father had to stop in the middle of the road because a huge ship had just crossed our path as we came home from a family visit. We had always heard the rumors of the big ships, but like everyone else we thought it was just over active imaginations. The stuff of legends. Well it still might be myth, and oh so funny to many of you, but that night my father was abducted by a huge ship, and we never saw him again. Imagine the pain we feel when we are forced to travel to a port city or see a news story about a huge ship! Would you laugh if it was your father? That is what I thought. Good day!PS: I did think the chapter on bilge pumps was funny an informative,thus the extra star."
3,Lacking essential information,"This book lacks criteria for discerning between huge ships and merely really big ships. Some well-designed lists, charts or colorful pop-up sections would have been nice for readers who were unsure what size of ship they were avoiding."
5,HELPED SOOO MUCH!!!,"This is book is defenitly worth reading! I RECOMMEND THIS TO PEOPLE OF ALL AGES!!! After getting run over 24 and a half times I realized my major mistake was instead of turning the other way when seeing a huge object many miles away, I decided to wait there and the weird part was that the ship ran over me! I didn't understand what was happening until I read this book! Thank you so much captain!"
2,Real easy way,"Stay your ass out of the ocean, stupid! That will do real good. Unless you are at risk from land ships as well."
3,The second attempt,For those of you who are interested in purchasing this book I want to encourage you to get your hands on the first edition. The first edition is MUCH better.
5,Worth a chest o' doubloons,"Arrr! Been finding meself in many a tight spot o' bother on the high seas and nearly entered Davey Jones' Locker more times than meself would like to remember, but thanks to this excellent fire in the hole I've been handsomely navigatin' me man-o-war to all the ports o' call in me fancy. Take it from an old salt like meself, this book is worth as much as a letter o' marque signed by the queen! Buy this book and ye won't be hornswaggled. Time to weigh anchor and hoist the mizzen, and thanks to me readin' of How to Avoid Huge Ships we'll be right hearty and shipshape.-The Cap'n"
1,Don't order gift-wrapped,I ordered mine gift-wrapped for a Christmas present. While being shipped here the delivery boat was hit by huge ship and sunk. If only it wasn't gift-wrapped then perhaps my shipper would have had a chance to consult the book when he first saw the huge ship and avoid this tragedy.
3,"Good, but....","As a long time seaman, I deeply enjoyed this read. I must request that the author write other books with the same informative wit as he did with this book. For instance, and I'm just spitballing here, ""How to Avoid Huge Tuscan Islands""."
2,Such a deceptive Title!!,"Perfect, I thought, a book that will finally help me avoid getting run over by big ships. Only problem - the ships I've spent years avoiding aren't 'big' enough for this boat. Well Excuse me for merely trying to avoid large tugboats and party barges and not massive cruise vessels and tanker ships.I've returned the book and will be anxiously awaiting 'How to avoid big ships that aren't classified as huge'."
3,What about SMALL ships?,"As one who is prone to being struck by all manner of sea vessels, I naturally picked up this useful book. Certainly, it covers its topic well, since I learned very clearly how to maneuver in the impending approach of a huge ship. That problem has been solved. However, it has created a new one: I am routinely being menaced by small ships - life boats, canoes, dinghies, etc. Might I suggest an epilogue in a second edition, or perhaps a companion volume? It would certainly save me some kayak-shaped bruises."
5,This happened to me...,"..and I wrote about it in ""latitude 38"" in the 90's. (an article called the Black wall). Ok, so I don't know if it exactly qualifies because it was a mega- barge being pushed by a Mega-tug in San Francisco Bay.But if this book keeps other sailors out of the way of mega-barges, I say buy it and read it. Two things though. One, I wasn't killed. Two, I had always hoped that when I wrote in about "" This happened to me"" it would be a letter to Penthouse not a book review.Gary ""the peg leg"" Lee"
3,Only Half the Story,"I was excited when I first received ""How to Avoid Huge Ships."" Even at a price I could barely afford, I knew it would be invaluable to me. After I finished it, I couldn't wait to try out the amazing techniques for avoiding huge ships, but, alas, there were none to be found. That's when I discovered that I had only gotten half the story. I was now bound by my excitement to purchase, at an even higher price, the companion piece to this tome, ""How to Find Huge Ships."""
1,This book does not work,"I read this hastily constructed piece and committed every passage to memory. Meticulous in my memorization, I can assure you that I acquired a firm grasp of every concept presented therein, including: looking around, dodging, signaling, and staying on land. Well, the proof is in the pudding, people. I applied EVERY principle that I learned in this book to my aquatic voyages and have amassed a series of collisions with other vessels such as: the Edmund Fitzgerald, the Exxon Valdez, the Yarmouth Castle, the Carpathia, the Bismark, and yes, you guessed it, the Titanic. While many have attributed the sinking of these ships to other factors, it is a little known fact that my application of the principles written in this book are to blame.Don't buy this book. In fact, in my opinion it should be removed from shelves altogether and retitled, ""How To Hit Huge Ships""."
5,The Christmas Miracle,"It was a cold christmas morning. I woke to a suspicious looking box upon my outside floor mat. I think the package was sent to the wrong house, but I decided to keep the thing. It was Christmas after all, the season of giving! I opened up the package and dug around. I found in my hand, a paperback book, called ""How to Avoid Huge Ships."" My first thought was ""At least I saved some unfortunate sailor from a Huge-Boat-less Christmas."" read a book while in my bedroom. I come out after two hours of reading the book front to back. I was aware of the dangers of huge boats like never before. John W. Trimmer, my hat is off to you. You opened my eyes to the world of tom foolery custumarily neglected by bus drivers, accountants, and pedestrians along with seamen. But with the knowledge from this book, I am safe against the threat of a huge ship running me over. It was a christmas miracle!"
3,Weight Watchers trepidation,"I always thought a sea cruise would be delightful but the thought of anything ""huge"" was disconcerting.And probably not good at all for our goddess mother Earth.But, after reading this enlightening book, I found my earlier craving for jumbo ships completely gone!Though I still enjoy the sauce!Anyway, I'm thinking of a non-huge ship, sort of a skinny ship but my friends tell me they tend to tip over.Especially the Italian ones.What do you think?I've heard that Guam may have that same problem.With all the navy guys overloading it and all."
5,You will never encounter huge ships again,Easily the best huge ship avoidance educational book on the market. I have tried others --- and was still running into huge ships. This book is the go to guide for avoiding huge ships.
5,Huge Ships and the Decline of Western Civilization,"The national bestseller that shocked the nation—""How to Avoid Huge Ships"" is an unflinching look at the increasing decline in Western maritime culture and power.The huge ships of the West are dying. Collapsing shipping rates in Europe and the U. S., coupled with explosions of smaller, less huge craft in Africa, Asia and Latin America are set to cause cataclysmic shifts in world shipping power, as boatloads of unchecked shipping swamps and polarizes every Western society and nation.""How to Avoid Huge Ships"" details how a civilization of huge ships are passing away. Remember the old saying, ""So go the huge ships..."" The author foresees a new world order that has terrifying implications for our huge ships, our faith, and the preeminence of American maritime culture.""How to Avoid Huge Ships "" is a timely, provocative study that asks the question that quietly troubles millions: Are the huge ships we grew up with gone forever?"
2,A mixed bag,"I find it sad that the primary theme of this book is how to AVOID huge ships, when what huge ships want the most is to be understood.Still, I'm giving it two stars because a huge ship killed my mother."
1,TOO Informative.,Read this book before going on vacation and I couldn't find my cruise liner in the port. Vacation ruined.
3,Caution: Check the title before purchase,"I live near a park and frequently walk around the local area. Given the amount of dog mess that is on the pavements I thought this book would be the ideal read to stop me having to scrape my shoes on the grass before going home. It was only after it arrived that I looked closely at the title and realised it said 'How to Avoid Huge SHIPS'. A simple error that means I am still treading on massive examples of canine excrement. Having said that, I read the book anyway, and I'm pleased to say I'm not even having near misses with huge ships anymore. No sir, they aint getting anywhere near me!"
2,Unemployment Opportunity,"When I majored in Mass-Vess in Engineer School I exepected that I would gradaute and be able to get a job in massive Vessels. Now I m out of school 3 yrs and there ARE no jobs. Who cares about AVOIDING huge ships, you can't even FIND one! This book is like totally obselete."
4,It's always worth planning ahead,"Little does my wife know, but I've been renting a small boat just down the road from our house.It's a very reassuring feeling, knowing that I have this book to hand should a huge ship sail from around the corner and surprise me. My wife would never have had the forethought to purchase such an item."
1,Discrimination at it's Worst,I am offended. Do you think that a book on How to Avoid Tiny Ships would even be considered by a publisher? The very thrust of this book is on how to continue the millenia long ostracisation of ships that happen to be larger than average. Those ships were built to the exacting specifications of their naval engineer and ship builder and need friends too.
1,Not for dyslexics,"After suffering for years, I bought this in the naive hope it would help regulate my bowel movements. A disappointment."
2,Harrrgh! Not right for sea-faring pirates!,"Avast! As a sea-faring fellow long used to the nuances of the billowing main, I purchased this book in the hopes of learning the secrets of avoiding British Man-o-wars. Alas, there be little here for my special interests. That said, there be fathoms of fascinating information for the leisurely landlubber what dreams of the ocean."
5,Too Late for me!,"As a Navy Veteran I constantly had to deal with HUGE ships on a daily basis. I only wish that I had had this book!!Unfortunately, I ran into this really like huge ship on my last watch. God bless the author and If I had only had this book 5 years ago!!!!"
2,Drought makes this unnecessary,"We don't see too many huge ships in my neck of the woods anymore, thanks to our lingering drought. Which is good because, though I'm sure the advice herein would be invaluable, at way more than a dollar a page (used) this book is just too expensive. Maybe the publisher could see the way clear to a cheaper edition, because someday the creeks will rise again and, well, you never know..."
2,Didn't quite cut it.,"After having read ""Chicken Soup for the Soul: How to Avoid Huge Ships"" I think Trimmer's book pretty much just repeats it's predecessor. The Chicken Soup book has not only a whole bunch of good of tips on how to get out of the way of huge ships, but also very nice (and sometimes extremely graphic) pictures. My tip to this author would be to print the next edition loaded with graphics of successful huge ship avoidances, as well as less successful ones."
2,Not helpful for a Kansan,"Though I found this book well-written and fast-paced, it had no practical information for me, being from Kansas. We have have no huge ships here. I was really hoping for a section on avoiding small and medium-sized boats, but was sorely disappointed."
3,Second Edition is WAY better than the first,After reading the first edition I had absolutely no idea how to avoid large ships. Luckily this was remedied by the second edition.A must read!
5,10 Years too late,"This book was ten years too late in the writing, ""it was a foggy morning about 12 miles off of shore, the ship was a 700 footer, we did not see it or hear it coming.Then the water was a swirling, the noise was a thundering, the ship appeared out of the devil's mist, a mere 90 feet away steaming on a collision course"",But alas this book would not have helped since I was on Lake Michigan and itwas a huge ""Boat"" not a ship coming to make toothpicks out of my sailboat and I.Maybe his next book will be on a topic of help to me."
2,Incomplete coverage,"Now, don't get me wrong. This book has proven to be invaluable in avoiding huge ships. In fact, after reading this, my collisions with huge ships dropped to only 3 a week.However, SNAME regards only ships in the 800-1200 foot range as ""huge"". This book is only applicable to that range. To learn about the other ship sizes, you have to buy the other 11 books.So, despite this extremely helpful book, I still got hit by 7 separate supertankers on my way to work. 2 stars."
3,"Insightful, But Confusing","I've must of crashed into huge ships a dozen times over the past 3 weeks. I've tried everything...'everything' meaning I tried to go through the huge ship. Now I must say I'm about half way through the book and I'm starting to get what he's trying to convey, however i'm still a little lost as to what you have to do when your small ship is in front of a huge ship. For instance, it states to go around the huge ship...however does this mean you go through the huge ship? And what happens if you do happen to go through the huge ship? Do you have to go around the ship, loop around, and go through the huge ship? Or do you just go through the huge ship? And hypothetically speaking let say you ""go through the huge ship"", what's to stop someone from going through the huge ship? Going through the huge ship?? I just feel like i'm missing something here..."
4,What a relief!,I no longer have to worry about how to avoid huge ships. It is now safe to go back in the water. Thank you for ending my huge ship collision nightmares.
