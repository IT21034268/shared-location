2,i didnt like it much,take some advice from a 10 year old the movie wasnt that good and one part didnt make sence so dont get the movie
4,:0),How can u not like JUMANJI alot of action and fun it almost makes u feel like your playing the game with them
3,A single jarring note,"I love this movie, but it has one terrible flaw, and it saddened me greatly to hear it. When the grown boy is seeking the girl he once played with, he mumbles disparagingly that she is probably living in a trailer park.And with that snobbish aside, from a person I formerly respected as a humanist, a million kids - who live in trailer parks or the equivalent - were ushered out of the fun.It would be worth sending it to that company in Utah that edits out bad words and sex scenes, to get that cruel sentence removed."
2,"Too dumb for adults, too scary for kids","This movie is too scary for kids...with all kinds of dark scary things manifesting from out of walls and sucking you in...and for adults too dumb. Perhaps the silliest thing is that Robin Williams' character has spent most of his life ""in the game"" and was living as a knife-wielding jungle-man...and then he decides to play again once he comes back...and what happened...just sits down with two kids, and a woman...that's it. Oh my God, what an idiot. I would get guns (rifles and shotguns), machetes, gear, etc...and when I started playing again I would be so so very much better prepared to deal with all the stuff that comes at you. Little kids might overlook this point and so might others, but you won't now that you've read this..Don't watch this movie: duh."
2,Quite OK!,"An average movie, the effects are a bit dated, but it is QUITE OK! The quality of this DVD is very good."
2,"Not as good as the book, which was weird enough anyway","This terrifying film is not for children. The effects are fine, if you like this kind of thing. But really, the story is sad and unfair."
4,Would u like a board game like this?,"I first saw this movie at the movie theatres when I was 7. Now I am 14 and I still like this movie. It is about a board game, when you play it real things from the jungle come to life from the game. Four characters must finish the game to make everything from the game go away. I am very impressed with the way the animals and the effects looked. The actors did an excellent job especially Bonnie Hunt and Robin Williams. The movie went by smoothly. I enjoyed the movie a lot. The movie may be a little dark because my little sister was scared the first time she saw it. Everytime she watches it more she gets less scared. I don't know why. I recommend this movie to anybody!"
4,"Disappointing Video Quality, Very Good Audio Quality","Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.I was disappointed in the video quality. It just wasn't that good. I kept thinking that it wasn't much better than the DVD. I only give it an 8.0 on a 10.0 scale, with 10 being the best. Aspect ratio was 1.85:1, so there were no black bars on the top and bottom. I wish it would have been 2.40:1.The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack was pretty good, great in parts.This is a good movie, that I have always enjoyed watching."
4,This is funny! Kind of strange too.,"Well, some parts are. The part with the monkeys in the kitchen sort of was. So was the part when the water burst out of the door on the police guy and the aunt. It was okay, mostly. The lesson from it was never take home something strange. Don't be too curious. Still, I recommend it to people who like adventure."
3,Wild animals are not pets,"A little boy and his friend discover a board game that brings the wild jungle right in his house and takes him prisoner. So many years later, another boy and girl (who move into the boy's house) release him from the game and have to finish the original in order to send all the jungle creatures back from wence they came. Excellent special effects keep this entertaining amid William's usual emmotional style of humor that gets tiring after 2 or 3 viewings of MRS. DOUBTFIRE. Suspenseful and action packed with chills if you watch in the theatre. Grier is funny as the cop and Byrd is pre H20."
1,JUMANJI,"I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM, THOUGH I HAVE SEEN IT ON TV. IT IS A GOOD ENTERTAINING MOVIE. I RECOMMEND."
5,Jumanji DVD Combo,Jumanji is a great movie for all ages. The DVD Combo pack is an exceptional value. Especially for those of us who do not have a Blue Ray player yet. Keep up the good work Amazon.
5,Great movie,I enjoyed this movie when it came out years ago and I love it in Blu-ray! The picture is crisp and the sound is perfect! The color is great and the special effects make me laugh. A wonderful experience.
5,fun movie,We have had the dvd of this movie since it first came out. It's amazing the improvement in the clarity. The movie holds up over time. It's just a good movie.
3,nothing like the book,The book was so much better than movie could ever be. So many things were changed that were just not necesary. I guess that it was okay for what it was. I just enjoyed the book more.
4,Great for soccer fans,This just sits on a chair in my sons room but he loves it! He is a huge soccer finatic and his favorite color is green. Cute decor for soccer themed room!
4,Definitive,I love this book. I got it about a year ago and I read it cover to cover over the course of a month. It makes great bathroom reading! The thing that's really great about this book is that you get the story behind all of the songs. Reading the backstory for all of my favorite tunes gave them a new life and made me want to go listen to them again -- to see them in that new light. Another interesting aspect is that even the covers are given some backstory -- including extensive information about the orig. artists. Then there's the in-depth information about the Dead themselves. Want to know more about Tom Constantine? It's there. Interested in Bruce Hornsby's connection to the Dead? It's there too. Overall I love having this book in my collection. It's a great reference book as well as a damn good read. I strongly recommend this to all Dead-heads!
2,This book is a pastiche of other earlier books,"It is hardly definitve in that, for two things, it doesn't even mention Hank Harrison and plays down Pig Pen McKernan's role in forming the band. Not mentioning Harrison (or bad rapping him) is ironic since the book cover emphaiszes, in large print, the words THE DEAD, which is, not coincidentaly, the title of Harrison's trilogy, Trager can hardly be thought of as a literary artist. I give it 2 stars for reference only."
4,Very enjoyable read,I love almost everything Stephen King and was very disappointed when this book was done. It was such an interesting plot and the characters felt real. I highly recomend this book.
1,"Not a story, just a printed trailer","Save your money - this isn't a complete story, just a printed trailer for the TV series. Bought it, read it, and returned it in disgust."
5,A suspenseful look at tragedy,"Narrated by the author, The Journals Of Eleanor Druse: My Investigation Of The Kingdom Hospital Incident is the true story of a female spiritualist. Drawn to a Maine hospital built upon a site where, in 1869, a textile mill burned down killing dozens of workers including child laborers, Eleanor Druse pretended to be ill in order to search for the ghost of a young girl and root out the presence of an ancient evil. A suspenseful look at tragedy and how its negative ripples can carry over space and time, The Journals Of Eleanor Druse is literally haunting to listen to and highly recommended. Four 1 1/2 hour audio cassettes."
3,How does it end??,"Working steady 3-11, I am not able to keep up with the Kingdom Hospital TV series. I read the book thinking I'd get to the end and KNOW what happens. Well....It ain't there. No ending. No clue to the ending. It only sucks you in to watching the series.Unless there are going to be more journals??"
2,I'm glad I checked it out from the library.,"I wouldn't have bothered to read this if I had realized that it's just a teaser for King's new TV show. The ""story"" ends abruptly with no resolution, presumably to make one sure to tune in to get one, which makes me feel cheap and used. I'd probably be more disgruntled but I didn't actually purchase the book.Other than that, it's not an abysmally bad story, but it's not great or ground-breaking either. The plotline seemed a little too generic for King, which makes more sense now that I have read that it's a re-interpretation of a work by Von Trier.I think some of King's work is really excellent, but I would rank this towards the bottom of his writings. That said, being ranked low for King is better than some author's best, especially in the ""horror"" genre."
2,So where's the rest of it????,"I was intrigued by the now cancelled TV show and so decided to pick up the book that the show was based on so I could have some closure on the story. Unfortunately, the book is nothing more than a lead in to the show. The books ends about where the show picks up. Needless to say I am still in the dark about where the story goes and how it ends. Very frustrating. It was a decent book up to the abrupt and unsatisfying ending."
1,Is King Druse?,"I have been reading this book and am annoyed that I can put it down and, when I pick it up again, cannot begin to tell whether I've already read the section I begin reading. It is flat, with no real suspense, unless you count the question, ""Was this really written by Stephen King?"" as part of the book. It is pretty far off in its depiction of the paranormal, beginning with the ants. If this is King's work, he has succeeded at seeming to be a complete amateur. If it is Druse's, why is it a work of fiction? Sorry, this book makes me ""harrumph."" I wish I'd bought something else."
1,What has happened to Stephen King?,"Journals is nothing more than a teaser for the upcoming ABC movie. The story is not original and, frankly, much of it doesn't even make sense. I have been a King fan since Salem's Lot when I was only in high school. I have always looked forward to his new releases. After the Ellen Rimbauer dud and now this one, I wonder if King has lost his spark. His writings have, in the past, always had an edge that made you wonder what was going on in his head. This book and the Ellen Rimbauer Diary are like warmed up leftovers. My advice is don't waste your time on this book."
1,Hated It!!!,"I loved the television series, so I thought I'd check out the book.Huge Mistake!!This novel went absolutely no where. I hated it!Come to think of it, the book doesnt even deserve the time its taken me to reveiw it."
1,a sorry bit of commercialism,"I should have known better after the ""Rose Red"" trash. This is a cheap ploy to sucker you in to watching the series. Not only that , I've noticed Stephen King's current writing is concerned more with his pet peeves, political leanings, and predjudices than with telling a good story. Maybe it is time for King to retire."
1,"Well, I read it, not sure why.","This book has an incredibly slow start. I wasn't until about page 92 that the story actually got a bit interesting. This book made me remember why I don't read Stephen King. It was just out of despiration, and the fact that I didn't have another book with me that I actually continued to read it. If I hadn't spent $20 on it, I would have gotten rid of it."
2,Not worth reading as a stand-alone.,"Oh, what a waste of time. Maybe it's good in tandem with the (now cancelled) TV show, but alone it's tedious, it drags, and, since it's designed to get you to watch the show, has no real resolution or denoument. If you MUST read it, get it from the library, don't waste your money."
1,Stolen work of Lars Von Trier,"Else then creating personalities to cover his complexes (first Bachman and now Eleanor), Mr King has now bacame a thief. Go wach the original Tv-series art by Lars Von Trier, The Kingdom. A 8 part post-modern TV series about unnatural events that take place in a hospital.There must be a border between the art of writing/literature and marketing tricks. And Mr.King has just crossed it.Stephen is now writing under the name Eleanor. After Richard he has developed another personality. Just a marketing trick. AND HE HAS STOLEN LARS VON TRIER's work, THE KINGDOM (or did he bought it?)anyway it is all a fraud. Shame on you mr king.You may trick the ""culture-free"" illiterate americans. But not everyone."
1,very disappointing!,As an avid reader of the horror genre and scary books I was disturbed that this was neither. One could not even classify this as a mystery or suspense. It is really utter nonsense. It is insulting for the author to claim that he is a trained investigator in any sense. Yet he willingly without any investigation gets involved in blood rituals and seances. Any expert in the occult has a healthy respect for the preternatural. Nany Drew would have done a better job on any one of the highly suspicious and improbable cases. This book should be geared for the 6 to 9 year old age group and unless they are camping alone in a cemetary at midnight on a full moon they would not belive or be scard. This book was a waste of money.
3,Spinecar Album,"This album is ok, not too sure at first, it grows on you, it's worth trying if you like Spinecar's work. I MAY buy another Spincar albumLee Pearson"
3,Get the newest edition if possible!,Get the newest edition if you need this book for a class. You will get lost if you get this edition. Other than that... the book was helpful in using other methods other than algorithms.
3,Not too helpful!,"This book is not really helpful for teachers in methods classes. I was not impressed with the lay out, or the accessibility to information. I consider this book a waste of my money!"
4,Good compilations by NG,"The album cover and official Amazon review seen here refer to a compilation released on the Hemisphere label and not the album being sold (BMG label) by Amazon.Still, both are worth buying. The BMG album is a compilation of NG's early-mid period and the Hemisphere one compiles their mid-late period."
1,This really doesnt deserve a 1 but it wont go lower,"First off its in Japanese and didn't come with subtitles (at least for kindle) . Girls get attacked by evil ninjas women who spend most of the movie beating and choking the heroes. The action scenes are right out of 1970's scripted wrestling. Our heroins get punched, knocked to the ground, and kicked repeatedly (usually in the head) then get up and run away. I suppose that getting punched and kicked for 5-10 minutes and not being hurt is easily possible since it hardly ever looked like any of the blows made contact.This movie has no nudity, sexuality, or real plot. Its just a long poor mock combatfest that actually makes the Power Rangers look realistic by comparison. Save the precious minutes of your life by NEVER watching this!"
3,Does not fit so well,"I purchased this item for our 2 electric toothbrushes, and for unknown reason one of the heads (out of 4) do not fit tight on one brush!! This are supposed to be genuine Braun heads (well I hope)."
1,incorrect addresssent him to another place,the address which was delivered my product was not specified and I need to know how it will solve the asusuto I wonder if I still have the product since it was deducted from my card
4,majormuffin,"This is the best sunshield I have ever owned. It fits just like it should and is built very well, maybe to well. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that the sunshield is very stiff. The stiffness makes it a little difficult to place it on the inside of the windshield. I have owned and used it for 2 years. It is still like new. I would buy it again."
4,"Very good, no problem",Recently I have received my laptop; laptop is my first and I am being used to to me using it unlike my desktop. I at a disadvantage do not have some thing of laptop; it is very well for my expectations and my work.
2,Fuel Pump,"Though I'm sure that this pump would've operated properly,,, I was Extremely Disappointed that the Carter pump that was sent to me, looked NOTHING like the pump in the picture (instead, it was the newer style, bolt-together type),, and when you're trying to restore an old Mustang and the pump is suppose to appear a certain way (like in the advertised picture), that's what you expect to receive. It's all about the details!Doug S."
2,Not impressive,"I bought this cd player a year ago and I have been very disappointed. The cd changer is noisy when switching cds and the sound quality is very low. My dvd player puts better sound out than this unit. The unit is attractive and having a 5 disc player is nice at times, but this unit is not worth the money."
4,I just got my RCA CD/MP3 Player tonight,"I was reluctant to buy this cd player (RCA not my favorite), but my girlfriend convinced me to get it. At home I tried an old cd with a large number of mp3s and the device did not recognized them. I then realized that particular cd was not finalized so I tried with a cd that was finalized and it worked great. For a 100 dollars it's worth every penny."
1,"Five disks, no music!","I was very intrigued to see that RCA was offering a CD changer that played MP3. While RCA received mediocre reviews online, and I couldn't find any reviews of this player in specific, I took a gamble and ordered one. It arrived (single boxed), I unpacked it, and immediately noticed its light (cheap?) plastic construction. Plugged it in, popped in some disks, and ... nothing! It recognized the disks, but would not play them. Amazon graciously agreed to send me another unit second day, and paid for the the original's return. The second unit arrived, this time it would not even accept disks. I was wary of RCA's reputation when I ordered this unit. This experience has buried it for good. A definite do not buy."
4,Found it!!!,AutoCAD 2002 for DummiesFound what I was looking for...Great Book!!! Book was in very good condition and was shipped out pretty rapidly. Thanks!!
2,Strong magnets but really thin- wont hold thicker paper. Mounting screw included broke while screwing it in to wood cabinet,"I just received this 5 minutes ago.I went right away to get my husbands screwdriver. I screwed one screw into our wood armoire and was working on the second when the tip of the screw just fell off- and taking the old screw out of my armoire was very difficult. I didn't want to ruin my wood armoire, or ruin e hole for the next screw that I went to get ( one of our own). Can't they at least put decent screws in with this???!! I've never had a screw break like that on me ( I'm not a big person, so there wasn't a lot of weight behind my effort)."
4,What Drives John Kerry,"For anyone that is interested in knowing what makes John Kerry tick, this is a book that must be read. John Kerry's extraordinary devotion to public service can be explained by reading of his experiences, as detailed by Douglas Brinkley. This is not a so-called ""campaign biography,"" as has been claimed by several other reviewers. This is a detailed description of John Kerry's service to the country, both during and after the Vietnam War. Anyone who doubts Kerry's courage and tenacity will be disabused of those doubts upon reading this book. I highly recommend it."
1,Happy Anniversary Americans!,"It was just a little over 13 months ago that Americans flushed this john and voted for leadership. We didn't buy into the lies or false claims of heroism perpetrated by Kerry and writers like Brinkley who rely on their subject for facts (fat chance)The economy is moving well. Iraq is moving well regardless what Kerry says. This Kerry promotional piece did not work and thank God for that.HAPPY ANNIVERSARY AMERICANS! WE ALL ""FLUSHED THE JOHNS IN 2004!"""
1,Kerry's X-Mas '68 in Cambodia LIE has him spending New Years '06 in Boston,This book along with the book by George Butler is so full of crap and hype about Kerry that it makes me laugh. Should be listed as fiction and would make for a great novel. Everybody who really knows Kerry laughs whenever mention of this book is brought up.Those who knew Kerry back in 1966-67 knew how much he wanted to prevent being drafted and stay out of the service. Kerry claiming to be a war hero is like Michael Moore claiming to be an athlete. Give me a break!
1,Not True,"The truth has finally come out. The Swift Boat Veterans finally got it in the open.John Kerry is a liar, nothing more, nothing less"
1,This book is being revised - so the FACTS can be adjusted,"I started reading it, but couldn't continue when I found out that the ""Facts"" were being altered by Kerry and Brinkley. In the meantime, read ""Unfit for Command"". It gives several excerpts from this book anyway. Then maybe when the new version of the NON fiction comes out I'll read it. Although, I thought NON fiction was truth and truth couldn't be changed... I guess it depends on whose truth it is. I gave it one star because it's pretty thick and I think it probably took a lot of imagination to come up with that much."
2,Tour of Duty,"I purchased this book to try and learn a little more about the man who would be the Democratic nominee, and frankly I didn't feel I learned anything that his sound-bytes harp on me over and over. The book is a long and dry book that's quite slow of a read. Kerry strikes the reader throughout the book to continue to be a condescending bag of hot air aimed at ruining this country via his hypocracy."
1,This book is bull!,"I never got past the chapters of Kerry's experiences on the USS GRIDLEY. Since I served with him the entire year, I can assure readers that it is filled with exaggeration and fantasy. Kerry makes himself out to be Master and Commander when he was just a goofy boot Ensign. There are a number of things that are just plain not true and lots of exaggeration. It is not a serious work but clearly a piece of campaign fluff.Don't waste your money unless you are Democratic to the core and need some fluff to get you excited!"
1,Half-Tour of Duty,"I find it absoultely incredible that someone believes everything that is shoved down their throats. Just because some historian says that he is a hero does not mean that he is. I tried to read this book, but couldn't finish, it was that bad. Kerry's ""purple hearts"" shouldn't even count. I mean, look at the guy. He has NO visible injuries and he got out of vietnam with Purple Hearts???All three purple hearts were signed on the SAME DAY. John Kerry does not deserve to even be called a veteran, much less a hero."
4,"A Well-Researched, Thoroughly Documented View of A True Hero","Having already proven himself to be one of our best biographers today, with his books on Dean Acheson, JFK, FDR, Jean Monnet, James Forrestal, Henry Ford, Rosa Parks, and others, Douglas Brinkley has done it again with a terrific look at the truth behind an American veteran, politician and lifelong public servant.Only the ignorant and openly biased will dismiss this highly-detailed examination of John Kerry's war experience, from growing up in Denver and his education at Yale through to his trials, triumphs, and ultimate disgust with the Vietnam War. Any questions you have about Kerry's character or his military service - especially those invented by political opponents who instead backed a corrupt coward named W - you'll find the answers right here.If you value truth over hype and courage over self-serving cronyism, you'll enjoy this book."
3,Worthwhile Account of a Young John Kerry,"I had no plans to read this book, but after receiving it as a gift, I gave it a whirl. I am glad that I did. While Brinkley deserves some chiding for only bringing campaign biography analytical rigor to the subject, he does a fine job of describing John Kerry's life during the Vietnam era, and more generally, presenting the difficult choices that Americans of Kerry's generation faced. Kerry comes off as an admirable (though certainly not faultless) young man making his way through difficult time with intelligence and integrity."
4,Don't Judge the Man; Judge the Book,"This book was well-written and well-researched, regardless of how I may feel about Kerry's political stance. My husband is retired Navy, a veteran of the riverine war in Vietnam. My husband read this book and recommended it to me, not on the basis of the character (or lack thereof) of John Kerry but because the descriptions and history of the riverine war were accurate. For those who want to disparage the book, there are numberless accounts of Vietnam veterans whose time in-country lasted a day or lasted five years. My husband reads every one he can get his hands on, so I know they are out there. That he recommended this to me above so many others he has read is because, in his words, ""this one is accurate."" Forget that John Kerry happens to be the sailer in question and study the Vietnam War."
4,Good intro into Kerry's life and character,"I enjoyed this book. John Kerry seems to get more interesting the more you look into him. The portrait given is a moralist, a thinker, who struggled with the great questions of his age. I hope more people will read about Kerry's life, not just judge him by the sound bites and attack ads. Brinkley does a good job of humanizing the man behind the political persona."
1,Waiting for the rewrites.,"After I bought this book and started reading it, I discovered that the author, Douglas Brinkley is doing a rewrite because some of the information provided by Senator Kerry has turned out to be false and misleading. And as I understand it, the changes are still coming. Perhaps Mr. Brinkley should have done himself a favor, and written this book in pencil. It's a lot easier to clean up the errors that way. Are they going to issue free addendums of the new rewrites, or am I going to have to buy a whole new book to get the newest version of Kerry's story?"
1,Tour of Duty,"This book is nothing but lies and propaganda. Nothing in this book is factual. Nothing but ""Walter Mitty""."
3,Sadly Unreliable and thus Unusable,"Sorry, but if the vote were today, I'd have to go with Nader, with Kerry my reluctant, weak second choice. Brinkley was USED in writing this book but only because he allowed himself to be used. He has revised its anecdotes since publication, in order to assist Kerry, only to find both his original tales AND his revisions contradicted by Kerry, through Kerry's ""people"". The result is that it is dangerous to cite this book or rely on it for quotes. It is insanity for Kerry to build his candidacy around his service in southeast Asia. Brinkley must be quite enamored of Kerry in order to put up with this destruction of his credibility. It's a pity."
1,Total Puff Piece,"If you believe the picture painted in this book about Kerry, I have a bridge for sale. This is a complete puff piece that no self respecting ""Historian"" would publish. Read ""Unfit for Command"" to get the truth!"
2,Fact or Fiction,"Have found significant portions of book embelished to point of fiction. Real story was good without the self serving embelishment. Brinkley missed a great opportunity to tell true story, makes John Kerry big target for those of ill will who know real story. Brinkley ghost writer not historian with this book."
1,Kerry's Tour Of Duty For North Vietnam,"The book has no information on Kerry's ""tour of duty"" with Hanoi Jane and her gang.Nothing on how North Vietnam's leader dredit Kerry & Fonda for saving North Vietnam from defeat. Nothing on how Kerry's family financial benefitted from the normalization of relations with his old comrades in the ""new"" Vietnam."
1,Garbage,"Nothing but a whitewash of Kerry's military ""career"" intended as propaganda for support of Kerry's political ambitions.John Kerry's entire life is a lie. This book takes from Kerry's writings the false biography of his Vietnam experiences. It is nothing but a rehash of Kerry's false reports and self-glorifying phony biography."
1,"Tour of Duty, offensive and Insensitive","As a Viet Nam war veteran, I am completely offended by Tour of Duty, which is nothing more than an attempt to exploit a bloody conflict (in which over 35,000 Americans died) to promote the Kerry candidacy for the presidency. This is not only inappropriate but is egregiously insensitve to both the survivors of that war and the families of its victims! It is exactly the kind of opportunism one has come to associate with that portion of the political spectrum. John Kerry should apologize and immediately arrange for the removal of Tour of Duty from the shelves!!!"
1,Half the Story,"I'm afraid that Dr. Brinkley missed the boat on this one. By ignoring the Swift Boat Vets, he lost any claim to having written an honest biography of Kerry's war months. Kerry's unwillingness to release his military file would have signaled to any true biographer that there is more to this story than just Kerry's diary."
1,Campaign for Kerry,"To call this book an unbiased look at Kerry's life is extremely naive. From the very beginning it reads like a cheesy campaign commercial. If you like Kerry and his politics, you'll like the book, conversely if you don't, you won't."
1,Waste of time and money,"This book is a waste of valuable paper. Kerry is a freaking traitor and only received commendations because he had friends in high places. To anyone who supports him and his too obvious lies, you're dumber than I thought Americans ever would be. Kerry didn't do any more than any of our boys are doing out there every day, and less than most. I hated the book and have no respect for the man behind it."
1,"A Manufactured, Not Earned, Record","John Kerry gamed the awards and decs system--I saw it happen during my 12-month (not 4-month) tour of duty in Viet Nam. His book is nothing more than a compilation of fabrications to bolster his image for the 2004 election. John Kerry is a hero? Not! I believe the 250 men of the Swift Boats Veterans for Truth, not Kerry and his bought-off handful."
4,"conservatives smear kerry over ""hanoi Jane""","conservatives are excerpting the part of this book that supposedly documents Kerry's association with Jane Fonda to claim that Kerry was a supporter of ""hanoi"" Jane Fonda's attempt to""give aid and comfort to the enemy""."
1,Where's the disclaimer?,"Where's the Amazon free-fire zone disclaimer on this piece of lying crap. The chicken littles open up a valid expose like ""Unfit for Command"" to all abuse, but tuck their shiney jewels when the book is a self serving liberal load of trash like this.I had not previously assigned political motives to Amazon. Now I do. Now I'm gone!What's the address? Oh yeah, barnesandnoble.com"
1,Shame on Amazon.com's Political Bias,"The following disclaimer appears on the ""Unfit for Command"" Swift boat book:""Important note from Amazon.com: We've decided to suspend our normal customer review policies and rules for this title. For example, we usually prohibit ad hominem attacks. That policy in particular seems to be incompatible with presidential election year politics. Therefore, short of obscenities, reviews on this book are now a free-for-all. We take no responsibility for the following discussion. Aren't presidential election years great? Have fun!""Why is there no such disclaimer issued for this book? It seems that Amazon's political bias is showing! Shame! Shame! Shame!Until this same disclamer appears under ""Tour of Duty"" I will take my book buying business elsewhere!"
1,Kerry Kamera Hound Risking Lives,"Taking cheap political photo Op's while endangering my fellow Naval comrads' lives was reckless and insensitive. Kerry was booted out of VN due to his reckless disregard for the well being of his comrads' lives. After being kicked out of VN Kerry had a Hissy Fit Snit and Said ""I will show them"", and proceeded to betray his comrads all over again. We do not need a man with 57 positions on every issue that squeals like a stuck pig when the real truth comes out via Swiftees and/or Givem Hell Zell! When $62 million in ""drug money"" was spent to castigeate Bush it was OK; however the boonie is now on the other foot. The boonie now needs to be lodged in Kerry's appropriate 57 part anatomy."
1,Would make a nice pamphlet for Kerry's campaign,"This book makes for a great promotional piece and that is about all. For the true story, the whole story on John Kerry's ""Tour of Duty"" check out Unfit for Duty coming out next week. A book written by people who really knew the REAL John Kerry-The RAW Deal."
3,A general account,Tour of Duty is well written and entertaining. It does a good job of giving one a sense of Kerry's childhood and a reasonably good account of his actions in Vietnam. The post-Vietnam details are a bit thinner though. Also missing is any analysis or comparision of Kerry's actions with any facts. Thus one is left with a very one-sided view of John Kerry but an interesting view nonetheless. The book is worth reading for some general background but a more authoritative biography will probably have to wait until after (and if) he gets elected.
3,Just one question...,"If Mr. Valentine believes that ALL liberals are motivated by emotions and ALL conservatives are motivated by their logical heads, then why is the book called ""Right from the HEART""? I was just wondering..."
1,Into the disposal,"Hmmmm. ""Conservatives"" continue to applaud this sort of rhetoric as ""facts."" I continue to get e-mail from those who resent my characterization of Ann Coulter as a psychopath (""if she really believes the stuff she says, she's not taking her meds"") as if Coulter is a logician, not a hyperemotional media figure with a ""JD"" after her name.Well, this isn't quite as volatile as Coulter, but it's no more ""fact"" oriented. And it isn't ""conservative"" but reactionary statist.Why is it that, while the ""right"" seems to be powerful now, I see their days as numbered? I think it's because they take this stuff seriously. They'll become a product of nostalgia soon just like some from the '60s who're now making car payments, retiring, and living in Florida."
3,Nothing new here,"This book is useful as a compendium of standard conservative platforms and rhetoric but adds nothing new to the debate. Valentine is at least more thoughful and less spiteful and acidic in his writing, which might explain why this book is not as big a seller as the its more vitriolic cousins. However, it still presents the same old black & white world of ""conservative good,liberal bad,"" ""Reagan is God, Clinton is the devil"" you've heard a million times before. Take a pass on this one, unless you just have to have EVERY conservative book in print."
2,Effective and easy to read but the facts need work,"If conservatives rely on the facts and liberals on emotion, one would expect this to be a supremely liberal book. Characterizing Clinton as weak on the military or liberalism is one good example. The simple fact is that the US brushed away Iraq with a military force that had been trained and armed by the Clinton administration; yet Clinton was characterized as weak and anti-military. The Bush administration's failure to follow up on warnings issued by the Clinton administration about Al Qaeda and its plans to use aircraft in terrorist acts against the US are ignored. And so on. We could all benefit from a considered debate on this issues with the basic assumption that we are all in this together. Unfortunately this book is not a contributer to that cause."
3,Still Morphine... but...,"Recently rediscovered Morphine after watching the documentary ""Cure for Pain"" about Mark Sandman (highly recommend). This album was the only one missing from my collection. Not the classic Morphine sound, less emphasis on the baratone sax. I was really put off during the first listen because if this, but now I'm coming around a bit. Definitely worth a listen."
3,Morphine fan,"I have really enjoyed Morphine over the years and when I noticed that I didn't have the last CD, I just had to get it. I have listened to it a number of times now and can honestly say that it is my least favorite. It is just too mellow and lacks the energy that their other discs had. If you are a diehard fan then you should have this one in your collection. But if you are just a casual fan I would steer clear."
4,Chilling!,"I've been a Morphine fan for quite a while. And when I heard the news of Mark Sandman's (the singer)death, I feared the worst...NO MORE MEZMERIZING BEAUTY from the guys of Morphine. I recieved ""The Night"" on its release date and listened to it three times right away. While as a whole, While The Night is not the best of ""Morphine's"" albums (this album is different enough to be in a category itself)...there are songs on the disc that will become legendary to Morphine fans. The album is simply ""Chilling"". You get the usual Morphine dose of sax, bass, drum and VOICE...but with a new twist. There are some unique sounds on this album that just adds to the sad feeling one gets when the thought reaches the brain: ""Where would Morphine had gone if Mark Sandman had not traveled into THE NIGHT?"" Thank you Mark...for the beauty."
4,Climb the rope on fire,"The passing of Mr. Sandman is made even more sad by the fact that their studio swansong, while it may be the band's most subltle and lowkey album overall, shows no decline in creativity, musicianship or songwriting (the title track, for example, is perhaps the loveliest in the band's entire songbook)...In light of Sandman's untimely death, the element of melancholia which has been an ingredient on all Morphine albums is thrown into sharper relief here. Relatively humorous and /or uptempo numbers like ""A Good Woman Is Hard to Find"" & ""Top Floor, Bottom Buzzer"" provide enough levity to keep the album balanced, but few will mistake this for a party album.I don't know (or want to know) if Sandman had intended to close the album with a song titled ""Take Me With You When You Go,"" but it will likely leave many fans with a lump in the throat."
5,GENIUS BRILLIANCE!,"This is a very soft, beautiful album. I put it in my computer and fall asleep nearby... it's undescribeable. Not much like their past cds, this is late-night perfection, inbetween talkshows and driving through dark cities."
4,"""we said goodnight this morning""","simply said, The Night is the devil's coktail party music, deep dark dirty smoky and sexy all the good things you're not supposed to to love...as one of my friends always says...""morphine IS sex"""
2,Yawn...,"I took the gamble and purchased this CD because of some of the positive reviews that it was given. I'd never heard of Morphine but it felt like it was a worthy risk. I gotta admit I was disappointed. I just couldn't find much substance in the lyrical or instrumental composition. I listened to it many times hoping that I might discover some subtle appeal, but nuttin...I found it empty and boring."
1,no,I entered this red teddy bear a few days ago. The mail comes and I get a WHITE teddy bear with a red heart that's all dirty and covered in yellow stuff. So disappointed.
5,Nice Valentine gift!,"Bought this as a Valentine gift for my Secret Sister in church. She will love it! The price was great, brand new item, fast shipping."
2,"Great political treatise, lousy literature","Bless him for keeping this one short, unlike his contemporaries in Russian literature. Unfortunately, the fact that this book is 200 pages is the best thing I can say about it. This is so clearly the case of an author who had a political statement to make and decided, unwisely, to couch it in a fictional as opposed to non-fictional format. This would have made for a great political or sociological treatise, but it is not good literature. The characters and plot are so obviously secondary to the message. The characters are one-dimensional, predictable, and transparent. The plot is forgettable and really almost seems to have been an afterthought. The only real merit of this book is that it captures the birth of an important social and political movement, at a very pivotal time in Russian history."
5,Humanism for the Faithful,"This sympathetic portrayal of aristocrats, peasants, conservatives, progressives, radicals, nationalists, internationalists, romantics, and even nihilists is ultimately a work of great humanism in its best (and really its only) sense of men made in the image of God. Turgenev captures the vanity of youth, but considerately and without spite. It's an excellent book heartily recommended, even though he goes a little too easy on the progressives, radicals, internationalists and nihilists."
4,Cookware deliveres as promised,"Sturdy, enameled finish. Not non-stick ~ That info would have been helpful in description but still pleased with product.Fast shipping, well packaged.Thanks!"
2,"okay, not great","Lighter weight than I expected, and the lids aren't ""precision fit"" as the packaging states. The handles are a bit loose. They've been okay for the soups, stews, eggs and sauteed veggies I've made. An okay product if you can't afford the good enamelware."
5,ALL the House Beautiful books are a great resource!!,"I own most of the House Beautiful books and I just love them!! This one has so many great ideas for people just moving into a new home and ready to design their own space, or for those just wanting to add to their already stylish surroundings. I have clips marking pages throughout all my books and the clips come off and change pages as time passes. It's amazing that I keep finding new ideas, every time I look at this book! I highly recommend these books to a novice, an expert, or anyone in between for decorating inspiration. Have fun!!"
3,Just like you,"The title cut is one of the better tunes, Love has no walls is more of a soul filled tune. I would have to classify this cd as Contemporary Christian / Christian POP. I am waiting for a live CD because he is awesome live.Overall this cd you can tap your foot to and play it with the kids in the car and they will most likely enjoy it also."
5,Great CD!,"This is a great CD! I love Matthew West's music! If you enjoy any of his other cd's, than you'll love this one! The price is also great! Overall I thnk that this is one of his best cd's."
5,practical qnd classroom friendly,"This book is a wonderful resource book for any Language Arts teacher. The key to successfully using it is to find out what the child needs to learn to do to become a better reader. Then Mrs. Beers has listed what to do, and even shows how it has worked with real students. I know the activities could be used with first graders and on up. I taught Reading Recovery for ten years and have studied struggling readers for forty years, and I know these resources will work. I also like the authors she used to gather her research. She didn't just research through books, but also practiced these herself. Mrs. Beers has included places for busy teachers to go easily to find the materials to use. All Language Arts teachers shoud use this book."
4,practical,Very easy read and very practical.this book was required for one of my graduate classes in special ed.the situations described are relatable and the solutions are great
2,Just okay...,"I bought this book because I received a flyer in my school mailbox, and, as a teacher of students who struggle with reading, I thought it might have some helpful advice. I've looked through it several times, and I just can't get myself interested in the way it's written for some reason. I think that the ideas the author has, from what I've read, are good, but I also think that you would have to have the same classroom setup and amount of time in order to fully see these ideas come to fruition."
2,errors in appendix M,"I have not read this book, but I was given Appendix M as part of a list of suggested books for Summer Reading. As a librarian, I am appalled by the number of errors in this list of titles and authors. Students will have trouble finding several of these books when the authors' names and the titles are spelled incorrectly. How can we expect the best from students when we give them a sloppily edited list from which to choose their reading material? One example is ""Zusack, Markus. Fighting Reuben Wolf"", which should read ""Zusak, Markus. Fighting Ruben Wolfe."" Vivian Vande Velde's book is ""The Rumplestiltskin Problem"" not just ""The Rumplestiltskin."" This book is in desperate need of better editing before teachers use it to select books."
1,Beware!!!,Beware of all of the positive reviews! They are marketing plants! Notice that all of the 5 star reviewers only review shirts for this and another company.
2,I couldn't believe it...,I've never really had shirts 'break apart' like these did. They looked ok for a couple of washes but afterwards they completely fell apart. Simply a bad product. Not worth the cheap price.
1,Good deal & looks ok online - UGLY when it arrived,UGLY UGLY shirts. The texture/pattern was hiddeous. I immediately donated them to the Salvation Army truck around the block from my home - months after I dug them out of my closet. (It was too late to return them).
5,Great Fit...Great Value...Great Shirt,Bought 3 for myself they were wonderful. Came back for 4 more for gifts. Spent 9.99......people think I spent 30.00-40.00.
1,cheap item with expensive-sounding name,"Cheaply-made, strange cut, bad fit. Makes a great gift for a father-in-law from whom you do not expect any inheritance."
2,Misleading information,"I used to geocache and so I read this book with interest. The information is misleading (""GPSr: Slang of a GPS receiver."" An initialism is hardly ""slang"") to slightly dangerous (the author recommends turning off the GPS for most of your trek to ""save batteries."" Instead of losing your breadcrumb trail back to your camp or car, why not just carry spare batteries?).It appeared to me that the author had never really spent much time geocaching. Take his advice with a grain of salt."
2,The author keeps you guessing,"Besides, taking awhile to get into the book. The book is also very wordy and gory. That was enough for me to give it two stars. The thing that I liked best about the story is that you never know what is going to happen next. The author keeps you guessing constantly."
1,Lord of the Flies...,"I did not enjoy this book, I thought it was over-rated and quite boring. It has no real plot and the story line is a never-ending piece of text which in all honesty, bored me to tears!.I find that William Golding should not have had as much success as he did because the Symbolism is never ending and I can not handle how he symbolises even a scar or a pair of glasses worn by a fat kid.This book can easily be reduced from 225pages to at least 3pages. They are stranded, two boys die and they're rescued! Hooray! (As you can tell I'm being sarcaistic!)."
1,Robot Wars a must not see,"This movie is not very well written in my opinion and is probably a good thing that it is priced so high. Most of it is uninportant dailog that seems to have little or no piont with no story or structure. There is alittle action at the end, but of poor qualaty. To make a long review short, it is basically like a bad episode of G.I Jeo."
3,David Arkenstone soundtrack..,"The David Arkenstone soundtrack is really the best thing about this movie. The acting is passable, and the effects, while certainly better than BBC ""Dr. Who"" quality, could be better. If you like the ""giant robot"" genre, you'll probably like this."
3,Okay.,Not as good as Robot Jox which is the first movie. Not as much action but is a hard find and would be nice in a collection of big fighting sci fi robots like Transformers. Not really worth it.
3,"I'll Take This ""B"" Movie Over A Coma Anyday","I've seen hundreds of Sci Fi/Horror movies over the years. This is one of those you'll wonder whether you've watched it or not a few years down the road. You just can't remember.All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi/Horror movie than ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Evita"". This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma."
2,not worth the time and money,"1. too much subjective views, and some facts were ignored.2. it seems some film and photos were placed at the wrong time period, perhaps to make the biography more interesting.3. the Chinese maps were not accurate, the maps showed what china is now, but not the first half of the 1900s. it was larger at that time."
2,tabloid?,"It is tremendously difficult to describe the life of such a world political giant in 50 minutes. Yet this video spend 10% of the time telling stories of Mao's affair with some anonymous girls while many much more important historical events and persons were not even mentioned. The writer counted correctly how many times he married, but failed to say anything about his children.In summary, this documentary tries to cover both his political life and personal life, but end up getting none."
1,"Too Expensive, only 1 Sponge!","I was looking for a prime-able sponge, and found this. I don't know what I was expecting, 74 sponges for $8 seemed too good to be true, but I thought I'd try it anyway. Well, there is only one sponge. Said sponge is a scotch-brite scrub sponge, which is good, and it is also larger than your average sponge, but still $8 for a sponge?!?Maybe I'm not a sponge expert, but it seems a little high."
5,An excelent book on physics,"An excellent book about physics, its history and its philosophy. The concepts are well explained, discussed, compared in a conversational and rigorous style. And done with the contribution of Einstein.With this book you will understand what physics really is; what is behind the science undertaking; what is science after all. A must book to serious interested readers"
5,A very good book.,This is a really good book which clearly explains the evolution of physics from Newtons laws to Quantum mechanics in a simple and lucid language.Einstein was not only a genuis mathematician and physicist but also a great author and story-teller and no one else could have told the story of evoultion of physics better than EinsteinA book that should be in every phisicists library
3,"Too Simplistic, but interesting","This text is too simplistic, and its use at universities such as Columbia, Harvard and others is a problem. It has little math, and in effect, hardly prepares the student for the truly mathematically oriented study of Economics. Although this makes it easier to read, it is not appropriate for most colleges."
3,Not Bad (I Suppose),"This is pretty much your everyday introductory textbook. This in itself will be seen by many as a damning criticism. That said, there are a couple of notable features that differentiate it from other texts. (i) It is very easy to read thanks to its conversational tone. (ii) It is brief; it does not ""waffle on"" unnecessarily. (iii) The lay-out is quite pleasent. It should be noted that these points have their opposites for some."
2,Ridiculously biased,"This purports to be an objective examination of the principles of economics. Instead, it's a load of conservatively biased economics propaganda - without even a mention of opposing views. Dangerously influential, considering that it is used as a text for Introductory Economics at places like Harvard and University of Chicago."
1,"Great book, but do not order this edition","This edition reads like a photocopy of an early print edition. I am not old, but I had to strain and squint to get through it. No reflection of the book itself, but I nearly tossed it aside a dozen times it was so hard on the eyes."
2,Earlobes and sweat? Say it isn't so Dean. Say it isn't so.,"While the by-line is admirably short, the text actually comes off quite linguistically, given all the maladroit proclivities that might have prevented a lesser author from treading so smoothly on wings of bread and slurry. William, whose middle name - as we are to believe - is Dean, ends his saga with the name Howells. Some may enjoy this chicanery, but I, for one, was enormously displeased. For instance, why all that talk about trade agreements in the preface yet no listing for either ""trade"" or ""agreement"" in the index? And, I must ask, why was there no index at all? One is left to wonder what other key concepts and biographical references were left un-indexed. Is there any value in such a text? The answer, quite simply, is also not available in the index. Why? I became very angry by the end. All indexed. Why? The answer, quite simply, is given five sentences before this one. (The reader is advised to refer to it. (ed.))"
1,Worst Scholarship Possible!,"The author writes this book from a fundamentalist biblical perspective, which makes it like trying to argue the bible with someone who continuously quotes it out of context. The antique references show the author's bias. On reading the second chapter descriptions of ""secret societies"" a person who knows Egyptian history and religion cannot help but feel a twinge of pain at the outright falsity of almost everything he writes there. The same goes for the brief blurb on Gnosticism as well as most of the rest of it. Find a book that has a more balanced view of history and religious ideas and skip this one. If you consider your time of any value at all then reading this book definitely wastes it."
1,Conspiracy lunacy at its worst,"Still's book reads like a litany of modern urban legends. The Illuminai, Atlantis, even pre-Columbian Native American Freemasons! If you want to read something worthwhile on prophecy and conspiracy, look at Gregory Camp's ""Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-times Paranoia"", or Richard Abanes' End-Time Visions. William Still shows a chilling willingness to us facist sources to ""prove"" his conspiracy theories. Authors like Nesta Webster (British facist in the 1920's), Abbe Barrel, and John Robison are used as credible sources. Truly scary right-wing ideology, just this side of Tim McVeigh."
3,your journey to paranoia starts here,"This book is wickedly entertaining, and seems to make a lot of sense, although, giving a few months of time to think about the material made me realize that it was little more than good entertainment. Conspiracy theories are good fun and can make you snap out of boredom and skirt the boundary of paranoia, which is a testament to how dull our lives can be. This book may have you looking at everyone you see in a funny way for a while, but in the end it should be viewed as mere entertainment. Some of this junk may be true, and there are abundant cross references to the material, but this guy's whole mission of sending an alarm seems to be just a vice for his own self-aggrandizement. Good fun, but there is better material on this subject out there."
3,Reads like a summary of all the books it references,"This was a good book, though it borrows heavily from its references. I got the feeling reading it that I'd 'heard it all before'. I have personally known people who were Masons. As the book says, you can't really discern anything nefarious about them. You have to be 'an insider'. The book concentrated on Freemasonry, though later touched on the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and its 'secret agenda'. Though a good read, if you want more info you'd be better off getting books specifically on the CFR or Freemasonry."
2,Disappointing,"Another reviewer described Truman Capote's acting as unimpressive - decidedly a gross understatement. However, the main weakness of the film is the cornball cheap humor and lack of wit. The great cast is wasted throughout. It's worse than Mel Brooks ""History of the World"". Also, there are many convoluted attempts at twists and turns, but the results offer few surprises. In the end, it's more of a high-school script than a movie.The DVD extras are minimal and mostly unenlightening."
2,The real crime...,"...is the script. I am amazed at the rave reviews below. I envy their ability to laugh at jokes that wouldn't pass muster at Mad Magazine. The direction, by a theater director who seems to understand nothing about film, is flat and awkward. It's as if everyone, including the wonderful (and wasted) cast, conspired to snuff what little comedic potential there may have been in the script. As a supposed satire of mystery novels, the film is obliged to be more clever than the average novel it parodies, yet there is nothing remotely clever about the plot (if it can be said to have a plot), and makes no sense whatsoever, on any level. It was painful enough to sit through a cable channel broadcast. It seems a crime to ask anyone to actually pay for the ordeal."
5,FAST shipping!,"Good price - got here in GREAT time, even with super saver shipping... The movie is hysterical and timeless."
5,great,"i used to watch this movie all the time when i was growing up. since i grew up in germany, it took me a bit to find out the original title of it. my husband finally bought it for me for christmas. i already watched it twice. i love it, it is so funny. the quality of the dvd is great. highly recommend this"
4,Entertaining Parody,"The first time I saw this movie was in the theater with my mother. I have watched it several times since then and it can still make me laugh. This is a parody of famous literary detectives invited to dinner to solve a murder. Like other parodies (Scary Movie, Vampires Suck, Etc.) it has its funny moments and it has its cheesy moments and it has its unbelievable moments. Given it is a parody then you should except that for what it is and just enjoy the movie. The movie is comprised of name actors and actresses who do a great job with the material they are given to work with. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys movies like Scary movie or Vampires Suck. Those of you who do not enjoy parody movies probably should pass on watching this one."
3,Funny Enough to Forgive Its Stupid Moments,"The satire to end all satires. It takes a real murder mystery fan to appreciate all the nuances, but it's pretty funny. It's also very, very silly.Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) invites a group of famous fictional detectives to his spooky old mansion for ""dinner and a murder."" So we have Sam Diamond (Peter Falk), Jessica Marbles (Elsa Lanchester), Milo Perrier (James Coco), Dick and Dora Charleston (David Niven and Maggie Smith), and Sidney Wang (Peter Sellers), as satires of Sam Spade, Miss Jane Marple, Hercule Poirot, Nick and Nora Charles, and Charlie Chan. Then there is Alec Guinness as the blind butler and Nancy Walker as the deaf and dumb maid. The jokes get pretty tacky with this lot, as you can imagine. And don't expect the plot to make any sense.Nevertheless, it is a ""can't help laughing"" kind of movie."
5,A Must Have Movie!,I was very pleased with this DVD. It's an excellent addition to any satire/mystery lover's collection. Hilarious dialogue and outstanding actors throughout the film.
4,Classic comedy!,I remember watching this movie as a kid and loving it. I Watched it on my Blu-ray and it was great.
4,"Movie- excellent- DVD release- lacking, think about VHS","The movie is an excellent spoof of all the mystery detectives that hold out vital bits of information until the final pages....I'm not a huge Neil Simon fan but this one is just plain fun. It helps that I grew up reading Christie, watching the Thin Man movies, etc.Potential purchasers should be aware, though, that the DVD release isn't remastered that well, and in fact scenes are cut that are present in the video! Scenes that, in my opinion, are among the funniest in the movie.Buy the DVD for an archival copy of a great movie if you like; but you may want to find a used VHS copy for the full movie experience."
3,An Amusing Gathering of Sleuths,"The last time I saw this movie during it's original theatrical run back in 1976 (3 or 4 times actually) when I was a kid. I thought it was the funniest movie I had ever seen. I revisited it on DVD recently for the first time since then and my enthusiasm for it has waned some. It's still a very funny picture. Most of the jokes are hit or miss, but there's enough there to justify a recommendation. Peter Falk and Peter Sellers are the standouts in a uniformly good comic cast. I certainly like this infinitely better than the more ""serious"" comedies Neil Simon wrote for Marsha Mason (""Goodbye Girl"", please!)."
4,Your Laugh Till You Die!,"This is without a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. If you watch it over and over you will catch somthing new each time. The characterizations of fictional detectives from years ago is dead on, pardon the pun. There is not a weak member of the cast, each does their level best and such a cast of recognizable faces too. If you want a great movie that will continue to hold your attention viewing after viewing, get Murder by Death, you'll laugh till you.......die? Ha!"
5,personal top #10,If you haven't had the chance to see it then trust me and please buy it! Laughs are assured!!
5,Murder by Death - DVD,"Wow, love this movie! What a great spoof on all the different 'who done it' movies and characters!"
5,Still a great film,"Murder by Death has been seen by millions of renters since Blockbuster has been around, and just recently (the past couple of years) they have sold their stock off. Fortunately though the DVD transfer of the original is great, and the movie holds up quite well. If you have found memories of the movie, or simply enjoy whodunits of the past century, buy this film."
3,a bit disappointing but still worth a look,"I bought this film because I already had THE CHEAP DETECTIVE and since both were written by Neil Simon and had good actors like Peter Falk, Eileen Brennan, David Niven, Maggie Smith, Peter Sellers, Alec Guinness, etc, I thought it would be as good as CHEAP DETECTIVE, maybe even better. But MURDER BY DEATH is a bit disappointing despite the great cast. Truman Capote wasn't particularly impressive as an actor, one can only hope this was his single acting role. Still MURDER BY DEATH is worth a look and for fans who haven't seen THE CHEAP DETECTIVE, it might be satisfying. I recommend watching MURDER BY DEATH first because it plays a bit like a dress rehearsal for the other film even though only a few of the same actors appear in both."
4,FUNNY MOVIE,"This Movie Is OMG FUNNY. I Have Only Laughed Like This A Few Times In My Life, But WoW This Was Great Stuff"
3,Murder By Death Review,"I must've done my research incorrectly: I was looking for movies that starred Madeline Kahn (love her!!) and this movie came up... I thought I saw Madeline's name with the movie detail but when I got it I learnt that she's not in this movie at all... Must've been a ""something else you make like"" type thing. It's lucky I also like Maggie Smith. :-)"
4,Hilarious 1970s whodunnit spoof.,"Murder By Death is a must-see whodunnit spoof. Several famous detectives and their companions are invited to a murder mystery weekend hosted by the eccentric Lionel Twain. Each detective tries to solve the mystery before the weekend ends hoping to walk away with the cash prize, or at least his/her life. Hilarious! Ensemble cast includes Peter Falk, Peter Sellers, Alec Guinness, Nancy Walker."
3,Nice...low key comedy.,"Cute movie....great actors in an unusual configuration. The Pink Panther Movies with Peter Sellers are better; if you've not seen these actors together, here's your chance....maybe I viewed it on a bad day; it wasn't as funny as I expected."
3,Everything but the kitchen sink,"This is one of those movies that has ""everything"", in which a collection of talented actors get together to jam in a mystery/comedy. It is a classic because of its genre and who is in it, but I did not think it was one of the great comedy classics. By way of comparison I recently watched Clockwise with John Cleese which I thought was much funnier, even if it only had one simple plot and one famous actor."
1,"High expectations, MAJOR let down","well I really expected this to be a funny movie, given the reviews as well as the stellar cast. But, aside from a couple of SMALL laughs and the surprise ending, this movie is a DUD. The jokes and the plot both fall flat. Ugh I wish I hadn't wasted my time on this one. Major disappointment!!!"
5,Happy with what I got!,"I'd just like to say that I was very pleased with my order, it was in good condition (new as stated) and was glad that it came quicker than the estimated time arrival. Thank you! I used to see this movie with my little brother when we were younger and was surpised it was on DVD, it took me back in time.-Maria-"
5,4 great moves...ONE GREAT PRICE!,I originally was looking for just beerfest (because it is the best of the 4) but when I happend upon this I knew it was a far better option than beerfest alone! These are all great comedies!
4,Clear and to the point,"This is an excellent textbook for an introductory course in Real Analysis. The text is rigorous, but contains enough examples to be readily understood. If you honestly want to learn the subject matter, this book is worth the money. However, if you would rather struggle with it, there are plenty of those books floating around . . ."
1,This movie is terrible,"I was looking forward to watching this on DVD because I missed it in the theater, but I got really close to turning it off during the movie. It's just boring, there's no good story, no good acting, nothing worth seeing in my opinion. It's really silly and unbelieavable but not even a fun watch. I would not reccomend spending any money on this movie, and if you get it as a gift, return it and watch something else."
2,"High Def, What?","Purchased this,wasted money. If your gonna release high def movies(sony),shouldn't they be high def? There is way too much grain on this disc and when there isn't the picture is 'soft'. When I say soft I mean not much details, especially in 'face' shots(don't get me wrong there are some bright spots on the disc). Love the high def format alot but studios need to make sure we are getting just that on every release and not rush these things to market just to make a quick profit(the format is about the 'DETAILS'). If you do it right the 1st time you'll find us coming back for more without hestitation, without having to go to sights like highdefdigest reading reviews to make sure the video quality is OK."
2,XXX,"The problem with this tepid movie is Rob Cohen (the skateboardingfourteen year old teenager's favourite)he makes action films for for skipnot fans who don't shave and live in suburbia! If this movie was made for a more adult audience, it could have been good. As for Vin Disel, he is capable of much much more. Apart from Pitch Black and ElDiablo ( before it was turned into A Man Apart)he comes off as a member of The ATeam! The baddies are sterotyped euro trash with greasy hair in toe. In future Mr Disel should make R rated movies, period. 007 don't worry, don't worry at all, you are the best secret agent!"
3,Low-Brow Bond,"... in the sum of its parts, XXX -- with its dynamic camerawork and non-stop pyrotechnics displays -- amounts to little more than a high octane stunt movie, at best a guilty pleasure and at worst a low-brow Bond rip-off. However, with a reasonably successful box office and the bright future for a sequel, this could turn into a very successful film franchise for Vin Diesel.Plot not included."
4,All the fun and action no mush,"This movie is like a study of Bond and Bourn ""The Bourne Identity (TV Miniseries) (1988)"", action movies. Toss in the innocent enthusiasm as in ""If Looks Could Kill (1991)"", There are gadgets women plots and sub plots. But this movie is mostly about action. This is not one of those thinking movies or really a talkie. It does hold your attention.Xander Cage is an innocent dissident minding his own business. The business being stealing the governor's car and displaying reckless abandonment all in the cause of freedom. He is pressed into serves ala ""Remo Williams - The Adventure Begins (1985)"" in lieu of a prison sentence. It seems that the NSA needs someone of his reputation and abilities for short time. Will he comply and if so how short of a time? Will he quit when he is told to do so? And is there a love interest or just one of those ""spy vs. spy"" things?Remo Williams"
2,It was alright the first time...,"The second time sucked though. The movie has action for the first few parts, but then it slows to a crawl. The first 20 minutes or so of the movie are really boring. As soon as we learn about Anarchy 99, the movie slows down. Seriously, when the movie isn't in an action scene it is crap. I would write more, but I don't want to waste my time."
1,Stupidiest agent movie ever made,"This movie is literally a copy of James Bond movie.The only diffirence is the agent who tries to be a ""cool""(skater,action renegade,trash talking,...) agent in the name of being the ""new age agent"".Vin Diesel totally ... .The movie is tried to be an original one by having a close-to-teenage guy,who is totally stupid.The story is probably one of the most senseless ones in the movie world.Who would like the destroy all the governments so everyone could be free,by poisioning the world?For the ones still interested in this movie and want to know about this movie:a movie that lacks everything to be a good agent classic.I think Vin Diesel and this movie's makers should watch more James Bond before they shoot the next one."
5,excellent,I just watched this for the first time last night and I am glad I bought it. I will watch it again and again. Excellent movie.Can't wait for the second one
3,entertaining,"Mindless action, the storyline is lame at best and the acting is the cornerstone of what will become a Vin Dieselesque performance that you will expect to be cloned many times in the near future. As for the action and effects, most of the things going on you know for sure are not possible and fairly far fetched to believe with a heavy dependence on computer generated and blue screen effects.I sometimes wish I could be 6 years old again in mindset so I could really enjoy films like this. I remember watching Tom and Jerry and it was the greatest thing in the world because I could care less what the storyline was, i just wanted to see things blow up and get beaten to a pulp.To sum up XXX in a sentence...Its an adult cartoon with a script written just above the skill of a XXX movie writer but with a big budget for a who's hot now actor and plenty of effects to keep the whole trailer park entertained."
1,WHY????,"I watched this from a projection booth window. The theatre was filled with young kids (10 to 17). This new ""hero"" is not worth two cents. He can't act and all he knows is violence and we wonder why animals eat their young. This movie serves NO purpose except to promote hate and violence and give our screwed-up youth more sick ideas. I really believe that this new Hollywood is filled with hate and is sending a really bad message to our future leaders of our country. There are plenty of stories that movies can be made about, but this one is pure trash. Bad acting, bad music score (if you can call it a music score) bad directing and the list goes on. And then we wonder why the United States kids are so violent. There is only one thing to blame,,,,,HOLLYWOOD!"
3,"Likeable Cast, Lukewarm Movie","The cast is likeable, but the movie is lukewarm (at best). Vin Diesel comes across as a tough but likeable guy, somewhat like Steven Seagal. His acting is pretty good, too. However, the movie lacks in most other respects. Even the special effects look contrived (and some are rather poor) and expected. It was only borderline watchable, which surprised me because of some of the reviews I had read. One said that it ""seems to be inspired by video games"". I would agree. However, I would rather play a video game than watch a film inspired by them."
5,Great movie,"This movie has everything..great star, great villain, great story and wonderful special effects. I loved it!!! Saw it twice."
1,No way,"Xtremely Unoriginal, Xtremley Boring, Xtremely Bad Acting.After the first 5 minutes i wanted to leave. This movie was that bad. Vin Diesel is anything but inconspictuous, and could never be a believable spy. The Human Muscle would whisper and his bass drop would echo the entire missle silo before he even knew it.This was more like a comedy on spy movies.This movie was flat out bad. Vin Diesel Cannot act, he is a disgrace to movies. Arnold Should beat his bald ass for stepping foot onto a set and trying to make a good action movie. So far his best role was in Saving Private Ryan. :)"
1,"XXX-tra boring, XXX-tra dull,.XXX-tra yawns","A ho-hum ""hero"" goes against a boring villain.Yay.Stuff blows up just like in every other action movie there is.Yawn.So where's the excitement?What happened to the plot?Why'd the actors waste their time in this dud?Perhaps they were desperate for fame and money?Watch this and you'll agree that this is the absolutely worst movie there ever is.If you want an exciting action film,go with ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Jurassic Park"".Don't throw your money away on ""XXX""."
1,xXx,"This movie sucks! How can you compare this movie which(I have read) is to depose all the James Bond movies particularly the latest Bond Movie Die Another Day? The Gadgets, The Bond Girl : Rosamund Pike compare to Asia Argento? This movie still cannot hold a candle to all Bond films including the latest release."
1,Holy dear God,"Where to start? How about this. Just as annoying as the super agent who knows everything. Always has the right tools to get the job done & full of witty remarks comes a story at the opposite end of the spectrum. Another attempt at the bumbling-idiot-that-just-so-happens-to-save-the-day cliche. Full of things that go fast, extreme sports refrences, & cheesy over-the-top male bravado. This attempt tries to capitalize on pop culture in every way. Without attacking a particular class of people, let's just say that this will appeal to those that don't mind shallow and mindless action movies. Everything goes boom and the day is saved. Oh yah. Now that's entertainment."
1,Bizarre and braindead,"THis movie is one of the dumbest that I have seen in a long time. It is completely lacking in sense or logic. THe beginning was cool becase of Rammstein, but it went downhill from there. Its fine for a movie to have attitude, but this was just too over the top. And the acting was pretty bad, too. No doubt that it is a showy film, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like dumb action movies."
3,Vin Diesel got shot - - twice!!,"I am not a fan of Vin Diesel, but I sat through this movie. Let me just say, seeing him get shot twice in the first 20 minutes really did a lot to improve my mood. It's not a great movie, but it's not bad. And if you don't like Vin Diesel, like me, seeing this movie will make you laugh, I promise."
2,rent don't buy,I attempted to watch this film a few different times. I could just never quite get to the end. It's not because it's a particularly bad movie in fact it's just a modern day version of James Bond... its just that it never really excited me. The one redeeming factor is the car - it really becomes a character of its own.
3,Merely Okay,The action sequences were the best part of this movie. Vin Diesel baffles me. I don't know how that man got to be such a big action star. Maybe I could have taken him seriously if he hadn't been wearing McCloud's old coat.
4,"AWESOME action, but NOT good dialog!!!","I love the way the action sequences are repeated in slow motion so as to get every angle of the stunt. The dialog, at times, fell a little short of having any meaning to it. But with that said, NOT many movies DO have meaningful dialog, I didn't punish it for that either. Overall, this movie is very exciting and if you like action movies then...WHY DON'T YOU HAVE THIS ONE YET? It is action packed!!! NOT nearly as bad as others have said."
1,Dumb,"I was so dissappointed. What a stupid movie. I could only watch about 30 minutes of it before hitting the eject button. Since they don't have half stars, divide my rating by 2."
4,Delivers TONS of action but not much else,"This past summer I went to see ""XXX"" and was pleasantly surprised. I thought that Rob Cohen was going to just make another action movie interrupted by an attempt at making a coherent story. XXX didn't do that though. The movie does not take itself seriously as the dialogue shows. However the film has some great action sequences and plenty of them. That is where this movie gets the four stars from me. The actors in the movie did a good enough job of moving the film along from action scene to action scene which is good enough for a film like this. If you are an action junkie then give this movie a rent to see if you like it. If you are looking for a movie that'll make you think do a 180 and don't see this one."
2,"I Didn't Have High Expectations, But Honestly!","Now, this movie seemed right up my alley. I was looking for a blockbuster, throwaway popcorn flick. Bang Bang Shoot-Em Up. I liked the Fast and the Furious, and Vin Diesel without a shirt was worth my ticket price alone, that's the two stars. But frankly, this was BORING. VERY VERY BORING. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, if the poison has to mix first, just tell em it's been launched and blow the thing out of the water before it's mixed. Crimony didn't they just SAY that it became harmless? It's just stupid. Vin Diesel DID have some good dialogue, the script wasn't that bad, but this movie, to put it simply, is BORING."
3,Could Of Been A Little Less Grainy,"good action movie.lots of color,and in some spots it shines.some of the backgrounds in some spots could of been a little more sharper and in some spots it had too much grain in it for it to be a 4 or 5 star movie.audio was top notch with great surround sound."
3,Was not totally happy,"Was not totally happy, I didn't know it didn't come with the case, the picture was miss leading, it was luck that I still had the case for it even though my disc was missing."
3,Just don't compare XXX with 007 !,"I had never fallen sleep during an action scene in a movie but, there's always a first time ! These film makers simply set out to execute big action scenes and connect them with rather unmemorable dialogue (I seriously doubt if the catchphrase ""You got to be kidding me!"" will stand out in posterity !) You can't really call this a lousy movie but then again, trying to compare XXX to James Bond is like comparing Mountain Dew with Champagne."
1,Say WHAAAAAAA?,"First, the Fast and the Furious, now THIS? Why, oh WHY are movies this idiotic being made? Look past all of the ""eckstreeeemly kewl ackshin seeenses"" for a second (which I'm surprised didn't win an Oscar for 'Best Animated Movie') and you'll find a boring, badly-acted, hard-to-follow [mimic] of Bond. If you like this movie, ask yourself this: If Barbra Streisand leaped out of an exploding Jeep from 50,000 feet up in ""Yentl"", would you like that too? I rest my case.Feel free to click 'Not Helpful' now."
2,It's not a good movie,"XXX starts off with an exciting, total action-packed blast of a beginning, slowly begins to sag, gets awsome again for about 9 minutes, then sags and never manages to become the least bit interesting or exciting again. I also didn't like the fact that it became WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much like James Bond films and it does not live up to any of the hype it got. It fails on most levels, and succeeds on only a few, if that. Rent it, but don't expect too much. Vin does pretty good, though."
3,4 Words and a sentence,Fun. Juvenile. Action-packed. Loud.It's everything you expect it to be and less.
3,New School vs. Old School,"Although this is one of the most hyped movies of the summer it still can't compare to Bond, James Bond. The director's intent in making this film was for the audience to never be bored, he accomplished that but the film lacks the same punch given by Bond. ""The new breed of secret agent"" will never be able to replace Bond."
1,Triple Cheese,"This is possibly the worst movie of the year. Let's just forget for a moment the outlandish stunts that are for the most part, absolutely impossible and not even close to believable. Let's focus on the writing. This is just a poorly written movie. It's cheesy and disgustingly predictable. It's a great movie for people who don't like movies with content."
3,XXX,"Let me use an analogy for this. When you want to see naked people and/or sex but don't want to waste time on something like a plot you watch porn. ""XXX"" is that but for those who want to see an action movie. Nothing real believable or captivating here, just a lot of stuff blowing up and people getting shot. That is pretty much ""XXX"" in a nutshell."
1,Pathetic Attempt at Bond,"This film is awful. The plot is a twisted Bond-film scenario with only difference being that Disel isn't a professional spy, but recruited by the US Government because he appears to be tough and, at the same time, a criminal. The special effects were okay, but very predictable and hardly believable. The film also had some lines from previous Bond films, and even some screen shots that looked awfully similar to some of the past Bond movies. But Diesel is no Bond. He ... as a spy, and is an awkward actor at that."
2,XXX,"This movie is just like a James Bond wannabee, the cars the gadgets , are all copied from some James Bond movies. I am an avid fan of James Bond movies and I am not saying that I being a James Bond fan is bias in commenting this movie, but this movie and all its cast & characters still cannot hold a candle to all the James bond movies."
1,<*** This movie is BAD! ****>,"I was able to see this movie in Europe for free and let me just say it was terrible; big explosions, and big stunts are the only dosis you'll be getting, because as far as a good story or a bit of acting is concerned not a chance!...unless showing off your muscles every second can be call acting.Vin Diesel is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, I wish Hollywood would give a chance to real actors who are just waitingfor the opportunity.Please don't allow this to continue, bad movies must be stopped once and for all.Rent this movie if it makes you happy but don't be another victim, or worst yet another supporter of this movie."
1,xXxtremely Awful,"This could have been a Patrick Swayzee flick made for the USA Network. Vin Diesel does what he can with what little he's got to work with here, but he's a star who deserves a much better vehicle than this. Cheesey as can be, bad, no, HORRIBLE acting and worst of all... very mean spirited. At one point, the villans turn on a group of scientists who've made a toxic nerve gas for them and from behind the safety of a thick, glass wall, use that weapon to kill the scientists and mock their deaths, pretending to choke and gag and plead for help while laughing at the dying victims. It's unbelievably sadistic and violent for a PG-13 movie.....On a positive note though, the soundtrack is awesome. Seriously."
1,One of the WORST movies ever made,"Bad acting, unbelivable action shots, terrible dialogue, no plot, what more can I say than xxx is a waste of money and time."
2,Very Cliche (2.5 Stars),"[I was very torn between giving this movie 2 or 3 stars, so I decided on a 2.5 rating] This movie isn't as great as it was hyped up to be. Right after seeing it, I thought it was really good! But then once all the excitement died down, I realized that this movie pretty much stunk. It was very predictable. I mean, you know that Vin Diesel's character is going to save the world, and that he's going to get the girl. James Bond has nothing to worry about, since any of the Bond movies are better than this flick. It's worth a peak, but it's not a movie I would go out and buy. Sure it has a lot of action, but just action doesn't make a movie. The plot is unoriginal and not that exciting. I think I kind of forced myself to like this because the kids I saw it with thought it was ""so tight"" but actually it's not. So, if you're looking for a cheesy action movie, you've found it here! Not that highly recommended. ... Enjoy... well, maybe not..."
1,Ugggg!,"My wife said it best ""this movie is for teen age boys"". Sure there's lots of action and stuff blowing up all over the place. Some great effects, although a bit far fetched in the reality department. But the acting... yikes. Diesel takes the 'wood' grammy away from Keanu. They should have given him a role like AAAH-NOLD in Terminator... very few lines. And the female lead...I guess shes good if you're into ""heroin"" chic.Puullllease! I guess some people liked it though...possibly the same people who think pro wrestling is a sport!"
2,Action over Dialogue Anyone?,"Okay, for some, this will be a great movie. I remember, as a teen, watching Stallone and enjoying many a movie where it was all about action and not about plot, character or acting. For the next generation, here is Vin Diesel. He is not James Bond, but maybe James Bond's younger, American second cousin. Sure, he used some spy stuff, but for the most part, XXX uses ESPN Extreme Sports moves to make his plans work out okay.For the rest of us, this movie is not a good option. It actually got a little boring watching scene after scene staged just to show off another ""stunt."" Perhaps if the pyrotechnics budget had been diminished just a tad and reinvested in a decent screenwriter and acting coach, this could have been a boxoffice blockbusting series in the making. Unfortunately, it is not."
1,"Mindless, Pointless and Insulting","Bad. Just plain awful. Please skip this mindless drivel. The only people who liked this film are girls who think that Vin Diesel is ""cute"" and people who liked ""Fast & The Furious"" (another snoozer). I am glad that I saw it on my friend's PC and not at the theaters, so that I didn't waste $7.50. Anyone who watched this film and was not insulted by its mindnumbing dialogue, horrid plot and overall crudeness should be ashamed of themselves. Not even Jean Claude himself could have saved this one. A total waste of time for the thinking movie goer. Hey kiddies, here's an idea; instead of watching this why not see a top-notch film like ""Far From Heaven"" or ""The Hours"" or even ""Minority Report""? Oh, thats right, gotta use the old noggin for that one....never mind. It saddens me that movies have come to this."
1,head for the XXX-it,"I've only ever walked out of one movie, and this was it. I actually stayed for an hour, hoping it'd get better...but it actually got worse. The acting: bad, the stunts: bad, the plot: VERY bad. I wouldn't wish seeing this movie on my worst enemies (even thogh I have none). Save your money, send it to Sally Struthers or something."
1,watch a test pattern instead,"I paid good money for this thing so i can say what i like.This movie is suppose to put bond movies to shame,mission:failure.It copies every thing from those movies and still bites the big one.I love pointless action and unbelievable stunts but these are plain stupid.The only reason to watch is asia argento and her tattoo mmmmmmmm.vin diesel cant save this junk."
3,ehhhh not bad,"Call it what you will, it's an entertaining movie (the first time you see it). Especially towards the end. =)"
2,"It's ""ok""...","""XXX"" could be considered a mix of ""James Bond"" and ""The Saint"" with a little extra muscle added in to give it that macho feel.This movie isn't all that bad, however, I would have liked to see a bit more action involved. In certain parts of this film it tends to become slow and boring, and the action sequences are nothing spectacular.If you plan on seeing this film for the first time, go ahead and rent it before you purchase it."
1,::::shakes head:::::,"First of all, I know Vin Diesel can act, I've seen him do so in other movies. I just don't know why he can't act in this one . . . I blame it on poor directing. If he's going to be this bad in the rest of his movies, he should pull a Fast and the Furious and keep the lines to a bare minimum of monosyllables such as ""yes"" and ""no,"" ""sure"" ect, ect. The only reason I would buy this movie is because he takes his shirt off, and he is HOTTT! Although the shirtless scene only lasted all of ten seconds, it was well worth waiting and hour into movie to see it. Now, if he had just kept his shirt off for the whole movie, or at least pranced around in one of his ""Pitch Black"" black tank tops, the whole thing would have been more enjoyable."
4,Exciting and well written action flick,"I saw XXX: State of the Union before watching this, so I wasn't surprised by Xander's death. What did surprise me was how lame ""The Death of Xander"" sequence was. It made no sense. The way they worked around not having Vin Diesel play the role in the short was creative though.This really could have been a modern James Bond movie. The opening sequences were exciting and Xander's character traits and growth were developed well. Although incredible, the action sequences in XXX are more credible than some in State of the Union. Sorry they killed XXX off. It would have been interesting to bring him back for a cameo in XXX-3.I'm not sure how the Uncensored Unrated Director's Cut differed from the theatrical release, but I'd definitely recommend it to all action and secret agent movie fans."
5,Easily The Best FIlm of The Last 50 years,"Coppola. Scorcese. Spielberg. Kubric.Decades upon decades of cinematic evolution have left the movie going public with...Vin Diesal!xXx not only lived up to my expectation, but surpassed them tenfold. I saw the movie because i had this feeling it was going to be terrible. Not only was it terrible, but far worse than I ever expected.So why five stars? Well it was entertaining to see the current state of what people like me call ""mainstream garbage"". I laughed pretty hard on more than one occassion. Also, to people that don't know any better, this really is a five star film. But who am I to disagree? Vin is clearly the best thing that has happened to the matinee since Marlon Brando."
1,Awful,"Vin Diesel was awful in this movie. He couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. the fast and furious was over the top and entertaining. Diesel was good in that flick. XXX was a lot of pointless action, no character or story development and unbelieve stunts. a lot of things happened with no real reasoning to why. Stay away. do not waste 2 hours on this one."
1,Bad....very bad,"This movie is not worth renting, let alone buying. I returned it to the video store right away because I would rather get charged for a late return on adult movies than this one. It would have been much better if it were shorter and could have benefited from some editing. It would also help if there was at least some realism within the action scenes. I mean motorcycles just don't jump 20 feet off the ground without a ramp or something. Do not get me wrong I love action films but this one just crossed the line one too many times. The action was just not believable, but if you like that then who knows maybe you will like this one. I am not putting my name on this review for fear of people knowing I even rented this. Beware...consider this a warning."
5,AWESOME!,Wow! This movie is a must see for every action fan. the acting is really good and there is non-stop action. If you are a Vin Diesil fan watch this!! It is one of his best movies yet. If you liked this you would also like one of vin diesil's other movies called Pitch Black. This is a must see for everyone. Don't miss out on it!
2,James Bond as Sluggo!,"Okay, they blow stuff up real good in this one. So I'll give it 2 stars for stunts and pyrotechnics. And it gets itself over with quickly enough and doesn't waste too much of your time, so another 1/2 star. And if you're of a certain age, this tatoopiercedmuscledtuffguy might appeal as he swaggers about doing nastyforeignhipbadguys and foxybabesluthos. That it adopts the dopey James Bond quips and archaic attitude to women is just part of the genre I guess. Anyway, mindless noisy fun, forgotten the minute it's over. Diesel's act could fade fast."
3,As a movie; 1 star - The Soundtrack; 5 stars ++,"The story/script? -zero. -Absolutely NO surprises, -terrible predictable all the way through! And; -just one or two of about 30 ""funny"" one-liners where funny. The acting? where there any actors involved in this production?Vin has the charm, but isn't much of an actor. Then again, I don't think this is the movie to judge his capacity as an actor... -Even Jackson couldn't save this script. -That is actually quite an achivement; -to make Jackson seem like a bad actor... My favourite character is actually the young ""office-agent"" coming to deliver all the ""mrQ""-gadgets.But the soundtrack is worth going to a cinema several times! Be sure to pick a THX-theatre!! -It's a knockout!"
2,Thought I'd love it...I thought wrong.,"Boy was I disapointed. This film had no character developement, no real ""set up"", and the stunts were ridiculous. This seemed more of a 007 ""wanna be"", and 007 Vin Diesel is not. I watched the enitire film waiting for it to get better, it didn't. I would rent this before buying it, if I were you."
1,Unleaded,"Probably one of the most pointless films with one of the most pointless stars of today....and the best thing is we can expect a sequel. Could someone please explain to me the appeal of Vin? I mean, he did show some promise in far superior films like Pitch Black and Saving Private Ryan but enough already."
1,Triple Bad!!!,"This movie doesn't even deserve one star. Vin Diesel is the worst actor. For ANYBODY to call him the ""new James Bond"" is sad and laughable. Say what you want about Roger Moore's performances as James Bond, Vin Diesel could NEVER compare to him and he was the worst James bond ever!! The stunts in this movie are awesome, but the acting and plot is HORRIBLE!! I felt ashamed that I watched this movie because it insulted my intelligence. This movie was SO bad and to think it was a block buster hit!!! Vin is sexy (although he sometimes force it), but nothing and I do mean NOTHING should excuse him for making this mess. C'mon Vin, do better next time!!"
1,Just Bad,"I will make it short, about half way through the movie I turned it off. Probably one of the worst movies I have ever watched in my life. I didn't expect much from the acting to begin with, but it was worse than I could have imagined. Let's just say, I hope this is the last of this franchise."
4,excellent movie,"this had to be to be one of the best movies with not to many flaws. the action part was great and the gun was super cool. the only flaw was all the extreame sports part. the jump off the car was cool, but grinding down a rail with a dinner platter,? come on! over all the movie was very good."
3,XXX for Action & CCC for Plot,"Vin Diesel is the man and is on a roll. He rocked in ""Fast & The Furious"" and made ""Pitch Black"" & ""Boiler Room"" somewhat amusing. As for ""XxX"" the movie gets my double points on the awesome action stunts I have NEVER seen blew me away but the mediorce plot...aaahhh...ummm thats another story I'll over look."
5,"Vin Diesel & Asia Argento (beautiful woman), X is hit!","i have to say that the motion picture has an interesting plot. Xander Cage (Diesel) goes up against a russian mob that goes by the name of ""anarchy 99"" and Xander along with Russian CIA Agent Yelena (Asia Argento)have to stop this evil gang of men who want tyranny and chaos in all the world, and who want to destroy Prague Czechoslovakia.the movie has action, great acting by Vin Diesel Asia Argento Samuel Jackson and other actors. the scenes are very realistic, and one who sees this movie will see the nice city of Prague.there is nothing cheezy about this film, one has to...see it to enjoy the film and ignore the critics."
2,"Wants to be James Bond, but he isn't","As an action movie, it just isnt quite enough. It tries hard, pulling all the usual strings, but aside from the avalanche scene (which is worth seeing), the rest is pretty predictable and boring."
2,complete sxxxt,"I have a bad habit of buying films before i see them and sometimes it pays off. Donnie darko, trainng day and memento to name just a few but then you get that film that is so awful, your embarressed to have it in your dvd collection. This is that film. To summarise: Worst storyline of any action film ever, some of the worst acting i have ever seen,Vin diesel is awful as an an action hero and it is shot very badly as well making it look [bad]. Stay away form this [movie] unless you are an american, as apparently they like this sort of [thing]."
2,uneXXXcusable,"Vin Diesel is a great actor, as is shown in this movie (though some of his aesthetics were a bit overdone). The action scenes were entertaining. But that's about it. First off, the first 30 minutes were supposed to set up the story, but the plot was hard to follow. So that left me to guess what would happen in the rest of the movie, and that's where it got terribly predictable: guy meets tough girl, they fall in love, guy finds out she's ""one of them"" (the villians), girl says she really isn't, guy and girl get the villians and save the day. If you like action films, think twice before seeing this flick."
1,OH MY GOD!!!,"This is the first time I write a review, so what made me do it: is this PEACE OF CRA* OF A MOVIE, so please save your money, buy any thing else just don't buy this movie."
1,AWWWWWWFULLLLLLLL,"THIS MOVIE WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT, VERY UNREAL, JAMES BOND MOVIES ARE WAY BETTER"
5,XXX,I'm a huge Vin Diesel fan. So i think it's amazing that he is in another film and i can't wait to see it!!!
5,Talented.....Athletic......and hot!,"These are just a few of the words that describe Xander ""XxX"" Cage (aka Vin Diesel). The movie was great, the graphics were off the hook....The sound track was bangin' and the sequal, I hope, will include him and the rest of the cast members."
1,Some one please kill me!,"""some one please kill me"" was what i was thinking during the film in the middle of the film and at the end. I really couldnt be bothered to watch the end it was so bad i was just pointing out all the mistakes in the movie i dont count this as a film because most films have a plot. Anyway what im trying to say is that my step mothers funeral was more interesting than this film"
1,apallingly appalling,"This film could really be summed up in one word ""Appalling"". Van Diesel plays the archetypical 'action hero.' Yeah you've got it, the one whose status is big muscles and has 'I can't act' written all over his face! The trailer for the film looked absolutely awesome, which is the only 30 seconds worth watching for the entire film.I would love to explain in depth the details of the plot, but quite frankly I was too busy laughing at how pathetically shallow the plot was to even remember it.If you are a Samual L Jackson fan don't torture yourself by sitting through the film, not even the master himself can do it any justice whatsoever.Nevertheless as taste is unaccountable I can only recommend you rent this film from your local video rental store or whomever!"
5,NEW DEFINITION OF MAN-POWER!!!,"...rob cohen profed already,to make FAST movies.vin diesel pitched us to black and this right fast&furiously;!!now what do you expect XXX will do???yes-it will blast us away.no more questions about vin diesel,he`s not just acting,he display emotions for everyone!join XXX - so i will do... thx ;-)"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!,"Well i saw this movie on the night of its release... Just like most women in this world I am a HUGE VIN DIESEL fan... I saw him in the Fast and the Furious, Pitch Black, Boiler Room,and so on. I was SADLY DISSAPOINTED by this movie. It was long and dry. The funny parts were few and far between, and there was sooo much action in it that it was almost UNBEARABLE to watch. Between the mediocre acting and the tired fighting scenes. It leaves u drained. NOT VIN DIESELS FINEST HOUR I WILL SAY.."
1,Stunts cool? (Someone DIED for your amusement)!,"For those of you ""ranting"" about how cool the stunts were in this piece of ... movie you should know the truth; one of the stunt doubles for Vin Diesel was killed in the paragliding scene. His name was Harry O'Connor. Knowing this fact will probably make you ... think this movie is even more cool."
4,Finally...An exciting action flick,"The James Bond of the new milliniem, Xander Cage is adrenalin seeking junkie who often finds himself on the wrong side of the law. Persuaded by the US government to participate in a top secret underground mission in exchange for his freedom, Xander is off to Prague to try and foil an attempt by a rogue Russian terrorist to save the world. Sounds simple...it is! Sounds like its been done a hundred times before...it has!But all the entertainment is in the action and stunts. While they are all unbelievable, Rob Cohen directs a highly addictive action movie that leaves everything else for dead. While Vin Diesel may not light up the screen (females will tend to disagree), most of his scenes are done by a stunt double, his performance as Xander does enough to warm the audience to him. Martin Szorkas plays a very good 'bad guy'. The ending was a bit of an anti-climax but still satisfying."
4,"""Silent Night""","A pleasant surprise, XXX, brings to the screen the story of an extreme sports athlete that breaks the law and is given the choice to either go to prison or carry out a covert operation for the NSA in Prague, in the Czech Republic.Vin Diesel, Samuel Jackson and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well allowing for an entertaining movie.The setting, the plot, and the music are above average, but the dialogues could have been a lot better.In short, though not a masterpiece, XXX is a movie worth watching, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment. 3 1/2 Stars"
3,"Great Special Effects, Not very believable.","Vin Diesel is a daredevil that has a choice, either go to jail or help the NSA foil the plan of Anarchy 99', a group of Russian turned anarchists that are planning on destroying the world. Diesel performed excellent in his role in this movie. Nonetheless this movie got 3 stars from me because the actions scenes, though they had great special effects were very ridiculous. In one scene he snowboards faster then expensive snowmobiles that can travel 100mph while being chased by an avalanche. He then jumps and grabs on to a power line which holds up to an avalanche that just knocked down buildings. I mean, come on. If your just looking for an action packed movie and don't care how out of this world the stunts are then this movie is for you. But if your tired of Bond movies then I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
2,XXX - Review on the actual Blu-Ray,"First off, I like the film. But... the blu-ray is disappointing. The clarity is not what I expected and no better than the DVD. In a word, grainy. So, if you got the film on DVD, just keep than and enjoy a fun action film. The blu-ray has no further special features or anything else special."
2,Best actor!,"Vim Diesel is even a worse actor than Richard Gere! He should consider to work as a doorman again!! I give it 2 stars, because sometimes I am to lazy to think at the movies. So brainless entertainement is sometimes quite fun."
2,horrible story line,This movie is a good one to rent if there isnt anything else u have to watch. The story line is bad. U can guess what is going to happen all the time. Do not buy this movie
2,Lame acting with some good action. Rent it - Don't buy it.,"I would rate this movie as just ""Interesting"". The acting is terrible and I started to get tired of all the one liners. Vin Diesel did an ok job for a B-Actor, but the supporting actors acting was laughable. It reminded me of the cheesy robo-cop movies. I found the action on par and pretty good. Better than high profile movies such as Mission Impossible 2 (Although, the motorcycle stunts are quite far fetched.) This movie was interesting to watch, but just that. It was ok to watch once, but I wouldn't buy it."
3,Blasting Action with an unlikeley surprise,"What was the surprise? Well, I went to the theatre expecting adrenaline, adventure and action... and little else. But I was pleasantly surprised, both by the storyline and the decent performances of the actors. Diesel is an unusual spy -- super only in that he's natural and does it HIS way. ""If you're going to send someone to save the world, make sure they like it the way it is..."" or something like that. He may not like the world he is saving but he takes doing his mission to the extreme... and that is obviously the part that his character, x-sports freak that he is, gets the most out of.It may not be an intellectual thriller or the most amazing story you could ever imagine... but it is pure entertainment and don't try and take it for anything else. Bravo."
4,And XXX marks the spot,I took a chance with XXX expecting it to be just an average run of the mill movie but this film turned out to be much better than I thought. It may not be the best action movie in the world but just for my two cents it's a very good movie.Vin Diesel stars as the lawless stuntsman Xander XXX Cage who is recruited by secret agenst to thwart the mad schemes of a Czech madman who uses a deadly agent called Silent Night because the deadly chemical is neutralized and rendered harmless by water and water vapor leaving behind no evidence of the incident. The madman plans to depopulate Prague by means of this chemical and it's up to Xander Cage aka XXX to stop the madman.Rob Cohen who directed last years awesome Fast & The Furious directs this movie so those who liked the former I think will enjoy this one too.I hope I didn't give too much away.
5,You want action? Get it here!,"What more is there to say about this fantastic Van Diesel flick? I actually bought it for my son a few weeks ago, he saw it first on Netflix and as he likes to collect the DVDs of his favorite shows, I figured I'd give him one more to add to it. He watched it at least 4 times since and just can't seem to get enough of it. The price on Amazon was excellent and certainly worth buying. No waiting around for Netflix to come in and, as it sometimes happens, not come in at all when you're in the mood for watching as certain show. BTW - I also love the movie and am glad I bought it!"
3,Functional and priced right,"My son is in Cubs Scouts and I recently had to start stocking up on gear. I was spending a lot of money and wanted to save some here and there by getting this basic mat. For what it does it does well, but comfort is not high on it's list. They are thin and light, but if you have the money and are not worried about weight, buy a self-inflating mat. IF you are a backpacker and want to minimize the weight and sacrifice some comfort...this is definitly a great buy. Why the 3 stars, I am not looking at the weight factor yet."
3,Grandpa Purchased for Grandson,"I purchased an extra long sleeping bag as a Christmas present for my grandson who is going kayak tripping June 2010. He also needed a ground barrier to go with it. There is nothing wrong with the actual construction of this product, but it was the only choice available. It is only 20 inches wide and 72 inches long. What I really needed was ground barrier that is 25 inches wide and 85 to 90 inches long. So, I was pretty disappointed with the purchase."
2,It's bulky,"For what it is, hit sleeping pad is ridiculously bulky.For car camping, I think this product is decent, though if I have the option of car camping, I think a portable cot + heat reflector (e.g. mylar blanket) is better for comfort and warmth. For backpacking, it's just way too cumbersome. I may decide to cut it as the biggest pains in sleeping in a tent is uneven ground or roots/rocks the jut up around my back and butt. My head will have the pack as a pillow and my legs aren't as easily affected, so maybe a shortened pad is all I need. But as is, this pad is not gonna cut it."
3,so-so camp pad,"It doesn't keep you any warmer, it's not especially compact and dirt and stuff sticks to it. BUT it does keep you from feeling any rocks or anything on the ground. If you just want something basic you can't beat the price."
4,Does what it claims to do,Took this pad on a boy scout camping trip. It was rainy and just above freezing. The pad helped to keep my son warm and dry. Can't comment on durability since we have not had it that long.
4,"Satisfying, light, sweet crunch!","For such a light snack, these are surprisingly tasty and satisfying. If you need a sweet to tie you over till mealtime or as a desert substitute after lunch, grab one of these and GO! Very portable, so you can eat on the go without mess or utensils. Try them!"
1,Don't buy this book,"If you are interested in learning about how to conduct option analysis, this is not the book for you. The book never provides you with the details on how to conduct the valuations described in the examples. Instead, they use over 100 pages to reiterate the same points they describe in the first 5. Furthermore, there are plenty of mistakes in the text to add to your confusion.In short, this book is a waste of time and money."
2,Not a practitioner's guide,"For me, the book was verbose, repetitive, poorly organized. Not inspiring and not recommended."
3,At least this book is readable,"The only saving grace about this book is that it is readable. However, the reason for this is because there is not much to learn about RO from this book. The author's talk about numerous examples and the ""concept"" of how RO was applied. But, you will not learn the actual process of using RO, unlike Copeland's or Trigeorgis' book."
3,real options,"it is a used book with underlines but in good condition, it is satisfying for meReal Options: Managing Strategic Investment in an Uncertain World (Financial Management Association Survey and Synthesis Series)"
3,"Clear Book, some examples are not explained","It is a cristal clear and an excelent first step-book. However, in many of the examples is not clear where the number came from. Inclusive, if you dowload the spreadsheet ...................... There are also some logical errors in the examples which cause the impresion that the authors want to over-sale the concept, and the lack of a clear logic explanation produce clear mistakes in some of the examples. Is not a quantitative book and please do not tried to use real options after read this book, it will be great if first you have a robust background in derivatives."
5,ECommerce needs a Real Options investment approach!,"Many investments in ECommerce have been postponed because management required facts about the future - which do not exist - to fit into their ROI models and mindsets. Well the Real-Options approach helps managers create business cases using the market which will validate action. We have been postponing the future, particularly in ECommerce investments for too long and this is a very important new tool in the arsenal for action! So now there will be few excuses to postpone investments today which create options for tomorrow. If you don't sow you can't expect to reap the harvest."
3,"Excellent overview, a bit off on target audience focus","This is an excellent book to get an overview of real options, IF you are already familiar with the valuation of financial options. Otherwise, you would find yourself disbelieving the valuation process, which is not very well covered here. You can't really blame the authors since this is not a book on option valuation.If you have already studied financial options, then you will find the parallels drawn to real assets very interesting & instructive. The argument that corporate management with real-options will, in the long run, be rewarded by investors, is intriguing & plausible, but not well supported in the book.In short, I would recommend this book to corporate managers who have studied financial options in college and for whom real options may not have come up before as a decision-making approach."
3,flexible player but not reliable,"I bought this because it was cheap and I knew it had the ""secret menus"". This has worked pretty good, kind of noisy like the other DVD-ROM drive based players (has a PC DVD drive in it), but it will play anything, even my homemade VCDs I make on my Mac, that I burn on CDRs. Most brand name DVD players will read VCDs on CD-RW if at all. It has problems with layer changes, just a stutter on some discs.BUT, I bought it in August and only use it 2-3 times a week and it just died. Now I get to figure out how to get warranty service on this thing, oh boy!"
3,Too small for me,"I'm sure this is a fine sleeping bag for the price. It seems to be reasonably well constructed, but I had to return it. I am 6'1"" and, despite the advertised dimensions, could barely get in this bag, much less zip it up. If you are a big and/or tall person, make sure you do your research (including checking other sources) before buying one of these mummy bags. As I've come to find out, they do come in different sizes."
5,Love Tiny!,My daughter loves Tiny! She has renamed him Perrito and she makes him play with her other stuffed animals. She received him for her birthday.
5,wonderful!,"My 2 year old son is so in love with his ""puppy"" he misses it when it gets washed so I had to order replacements in case he gets lost!"
4,Nothing compares to the smile on a child's face,Bought this as a replacement 'lovey' for my daughter. It is a perfect match to the one we bought back in 1999. Fun for the imagination of a little girl carrying around her favorite toy.
4,Tiny,"If you have seen some of my previous reviews you will see a theme with the stuffed animals. I like Ty products. I think they make some of the cutest, most quality stuffed animals on the market."
3,Overwrought and overwritten,"This is an enjoyably turgid potboiler with large pretensions. The narrator's prose mixes tough-guy cynicism with over-the-top poeticizing. The author's literary ability is always in the foreground. Several stories, each entertainingly pulpy, are interwoven, except a historical romance that remains unrelated to the main plot. While basically chronological, the organization often makes better thematic than narrative sense. The weakness of the book is that almost all of it comes off as artifice and contrivance. Only Willie Stark and Jack Burden intermittently ring true. The other characters, especially the women, are props stuffed with clichés. The plots churn with coincidences and melodramatic events. And some passages are close to camp in their laughably extravagant rhetoric."
4,A very good book,"Warren has created a book not about ""the rise and fall or an American dictator"" as one edition has written across the cover- which has deprived the novel of its due fame. ""All the King's Men"" deals with Jack Burden's inability to fathom actions have consequences and this is rather interesting. Anyone can see Warren is a very learnt and well-read author. His novel relates to Huey Long (Willie Stark) - the political figure in Lousiana although the main character is NOT Willie Stark - but Jack Burden the narrator and reporter. I found this book philosphical and well-written. It is true one can not sympathize with the protagonist who palys the role of an anti-hero. Not the most interesting but very thought-provoking. ~15 yrs."
5,A life changing read,"This novel works on layers that other novels don't even know exist. Faulkner blew it off, but I suspect few outside the university read Faulkner whereas this book, rich, powerful evocative and beautiful, is what reading is for. It changed my life; it made me realize that self is not ""found"" but created. No higher praise can I offer."
5,Classic of Southern Genre,"Will long stand as a classic of the ""good ole' boy"" south. From asphalt politics to segregation, a rich, deep view of the hey-days of the old south"
5,Above mere books as olympians are above mere athletes,"One feels after reading this book like one has lived an entire extra lifetime and now must get back to one's own life, though wiser and a little more world weary. Somehow it feels out of place to list this among other ""books"", like it's been misclassified or misslabled. This isn't a book, it's rare genius hitting on all cylinders -- a spark from the shattered vessel of the deeper truths of life."
4,Even the Queen's Ladies will like this,"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"
4,An American Classic,"Although this extremely gifted author did an excellent job, a bit wordy for me. Just dont have the time to read this style of writing."
2,Wrong one,"It was to be the restored edition with the protagonist named Talos, this one has him as Stark. So then it is the original version. Not as advertised."
4,Captivating,"Been listening to the book for the last two weeks so I feel like I'm family. Doesn't get 5 stars because it gets a little too in love with its own voice, but for the most part a really good audio book."
4,. . . Couldn't Put Penn Warren Together Again . . .,"Robert Penn Warren stretches a lovely novella into a less lovely collection of casually related short stories. The principal story is a GREAT ONE, AND one to which I kept wishing Penn Warren would return to. Those intermittent detours - Cass Mastern, Annabelle Trice, pigtailed Annie & Borax Pete - are, each of them, charming, but each intermittently detours from the story for which I bought the book - the story of Governor Willie Stark.A less tightly tailored Americanization of ""Brothers Karamazov"" with more spilt booze than blood."
4,Even stranger...,"Some time ago, I wrote a review for this book. I was then on the second reading of the book, and decided that it had no merits other than the writing style. That was earlier today. Well, I began reading again, from the beginning, and the most insane thing happened - I began loving the book. And not just that, I read for hours on end, finishing at least a quarter of the book before my first break. Still, I don't feel that this is the best book ever, and in a similar vein (as far as writing style is concerned anyway) Ulysses is much better, but then again, Ulysses is one of my all-time favourites."
4,It's NOT about Huey Long. Warren said so.,"I just want to correct one error. This book is NOT about Huey Long nor was it based on him. The author, Robert Warren stated as much."
2,Tedious,There's no doubt this novel has a good story line. The main problem I had was getting to it. I labored through so much descriptive prose that I often forgot where I was in the story. It was a chore to finish and I have come to the conclusion I should not read any more Pulitzer Prize winning novelists. This is my fourth and none have been half as good as a Glass Castle or Memoirs of a Geisha or many others with less acclaim.
5,Remarkable and breathtaking,"Warren's novel -- one of the best American novels ever written, I believe -- is beautiful and evocative, but it is only tangentially about politics and Willie Stark. It is instead primarily concerned with history; specifically, the New South and the Old South, one generation versus another, backwoods Jeffersonian agrarianism versus modern political ambition. Willie Stark is certainly an important character; it is with him, after all, that the novel reaches its violent climax. But Jack Burden, tortured former graduate student, keen observer of everyday life, is the true focus of the novel; through the course of the book, we see the world through him, and come away shaking with revelation and uncertainty."
5,Song of South,"I've read this book many times. It is bittersweet meditation on human weakness, loss, and learning the way of the world. The depth of this book is such that different themes resonate at different points of your life, like a dark gem. Penn Warren's evocation of the changeful, aching, moments of life is nothing short of masterful."
5,stick with it; it's worth it,"I definitely had my doubts while I was reading it, but now in reflection this is probably one of my three favorite novels. If you can withstand the slow first chapter, keep reading - the final chapter is nearly impossible to put down and is undoubtedly one of the most captivating and best-written chapters in American literature. DON'T read this book to learn about the political rise and fall of Willie Stark. Most reviews say that the book is about him, when the book is really about Jack Burden, the narrator. Warren at times is really amazing; his prose in countless paragraphs is as good as or better than any 20th century American novelist. The book is long, and often times slow, but it is a priceless piece of fiction, and I think it would be difficult to find an educated reader who would be disappointed in the end."
5,"The best ""serious"" novel I have read.","The descriptive passages in this text are able to take me, an Australian of this era, into the lives homes and meeting places of people of a different era and nationality.The characterisation weaves through the narrative to provide a consistency unparalled in other writings.The writer cleverly builds to the climatic and devastating discovery by the anti hero (Jack Burden) that nothing is safe (or sacred) from corruption - even his boyhead love."
5,Arguably the great American novel,"There never has been and never again will be a book like ATKM. It is, arguably, THE great American novel. Unfortunately, some view this work as a retelling of the Huey Long story but, of course, it is far more than that, for in Willie Stark, Warren has created a character both more complex and more sympathetic than Long. How greatful we all should be that Warren abandoned his play, Proud Flesh, and chose the novel format instead. I doubt the play, if produced, would ever have been successfully transformed into a novel, while the novel has generated numerous plays and a successful screenplay. With the exception of the Cass Mastern episode, which tends to drag, this work is up there with the very greatest fiction in the English language."
5,A must read,"As a visitor living here for a few years I have decided to read the cream of American Fiction.I must say in this book I struck gold.The writer seemed to have the skill to combine a hugely compelling plot,elaborate character development and prose which at times was poetic.The novel is full of timeles themes such as the greed and corruption of the body politic,sowing what one will reap and the importance of friends and roots,it is all there.This novel for me was a great discovery and I was in awe from start to finish.This is compelling reading and stands head and shoulders above some of the modern writing we are getting today.I would recommend this book to anyone.......it is a must read."
1,revised from original edition,"The one star is not really for the novel, but for this edition of it. If, like me, you have read this and are looking to purchase a copy, this has an attractive cover. However, it is not clear from the product description that this edition of the novel is in the form the author originally submitted to his editor, and not the edition originally published. Accordingly, Willie Stark is Willie Talos throughout this novel. Even though this may have been the author's original intention, I absolutely hate that it's a different edition from the novel I read and loved. I will be returning it and purchasing an older edition without this reversion."
1,Pointless,"This book was profane and pointless, as is w/ most books I'm forced to read for English. I never knew being in AP ment I had to put up with my beliefs being violated. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,Not the best book,"I have not finished this book but it is difficult to get interested in it. Parts of it make no sense to me. As a Louisianian, I know much of the history this book is based on, but it is still not easy to follow in this book. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this book."
2,Tedious,"As long as I have wanted to read this fascinating story, I just could not make my way through the author's ponderous writing style. I gave up after about 100 pages as he is one of those writers who thinks 1000 words is better than 100. I don't think I have EVER read longer sentences or longer paragraphs!!"
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!,I thought this book could have been alot better. I think he rambled on too much in the beginning. If u want to read this book I suggest Cliff notes. It is so much more to the point than the book itself.
2,"Politics, Politics, and more Politics","I found this book way too long and drawn out. Jack Burden, the narrator spent way too much time describing things. I never did get caught up in the book. I only finished it for a class. If you start reading this book and do not like the narration style, put it down. Jack Burden narrates the same way the whole time through. Not liking politics also makes it very hard to find the good things people say there are in this book."
1,WORST BOOK I EVER READ!,"This had to be the most boring book I have read in my entire life! We had to read it for school, and a majority of the class ended up just reading the cliff's notes. I do not recommend this book to anyone, except to this one pig-like girl I know. Anyway, I never want to see this book ever again. I'm going to have nightmares about it! A warning to all: Never read this book unless you have to!"
5,No exercise during this reading time.,Outstanding writing..........unbelievable. Could not quit reading it. Best book I have ever read.......and I have read thousands of books.
1,Audio edition--Warning,"The novel itself turned out to be better than I had expected it to be after listening to the first part on the audio cd set. However, the content of the novel is not the topic of this review, the audio edition is. I had been assigned the book for my Lit class and figured the audio version would help me understand the writing. However, I never even finished listening to the CDs. First of all, the narrator's voice is so gravelly and unappealing that it was a low-level version of torture to listen to. Secondly, the writing is difficult enough to follow on page, but on audio with no writing or punctuation to go from, the story is nearly impossible to follow. Unless you have no other option, go for the print version of this book- the audiobook will only frustrate you."
2,all the kings men,It was so busy of a book I felt I had to read it super fast and didn't have time for it to soak into my mind. was not happy with it.
4,Could be better,"There were a few too many stains for my taste, and there was some writing on the inside though for the price it was a great deal."
4,Great Book,"I had to purchase this book for my freshman english class, as I was required to read the whole text (14 chapters) and answer the 5 questions after each chapter for the final. This book suprisingly wasn't a burden to read as it's very small but packed with useful tips on how to improve your study skills and habits. I read the entire book and answered the questions (70 in total) after each chapter in a matter of 2 days. I already had very good study skills and habits (3.3 overall g.p.a. after my freshman year) but this book still gave me various ways of how to improve those and even brought to my knowledge things I did that I didn't even know was helping me study. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone that attends school starting from middle school and up to even people just looking to improve their overall studying."
5,The title is right. So is the premise. Plain old excellent.,"The authors opening sentence to the introduction: ""Those who seek miracles or panaceas to replace work should stop here.""; states the premise of this book clearly and without embellishment. Study is work, and, like work, it has skills that can be learned and sharpened.This small book should be purchased, read, reread, freely annnotated, and kept within reach on every reference shelf. I wish it had been available when I bought my Strunk and Whites'. I also hope someone makes this into a series of study couses for seveeral levels in our educational system."
2,Not truly 140 watts...,"I purchased this unit from a Radio Shack in town (for way too much money, might I add) and was very upset to discover that by ""140watt"" they mean ""70 watts per plug"" (the device has two AC outlets on it.) Plugging in my Dell laptop adapter (which pulls exactly 70 watts) caused the unit to overload, and it popped the fuse inside of the cigarette lighter itself. Furthermore Radio Shack wouldn't take it back because they claimed I damaged it. Anyhow, the unit feels sort of cheaply constructed, and when it was ""on"", it smelt like burning electronics. I wouldn't trust it as far as I could throw it.Go with another manufacturer, this company makes garbage."
5,The not so simple Organization,"Morgan decribes common assumptions about organizations - he helps to reveal the hidden assumptions behind the managers perceptions. What do we mean when we say that 'organizations are like animals'? It is pretty easy to start to think from a metaphor, and end up in literal believing in it (e.g. that 'organizations live and die', 'organizations have evolutions'). Such reifications are carefully described by Morgan - several most recurrent metaphors of organizations and popular organization theories basing on them are clearly described, and their pros and cons are pointed out. Having read 'Images of Organizations', it is much more difficult to adopt illusionate metaphors, and to get persuaded by a biased visioner."
2,Too esoteric...hard to follow.,"I am a graduate student in organizational development. Although this book has some good underlying concepts, I found most of the book hard to follow and not very engaging. It was often difficult to see how many of the concepts actually apply to organizations. There may be good ideas, but they often get lost in the rambling chapters."
2,Head in the Clouds,"This is a fantastic book for those people who are slowly losing their grip on reality. While some of the basic underlying concepts are good I don't find myself practically applying the concept of psychic prisons to my organisation, nor do I view my staff as ameobas that make up a large organism. I have to admit though that I know of others who found the paradyme of organisations as instruments of domination highly arousing."
2,Jeffrey - ignorance must be bliss?,"Not funny, though it has moments (about three at my last count). The characters are pitiable in their ignorance; and our ""hero"" doesn't seem to learn a ... thing from his consistently bad decisions. To think, even within the context of the time frame of when the film was made, that an [alternative lifestyle] man was in his mid-twenties living in an urban area was so mis-informed or, sadly, un-informed about AIDS, his desires, and his denial is absolutely ludicrous. It could have been charming. It could have been poignant. It could have been many things, but disappointing, ignorant and pathetic are the only adjectives that come to mind. These aspects, even in context of when the film was made, were irresponsible and a true disservice to the [alternative lifestyle] community as a whole. ..."
2,dont bother,"It is ok if You want to see it, but I wouldnt recomended to buy it, cause I wont see it more then the timne I saw it, I really do not know why people have given so much stars to a very regular movie"
1,Sick Movie!,"If your idea of a good movie is a homophobic film that paints all gay men as either having AIDS or bound to get it anyway, then JEFFREY is right up your alley. For the rest of us it is just a sad joke. The main character is so petrified of catching HIV that he literally comes across as a paranoid schizophrenic! This film is nothing but stereotype after stereotype. Nathan Lane appears as a priest who tries to molest Jeffrey and then lets him in on the secret that ""God is found in a Barbra Steisand album."" Huh?? The only funny parts are teh Sigourney Weaver cameo and the phone call with Mom & Dad. otherwise the writing is just horrid! When confronted by a group of bashers they ask what kind of weapon he has. Jeffrey responds ""irony... adjectives."" Say what? Avoid this at all costs!"
4,DELIGHTFUL,"Featuring a number of surprising and deft, if slightly theatrical performances, JEFFREY is a winning movie that confronts the issue of a gay man who has developed a fear of sex. Frank, sexy and funny, this adaptation of Paul Rudnick's play moves at a brisk pace, and is nicely opened up for the movie screen. Stephen Weber is adorable as Jeffrey, and Patrick Stewart, Christine Baranski and Sigourney Weaver have funny, funny cameos. While the subject matter seems slightly dated today, given the advances in AIDS drug therapy, the soul and heart of Jeffrey's dilemma is as true today as it was back in the distant late-80s/early-90s. By the final moments, you will find the romance at this movie's heart moving and sweetly real."
4,Good Movie (how generic is that?),"To start out - Steven Weber, however likeable he might be, is the only person miscast in this movie. I didn't buy anything he said or did. He just looked uncomfortable the entire way through the movie.That being said - I don't think there is a weak cast member here. There are not a lot of major characters - but lots and lots of great supporting roles. Michael T. Weiss does a great job as Steven.Sigourney Weaver and Nathan Lane both should have been nominated for Best Supporting roles from this movie. Of course, that would never happen because they could never ever ever play the clips at any televised award show. Both scenes are priceless. Kathy Najimy, Patrick Stewart and Bryan Batt all do outstanding jobs....and the scene where Jeffrey talks to his parents on the phone is worth the rental fee alone."
3,Provocative story,"In pre-Bush Jr. New York Jeffrey, a handsome same sex attracted bachelor abstained from sex, struggling with his feelings to HIV-positive Steven.It is not only hard but a simply wrong decision all around convinced him.Well, since that time not much changed dealt with both AIDS effect and a problem screened by a funny way but 80% teen boys (14-19 y.o.)started using condoms as a current N.Y. poll estimated."
3,Jeffrey Seems Dated,"I saw this flick originally when it came out. I watched it again on DVD (rental), and was disappointed. Weber, though appealing, seems awfully whiney. I realize his character's indecision about life is what drives the story- but it also drove this viewer crazy. Writer Paul Rudnick has some great lines and there are some good performances- but this film often feels strained. A somewhat enjoyable film, but it could've been better."
3,Frankly I expected more,"Given such a stellar cast it's amazing there could have been so many boring stretches -- mostly Jeffrey's fantasies, which are so silly as to not seem funny at all. On the other hand, if these are edited out, the remaining story, though shorter, emerges with energy and tension to snare your imagination. Weiss was truly excellent as the hot pursuing lover. Weber was OK but he was overshadowed by Weiss. Patrick Stewart nearly stole the whole show for himself, as his excellence as an actor is far beyond that of his co-stars, who lack his experience and training. Notwithstanding the problems of this movie, it is enjoyable on the whole and more than worth the price."
5,What's up with Mother Teresa?,"Actually it is a very funny movie, despite the social content it is bounded, the movie should be also apreciated by the comedy itself, specially the cameo apearences."
1,One of the Worst Gay Movies Ever Made,"I cannot believe that so many people actually liked this movie. I have seen over 60 gay and lesbian movies and this is by far the worst one that I have ever had the misfortune to watch-with ""Chuck and Buck"" running a close second."
4,Very good movie,"LOVE Patrick Stewart in this movie he was AMAZING in this role. I never thought he could pull of being gay (after watching him for years on TNG) but he did. Michael T. Weiss does a fantastic job in his role very believable. Really good cast great plot, I would definitely tell anyone to buy this movie."
3,"Love the movie, DVD recording quality is a little light","If I didn't purchase this directly from Amazon I might question if DVD is a possible bootleg recording like you sometimes find at flea markets. Maybe it being an older movie or poor quality of the source used to make the DVD but I experienced a couple spots where the picture coloring got very ""bleeding"" and warped. I played DVD in my blu-ray player and in my laptop and experienced the same problem at same spots in the movie so it wasn't my television. For the price I'm still glad I bought it but be warned you may experience my same issue."
5,A Rare Treat,"Only two movies that I have watched on the subject of homosexuality have stirred my heartstrings. The first was ""The Boys in the Band"" (if you haven't seen it I would recommend that you do) and the second is ""Jeffrey"". There is the usual camp and one-liners but what brings the movie its class is the chemistry between the two male leads. Both Mr. Weber and Mr. Weiss make their characters believable showing that in all life styles we all want the same thing. We are all scared, searching and hoping we meet that soul mate that will bring life and laughter to our lives. Kudos to these two fine actors whose talents are definitely not utilized enough."
3,"In Spanish, but still good.","This one is a classic. Bugs Bunny finds the easter bunny crying about his sore feet in the woods. He ( being the nice rabbit that he is ) offers to take over. This movie features Elmer Fudd, and a littled red-headed kid that screams ""I wanna easter egg!"". This is definantly a great Bugs cartoon."
2,A Obvious Decline....,"I love keith Richards but it's clear he ran out of new and/or clever, innovative ideas quite some time ago. Mick, too. This album has little edge, skill, or ambition to it. Even Mick's lyrics are lacking. It may have been great to have Mick Taylor come back and try to re-ignite the old, old flame of decades ago. I was afraid this was going to happen with this album...and it did. Another album similar to ""Stripped"" might be good (w/ classic non-Stones cover tunes). Sorry."
4,Back to form,"""A Bigger Bang"" is the Stones album I've been hoping for since 1983's ""Undercover."" This album contains only the core band with a minimal amount of outside musicians, unlike the extravaganzas on prior ones. It's great to hear the four Stones, plus a bassist and maybe a piano player, cranking out rock-n-roll just like the old days. This basic rawness is sadly missing on every album since ""Undercover"".""Bang"" shows that the Stones still have it, and that they can give any modern act a run for their money. I hope the Stones know what works and make their future albums along this vein."
1,It Bloody Wasn't,"Go buy "" Bridges "", "" Steel Wheels "" and avoid the God Awful "" Voodoo Lounge "" and don't waste your time with this rehash of "" Bridges "" "" Steel Wheels "" and the God Awful "" Voodoo Lounge """
1,EVEN A NIRVANA CD IS A BILLION TIMES BETTER.,"GOD DAMN, THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM EVER CREATED EVER!!! EVERY SONG ON THIS IS A BIG TURD. THE STONES WERE AMONGST THE WORST BANDS IN HISTORY ALONG WITH LYNYRD SKYNYRD. NIRVANA NEVERMIND IS A BILLION TIMES BETTER. GO GET THAT INSTED."
1,"0 stars, so horrible","Wow my friends, you can't believe how horrible the Rolling Stones have to be. They are so horrible and overrated, I can't stand them. Their newest album is the lamest, stupidest, and lousiest album I have ever heard. I just saw the LP the other day and thought, NO NO NO because it has 16 of the worst songs ever recorded by the worst band in history. They are just asbad as U2, and ACDC. This has to be worth 0 stars because it isso horrible. JUST FOR KIDS WHO ARE A JOKE. Get any album fromDire Straits or Foreigner insted as they are LEGENDS.Four Fourteen."
1,Not good at all,"The Rolling Stones' new album is the most horrible CD I have ever heard, plus they never made anything good in their whole career. They suck so hard. Why do people like this band so much?This is noise. Get any album from Green Day, Dire Straits, or Guns N' Roses insted."
3,Who cares anymore?,"Every Stones album released since their ""reunion"" back in 1989 has been predictable. I love the band, but I think there needs to come a point where you say, ""enough is enough.""The ballads are enjoyable and the rockers are fun, but I feel sad when I listen to a new Stones album. I guess the way I would feel sad if Baryshnikov attempted a new dance routine. You admire the determination, but you question the necessity.I also dislike the length of the CDs the Stones keep releasing every five to ten years. ""A Bigger Bang"" is longer than most of their truly great albums from the '60's and '70's.I underestand Keith wanted to keep the old warhouse plugging away, the way Muddy and John Lee Hooker kept plugging away when they were in their 70's and beyond. But I do think there is glory in knowing when to throw in the towel. Of all the rock bands in history, I think The Beatles had the best idea... quit while you're at the top of your game. Too bad most rock bands don't understand this."
3,What- a -ya want????,"What do we listen for in a new Rolling Stones album these days? Something new????? Nah,we just want to check the pulse and see how much life is left. Don Was does a good job of making them sound almost like they care, but has mixed the vocals too up front. Charlie still has his killer wack,Kieth gets off one or two zingers every two or three songs,Ronnie is stuck in his Rolling Stone's play-by-the numbers song book, and Mick tries WAY too hard. I admire these guy's dedication to the music,and only they can sound like the Rolling Stones. For me,that's plenty fun enough."
2,a walking Formula,"when I think of the Rolling Stones all I think is a walking Billboard of Logo much else.same Riffs that have been going on for almost 30 years.so-so Lyrics&the vocals have continued to go down hill.The Rolling stones have been so Robitic over the years it ain';t even funny. they Basically found a formula&stuck to it. these days as has been the case for a good 20 plus years they do better concerts than they make decent Albums,even if alot of there Tours are pretty much a set format as well."
5,The Stones Keep Rolling,"Great new tunes for anytime! If you are under the age of 80 youwill love the same spirited classic style of the Stones, with newrhythms and lyrics."
5,"A big bang, indeed!","I took the wait and listen stance, and now I can't stop listening! Another great release from the Stones, that does pack a Bigger Bang!"
3,Bigger Bang...all chops...no hooks,"For a huge Stones fan I was wishing for that mythological ""best Stones album since Exile"" and certainly no new Stones album is worth passing on...but ""Bigger Bang"" is not going to be the album to live up to that description. First a note regarding the production...too compressed and loud...but I have that complaint about 90% of the music that comes out. There is a good reason why ""Rough Justice"" is the lead track...it's the only song with a modicum of a hook. The rest of the disc has great playing, but almost no hooks are to be found. Even the one track that they probably most intentionally try to make a hit ballad ""Steets of Love"" is just plain sleepy.The best Stones CD to come out in the new millennium was indeed their best since Exile...unfortunately it was the remaster of ""Exile on Main Street"" and not ""A Bigger Bang"""
4,OK album...not one of their best,"This album is average. I'm not saying it's bad. Afterall, this is the Rolling Stones. Nothing can go wrong. They're in their 60s and still kick major a**. Rough Justice and Streets of Love are my fav. tracks. Mick is one of the greatest frontman. Hands down. He's great and so is Keith. Get other albums like Sticky Fingers, Beggers Banquet, and Let It Bleed and you'll see why they are one of the greatest band to grace earth. Oh and avoid Green Day and Nirvana. Their only decent album was In Utero. Anything else....forget it. Listen to Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin as well. It's way better than what's on MTV."
1,Great chops + no songs = one hell of a mess,"I wanted to like this so badly, but what a flop. The band SOUNDS great, I don't have any problem with the MUSIC here, BUT the songs almost to a one suffer from an acute case of Jaggeritis, an affliction dating back to Dirty Work where the Mick opts to go on for paragraphs when a few well-chosen words would do the trick. Dangerous Beauty isn't bad, great playing, but who is going to remember any of this in a few months? When even the Keith songs don't cut it, what hope is there left? This feels like a half-finished album, a great band playing hot but with too many wordy whiny Mick solo-album reject lyrics to make it worthwhile. This isn't the comeback album or tour of the year. That honor goes to Garbage, playing their hearts out live and with a solid album to boot. What a depressing disc this is."
5,"SUPERB,SUPERB,SUPERB,SUPERB","TO THE REVIEWER KNOWN AS GOD THAT FAILED A.K.A WHIRLIGIG/FOUR FOURTEEN/LET IT BE/ROCK AND ROLL WILL NEVER DIE/GIRL ON THE MOON/SWEET FALLON/EXPRESSO LOVE/ENTER SANDMAN/KID FROM NAPA/THE BEATLES SUCK/NAPA Vs SAN DIEGO CA/HEAVY FUEL/WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU/DUST'N'BONES/G'N'R ARE GOD/SO FAR AWAY/TELEGRAPH ROAD/MACY ROCKAWAY.YOUR OPINION ON GREAT BANDS LIKE PINK FLOYD,LED ZEPPELIN,THE WHO AND THE ROLLING STONES IS NOT REQUIREDI LOVE THE STONES WHO ARE AMONGST THE GREATEST ROCK BANDS EVER.THEY HAVE MADE COUNTLESS NUMBER OF GREAT ALBUMS INCLUDING THIS ONE.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.ALL THEIR ALBUMS ARE FANTASTIC.BUY THEMTHE STONES ARE GREAT,THE STONES ARE GREAT,THE STONES ARE GREAT,THE STONES ARE GREAT,THE STONES ARE GREAT,THE STONES ARE GREAT,THE STONES ARE GREAT,THE STONES ARE GREAT,THE STONES ARE GREAT.IGNORE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER AND AVOID LAME,LOUSY,OVERRATED AND STUPID BANDS LIKE FOREIGNER.BUY THIS WITH THE WALL,ABBEY ROAD AND BACK IN BLACK WHICH ARE ALL GREAT ALBUMS.THANKS."
4,"Hey, it's the Rolling Stones...","The Rolling Stones are great. This CD is by the Rolling Stones, thus great also. One thing pissed me off though. I hate it when bands I love get political, especially in this way. That song should not have made the cut, it's ridiculous and not even that good.However, the rest of the album is great Stones music. Get it if you're a Stone's fan.That's it!"
2,Nothing stands out...,"Rolling Stones by the numbers. It's ok and it does rock for a bunch of guys now in their 60's. However, nothing stands out. Where is the ""Start Me Up"", ""Brown Sugar""?I listened to it over and over and it sounds as if they decided it's time to tour, we had better put out a CD. That said, why bother? We will all show up at the concert anyway. I just hope they don't play too many songs from this CD.They can and have done much better in the past. Go to the concerts and avoid this CD."
4,"Raw and ragged, just like Keith's liver","These old guys still have it. From the ridiculous over the top innuendo of ""Rough Justice"" to the last track, this is a sweet Stones album, and much better than anything they've put out in the last two decades. If the word on the street is right, and this is their last studio album, they've definitely gone out in style."
4,Biggest Bang Since Some Girls,"A Bigger Bang is a great comeback by the Stones. Ron Woods slide on Rough Justice gets it off to arolicking start. It wont take long has good guitar.Rain Kept Falling has a Miss you vibe. Streets of Love is great. Back of my Hand continues the Stones great blues legacy. Laugh i Nearly Died is good blues too. The rock songs Oh No not you Again, Dangerous Beauty and Look At What The Cat Dragged In, make A Bigger Bang the best Stones cd since Some Girls."
5,A Good Stones Album For ANY Decade,"A lot of people have remarked that this album is their best album in 10, 20 or 25 years. I'm going to go one step further and say that this album stands along side their work from any era. I'm not saying that it is their absolute best album of all time but it is in the same league as the great albums from the Mick Taylor era.I have seen them live on this tour twice and I frequently check their set lists on the tour web site. I can't for the life of me undersand why they haven't played ""It Won't Take Long"" yet. To me it is the best song of the Ron Wood era and I think it would work very well live.The other highlights of this album are Sweet Neo-Con and Keith's great take on ""Infamy'. The last 4 or 5 albums have been highlighted by a song with Keith on lead vocals and this one is no exception."
4,Good solid disc from the Stones,The Stones have kept it safe and stuck to their Rock Roots with a few Blues tunes mixed in.As value for money at 1 hour plus this is great stuff.Look forward to the DVD version of the same album.
5,"This is a great album, a thrilling display of funky brilliance and virtuosity.","You should listen to this album many many times, like for a whole evening, sipping Martinis or Margaritas or whatever you like to drink. It's one of their greats, along with ""Some Girls"", ""Exile on Main Street"" and the others. This one is notable for the funky guitars, the jazz influence, and Keith Richards sounding like he's singing in Humphrey Bogart's bar in ""Casablanca"". Most importantly, this album appears to have been very carefully made, with a tremendous shot of inspiration, and it gets better every time you hear it."
1,Dead brain cells.,"Now Mick Jagger takes a swipe at the Presedent and conservatives in general with ""Sweet Neo-Con"". If anyone needs proof that drugs kill brain cells, they only need to look at all these Rock stars trying to be political scientists. The Rolling Stones should stick to writing songs about cheap sex, boos and partying. anything deeper than that could risk the loss of thier few remaining brain cells. Of course, the president and the conservatives needent be offended. Criticism from a bunch of old brain dead, stoner geezers should be taken as a compliment.after all, advice about character should come from one who actually has some. Womanizing stoners and boozers don't generally make the best judges on such matters. Advice to Mick: leave the political commentary to the professionals. Stick to the subjects you actually know: Getting laid and getting wasted."
1,THE ROLLING STONES SUCK,"HOW COME PEOPLE LOVE A HORRIBLE BAND THE ROLLING STONES? THEY ARE MEANT FOR BABIES. AND THEIR NEW ALBUM SUCH AS THIS SUCKS SO HARD, I'D AVOID IT. THE LYRICS AREN'T GOOD AS HAS 16 OF THE WORSTSONGS EVER MADE. STAY AWAY FROM ALL THE ALBUMS FROM THIS LOUSY BAND. DIRE STRAITS AND FOREIGNER ARE MUCH BETTER."
1,Don't Read THE BEATLES ROCK's Review...This is Pure Garbage!!,"Well, i'm gonna say my prayers to THE BEATLES ROCK. What is your problem? The bands you hate are legends, and the bands you like are really really awful and joke. If you can't talent my legends, then what the hell are you doing on the internet???Huh why?Anyway, The Rolling Stones are stupid! They only made 2 decent songs in Start Me Up, and Shattered. Rest of their albums and songsjust stink, including their newest one. Avoid this and get a Foreigner or Metallica CD insted.PS.Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and The Beatles are garbage so avoid allalbums from those bands."
1,Here they go again .,"If you have heard any Rolling Stones album that hey have put out in the past 30 years,you have heard this.When oh when are they going to give up the ghost? If you have to buy a Stones album,go with something pre 1973."
2,Not up to Standard,"I found myself to very disappointed with this CD as it was just not up to the usual standards of this band. I found all the cuts to sound similiar and I missed the ""bluesy-ness"" we have come to expect from this once great band."
3,"Listenable, but forgettable","I laugh at the reviews of folk (some of whom I suspect are record company people) who claim this hearkins back to the ""day."" It does not. Any and all songs from this cd could be interchanged with those from Steel Wheels, Voodoo Lounge, or Bridges to Babylon - and no one would be any the wiser. Like those previous albums, this cd is listenable for now, but in a year's time, we will not be able to recall one tune from the bunch (in my humble opinion).The Stones ARE great..I pray they tour for a long time more and entertain us with new songs...but to say this is better than anything since Steel Wheels (their best ""recent"" cd) is a joke."
1,OH NO NOT THEM AGAIN,I THINK I JUST MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE BY BUYING THIS BAD BAD ALBUM. ROUGH JUSTICE...THATS WHEN YOU THROW YOUR MONEY DOWN THE TOILET ON REMAKES OF SONGS THAT ARE 30 YEARS OLD. YOU WANNA HEAR THE STONES THEN GET FORTY LICKS. AVOID!
5,No more dandruff,"...because I always scratched my head wondering why artists when they are young write such great songs, but when they get older, they suck. For example, see U2. And what's up with Dep Leppard morphing into the Backstreet Boys? But not the Stones. It's like we're in a time warp, and it's still 1980! And if you disagree with my opinion, you can suck on big moosey juicy one. Word. Sentence. Paragraph."
1,The Stones Can Do Better,"This album is full of the type of crap we have come to expect from Richards, but even Jagger could not pull it out of the doldrums."
1,Not very good...,"I consider myself a pretty big Stones fan. They've always been in my life, and I own each record, and can appreciate them all. I actually think Bridges to Babylon is one of their finest record (I don't dislike a single song on it) but A Bigger Bang is just not very good. Stuff like ""Streets of Love"" is just awful easy listening, and ""Sweet Neocon"" is just the Stones trying too hard to create controversy during the Bush Years. I did like ""Rough Justice"" for about ten seconds then realized, again, they were trying way too hard to ""rock"".I think the Stones will eventually admit that this record stinks.Thank God for the second side of the Exile on Main St. reissue. It more than makes up for A Bigger Bang being the Stones final studio output."
3,"Nothing Special Here, But OK","Let's face it, this 'aint ""Some Girls,"" and it isn't even as good as ""Undercover,"" but whatever--it is a new album from the Stones and that is good news. There are some dogs on this one, like ""Streets of Love,"" which sounds like an outtake from Mick's ""Goddess in the Doorway"" solo effort or even worse, the ""Alfie"" soundtrack. But, I guess this is the best they have to offer at this point in their career.It is amazing that this band, who, with ""Beggar's Banquet,"" ""Let It Bleed,"" ""Sticky Fingers"" and ""Exile on Main Street,"" created 4 of the best albums of all time, now puts out such middling stuff. I guess the songwriting gift dries up at some point. Just don't tell that to Bob Dylan or Tom Waits..."
1,should be called a bigger blow,"Let's face it--the stones are a concert band PERIOD.This cd is pure drivel--sweet neo con is the dumbest song I ever heard with the dumbest lyrics i ever heard.When Mick swears in concert we shake our heads and go that was cool,when he swears on this album i think he did it just to hear the words.They mean nothing.Being an optimist that I am the 2 richards songs with him singing are pretty good--other than that this album is a major disapointment."
1,the same thing.....,"The rolling stones are making the same music from 20 ago....and now..as multi-millionaries, they are playing to rebels..writting songs about bush etc...Ths is the only way to call the media attention?"
4,Big Bang for you Buck,"Bigger Bang may not be the best Rolling Stones album of all time, but it's far from being the worst too. The first time I put this album in and started playing it, I felt time warped back to another time. A time when bell bottoms were coming into fashion and music had a real feel to it. This is the Rolling Stones of old in a way, but with a touch of newness to their music. Songs like ""Rough Justice"" and ""Biggest Mistake"" could be right from albums of that time period. Which to me is a much needed thing now adays. The Rolling Stones have brought music back to music with this album. If you like Classic Rock or are just a Stones fan make sure to pick this one up as soon as you can. Actual rating: 4.5 stars"
5,DEFINITELY worth the wait,"Who knew they still had it in them? Mick and Keith can still crank out a fine set of tunes, and there's a great set of them here. To be honest, I can't think of one song that I would skip on this disc. Even the ""Angie""sequel ""Streets Of Love"" has grown on me, and is actually pretty good. Of course, ""Rough Justice"" ""Back of My Hand"" ""Look What the Cat Dragged In"" ""Dangerous Beauty"" and all vintage Stones tunes, and stand out to me more than anything of Bridges to Babylon. The real stunners for me are actually ""She Saw Me Coming"", which some knock as repetitive but I was bowled over by it upon first listening, and Keith's closer ""Infamy"", which has yet to stop playing through my head. All Stones fans should own this, no doubt. Its just a matter of time until this one gets thrown in there next to ""Some Girls"" ""Tattoo You"" and ""Aftermath"". Probably not the big four though, as no one will ever top that batch."
5,It makes me cry because is too good to be truth,"This album is amazing, it could be better but even the Universe has it's flaws...even the Bigger Bang.The fact is that this is a bunch of 60 years olders and THEY CAN ROCK!! better than all the overly-image-created teens that rule the charts this days.This is how music is done kids...and by the way I'm only 28 years old so don't think is your grandpa talking. So make yourself a favor and buy this pice of history...it is really good, very, very good and will bring happy tears in the eyes of those who still have ears."
3,a helpful review,"to be honest, this album is better than average. there are some good songs like ""rain fall down"" and ""back of my hand"" however there are some bad ones like ""biggest mistake"". the stones are my favorite band and they have been producing great songs over the years. all in all, the goods songs on this album out weigh the bad ones so this album is a must have for any stones fan. ignore the reveiws that say this album is terrible because its no but at the same time, i dont think this is a 5-star album like let it bleed or beggers banquet."
2,Corporate Rock,For about the last 20 years or so it always the same thing when the Stones release a studio album - this time they're serious. Sure.
1,What's next?,"So, I wonder what's next for these guys? Gee...hmmm...can you guess?A LIVE ALBUM!Yep, these so-called bad boys of rock are the most predictable act going. A studio album followed by a tour, then a live album. Heck, last time around they didn't even have a new studio album, just a massive greatest hits collection followed by a tour and then...A LIVE ALBUM. What bores they are. ""A Bigger Bang""? A BIGGER BORE."
2,Sterile production,"Stones albums of late have suffered from sounding too clean, too precise. When I look at the credits - well, what do you know (and big surprise): produced by Don Was. They need to get the hell away from these old, outdated GOATS and get with some new blood, bring in some people who will bring out some much needed organic grit and warmth. Even though the band is OLD I can tell they have ""it"" still in them. Dump Was (Not Was) and hire some REAL talent."
3,Are albums getting to long?,"This release is pretty much standard Rolling Stone post Tatto You fair. Neither bad nor good. As always there is some great rythms and nice crunchy guitars mixed with mediocre song writing. Fun to listen to for a while then you put it on your shelf and forget all about it. It would probably be a lot more fun if it were half as long as about 3/4 of the tracks I just skip over. Which seems to be kind of standard now. When albums were good for about 40 minutes tops it seems albums were a lot tighter, but with 80 minutes of potential time I get the feeling artist tend to try to fill them up with tracks that were best left in the studio. Something for those Bside and rarity releases that they so love to pawn off on us."
4,Hard to pin down,"The first time I listened to A Bigger Bang, I was unimpressed. The songs all seemed lackluster, and either too trite or too contrived. But after a few more listens, I have started to warm up to it. While it might not be a GREAT album, it is a good one.What I find interesting about many reviews of A Bigger Bang (not just those on Amazon, but those from many professional reviewers), is that everyone seems to agree that the album is too long. They all say it would have benefited by omitting a handful of tunes, but then they vary about which tunes are the keepers and which are the losers.Here's my list of the expendible tunes:- Rain Fall Down- Back Of My Hand- Oh No, Not You Again- Dangerous Beauty- Driving Too FastI fully expect that other reviewers will disagree with my selections and prefer to punt a few different tunes. But that's the whole point of my review: it's hard to pin down what's good or bad on this album."
4,Veterans Victory,"The Rolling Stones have suceeded in my opinon with this new record in outdoing present day rock-posers. It is unfair to compare it to any earlier effort, becase they speak here of contemporary times. Now is where it's at; Not 1981 or 1972 or 1968, but 2005.Funny we don't allow rockers the same grace we give jazzmen or blues singers/artists. An aged jazz player is given points for substance and soul rather than looks. But not so with rock and roll.But if posers are what you want, psuedo-angry music industry sellouts, then stay away from this record. Hey maybe you can invent somthing of your own rather than copying from the 1960's.It's only rock and roll...still"
4,Best album from someone older then my grandpa ever!!,"This is one of the best Stones albums in a while, The last couple albums havent been the greatest but this is a comeback,I'm not going to go into detail but if you like Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, The Experience, or any of the other great bands from the 60's and 70's this is for you.EVERY SINGLE BAD REVIEW IS FROM THE SAME GUY UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME... read them you'll see what I mean."
5,A bigger surprise,"I'll be 46 in January 2006, and have been a Stones fan since I first heard Get Yer Ya Ya's Out when I was about 10 in 1970. I remember eagerly awaiting the release of albums such as Sticky Fingers, Exiles, IORR and so on. I lost interest after Tattoo You, but still kept in touch with what the Stones were up to, whilst my musical tastes broadened.To cut a long srory short, I sit here typing this review listening to A Bigger Bang for the 10th time through a pair of Ultimate Ears UE10 Pro Earphones (the very ones Mick uses on stage). Suddenly I get it, this album absolutely rocks with power and emotion. If I could create music of this energy and turn on huge crowds like these old boys can still do, I'd never give it up.Onya boys, keep going......lets see how far this thing can go."
1,Rubbish,"As a lifelong Stones fanatic, I'm sorry to say Bigger Bang is rubbish. It joins their other 2 rubbish efforts, Undercover and Emotional Rescue. I love the Stones, I absolutely adore the Stones, they are my life and over close to 50 years at the very top you are entitled to 3 bad albums. Sadly, this is one of them. Not one single memorable song. One star because you cant give zero stars."
1,waste of time,an insult to the buying public. no wonder few people under 35 know how they used to play.i'm surprised that their musical integrity would let this one out.
4,Outstanding,"Play it loud and play it often. Like previous Stones albums, the songs really do sound better the more you hear them. Some folks are saying this is the best Stones material since Exile on Main St. The problem with Exile was that maybe 5 out of 18 songs were worth listening to, the rest was weird filler stuff. On Bigger Bang, all the songs are sing along worthy, plus the band is really in the groove instrumentation wise. I would say this is the best stuff since Beggars Banquet and Let It Bleed, the two great Stones albums that albeit very short, every song was great, with no filler crap. You will enjoy Bigger Bang."
2,"Oh, Pleeeze","The lyrics on Biggerbang are so bad! If you have a brain, you will cringe. ""...i'm just one of your cocks"": How old are you guys!? Musically it's pretty rockin and tight. I wish you could turn down Jagger, not because of his singing which is really good but because the lyrics seem like they were written by a fourteen year old with a big ego."
2,OK,"I was required to buy this for a terrible class I took in law school. It is a left wing propaganda book. If you voted for Ralph Nader and think that Howard Zinn is a proper historian, you will love this book. If you have any sort of desire for balance or fairness in the presentation of history look elsewhere."
2,Regurtitating her visit to our company,"I worked for one of the companies analyzed (and praised) in her book. She spent a few days with us, and we presented our Web strategies, which were not very strong at the time. She presented material from her Customers.com book (which I enjoyed more than this book). And then she pointed out many problems with our Web strategies (many of which we knew...but being a large company, we were having difficulty changing). Imagine my surprise when I listened to this book and heard her praise our company. She should be in PR...she made us sound a lot better than we were!"
1,Martin Reviewer Accurate,"Martin review about the book is accurate...it is a rehash of primitive Marketing 0001 concepts and offers nothing but repackaged and ancient maxims in the new IT speak...I mean if you read the review by Mitchell a ""Top 10 Reviewer"" (what ever that is) you will see Marketing 0001 drivel littered in litany...unless you are thick or truly a dim bulb about sales and marketing, these ""revelations"" are straight from an introductory sales and marketing book...save yourself the money and buy Kalkota..."
1,Don't waste your money ...,"I agree that if you read the reviews on the back of the back you could understand the whole book without even reading a page.If you read this book and feel you need to break down your customers to the agonizing details that she has developed, I feel sorry for your investors. There is no way for a company that follows her advice to become or remain profitable. The only conclusion would be that you need her consulting services because there's no way you could do it yourself.Don't waste your time and money reading this book."
3,Great title,"I found The Customer Revolution above all a very good title, like it was Seybold's previous published title Customers.com.I love the subject and agree that putting customers at the core of organizations will improve business, but if it is answers/solutions that you are looking for, I recommend you to give a look at Max Mckeow's books E-customer and soon to be published Why They Don't Buy."
4,This is a Level 5 book,"This book is a level/grade 5 edition. This is not stated anywhere in the title or description. The main focus of the book is cursive handwriting and in no way is a beginner book. I gave the book 4 stars because it appears to be a good book for that level, but I wanted a preschool level introduction to handwriting, so it's going back."
3,Entertaining But Confusing,"On the one hand, I like the book. On the other hand, I find this to be completely confusing.The book is well written, and is a great book to read. However, for one like me, who had no idea about German history, there was no anchor. I have studied history in school the more traditional way; with dates, places, maps etc. This was lacking in this book. The inter-connectedness of the nations and the huge influence of the papacy came as a surprise to me. There was a lot of space given to Martin Luther, but I completely missed the link between this, the kings / rulers, and how the boundaries of the various kingdoms changed over the centuries.When did Germany really become a nation? This is something that is still a mystery to me at the end of the book"
3,This was when CPD tried to abandon their roots,"This release was the last full length record before ZSR. It's a good disc, but not what you'd expect after hearing ZSR or Ferociously stoned, the horns are buried and it's very guitar driven. It was, in my estimation, a shot at trying to change the sound to get some airplay -- thankfully if faield"
4,"So, what is Kinsey studying, exactly?","I kid, really. This is a brilliantly thought-provoking film about the life of a man we all equate with, of course, sex. And the film does not shy away from any of the aspects of his methods, which is good for those of us who Kinsey would want to reach the most - those too sexually repressed to do so much as kiss before marriage. And those of us who simply do not understand.And I did love this movie, but I have a complicated qualm. By the end, I was so very sick and tired of hearing about studies of sex and how far Kinsey was going, I nearly went cross-eyed. But that's hardly the movie's fault because they are dealing with a man who was obsessed! That was my personal reaction, however, and the only reason I couldn't give it four stars. But the performances were brilliant, the script was complete, and this is a great film."
3,about the movie Kinsey....,This film is providing a more comedic method of bringing up the topic on sex. It sometimes or what I can say is once in a while talking about dark jokes about sex which give the story a more lively and interesting approach. Visit your nearest theatre now for those whom are interested in this film.
2,"I ""Kinsey"" I made a mistake","Some good performances, especially by Linney & Lithgow, but a rather tedious Hollywood movie. Even so, it is worth slogging your way through to the end for the piece de resistance: a brilliantly performed monologue by Lynn Redgrave."
3,No Kink Kinsey,"This well-meaning portrait of pioneering sex researcher, Kinsey, moves at glacial pace. I could see it being a PBS production or something done on cable but this flick doesn't cause any sparks--even though the whole theme is S-E-X! There's one fairly juicy moment when Kinsey kisses his male assistant hungrily on the mouth but then the scene abruptly ends. You don't know if the two men actually made whoppee or stopped at kissing. The cast is good, the production is handsome but for this viewer, I wanted something more racy and vibrant than this solemn portrait of a man who changed America's views on sex."
3,Life and limbido without checks and balances,"I have a problem with the fundamental theme of this movie (and the original KINSEY report on sexual behaviour upon which it is based). The presupposition that sexual drives are what motivates all human behavior is simplistic, naive' and wrong. If this were true, wars could be stopped by the diplomatic intervention of Pamela Sue Anderson, and every television commercial would feature the ""Solid Gold"" or ""Chippendale"" dancers. Perhaps sexual orientation and motivation are a subtext in many (if not most) lives. But if our society is as vapid and horny as ""Kinsey"" would believe, God save us all from an anarchy of orgy."
3,Interesting and informative,"Watching this film, I couldn't help but wonder if people really were that ignorant so not very long ago. It just seems so odd and unbelievable. But maybe because I didn't grow up that way, in that prudish time. It also seems to me, that if it were not for this man Kinsey, then alot of people would have remained igonrant for quite a while. Liam Neeson is unabashed and perfect for this role. He loses himself in it and its quite believable. Laura Linney is also quite good as his faithful and understanding wife. They really make it work onscreen. Because of them, it makes the film watchable because, though the topic is somewhat riské, the movie is a bit dull at times. But those actors really shine and because of that, I was still able to enjoy the film and get a good sense of who Kinsey was and what it was like during that era."
3,The Gospel According to Saint Alfred,"Kinsey may talk frankly about sex, but while it's entertaining enough there's not much there. Bill Condon is too in awe of his subject to seek out the drama in his story: indeed, its surprising just how easy the film makes Kinsey's sex studies seem. With no trouble getting a grant and only Tim Curry's shallow stereotype offering any campus opposition, there's not much in the way of threat or challenge, and the film seems afraid to go to the really dark places aside from one brief scene with William Sadler's proud paedophile. Throughout, Kinsey is presented like Abraham Lincoln freeing the slaves and the promise of the early scenes gives way to an old-fashioned biopic that feels so surprisingly like a 50s Scope movie with rude words that I expected a young Gregory Peck to turn up in a grey flannel suit at any moment. Odd, too, to note that Neeson seems to have based his American accent not on Americans but on Anthony Hopkins standard-issue American accent."
3,"Kinsey - the movie, not the man","I'm not insensed by Kinsey the man (unlike some other reviewers) - nor am I by the movie.I have no idea how factual the movie itself is. I do know the movie was only mildly entertaining. The performances were strong (at least Neeson, Linney and Lithgow). Oliver Platt and Veronica Cartwright were ok - the former too understanding as an administrator, the latter used too little. Timothy Hutton and Chris O'Donnell were just as bland as they are in most everything and Peter Sarsgaard just plain out gives me the creeps no matter what role he plays.Maybe you're not supposed to - but I never found myself caring about any of the characters, save one: Lynn Redgrave. Her 4 minutes on screen conveyed only one sense of good that came out of Kinsey's work. I'm sure there were others - socially or scientifically - but the the movie didn't portray these.'Kinsey' is probably an ok rental - but not worthy a purchase."
3,Let's talk about sex...,"This film is the biographical tale of American sex researcher Dr. Kinsey who defied the conventions of the time to learn more about human sexuality and dispel some of the myths about sex. He conducted interviews with subjects with the help of his team of doctors. As the study continued, relationships in his research team changed as different members, Dr. Kinsey, and his wife discovered other sexual partners. He came to believe that his work wasn't doing any good until he learns that it gave people the courage to act on their true sexual identities.I liked this movie, even though it was a little bit long. It was intelligent despite its sexual theme and handled the subject in an interesting an innovative manner. The acting was superb, especially Liam Neeson as Dr. Kinsey. I don't know if it would handle repeat viewings very well, but everyone should she this movie at least once."
2,Boring!!,"This movie is an utterly tedious treatment of a very interesting topic. Everything in it is stale and trite, and it plods along from incident to incident, without any drama at all. It's a rare movie with good production values and fine actors that I cannot sit through, but I pushed the OFF button on this one after an hour or so."
1,kinsey: a rapist by proxy,"a movie about a disgusting man that exploited the innocence of CHILDREN to further his research. a disgrace to humanity, and a disgrace to the political left."
4,ABOUT TIME,"""Let's talk about Sex,"" which was not done often enough in the past generations - thus, a lot of ridiulous ideas and beliefs were floating around what happens in the bedroom, or for that matter, in parked cars and behind barns. Kinsey shone a light on the so-called forbidden topic and made everyone realize that we're not all the same, and there are great variables in human sexuality. Wife Clara should also get a lot recognition for her total support, and for caring and watching over their family and his projects. Laura Linney was outstanding in this role, as was Liam Neeson playing Kinsey, a superb actor. Much of the research led us into the '60's and '70's, and this new open approach to one of our natural impulses. Good movie."
4,ggreat,Interesting look at how far our sexuality research has come due to work of kinsey . some parts may make people uncomfortable. we need shaking up every now and then .
2,Pretentious Attempt,"In retrospection, Kinsey is over-rated. It rides on the 21st century's fetish of sexuality and pretends to be another ""Beautiful Mind"" but fails and flops. It is one of those pretentious artistic attempt."
1,From a Movie Critic,"I chose not to see this movie because of an enlightening review by Michael Medved, who has a pretty solid system for rating movies. Here's the link: http://www.eyeonentertainment.net/id2.html"
2,it wasn't really about Kinsey,"I went to see the film on a sunday and expected it to be unbelievable. It got excellent reviews, and I know people who said it was excellent. The baggining of the movie was very catchy and entertaining. It was more about his life. But then he started doing the interviews. Then that's what the whole movie was about. It was about his studies not him. I found it a bit of a bore. The ending was good though. When the woman told him he was a hero. If you are looking for a movie about Alfred Kinsey. Its not. Its just about his studies."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though it deserves praise for tackling such a risque subject, Kinsey ultimately fails as a movie (despite several sterling performances) due to its utter reluctance to rise above a completely formulaic, Biopic 101, narrative thrust."
3,I learned a lot,"An interesting movie. I learned a lot about Dr. Kinsey, though the movie sways off at the end and I was wanting to know more at the end."
5,"Powerful, imaginative treatment of a controversial life","Bill Condon provides us with a real gift -- an unflinching look at the life and work of Alfred ""PROK"" Kinsey. The sex is as pervasive as the humor in this brilliant biopic.The strength of the performances moves this film along despite the uneasiness engendered by a look at this very repressed era. Neeson, Linney and Saarsgard are especially memorable, but the other supporting cast, full of notables, is quite good.There are a few missteps, with a few uneven performances and occasional shallow spots. I wish Condon and the writers would have gone deeper in spots (NPI) and lingered a bit during certain scenes, but overall this is a remarkable piece.****1/2"
3,"Week Plot, Good Acting","While both Liam Neeson and Laura Linney give good performances in Kinsey, I just thought the plot was really weak.Maybe the whole point is to show Kinsey as a ""scientist"". But I just felt none of the characters had alot of personality. Everything was portrayed as very cold - especially the sex. It was clinical with no romance or morals. Maybe the point was to show that Kinsey and his fellow scientists were emotionally cold people. I just didn't feel any emotion for the characters the way the screenplay portrayed them."
4,Kinsey,"Ok, so I bought this movie because I saw an HBO special on the making of Kinsey. When I actually got to see the movie I was hideously surprised. I saw this with a group of my college friends. Oh man. This movie is definitely not for the family. Extremely graphic. EXTREMELY GRAPHIC. Rating for this movie should be NC-17, not R. That's how graphic. There are certain scenes that are controversial, if you've seen this movie I'm sure you know what scenes. Watch this movie away from children. Good for adult viewing. Overall movie was funny and interesting. Not For Children."
3,a Movie that went into many directions,watching this Movie one might be thinking of a Jerry Springer episode gone twistedl nothing was off limits in Kinsey's world. so many things in what he would become.some things make sense&some just make you go HMMMMMM???? Liaam Neeson does a god job in his portrayal.
2,"For a movie about sex, it sure is boring.","This movie was long, drawn out and slow. If you want to know about the personal life of Alfred Kinsey, just read an article about him on an online encyclopedia.The worst part of the movie was the horrible makeup job done to make Liam Neeson look like he was in his 20's. In fact, it was pretty disturbing."
5,kinsey,came on time and in excellent condition. great story about a great man who changed the way we view sex in the world
2,David Caruso films,I am a huge fan of David Caruso and looked forward to seeing this film - it seemed to offer something different and enjoyable - What a disappointment!Almost 90% of the film seems to have been shot in the dark or half light making it very difficult to really see what is happening - I suppose it would be alright for a young person with 20/20 vision but it didn't suit me. I have put it in my pile of DVD's to go to the charity shop!
1,The 'Best' more like the worst compilation!,"Yes, an overview of latin rhythms but that is my only favorable comment. This is truly a hodge-podge of recorded material and no musical credits are given, as to 'who is playing' or 'when any particular track was recorded'. This disc's 1st track is a piano solo but don't be fooled into thinking that would occur again - oh no - that would be too logical - and logic plays no role here!"
2,ho-hum,"i particularly liked Funeral Music and hurridly ordered this book assuming it would be equally good. i was disappointed and skimmed much of it. the story meanders too much, the characters think and talk too much and there is not a coherent and direct story line. i'm hoping the next book in the series moves more quickly. i have started Half Broken Things by Joss and have higher hopes for it."
3,Good book if you have a teacher,"I was hoping to learn about North Indian vocal music. This would make a wonderful classroom textbook at a college, but only if you have an experienced teacher. It's not self-help at all. There is no DVD or CD to hear what the notation indicates.In short, not that it's a bad book, it's actually well-written. I just wish it had either been labeled as a classroom textbook or had come with a DVD or CD examples."
5,The best book on drafting for weaving that I've seen!,Even experienced weavers can use a refresher and this book is it! It covers all aspects of weaving drafts. It is fine for a beginner and everyone else.
4,Creative Weaving,I have taken an intermediate weaving course and the instructor recommended this classic book. It is useful for those weavers who wish to create their own patterns rather than recipee weaving.The author apparently lives in our area and gave an excellent class as well.
3,cheap chain for a cheap wallet,I changed the chain that came with it. It's a good wallet for the price. the zipper tab broke so I put a safety pin in it's place.
3,Interesting book,Took a while to get into the book. In the end a good story with s strong ending. Enjoy the 're
5,Another winner,I highly recommend this book as well as others written by Jance. I've read several now and have enjoyed every one!
1,the plot itself could make a movie on Lifetime or Oxygen,do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book.
1,Zero stars if there was an option!!,"This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative."
3,"Not The Best, Not The Worst","Sheriff Joanna Brady is back, along with her husband Butch, and all her familiar deputies and side characters. The problem with this book is that it leaves way too much up in the air to be answered/solved in the next book. Although the crimes are reprehensible, they are wrapped up rather neatly, with one bad guy getting killed, and another one giving a key confession, with very little work from the sheriff. It was interesting enough to keep me guessing until the end of the book. However, the ending was also wrapped up rather neatly. It's an okay book, but I think I like some of the other mysteries that came out this Summer a lot better."
1,Do yourself a favor and pass on this piece of garbage,"I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller. Goes to show you some people have really bad taste. The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog. It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc. I would NEVER purchase another book by this author. Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can... Charlie"
3,"Couldn't wait to ""exit""","The premise of this book is interesting, but falls flat. The lead character is a female sheriff who is up for re- election. Her character needed to be developed more as did the rest of the characters. The plot was boring at times, predictable and repetitious. The audio CD performance left much to be desired. The narrator's range was limited. Overall, I would not waste your time with this book, especially on CD."
2,Annoying Audio Book Reader,"Exit Wounds, by J.A. Jance, is my second Joanna Brady mystery. This review is based on the audio version. The reader, Debra Monk, was a little annoying. Everything she said was pretty monotone.This story started off really well, and caught my interest immediately. Carol Mossman, a loner, is found shot to death in her mobile home. Carol's seventeen dogs, were trapped inside her mobile home, and all except a puppy are found dead from the Arizona heat.What follows after this was several subplots: Joanna's unexpected pregnancy, every minute detail about her home life and her job, and another subplot about illegal immigrants. None of these subplots were needed, in my opinion, as I felt it just made the plot drag, until we find out what really happened to Carol Mossman.This was my second Joanna Brady, Jance novel in the past month, and at least for now, I plan to pass on this author."
3,"Enticing, yet not exciting","I was able to maintain a high level of interest in this story of a female sheriff investigating the murder of a indigent woman with multiple pets in rural Arizona. While not an ""edge of your seat"" thriller, this book presents what I would compare to a good detective TV series. Joanna Brady is an interesting character who you will like to get to know (or continue to know if you follow the series). In addition to the main plot, you get to follow Joanna's day to day challenges with her family and other police duties. The main plot does keep you wondering as any classic whodunnit would, with some, unfortunately predictable twists. Some may get annoyed with the authors more than subtle message about animal cruelty. The 1 star harsh reviews noted here are not a fair representation of the quality of the book. This was my first Jance book and it prompted me to buy others, including the thriller series."
3,Rhetoric of Agitation,This was an assigned book for grad school and I probably would not have read it otherwise. It has a left wing bent.
3,Tracy's best,"This is probably Tracy Lawrence's best album. And ""Unforgiven"" is a great, bone-headed song showing that Tracy hasn't learned anything from the bad turns in his personal life if he believes these lyrics. The production is good, the singing his best yet. Too bad most of the lyrics are strictly generic."
2,Good intentioned and well acted but oh so dull,"This movie is fairly typical of the ""romantic/ghost"" genre. A grieving widow sees ""signs"" that her deceased, alcoholic, husband is trying to somehow contact her. In the meantime a romantic love interest moves in next door.The movie is well acted, Andie McDowell is excellent as a confused, grieving widow trying to take care of her kids. Even Margot Kidder (superman) is good as the psychic co-worker.The film ultimately falls flat when the ""signs"" and the message are a disappointment. Granted the movie is more about grief and forgiveness and if that's the case, why do we need a ghost story to do it?Last but not least, shame on whomever decided that Samuel Le Bihan needed to be dubbed.Rent it but don't expect it to be as thrilling as the box cover."
4,Functional,"It's been a long time since I had worn tennis panties and now I remember why I didn't miss them. Isn't there a way to design panties that are functional, modest, and flattering?These knickers indeed hold balls. The pockets are very accessible and the fabric seems like something that will endure many sets and subsequent washings. I just wish they didn't look like granny panties."
2,"nice stereo , near ZERO network radio","It's good Stereo. I must be the ONLY person who actually bought one. You can still find a couple of working IM stations, mostly non-USA and mostly pop music.I really wanted to be able to play MP3s from my PC hard drive, but the promised software to let that happen is nowhere to be found. And the maker appears to have abandoned the whole project."
2,"OK, but there's better stuff out there for the money","....I think this thing is sortof nice the way it has an integrated Tape and CD, but generally I think it is really crappy compared to the Turtle Beach Audiotron. Granted that unit is designed to be connected to a real stereo, and not imitate a real stereo like this unit, but the support for formats, and features is 400% better on that unit.The Audiotron is also able to play icecast and shoutcast..."
3,"Good, but a little slow","I enjoyed Jim Brosnan's The Long Season. I didn't think that the book was quite as good as its reputation, however.It is easy to see why The Long Season made such a strong impression when it was published in 1960. Brosnan's account of the 1959 baseball season was one of the first books that didn't ""sugarcoat"" the professional athlete's life. Brosnan is very opinionated about baseball and the characters in the baseball world.I don't think that the book has aged that well, however. It doesn't have the irreverence or gossipy tone of books that followed, such as Ball Four. I found, therefore, that the book could be slow going in places. You do get an excellent view of the 1959-era baseball world, however.In summary, The Long Season is a good read for those who want to know more about baseball 50 years ago. If you aren't a hardcore fan, however, you probably will want to look elsewhere."
2,Not up to snuff,"Eh. I was expecting more frankly. Guess I'm used to books like Ball Four which I would give 5 stars. Not real dishy (this was '59 after all) but not real interesting either. I couldn't wait to finish it just to get on to something better. Brosnan *thinks* he's funny but I didn't laugh much at all. Two stars for it being about a subject I happen to like. Other than that, eh."
2,CD Labels,Again the wrong item. Discription is vague and not consice. You think you're getting one thing and wind up with another.
1,"Dense, pedestrian, and boring.","A rabid Dana Stabenow fan, I had no idea she had ever written SF. Now I know why this little-known aspect of her past is little-known. Written in 1991, the sequel to ""Second Star"" finds Star Svendotter leading an expedition and ""head(ing) out to the asteroid belt, man's last wild frontier, to make their fortune."" I trudged through this book, looking for any hint of the brillant talent that produced ""A Cold Day for Murder"" in 1992. Nothing. I found nothing. This book's only value lies in what came after it."
3,Star on a larger stage with a smaller part.,"Star Svensdotter while larger than life in Second Star was still a very compelling realistic character in a large comfortable and comprehensible setting. Well let's exclude the librarian. In A Handful of Stars I found her character not as well drawn, nor as clear and decisive. The settings likewise were not as clear and crisp. Still it is a nice story with lots of growth in almost all the other characters. Situations while interesting where not as dramatic, shedding a greater light on the environments and less on the larger than life Star."
4,"Placemats, Waterford","These placemats were exactly what I wanted. I can dress them up or dress them down, depending on the occasion. The price was great too!"
4,Her favorite,This is not my favorite book. I don't like the pictures and the flaps are flimsy. But this book has something my daughter loves. She picks it every time. She loves finding Stretch in every picture and is thoroughly entertained by the story. If only I didn't have to suffer through it! We bought it when she was one and she's now two and still wants it read to her.
5,The Best,"I first heard of Craig Hayes at a Sunday evening service in the Bronx. They were on program with Jae Nixon and a few other locals. I mean when Craig and the choir sung they did it with conviction. It was worth staying past 11 pm to hear them. I have every release most on cassette, but I got my money's worth and then some.Craig and the rest of the choir you are still high on my list of gospel artist. I'm currently in Nashville and no one here has never heard of you all. Get here in a hurry!!!!!!!!!!!Be blessed."
3,Identity Crisis,"""Unconditional"" is a wonderful song, expressively performed by Clay Davidson---too bad the rest of the collection doesn't reach this pinnacle. I'm starting to get an audio identity crisis with these singers. Clay Davidson. Mark Wills. Craig Morgan. Wade Hayes. Tim McGraw. Kenny Chesney. Clay Walker. They all do great jobs, but sometimes there's little difference in their stylings, arrangements, and songs, that I never knew who I'm listening to. Clay needs to find some better material and capitalize on his sensitivity and stop trying to be every country singer in the world."
5,One of the Best,"Clay Davidson definately has another hit with ""Sometimes"" to follow ""Unconditional"". He is one of the few new truly country artists left with the onslought of people using country to break into the pop charts. This CD is definately worth the money. He has a great voice, and some great songs on this CD. If you only have enough money for one CD, this one is the one you buy."
4,Good....... for a musical,"For a musical, this movie wasn't bad. I didn't really like the whole musical thing but the songs were catchy and and none of them were alike. The play had a great variety of music like Hip-hop, Country western, Elvis style, and many more. The plot of this movie was predictable but good. I liked the idea of the school set, and the teachers being the actors. In conclusion I belive that this movie is good."
4,My comparison,"I saw this production 3 times in Chicago. The first 2 withDonny Osmond, and I then I listened to the CD a thousand timessince. Last Christmas I saw the version that is now traveling with Patrick Cassidy and Debbie Gibson as the narraator. It was a disappointment because it wasn't the props or sparkle the I remembered. Seeing this video was a HUGE reminder to what I loved best about this. Not just Donny, but its the original costumes and props. There were very few differences, and the ones there were didnt ruin it for me. The reason I say 4 stars is I really disliked the narrarator in this. Sometimes it seemed like she was going horse and I that bothered me. I have waited over a year for this to be released and it was well worth it."
3,Not the original cast,"I was disappointed to find that so much of the prime cast was replaced by ""stars"".Who's brilliant idea was that anyway?I'd rather have a copy of the real thing. I'm glad I saw it before I bought it."
5,Pity I Didn't Buy it Here!,"""Joseph"" has got to be one of the most refreshing musicals I have watched in recent memory. I found myself knowing the words to each of the songs by heart by the end of the tape. A part of the storywriting I enjoyed was the fact that the teachers of the school where this play is being performed turn up playing some of the characters. That kind of tricky casting work makes a musical even more enjoyable to watch. And, the clincher to my purchase of this tape was, it was by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Unfortunately, I didn't buy it here, and consequently spent more and waiting longer for it. Oh well..."
4,Joseph & the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat - Not Bad,I saw the Toronto stage production twice (with Donny Osmond) and loved it. The DVD is almost as good as being there again. My only complaint is that the megamix at the end is played over the credits rather than with the performers as in the stage version. Donny was great (of course!).
1,Horrible!,"This was the absolute worst version of Joseph that I have ever seen. And what makes it bad --- the awful performace by Maria Friedman as the Narrator. Anyone who knows Joseph knows that the Narrator must belt, but Friedman simply cannot belt and it brings down the overall production of the show."
3,Joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat,"Althouth it took longer than usual to receive the tape, it looks good and plays well and I'm satisfied with the transaction."
1,Big Disappointment,"Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school, resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults. The music is good, but the narrator makes faces, and Danny Osmond with long hair and half-shaven looks like he just woke up from sleeping on the street. My advice if you have this video is to close your eyes, and just listen to the music."
1,tastless movie,"I have heard great things about Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. This was just not my cup of tea. I thought the singing and the characters were horrible. Some of the clothing was very suggestable in my opionion. I would not recommend this video at all. Though others who gave it a bad review, said they had seen better ones done live. So i am going to try to keep an open mind and try to go to a live one in a theater near by, where maybe I will be able to see what everyone is talking about. The whole movie just left me bored and wasn't a movie that inspired my and my faith. It was cheesy to say the least."
3,"Like Any Dream, this DVD will do...","This production was meant for the stage, and unfortunately, the video makes that glaringly clear. I really wish there was a DVD of the STAGE production available. But there isn't, so this will do. I actually saw this before I saw any stage productions, and it's not bad. It's just not great. I really do NOT like the Potifer scene at all. It's...well...strange, cheap, and...I don't know...just kind of creepy. I do love Donny Osmond...he is fantastic! And the narrator here is still the best I've heard, video or stage. It's worth getting for a reasonable price. Enjoy it, but don't expect to be ""wowed."""
4,terrific!,my kids and I have viewed this MANY times since we received it. my only complaint is the variability in sound quality - very hard to hear the first part.
5,Hard To Find Items,"I had seen this movie on PBS years ago, and wanted a ""good"" movie to show my grandchildren. It's a really good one. I had to go out and by the CD to play in the car while going back and forth to school."
5,about Joseph,"Movie was great-saw live performance in Dallas with Jon Secada playing lead. I think his voice is better than Donny's but Donny sounded good, too.A great family movie, especially if there are any music lovers or budding singers watching"
2,If you like cats you'll love this video,"However, if you found Cats silly and lacking in plot, you'll pass this one by.It opens well, but as it goes on it just gets silly, and lacks Biblical correctness.As far as family viewing, some may not appreciate seeing Donny Osmond practically gang raped or Joan Collins nipple costume.Joseph King of Dreams (a cartoon) is better."
1,This movie stinks!,I've seen this play performed in several youth stage programs and I loved it. I saw this movie and was deeply disappointed. The singing was alright but everything else about the movie was horrible. The directing was bad and the characters seemed to be making fun of the story instead of portraying it as a true event that actually happened. After seeing it I feel that the rating should be at least PG-13 because of the many sugestive scenes and revealing costumes. If you are thinking of buying the movie I suggest you rent it first.
2,Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,"I was disappointed in the DVD version of Joseph. The background looks like a cartoon. The Broadway production was awesome, but the DVD is nothing like it. The music is the same, but moves slower on the new release. Rent it before you buy it."
1,Wonderful Play Gone Bad,"This is yet another example of an excellent musical play made into a horrible movie. The original play was purposefully set in unrealistic situations, but at the same time the music was of excellent quality. The movie has taken the play and turned it into a comedy that is not funny. The music has become farce. Beautiful semi-classical style music from the play has been dumbed down into cheap rock junk. The singers exaggerate emotions so much that it borders on ridiculousness. Nowhere is this more present than in the narrator's horrible exaggerated singing style. The only bright spot in this movie is Donny Osmond's singing quality. He seems to be the only actor in the movie who uses breath support while singing."
2,Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,I liked how they had so many different types of music that they sang. And I liked how they had all of the kids singing too. Another thing that I liked was that the teachers were the acters.
1,thumbs down,"All the children magically popping up, some bad makeup, and a few sad tries at being funny is what makes this movie deserve such a low rating. I think they could have come up with a better Joseph than D. O.. I have seen it 6 times in live theater, and every time the show was better than the movie."
5,Amazing Dreamcoat!,I bought this DVD for my 2 daughters for Christmas and they love it! Every time they watch it now they sing along with every song. This is a must for any family who loves to get together to watch a great Musical!
4,Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,"This is a very fun movie for kids and adults. Very bright and colorful, too. Donny Osmond is on the top of his ""game."""
4,We Love Musicals,"We purchased this because my oldest daughter was wanting to try out for a local production of this musical and wanted to familiarize herself with the music. We really like the music in it and Donny Osmond was great as Joseph. There were times that it seemed to drag a little, but once it picked up it was engaging."
3,Pretty good...,"To me, the video was ok, but it wouldn't exactly be a preference to me. It was comical in some parts, and the plot flowed smoothly. I didn't like the fact that is was a musical, but I believe it portrays the theme very well. And in the musical sense, there are songs for just about any type of music fan. They have everything from slow ballads to upbeat disco. The best song was probably when the pharoah imitated Elvis. I would highly recommend this movie to you musical fans out there, and even some others."
2,Not a family bible story,"Great music, great story, mostly wonderful presentation, but there is a surprising amount of slutty wardrobes. Shirtless Donny isn't an issue to me an my family. It is the highly provocative costumes of many females (Potiphar’s wife and dancers around Pharaoh quickly come to mind) makes this inappropriate for families. Surprisingly provocative for a bible story retelling. Inappropriately so."
1,PATHETIC AND AMATEURISH PRODUCTION,JOSEPH etc was a great and memorable show on stage (if rather short). This production is appalling and amateurish and the staging is on the cheap side. Many cast members are seen looking directly at the camera when they should not be doing so.It looks terrible.Who directed this rubbish.The Jason Donavan London stage show was far superior.Get a copy of that is you can.It's brilliant.Wait for a better version.This one is woeful and forgettable.
3,Joseph record,"Reasonaby good production and accurate record of musical play. Donny Osmond and Maria Friedman as excellant, as is the ensemble cast."
4,An interesting way of telling the story,Well done musical which displayed Donnie Osmond's vocal talents well. He truly is a gifted performer
5,I love it!,"I remember watching a production of this musical in my country over ten years ago. So I bought both the CD and this version with Donnie Osmond. I find it amazing how Webber and Rice were able to make such a great musical from a few passages in the Bible. And they must have been so young when they did it! There is an innocence and catchiness to the entire musical. And like the Bible, it is very timeless. I can identify with the character when he goes through all his trials.I would listen to the CD over and over and watch the video as well. I never get tired of it. A great buy."
4,Improves with age...,"I thought this was a pretty good video. In response to one comment, I also wasn't wild about Maria Friedman compared to Laurie Beechman, but I warmed up to her on my second viewing. As for alternatives, a great choice would have been Liz Callaway, formerly of Cats, Anastasia, etc. Also, I don't know how much more complete this version could have been, other than the megamix, which was irrelevant anyway. If you have a choice, get the DVD because the documentary is worth watching."
5,Fun!,"I found this video presentation of ""Joseph"" just as entertaining and fresh as the several theater productions I have seen. The challenge of presenting a stage play on video was met with very favorable results. If you want to watch a fun musical, I recommend this great show at a great price."
3,"Good, but just misses the mark for me","Unlike most of the reviewers below, I had never seen Joseph prior to viewing this DVD. While I'm sure I'll watch it enough times to justify the purchase, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. Andrew Lloyd Webber fans buying this blind, as I did, may want to rent it first. The music and lyrics aren't in the same league as subsequent works by Webber and Tim Rice.That said, I did enjoy this production. Donny Osmond turns in a great performance in the lead role. The costumes and sets, while garish, are in keeping with the tone set by Rice's tongue-in-cheek lyrics. If you like DTS, you'll be happy to know this DVD contains both DTS 5.1 and DD 5.1 soundtracks. There is also a nice making-of documentary among the several extras."
4,don't you love Andrew Lloyd Webber?,"this is a great video produced by the composer of the music of this musical.I enjoyed the Phantom, Love never dies, and Joseph. It tells the biblical story of Jacob and his many sons and the conflict with joseph. We only recognised two songs here in Australia as I don't remember this musical coming here. For lovers of music and spectacles this video is well worthwhile."
4,Very Entertaining,"Donny Osmond and Maria Friedman (the Narrator) were outstanding! My whole family loved watching the video. I was, however, a bit disappointed in Joan Collin's attire since it is billed a ""Family Musical""."
1,incorrect region code,"Bad News ! The DVD what I purchased from you, I cannot see, you send a copy with an "" Incorrect Region Code "" which in South Africa I cannot play back. I spent lots of money to purchase, and to receive the parcel at the post office, but it is too much trouble to send it back.Therefore I justleave it as it is but of course, I amnot happy with the transaction. Regards Attila Sauzet"
1,Short but boring.,"AS an admirer of the great JC Superstar and Cats, I expected much. But, this was really disappointing. What's the point? What's the narrator for? Songs are weak (no memorable song). Nothing special in story. No enjoyable dance. Strange mood of adult (costumes! and even the narrator herself). And school boys and girls...for what? I really enjoyed JCS and Cats movie but I cannot recommend this(Joseph) at all. Boring and nothing enjoyable."
1,Terrible!,"I was given this movie as a gift. not only is it inaccurate, but they imply a lot of sexual interest in Mrs.Potifer when Joseph had none! he was trying to get away. they don't do much with the choreography and they have they narrator interacting with the characters. if your life story was being told as you lived it you wouldn't see the narrator. yes, I realize that it's a movie (& originally theator) but really! some accuracy would be nice!"
1,NOT for children,"We bought this DVD for our kids -- but I'm glad we watched it before showing it to them. The movie is a ""irreverent"" version of the bible story, and the sexual innuendo, not to mention the revealing and suggestive costumes, makes it unsuitable for kids."
2,The Silliest Musical Ever Made,"Even for the musical genre, even for the Christian theme genre, this movie is silly beyond words, without being funny.It is ""Springtime For Hitler"" as envisaged by Zero Mostel in the Producers with every trite dance move ever invented.Joseph's brothers as would be Elvis/Billy Ray Cyrus impersonators takes the cake."
1,"A terribly inaccruate version of the story, not worth it...","This movie is not worth the cash it takes to get it, a terribleshowing of the original story -- it almost makes fun of it. It doesall people in it injustice. If your looking for something that gets the bang for for buck, this isn't it."
3,I DONT LIKE THE SINGING,"The movie is bad. They sing the entire time and it sounds horrible. There were a few things that were good, but overall the movie was bad. The plot was fairly good, but I just can't stand the singing. The movie would have been better without the singing."
3,Not for kids,"Many of the costumes in this production are bodysuits, designed to make it look like the actors are nude except for bits of strategic glitter. If it were rated, this video would garner a PG. This will not be objectionable to most people, but this video is being marketed as a ""show for the whole family"", and if you are a conservative parent, you may not want your kids watching it. For a good laugh, pick up the video box in your local video store and look at the picture of Joan Collins on the back. Her costume (which normally makes her look like she's topless) has been carefully colored in on the top!That warning aside, it's a fairly good video. I did not care for the way the show was framed as a production at a school, and the children's chorus was actually annoying in spots. However, most of the excitement and fun of the stage production comes through, and Donny Osmond is fabulous as Joseph."
3,Joseph - better entertainment than theology,"While there is plenty of ""poetic license"" (as well as ""theological license"" that will make you want to keep yourCatechismandBiblehandy! Note to Tim Rice & Andrew Lloyd Weber, for example: Angels are NOT human beings who have died!) and some unnecessary bawdiness, this is - in general - a highly entertaining production."
4,Osmond's Finest Hour!,"Amazing is the first word that comes to mind. The songs are so catchy that every time I watch it I catch myself humming them for the next 3 days. The characters are very well cast, and very funny. The choreography and staging was very well done. Bravo!My only gripe is those awful blue girls in the Pharoah scene. . .they look disgusting. Get rid of them, and put a little more clothing on Mrs. Potiphar and her girls, and I think this would be a a 5 star musical, and one that I would even aspire to audition for myself sometime."
5,Joseph and The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,This movie was so amazing that it blew me away. I absolutely loved it. The music and cast is fantastic. When I want to watch a beautiful musical with great songs and storylines I pop this in to the VCR. Buy It! You will love it!
4,A worthy effort,"This is a pretty good version of one of the funniest musicals I've ever seen. Let's start with the bad: Some of the vocals on this video could have been better. Maria Freedman and Richard Attenborough were not good choices in my opinion. My biggest gripe is that they didn't include the megamix on this video. Now for the good: Robert Torti as Pharoh is really funny. He does an excelent job. Donny does a decent job as Joseph he's not my first pick, but he's not bad at all. The brother's are all really funny (especially during Those Canon Days) If you like Joseph or have kids that you want to get interested in musicals you should get this video."
5,Forever a great story,We play this movie over and over. My daughter has just discovered Joseph and I enjoy taking it in as much as I did long ago.
2,Joseph DVD,This particular DVD had some sound troubles. At times the volume would go down and it was hard to hear. Then it would go up and be too loud.I have another copy of this musical and it had no problems so I think I just got a faulty DVD.
3,"Technically and musically good,","A very lavish production. Technically well done. a little lacking in acting ability. Musically excellent. Movement from ancient story to modern school is a little awkward. Overall, an enjoyable show."
2,more scenery than i cared for,"I bought this based on a recommendation from church. Donny and Maria sing superbly, but my objections deal with the costumes. The skin-tight provocative dancers was totally unnecessary for a supposedly family-friendly version. And Joan Collin's outfit as Potiphar's wife was overboard as well. My boys turned there heads when watching it with me. I can not recommend this to others."
2,Poor sound weakens a great show,"After seeing the stage production, I had great hopes for this DVD and was eagerly looking forward to Dolby Digital 5.1. It turns out that the 5.1 encoding is so poor that the only way to listen to it is analog Dolby Pro Logic. In chapter four for example, the brothers and narrator are center stage but only the narrator's voice comes out through the center channel - the brothers are ""lost"" in the left and right channels. This is not the case with analog decoding. Also, 5.1 levels are a good 10-15 db below where they should be and 10 db below the analog. This is the poorest 5.1 mix I have ever seen.This was so bad that I sent the first DVD back and Amazon graciously exchanged it for another. The second was just as bad.If you have a Dolby Digital, don't bother, unless you want to use the analog channel."
4,One of the Best of all Time!!,"The value of this DVD is great. The brothers are a Motley Crew and the interaction of the Narrator is also original. I do feel that some of the musicality and singing is compromised by the dubbing of some of the voices. Also the soundtrack is more exciting than what we hear when watching the movie. However, the stage settings are great and I really enjoyed the special feature of the history of Joseph. You should not pay more than $15 for this DVD.. Making it a great value."
3,Only for diehard fans,"I would just as soon watch a High School production of this great musical than watch the video. Donny did a great job, but Maria Friedman as the narrator lacks power. The sets were great, the costumes fun (although a bit risque) and the concept of the audience in a drab gym was a great idea. Overall this video lacks the energy of most soundtracks available and they seemed to rush through each number. This is, however, an excellent introduction to musical theater and I hope this (along with the Cats video) will just lead to more Weber on video."
5,Kids are still singing the songs!,"Our family loved it! Video and sound (DTS) were excellent on the DVD. The music is infectious. The Potapher costumes were a little risque for my tastes, but our 7 & 5 year olds didn't notice it at all. Both Freidman and Osmond were outstanding. Our daughter wants her school to do ""Joseph"" next year. I am ordering a cast CD right now!"
4,Joseph entertains wonderfully!,"I ordered this video to use as a wrap-up for a unit I was doing on musicals with my 3rd and 4th graders. They really enjoyed watching it and absolutely loved the music. For many, this was their first exposure to a musical. There were some parts where the women were very ""scantily clad"", and that, of course, got a big reaction out of them - I reassured them that the actresses were wearing costumes to make them ""look like they're not wearing anything."" Even being a pro actor myself, I have little criticism for this video."
2,"Can we say ""overproduced""?","I agree wholeheartedly with Donald-from-Ohio's review. I've been a fan of this Lloyd Weber/Rice musical for 20+ years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available. Having never had the opportunity to see the stage production, I was eager to see this video. Now I realize that perhaps this musical is one to be heard and not seen, at least not beyond an unpretentious summer camp or youth group presentation, the perfect venues for this show. Yes, Osmond performs nicely in the role of Joseph. But everything else about this production is so overdone that watching it, for me, is like seeing a favorite childhood friend grow up to become a cheap circus performer. The two stars I give this video are for the music itself. But I certainly don't understand why Lloyd Weber chose to add the FINALE song ""Any Dream Will Do"" to the BEGINNING of the show."
3,Joseph is okay...BUT,"I absolutely love both the Canadian cast and the Broadway cast soundtracks, so I was excited to see this production. I wish I could say that I was excited to HAVE seen it, but it was just okay. Donny Osmond does a great job...he's the best thing in here. I know Maria Friedberg is an up and coming name in musical theatre, but I was extremely disappointed in her performance. Her voice doesn't have the strength of the leads on the cast recordings, and she mugged her way through a lot of the numbers, which would work on stage, where everything needs to be exaggerated, but doesn't work here. (To be fair, most of the cast does the same.) It was a little distracting that the singing on some of the numbers was not syncronized with the actors' lip movements. It's better than nothing though, and everytime Donny Osmond takes center stage you forget the flaws."
5,Amazing,"All memebers of our family liked it a lotAll members from age 3 to 33:)My three years old daucher keeps singing: Potiphar had had a few cares, he was one of Egypt's millioners.I doubt she understand what she's singing but performance and music are amazing."
4,Good for children...,"In the 1980's, our church school put together a production of ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" and had a lot of fun doing it. The songs are easy for children to learn and the words tell the Bible story. You could use the video as a teaching tool.If you're watching the video for entertainment and not over 40, you won't get some of the more subtle original detail. For example, in the orginal, the Pharoh was dressed like Elvis Pressly in his famous white bell-bottomed suit covered with rhinestones--you know--the Pharoh as the ""King."" When I saw this perfomed live in the 1970's the crowd went nuts when ""Elvis"" sprang onto the stage. Of course, most of those present knew who Elvis was and many had seen him perform live.Donny Osmond has a nice voice, and the back-up singers are great, but I found this version a bit of a letdown."
3,"Great show, bad moments.","I didn't like it the first time I saw it, but I gave it a second chance and LOVED IT!!!!!! The problem? SOME COSTUMES ARE TOOOOO SHOWY. I mean, I can understand the whole Mrs. Potiphar and Joseph thing, but the way to leggy apachi dancer wooing scene. Now was THAT necessary? Anyway, it is better for 8 and up, but it was a really good movie."
2,"Good production, poor sound","This is a fun staging of a fun show. Certainly not deep, thought-provoking theater, but a fun little show nonetheless. However, I must echo the sentiments of those reviewers who said the sound on this DVD leaves much to be desired. The sound level on the vocals is extremely inconsistent, with some soloists being nearly inaudible. In fact, the sound on this disc is so poor I must grudgingly encourage buyers to opt instead for the VHS version, which doesn't have this problem."
1,Waste of money,"One of the few musicals that I regret spending the money on because of the absymal recording quality. The narrator was fairly easy to understand, but some sound track key singers were almost inaudible.The tunes would have been most enjoyable if the technical quality was acceptable.As one who enjoys musicals and muscial shows, I was very disappointed in the recording quality and video quality."
1,Terrible sound quality!,"I had the VHS tape of this video and loved it, so I just recently purchased the DVD. Not thinking there was any reason to do so, I WISH I had read the customer reviews, as many of them commented on how terrible the sound quality of this DVD is. And I'm here to back them up. I have tried watching this on both my surround sound system and the television alone, and in both cases, it's horrible. Background singers and music are barely audible, but the narrator's part will blast out your ears if you turn up the volume to hear the music. What makes this even more disappointing is that Amazon will not refund your money in full."
3,"Entertaining, but...","I was very excited to find that this musical had been brought to video and that Donny Osmond would be playing Joseph. Typically, I am also very impressed with Maria Friedman, but I was disappointed by her role as the narrator. Also there were some parts of the production I found to be very cheesy. They would have worked if it had been set on a stage, but since it wasn't taken from that approach the cheesy antics didn't work. However, this can all be forgotten by a very strong and entertaining show once the reaches the scenes witht the Pharoah."
2,dumb & dumber,I didn't like the video. How could all Joseph's brothers be of a different race? Are we trying to be politically correct or WHAT? Also I wish Donny had kept his shirt on. I was turned on by his hairy chest. I have seen this performed twice by groups other than Donny and co. and enjoyed it so much more. Give it up Donny!!
2,Buy the soundtrack instead.,"Joseph lovers; you will be disappointed with this film. Family viewing it is not. Potiphar's wife and her servants are definitely R rated, and you may be embarrassed to watch this with your children. The narrator is breathy and sexy, which may work in some venues, but not when she is narrating a Bible story to a grade school assembly. Rent it and get it over with, but you'll probably grate at the slow musical pace."
2,Disappointment,"Having seen the play, and loving the colorful, musical presentation of Joseph's story, I was disappointed to see the movie cheapening the theatre experience. The ""narrator"" is a modern woman who doesn't blend into the story at all, but is present in almost everything. The audience of children are included in the movie which also detracts from the play itself. The performers are talented and accomplished, but the above distractions ruined the experience for me."
3,not as good as expected,"I was disappointed in this video. I found Maria Friedman annoying and as others have said weak vocally. Donny Osmond sang great but I couldn't put him visually into the role. Maybe he is a little too old for it,"
2,What was that!,"I was excited about this movie coming out... I had read all the updates on the reallyuseful web site which is the official page and when it came on tv I was really happy... notice the word WAS really happy. The movie started out ok, interesting school asembly concept, then it went WHOOP down hill! The narrator didn't do justice to her role and the children cheering were unbeleiveably annoying. It seemed more like a music video than anything else. I was also dissappointed by the brothers who were a bit too gay to my liking. I was expecting somewhat straighter brothers, no offense to anyone who is gay but it was not what I had in mind. The movie did have some good parts though like Donny's ""Close Every Door To Me"" but then a very unentertaining Pharoah brought it down again w/ his terrible impression backed up with not what I would call the 'best' choreography. I love this show but I just cant find anything... ""amazing"" about this video."
3,Joseph's Dreamcoat,"I was very pleased with the rapid delivery without having to pay extra. I loved the stage play version , and the music , but the dvd-version leaves something to be desired. I was dismayed that the producers felt it necessary to use near/nudity for the Egyptian female's costumes - totally not necessary - more like something you would expect in a Las Vegas burlesque show!"
4,Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat,"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat was a very entertaining movie. I really enjoyed the way they displayed the scenes and the costumes of each character. The actors were very creative with their lines and parts in the movie. I also enjoyed the way the actors brought other people from everyday life into their parts as their specific character. A big example of this was how the pharoah had many Elvis qualities in his character. In conclusion, I really enjoyed this movie and it will always be a classic."
3,"Ok movie, but....","This is an OK movie. The movie was pretty funny at times. I thought the sets were very cool. I don't really like the all the singing in the movie. It would have been better if this movie only had a few scenes with songs. The songs were catchy, and I don't really like that. They had a ton of music types in the movie, like country, rap, Elvis, etc. The acting was also good. I would really only recommend this movie to someone that likes singing or musicals."
4,Mary Barton (Penguin Classics),"I love the author, Elizabeth Gaskell, and have read a couple of her books. Although I haven't read this book yet I look forward to it. I've found a new ""favorite"" author."
3,A 19th Century Soap Opera,"This was the selected book for November for our Book Club. A typical Gaskell work: 18th century wordiness -- a slow read. Plot was much like current soap operas: just when you think all the problems will be resolved, another twist and turn is thrown in. Just not my cup of tea."
2,Exhuberant,"A good quality novel, with somewhat a cheavanistic attitude on life. It complies with known faculties and derives from Dickens and 'Hard Times.' END"
5,10 starts...not just 5,"Little Einsteins are absolutely delightful in all angles. Worth the extra dollars for the book compared to the others. You'll never find Little Einsteins or RoliePolie Olie for 2.50 on the Walmart rack, because this is a good quality book that your child will love. Great color, great quality in paper for a paperbook.**Here's a helpful tip----leave your child the inexpensive, dollarstore hardcover or boardbooks on the floor for your child to read on his/her own, but put these more expensive and better quality books up high on a shelf for supervised ""special moments"" when you read together. This way the book is always taken care of for repeated reading which everyone enjoys. **"
2,Mistitled,"My problem with this book is that it is wrongly titled by the reprint publisher (it was originally published in 1925) something that the current editor must have gone along with. The correct title is The New Negro: An Interpretation. This is important for two reasons. All sorts of sloppy readers are citing the book as The New Negro: Voices of the Harlem Renaissance (1925) when no such book exists. Second, the writer of the introduction criticizes the book for not covering a variety of aspects of the Harlem Renaissance when that was not the book's intent. It was ""an interpretation!"" It allows for other interpretations. Nevertheless, it remains one of the best interpretations because it covers more areas of literary and social interpretation of 1925 than any other. Unfortunately, the stunning color illustrations by Winold Reiss that made the book a hot seller in the 1920s are not reproduced in this slick money maker edition."
3,Superdate,"I actually got this book because I interviewed the author on the radio and promised her I would read it. Some decent advice, I guess..."
2,"so close, yet so far... i give 5 stars for effort.","i wanted to like this documentary very badly. i was completely excited when i received it. this had Unwound, Sleater-Kinney, The Make-Up and many others. some parts are genuinely interesting. but unfortunately nothing was given that i could really enjoy. the sound makes some (not all) of the live footage fairly unlistenable and the footage so dark i can barely see the people in some parts. mostly i wanted to see Unwound, what a horrible shock to find that halfway through their performance commentary starts playing! i was angered and felt cheated. the interviews were safe and boring, offered nothing new and some of the people were unbearable to hear talk. it was such a great idea and i wanted to love it from the beginning. maybe my expectations were too high?"
4,Looks just like our real black lab,Gave this to my wife on Valentines day to put at her work office to have to reminder her of our real black lab Shelby. She loves it.
4,Beyond The Five Senses,"This is a lovely book full of nuggets of wisdom, however I wouldn't recommend it to the beginner on the spiritual path. It deals with angels, most of us can deal with that, but it also deals with fairies & gnomes. I can't say that I've ever been aware of them, but I would not flatly say that they don't exist. I've experienced stranger, but wonderful things. If fairy tales are too far out for you--well forget it, but if you have an open mind, it's a great book full of wisdom. The style reminds me of The Book Of The True Life (The Third Testament) which is Jesus oriented, but believes in reincarnation. It is the first book of White Eagles that I have bought & when I get done writing this I'm buying 2 more."
4,"Good shaver, maybe not the best Remington makes","I got this to replace my older (but newer model) MS2-390. The 200 is just as good a shave, but the battery lasts about 3-5 days, where the 390 would go a whole week before needing recharged. I got the factory-refurbished, and the pop-up trimmer doesn't go half-way, like one adjustment should, which is not a big deal, just a slight miss of quality control. Overall, I like the Remington Titanium MicroScreen shavers more than any other that I've had, including a Braun, and a Panasonic. I just don't think the best ones need to be as expensive as they are, and that's why I compromised for a lesser model. They do the same job with a quick, close, daily shave, but maybe without all the bells and whistles."
1,100% Worthless,"I bought this shaver because it was cheap. I figured even if it doesn't shave very well, I could at least use it as a trimmer for beard and sideburns. I was wrong. This thing does not cut hair. At all. I honestly can't fathom how it made it to market; it fails completely, and I mean totally and fully, 100%, at its intended primary function.Avoid at all costs. Do yourself a favor, spend a few more bucks, and get a rotary Norelco."
1,A Disappointment!,"I had thought this would be full of dried fruits and nuts ( in other words, healthful) but it's really just sugar laddened bits of hard fruits and only flavorless peanut pieces. I have given the local food bank all but the one package I opened which made me feel so unwell that it's now in the rubbish. I am truly very disappointed in this product. It's description belies it's reality. If sugar is contraindicated in your diet....steer clear of this product!! It's low in salt and low in fat but so over sugared as to be actually nauseating. It's too bad because it sounded delicious and so nutritious. All I can say is YUK!!! I suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar is good for you."
2,All the flavors of the farmer's market...if your farmer harvests only sugar...,"These types of fruit mixes live or die on the basis of how well the flavors in the package complement one another. The best of these kinds of things mix sweet fruit with sour or salty or chocolate or something else.Not this one. It's just cloyingly sweet on top of cloyingly sweet. There are several types of dried fruit in the bag, but there's so much added suger they all taste the same. Basically, everything is a little sweeter than normal raisins. This may appeal to the kids in your house, but the adults will want to approach this stuff with caution. You might be able to make this stuff edible by mixing it yourself with other (less sweet) things, but taken as-is you'll probably consider this mix to be almost inedible in anything but modest amounts."
2,$39.99 ??!!??,"I heard Canon on an iTunes radio channel, went immediately to buy, but I cannot imagine a CD worth $40+."
5,Yes !,"I rarely give 5 stars to anything. This book is in the top 2 or 3 computer books I've ever read. The author uses a +5 pronged approach to teach. Most books don't even use 3! He explains the general concept very well, then provides relevent small examples, questions (with answers) at the end of chapters, then a magna cum example in a separate chapter, and what's more he uses diagrams very generously.I agree with the other reviewers - FANTASTIC!If anyone knows of a better beginner-intermediate C++ book, please send me an e-mail, titled ""BETTER C++""."
5,"Simple, easy, fun to read, and uses relevant examples","Lafore does a great job of holding your hand while learning C++. This is definitely a book for beginners who are interested in learning C++. Also does not assume you have any prior experience with C (a drawback I found for a lot of books when first getting into C++.) The really great thing about Lafore's style is that he explains the topic, gives a parabolic example, shows you the code, and then goes back and dissects the code line by line explaining what each statement does. Again, this is great for learning C++, even if it is your first language. Don't come here though if you're looking for windows programming. Great Job!"
5,Excelent book!!!,"This book is great for novices who want to learn C++.You don't need to have programming experience. The many examples are very well explained and will lead you quickly to a satisfactory level of knowledge.The book is easy to read despite its size(about 800 pages). Although it covers many issues, it is not for reference and it doesn't cover windows programming.But the author states all these facts and doesn't deceive you.One big bravo to Lafore for writing such a good book!!!"
3,Neat book :D,"The section on coloring was nice actually; its pretty informative regarding the history of the industry, the professional terminology, and the aspects of coloring. The process of coloring that they run you through is interesting but a little vague on how its done. For my money its almost better to get the Hi Fi Coloring book by Image.The Lettering section is pretty informative, I still have to go back and read the last of it but it was written pretty well so far."
4,Helpful,"This book is a great help to my comics work as well as my illustration and fine art work. It gives great instructions for traditional and digital coloring and lettering. Though some of the computer instructions are aimed more toward Mac users, and a little outdated, it is still very useful and gives you plenty of info to figure out how to do things on other systems. Great buy!"
1,Should be titled DC Comics Guide to Color Theory 101,"There is no truth in advertising here: This book will NOT show you how to color for comics. It will not tell you how to color ANYTHING. It will only vaguely explain the theory of color, the concept of ""Computers"" used for modern coloring but will show you NOTHING about technique. It's like a round-a-bout way of saying ""Here's what comics look like, do THAT"" without ever telling you HOW to actually DO anything.I was sorely disappointed with the content here.The lettering sections are competent I suppose, although my disbelief with the coloring ""content"" made it hard for me to concentrate."
1,big on theory lacking in instruction,"I purchased this book thinking I would learn Photoshop techniques for coloring. There weren't any. It verily explained the terminology. If you are interested in the theory of why comic books are colored the way they are, this book is for you. If you want to learn the technical skills for coloring, this book is not for you."
2,A Little Hard to Swallow,"This book was fairly well-written, but I found some of the ""facts"" in this story pretty hard to believe. Youngblood contends that the events in the story are factual for the most part. But author Robin Moore is strangely silent. Moore never once claims that the book is non-fiction or is a biography. It is simply what Jack told him.The book reads like a teenage boy's fantasy, where Youngblood is a mixture between Han Solo and Indiana Jones, a rogue with a heart of gold. He can handle any gun and fly any plane. And all women love him, of course.Jack Youngblood is definitely a true character. But I believe that he is a bit prone to exaggaration. He reminds me a bit of the dad in the movie ""Big Fish"".If you would like to know more about Jack Youngblood, including links regarding his possible involvement in the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, (...)"
5,Amber the Cat,"Daughter sleeps with this toy every night and it gets carried around most of the day, love the cat beanie babies, great product, great price and quick shipping!"
4,Great rule book for loaded issue,"It was helpful to read an investment book that understood what my investment tendencies were, and yet, talked me out of repeating what hasn't been working so well. The psychological yet rational approach really spoke to me. It wasn't too dogmatic either. Enjoyable examples too."
3,Rent...then buy...,"Sorority Boys has it laughs and its high points in the love department; but, the movie really lacks feeling and emotion one usually feels with movies. I feel there were many times in the movie where they tried to hard. This movie is good to rent and watch maybe once but after that if you like it invest in it, yet, I feel once was plenty for me."
3,Sorority Boys - Great fun,"If you're looking for intellectual college fun, this ain't the movie for you. This is pure fun. The movie itself is not very good. In fact, the storyline is pretty stupid. However, if all you're wanting is to watch three boys making fools of themselves (and learning a bit about themselves in the process), then this is the movie for you. Michael Rosenbaum is fantastic as Adam/Adina, who, of the three main characters, seems to have learned most from his 'experience' as the opposite sex. Everything Adam did to girls gets heaped on him tenfold as Adina. Does he learn his lesson? Not really. But, he seems a better man for it in the end. All three learn little lessons along the way, but it's their escapades as the fairer sex that make this movie worth a viewing. 1 star for plot--5 stars for funny."
3,Stupid funny,"I bought this movie to reminisce with my brothers. Halfway through, it was no longer funny. If you want easy laughs, and nothing clever, and with a bunch of really bad gender stereotypes, this movie is for you."
5,I have a puppy named barry watson,The movie was the best I've ever seen. Only 40 Days & 40 Nights was better. Could have used more nudity
4,Guilty Pleasure for Super Stress Days,"I don't know if there's a guy out there who would like this movie. Lord knows I never even dreamed of running it for hubby. But on a very stressed out day for me, where my brain was overexhausted by work on this computer, I must confess this film did the trick. I enjoyed and laughed at this slight confection of three frat guys who are forced to pledge the girl's sorority on campus which houses all the ""dog"" girls. The 3 of them are members of the biggest hell raising frat on campus but they must lurk undercover while being suspected of stealing the frat's cruise fund. The reason this works is that the 3 lead guys are surprisingly likable and cute, whether in drag or out. The one who was the worst with the ladies has one of his own frat brothers pursue him as a woman and it is very funny when he walks the frat's Hall of Shame. He slugs a few of those same brothers (as a woman) and that is a great moment. All in all, a fun diversion."
3,"""Clear The Way For Buttzilla""","The '02 film `Sorority Boys' is a raunchy but extremely funny film within the ever popular genre first made popular by films like the '78 classic `Animal House' with a touch of 'The Longest Yard' for good measure.This teenage ""coming of age"" movie makes use of all the expected components of life on a college campus; all-night parties, lots of beer and grass, hot and loose young women and a storyline sprinkled with just enough hints of a redeeming subplot to make the audience feel like they're watching something meaningful.Add to the mix three frat guys dressed up like girls who receive a rude awakening when they experience how the ""other half"" live and you've got `Sorority Boys' in a nutshell.My Rating: I'm embarrassed to admit it but yes, I enjoyed the movie; -3 Stars-."
3,3 1/2 stars ...HILARIOUS!,"When I first heard of this movie I thought, NO WAY! Deciding to give it a chance was a right move. It was crude and funny through out. I'm sure it offended some. However, I dug it. And I did notice the film throws in a positive message. After being framed for stealing the frat house cash, three dudes turn to drag in order to get back in and prove their innocence. In doing so they must get their hands on a vhs tape that will indeed set things straight. The promise is a shue-in for setting things up for a comedy with good laughs. Just about every scene provides a belly laugh, chuckle or smile. So for some alternative American pie, have a slice of ""Sorority Boys""."
5,Hillarious!!,"Oh my, this movie is the best! Take it from me, its so0o0o0o0o0 funny.More than frat boys in womens clothing.It all starts when they are accused of stealing the money the whole house was saving , then they get kicked out. they are excepted to the d.o.g pledge house full of some weird gurls.All the boys make friends and help them through the whole time finding out about how bad women are treated.While they stay there they have a video tape at the house where u can see someone stealing the money and it wasnt them."
2,Stupidly funny.,"Sorority Boys is the dumbest, pointless, and offensive film of 2002. With that being said, this film does have some funny jokes and thanks to Michael Rosenbaum, he keeps this sex comedy from sinking fast. Rosenbaum has great comic timing which isn't always apparent since he plays Lex Luthor on Smallville, he gets to show his funny bone and he is a hoot! Barry Watson is quite pretty as a girl but this film is no Animal House. This film is a guilty pleasure, so it keep it a secret. Good luck!"
3,"Amazingly, I liked this movie","I must admit that I did enjoy this movie, though typically I would never rent it in a million years. The only reason I even watched it was because my wife rented it. As the movie started I figured I'd last about 15 min. because it looked to be so awful. But it grew on me and I got into it, and before I knew it I was laughing and enjoying it. It's the type of movie that is brain candy. It's simple and obvious jokes. But the reason it works is because of the characters in it, that's what hooked me. The bottom line is they're funny. If you can make it through the first 15-20 minutes you might just like it."
3,Stupid funny,"I many ways, Sorority Girls comes across as a successor to Animal House. It's got its own humor, but of course isn't as funny as the classic. There are some times when the characters just seem too dumb (like the blonde girl and guy disguised as a girl taking a shower - as if she wouldn't notice something odd...). Nonetheless, it is funny and might be worth checking out if you liked Animal House."
2,LAME.,Lame! Lame! Lame! Corny sexual humour. No wonder it tanked- if the Amazon.com thing is true. Because it's bad. Don't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world.
3,Bitter Yuck! is just that.,"This has been effective for my cat, who chews anything rubber coated like wires, or plastic like the edge of my computer monitor. The down side is it is hard to spray it precisely where you want it, and if you get enough of it around you can taste it in your sinuses and it is VERY NASTY STUFF. If you happen to get it on your hands, it takes several washings to get it off. It can get on your food and utensils and once it's on your mouth you have to just wait for it to go away. It may be ""water-based"" as claimed on the label, but it is very difficult to wash out."
1,Do not buy,I bought this for my dog and he did not stop chewing instead he dranked it like it was water this product does not work at all
1,How to remove off hands.,"Do not spray in air or on human skin. It is very difficult to remove odor, taste from hands, mouth, and anything you touch.The only thing I found to remove it from my hands was ""Black Jack Asphalt & Tar Remover"" found at Lowes or Home Depot.It claims to be gentle on skin and IT IS !!!! You can use it on clothes, tools, fabric, skin and hair. VOC compliant. Biodegradable, and 100% organic. I'm extremely allergic to all chemical, odors. Fortunately, I have a knowledgeable husband."
2,This is actually funny!,"My 7 month old puppy loves the taste of this spray! Needless to say, he eats whatever I spray it on. Sorry...wouldn't order this again! Not knocking the product at all..just had to say I thought it was funny that my dog LIKES it! hahahah!"
5,Works for our 10 month old pup!,"All dogs respond differently, and no one on here can tell you how your dog will respond to it. Id say, it only costs a little and could save you a lot in damages, so it is worth a try.However, It is working great for ours!! The main reason I wanted it was to keep our 10 month old rescue pup from grabbing and yanking my older dogs tail and neck scruff. He saw me spraying all his favorite chew things and was immediately weary, and has not touched them since. He isn't a huge chewer, but more of a sneaky chewer when you're not looking, every now and then. His jerking my other dog around by her bushy tail was getting pretty bad, and this has put a stop to that, so for that it is well worth a few bucks!!**As a word of warning, wear gloves when spraying and try to keep your mouth covered with something until you're finished applying!!"
1,Don't Bother.,"This product is pretty much a waste of money. My Walker Coonhound will not stop digging up a huge potted plant in my kitchen. I purchased this product because the label reads that it is gentle on skin, hair and plants. This claim is true - my dog, myself and the plant have not experienced any dry irritation or rashes from this product. However, the product does not live up to it's primary function - my dog does not refrain from chewing anything that I spray the Bitter Yuck on. If anything, she is more attracted to the plant now that it is (literally) drenched in Bitter Yuck. To make this purchase even more disappointing and annoying, I accidentally got the Bitter Yuck on my own hands and (somehow) my mouth and I cannot remove it no matter what I try. In short, if you want to stop yourself from biting your own nails, get this product. If you want to get your dog to stop chewing, I would suggest researching other products or ask your vet."
5,Much Respect,"If you thought Bleed's debut was hot, your gonna get roasted to this. ""My Own"" has a different sound than his first record, but that's what makes it great. He uses lots of samples from the 70's giving it southernplayalistic style that's unmatched. The message conveyed through his lyrics is more than just a mission about money and cheese and thuggin'. Ghetto celebrities Too Short and Daz found their way onto this record, but they are an afterthought. The narcotic effect of Bleed's southern drawl and story telling ability that spawned his first record just accelerates on My Own. Get this if you want to ""listen"" to a message, not just ""hear"" words."
4,saved,"Young Bleed left No limit just in time. if this one had been released on NL i would have left it on the shelf. he wouldve been another wasted talent. But he really established his credibility as a rapper on this one, hes just kinda taking his time on album #3. tracks with Too Short, daz, and others mean that he has a real future, hes not too tied to the whole no limit thing to grow."
2,superficial biography,I found this documentary to be superficial and inaccurate. During a discussion of Wallace it shows a picture of T. H. Huxley with the implication that it was Wallace. There was no discussion of Huxley.
2,underwhelming,This video was dull and pedantic. I would not recommend it for an insight into the life and work of Charles Darwin. Perhaps even misleading.I would really like a receipt for this purchase. How do I get it?
3,neither one nor the other,"I found this book too mathematical and very sparse when actually trying to help myself on an image processing course. It covers quite a lot of ground, but there's almost more math than english. You get the feeling the authors are very comfortable with this, and to be honest if you have done a maths-based degree it'll be fine for you. But then again, you may find it treats topics lightly and constantly refers to other papers, as if you live in a good science library or something."
5,Good Amount of Info.,"We've been using this book in the image processing class I'm taking. I've found it very useful. It covers a large range of topics and manages to cover the material with just enough detail.Cut-and-paste coders may want to look elsewhere, since this book stays away from code examples. Instead it uses a lot of algorithms. I've had little trouble implementing the filtering and segmentation techniques described in the book."
3,not for the mechanic,"This book covers a lot but if you are the practical kind who wants to know how things work and implement them fast, this is not the book for reference. Some chapters are good and are detailed and informative, while some others contain such sparse information that the atleast I was totally confused."
5,Hokey title. Great Book!,"Liz Greene is one of my favorites and I cherish every book of hers! I think the title a little hokey and think it was chosen because someone thought it would sell the book but IMO, not so much and does the content of the book a disservice. This is a one of the best astrology books for layman, describing sun signs and I highly recommend it every chance I get."
2,Simplistic description - poorly written,"The method itself is extremely interesting, unfortunately the authors repeat the same examples over and over again. Very annoying. The style borders on boring. I would recommend definitely reading the book from Savransky as a much better example of TRIZ"
5,A brilliant model of problem solving,"Using a perfect model, this books first introduces characteristics of GOOD solutions, then step by step, it describes triz problem solving tools (and strategy development tools as well) all integrated into each other.As stated in the title, it's a simplified book so you can't find some advanced tools like su-field modeling in it."
4,Unfair Review,"I think that the review posted for this book is exceedingly unfair. What Buckley tries to do is clear away some of the hypocrisy that has surrounded modern writing about ancient history. For generations books have been written by regurgitating the narratives of a few primary sources: Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, et al. Buckley puts this process in the foreground and allows teachers to amplify and to correct by appealing to inscriptions, coins, less ""privileged"" narratives and so forth. This is a dynamic text, which is really alone in a sea of pompous writers who aspire to the true account of what ""actually happened"" and don't want to let students in on the process. I fully intend to use this text in a course surveying Greek history. Everyone gets some details wrong, but I admire the basic honesty of this text."
4,Great Buy!!,"I have loved Anastacia for the longest time, and this is the final CD I needed for my collection. Her brassy, powerful voice really hold strong and true in this CD. If you love Anastacia, this is a CD that you should have!"
5,Best Buy,Quick delivery of this item in the holiday season.Better than I expected. Brand new Ty beanie babies goatee the goat with tag attached.
2,Not So Good,"I don't know if it was the time that it was made thet made it scary, because I didn't think it was. First of all there was no creepy atmosphere[blood, rust, dirt, any kind of grunginess], it was just 6 kids[very stupid ones] getting killed one by one in a non-scary/non-gory way. I expected so many more scares from this movie because of how it is always being praised as ""the best ensemble horror piece of all time"". I got more laughs from this movie[Franklin gets mad and runs in to a door/Sally is running through the woods and hits a branch]. It was too goofy for me to appreciate it. I got one scare from this movie, and that was it!! In a world of ""Godzilla"" and ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" this movie would be scary."
1,My GOD,"Literally the worst picture quality i have ever seen on a DVD. Not only did it detract from the movie experience, I was not scared in the least because i was too angry at the horrible picture. Don't get me wrong, it is one of my favorite movies of all time, but this DVD is absolutely and utterly a waste of money. Wait for the real special edition that I hope is coming. I cant believe those first two reviews. Obviously product placement by the publishing company. DONT BUY THIS!!!!"
1,THE FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER MADE!,"YOU MAY ASK WHY I THINK THIS MOVIE IS THE FUNNIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. WELL YOU SEE, THE MOVIE'S PLOT, ACTOR'S, AND SETTING IS SO INCREDIBLY STUPID THAT IT IS LAUGHABLE. MY FRIENDAND I RENTED THIS MOVIE AND EXPECTED IT TO BE SCARY. INSTEAD WE WERE ROLLING ON THE FLOOR WITH RED FACES AND TEARS COMING DOWN OUR EYES BECAUSE OF HOW STUPID, BUT HILLARIOUS THIS MOVIE IS. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HORROR MOVIE, SORRY IT'S NOT HERE. BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GREAT COMEDY, THIS IS THE MOVIE!"
2,Nothing Special,"Maybe I'm spoiled over the last twenty years or so with good fx and production. All that aside this low budget film fails to hit with the impact I was expecting. Poor production should not stop a film from being scarey. The first four killings were done rather quickly and without much fanfare; lacking suspense, detail or special effects. The last 30 minites or so picked up a little bit and kept your interest. In brief, it's worth checking out because of the legacy that was created and spawned since."
2,A Great Edition For A Horrible Movie,"I'm a B-movie fan, that's why I bought this DVD, because I felt like Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a must... But I still think this movie is [bad], unlike B-movies like Evil Dead that came after... This movie inspired many others, and that's why I think you still must watch it...The DVD is pretty fine... Trailers,TV Trailers, sequel trailers, deleted scenes, stills and almost everything a fan could ask... I'd give 1/5 stars for the movie and 3/5 stars for the edition. The menus are interactive, actually, the main menu is really great...So, for you all TCM-fans, this DVD is a total must have... For us, B-movie fans... it's, atleast, worth a rent... A great edition, full of extras (image and sound are so-so). Worth checking out. The bad grade is about the movie, not about the edition.."
2,Not very scary,"Yes, this movie is based on the true story of the Wisconsin sicko Ed Gein. Who also inspired Silence of the lambs and Psycho. However the movie didn't really scare me until the last scene. But if you really want to be scared read the book the a to z encyclopedia of serial killers and learn about the worst sicko of all time Albert Fish and other freaks."
2,good idea but poorly made!,"the idea behind this movie was a fabulous one- i mean who wouldn't be scared of a chainsaw welding maniac named leatherface?- but in order for such an idea to work, you have to be able to see the picture on the screen. i mean for me to be scared at a movie, i have to be able to SEE what is happening to the characters! to me, the best part of the movie was the ending... of course that could of had something to do with the fact that the ending was the only part in the movie that you could actually see! though i wasn't impressed with the rest of the movie, i did enjoy the way the potential victim just barely escaped leatherface. it just goes to show that when you could actually see the movie, it was rather enjoyable! i know that it was made on a low budget but come on, couldn't you at least afford a few overhead lights!"
5,review 1.0,"IT was good terrifying, old and at times you can tell its a movie with low special effects but the oldness of it and grittiness of it makes it more horrifying"
3,Dont believe the Hype,"As has previously been said, this film grip's you with suspense, always threatening to shock, but never actually does. The reputation of this film has gone before it. If you're looking for gore and blood then move along, if it's a minor classsic which you're after, that works on the principles of Hitchcock (albiet with less wit, irony and class) then you've come to the right place.To the chap from Dublin, Ireland. I was mightly impressed with your review. Seriously man, that was some good stuff you put in there."
3,It's no Scream. . .,"At the begining of this movie, the narrator reveals that everyone is going to get killed. This makes the story less suspenseful. Maybe the idea was to create a sort of Greek tragedy where we feel bad because we already know that everyone is doomed. Unfortunately, these characters aren't all that interesting. This isn't the sort of slasher movie where you get upset because you see nice kids getting slaughtered. Nor,for that matter, is it the sort where you can't help feeling happy that obnoxious kids are being slaughtered. The protagonists of this movie are neither sweet nor obnoxious. They're just warm bodies. This is particularly true of Sally and her invalid brother Franklin. The movie tells us nothing about their relationship. What saves this movie is the ending where Sally is the last one alive. The narrator doesn't prepare us for the long ordeal that she will go through and it was definitely more bizarre then I expected. This movie is no ""Scream"" but it's worth a look."
5,classic,"This movie is the greatest horror movie of all time. Im glad they put it on blu-ray, it looks wonderful in HD!"
5,One of the best Blu-rays a horror fan can own.,"It is still TCM. It still has the grainy docu-drama feel. But, the colors seem brighter. The detail is clearer (even the graininess). And, the sound Is enhanced. I actually notice sounds which have eluded me so it adds to the atmosphere on a whole. I was skeptical at first. It uses the orginal 16mm ECO camera originals. This blueray also cannot be found in any stores. I have never seen it used or new."
5,Classic horror with a tinge of humour,"This is one of the best and most infamous horror films of all time, and the film gets the DVD transfer it deserves. The picture is good, saying the film is over twenty-five years old, and the sound is excellant. But it's the commentary that stands out; very informative and amusing at times, as the three guys describe how tough it was to make the film in the Texas heat of over 100 degrees. The extras are great too. An abundance of photos, posters, deleted scenes and bloopers, and a superb five minute segment featuring close up shots of the props in the rooms in the house, accompanied by the menacing music. And to cap it all the menus are animated with chainsaws. Excellent stuff for all horror fans. A classic film and disc."
4,The BEST transfer I've seen and it IS anamorphic!,"In response to my hastily posted review, I checked my DVD player and I had selected ""pan and scan"" last week to help fit a non-anamorphic DVD onto my 16x9 TV. Yes, TCM Ultimate Edition IS anamorphic! I think this should close the book on TCM editions. That is, unless they try to release the movie on HD DVD or Blu-Ray."
3,Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"A.this movie is false,B.Leatherface is based on Ed Gein a wisconsin feller,C.Tobe Hooper got the idea for a chainsaw while waiting in line somewhere.If they had just been clear on that in the first place,people would not think this crap happened and it's also why I can't give this Good movie full stars.To prove my point go to aol search and read Ed Gein's biography"
3,Mediocre reissue of a classic,"The movie itself belongs in every horror-movie fan's collection. However, I must add my voice to the chorus of fans here who are bemoaning the rather poor transfer. I have the old full-frame MPI laserdisc and wanted a new, letterboxed edition of this film. Unfortunately, after viewing this DVD I must say I prefer the laser: some scenes inside the house (including Leatherface's first appearance) are so dark that it's impossible to see the actor's faces. On the good side, there is interesting commentary from director Hooper, Leatherface actor Hansen and director-of-photography Pearl, but it's not enough to justify a disappointing DVD."
3,the better b movie,the texas chainsaw massacre is probebly the best cultmovie i have ever seen .i grow up with this film and i can not believe that the new version is better than the original movie..i dont say that the 2003 version is a bad movie but with all the money spend on this one it would be cruel if it wassent a better production..now its just another hollywoodmovie..just like freddy vs jason...to much is to much
1,The scariest film ever? No way,"TCM (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is in a word, awful. There is virtually NO plot whatsoever. The whole film centers on about 5 teenagers who, due to their immense stupidity, fall victim to the demented Texas Chainsaw Man. It's a lousy movie, with lousier acting. Some call this the scariest film ever made? Ha! You could sleep through this nonsense! Do yourself - the valued customer - a favor and give TCM a skip ..."
1,Terrible Shipping and Awful Customer Service,"I requested for two day shipping and was then informed that I would not receive this product until after the new year, being almost two and a half weeks later. ( December 20th - January 5th - 7th ) After checking back with the website in January I was then informed that I would not receive the product until possibly January 19th. That's a full month without having this dvd after purchasing it. This is inconsistent and childish, I would expect service such as this from a twelve year old who's trying to make his first sale on a cheap product that doesn't work. I will never buy from here again, especially around the holidays because doing so is apparently a waste of time and money. Thank you for this awful experience and I hope your business depletes so intensely you're then FORCED to administer good service."
1,uneven,when i first watched this i thought it was pretty good but after a third viewing it stinks. end of story.
1,"The second most overrated horror film next to ""The Shining"".","This 1974 low-budget horror ""classic"" is yet another overrated horror film. It may have started the slasher genre, but it's no ""Psycho"" or ""Halloween"". Those are the only two slasher films that are actually classics. ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is just stupid ... None of the teenagers in this film are ones that you care about. By the last half of the film, I wanted Sally [Marilyn Burns] to be sawed because all she did was scream for a whole hour. The cannibals were more sickening and laugh-inducing than scary. For a better serial-killer film, go for ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Psycho"" of course. Those films are subtle and truly, deeply scary. ""TCM"" is over-the-top, grainy, crude, and masochistic."
1,HORROR CULT CLASSIC? WHY?,"I always hear people say what a great movie this was...a classic...so controversial...so horrifying....THIS IS ONE OF THE DUMBEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. Too bad Amazon didnt have 0 stars as an option. After hearing all the hype, I finally decided to rent this movie, expecting to be frightend to death. Sure the movie had a few OK parts, but I found the movie to be slow and boring. It was like...Kids in a van...Kids find abandoned house....Kids die...THE END. As for the ending...what was so good about it? Guy swinging a chainsaw around and screaming like an idiot? (sorry if I ruined it for anyone). Thank god the store I rented it from had a ""not satisfied? get another movie for free"" policy! If you want to see a GREAT horror movie, buy DEAD ALIVE!"
1,"The second most overrated horror film next to ""The Shining"".","""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" is yet another overrated horror movie. The reason for that is that you don't care about the teenagers who are in it. Especially Sally and her wheelchair-bound brother Franklin. They are so annoying and stupid. As is this movie. If you want a truly great low-budget horror classic, see ""Halloween"" or ""Near Dark"" instead."
1,BAD!!!,This is by far the worst texas chainsaw massacre movie ever. The all of the older ones are. If you want a good one get the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Jessica Biel (4 1/2 star). It has the thrill and sort of a love story to go along with it.
1,0 Stars,"I think this movie is disgusting and immoral, I've never seen it and I plan not to because of what it's about. And I'd like to know, why people always complain all the time about the Passion Of The Christ. Why don't people complain about movies like these? when there are blood-curdling chainsaw murders, and when A godly movie comes out thats more graphic than usual, why do people everywhere complain about how horrible it is, when there are plenty of other horrible disgusting movies? it really annoys Me.Oh, and by the way, don't get this 0 star movie."
5,Remarkable Restoration,"When I first heard about this Dark Sky release, and its 'new restoration', I just assumed it was the regular restored version which has been out for some time, and wasnt to keen on buying it. After upgrading to a 32"" LCD, a lot of the older films on DVD dont look to great, and I eventually ordered this release.Im glad I did, compared to my other two releases of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it makes them look like an old heavily-rented VHS. Sure, its no 'Departed' picture quality, but for its age, budget and style, it looks so good that I cant imagine it getting any better. If you've had doubts about ording this, dont wait any longer, get it today and you wont regret it."
5,Texas Chainsaw Massacre deserves 5 stars!,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is AWESOME on DVD and is packed with cool extras like deleted scenes,sequel trailers and more.Deserves to be one of the 10 best horror movies of all time!If you liked all the crappy movies like Scream,I know what you did last summer,and Urban Legend you will not like it's old movie look,but all serious horror movie fans like fans know The Texas Chainsaw Massacre DESERVES IT'S 5 STARS!"
3,Little Kids Shut up,"I love that when i read the bad reviews and click on the person to see what else they reviewed and i see that they give movies like freddy vrs. jason and water world and hairy potter 4 or 5 Stars. Its funny. It just reinforces why I think every one in the world is an idiot. And, yes too, I am an idiot. I cant wait for a fake metor like the one in deep impact to crash into earth. And yes I am drunk. End of Story."
2,not scary at all,"some people are saying this is the best horror movie of all time.im just like ""what? ""this movie was not scary,it was funny! for the whole last half hour all it was,was this bigbreasted girl going ""ahhhhh! god,no! help me! ahhhhhhhh! ""and the guy with the chainsaw going ""argharhgarhgarhgarhgarhg! ""and yelling like a retard.it cracked me up.then at the end it was just about these crazy people beating up that girl for no reason.and that chainsaw was lasting forever.it would have run out of power after going that long!"
1,BLOODY NONSENSE= THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE,I saw THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and I felt it was the most overated film I have ever seen. The plot could be concevied by a sixth-grader or less and the villians made me almost cry with shame on how lame they were. The rest of the cast acts like they went to the amatuer school of acting!!! SO all in all miss this film I wish I had!!!
1,WHY ON EARTH WERE WE ALL EXPOSED TO THIS TRASH!?!,"Anyone who likes this film must be completely nuts or have not seen what a true horror movie classic is. This is just a stupid film about idiot teens running around getting killed with terrible acting, bad effects, and a lousy story. Oh, and the title says ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", but only one kill in this whole film is by chainsaw. I have not seen something as falsely advertised like this since Halloween: Resurection. Do not see this deciving and crappy nonsense.P.S. I forgot to mention that the sequels and remake were even crappier than this train wreck. One last thing, if you want to see Tobe Hooper at his best, see Salem's Lot (the original 1979 version) and Poltergiest."
1,Chainsaw POP Phenomena!,"I truly think this movie is way overated. The gore was weak the movie was just plain dramatic. If you want true gore watch bad taste, pieces that is gore.I was truly unimpressed by this boring movie it is far beyond scary or good. Good would be an understament."
2,I hated this movie!,"Many people have always told me that I sould see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Everyone always said it was a horrifying film. A few days ago, I saw on the TV guide that the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was going to be on at midnight on channel IFC, so it wasn't cut out. I was excited that I was going to see it,thinking I was going to be scared out of my wits. I stayed up from midnight till two in the morning to watch this and I was so agrivated. I absolutely hated it! It didn't scare me at all. Many people enjoy this movie, but in my opinion, you should never buy it! If you really want to see it, you should rent it first and if you like it, then buy it."
2,Unscarey movie,"I saw this movie and yawned a couple of times during the movie. Maybe this movie was scarey in it's time, but it isn't in this day and age of computer graphics. I found this movie very boring. Get the remake and you will enjoy it much better."
5,Watch a movie with the time it was made in mind,"Of course the plot was silly, of course the characters now seem wooden, and of course the violence is now minimal. It seems this way because several hundred movies have done and redone the ideas presented in this film. This was a true ground breaking movie. Just about every violence based movie can thank this film for at least some portion of its existence. ""Texas"" and the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" (and of course Hammer) pushed the envelope of film. Making it possible for the modern horror film, as we know it today. So before you bash it to much you must first thank it. Without this film you could not enjoy the hack and slash stuff you now enjoy."
4,It's a good movie,This is a review of the 2013 Texas chainsaw 3d..I thought it was good I liked the fact it took up where the original left off...the acting was good..I do wish bill Mosley would have been in it longer..it has some good scare moments and kill moments I will take this anyway over the crappy remakes and even next generation..finally a new chapter not a remake
5,Scared to death!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Words can't describe how much this movie scared me. Suffice it to say, Id rather watch Psycho and then take a shower in the dark. It's been a little over ten years since I last saw this movie, and I remember every damn scene as if it were permenately dug into my memory. Not even a labotomy could erase those images. I've seen quite a few scary movies, and even counting the ones in this past decade like the SAW movies, nothing has or will ever top this movie as the scaries most horrific of all time. I don't reccomend watching this movie, even in the daylight. This movie will forever change you."
5,Worth A Watch!,"Very interesting story about kids being attacked by cannibals. Like others say, this wasn't scary, but I do admit it made me jump a couple of times and grossed me out, especially watching wrinkled old grandpa sucking the blood out of the girl's finger. Acting was well done, you actually believe what is going on and pray that the girl makes it out of the house alive. The ending was quick, because it was all luck of why she escaped. Good movie, I agree, this isn't ""scary"", but it still is really terrific!"
3,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"This is the original, quite different from the 2004 version. I've seen them all except,Leatherface - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. I guess I need to see this one also. In reallity I am dissapointed. There was never a chainsaw massacre! Ed Gien, never used a chainsaw and the 2nd movie depicts his charactor according the the way he really dressed and looked, except his face was not disfigured. I was dissapointed with the remake 2004 version, cause with the original at least there was a sense of truth to it. The whole thing just turns out to be a big Hollywood lie, all the commotion and fan fair just doesnt do anything for me since I found out the truth. Now if this had been true, I'd be excited about the story's not because I like the macabre type things but because somebody told the truth!"
4,A great horror Movie,"I thought this was a great movie. If you are into horror movies, this one is a must. The movie does a good job at letting you feel what is going on in everyones mind. I cannot think of anything really negative about this movie, and would definitely suggest it for anyone who loves horror movies."
2,HA HA HA HA HA!,I saw this movie when I was 12 its not scary nor that bloody or gory. If you want gore see the second one it is WAY more gory. But this one did have its moments that would give you a jolt. I heard it was based on a true story. But that is bull .... I liked it when frankin and the girl were bookin it down the wood to only have frankin cut in half. You can't see it well but it scared the hell out of me.
2,No Way Near The Best,"This movie for its time was a very scary movie. I know the whole true story thing made it good ,but the movie itself was a huge dissapointment i rented them all when i heard they were remakeing the first one. i enjoyed that one. from one horror fan to another this movie is a waste of time"
1,Waaay over-hyped,"I rented this movie hoping to be scared. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. It didn't scare me at all.I don't know how to describe it, but the actors just didn't seem to make the movie scary. It was hard to follow; I wasn't sure if the corpse at the dinner table was the body of the screaming girl's grandpa or if it was just a random body the cannibals dug up.This movie didn't live up to all the hype; I strongly suggest you look for a truly scary movie. (i.e., 13 Ghosts, House on Haunted Hill, The 6th Sense, etc.)"
5,Great horror sqeezed into 1 hours,I heard of the movie when I was just a little boy and always wanted to see it. In Sweden they showed the meat hook sequence on TV and the public freaked out. Movie renters got sued and the movie was banned. So of course I had to see it. And I think it's the best horror movie ever made.
5,Classic Horror,"""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Last house on the Left"" showed these new guys how to do it!!! Forget the blood and guts, these two movies don't need it!!! and the low-budget ""EVERYTHING"" only adds to it, people!!!!! both have stood the test of time, as we wouldn't be talkin' about it over thirty years later, Please!!! we'd have moved on to these ahem, new ones?! that have since come and gone, where are they?! Everything out there today is, in some way, loosely based on these two!!! don't kid yourself. Regardless, these two are here to stay, they aren't goin' anywhere...and i guess, those who just don't ""get it"" WON'T...the mood's all different today...but you guys who grew up in the 70's know what i'm talkin' about."
3,I don't get it,Now maybe it's because I'm only 20 but this movie is not scary the remake is more scary. And on top of it I found it to be annoying either I couldnt see something or the screaming just became ridiculous mostly from the main character. The story is good and so is the idea but the acting and the picture quality were horrible there were at least 3 times were you can barely see wth is going on. Worth a watch but I wouldn't buy it
4,Chainsaw Massacre Again and Again,"CHAINSAW is by far my favorite of these horror franchises... Each new chapter is grand... (Even when they're terrible!!). I just love these characters and this little world solely created to scare the heck out of us. I found another good movie with a very similar feel (very much an hommage to the chainsaw films) calledRoadside Massacre. It too has a great feel and wonderful sense of its own little wrold. Freaked me out honestly. If you love Chainsaw Massacre films and are looking for an undiscovered little gem in the horror genre, then check out ROADSIDE MASSACRE. It's worth the purchase and you'll feel as if you're seeing an all new Chainsaw film too."
4,Invincible Horror Classic,"This is a classic, no questions asked. It's a classic because it stands the test of time in many ways. First, it is a very engaging and entertaining film. It'll never let your eyelids get heavy or let you fall asleep in boredom. Second, it is still one of the most disturbing and scary movies ever made. Since 1974 it has frightened its audiences because of its disturbing nature. It is definately one of the most unsettling movies I've ever seen and one of the scariest. This is a movie that needs to be seen to be believed. I can't just write to you to ""see the movie, it's scary"", you actually have to go and see it right now. Tobe Hooper and co. have created one of the greatest horror films to date, and this DVD does it justice. Over two discs you'll get commentaries, documentaries, trailers, stills, etc. It's a great special edition and I highly recommend it. Note: Avoid the sequels, remakes, and prequels."
5,Cant Get Scairer Than This,"This movie is so well known for its brutaility and horrifying plot - which is indeed based/inspired on the true story of the notourious deranged murderer ED GEIN.A group of teenagers journeying to a house that one of their grandparents had given to them encounter a hitchhiker and pick him up, only to find out the sadistic man is a violent and creepy person. Once they arrive to the house, they are surprised to find out that it is the home of a family of cannibals."
5,"great movie, but it is not true","Great great movie. Truly a pioneer type movie for horror movie fans like me. But sorry guys, this movie is not a true story. It is based on a guy in Wisconsin named Ed Gein who killed 2 women and used their skin for a mask. Still, buy this movie, but only if you have someone to sleep next to the night you see it."
4,The grainy feel...Makes the Film!!!!,"Modern, so-called, re-makes usually stink, I haven't seen the re-invention of this film, yet. I have seen this one though, and it's errie filming, in that 16mm hand-held camera type style, alaBlair Witch Project really added to the effectiveness of the film. This film was also made to allow your imagination to actually frighten you more than they actually showed. This film is ultra creepy, no doubt, and I wouldn't suggest watching it alone late at night. However, in all honesty, it's short on the gore, much like the Shining. In fact, by today's gore standards, it would probably only rate a PG-13. If you like imagining horror more than seeing it, get this film, if not, perhaps you may like the newer version better."
1,sick,this movie is sick and discusting . nothing butkilling. dosent have a good storyline at all. and thats about it.
1,not even remotely close to resembling anything great,"How can you call this movie one of the greatest ever??? That is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard! This movie flat out BITES! It is soooo overrated and boring! It's not even scary! It's pathetic! One of the worst movies ever made! I know I sound bitter but hey, I've seen enough bad movies to know whats bad and whats good, and this movie is BAD. Two thumbs WAY down for this rotten egg."
1,Graphic Violence Meets the Three Stooges,"Should anyone watch This? No. If someone pays you to? How badly do you need the money... The acting is absurd, the dialogue is absurd, the story is absurd. The guy with the chainsaw desperately needs a Curly Fine voice over: ""Woob woob woob, woob-woob...""A true masturpiece (sic). With it's main focus being the hatred of women, this movie will especially appeal to guys who can't get a date. I won't say it's a bad film. I will however say it's atrocious, awful, cheesy, dreadful, inferior, lousy, poor, vile, putrid, rancid, rotten, disastrous, painful, terrible, sick, regretful, disagreeable and unfortunate. If I wanted to give American cinema an enema I'd put the needle right here. When I want to punish my dog I make him watch this. Makes me feel like hell when I do too,Get my drift?"
4,One of the best movies ever made!,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a masterpiece. Surprisingly, this movie is not predictable at all. The ending still blows my mind away. This movie is very believable and is based on the crimes of real life killer Ed Gein.Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't seem to have as much contrast as the VHS edition. The features are great but they would be better if they included some interviews. Anyway, I still recommend buying this DVD."
5,The best Horror Movie Ever,I saw this movie quiet recently. The quality of the DVD was quiet good. I was not expecting something so scary. It scared the living daylights out of me. My roommates were out of town and i watched this movie alone. Yikes...sheer terror!!
2,highly overrated,"The movie should be a classic altough i don't know why. There are some scenes that doesn't make any sense: When the only surviving girl is running away from leatherface she runs straith forwards away from the house and after a while she ends up back there. Also she runs to the gasstation in a recordtime, it took longer to drive the distance with the car in the beginning. And it took for ages untill the first kid died all the others followed in 5 min. The story is kinda cool but i wasn't impressed at all...bummer"
1,Mindless rubbish,Probably the most facile and overrated movie of its genre. Idiotic plot. Tired tension building sequences and juvenile script combine to make this one of the most over-rated films ever produced.
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
2,One of the grossest movies I've ever seen.,"I didn't find this movie scary, but it is gross. Cannibalism has to be the grossest thing going. The only movie I ever got physically sick during was Night of the Living Dead when the zombies are eating brains. I didn't get sick during this one but it is just as gross (probably even grosser). This is a vile, disgusting movie and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has even a little bit of class. Do not by any means spend the [money] or whatever they're asking for the DVD. If you get a chance to see it for free, look at it and judge for yourself. Completely awful and disgusting. Do you like people cutting themselves with razor blades? If you do, you'll probably like this disgusting piece of [film making]!"
4,texas chainsaw,"If anyone asks, I did know that this wasn't really based on a true story. Anyway, I finally saw this orginal last night. I liked it enough. My fav. part was at the end when the girl went all crazy like and jumped out the window while being chased by the family. i laughed. The re-make of this film was really different and i think i liked it more. Latherface was cool looking and the rest of the crazy family were interesting as well."
4,Disturbing,"I thought this movie was going to suck. With almost everyone dying in the first hour, I thought this movie was going to go downhill, but the disturbing part after Sally is captured is the best part ofthe film. Though the movies falls into some traps on horror film, it's still good."
5,fellow fans rejoice,"this is one of the best. i loved this movie. leatherface is the perfect killer. i wouldn't mind seing leatherface vs. otis. leatherface would win definetly. take that house of 1,000 very stupid corpses."
4,Relentlessly Terrifying!,"Okay, from a certain point of view, it is a bad film. Nonetheless, the film is very intriguing and relentlessly terrifying! I was also surprised at how little blood/gore there is (don't let the title or rep fool you). Certainly not for everyone, but a must for horror movie goers.P.S. Don't bother with any of the sequels."
3,one of the few truly disturbing films i've seen,"this movie was disturbing. that is the only word that can be used. i had heard that this was the best film ever, but its reputation is greater than it should. dont get me wrong, it was something to think about, but if your like me and prefer blood and gore (friday the 13th, halloween), than you may find it boring."
4,great monster,"leatherface is one of the best killers in the movie buissness, the ending of this movie is one of the best endings, it leaves you with the breath stuck in the troath, or how ever it's written."
3,well it isnt the BEST transfer,in the inside booklet it says that the new transfer is even MORE terrifying and shocking and ultra high quality...bulls***..this movie is exactly like the vhs transfer except it is a little itty bitty bit more higher...and plus their is one mistake..when the camera pulls back(after they slice her finger)the moon suddenly appears when the camera stops..the moon is NOT supposed to appear until the fading..but thats the only mistake...the menus are awesome..and the alternite footage etc.is really cool..the trailers are a bit shocking at times but u can deal with it. 3 out of 4 stars
3,Sick but still a classic,"If you must watch this gory, deeply disturbing flick, rent this version and not the remake. Just, please, take off the ""True Story"" line someday.....everybody who lives in Austin is sick of tourists asking to be shown ""where the house was!"""
4,Really Scary!,"Next to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE has to be the scariest movie I've seen. And I have seen probably 60 horror flicks or so. I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say buy and be satisfied by something that is actually scary."
5,LOVE IT!!,"ok, i haven't seen this movie in a LONG time, and really liked the 2003 take on the story..BUT, finally bought the original TCSM and fell in love with it..the cinematography, the effects and the female star has got to be the best horror-screamer to ever be in a gore flick!!!From this movie, you can really see how it influenced ROB ZOMBIE to make DEVIL'S REJECTS (Which is my top fav horror/gore flick)...This film is just great to watch for the way it's shot, the story and characters, it's just a great classic 70's horror flick..And it's great cuase it doesn't over-do it with too much gore, just enough to jolt you when you watch it..and the screams are the best...this is a perfect addition to anyones dvd collection who say they are a horror fan. This classic rules!!!"
3,See the Saw,A bunch of stoners happen upon a small town where everyone is a mutant and involved in chainsaw murders. Not much of a story but entertaining and worth watching for all the up close shots of Jessica Biel's booty and rack.
1,Chain saw,Bad movie.Dont spend your money on this one. The acting is real bad. Not written well and produce.Only a few good scary moments in this one.
4,IZO- TCM BBBBBBUUUUUUUUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!,"If you want to see a film that can scare you wihtout using gore this is the one.Tobe Hooper's low-budget horror is brill at the art of suprise with the weird but wonderful music with shocking close ups which believe me make you cringe in disgust.""Leatherface played by Gunner Hanson shows the darkness of the character showing that he is simple minded, almost a child trapped in a mans body.Which makes him an even bigger threat! The strong and realistic story is what really makes this movie a classic.The simple techniques of scare and lack of gore en-force this fact of a ""classic"".The showdown is eye-popping and keeps you glued the screen with in the final moments.(The 4 star is just simply for lack of blood.)P.S. Read my review for TCM 2."
2,"Widescreen yes, anamorphic, No.","This is great if you have a 27 inch 4:3 Cathode Ray TV but if you have a 16:9 HDTV, beware, it will look terrible.Yes, the ""supervised by Tobe Hooper"" picture is great, on a small screen but the DVD is in 4:3 Letterbox not 16:9 Anamorphic so you have to ""zoom"" it to watch on an HDTV and it will look terrible. It's like putting in an old VHS cassette, one that's really deteriorated.I am waiting, anxiously, for a real widescreen version for the modern HDTV audience."
5,a disturbing masterpiece,one of the greatest movies ever fans and critics alike loved this disturbing entertainingmovie is amazing true terror great acting very creepy music letherface and the psycho family are disturbing and disguisting
3,A disturbing movie!!!!,"Plays like a doccumentary with five teens being attacked by a family of backwood cannibals. Altough not very gory, the violence is very realistic, and the chase between Burns, the survivor, and the chainsaw wielding maniac is truly un-nerving."
3,Awesome.,"Though it is great in its horrific images and thoughts, it did take its sweet little time in getting to the point. The ending may not suite everybody. This movie scared me crapless."
5,"Macarbe, Insanity, unbelivable, unforgettable","In all of my 16 years of watching horror, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre stands out as the most darkest, violent peice of work ever. One thinks that its a gore movie, those people dont watch it cause they are truely afraid of this nightmare of a movie. Its sheer terror at its best. END"
3,God Awful Transfer,"Way too dark. My VHS copy of ""Chainsaw"" looks much better. The soundtrack does sound really good though--clean and very sharp. For $16 the special edition is worth buying just for the special features and audio commentary."
3,What did he say?,"When I first saw this film it had just been released to theaters and it scared the bejesus out of me (it seems a little more tame with age). I have since gone deaf from medical complications and have a large video and DVD library. Of coarse these are all closed captioned or subtitled. I was very disappointed when I rented the TCM DVD and found that not only was it NOT captioned but it had NO subtitles in any language. Night of the Living dead is the same way, 2 great cult films that only cater to the healthy sick and twisted people out there. Well, it's time some of us handicapped sick and twisted people were able to enjoy the same depravity!"
4,Absolutely terrifying,"I skipped this one during its drive-in days, but I caught up with it on video in the 80s. I was so primed to be scared that I watched it on a sunny Saturday afternoon with all the lights on. And it STILL scared the bejesus out of me. You'd be surprised by how little gore there actually is and by how willing Hooper is to sustain the length of a scene until you think you'll leap out of your skin with anxiety. The final shot against the rising sun is maybe my pick for the most memorable of any horror film. It seemed to sum up everything that went before plus make you (a) rethink it while you're (b) not sleeping that night."
3,On My List Of Favorite Overlooked Films,"May 2, 2002Okay, admittedly the appeal of this film is limited.What's more, its virtues are very, very hard to uncover.But I can recommend it for one reason: Somehow, someway,whether by design or simply by fluke, via the curiousprocess that is amateur filmmaking, 'The Texas ChainsawMassacre' is the closest a film has ever come toduplicating the experience of REM-ing your way througha nightmare.The rub is you have to sit through it until the end.You have to sit through all of the bad acting, poorproduction, and slow build up--the net effect of whichcan be quite embarrassing. But, if you get to the end,you might see what I'm talking about: that point in thefilm that Tobe Hooper finishes stepping over the lineof good taste and a peculiarly warped but familiar logiccomes into play. Nightmare logic.But you must have that taste for grade-Z filmmaking."
3,you gonna eat that?,"The Texas Chainsaw massacre for those who haven't seen it is about a group of kids who stumble upon a clan of backwoods cannibals.I believe this is Tobe Hooper's first feature as director and he does a great job keeping the suspense and chills going.But the real star of the show is leatherface,boy does that guy have alot of stamina weilding around that heavy chainsaw with his apron on.There's not real gore in the normal sense but there is alot of blood. Don't let the kids see this oneI personally didn't care too much for this film but the acting was great,the film is a little grainy & dark but what the hell that was 1973 so if you like chainsaws this is one too see"
3,Watch Out For The Chainsaw!,"This shows a great detail of how Ed Gein was with a chainsaw effect, though. I really enjoyed this film. It was cool how the family lived at the end, and how it keeps you wondering what the sequel will be like.There are a lot of surprises in this one. If you haven't seen it beforeThis movie is real old, and there are a lot of people, mostly teens who dislike it. But I like it because I can understand old horror movies."
4,R: Grizly in many ways.,"It was extremely grisly as it went into the very disturbing home of the canabals. It was a great scare but lacked quality of sound. The screams were a little bit dramatic.( But hey, I'm not comeplaining.) I loved how everytime you saw leatherface's face. You wanted to crawl out of your skin.ewwww. I would compare Texas Chainsaw Massacre best to either the new release SAW,Halloween, or if you are looking for grizly than check out the newest TCM. Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2004). You will be suprised how much it is like the 1974 eddition.I gave it 4 stars because it was a thriller but I diddn't give it that 5th star because it had way too much gore and grisly violence that was totally disgusting."
4,"No gas for the van, but plenty for the chainsaw!","A well aged horror movie. It's about as sick as you can get. This movie opened the door for future horror movies. Great gore, maybe too much screaming. (oh my head.) And boy can leatherface run with a chainsaw!I still wonder what happens to the other girl???If your a horror fan, see this film. The remake was good because I enjoyed staring at Jessica Biel, but the original is still best."
5,Great Release - This title is Anamorphic Widescreen,"After reading drivein-guy's post, I checked out my version of the Ultimate-Edition TCM release & discovered that it is formatted for anamorphic widescreen (16x9). Maybe check your TV display settings since the title displays properly on my 3 DVD players at home."
1,the most over rated movie ever,"I thought that being a film , which hasn't been released on video / DVD format for so long . And the fact the it was said to be one of the most shocking and brutal to be released on video . What a load of rubbish !!"
1,DUMB DUMB AND DUMB,"this is by far the worse horror movie ever. the acting is pATHETIC, THE KILLER IS A total idiot, the camera footage suckz and theres no story line that goes with it, itz just about a guy that kills people with a chainsaw. i rented this movie and instantly regreted it. PLEAZE do not DO NOT buy this movie and if u do yer screwed"
5,Review by McDougal,"I just don't understand how you can base the pace of a movie made in the early 70s with the pace of horror movies made in recent years. In your review you said, ""I just can't understand it"". I think that about sums it up. No offense...I'm not trying to be mean or rude but I just don't understand how you can compare the way that the scenes play out when, at that time, there were no other movies like it. There are no set standards when making a movie. It's movies like this that go the opposite way that you expect it to go that stand out and become classics."
2,Still NOT anamorphic widescreen,"This new ""special edition"" released Oct.'03 of TCM still is NOT anamorphic widescreen, just like the previous release...in fact the only thing that makes it a ""special edition"" as compared to the previous release is the double sided packaging! The movie itself is great & normally I would've given this 5 stars, but as far as I'm concerned it's a complete waste of money if it's not anamorphic."
3,okay!,"In this movie, i thought i was going to see more of leatherface family but i didn't. This movie was something different after watching the other current texas chainsaw massacre movies."
3,Classic? Maybe. Scary? I think not.,"Now I consider myself a huge horror fan and I appreciate the genre more than most. I did not understand all the hype on this one. I expected bigger chase scenes and heavier gore. The gore in this movie doesn't exist, it's left to your imagination. That would be fine, but there are times the camera quality is so bad I can't even see what's happening to the girl. On the other hand the bad quality of the camera is one of it's strongest points. You feel like someone's making a homevideo and the killer family in this one feels a little too real. They just look like crazies that we've all probably passed on the streets before. As for the chase scences they were perfect. I tensed up through it all and could almost feel how the girl would. Overall this movie is worth a watch and if you're a fan of the genre you'll enjoy this one. Just don't expect anything like today's horror. Maybe that's a good thing..........."
3,The Texas Chainsaw Masscre,"This is the first film about a cannibalistic maniac by horror specialist Tobe Hopper, went pretty much unnoticed in its original release.Thats probably because it sounds like a run of the mill drive in exploitation fair.While it was made on a very low budget it has been hailed as a ground breaking genre work by critics and film buffs."
3,How on earth can you take this film seriously?,"It is beyond belief how anyone can take this film seriously! How can you be scared by some mad man running after some blonde bimbo waving a chainsaw? Maybe it's just me, but I laughed my arse off the whole way through, it has overtones of monty python more than anything else.When you hear the commantry by Tobe Hooper he laughs at it more than anything, and I have to admit I was laughing along with him. This film is just completely unrealistic and therefore seems to be a cynical comedy then a hard boiled horror film.A guy wearing an old ladies face while killing people with a chainsaw? Surely this is comedy at it's best."
2,Latin American fiction goes Harlequin,"If you're looking for literature, forget it. This is barely at summer beachtime reading level. On the other hand, if you like romance novels set in ""mysterious exotic locations"" this may be just for you. Hell, take a look at the cover, it's just a ""latinized"" version of that guy with the long hair who sells butter standing on a windy cliff with a bodice-busting babe and a mansion in the background. How sad that fiction from this area of the world is now coming to this. And Borges wept. (Yeah, I know, re-reading what I wrote it sounds snobbish, but I'm still angry that I spent the money for this tripe)."
4,Feelin' So Good,"Well the wait is over for this single but I can't say that my wait really paid off. The remixes for this are rather dry by regular standards. The Thunderpuss 2000 remix lacks the regular hard edge that they are so famous for and the result is lackluster. Hex Hector's remix is cute...a more disco turn for him. Nothing compared to his remix of Waiting For Tonight, which by the way is finally made available as track #5. I guess that should make the three US fans happy that didn't already plunk down money for an import copy (we must all thank Sony music for keeping abreast of what the fans want huh?) As I digress, it must also be pointed out that the lack of a dub by either of the remixers is blatantly obvious, and that is a shame because the dubs usually give you another mix to listen to when the same one just won't do anymore."
3,WAITING IS FINALLY OVER,"The mixes for Feelin So Good are ok. Nothing really spectacular like Waiting for Tonight. That's not to say they are not good, but they're nothing out of the ordinary. The mix by HQ2 has a really good 70's funky groove to it and is great to listen to while driving along. The best thing about this CD is that it has Hex's Momentous Club Mix for WAITING FOR TONIGHT. This is the mix that I've heard repeatedly at the clubs, couldn't find anywhere and settled for an overpriced bootleg copy several months ago. I've looked on the notes here before and everyone is wanting this mix. If your a Jennifer Lopez fan or looking for the Hex mix then this is definitely a CD worth getting!"
3,not a bad jam,"very decent j lo with fat joe, and big pun not a bad joint but still I've heard better."
1,Feeling sooo ......never mind,"This C.D. stinks like rotten potatoes!Jennifer Lopez may produce some albums well but this is not one of them.The sound isn't very good(You can hardly hear it) and the C.D. doen't really have enough hits on it to cost so much(well,not that much really).Save Your mooch and spend it on something else."
1,Mt Great-Great Uncle,"I only bought this because my Great-great uncle, Ross Santee, was featured in it for about 15 seconds. The video was made in 1939, when color had just come out, and the quality of the color is awful. Shadows in people's faces are green. The story line is so basic any kid could predict the ending. Still, it was well worth $10 for me to have a tiny bit of memorabilia of my long-distant family member."
3,"Before the Streets of Boston, before the Streets of 1860s N.Y.C. There was the ""Mean Streets"" of Little Italy","The first crime classic from the legendary Martin Scorcesse & his first of 8 pictures with Robert De Niro is 1973's ""Mean Streets"". Also starring Harvey Keitel who starred Scorcesse Masterpieces ""Taxi Driver"" & ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" A good, but not great crime drama, an intense classic, one of the meanest movies ever made. If you're are Scorsese fan see ""Mean Streets"""
3,mean streets,"Movie o.k. in so far as quality just did not care for the movie.Cannot remember much about that move, except it was a ""noir"" typeand too dark for me to enjoy. I get the idea that when a move ismade ""in the dark"" it is a cheap movie."
3,Good but could be better,"i've seen the movie and had to watch it the second time to see what was really going on. the cars, the clothing and the locations could have been a little better. the ending too. i mean, he's a good director. but this movie would be something to watch if you had nothing else to do. oh! robert deniro played the best in the movie. without him this movie would have been shit."
3,Mean Streets,"I don't really understand what was the purpose of the movie,If you were raised in Little Italy that's all fine and dandy but don't make a movie that seems cobbled together with a great cast.It's good Keitel's Character is torn between ""doing the Right Thing"" being Catholic and trying to work his way up the Mob Ranks(I'd go the Former) and at the same time help out his deadbeat Friend's gambling debts,but making a whole movie around it seemed to have failed this time."
2,An Ok Movie - But Not Martin Scorsese's Best- BY FAR!,"Let me start off by saying I'm without a doubt the BIGGEST fan of Robert De Niro & Martin Scorsese! Without a doubt this film has a superb cast and a superb director, but lacks a storyline.Mean Streets is a story about a group of gangsters in NYC, who for the most part, dont even cause any crimes. The ending is so horrible, it dropped my rating *1/2 stars.Robert De Niro & Harvey Keitel give oscar worthy performances. GO FIGURE! A bad movie - but they really do make the movie. Keitel's best performance EVER!..."
3,What?,"First of, I'm a HUGE fan of Martin Scorcese's ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"", those movie never get old. I realized this was his first film but come on. The plot is basically about Harvey Kietel growing up in New York City, dealing everyday with problems: the local mob, his epileptic girlfriend, his idiot best friend, the cops, etc. A one-star is too low, and I would've given this movie two stars but I liked seeing Robert DeNiro playing a more comic roll, as opposed to other major movie roles he's had (Casino, Goodfellas, etc). In this film, he plays a punkass city kid named Johnny Boy with a loud mouth and no respect. So that was entertaining. Otherwise, a weak movie. I'm a huge fan of mafia/crime movies but it didn't do it for me. Sorry."
2,"Despite great acting by De Niro, this movie sucks.","Let me start by saying that I had high hopes for this film. Some people praise it like it's as good as Taxi Driver. After watching it though, I have no clue what people see in this movie. It drags on and on and at some points of the film (espcially the middle) you really have no idea what is going on anymore. I almost felt like shutting it off a few times, but luckily De Niro's acting kept me from hitting the stop button.I'm sure when this movie came out it was shocking and disturbing, since there wasn't much like it back then. However, by today's standards it really falls flat on it's face. I would not recommend this film to anyone, although if you're really curious about it feel free to give it a try. Obviously there are those who like really bizarre pointless movies like this. Just don't say I didn't warn you!"
3,DAMN ITS NOT AS GOOD AS I ASSUMED,"Taxi Driver is by far the best scorcese/deniro flick around. Cape Fear was ok and mean streets is less achieved. I sure as hell thought this film would be really really good but it left me to believe you cant win em all. I'm not saying the movie sucked, I'm just saying I expected a lot better seeing as how this was the film that started the whole scorcese/deniro revolution. Still, its a good film. see it if you love the director and deniro. Keitel is brilliant in this one."
3,tisk tisk tisk,"i thought this movie would be at least a little interesting, but it was simply boring, the plot had no point, i think they couldve done a better job on this movie. any how thats just my opinion."
3,had to be there?,"interesting because it's early days for the director and actors, but the dialogue was tiring. i love martin's eye for NYC though, always!"
4,Top Notch,"This film is shot well, has a great soundtrack, and is definitely a great early piece by Scorsese. There's no real obvious plot line, but it's still a fun movie."
5,Vintage Scorsese,"This is pretty much the movie that started it all for Scorsese: guys named DeNiro and Keitel, a pop music soundtrack, graphic violence, and the omnipotent Catholic guilt complex. This film is simple, but also beautiful, poignant, and almost surreal. I highly recommend it to fans of Scorsese's later films. It's a true gem that might've gone unnoticed by fans of Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, etc.I must admit that the first time I watched Mean streets, I wasn't particularly fond of it, but the second time, I really saw it for what it is. Just give it a chance."
3,Lost Momentum,"I've never been able watch Mean Streets all the way through. I bought the Blu-ray as an incentive and was able to finish it. The first part of the film is visually compelling, even exhilarating. But, in the end, I think the film is a failed film in the sense that a respectable novel fails. The characters have no particular depth or moral claim on respect. The film is the first well known of Mr.Scorsese's obsession with these street people. The later ones, particularly Goodfellas are more successful as narrative."
4,NOT THE GREATEST FILM.,"It's worth having to see a young deniro and Keitell. This was the beginning for Deniro-Scorcese team. They would do bigger and better things in later years. This film was probably cheaply budgeted. It jumps during scenes and can be hard to follow at times. Scorcese betters his directing by the time taxi driver is released. This film does influence other films to be later released. (sopranos, Good fellas)."
2,I obviously missed the point...,"I found this film to be anticlimatic, and not that interesting. (I thought the ending was a real letdown, in contrast to those who thought it was so terrific). After reading positive reviews I was really looking forward to a great tale, but didnt see much of a plot. It seems to me that if it wasnt for the big names in this film, it would be a forgotten one. If you like DeNiro, and dont mind older films, Deer Hunter is a much better film and much more thought provoking. That film has a point (perhaps Mean Streets had one but if it did it was too boring for me to notice), and is worth multiple viewings. I probably wouldnt waste my time watching Mean Streets again."
1,Mean Streets,"After (re-seeing) Taxi Driver recently, I was eager to see Mean Streets on satellite.After 25 minutes, I couldn't stand it anymore, and deleted it.This movie is drivel, about a group of worthless losers who somehow think that their pathetic lives are important to anyone but themselves.Yes, there are some stylistic similarities to Taxi Driver (along with some of the same actors, of course), but the result is dramatically different.I am guessing that a good bit of the dialogue in this movie was improvised, but in order for that to be a success, it would need to have some reasonable framework to hang on.This movie is tedious, a total waste of time.It may be that ""students of film"" find this movie worthy of study, but it's a clunker."
5,Fantastice film!,"Fantastic film. De Niro and Scorsese's first film together is gritty, real, brutal, and oh so good. Plus the oviearrived right on time."
4,Great movie about life on the street,"This movie is great mainly because of the acting of Robert Deniro. He is explosive in his role as Johnny Boy a degenerate who owes bookies and shylocks. His friend Charlie, played by Harvey Keitel tries to save him. Movie shows little Italy in the seventies and has an authentic NY feel."
4,"""Right where you breathe""","This is as real and as gritty as movies get. You've got to appreciate the feel of the film, especially if you're from New York or a similar area, where characters like those in the movie are common. You've also got to appreciate the interplay between Keitel and De Niro throughout the film. Some of the supporting acting was a bit shotty, yet I believe this story was told to bring the realism of the streets to the silver screen rather than to impress people with Hollywood glitz.Martin Scorsese draws upon his experiences growing up in Little Italy for the film's material and characters. There is a bonus featurette called ""Back on the Block"" in which Scorsese and friends speak about the inspiration and basis for the movie.This movie began the very successful Scorsese/De Niro pairing that would continue long into the future. De Niro and Keitel are great in their roles - but De Niro stands out in this movie. You will be anticipating his appearances on screen throughout."
2,PHONEY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MOVIE,"Nerd Score Sleazy would like everybody to think he actually grew up tough in NYC----though this allegedly autobiographical junk was written by somebody else AND rips off scenes from lots of other movies.Keitel with his hand over the fire was ripped off from ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" for one thing.And, Deniro is annoying----a lot of Deniro performances in 70s movies are annoying, which is why he only really became known to a mass audience with his later comedies.Deniro getting shot at the end is the best part---cause Deniro and his character are so annoying he deserved getting shot in the movie.This movie was a big influence on Hong Kong action movies, and Hong Kong action movies aren't exactly known for their realism."
1,Terrible,I ordered Mean Streets based on a review I seen on a special on gangster and mafia movies. It is terrible. I do not recommend it to anyone.
1,Hilarious when drunk,"This had to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Just because it had big names, didn't make it good. I do have to say however that when hammered, this film is one of the funniest I have ever seen. I mean, it takes a pair to check your pants at a coat check. I only recommend this film to the heavily innebriated."
1,Horrible film!,"My only reason for seeing this film is because Robert DeNiro is in it. Good 1960's music and good Italian music, but good music doesn't always make a film good. This is a horrible film. Waste of my time."
5,great vendor,My son lost his favorite toy so we had to replace it with this one. I even asked the vendor if he could remove the label and he kindly did it.
4,"Great help, couldn't have written the website without it.",This is the first of the dummies series of books I have used. I read it from cover to cover and practised before I started on my real website. I then used the book as a reference and found it extremely helpful. The website is now published. Some sections were basic formatting that I already knew so I just skimmed over these sections but on the whole a great help.
3,WAY old,"I only bought this to learn the flaws with Front Page. I use Dreamweaver and DRUBBLE. For a refence it is good but for applications, it's a dead horse."
2,Very little useful information!,"The book is too generalized. People who would buy this are web publishers who know SOMETHING about the web and HTML. The book is disappointing in that it really doesn't tell you HOW to do anything! This is a problem. Front Page comes with no instructions, so it must be intuitively figured out. You'll do better just playing with the program. Of course, no web designer in his right mind will condone using this most-terrible program in the first place...maybe it's why MS no longer makes it."
4,An excellent reference work.,"There isn't much life left to Front Page. Microsoft has discontinued the product (which is a shame, but a reality). I still have a couple of old Front Page sites up and they are succumbing to some malady that causes malfunction in the forms. I have to revise and recreate them in Dreamweaver, but I just can't find the time. Therefore, this book was a lifesaver in that it allowed me to find, at least, short-term solutions that allow the sites to stay up a little longer. Not much else is available, so I was lucky to find this book and that it explained, easily and concisely, what I needed to do for those problems that have a solution (and to understand why some problems just can't be fixed)."
3,"Very informative, easy to read","This product was very informative and easy to read. I bought it because we are trying to implement an e-zine type of publication at my firm. With the drop in the economy, any money we can save on training is well worth the effort."
1,not good quality,"The quality of this item was not up to expectations.The Top was scratched, the hinges did not line up to the pre-drilled holes and the staining was inconsistant. If I saw this item in a store I would not have purchased it."
3,Not quite big enough,"I confess that I didn't buy this - it looked too small in the store. I ended up getting the G Pak, and I really like it. It was big enough to hold dozens of games, memory cards, cables and at least 3 controllers. The only problem we had was when we put the Intec monitor on our Gamecube. The case wasn't made deep enough to accomodate it. Our work around was to put the controllers on either side of the Gamecube and the games discs (in small protective cases)in the outer pocket that the G Pak provides. The games were supposed to go in built-in pockets inside the main case. The great thing about it is you just unzip the case, plug in the AC or DC, and play from the case. No problems with overheating and its easy to close up and take into the hotel room."
3,"Tight fit, not for a large collection.","very slim solution. I fit Gamecube, adapter, video cables, GBA cable, controller extension, 4 controllers (1 wavebird), but the games were a problem. I have 5 disc holders that are supposed to clip to the sides. Not enough space to carry them. Needs more places to clip game wallets, will have to modify.Otherwise looks nice. Could do without the velcro inside (I hate velcro)."
5,A Good Case,"I just got this case and I can fit the Gamecube, all of the cords, 2 controllers, and 1 game. There is still room for another game and 2 more controllers. You could fit a Gameboy Player if you detached it and didn't have a lot of other stuff. It is a little bit on the small size but it's still a very good case."
5,Great case,This Is great because I can Fit My game Cube and Acessories.People say you can only fit two games but thats not true. ...Buy this instead of a G pak Which is wasting your money
3,A little on the small side.....,"Looks nice, but a little on the small side, my son chose the G-Pak instead, a little more money, but well worth it! You can fit twice the amount in the G-Pak than the other carrying case. It's also very sturdy. This is the bag everyone needs for their game cube!"
4,Stronger and Better Than Ever,"""The Grandmother of Rock"" scores again with the amalgamation of rock, pop, R & B, and dance. Every song bears the unique Turner stamp of gut-wrenching vocals backed by super arrangements from the band. High marks go out for the dance-friendly ""When the Heartache is Over,"" the seductive ""Falling,"" the rocking ""Without You,"" the emotional ""I Will Be There,"" and the title cut. Not as good as her last release ""Wildest Dreams,"" but still a worthy effort from one of the giants of contemporary music."
1,A Star In Sad Decline,"It's always hard to bow out gracefully when your time is up, and I just wish somebody would have took Tina to one side and told her how bad this album is. Listening to her ailing vocals is hard, stop now Tina, retire and live on past glories because once the voice is gone...."
4,Simply the Best! (Since Private Dancer),"It was nice to hear Tina FINALLY release a CD worhty of high praise. While not as addicting as ""Private Dancer"", I was immediately hooked early into the first track, ""Whatever You Want."" The gospel twinge is a nice touch. Being a person of diverse musical tastes, the diversity this CD offers is the reason I really enjoyed it. The Cher sound on the first single released is not pleasing to this listener, but the positives certainly outweigh this setback. The best tracks are the tile track and the aforementioned ""Whatever You Want."" Tina is far from dead - Rolling Stone be danmed!"
1,what's love got to do with it?,"Partnered with sadistic old Ike in the `70s, she was R&B's most physically provocative interpreter of howling, cat-scratched hedonism. But Teen's mellowed gracefully over the last two decades, so much so that someone must of forgotten to wake her up for this latest entreaty of adult contemporary zzzzzzz. Strictly speaking, 247 is a embarrassing formula album full of the same old hurtin' songs Turner's being turning out since Private Dancer; muted and predictable shrill globbed up with overripened hip hop/soul and wedding dance beats. While she's still effective when she's engrossed in full throttle balladeering, gone is the Tina who was once able to sing any sentiment and make it sound like it was torn from the flapping patchwork of her soul. Today, she's more like Aunt Jemina, drowning her R&B inclinations in a syrup of stiffened emotions and predictable studio belabourment. What's love got to do with it? Not a damn thing."
5,I haven't heard it yet,I just wanted to say that i had the privileged to work with Ms Turner hear in Florida in Fort lauderdale at bachelors 3 night club a very long time ago. It was the biggest moment for me and a once in a life time. She will always be the ONE thrill in my life has a professional player in music. I will always cherish it forever.. Those of you who has seen her live know what iam talking about. ( I might add that she broke Ray charles record there for the most attended.in a night club. The club was located at sunrise blvd and a mile west of the galleria Mall. Hats off to you Tina where ever you are. We all are with you. sincerly Ty and my sister Tina linnett.
5,freddy rules,i loved this movie. heck most horror movie fanatics will. it's better than dumb jason movies.
3,Freddy becomes reality,"Wes Craven and Heather Langenkamp are prepared to make another Freddy movie when a real life Freddy Krueger starts stalking them. A very watchable and kind of enjoyable sequel. Most of the scares come from the original Freddy movie, but that still dosn't let it down."
5,Best of the series,"""New Nightmare"",in my opinion is the best movie out of the entire ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" series.Freddy comes over into OUR world,thus making this film based in ""real life""...and that's what makes ""New Nightmare"" so awesome.It's very unique and different,compared to the other ""Nightmare"" movies.Or any movie for that matter.The actors and actresses use their real names and everything.It's just great.I highly recommend this,if you haven't seen it before.It's scary good!"
3,"Pretty Good, Pretty Good...","Another return to Elm Street, this time almost a behind-the-scenes film. In this movie *SPOILERS* Everybody plays themselves, and they are being tortured by Freddy, who is played by Robert Englund. Robert plays both himself and Freddy in this movie, and Wes is in this film as well.This movie is somewhat more grounded in reality, with a different look for Freddy and a newer, slicker glove that was poised to kill before it was even finished!Everybody in the real world has seen the movies, so who will believe them when they say Freddy Krueger is, for real, after them?It is, to say the last, creative. I enjoyed it, I could get into this film, although it got boring after a while.Cool idea, and the story was put back in the hands of mastermind creator Wes Craven, which is a guarantee that it will be a good film!"
2,Glad I didn't pay money to watch this film,"I borrowed it from the library so watching it didn't cost me any money. The video cover is scarier than the movie.This film dragged...poor plot...and worse acting. Thank God, for the pause button because it would have been difficult to sit though this whole movie without a break. I did enjoy the mother decking the smirk off the nurse's face after the mother protested them giving her son a sedative. It's too bad it wasn't one of those nasty nurses who died instead of the nice babysitter."
1,A real joke to the ANOES series,This was a movie turned into a movie that has to be a real joke to the series. This was a movie where the original stars of the first movie have trouble with Freddy and then Freddy comes to the real world and then kills people. The weird part of this movie was how director Wes Craven made the movie like a documentary of Freddy's life instead of a sequel. The special effects weren't too good nor bad either but you could see why the special effects were mediocre because of the low budget. Freddy would star in his next movie Freddy Vs Jason that was a lot better than this.
1,This is my worst nightmare-------DO NOT WATCH THIS,"Oh man. Picked up this steaming pile of shart in the $5.50 bin. I watched it years ago, and didnt remeber any of it so I watched it again. That was the worst mistake of my life.This is a bastard son of a decent series. Its kinda like Seed Of Chucky in the way that the prevois seriers were movies. The actors of all the old movies realize Freddy is real becuase he lives in the script, or something lousy like that. Not to mention there are only like 3 murders and Freddy looks totally lame, especailly with that retared Robot Glove.If you like the Nightmare movies, and never seen this movie, DO NOT WATCH IT AT ALL COSTS! It humiliates the memories of all the other Nightmares and will make you despise them all."
2,for die hard fans only,"I really love the first Nightmare on Elm street movie. the rest of the series are just absurd and borderline ridiculous. I thought this movie would be better since Wes Craven was directing/writing it.In my opinion it's everything but scary.The concept of this evil entitity trapped in stories for eons is interesting, however not very well explored in my opinion.The scenes remind us of the first Nightmare on Elm Street, a bit cool when it comes to nostalgia but they completely have no surprise effect whatever.It was nice to see some people of the original movie, like John Saxon and Nick Corrie. Yet they have such small roles which undermines their presence in the movie.Corrie doesn't even have a line.The ""scary"" scenes are actually hilarious at some points. This movie could have been better in my opinion..."
2,Fiction and reality blurred,"The movie was not the best effort by Robert Englund or Wes Craven. They did a good job at blurring fiction and reality, but all in all a disappointment. As I watched this movie I thought to myself, why is Wes Craven so famous for? Sure he's made two classic movies- Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream but thats about all. I love Wishmaster, but im sure people dont even remember it. Last House on the Left was bad or at least I thought so. The last three or four movies he's done has been flops. So why is Wes Craven so popular? He really hasnt done much. Come on, I know there is a reviewer out there dying to answer this."
3,"Old Characters, Old Nightmare","hello. i am not really a fan of freddy kreuger, nor do i wish to be, and this is not a NEW nightmare, ..., it was good and all but the character of freddy is just not right, and very stale, to be sure. so, all in all, this wasn't scary and really wasn't that entertaining. if you want a good, long-lasting movie killer who you'll NEVER get tired of seeing, try some of the friday the 13th movies, but if you decide to watch the first two then don't sit through them waiting for a hockey-masked jason, 'cause that's not until the 3rd part."
2,Nothing new,"Wes Craven is writing a new Nightmare movie and his would be star, Heather Langenkamp is having nightmares about her co-star Robert Englund's killer glove coming after her and her family. And, just like in the others, the dreams become reality. Unbeliveably boring and slow. Not for the Nightmare fans for sure. The actors and staff do a good job playing themselves."
2,Rather boring.,"This film tries to be scary and I feel it failed miserably at this attempt. Some o.k. scenes, but that does not justify purchasing this video. Go ahead and rent it, but save that cash in your pocket on better horror movies."
2,very very dissapointed!!!!!!!,"When i saw this movie i thought it would be better then all the rest of the nightmare movies with the exception of the first one(which is the best) Well, this move sucked alot! There was a few good parts but not enough, but most of the scary parts were taken from other movies and from all the other nightmare on elm street movies. I was very dissapointed Wes Craven can do 10 times better then this."
3,A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION! FREDDY'S BACK!,"I am reviewing the entire Nightmare on Elm Street series, but not this DVD release. I own the box set and I wanted to do individual reviews for each film.A breath of fresh air for the sagging series, this one is pretty good. I prefer the original over all the rest by far, but this is one of the best sequels in the series. The DVD transfer looks good and there are some interesting extras."
5,SCARY,SCARY SEQUEL I LOVE THIS ONE ITS GOT SO MUCH DEEP CHARACTER EMOTION AND GETTING INTO THE LIVES OF THE ACTORS A WONDERFUL SEQUEL A MUST SEE RTED R FOR STRONG TERRER HORROR VIOLINCE/GORE ANDLANGUAGE YES THIS ONE DOESNT HAVE NUDITY
4,Not A Sequel- A Stand Alone Movie,"Wes Craven said in an interveiw that this movie isn't a sequel to ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" but instead a movie seperate from that franchise almost entirely- except for the character of Freddy. He is correct because the Elm Street series were fictitious movies in this movie. Heather played Heather and Wes played Wes, who by the way was writing another Elm Street movie in this one. So it isn't a sequel. Its an original. A movie where a fictitional character comes to life. Some people might be upset because this movie is saying that everything in the Elm Street series is fictional but why? This is entirely seperate from the series and this should be taken into consideration. A very creative effort."
2,MOST ANNOYING NIGHTMARE FILM!!!!,"Let me start by saying yes i'm a kid, because i'm 13, and I am a big fan of the nightmare series, but this final addition is ridiculously long, confusing, and annoying. It's long, because it's 112 minutes, it's confusing, because it barely makes any sense, it's annoying, because you predict every scene, and Heather's son dylan screams for no reason all the time, and you hardly ever see Freddy. There are only 4 kills in this one, the first three all happen in the first half hour of the movie, making the movie slow. The kills are for the most part terrible, the only good one was where Chase was gashed in the chest by Freddy's claw which came out of the car seat. So overall, this ranks #6 in the Nightmare series for me. Those of you who dont like this movie and feel lonely for it, don't, i barely watch this one. So don't buy this movie, unless you just want to complete your freddy collection."
2,doesn't freddy ever die?,"O.K., now this is just getting rediculous, in this one all the actors in the nightmare on elm st series play themselves, and freddy becomes real. I mean cmon just let freddy die already."
2,this is not a good movie,"If your a die hard fan and saw them all, you may like it, otherwise be warned. It's not good, the twisting of reality with Robert Englund appearing as himself, and Wes Craven's cameo just didn't add the renewal of life that they had hoped. It's not really scary either, which I thought was kind of a requirement in these horror movies."
1,why wes? WHY!,if you are a big fan of the nightmare series FORGET THIS ONE! its because of wes that there wont be a new nightmare on elm street sequel! the plot for this is is that the freddy charicter was reincarnaited into real life and he's stalking robert englund and heather langankamp (the stars from the 1st nightmare) they should of at least left it at 6 or they could of had alices son be stalked by freddy. but noooo! wes wanted to screw up the nightmare series! if you want the entire colection do not add this to it.
1,Hated it!!!,"I'm sorry, but I did not like this film. I'm glad I did not pay to see this in theaters. I saw it on TV (cable), and was not pleased with the film at all. Bad acting, and a waste of film. The movie was not scary, and it was predictable. Truth is just watch the first 4 Freddy movies. Those are the BEST ones in the series."
1,In Fact the Worst Nightmare Movie,"This movie was absolutely terrible! The only good thing about it is Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund starred in it. Also what's the deal with the krappy new Glove that looks like veins and other organic things are attached, huh LOL! I feel sorry for the Nightmare fans because this terrible sequal was made. It destroys the Nightmare Name and the Original Idea of Freddy being only a dream killer. Don't buy.THIS MOVIE SUCKS!"
4,A decent idea for an aniversery movie,"Wes Cravin returns to directing the sensational horror franchise which he started, and even making a cameo as himself. Most of the cast of the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" also return staring as themselves. The film is Freddy crosses into reality, as his creator Wes Craven writes a resurrection screenplay, to stalk Heather Langenkamp (Nancy in the original and third Nightmare) and her son since she was the original survivor. This one is suspensful and very scary. Unlike the other films since the original, you may never want to sleep again."
3,Slick & Scary But Lacked Some Humor,"This was an interesting concept with real-life actors from the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" horror series playing themselves (Robert England, Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, etc.) but then caught up in another ""Freddy"" story.It wound up being a commentary on the question: ""Does watching horror movies affect people?""Being this movie was made about a decade after most of the other ""Nightmares,"" this film had a slicker took to it, the picture and sound being sharper. It's scary, too, but not as much fun to watch as the others. It didn't have Freddy's sense of humor, mainly, and that was missed. This story took itself too seriously. I have to admit, thought: it kept my attention the whole way!"
3,Life imating art,Director Wes Craven and his cast star as themselfs in this wicked spin on the horror genre.Key players from eariier NOES installments are terrorized by Freddy Krueger and his razor fingered glove as he crosses over into their offscreen lives.It's a life imitating art twist thats ghoulishly fun.Rated R for language violence and gore.
4,An interesting twist on the Nightmare series,"On the set of the newest Nightmare On Elm Street movie, A claw comes to life and kills several special effects crew members. Later, Heather Lagenkamp [Playing herself] begins to have nightmares about Freddy [Robert Englund, Who in addition to Freddy also plays himself as well in this movie] in real life. To make matters worse, Heather's son, Dylan, Is also being haunted by Freddy as he goes on a rampage murdering the past and present cast members of Nightmare movies. This is just what the Nightmare series needed to do: Reinvent itself. This is not a sequel to any of the previous 6 movies, But rather, An effective spin-off. There's plenty of gore, A very clever story, Good acting, And great special effects to keep slasher fans happy throughout the course of this movie. Worth a watch if you wanna see a new take on the character of Freddy Krueger. Followed years later by another spin-off, Freddy Vs. Jason."
2,"good idea, bad script","Wes Craven decided to make a Nightmare on Elm Street movie by mixing reality with fantasy. This was a good idea but the movie itself just wasn't good. The fist half of New Nightmare is slow and drawn out while the second half barely picks up and leaves a mediocre ending. If you are curious to see this film then go ahead and rent it. Still, I think the chances of New Nightmare being dissapointing are very high."
2,Again it never ends.,They've come up with titles again and again with the final nightmare or the final chapter or the final friday. It never ends. Our grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren will be watching the 45th nightmare on elm street along with halloween and friday the 13th it will never end. They tried to mask how many they made by taking away the numbers and just putting in a name. Nice try it didn't work. I love horror movies and Freddy's my hero but making the other 6 just movies and making this 1 real life is dumb. Next it'll be Wes Craven's 2nd New Nightmare. Getting Nancy a son was a good idea considering the plot was gettin old but Freddy Kruger a TV character. Come On. If something's fine why change it. The nightmare on elm street's are great so why tamper with it. Still though next time they make one the movie better not be a movie
1,This movie doesn't follow the other movies,"I watched this movie on cable last night; and it was horrible. It was the worst Nightmare on Elm Stret Movies ever. It doesn't follow the story line at all from the past movies. It took forever, for anything scary to happen. Also, the movie wasn't as gory or bloody like previous movies. Not worth buying at all."
2,"""Hello Heather, miss me?""","Wes Craven's New Nightmare, is played out in real life with the actors who played the characters in the Nightmare in Elm Street series. It starts with Heather (Nancy in ""N.I.E.S"" series), her husband and 6 year old son reciving threatning phone calls that contain the Freddy Gruger rymes. Heather's son Stats to have Freddy nightmare's but of course no one will believe him until Heather has the same nightmare's . It appears that Freddy has jumped off the screen and into real life and the only way to stop him is to fall asleep.This movie lacked classic horror and reaked of petty scares and not any real gore but did had it's moments. Though Freddy did look a lot more scarier with updated facial apperance and a long black jacket he was to comedic. The grafics were not great as it was just played out in real life except for the battle with Freddy."
3,SCARES YOU EVERY TIME,THIS IS ONE OF THOSE HORROR MOVIES THAT SCARES YOU EVERY TIME YOUSEE. EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW ITS COMING.I LOVE THIS IT IS THE ONE MOVIES IN THE NIGTMARE SERIRES THAT I THINK IS GOOD. EXEPT FOR THE FRIST ONE OF COURSE. ALSO MIKO HUGHES IS IN IT THATS ALWAYS A PLUS.
3,FREDDY'S BACK!,"This movie is about the actress that starred in the first and third movies and is out to defeat Freddy. Remember, DON'T FALL ASLEEP!"
2,Here we go again. So much for 'Freddy's Dead',"What could have been an interesting insight into the effects of films and the Freddy myth in general is no more than an excuse to drag out a now tired character yet again. There are good moments, but also a lot of padding, and you can't help but feel all the way through this film that Freddy should have been laid to rest a long time ago."
5,Great deal,I was apprehensive about buying the songwriter but I am glad i did. I have transfered many tapes and records onto CD and am totally impressed at the sound. Extremely easy to use. Nothing to set up. You will be recording in 10 minutes after you get it out of the box.
3,"Enjoyed the book.. However,","One look at the cover of the book and I bought it. I guess I'm not the only one who bought the book because I wanted to know ""that side of the story"" and about the people who suffered the most. I read the book and I must say that I expected more than what I got. The book is nice and will touch your heart. But as the story goes on, you start to loose interest. It becomes a sequence of events, nothing more. I agree that ""sometimes you must decide to survive"". But I think that, well, the second half of the book could have been written in a more interesting way.It is an affecting read. But if you read it, don't take too long or stop reading and think ""I'll come back to it later"". Finish the book and you'll enjoy. Put it aside and you won't!"
4,close,"I have been to Africa...and outside of actually being there, this is the next best thing. I leave one star out-only out of malice for NOT actually being there. It's kind of like going to the zoo-after being in Africa. Nothing realted is the same-on video...or encased in zoo cages. But it is a awesom trip none the less...and I highly recommend this flick!"
4,Commercials,"For the positive comments read the other reviews. I just want to warn other buyers of this set that the disc is encoded so that one is forced to watch the sponsor messages (ie, commercials) at the beginning of each disc (skip and fast-forward are disabled). Also, the excessively long introduction for each episode is at the beginning of the first track so that one cannot skip past it. Perhaps there are DVD players that ignore the encoding, but mine's not one of them. For a PBS/NatGeo production to do this on a ...set is more than a little annoying. Even commercial producers haven't gotten that obnoxious yet."
4,Players Got To Play,"I love pick-up lines and this book delivers. ""The Definitive Book of Pick-Up Lines"" by Max Tucker delivers lines that have more punch and wit, however these pick-up lines have more conversational quality to them. Devon Wild is a P.I.M.P."
4,An interesting CD,"This CD is really good to get into swing music and if you like ska, a lot of these songs will appeal to you. ""Ding Dong Daddy of the D-car line"" is a great track and a lot of these songs can make you feel like you're in the movie Swingers. I definitly think this is a great investment."
4,Band guys swing!,"I first heard the Cherry Poppin' Daddies (CPD) several years ago in a small club as the middle act between the opener Rancid and the headliner ""X"". CPD struck me as a bunch of bandroom guys with great chops and a quirky frontman who have found a way to keep gigging. This was before Zoot Suit Riot. This CD is a great introduction to their pre-Zoot SubPar label releases including a number from that original show."
2,WAY over-rated,"As a huge fan of swing, I was really excited to get this album, but as soon as I got past Zoot Suit Riot, which is an incredible song, I was instantly disappointed. Other than Zoot Suit Riot, the rest of the album just doesn't have the swing and fun of that one song. It's not a bad album, but it certainly isn't good either."
3,"Great CD, but there are better swing bands","A fun CD, with infectious tunes that get your hips swingin' and your feet movin'.The Daddies do some good work on this album, but if you look for a CD with a broad spectrum of swing styles, this ain't it. I probably sound like a record with a deep gouge in it, but if you like these boys, you shall absolutely love the Royal Crown Revue.Regardless, this is the one of the best albums to dance to. The tunes are infectious, and the energy level is breakneck. This ballsy album is recommended, but isn't really a must-buy."
3,the only real good song is zoot suit riot,"This CD is a example of a kind of swing that is different than that of Brian Setzer Orchestra or other traditional swing groups. It is a crossbreed of Ska and swing which, depending on what you're looking for, is good. The only song worth listening to over and over again is ""zoot suit riot."" It has a catchy tune and is fun to listen to."
2,"Or, if you want good swing...","Then check out Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. I picked this up because of Zoot Suit Riot. The vocals are weak and somewhat whiny and the lyrics are lame. The only thing saving this disaster disc from the lowest rating is the music. This band can play! Unfortunately, I just can't get past the vocals and lyrics to listen to it and enjoy the instruments. If you want a cheap copy of this, check the shoulder off of I-405, that's where I've tossed mine. Seriously, for the complete package, do yourself a favor and check out BBVD!"
1,Nothing new here!,"This album is very repetitive, that sums it all up. Every other type of music has changed at least a bit, it has been 60 years since swing came around. Guess what? It sounds exactly the same on this album as it always has. BORING!"
2,One good song,Zoot Suit Riot is great. The rest almost put me to sleep. I liked Setzer's CD a lot more.
5,One word.... AWESOME!,"I first heard of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies last week as their awesome sound and rhythm jumped from my co-workers pc. As a 30 something desk bound professional having played in a big band during my college days, their sound awakened my soul. What an incredible and powerful sound this band possesses. This is American music at it's best! Now if I can only catch my breath and stop my feet from a tappin'!!"
5,What a revival!!!!!,I would tend to call this part of the swing revival--the ability of a band to make full use of past rhythms and spice them up with a little rockabilli and a touch of jazz. Great fun! To those who think the lyrics are too harsh--music should do just that: reflect the potential in real life--good or bad--by putting the best light on it and getting you to dance along with ol' hi dee ho.
3,Zoot Suit Riot,"I admit most the melody on this cd is very catchy and jumpy, but the lyrics get in the way of really enjoying the songs. It's more depressing than not. Most people say if you like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy you'll like this cd. I'm a big fan of BBVD but I wouldn't recommend this one."
4,great Swing music,"This is the only CPD album I own, but it's fantastic! Finding good swing/big band music isn't the easiest thing to do, but CPD is a great place to start if you want to pick up something from that genre."
3,Great album!,"This album is really a lot of fun. The music is upbeat and fast-paced. A very enjoyable album, and one that I'd definitely recommend, but I think that Squirrel Nut Zippers' ""Hot"" is better."
5,High-Energy Fun!,"Take a horn section,add a jazz beat, a vocalist who sounds like he comes out of the 1930's, and some fun (raunchy) lyrics and you've got the Cherry Poppin' Daddies.This disc is a lot of fun throughout. Just try to keep your toes from tapping as you listen!"
2,the music may be swing....,"I was majorly disappointed with the lyrics. Call me fickle if you will but, the sexual overtones in the lyrics were just too blatant. Swing to me has always been a refuge away from this. If I want to hear music about sex and such, I listen to rock, it's expected there. However, the music is first rate with tight rythms and wonderful horns. Peace........"
5,I love this cd because it's fun to dance to!,This cd is soooo fun to dance to at parties. I love the beets!
5,Add it to your collecton,"After hearing and seeing the video for ""Zoot Suit Riot"", I wanted to hear the whole album. I was skeptical at first when I bought it, but I'm glad I did, it kicks! The music is good for listening at parties or just around the house. Add it to your collection, you wont be disappointed."
4,Some Great Tunes for Listenin' & Dancin'!,"This is a terrific collection of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies swing songs, great for swing dancing, listening, playing at a party, whatever. The band is rhythmically tight, colorfully arranged (music-wise), and pleasantly creative and upbeat. However, when it comes to real musicianship - musicians that can improvise a solo with personality - this band comes short. Solos are few and far between. And, if you want a tougher, more masculine lead vocal, look elsewhere (Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Royal Crown Revue). Despite that, this band is high quality compared to most swing bands and is one of the few worth droppin' some dough for."
4,its grate modern swing!!!!,this is a grate cd. my favorite song on the cd is Mr. Bones. if you like swing than this cd is for you. hope you injoy!!!!
5,Music to work to!,"I spend long hours working at a computer at home. I play this CD over and over while working. This album reintroduced me to swing, and I can't get enough of it. The beat, the illiteration (i.e., Ding-Dong Daddy of the D-Car line), the unusual subject matter of the lyrics, etc., all make for a CD that I never tire of listening to."
3,decent chart. OK for swinging,"It's a decent collection. The charts are very technical and challenging and were performed with skill and class. 4 big (BIG) problems: 1) The sax section seemed unsure of itself, making the charts not-all-too enjoyable to listen to. 2) The endings were extremely weak. There was no definate end to tracks 5 and 6. Also, track 6 had a horribly written and performed last 20 (or so) measures. 3) Some of the lyrics were disturbing. 4) The songs lack variety. All the songs are ""In-your-face"" types which, if one danced to the entire CD, would be running a 70+ minute marathon. Also, no instrumental charts, indicating that CPD isn't that proud of its horn sections. While the band is good, it should aim more towards the mix which the Voodoo Daddies played (not quite the same though). On the plus, the vocals and brass are extremely talented and the performance of the songs more than make up for the weak points."
2,Too Much Hype,"I've got to give props to the Cherry Poppin' Daddies for starting the swing revival. But for anyone out there who is just starting into the swing scene this is deffinitely not IT! Yes, there is a lot more to swing than just ""Zoot Suit Riot"" and ""Jump, Jive, An' Wail"" I suggest trying Blues Jumpers and Colin James. Listen to some of this stuff and you will realize that Zoot Suit Riot is nothing but a song for banwagon swingers."
5,Zoot Suit Riot is an excellent swingin' groove album.,"If you live for swing, you'll love The Cherry Poppin' Daddies. They're full of jump, swing, and a style all their own. You'll never get tired of this one. So grab your swingin' cat or kitten, and crank up the Cherry Poppin' Daddies' Zoot Suit Riot!"
3,"Good, Not Great","CPD is a decent band if you take them for what they are: not a real swing band, but more of an insane mix of ska, punk, alternative, jazz, and lastly swing. There are 4 or 5 good songs here, but if you're looking for the most authentic sounding swing of the new era, spend your money on Big Bad Voodoo Daddy."
1,Broke the first law of swing,"I think that it is absurd that the Cherry Poppin Daddies feel the need to swear though out their album. Swing lyrics are supposed to be fun, light hearted, and make fun of the times both today and of yester-year. I wrote them off my swing list until they can clean up their act - it is a shame because they have a real tight horn section."
2,"Ear torture, and a waste of money","The instrumentals and musicianship itself are great, but the lyrics make this hard to listen to. The vocals are either overdone or over the top. If this had been just an instrumental release it would have been great! This simply isn't fun to listen to. You want fun interesting music and good lyrics, check out Brian Setzer and The Big Bad Voodoo Daddies."
2,Not really that good.,"This isn't really that great at all!!I don't know what you people were listening to, but it sucked. I brought it back that day and said it was all messed up and got a different CD. This is a 90's rip off of swing style/big band music."
4,"Cherry Poppin' Daddies "" TEAR IT UP!!!!!!""","Zoot Riot is the lead song and the one with all the air play, but there is an other that is deserving air play. Brown Derby Jump..... the bass guitar in this song is remarkable...... Many of the songs relate to each other, like if it was telling a story. If you like Brian Setzer, you will like this CD. This CD jumps and jives!!!!!"
5,CPD are the BEST. That's all.,"I was the first person around to get this CD, I had to order it through a record store. Cherry Poppin Daddies are currently on playlists for Top 40 stations, as well as MTV and VH1. They are, simply put, the best band with the most talent to be recognized by the music industry in a long time. I had the pleasure of seeing CPD live, and I was high for weeks after. They're just, wow."
3,Swing? Ska?... Swing-ska,"Cherry Poppin' Daddies are one of those swing bands who mix swing with ska and pop. If you like ska you'll maybe enjoy this record. I don't like it very much because of Steve Perry's vocal is sometimes obnoxious and their syntetic sound is irretatable. But some songs are really great (""Zoot Suit Riot"", ""Ding Dong Daddy In A D-Car Line"",...). Listen to the whole album very carefully before you buy it!"
4,ummmmmmm,this is a really good cd......and i listen to punk music. im not really sure why i like it.......it's just good...ya know? unexplainible i guess.......
3,"almost hate it, but I do play it","CPD is a very lyric-challenged band. The tunes are generallygood, but the lyrics are either nasty, obscene, pessimistic,or just plain rude. I love swing music, but I do not play thisCD at home or when my kids are around, and more often than notI just skip it and play something else. It's too bad--the bandis talented, but have chosen to lower themselves into thecesspool."
3,Good but Questionable,"Yeah, this is a good album. I'd like it a WHOLE lot more though if the lyrics weren't so questionable. I'm trying to find a really good swing band [like this one] with good clean lyrics. Big Bad Voodoo Daddy is a good alternative."
5,fast service-good product,Product arrived in a timely fashion and although used was inexcellent shape
1,This was obscene,"I didn't pay attention to the reviews, sigh. I tossed the cd. The music may be good, but the concept is creepy. I glad for my naivete, this isn't the sophistication that I want to embrace."
1,Offensive Content and Language,"I love swing revival music, but my exposure to various groups has been limited. I bought this as a ""buy it together"" with another CD, listened to four songs, and turned it off. I won't listen to it again. The themes of the songs are sex-charged and the language vulgar. I guess I should have known by the title, ""Cherry Poppin' Daddies,"" but I was thinking more along the lines ""poppin' = jivin'"" rather than it having a sexual connotation. Shows how out of the loop I am, I guess. Some people would probably love this CD, but as a Christian, I'm offended by the themes and the language. There was a low-class knock on God, too, and that was the end of the CD for me."
5,Can't stop playin it!,"A couple years ago I discovered the big band and swing sounds from my grandparents generation. Although the music was great, the lyrics were old and kinda silly! I bought this CD after hearing Zoot Suit Riot. Its the 90s with a 40's sound - what a combination. Its just a ton of fun - caution - if its possible to wear out a CD, this may be the one! Enjoy!"
5,Best swing CD there is,Zoot Suit Riot is the best swing CD I've heard and it is one CD that I listen to from beginning to end. If you're looking for a excellent swing CD this is it1
5,They make good music that makes you want to dance.,"The Cherry Poppin Daddies are awesome and they make you want to get up and dance. They also dance good, swing good, and make you want to learn how."
2,"Blues, not swing","The rough vocal style and raunchy lyrics in this album are more typical of blues than swing, and if that's what you like, fine. The musical composition is more upbeat and genre-defying than stereotypical blues riffs, but if you were expecting to hear swing music, you'll be sorely disappointed. Give me Benny Goodman any day."
5,Almost addictive...did I say almost...,Just to good to miss out on. One of the best CD's I've heard and this is after listening to it for a month straight.
1,"Warning, if you equate Swing with fun, don't buy this.","I had high hopes after reading the reviews, but I really regret wasting my money. If I want to hear about fathers beating their children and the kids' painful begging not to be hit with that thing in your hand, Daddy, I will meet with my clients. Word-pictures to let us all in on how it feels to be abused by a parent is not, IMHO, appropriate lyrics for the wonderful fun I have dancing to Swing. Stick with the classics. Don't let depressed people or children near this. I even hesitate taking it to a CD reseller."
4,Interesting,"I got this CD used at Wherehouse. My friend wanted me to get it as a joke, and I did. I listened to it a few times and decided not to listen to it again. A week later I listened to it again, this time deciding that the CD was indeed quite amusing. Although I'll admit that the CD is good, songs like ""No Mercy for Swine"" can be very annoying at times. ""When I Change Your Mind"" has to be one of my favorites, which is a great song to listen to when you see your ""crush"" from a distance. Even though I love that song, the best track on the CD is ""Brown Derby Jump"". If you've got the money and you feel like getting a CD that'll perk you up when you're down, buy this one."
2,Please,"Just not a very good album. Rather than creating new music that lives and breathes (like the Squirrel Nut Zippers), CPD just photocopy a style they like."
5,"The music is uplifting, fun and great to dance to!",The Cherry Poppin Daddies was the first band I have listened to playing swing. The first time I heard them I knew it was fun music. It wasn't until I purchased the CD that I fully appreciated all the different methods swing music could be portraid.
3,Daddies strike again,"This latest release by the Daddies leaves little to be desired musicaly. The rhythem section accented by the slammin' horn section is truely sensational. Very reminisent of the swing band ""Hot & Spicy Jumbo Shrimp."" The lyrics on the other hand truely talk away from the whole musical expirence. While they may be thought provoking and even inspired, they detract from the listening pleasure (Dunnk daddy,Mr. White Keys). Keep up the grove guys, but take a lesson in style from the ""Hot and Spicy Jumbo Shrimp"""
2,Good Musicians but not original or diverse.,"Album had some high musicianship points BUT the songs sound the same, the lyrics are juvinile, and there is just has no originality. They are basically a strong cover band re-doing things that were done 50 years ago only not as good. Likely a great band to see live and dance too but too repetetive and un-original for CD. If you really want to Swing, with lyrics pick up some Louis Jordan from the late 50's. He was a great song writer, lyricist (catchy, entertaining, pure), and alto saxaphonist. Also go for some Duke Ellington or Count Basie."
5,More than Zoot Suit Riot.,"""Zoot Suit Riot"" is the hit but, there are more good songs like ""Mr. White Keys"", ""Dr. Bones"", and ""Drunk Daddy."" If you get this CD you'll love it. I know good music when I here it and I'm only 10."
2,"Wasn't very impressed, especially after all the hype.","I bought this cd after hearing the title song for the hundreth time on the radio, thinking maybe the whole cd would be as good. Boy, was I wrong. I would return it if Amazon would take an opened cd back!"
2,One hit wonders?,"Not really all that good. And, the language used could be better. Not a keeper... Sorry."
5,"Fun, Fast, and Swingin'!!","I've heard some people say that the Zoot Suit Riot album is all about abuse and being miserable. Not all of the songs on here are like that, like ""Brown Derby Jump,"" ""No Mercy for Swine"" and ""Zoot Suit Riot."" It's hot jazzy swing with one hell of a beat. I would definitely suggest you buy this album, and if you don't like ""Drunk Daddy"" or ""Master and Slave,"" just skip them cuz' the rest of the songs are DEFINITELY worth it."
1,good musical quality ruined by foul lyrics,"This album was good for music quality but the lyrics were at times foul. There has been a lack of new musical ideas, everyone is trying to make it on shock value and pushing the envelope of social acceptability. People are tired of being screamed at and assulted by ""music"" and that has helped the resurgance of music such as swing. The Cherry Popin Daddies have taken the revival and put some tasteless lyrics to add the 90's garbage influence. I played this CD one time and took it to the local store and sold it."
2,2 Stars is genorous if you ask me.,This CD i bought because of Zoot Suit Riot. That was the only song i had heard prior to buying the CD. THe other songs I liked were Dr. Bones and Master abd Slave. This CD caught me by supprise with how bad it was. If you are looking for a good CD this ain't it.
5,I saw these guys in concert and they rock!!!!,the CD is great and I saw them in concert it was awsome definetly buy the CD they have a great beat and everyone can enjoy it.
3,Unnecessary Profanity Cheapens Music,"This CD has a some catchy tunes, but there's a reason this hit the mainstream airwaves. I felt that profanity was overused and unnecessary -- adding no artistic value that I could see except to get teenagers interested. I won't be a repeat customer of this band."
1,"Go back to ska - wait, they already are","I've been swinging for about a year now and I've heard Zoot Suit Riot so many times I figured that I should buy the album thinking that the rest of it is really good too. BIG MISTAKE. This is your typical one song album. You see, the CPD used to be a ska band until the swing revival and then they jumped on the bandwagon to cash in. The whole album is just a compilation from their two past albums, really making this album a ska album. The lyrics are horrible, the songs aren't even swing songs, and the album will give you a headache. If you are into ska, by all means, buy this album. However, by swing standards this album is as bad as you can get. If you aren't into ska, do yourself a favor by not buying this album and by getting a real swing album."
4,"It's Good, and Finally, Here's Someone who will Tell you WHY","ok, to begin with, this is a good album. Instrumentally, it's great album, and has some really neat stuff in it. The drummer is exellent, and does an exellent job with every track. However, this is definately not ska. So just put that out of your head. This is more like swing with lyrics... I mean, it's like jazz, but not exactly. It sounds to new, has no solos, etc. but definately has some great stuff in it. Next, To silence the rumor that the only good song on this cd is Zoot Suit Riot, I completely disagree. I actually believe that Zoot Suit Riot is among the worst on this cd. The best track, in my opinion, is Here Comes The Snake. The lyrics themselves are good, and I don;t consider this swearing music. It wasn;t nesecary for them to put them in in the first place, but the swearing is light, not that I care...In conclusion, this is a good album, and I think it's essential for a jazz collection."
1,Well.... then there's this.,"If you're the type that thinks swing dance belongs on the same radio station that plays the top ten Billboard, and/or If you like jazz but don't know who Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman and Count Basie are, get this!If it's so good, why are so many people selling it used???No offense to the band, but there are many, many better albums (and bands) out there that are *so* much better. Granted, some of these songs are catchy, this would be my last pick for this type of music. Closer? Big Bad voodoo daddy and Setzer. Even more? Indigo Swing and Rhythm rockets. Ray Gelato. Lavay Smith. Steve Lucky & Rhumba Bums. Want to really get closer to jazz and / or swing? check those out first. Closer? Look into the real evolution of swing dance. But please don't look here and start on the wrong foot."
2,Just say no,"These guys are a ska band, not a swing band. It shows. You listen to their horn arrangements, and they sound like bad rips offs of the 30s style. Listen to how they try to swing - it sounds mechanical, forced. How on earth can one listen to this and enjoy it? How can one dance to this? It just doesn't work.Maybe their ska is okay, but their swing is sickening"
2,"""Explicit lyrics and subject matter""","The name of the band shoulda warned me, but it really didn't sink in until I started to listen and read the lyrics. I really don't understand why they have to use such foul language and subject matter. It completely takes away from the enjoyment of the music, which isn't bad. And Steve Perry's voice certainly isn't anything to write home about. In fact this album would have been perfect if it was an instrumental. And it is a shame, because the music is pretty good. The only thing that stopped me from giving it one star, was for the fact that Kenny G doesn't play on it. That alone bumps it up to 2 stars."
5,GREAT MUSIC!!!!,I love this album! It makes me want to throw on my zoot suit and swing all night! It took me right back to the 30's!
4,Pretty Darn Good!,"Lot's of fun! I don't agree with the criticisms of the lyrics - they are for adults. If you like this stuff, also check out Joe Jackson's ""Jumpin' Jive"" from almost 20 years ago (as well as the originals, of course)."
1,Awful stuff,I agree with the two previous reviewers. This is indeed horrendous fake swing that doesn't hold a candle to the original masters. It is also GRATE (not great) modern swing!
1,Swinging and Swearing Don't Mix,"These losers have a brain-dead idea. They trot out the old Swing/Jump sound of the '30s, then figure that in order to update it for the '90s, they'd better add some downer lyrics and foul language. This is the modern '90s idea of fun, I guess.No thanks. If I want to listen to Swing, I'll stick with the original masters. Do yourself a favor and buy a Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, or even a Louis Prima CD, and you'll see how lame these neo-Swing pretenders are."
1,There's much better modern swing out there...,"The swingin' sounds on this may rock, but the swingin' words on Zoot Suit Riot are simply awful. Abuse and swing just don't go together... this stuff is supposed to be FUN, not miserable. Go listen to the Squirrel Nut Zippers or Brian Setzer Orchestra instead."
3,"Very fun, but not able 2B appreciated until seen live","The CPD's album is definitely worth buying if you love to swing at parties. The song Dr.Bones is unbelievable fun, it just makes your body smile! But please if you don't want to spend the money on the CD take that money and see these cats live. I'd been swinging locally for three years and gettin made fun of by dudes at school before I saw CPDs at hfstival. Needless to say all them dudes are now swingin and man, are CPDs swingin live! Despite 100 degree temps, my friends and I swung non-stop. My only disappointment is that the name doesn't go over well with my dad and that Glen Echo, which has always been nigh-empty is now severely overcrowded on bi-weekly swing night. Oh well. Bytheway Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's CD blows Zoot ou of the water. Trust me its that good. But CPDs have 2B given credit for breakin the scene open on radio (is that a good thing?). Thanks guys for a good album and a great show."
4,Their songs are fun to listen to and sing along with,"The songs on the album have a swinging tune that sounds like it could be played on the Dick Tracy soundtrack, this adds a sing-along value that has driven the Daddies fame & fortune."
4,Another tenn pop star,"Admittedly, ""Another Dumb Blonde"" isn't half bad. It is catchy but it has a bonus: Hoku doesn't sound as bad as Britney Spears. Thanfully, she doesn't growl like Mandy Moore does sometimes which is rather a blessing. Hey, at least she can sing. And if she has learnt the lesson of Jessica's and Mandy's failes outings, there's no reason why she can't be as successful as Britney or Christina."
5,Hoku,"This CD is worth it. The songs in the movie ""Snow Day"". It is awesome. I know I might sound crazy but this song is awesome."
4,DUMB BLONDE? I dOn'T ThInK sO.,"If you like music, you'll like this. Full of beat and jive, it will make you want to go and get it fast."
4,"a ""teen fluff"" song - but a pretty good one","""Another Dumb Blonde"" is a pretty decent song - to be sure it's teen fluff but there is nothing wrong with that - many of the all time great songs could also be considered ""teen fluff"" - it does fit the standard formula for this material in many ways, but it is less saccarhine than much of Britney's , Christina's, and Mandy's material. Hoku has a pleasant voice, the video is well done, and she is lovely to look at. And since she is Don Ho's daughter, I wonder if there will be a teen version of ""Tiny Bubbles"" on her album."
5,Hoku:Another Dumb Blonde,"When I got this, I was like, WOW.This single got me totally hooked when I listened to it.Trust me, Hoku is a great singer with a special talent that should be recognized for her famous talent.The sound is awesome, & the dance mix is amazing.Take it from me, if you're looking for a new song, then Hoku:Another Dumb Blonde is the one to get!"
2,Another Dumb Blonde,"She sings that he never loved her and she never loved him, so what is her complaint? Both were leading the other on. She dances like a stiff giraffe, and the camera keeps changing angles to hide the fact. Like the others said, she doesn't have the vocal range like the other teeny boppers out there. A single with one song only? c'mon, give us a taste of what else you have to offer, because if you don't you'll end up like so many other one hit wonders out there."
5,Hoku and song are a knockout!,I've been trying to catch the video of this song on TRL all week because I almost fell out of my chair the first time I saw it. Hoku is beautiful and has a great voice. I would surely recommend adding this song to your collection.
1,Hoku is a hit... with children five and under that is!,"Hoku's ridicousily stupid ""Another Dumb Blonde"" is possibly one of the stupidest songs ever writen. Hoku didn't even write the song and the melody and lyrics are horid. Hoku is no small package thoiugh- she's two doughnuts away from 200. The title alone states perfectly what she is- another dumb blonde."
5,AWESOME!,I heard this song on TV and it was the best! I am going to buy the CD and I continuosly listen to it when on my computer! It is one of the coolest songs ever. I think anyone whos everyone will like it!
1,i wouldnt even give this one star,"HO-kuwho names their album another dumb blond? why would you call yourself a dumb blond, especially on the front of your CD. Stupid unintellectual music"
3,"All right song, but take away a star if your sis has....","played it 100 times a day! Just kidding, just kidding, seriously, it's a good song, nothing at all wrong with it, actually. It's not the top hit of the year quite yet, but it's not bad enough for me to say it sucks. I know there are plenty of 8, 9 and 10 year olds out there who have this as their first little taste of real music, before they turn into Kid Rock, Christina Aguilera, Blink 182, Eminem, and Limp Bizkit fanatics, huh? LOL! The song describes a girl (Hoku) who has a boyfriend who has been playing games with her, (hanging out w/ other girls, etc.) and she's letting him know she's stronger than he thinks and won't take that from him. I don't know if younger girls will understand the words of the song, but they do know they gotta dance to it!"
2,This is not so Great,"Well I recently got htis CD in the mail. When I saw the Another Dumb Blonde video on TV I thought the song was OK. Well I figured it only costs about 3 or 4 bucks so why not buy the single. Big Mistake! I would have to say that this CD is one of the worst I own. Hoku is nothing like Britney Spears or Mandy Moore. Her style is a cheap throw off of the Pop stars we all love. Although this CD is very inexpensive, it is not worth the money. This is in no way a good buy."
1,Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!,"this ""music"" is stuff that can give a little boy nightmares. believe me its happened to simlings i'd give names but they choose to stay anonymous. I think sewer rats wrote her only unbelivelby scary song,(maybe racoons). some talent with that one song that she did'nt even write! god when will these non talented teenboppers stop coming. i sugest superman for this problem"
1,"Not another note from Another Dumb Blond, PLEASE !","Come on everyone, how can you be writing these praises of Hoku and her debut, ""Another Dumb Blond"". One of the few times Britney Spears outshines another artist can be found when comparing this single to any of Spears' works ! The lyrics speaks for themselves ! The entire song is nothing but ""make no sense"" lyrics and loud background music coming from a keyboard piano ! Not a catchy song, horrible music, no well written lyrics. Simply don't buy Hoku's, ""Another Dumb Blond"" unless you truly are another dumb blond !"
2,Rather weak,"This is an unfortunate example of pop music. The artist, Hoku, has very weak vocals and is made to sound better by stronger back-up vocalists. It's all well and good for younger kids, but this artist does not have the staying power that some of the other recent acts have shown."
2,Not really what it says,"This book should be called ""A history of religion and philosophers"". I got it to research the attitudes of those opposed to science in history, and there was not much I could lift from it. However it's quite interesting, just not much about science."
5,Ahead of its time,After reading the book I was amazed that a scientist and author from the 19th century was with the knowledge available at the time have such insight and conviction and courage to publish this great piece of work.It makes you wonder what he could have said about all the discoveries made since his time. I think he would have been surprised by how humans still cling to the old believes and superstitions despite all the evidence against it.
5,Friggin' Awesome,"Now, after seeing one review on here, I have to make my thoughts known. This is an absolutely amazing book. How anyone doesn't think that it clarifies exactly what the title dictates, is beyond me. There is a disturbing story that brought tears to my eyes: monks took an educated woman, the bishop was jealous of, stripped her naked - dragged her into the church, where Peter the reader bludgeoned her to death - then scraped the flesh from her bones and burned it all in the fire. I totally see how the conflict between science and religion started, escalated and continues on. It is a great book and extremely well written."
3,this is a disturbing book,"This book isn't really about science or religion per se, though it says a lot about both subjects, it's more a handbook of opinions and how to not write authoritatively. After reading it, I wonder if the FOX channel knows about it. Bigotry and Ignorance are part and parcell of this man's writings."
4,GED PRACTICE TESTS/ANSWER KEY FF,"I really like the book, especially how it goes over the basics, and breaks things down real easy for you. Especially the math portion.However, I do have a question in regards, to the ""Answer Keys"" for the GED Practice Tests. First; the answers that it gives to coincide with the practive tests (especially ""answer key for FF for writing section 1"") isn't making since. Second; the answers for the ""writing section"" are 27 and the actual questions for that section is 28. The rest of the answers keys match up with the questions. I haven't gone over those sections yet. Please reply as I am studying and preparing to take my GED test in April. I've waited a long time to do this, and just want to be sure that I study all the right materials. Thank you."
4,Good CB radio,"My husband and I bought this CB for our son who is a professional trucker. He said that it is a very good radio and he's well pleased with it. It has good sound quality and suits his needs very well. He plans to have a radio shop boost the signal to reach out farther, but even at the range it has now it is a great radio."
4,Cobra CB Radio,Received my order in good time and have installed it in/on my 2006 Jeep. I mounted it on the rear of the center console. The only thing I am going to do to secure it better is make an additional bracket that will cover the existing mounting bolt/screws so it can't be removed or stolen as easy if just left the way it was installed by the instructions. It seems to work just fine. It was well worth the $100 I paid for it. Kenneth
5,Heartfelt and Moving Tribute CD,"This CD is haunting and moving -- and well worth the purchase. Kyle Thompson has a genuine love for Civil War battlefields, American History and battlefield preservation. His passion for history and his empathy with the men who fought there shines through the music. A must-have for Civil War and history buffs."
3,Very Biased View of Civil War,"This CD is well sung and orchestrated. Sadly, it is marred by a virulent anti-Union bias in many of the songs. Particularly offensive is the song ""Andersonville"", which celebrates the deaths of ""You Damn Yankee"" prisoners at that hell-hole.Almost as bad is ""Glory Road"", where Thompson sings gleefully about turning the Union soldiers ""to bone"". A recurring theme of this C/D is the view that Lincoln was a tyrant, the Union soldiers fought mainly to plunder and murder,and that that South was virtuous, brave and pure. A true paean to the Lost Cause and Neo-Confederate propaganda."
4,New slant on an old story,"This is a wonderful, funny book exploring the wrestling that people of faith (and their familes) have in trying to follow the way they understand God is leading them.It captures some of the loneliness of faith, and the difficulties that those close to faith explorers face. We all respect those who actually try to live by their convictions, but living with them can be tough.I learned a new swear word, 'rutting' an ingenious way of inserting harsh reality to the dialogue without resorting to course language.Whoever said that stories of faith have a happy ending, this one has a kind of bitter sweet conclusion. I loved the book and I smile at the recollection of some of the classic lines. Would Jonah work?"
3,Overall interesting...but no Life Of Pi as suggested...,"I am an avid reader of various genres, this novel caught my eye because I am a big fan of Lamb by Christopher Moore and The Life of Pi by Yann Martel. It was suggested in a review that this had elements of one (Pi), and clearly had basis in the other (Lamb). The book was an easy and interesting read, the P.O.V.'s of the characters individual dialog was fresh, and the language was much easier to understand than good old King James. I guess I was hoping for a little more of a ""hook"", but all I got was an interesting retelling of the oft-told tale, albeit with a little feminism tossed in for good measure. I was never tempted to NOT finish the book, but I am really into ""thought provoking"" these days, and in that regard (at least for me) it fell short. If you want an interesting AND thought provoking take on biblical lore, I definitley recommend the afore mentioned novels."
3,Religious Retelling,"A fairly funny retelling of Noah and the Flood; this imagines what life was like for Noah and his clan. I don't usually like so many changes of point of view but it works for this book - each chapter is a different family member and it helps to flesh out the characters by how they see others and how they are seen. Overall, it was pretty good but I preferred Christopher Moore's funnier take on Jesus (Lamb, or the Gospel according to Biff, Jesus's Childhood Friend)."
5,a poignant sustained meditation,"Restrained but luminescent prose, both bawdy and reverent, a fine novel, but for readers prepared to appreciate it, more than that: a sustained, poignant meditation on the ambiguous lot of the believer. That fact that at certain points Noe knows with certainty that God wants him to do something, and that he responds faithfully to that call, does not exempt him from the common human lot. He knows God's absence as well as he knew God's presence. Each character in this tale exhibits another paradigmatic facet of the human-divine relationship. Could be a good book for a spiritual reading group."
1,The Preservationist,"Item arrived in excellent condition....the ""book"" however was a great disappointment. I only was able to listen to a very little of the first disc because of language and content. I was expecting something totally different than this. Very disappointed in it!"
5,Excellent - can't get enough of these Angelique books.,I have read the first nine books and am hoping the last 3 will be translated into English. Did I read where a customer said there were also videotapes? I want this story to last forever.
5,Wonderful... One of the best books I've ever read,"I ran into this book one afternoon at my grandmother's place (she and my aunt kept talking about how great the series was and I never paid much attention to them). That day I was so bored that I decided to take a look at it. To my surprise I LOVED IT, I couldn't stop reading and even took it to work. It is wonderfully written, the Angelique character is very well constructed, the story is believable and the historical background of XVIII century France is magnificiently portrayed. I've just finished Angelique and the Sultan (Indomable Angelica, in Spanish), the fourth in the series and I'm dying to read the next ones but my granma lost them! I looked them up at AMAZON but they're out of print... still, I placed the order and i'm hoping they find them for me. Mr. Publisher: Please reprint them!"
5,The begining of a awesome journey!,"I was 18 when I first read Angelique - all 8 books. It began a love affair for me with 17th Century France and the court of Louis XIV. More than that, a reading journey started for me that still goes on and helped me discover great classics (like those by Dumas & others). I loved Angelique then and do now, 25 years later I still remember those books and the pictures they painted in my mind vividly. READ THESE BOOKS!"
4,A movie series of the books,Marvelous books! I've seen a series of French films bases on the series of Angelique books when I was a child. They made such impression that I have been looking for Angelique books and video tapes. Has anyone come across the tapes?
5,An unforgettable book you can't put down!,"One of the characters in this book called Péguilin summarizes Angélique: (...)""But you...you are a spring in a desert...the dream of someone who has never dreamed...the mysteries...longing, surprise, yearning...the simplest woman in the whole world...and the most unfanthomable...the nearest and yet the farthest...the unassailable...the unforgettable.""Yes, unforgettable! I was 14 years old the first time I read the book and all the others that followed! Twenty years later here I am, still entralled by the wonderful writing of the Golons as they lead us through the court of the Sun King and the survival of Angélique, a strong woman ahead of her time! Great reading! Unforgettable, really!"
5,It's one of the best books i've ever read!,"I've read it when i was only 12 years, and since then i've tried looking for the same books because i've read mine so many time that they are falling into pieces.Also, the last books of Anne Golon aren't printed in English yet! Why not??!?? If all the books, including the last one's were printed in English with new and modern covers, you publisher's would be amazed with the amount of people buying them all! And you can count me in to buy them too!! Please, give a chance to new readers( and us fans) to enjoy Anne Golon's books!"
3,"Honestly, I was a bit disappointed","I've been a Steven Curtis Chapman fan for years - I even met him in Grand Rapids, MI a few years ago. But I was a bit disappointed with this album. It just doesn't seem to be up to the standard of his earlier releases."
2,Always the same.,"i enjoy alot of steven's music, and don't dislike this CD; the only problem being that it sounds the same as ever other album he's ever done. he wasn't even original on his first CD, and now - how many ablums down the road? - he still sounds the same. i wouldn't suggest buying this CD. just buy one and you've heard it all."
5,Heavenly........,"This album is definitely a good investment. I've been a fan of Steven's now for a few years but this is undoubtedly his best one yet. It's really encouraging for anyone whether you're a christian or not, so what can I say except buy it!"
5,"I AM ""SPEECHLESS""","AWESOME, AMAZING, BRILLIANT...I could continue the alphabet, but I won't. I'm sure you get the picture. This is by far the best album I have ever bought. I can't get enough of it. I listen to it every day I run. His best album yet. And anyone who listens to Steven Curtis Chapman knows how difficult it is to top his earlier recordings. It's definitely a MUST HAVE. Get it now...."
5,I am SPEECHLESS,"This album really made me think about the works of God. I am diving into God's love. Oh, and Steven Curtis Chapman is very cute for his age!"
5,Take a leap of faith... Sink or swim I'm driving in,I love this cd. It has great praise and worship music. Speechless has both great lyrics and rhythm. I love all of the songs on Speechless. Steven Curtis Chapman has such a soulful voice. I play them during daycare hours. My daycare toddlers love the music too.
5,His best album yet!,"I have all of Steven Curtis Chapman's stuff and have practically every song memorized, and this is his best. The Dive is without a doubt, one of the best songs he has ever written, only to be topped by His Strength is Perfect from the Real Life Conversations album. Speechless is awesome, The Next 5 minutes is challenging, and The Fingerprints of God is inspiring. If you really liked this album, your next venture should be The Great Adventure or For the Sake of the Call. (The Signs of Life wasn't absolutely terrific). Chapman is great, I know the Lord must be behind his work!"
4,SURPRISING.,"I bought this album based on word-of-mouth without hearing any of the tracks, so I didn't know what to expect since I am not familiar with SCC's other stuff. I like this album. It had enough diversity in the arrangements to make it interesting, and his voice handled the different styles well. I like the combination of guitars and strings. Thumbs up."
5,A must buy for any christian music fan!!!!,I just got this cd and I absolutely love it. Steven has done some great song writing on this one. This album has some songs that could easily be done in a worship setting and stuff that's just really great to listen to.
4,all over the map,"Usually I enjoy Steven Curtis Chapman's ability to incorporate a number of styles and moods in each album. This album is no different from other SCC releases in that it covers a wide range of music, from hard to soft, joyful to sorrowful. Yet somehow these songs just don't gel like they have on previous albums.Everything starts off with a bang, with the rousing Dive and Speechless. There are several very strong tracks in the mix, but somewhere in the middle we encounter Next 5 Minutes, possibly the closest I've heard to a Christian version of ""The Song That Doesn't End"". From there it all seems to fall apart. Individually, most of the songs are great. They just don't all seem to belong together. Don't be surprised if you find yourself hitting the skip button from time to time, depending on your mood.Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory"
3,"SCC is still the best, though changes not for the best.","I excitedly bought this cd having ""Great Expectations"",(Seeing that SCC really is the best CCM artist!) only to notice changes, that in my opinion, weren't for the best. Though the songs,""The Fingerprints of God"", ""Be Still and Know"", ""What I Really Want to Say"", ""Great Expectations"", ""Speechless"", and others were good, there were others that weren't. Like ""Dive"" and the musical verses for ""The Change"". I have to agree that SCC's lyrics and meaning are still one of kind, though SCC's unique mix of musical artistry and lyrics on past albums are more superior when compared to this one. Overall this album was good, though I felt it could have been better had SCC not changed his musical style quite so much!"
3,STEVEN CURTIS CHAMPMAN PREVAILS ONCE AGAIN!!!,"WOW, WOW. THIS CD IS SO POWERFUL I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL"
3,"Amazing Lyrics, ok Music!","As usual, SCC has blown me away by his creativity in his lyrics. However, I feel that he concentrated so much on the lyrics, that he lost some of the musical passion from previous albums. Think about the chords and catchy melodies of The Great Adventure, Let Us Pray, I Will Be Here, King of the Jungle, Lord of the Dance.......compared to some of the not so catchy music on his new album. Dive, speecless, and fingerprints of God are very good musically, but the rest are so so..."
5,Can't remember if I've reviewed it yet...,"...pweese do forgive me if I have. It's a great, great album. It was the second SCC album I ever got (after falling in love with Greates Hits I was overjoyed to get Speechless for my birthday!), and it remains one of my favorites. ""Dive"" is a wonderful song, another one of those that makes you want to get up and dance (or, in this case, dive in!). The title song is pretty good, and, well, all the rest are great, most especially ""Fingerprints of God"", ""The Journey"" (actually J.A.C. Redford gets credit for that, as it's instrumental), and ""With Hope"" can make you cry if you're not careful. ""What I Really Want to Say"", though not as acoustically pretty as some other ballads to Mary Beth, is touching and so, so true. ""The Invitation"" is the only song you'll want to skip. So, all in all, this new entry from the incredibly cute Kentucky boy gets five stars.~ Child of the Burning Heart"
1,Great C.D.,"This is a great c.d. It has upbeat songs, and is really fun to listen to, and it's about the most important thing of all... GOD!"
3,Good CD,"If this would be your fist time hearing Steven Curtis Chapman, you would fall in love with his style and his lyrics, and his voice, but after hearing, and owning three of his previous hit albums, you start to see a pattern. Almost every single song is the same. The lyrics are always different, and get better with each CD, but the music just doesn't change. If you're looking for a SCC CD, I would suggest Signs of Life first. Maybe the most, and only orginal to come out of Steven since his career began."
5,Brilliant,"I never expect anything less from Steven Curtis Chapman. The lyrics, the music, the guitar, everything proves that he is amazingly telented. The fact that he uses his talents to praise God inspires me. I thank God for him."
4,SCC is back in full-force!,"What a great CD. I think this is definitely one of SCC's best releases. Some great new stuff, but all with a very recognizable SCC ""feel."" Great gift for people new to SCC, a definite must-have for SCC fans."
5,fun earrings!,"I bought these for my daughter who likes to wear different and interesting earrings. She is a frog collector so it was a double whammy for her! She likes them and wears them to work often. They are well made...can't go wrong with these if you like to be a little different, also good conversation starter."
1,Range is just awful,"Ok, how do I explain? I've been picked up off and on during the years. Each time I'm picked up, I get probed. And not just by a little gray. And not just once or twice. The whole darn ship of 'em line up to probe me. Repeatedly.So, I bought this device, thinking that if it went off, I'd have time to escape to my lead-lined safe room, or at least grab a weapon. So what happened? Not what I expected. It didn't give me any warning at all. The range is extremely limited. Only later did I see the disclaimer: ""For best results, hold directly under saucer.""Anyway, I woke up in the ship as I was being probed. And this stupid product was beeping. It kept beeping the whole time that I was being probed by every single crewman. Do you have any idea how annoying it can be to hear tinny beeping as you are being probed by a ship full of grays?Worst of all, the company would not give me a refund."
1,Been Abducted Twice!!,"After my first abduction I sought out to arm myself with something that would prevent this from happening to me again. Alas, the UFO Detector.Since then my microwave, TV, radio, and cellphone have been causing the device to alarm several times, sending me in a state of panic where I'd hide under my bed for days. Next time it went off it was no false alarm. And I was, again, on board an alien vessle with probes hanging from every opening of my body.I'd guess that for this ""Detector"" to work you'd need to be in an environment free from all electrical interferences. Above all, I DO NOT recommend this product."
1,This item sucks,"Seriously...After like two times it breaks. The first time, upon encountering the UFO the device started to shutter and shake REALLY bad and then lost all power. The second time, well...that time was mostly okay, but the third time it didn't work at all. I had to get out of bed with a flashlight and when I finally got the UFO to come over, the device just sat there like it was a toaster or something. Seriously, if your looking for a GOOD UFO detector, look elsewhere."
3,UFOs and More!,"While this detector can't compete with the UFO-O2 Detector for looks and speed, it does come with a sweet little detachable handle and a set of bingo balls that makes it a great addition to church socials!"
1,Got me abducted!,"I was fishing at a lake not far from me and had the device with me. It failed to detect a UFO, and before I know it, they scooped me up in a giant glowing fishing net and carried me to Neptune where I was then probed, injected with I have no idea what, and mercifully, fed quite well. They gave me steak, they were quite nice after the probing actually.I would not recommend this detector, I would not want anybody else to get probed by it."
1,Works too good,"I bought this to see if there were any aliens here, but since I was in Texas near the Tex/Mex boarder, my alarm would not turn off! Every time I went to home depot or walmart it would go off and I could never get it to turn off! Also when I take it near my vegetables and fruits it goes off, so I have to wrap them in tin foil, which is a hassle. I wonder if there going to release one that detects immigrants.....misc was here...."
1,are you that stupid ?,Really? The other reviewers bought this piece of &*%$ ? Can you say shills. Rather than buy this why not take your money and flush it down the toilet as a way of communicating with the little green men?
2,Interesting read,"I like this book, it contains basic information on the Sabbats and includes some handy crafts for you to perform during each Sabbat and some history on them. However the writing is so random you can hardly spot *where* was that thing you saw and wanted to do. But it's nice."
3,disorganized but a delight for the handcraft-oriented,"If you are pagan and you enjoy things like cooking and making things at holidays, this collection of craft ideas will probably appeal to you a great deal. This book contains a wealth of such ideas, more or less strung together at random. (It's supposedly organized by Sabbat, but I'd take that with a grain of salt.)If you are looking for valuable history or theology, look elsewhere. Just as one might buy Buckland's blue book for the reference materials or Starhawk for the beautiful incantations and ritual poetry, one would buy this one for the creativity it inspires."
5,Wonderful Sabbat info,"While Llwellyn has been publishing a set of books, one for each Sabbat, this book is the best source for lore, crafts, recipes, magic, and ritual for the Sabbats.Poetic and full of wonderful artwork, this book doesn't treat pagan holidays as a childish game. The folklore is wonderful and accurate, the crafts are relevant to the season, and the magic and ritual is simple and powerful.This should be in all pagan libraries."
4,A good sourcebook...,"Many books will cover the topic of the Sabbats and what is traditional in celebrating them. But few books actually go into detail on specific crafts and recipes that can be done at the time of each Sabbat. For those lacking in funds or resourcefulness, this gives them an opportunity to start their own traditions using the crafts, recipes, and decorating ideas contained within. One problem, however...I felt that perhaps when discussing the various crafts they should perhaps offset them from the rest of the page so that one could see where they mentioned one. I've spent many an hour searching through pages trying to find the paragraph (and they all look the same) that begins the recipe for pumpkin bread, or straw weaving. All in all, a very good book to have on your shelf if you plan to celebrate the Sabbats in style."
5,Best lube around!,"We go through quite a bit of lube in our house, and this is by far the best. It doesn't get sticky or leave residue, it literally just lets your hands glide over anything smoothly. No mess, its super easy to clean up and the slickness lasts for a long time, so you dont have to use as much. I also really like it because it doesn't taste bad, I actually dont notice it at all if I happen to be licking something that has been previously covered in lube. Just use the lube until you stop feeling that smooth glide and either reapply or try something else. Its more of a moisturizer than anything, and when it dries, you can't tell that you used anything in the first place - no cleanup! Its great. And this bottle lasts forever. We go through quite a bit of it and this bottle has lasted us 6 months. Really great value for the price and really high quality stuff. I wouldn't consider using anything else."
2,Wrong Stuff,"Product not as pictured. Ordered the Silicone Personal Lubricant as shown but received the Gel.The original stays slippery for a long time, enhancing the wife's pleasure.Gel gets sticky and is a turn-off for her."
1,oil??,"even though is not oil, it feels like it. that might be good to an extent, but if you can't wash it off with water, i don't think you want it inside you."
2,Not for me,I loved the feel of this lub but it left me itchy and sore after using it twice. I have used other silicone products but have never hurt afterward. Must be something new in this one.
3,Fear of Intimacy,"I have a couple of albums with Charlie Shavers as a sideman, playing with either Ray Bryant or Hal Singer, and they are pretty solid so I figured why not try something by him as a leader. Unfortunately this title finds the trumpeter performing with orchestra, and while the mood may be ""intimate"" to some, I just think the recordings sound like sappy movie music. For those who care, this disc collects the original albums ""The Most Intimate"" and ""Gershwin, Shavers & Strings,"" both from 1955. I got this disc cheap in the Marketplace, but now I'm reluctant to get anything else by Shavers regardless of price."
4,A good little adventure,"Although personally I do not believe the writers best work (Hornblower is just incredible), it is still a fantastic read. One of the best writers I believe in anything associated with maritime and naval stories.This story has only a few elements to work with but creates a great light read. The story is so good there is no need for any major complex twists, turns or tricks making it very digestible. A welcome read if you have just spent the last few books in heavy intense thrillers or of the like.The writer obviously knew what they were talking about as some of the details are not only incredibly interesting, but also incredible at creating suspense. The details do not bore you at all and treats you like you are intelligent enough to understand what is being said, which is a massive relief from the spoon feeding of other writers.The book is a well written breath of fresh air. Like tea on the porch in the fall. lol."
2,Plot much different than the movie,"I really loved the movie, but just want to warn you that the last part of the book is wildly different than the movie, and pretty much of a bummer....... Neither of the characters come off as being very likable. I was very disappointed and wished I hadn't read it. I am a big fan of C. S. Forester's Hornblower series, but it's obvious that he has a very cynical view of women and married life, and it comes through much more strongly in The African Queen."
3,African Queen - too little for a book - but a fine screen play,"The African Queen - C.S. Forrester. Weak. Good, but weak. The movie may have won an academy award but the book comes up short. More of a novella, or screenplay than a book. The author could have doubled the text and it may well have been a good book. I appreciate the drama of the two people pulled from separate worlds that are changed dramatically by unfolding events and raise themselves to previously unimagined feats of character and bravery. Still, it was a wasted effort, two little to hang it all on and a pointless ending."
4,The devil is in the detail,"C S Forester knew his business. He knew a plausible method of turning an old river steamer into a torpedo, he knew the hellish consequences of losing a prop blade, of mooring in a mangrove swamp, of finding still water in a rapid.. And as he has proven so many times in the Hornblower novels, he knows the way of knaves and gentleman... This is a book for any age."
1,too much scratch on DVD,"The drama was great, but the product I bought had severe scratches and I had to give up 1/2 of contents."
5,Korean movie The Great Queen Seondeok,Great movie. Well directed and true historic account of the life of the Queen. Great action and plot. Not like some of those cheap Chinese movies.
1,THIS FAKE AND MEDIOCRE PRODUCTION,"After watching some great Chinese productions (The Banquet, The Golden Flower etc.), I bought this based upon the five star rating here. It is garbage, period."
5,Great Singer-Songwriter Rock,"An album full of well-written songs, both lyrically and musically, surrounded by ringing guitars and the occasional organ.The vocals may not be for everyone but they do bring the emotions across.It's an interesting mix of Scandinavian melancholy and veryNew York-sounding rock. Nice cover too."
1,THEY DONT COME MORE PRETENTIOUS,I checked this CD out because the awesome Amy Madden played and sang backup (hey I hope the money was worth it!) and I found out on the net that she was on this. This guy has to be kidding! ME ME ME ME like who cares about this Tom Petty copycat with the annoying voice. PREEE TEN SHUS!! Dont quit your day job. And hey! when am I going to get the next AM CD its been too long.
5,A thoroughly satisfying novel.,"Twenty-year-old Nicki is bound for a high-powered law career when she learns that her headaches mean she has not long to live. Refusing to enter a hospital or live out her remaining months at home, she embarks on a cruise, only to fall in love with the man of her dreams. Should she continue to hide her illness from a man who can never share a future with her? All the Time in the World is a powerful account which is unique and moving. Highly recommended."
5,This is the Best book I've ever read!,This book is the best. If you're looking into a good romancenovel this is the one to pick! Once you start reading it you can't putit down! I can't wait till they make the movie!
3,not too bad,"This movie reminded me of the movie ""Speed"". It wasn't anything real exciting, but it wasn't too bad."
5,"books 3-9, not 3-4","Contrary to the reviewer who says it is not clear that this is only one volume of 3, I thought there was 6 or 7 volumes altogether. The title clearly says ""The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol.2: Books 3-4"", so obviously this is volume 2 of a collection. Knowing that the original Elements had 13 books, my assumption was there must be several more volumes in this new edition. Actually, Amazon's title of the book is wrong! If you look at the front cover, or the index of this book, you can see that it says ""Vol.2 (Books III-IX)"". And if you are interested to know, volume 1 covers books I and II, and volume 3 covers books X through XIII so altogether they cover the original Elements entirely.Update (10/14/2010):At the time I wrote the previous review, the book's title was ""The Thirteen Books of the Elements, Vol.2: Books 3-4"". Obviously Amazon must have realized the mistake and corrected the title to ""...: Books 3-9"")"
1,Buyers remorse that inspires anger...,"I can't believe I bought the back cover hype, and purchased this book. Mr. Roberto should have begun most sentences with, ""Uh..."". Lacking confidence, he speculates on the shallow, obvious sides of Neal's brilliant lyrics. I can only surmise that a Writers Club Press saw dollar signs, conspired with a bogus editer, and convinced Mr. Roberto that his internet thoughts would make a good book. But, c'mon Len, this book is in your name, and your reputation. How could you have not fleshed out this manuscript to make it readable? Skip this book, and read Mystic Rythums."
3,Lacking a philosophical direction,"I found this book entertaining, sometimes finding myself nodding emphatically over the author's interpretation of a particular song, but often shaking my head and thinking, ""What?""The startling omission in this book was the author's (someone who claims to have read ""everything"" about Rush on the internet) complete lack of knowledge (mention, in fact) of the philosophical system of Objectivism. Peart is himself an Objectivist, and most of Rush's songs have an Objectivist point of view. Some of the author's interpretations are decidededly non-Objectivist in nature.We all draw our own interpretations from Rush's songs, and there's no saying that my interpretation is any better than anyone else's. I just found it odd that in a book claiming interpretations of songs by a band with a decidedly Objectivist slant, there is no discussion or even mention of Objectivisism."
3,"Excellent Resource, But Slowly Becoming Dated","The format of the book is perfect for writers who want access to pertinent information. Though Edelstein builds his points logically, technically one can bounce around the book reading only those points that are important at the moment.However, I would encourage the author to come out with an updated version as there are a small, yet important number of aspects of writing that have evolved since the books publication in 1999, especially in the arena of self-publishing and the now dramatically increased role the Internet has on marketing.Still, there are gems aplenty in what is now a classic reference book for writers."
1,It's self evident . . .,"Type this author's name in the amazon search and see what comes up: nothing but books about how writers can get published. I.E. if you want to make a living as writer, then write books that gullible people will buy. If this person is unable to get their work, other than books about getting published, published then it's self evident that one should not take the advice in his books seriously, there is no evidence that it works for anything but books about how to get published (or, it may be seen, he has, technically, published two books about how to make it through college as a student, something that is minimally useful and, also, seems to have gone out of print quite rapidly, i.e. did not sell well).Unless, of course, your only desire is to write books about how to get published, then you should take his advice, in such a particular case as that he seems to know what he's talking about."
5,Enter t.A.T.u.'s world!,"First of all I'd like to point out that these girls are NOT lesbians. It may have been an act but in the words of lena (the red-head) ""We never said we were lesbians, we just love each other"" Ok, now the disc is pure amazing joy! Yes they can sing!! These girls give electronic pop techno a new meaning! they really know how to hit it off. Every song is worth mention in this album! they all talk about stuff you could understand and like! If you like this album check out their russian counterpart, which dare I say is even better! They also have a new album ""Dangerous and Moving"" and it also is terribly good. Check them out!"
4,Very Good...BUT I expected More...,"I absolutely love this album. I think that the music and whole message behind their music is awesome. BUT, I expected more than 8 songs on the album. Track 9-10 is a translation of tracks 1 and 2 into Russian (but they're really good! they sound even better in Russian!) And Track 11 is just a repeat of track 3 only 30 seconds longer. BUT this album is outstanding anyway..."
5,Fantastic,"I first heard of t.A.T.u through my younger sister. I loved the single ""All the things she said"" and when I bought the album I loved all their songs. It is a fantastic album and the mixture of dance and pop work really well.My only problem is that one of the tracks ""stars"" has large sections in russian and as I dont speak russian I dont know what they are singing about.but that is my only problem. The album is superb and I will be looking out for future releases from the duo."
5,a great cd!!,"This was a really great cd. One of the best that I've heard and I love all the songs. The lyrics are meaningful, the beats are catchy, and at some times the vocals tend to screech and go really high, they sing really well. All of the songs are good although I dont know why they put ""show me love"" twice...one says it the extended version but It sounded the same. It was good. It was worth the money I spent and I was happy I did."
2,"Awesome Beats, Horrible singing.","I highly respect the producers for making such nice songs. Unfortunately it's ruined by two Russian ""lesbian"" couples. The singing is horrible; they use their ""good enough"" voice and edit it on music software. I have no idea why people think they're so good. It's because most people are only attractive by the lesbian acts or their cute looks."
3,The Boring Commentary By others,"Maximum of 1,000 words? Sadly, some do use this text to write a thousand words about a group that was brilliantly masterminded by one of the best producers in the business, you put two well underage teenage girls with mild talent and loud musical effects and sounds into a recording studio, pronounce them bonified lesbians, wow, you're a millionaire.So I have not bothered to purchase the CD, I do listen to their music, it has a light flare to it with a modern spunk, some are still mindless to the thought of who T.A.T.U really is, thats ok, best song by them is the Nas song, most of their english is poor, I say merchandise it out like Rammestein, sing it all in Russian and German for a few years, wait it out, then sell an album in english, you've stretched out your popularity, now they'll have to resort to more risque images and clothing to sell albums by next year.Oh well.Review by, Mercedes. Musical Producer. 2003"
2,Tatu Stinks!,Tatu will never appear on the cover's of the pop magazines like Justin Timberlake and Avril lavigne did when they succeeded on their first albums.Tatu are just obnoxious with their songs and music.The lyrics to the songs are constantly repeated and they look like their everywhere when you look at them by analyzing. Those background laughs in ''30 minutes'' are annoying and know this none of Tatu's videos appeared on muchmore music but Avril lavigne's did.It's easy to explain how come ''not gonna get us now'' didn't make it on the countdown which pop videos usually do because it wasn't popular and not very good. It looks embarassing when the British banned a Tatu video and not letting Julia into a Mcdonalds.It just looks so phony that these girls are homosexual and they probably aren't...they probably do what their manager told them what to do. Tatu are shams and you should feel ashamed by wasting your money on this disgraceful exploitation of a Europop album.
1,their lesbian schtick is running thin,"god, this music is soooo annoying! and didn't Britney already do the schoolgirl thing? they can only kiss each other while performing so many times before everyone gets tired of it.boring."
2,Alvin and the Chipmunks Go Techno/Electro-Pop!!!,"If you don't belive me, listen to track #7.Several of the songs on this CD try to evoke emotion, put fall flatly on their collective face. I don't blame the vocalist(s), but the struggle to phonetically get through the English lyrics is at times amusing. In contrast (and in all fairness), the two tracks that are in Russian, in my opinion, are far more provoking. It's a shame that the marketing machine has managed to bury their talent."
4,yeah,"This is a great C.D. It is hard enough to get into the american music industry from our own country, and these girls did it from Russia. I bought both C.D.'s and I don't know anything but english!...be proud...support the artists!"
3,Enjoyable!,"I spent two months waiting for this CD to come out, and I wasn't disappointed. It's a great CD, full of uplifting, sing-along, dance-along type music that keeps you humming all day long, which is quite an accomplishment with me, at least. It was definitely worth the money; don't let my somewhat mediocre rating fool you. I love t.a.T.u. and I love this CD; however, the Russian version is much, much, MUCH better than the English version. After you purchase this and like it, I highly recommend the Russian version. Nothing like the real thing. :)"
4,A great listen....,"This cd is a great listen, I really enjoy the ""How Soon is Now?"" cover (an old the smiths song). There is a few flaws in there english songs but they are obviously new to the language and I wish Lena and Julia could express themselfs more through the english language when it comes to the enhanced movies on there CD but they run into there language barrier.It does seem that they are a heavily produced duo on stage and off but there is so many pop acts in America currently that are worse so I don't see this as much of a problem since they are both young and need direction til they can find there own musical journey to take. Hopefuly as there english learning progresses and they can express themselfs more through lyrics and interviews they will be a fantastic act to watch in the future.Good luck breaking through into the USA, it is a tuff journey and I hope you plot it well else they will become a one-hit-wonder in America."
5,a suprise,"Yes, we're all sick of gimmicky corporate plans to have us buy cds, and yes we almost always fall for them. I bought the TATU cd and...well....I actually loved it. If you've seen Britney or Christina lately, then these two Russian girls shouldn't shock you. The music is awesome and the blend of the vocals works very well with it all throughout the cd. I especially enjoyed the Russian versions of some of their songs. Basically, it was put together very well and I'll look forward to their next cd."
4,Pretty album but they suck,"I have to admit it, this record is cool! Almost all the songs (well, they aren't so many)are enjoyable. My fav are All The Things She Said and Stars, but I liked also the remake of How Soon Is Now. Good music, their voices ain't bad...their cd could have been worse, really! Anyway the fact remains, they are 2 simple craps. They have found a great way to get famous immediately, they know that being [...] is a bit ""fashion"" nowadays. They could have shown to the world their musical talent without being fake lesbians! They don't like singing but making scandalous things (and I'm not referring to their [...] but to the fact that they wanted to kiss in the videoclips just to make world talk of them...I hate these kind of things! Nothing against [...] people!). Apart from this, 200 km/h in the wrong lane remains an appreciable album."
2,Alot of room for improvement...,"t.A.T.u (translated into 'she likes that girl') is so new and shocking only because of their image. They kinda make it seem like they're only in this for a publicity stunt (namly because they're lesbians.) I kinda find that sick, and despite that, their lyrics are just nothing by rambling on and on and on. However, I will give them thumbs up for the rythm on most of their tracks (which is why their music is appealing aside the fact that their foriegn.) I just hope that next time their lyrics would be more important and defining in their future albums."
5,t.A.T.u.,I love t.A.T.u. I have been a fan of them since I was about 10yrs old :)The remixes are absolutely AMAZING!
5,One my of favorite CD's,"I love this Cd! It's one of my favorite Cd's of all time. ""All the things she said..all the things she said.."" Lol..memories. I didn't like their new Cd as much as this one. This CD is classic.. 100%"
3,"It's OK, but too much screaming.","In my opinion I don't think this CD is all that bad. I have a hard time listening to the whole thing at once. Their singing (well, yelling) becomes a little aggrevating after some time. I wish they would sing instead of yelling all their songs. As for the actual songs...Not bad, they are catchy and provide some great music to mix/dance with, with a little touch of UK sound."
2,in the Wrong Lane is true...,"Flash in the pan. In the United States anyway. This duo may be popular in Russia, but I don't see how these girls will ever be more than their one hit ""All The Things She Said"" here in the U.S. Their music is over the top bubble gum pop. They have a couple of songs that have a catchy beat to them which make them passable, but the majority of the album doesn't even have that going for it. Their sound tends to remind me of music from an anime film. They have two things going for them... 1) They're very attractive girls and in this day and age appearance matters as much if not more than the music itself (see Britney for proof)... and 2) Their songs are already synth pop so it's easy for Dj's to remix them into electronica dance songs.In the end they have only two songs even worth listening to... ""All The Things She Said"" and ""Clowns"" because of their catchy beats. I would suggest buying these on singles instead of the whole album."
5,Experience t.A.T.u,"200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane by t.A.T.u diserves 5 stars, because these girls are very under~rated and overlooked. The CD is worth buying. Not only does it have their awesome hit single -All the Things She said- in this CD but many other great songs. If you heard and like their song, ""All the Things She said"" then you will like almost every song on this CD! One of my favorites on the CD is ""Not Gonna Get Us."" A soon as I heard the t.A.T.u single I loved it and the song stood in my head, and I immediatly knew I had to get the 200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane CD. At that time I never heard of them before but the song was just so catchy and good I wanted to hear more of their songs, so I purchased the 200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane CD and I don't regret buying it! This CD has become one of my favorites. The only drawback is the CD is a little short, but it does leave you wanting more and after buying this CD I can't wait to hear the next CD and songs they will make."
5,Amazed,"I grew up in a very music oriented family and being so I like all different kinds of music, but it is very rare for a CD to come around that I can't stop listening to. t.A.T.u's music is like a breath of fresh air. It is a new sound that harkens back to other music i've heard but in such a way that I have to hear it again and again."
3,"generally,it's ok","well, i still dont understand why my friends love this album dat much. To me, only "" all the things she said "" is pretty good, the others... nah"
1,Gimmicks don't make good music!,"It's hard to take the music seriously when I doubt that they're even being honest about their sexuality.Music-wise, it sounds like old-school Britney Spears trying to rock out - horrible on paper, even horribler live (I know that horribler isn't a word, but this stuff is so bad, that it deserves a new word for bad that means ten thousand times worse than CRAP!) Clever idea, trying to capitalize on an industry driven by sex appeal, but little more than that. Even watching them make out on stage gets boring after a while."
2,Lack of vocal ability,"While this CD may be good for dancing purposes, it has no depth in terms of lyrics and the vocals are very weak artistically to call the two girls who pretend to lead a gay lifestyle for publicity purposes singers."
1,TATU,"This is the worst CD I have ever listened to. First fo all, the translation is just awful. I kind of liked their music when it was in russian (At least it made sense)."
4,I Like Unique,"I don't care what others negative thoughts are about the group t.A.T.u. The truth is, they are different? I mean come on how many other artists have two girls singing together, with totally different personalities, singing these songs in which some dont' make entirely any sense? The truth is I don't want to see any other little Britney's, or Christina Aguilera's. That's just the view from Americans and t.A.T.u. is unique, and they have something different that other artists don't. That is why I like there music...Secondly who says in the year 2010 we won't be listening to chipmunks? Things change in time."
5,All The Things They Said,"Julia and Lena, two girls from Moscow, Russia, thrashed the charts with their mouth droppin single, all the things she said. Their new album,200 Km/h in the Wrong Lane, is one of the best I have heard in a long time. Their outright, in your face, bold show of lesbian love is just captivating. I've been obsessed with the song from the moment I heard it. It's almost scary how fast it has blown up, and so much support, I've never seen anything like it. Most bands have a fan club for a while and then they fade, but t.A.T.u. has a loving community of fans and so much support. Why not? The two sexy chicks from Russia have a lot of fans from gays and lesbians, and bisexuals. Everything they do is just eye-opening. If you want to know more, visit the website, ... and find out for yourself!"
4,This Russian Techno duo is awesome,"Everyone keeps comparing these girls to Britney Spears, Cristina Aguilera, and groups like the Indigo Girls or Spice Girls. How further from the truth. If your new to Tatu and wondering wether to buy this CD or not they are a teenage lesbian duo (the name tatu literally translated means girl loves girl). Yet any band who plays with such Metal artists as Ramnstein and Prodigy is far from the Aaron Carter or Britney Spears genre. They are more pop fuesed with Industrial (techno and hard rock). Most of the songs are really electronic, hence the techno, and they sound alot more like Madonna than the Spice Girls. The best songs on this album are ""All the Things She Said"", ""Not Gonna Get Us"", and ""Ya Soshla S Uma"" which means I've lost my mind. If you want the shock rock style like Marilyn Manson or Skillet, but fuesed with Pop then you'll like Tatu; and if your one of those Avril Lavigne posers then try something real. I hate most pop, but this group is pretty good."
4,Best music I've heard in years,"Some people might think that tATu is Russia's answer to Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera. They're completely wrong. tATu's music is so hopelessly addictive that you can't get the songs out of your head, and they're actually GOOD.The first track ""Never Gonna Get Us"" starts with a funky dance/trance beat, and even though the singer's voice is a bit shrill at the beginning of the song, the whole thing just grooves with energy later on. The next track ""All The Things She Said"" is, in my opinion, the strongest piece on the CD. Other great songs include ""Clowns"" and ""Gay Boy.""The only reasons I'm giving it four out of five stars is because the videos included on the CD are much too dark to view on a computer screen, and because the CD is short, about 40 minutes if you don't include the remix. But hey, this is one fantastic piece of music!"
4,A very unique recording - very varied!,"This recording is very unique. I had to listen to it twice to fully understand all of the influences. This may sound a bit odd, but I hear part Teletubbie vocals, Cirque du Soleil melodies and vocals, Soho guitar rifts and edgy rock vocals. This album crosses all the genres and is yet consistent.I wasn't sure I was glad I bought the album after the first spin, but I was surely glad after the second spin."
5,A Wonderful Prodigy,"For a poppish band, t.A.T.u. is a wonderful new sound in the music industry. They're a great new thing, and if no one has ever heard them sing it's a darned shame because these two girls have some of the most hypnotic voices I've ever heard. Their sound is uplifting, and have good meanings. Be who you are!"
4,Next Milli Vanilli?,"I like all types of music. If something sounds good, I'll like it. I don't care who it's by, if it's on the radio or not, if the artists even perform or compose their own songs. That said, I really do like some of T.A.T.U.'s songs. However, they make me think a lot of Milli Vanilli. Download a video of T.A.T.U. performing live and it's a joke! They are soooo lip synching! That makes me wonder if the 2 girls even really sing on the album. Anyway, it still sounds good. I just question what's really going on here. Whoever composed the songs is very talented. Same goes for the singers...whoever they are."
3,Okay! Not the best!,"Sure, some people may say ""Their lesbians, all they do is make-out on tv for attention"", despite comments like this, their album is actually pretty good! They gave good songs, but I gave it 3 stars because they have a remix to their track ""Show Me Love"" and all that they ahve that is different is extra sounds at the beginning. I think that was very disorganized and only put together so they could add another song onto their album. I also think they try to act like lesbians too much for attention and they say it in their ""Malchik Gay"" song. They also have song titles in german and some lyrics in german. It is just ok! I also gave it 3 stars because some songs make you want o slit your rist, especially if the bahtos are in a car with you!"
2,"the music is okay, but the gimic bothers me.","T.A.T.U., I don't quite know what to do with you. I actually enjoy the music, not despite or because of the ""gimick"" ..., but I enjoyed the sound of the group before I comprehended the words or saw the video. Now I myself quite enjoy the idea of girls in love,... But when it comes to this subject, I like to see the subject of teenage [relationships] handled more delicatly. Because otherwise it's just feeding into the latest fad. ..."
5,Look out Manson,Look out Shirley Manson and Courtney Love! T.A.T.U's album really rocks! After All The Things She Said was released months ago I anxiously awaited the release of their album ... and it was well worth the wait! Both girls voices carry a very wide range and the combination of their styles makes for a very unique sound. But aside the much hyped lesbian relationship of these two Russian teen vamps because once you hear the cd you'll only want more. The music speaks louder than any marketing stratagem and it screams FIERCE!
4,I didnt expect it to be this good.,Seriously speaking hen i ordered this CD i didnt expect it to do some wonders. But it eventually turned out to be a gr8 one.
5,best cd by t.a.t.u,i just got the cd of t.a.t.u in its great there vocies are great the songs in lyrics plus the beats are great this cd is a must get cd its unlike anything out there ( SO WHY YA READING THIS FOR GET YA ASS UP IN GO BUY THE CD NOW ) trust me this cd is a money's worth cd its the best this cd will keep you wanting more so go buy it
5,The Best!,"Tatu is the first Russian group to be such a success around the world. I heard all of their albums and every one of them is great. Everyone should find something that they like from this cd for sure.P.S. TA lybit TY is the meaning of their name, which means one girl loves another one.TATU is the best of the best!"
3,Spicy Russian fare on an American Menu,"I prefered the girls Russina language album better as the emotion on some songs is conveyed much more effecively, especially on àì (track 4) - a very powerful song in Russion, a good song in English - which translated to ""Stars"" on 200 kph in the Wrong Lane.Julia and Lena have great voices and the CD is very easy to listen to all the way through over and over. The English album does not have translations of all the songs on the Russian album and there is a great cover of ""How Soon is Now"" where the girls' accents come through in an innocently sexy way.I'd recommend buying the Russian language CD first and then after listening to it a few times, buy this CD. Analyzing the differences adds anew dimension to the enjoyment as can hunting down translations of the original Russian and seeing how the meanings can change."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I wasn't expecting much from these ""lesbian posers"" but I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to the album. The super-addictive ""all the things she said"" really got to me so I bought the CD. There's some pretty good stuff on here despite their high-pitched singing. Tracks like ""not gonna get us"", ""show me love"" and ""stars"" are really well done.On the other hand 200KM/H IN THE WRONG LANE IS a really short CD with only 8 songs. The other 3 tracks are Russian versions of ""all the things she said"", ""not gonna get us"" and an extended version of ""show me love"". Lyrically this CD deals with gay love. Even the straight forward ""malchik gay"" deals with being in love with a gay boy.Despite Lena & Julia's girl-on-girl gimmick, 200KM IN THE WRONG LANE is worth checking out."
4,Amazing,"The sound that T.A.T.U. has is very interesting, and while their image is being marketed to overly-hormonal straight teenage boys, their message is great, even if ignored, and something to be paid attention to by all people.I'm saddened by the way they're being portrayed and reviewed. Being lesbian is not something to ""turn on"" the boys. It is not something to sell their music. It is the way they are, and making music about it is no more remarkable than any of the hundreds of artists making songs about heterosexual love.The album is awesome - but buy it for the right reasons."
4,Outstanding Dance Music - New and Fresh,"When I picked up this CD, I was only interested in the 2 hits songs. After hearing the rest of the album, WOW!! This stuff rocks. The style of music is catchy and unique. Russian versions of the songs are neat but I would have liked to see a full album of songs.Hope to see a followup full album."
5,Step aside poser Pop! t.A.T.U 's here t stay!,"With a sond that mixes Techno and Pop, its easy to see why t.A.T.u is a band that will make it big. Originally from Russia, these two lesbian teens smashed ont the seen with ""All The Things She Said"", a song that depicts the life of two girls in love while being loked down upon by society. With other songs like ""Theyre Not Gonna Get Us"", apparently a song about people trying to change them(?), these girs look like they are ready to take on the world without taing any crap. It should be interesting to see how well they do in America compared to how they did in Europe. If yor into up-beat poppy techno, this cd should be on your ""Things to buy"" list!"
5,Good CD; i enjoyed mostly all the songs,"Normally this style of music gets annoying to me after a few minutes. However, I found that I could listen to song after song and I really enjoyed them. Even the songs that are not completely in English I was digging because they had upbeat, cool sounding music and the chorus was catchy even though I didn't know what it meant. Most CD's I have bought recently like Britney and Christina only have a couple of good songs and the rest of the CD I don't bother to listen to. But with this CD you get about 8 very good songs and the other songs r pretty ok too. I give this CD praise!!!"
4,"po russkiy, dazhe *s*","the funny thing about this album is most of the stuff IS them covering their own songs, albeit in english. i was studying russian in school, and a friend of mine pointed out their album to me (which is now in my computer, in russian *nods*). although their translations aren't anywhere near accurate, it doesn't matter, because the extra base and synth lines in the american versions are extra rocking *g*"
5,amazing,"I thought they were gonna be huge the first time i saw them. i love their cd. i cant stop listening. if you do not feel like buying the cd because you think they arnt good at least download their song ""all the things she said"". you wont regret it!!!!!!"
1,Google search for TATU and Blender magazine,"You'll find an ""interview"" with the girls that includes maybe two lines actually from the girls. Their manager is their mouthpiece, as they don't really speak english. How convenient for him, I suppose. At least he's honest, though, because he comes right out to tell you that TATU was created as a product, the theme being underage sex. No really, their manager was brazen enough to say it. Now, as to the music, it's so-so. But the whole lesbian act is just that. They don't smooch or cuddle off-camera. They're just two underage girls being paraded around in wet t-shirts and school-girl uniforms. If you want to pay for that, go ahead, but usually it gets you arrested."
1,Quick! Bring me a bag to barf in!,"If they really want so much attention why don't they just go jump off a cliff? Britney Spears already did the school-girl act, but now, making out? Who wants to watch two lesbian girls make out in the rain? Everytime I see the video I want a bag to barf in! Now, I'm not saying anything bad about lesbians, but, this is too much! The first time I saw them on MTV I thought, ""Oh look, new singers"". Then --- I saw the video. I went online to read about the interview with MTV and they said ""We aren't lesbians we just love eachother"". Ok, alright....so why are they making out?! DON'T BUY THIS CD OR ANY OTHER ONES BY T.A.T.U.!"
2,The CD is ok,"t.a.t.u is in fact the biggerst gimmick of all the time. (what there name stands for............the kissing.........the taking off of clothes.............and so on and so forth. This album is ok if you take it for what it is: a gimmicky duo of russian females who can't sing and have no real talent but have just enough voice so it can be doctored up with pro tools and placed of pop-like dance beats. If you take the album for what it is its ok but it is in no way new, different, rock or alterative and is not ""the best album ever"" like some reviewers have posted."
1,it sounds like mice being tortured,"having heard lots of positive buzz about this CD, i listened to it at borders. i quickly found myself frantically skipping through the tracks, trying to find a single one that did not make me want to egg the cars of the producers who created this monstrosity.buy the beu sisters' CD instead. you'll be glad you did. tatu = p.u."
2,The producer should have his[butt]sued,"Come on, lesbians in a video. Really. Little kids too. They were 12 when they shot it. It's one thing to use sexuality in your music to express yourself. But having them making out in the rain is utterly disgusting.But, on the MUSIC. They need to learn English. Again. They should come back when they've matured their creativity, image, and style. They sound pretty good in their russian tracks, but man, do they have to be the ultimate high-production-no substance-group to sell? Yes and NoYes, cause they haven't developed as musicians, and need to find a better company to deal with.No, cause they have potential, but must find it themselves. They shouldn't have to make out in a rain-storm to get publicity. The album leaves a bad taste in the listeners mouth, and they need to wipe it away. After they become true musicians, that is.I don't blame the duo. They aren't true musicians, and shouldn't be judged as musicians.But for Heaven's sake, what a [strange] producer!"
4,200 Km/H in the Wrong Lane,"Firstly I would like to say that the CD was catchy and fairly well written. I'm not terribly sure who is responsible for the lyrics/music though it has a nice Europop feel to it. I caught someone saying that the lyrics were deep and meaningful, don't be misguided by that, there's nothing deep about the songs. Meaningful perhaps, but I just listened to two and a half minutes of the line 'They're not gonna get us...' and while it is true that 'they' aren't going to get them, whoever they are there's nothing deep about it."
5,Great Debut!,"It was great to finally get this album here in Australia. I have the Russian version so couldnt wait to listen to this. Overall, its a great package, a bit of everything for everyone. The selection fo songs is great, nothing repetitive. The enhanced section is a good bonus, especially the Part 2 Video with the interview. All the things she said was a good choice for Single No. 1 and Not Gonna Get Us is a superb follow up. Single No.2 comes out here this week so it will great to see if a video clip is attached to the single. One of the best new acts, if not the best of 2003 so far, a fine package and a supprise that it came out of Russia! Hopefully the followup album will be just as good, if not better!"
2,average,"i really liked the song ""all the things she said"" but the rest of the album is mostly average stuff, the album would need a few more number 1 hits songs to be classified as grammy award material,this album doesn't have the capability. I wouldn't recommend buying this album unless your a fan of tatu, otherwise get the single of ""all the things she said"" instead."
5,great techno/pop album!,"This is a great album! All of the songs fit well together, and I can honestly say that there wasn't a single song I didn't enjoy. This CD ranges from techno (Not Gonna Get Us) to pop (All the Things she Said) to beautiful sadness (30 minutes) to mixtures of many elements. It is rare that a foreign artist (especially Russian!) makes a statement in the American music world, but t.A.T.u., you got it!"
2,don't believe the music hype!!,"i am a big album buyer and collector and i won't recommend buying this album because of the hype it got over ONE SONG....""all the things she said"". the album itself is not nearly as good as they say if you've listened to it. I recommend doing your research before buying cd's and listen beforehand.they have a hit song ""all the things she said"" which is fantastic no doubt but that won't make up for an average done album."
1,Kiddie porn exploitation without any musical significance,"An entirely artificial project, manufactured by their (middle-aged male) manager Ivan Shapovalov. Break into the big money western music markets by exploiting a theme that's near and dear to every (middle aged male's) heart: teenage lesbianism. The girls were simply picked for the job.Music: formulaic dance tracks, incompetent singing, banal ""gay-PC"" lyrics.Would have given 0 stars if I could.As far as introduction to modern Russian music, this one leaves everything to be desired."
2,not a lot of songs.,"i liked the cd, but it had very few songs and i really didn't care for the russian versions, i liked what they are singing i liek the lyrics but no wonder the cd is only 6.99 because it has very few songs.I think that lesbians will like this songs since they are about LEsbian Love."
5,the best CD of the year! ! !,"wow wow wow wow! i love this CD, this CD is exellent people buy this CD now!!"
5,Best CD I have ever purchased!!!,"When I usually buy CDs, there are only a few songs that i like enough to listen to and it feels like ive wasted money..All the songs on this t.a.t.u. cd are great and worth listening to over and over again. They are my favorite music group and their talent is evident on this entire album. This is a great cd for teens as well as anyone into the rock/pop scene. If you like groups who push the envelope, t.a.t.u. is the group for you!!"
4,A CD for all sexual types about LOVE,"I first heard ""All the Things She Said"" on the radio. (i must admit i thought it was 'All the Things YOU said') Before I had any clue who sang it and that they were bisexual. (yes bisexual NOT LESBIAN) It was a very adrenaline-rushed song with a lot of meaning to it, even if they didn't create the songs but who does these days? Another song I like is ""Show Me Love"". But I will confess that ""Not Gonna Get Us"" is annoyingly catchy. I recommend this CD because it is perfect to listen in the car because you get pumped up, whether your straight, bisexual or homosexual."
5,An Excellent Collection of Music,"Tatu is a controversial band thats slowly finding its way to the United States. Their first english CD is amazing. Although, i feel that their songs are more meant to be in Russian. Either way, both the Russian and the English sound great. It blows my mind how i'm enjoying the Russian tunes but surprisingly I am. Great Music can not be denied"
3,It Was Great... At First,The CD Starts Off Awesome... Then Slowly Descends Into Romantic Music About Their Love And How They Get In Fights... Then It Goes Up Again... The 2 First And Last 4 Are Great Songs... I'm Not Into That Lovey Stuff When It Comes To Pop Or Russian Techno... So It Seems Kind Of Out Of Place
3,Faux Lesbians tramps?? Whatever.,"The only thing that bothers me about T.A.T.U ""image"" its that its exploiting lesbianism. If it was real and they were putting it out there for people to see then it would be fantastic but as a marketing gimmick its sleazy. Now on to the review: I had heard ""All the things she said"" on the WB now cancelled BIRDS OF PREY and i loved it. The reason why i gave the album only three stars was because its very padded. The album has some cool moments ""not gonna get us"" rocks but Tatus high pitched voices can become very annoying. SHOW ME LOVE and CLOWNS are the two best tracks very high energy, SHOW ME LOVE also comes in a great extended version. One song i dont understand is MALCHIK GAY, are they singing it to a gay man or a straight woman??? Anyway the album also has unneccesary russian versions of NOT GONNA GET US and ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID. Overall an ok pop album if only it had more original songs instead of 8 originals, 2 russian versions and 1 extended remix. EP"
5,Russian lesbian teens - sign me up!,"I love this music and the fact that they are hot russian lesbian teens makes me like them even better! Of course ""singing russian teen lesbians"" sounds like so much spam I get these days.Anyhoo - the album is great - the Russsian language versions are very interesting. The ladies voices are high pitched but catchy -combined with pop hooks that will reel you in for sure. The backgrounds are layered, harmonic and complex - not your typical club drek.Many of the songs are addictive and will ring in your head for days after listening - particularly ""All the things she said"" running through your head, running through your head - like a hypnotic suggestion."
4,go!,"this is a great english debut and the included russian songs are even more fantastic. definitely check out, i predict they'll be huge within a few months!"
1,Half an album X 2,I bought this album and half the songs are in english and the same songs in russian. It's like buying half an album and playing it twice and paying 2 times the price. It's a rip off.
2,the stars represent a -2,"Do not waste your money buying this album, instead, spend your rubles on the original Russian version. So much of the passion and meaning is lost in translation. The Russian version lets the two express themselves the way that music should be heard. You can hear so much more in listening to the original version compared to the Americanized english version. Their level of hotness goes down when you hear the english translation, their voices are far superior in their native tongue."
3,"Since I actually am Russian, thought I'd comment...","First of all, no, they are not really lesbian, and yes, it is all a marketing ploy, and oh by the way, Ivan, their producer-manager is well-connected with the Russian mafia and is definitely not a psychologist. How do I know this? I am Russian, and I have researched Tatu quite a bit, because I listened to their music and actually liked it. Their lyrics may be repetitive in English, but they are actually quite complex in Russian. I think their music is a bit heavy on the Europop, but then, they don't orient themselves as much on Justin Timberlake, as they do on artists from Sweden, Germany and France, so, voila, different standards. Of course, they don't write their own music (does anyone these days, especially in pop music,) but they are a whole lot less obnoxious than J.Lo or Brittany Spears or the like. I say, not bad."
1,Just terrible!,"The lyrics speak for themselves. All these girls do is scream the same line over and over and OVER again until it is relentlessly ANNOYING.Here are some of the lyrics to ""Not Gonna Get Us."" The lyrics alone prove a valid point to NOT buying this terrible CD.Not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usNot gonna get usNot gonna get usThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usNot gonna get usThey're not gonna get usNot gonna get usNothing can stop this, not now I love youThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usNothing can stop this, not now I love youThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usThey're not gonna get usNot gonna get usNot gonna get usNot gonna get usNot gonna get usGet usNot gonna get us"
4,In my humble opinion...,"...they chose the WRONG Smiths song to cover. Everybody and their grandma covers ""How Soon is Now?"" It's become the ""Stairway to Heaven"" of its generation. What they SHOULD have covered was ""Sheila Take a Bow,"" a sweet li'l ol' courtship song for androgynes of uncertain sexual persuasion. For a bonus, Yulia Volkova (The Noisy One) could cover ""Bigmouth Strikes Again!"" ;-)It's a shame the act is self-destructing. Under better management, and more jovial songs to balance out the ""I'd DIE without you!"" theme off the album, they could have been a cooler version of the Village People. They'd have been the toast of the club circuit! Unfortunately, their manager was an eejit.Now if I was managing that act, I'd have them do a disco-opera about Original Gangsta Lesbian Poetess Sappho! (Bulb lights up! Me Am Hulk starts writing the libretto...)"
5,Something I can sit and listen to or get up and dance to.,"I found it to be a great mix of music. I also came to find out from a foreign exchange student from Russia that the translation to ""Ya Soshla S Uma"" is actually ""I Have Lot My Mind."" And as he translated the rest of the Russian song, it turned out to be nothing like the English sung in ""All The Things She Said."" The words ""mne nuzha ona, mne nuzha ona"" spoken between the opening ""ya soshla s uma"" is translated to ""I need her, I need her."" I'm not sure what to think of the rest of the translation. But, overall, I very much like the music."
2,Not Meant To Last,"The young Russian duo are great to look at, but they haven't develop their real talent yet (play instruments, write their own songs, dance, etc). Nothing really seem to be produced by them. Sure, they may have the screechy voices which can be made to sound better with some enhancement of the computer (Examples: check out ""Malchik Gay"" (a very wimpy song) and the video ""All the Things She Said"" (the lyrics go before their mouth are running). Just like puppets, there's someone behind them controlling every movement. Everything is previously set up in this album without any effort from themselves. Another trend, similar to those boy/girl bands. First making to the top then falling to the bottom. Can they really survive without the gimmicks? Where will they be in five years? I have an awful feeling T.A.T.U will fade in a matter of time."
4,A great CD,"Many people have expressed disgust over the fact the two female members that comprise T.A.T.U. are not actually lesbians, but rather part of a clever marketing gimmick to sell CDs. It's even doubtful that they write their own songs. Yet upon listening to it, you can't help but be sucked in, by the catchy tunes and the two singer's great voices (which again, may not be entirely their own). In all this possible fakeness, how can I recommend this CD? Suppose a world famous chef served you a bowl of fettucine alfredo, telling you he made it himself. You take a bite; it's the best bite of the pasta you've ever had! You eagerly finish off the bowl, only to have the chef tell you that he lied, and that it was actually just a TV dinner. That still doesn't change the fact that it was really good."
5,Amazing and uplifting...,"Personally, this album has been on heavy rotation in my CD player since the day it was released. I love it! It gets me in the mood to get up and get going! Its perfect to listen to while working out or cleaning the house. The girls voices are amazing and reach even more amazing highs. If you pass up this album you are sure to regret it!"
4,just what I was looking for,"I have a 95 Astro van that I use for work, loaded down with tools and need support these worked good. Necessary info 7 1/2"" tall by 3 1/4"" wide inside dimension. are bigger than they look. Good for the job."
2,Didn't fit,"The box was torn up when it arrived. It looked like it had been opened and then sent back. The""U"" bolts would'nt even go around the differental. and the instructions are useless."
3,OK for the money,"For the price these are hard to beat. Does increase the load carrying ability of my station wagon and helps keep the tail end from dragging when I have a trailer hooked up. If I had to do it again though I would get the air bags for my car, they are more money, $80.00, but you can deflate them when not needed, the springs give me a stiff bouncey ride all the time now when not loaded down."
4,A great introduction for kids,"I first saw this movie when I was 6 or 7, and I've always loved it. It was my introduction to fantasy, and led to my great interest in the genre. If you compare this movie to the book, it's almost a joke, I guess, but I do think that Gollum, Gandalf, and Smaug were very well done. It portrays the *essence* of the book to children very well(the songs are fantastic!). I think the last scene with Thorin and Bilbo was also well done, and very true to the book. So no matter what its flaws as an adaptation, I'll always have a special place in my heart for this film. Very worthwhile as a child's introduction into a fantastic and worthwhile genre."
3,"Of course it isn't as good as the Book, but.....","The hobbit was one of my favorite books since a very young age. When I first saw the movie, I thought it was great. I probably watched it a hundred times. However, as I got older I viewed it more critically and it wasn't as accurate as I would have liked. It is still a great movie though."
3,"Not the book, but an OK condensation","Fanatical Tolkien fans will surely be disappointed by The Hobbit, but it's not bad for what it is: a child-oriented musical adaptation. The movie condenses the books plot down to the bare bones, and yes, I did spend a lot of my viewing time thinking ""But what about...."". A lot is left out, but what is left in works well, and the story moves along briskly. The voice work is OK; nothing special, and the animation is decent.The DVD itself is pretty bare-bones- the movie, a few (brief) text features, chapter headings, and that's it. It's not a bad way to pass a few hours, especially for a nostalgic fan (like myself....) who hasn't seen it since the original CBS airing in 1977. (I liked it better when I was six...)I would definitely recommend it for younger viewers, and it's a great way for parents to get their kids interested in reading; an interested child might want to move on to the books."
3,A pretty good adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece,"This animated version of Tolkien's 'The Hobbit,' along with the other two films of Bakshi's trilogy, stays pretty faithful to the book on which it was based. There are parts missing, of course, but that is to be expected with any screen adaptation. The voices are great, and the music (by Glenn Yarbrough) is tolerable, although very dated. In fact, this is one of the chief defects of the movie--the dialogue is very dated. You can only tolerate hearing Bilbo or a dwarf say ""Bless my Soul!"" so many times.Overall, though, this is a pretty good film. The animation is not great (Smaug has the face of a cat), but is tolerable for the time in which it was made. Again, there are no technological marvels here, just a good, well-told story. This movie isn't perfect, but it will do until a newer version of 'The Hobbit' comes along."
5,Still Worth It,"I remember seeing this when it was first broadcast....and fell in love with it. The characters, the music...just so enjoyable. So I purchased the vinyl record set(which I still have), then this video. I still have the VHS tape and I guess I will hold onto it, as I see from reading other reviews that the DVD release is no good. Hopefully that will change one day. Till then, the tape is, as I said, still worth it!"
3,Its interesting,"I really think that it was great that they made an attempt at bringing the classic tale to the screen. I just got my D.V.D. of it today and watched it. One thing I missed - one thing that is in the book, but not in the movie - was that Beorn wasn't in it, neither was the Arkenstone. Most of the music is good enough, but while I liked the trolls and spiders, I did NOT like the goblins nor the elves (with the exception of Elrond and his huge 'crown'). Sméagol-Gollum's voice was also done well enough.It is quite short - 78 minutes - but I Do like it, and I think Rankin & Bass did their job quite well.I would recommend Ralph Bakshi's L.O.T.R., as well, though."
5,great movie,"This is a great movie, but only one thing would make it better: THEY NEED TO MAKE A SOUNDTRACK CD!!!!! Some songs, like the Elves' ""Tra-la-la-lalley"", the Wood-elves ""Rollin' Down the Hole"", and the Dwarves' ""Far O'er the Misty Mountains Cold"" are being talked over by characters. Sondtracks make movies better."
1,Why didn't they just give us the original movie?,"There's lot's of problems with this DVD. First of all, they've added some kind of bloom effect that makes everything look glowy. I assume this was to make look new and shiny but it also makes everything look especially dark. You can hardly see the Riddles in the Dark scene because it's so dark!Then there are random edits throughout the entire movie. At the very beginning, the video stops and the frame literally spins around the screen. Why? And there's tons of skips and cuts and audio missing throughout the rest of the movie. Why did they find it necessary to add this stuff? It's like they didn't even watch it and realize how bad it is before they released it. It sucks too because this is the only DVD version I can find that isn't 99 bucks. You're better off finding a download or VHS copy."
3,For a while this was it,"For years, this was the ONLY movie rendition of my favorite book. This animated feature is a halfway decent adaptation of the book to a movie. Some of the characters look good in animation, such as the Dwarves and Elves. Others look silly, like the Goblins and poor Bilbo, who looks like a female rabbit-person (although, honestly this probably fits the description of him in the book better than Peter Jackson's humanoid Hobbits). For me the biggest failing of this movie was the voices. None of the voice actors left an indelible impression on the characters, in contrast to the BBC radio adaptation of the Hobbit, which really solidified the voices of Throrin and Smaug for me. Also, for an animated movie, the special effects are pretty dated, more like a moving illustration than a movie. All I can say is that I'm thankful Peter Jackson is making the Hobbit movies."
3,dated but respectful animated adaptation of Tolkien classic,"In watching any of Ralph Bakshi's animated trilogy of Tolkien's classics you can see that the team who worked on them had real affection and respect for the books. But there's no arguing that technology has come a lo-o-o-o-o-ong way since then. Long and frequent songs, on the other hand, are faithful to the spirit of the books but are really too dated to be entertaining. The movie's voice talent is superb -- Orson Bean as Bilbo, Richard Boone as Smaug, John Huston as Gandalf, Hans Conried as Thorin and Otto Preminger as the Elvenking. Romeo Muller's script is loyal to the book though some arcs, such as the visit with Beorn, are omitted.Special features are not spectacular: cast and crew credits, Tolkien facts and trivia, and hobbit facts. Subtitles are in English, French or Spanish."
1,didn't see it yet but not buying it,"It is not fair to call this a ""review"" because I have not watched the DVD. Due to having seen several reviews here and on other websites regarding the lack of good audio and the sadly recrafted movie, I refuse to buy it. I LOVE The Hobbit from my childhood. I have been searching for months for the movie in DVD for my kids and after reading several reviews, I know myself well enough to choose to avoid the deep disappointment that others have related about this particular DVD. I just want the same movie I watched as a kid on a DVD. Is that too much to ask?"
3,The Hobbit's DVD,"First off I would like to say this is an excellent movie. It follows the book very well except it did cut out a few parts which were in the book. The only thing I found wrong with this adaptation of Tolkiens masterpiece is that they added horrible songs (Which were not in the book) that will be stuck in your head for hours. They did an excellent job casting the voice artists in this movie. Now, for the DVD. WB didn't do a very good job on this DVD . First of all there were barely any extras on this DVD except for lists of cast and crew and a few facts about the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. The worst part of the DVD is that at some points in the movie all of the sound goes away for a few seconds except for the background music. Even though this DVD has problems its still a great DVD. If you are a fan of the book or if your looking for an adventure this DVD is a must have."
1,A valiant effort and miserable failure,"It's been a long time since I attempted to watch this [film], but not long enough. The author is certainly entitled to his own interpretation, but unless it's a vaguely entertaining one I really wish he wouldn't try to foist it off on others. This movie just plain [is not good] -- annoying animation, obnoxious voices, and worst of all, a complete butchering of the spirit of the book."
4,Thought-Provoking,"I first saw this movie when i was very little, and many of the parts scared me. For example the scenes where Bilbo and the team of dwarves are being chased by the goblins in the caves, and especially Gollum's scene. I just pick up the movie again when i realized how often my younger brother was watching, and i coudln't STOP watching it. Theg raphics are pretty darn good, and I imagine the story line and scri[pt are as close to the original book as one might get. The Hobbit isn't part of the original Lord of the Rings Series, and I have yet to read the Hobbit. However, i have read all three Lord of the Rings books and found them enticing...."
3,This was a good movie,"This was a good movie, but there were a few problems. When I saw the Hobbit in DVD, I noticed that they took out most of the sound effects. why? I don't really know, and I thought if I got the VHS it would be better. but I was a little hard to see the picture because of the different colors. I'll just have to accept the DVD and deal with no sound effects. but the movie was still good anyway."
5,Wonderful Movie,"I grew up reading The Hobbit and always enjoyed the movie as well, so I couldn't resist upgrading my old VHS tape to a DVD. I highly recommend this movie!"
4,Great!,"If you love the Hobbit, it is not a guarantee that will like this movie. There are a few key plot lines from the book missing here. But, this is a great adaptation of the beloved classic. If you are looking for some nostalgia this is for you. But be warned, it may not be as good as you remembered it."
3,HOBBIT video: the older one,"As a shortened version of the book, this video does a good job. It just didn't appeal to my audience: 7th graders in my English Language Arts class. I am glad to see the more adult film will be opening at theaters soon and should be available for purchase fairly soon. If your audience is young, this would be a good introduction to the fantasy genre."
5,Kids loved when little,"Ordered these movies to give to my kids on their birthdays. They are now 30 yrs plus but watched this movie all the time when little munchkins and has lead to them being very interested in The Lord of the Rings series not only movies but books as well. Seller had the best price I could find, we're the original movies like I wanted and would definitely order from again.Thanks"
1,Not a quality recording,"I was happy enough to get a DVD copy of this even if it was just a straight VHS rip, but my VHS copy is actually better. The sound and video quality are sub-par. There are moments where awkward video transitions are inserted as if there were cuts in the available print and in places the scene skips or repeats itself for a second. I would not recommend this to anyone. Until someone gets around to doing this movie justice with a real blu-ray, you're better off just holding on to a VHS copy."
4,Wonderful Story,"Watched this when I was young and still enjoy the music. The quality could be better, but hey, it's an OLD movie!"
5,Audio problems did not make me not Enjoy the film.,Problem with the audio so be warned. But the Magic of this film is still there. The audio may be a problem for some but I think it is worth it so such a low cost.
2,The Hobbit,the movie is of very poor quality. My daughter wanted to share a favorite movie from her childhood with her own boys. very disappointed.
3,really fun,I really enjoyed The Hobbit years ago and just as much now. It hits the right high points. Hope we get a live action version of it.
5,Great intro to LOTR,"I had this cartoon as a child and I always loved it. I bought the DVD for my kids and they also love it. I noticed some of the sound effects missing or different, and naturally, Rankin-Bass's take on Tolkien's world is not Peter Jackson's. But even Peter Jackson would admit that Peter Jackson's take isn't Tolkien's either. All in all, I think it is a good introduction to Middlearth for the younger generation who may be just developing a love of ""dwarves, goblins, wizards, dragons and hobbits..."""
3,Good Introduction For Kids But Not Great,"In all honesty this is a very good movie. The problem is that the book is rather dark for children. So it would be rather difficult to do a cartoon movie adaptation. However, having said that. The movie isn't so bad. I think it is a good classic for kids and a nice way to introduce the author to kids."
2,The Hobbit: Animated (dvd),"I was looking forward to watching this animated version, as i havent read the book. I was expecting it to be like the original Lord Of The Rings animated classic... but was dissapointed by a few things. Firstly the animation is aimed at younger children of about 2-5 years old. The songs are really really annoying & too american style, as well as american accents which, i feel spoil it. The atmosphere is great & the backdrops wonderfull. As well as some really beautifull effects....The main thing i hate is that Golem looks more like a frog than how he is supposed to look.It great to see The Hobbit on dvd, but i prefer to watch it with the sound OFF.Why didnt they just make this & ""the return of the king"" amimation, the same as the original? or mabe just tweak it slightly here & there?visualy impressive, but a sonic failure."
2,Nightmares,"I saw this when I was a kid and after seeing the NEW LOTR...found a renewed interest in The Hobbit. So re-rented it and immediately wished I hadn't. No, I haven't read the books yet, but I intend to. However, that doesn't excuse how gross this cartoon is. As a child it scared the (insert expletive here) outta me and today it still does. The only interesting character is our heroic wizard and sometimes I wished that he'd just zap Baggins right off the screen for good. The film really didn't delve into any depths the book, I believe, touches on...and I was left with questions...lots-o-them. So, I guess for real entertainment I should read the trilogy from Tolkien, ... ."
1,Dreadful,"The one word that sums this movie up is dreadful. I love the story, but the little Nazi-style elves sprouting leaves are just one example of how this interpretation went wrong. With only one exception (The Return of the King, also by Rankin -Bass) it is it is the worst adaptation of Tolkien's works that I have ever seen."
1,dont buy,horribel its a copy of the origanal and it is so dark that you can hardly see ant thing that is going on
3,did not transfer to dvd well,i love this movie it was my favorit as a kid. the only problum here is that the dark sceans did not transfer to dvd well and are at somepoints not much more then a black screen with audio.
1,Bad recording,"I was very disappointed in this recorded version of the classic animated Hobbit. It was poorly recorded.. it skipped in several places, even cut out some of the Dialog and lyric from the Bard singing. Or it would repeat itself like a scratch on a record player would or a scratch on a Music CD. Which is very strange for a DVD that is BRAND NEW and w/o a mark on it's playing surface. Plus the dark scenes (which was most of the movie) was so dark you couldn't see anything.I would be better off finding me a VHS player and watching mu VHS copy.. or find a place that would be willing to tranfer it to DVD format.DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. Don't waist your time."
1,Bad quality!,"This movie was cheaply converted to dvd. The colors are too dark and it skips a couple times. I cant even get it to look decent after messing with the picture options on my plasma tv. Every other dvd or blu ray that I own works fine in my player, so the problem is definitely the dvd."
1,Not the best version for this classic.,"This transfer feels so incomplete compared to the version I used to watch throughout my childhood. This version is choppy, with random bits skipping parts of dialogue and on loop. The worst part of this DVD is the coloring, which is horrible. The contrast is FAR too dark and this causes the scenes to become lost and, more often than not, you end up watching a pitch black screen and wondering if it's your computer or DVD player. It ISN'T. It's the DVD. Brand new or not, it is not worth the ten dollars you would spend for it."
2,Beware Krappy video-ness,"The story is a classic one and is protrayed pretty well story wise. The problem is that the characters are freakishly non-human looking (not that kids would mind, i liked it then). Also, this movie was made in the 1970's and they haven't made any effort to fix up the old film, so it looks like a bootleg; seriously! JUST BEWARE QUALITY."
2,over-whelmed with a sense of its own importance,"seeing this film successfully kept me from reading anything by tolkien for over ten years. after i had read ""the hobbit,"" i was able to watch it and laugh more often than i felt appaled.the film lacks the quiet dignity of the book and feels heavy-handed. watching it i could only think of the phrase, ""bilbo gump."" the progress the character of bilbo makes in the book is lost in film and we are left with a hero who wanders through his various adventures, which apparently have very little effect on anything aside from his financial situation. and as an extra side-note, the music feels ridiculous."
1,Drained of emotion,"As many have said, this version of the film is inferior to it's earlier incarnations. I've watched this film on TV and VHS since I was a child. I've loved it ever since and never got tired of it.I was SO disappointed in the Warner's DVD release. Half the music is subdued. And worse, half the sound effects are missing. The clanging of swords. The screech of the Eagles. The sound of Sting slicing up Spiders. The sound of Glamdring cutting down Goblins. Many more. All gone. They even cut bits of dialog. At one point, Bilbo looks like he's just talking to himself because the off camera dialog is gone.The movie has been rendered dead and lacks of emotion. I hope they correct this with a future release. H3ll, if nothing else, they could just get the Laser disc (remember those? *heh-heh*) and rip the soundtrack from that. Anything is better than this, Warner. You're an old company. You know better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!,"I have grown up with this story of The Hobbit, its one of my favorites. I have always had this movie in my collection and know the lines by heart. I have bought this DVD and the DVD stinks! Warner Brothers ruined this story on DVD. How? The sound was re-mastered for the DVD and there are sound effects MISSING! They used an old copy of the soundtrack that was used on a four record set that issued in 1978. If you want the complete soundtrack I recomend you buy the VHS tape. (The older the copy the better) They have also added new sound effects and lines that are NOT in the the original soundtrack! There are also problems with their DVD's of The Lord of the Rings and The Return of the King. (See my reviews for those DVDs under there listings) If Waner Brothers really cares they will re-issue These 3 DVDs after correcting their problems. ~Rob~"
1,"Great Video, Lousy Reproduction","This vendor's edition is washed out, grainy, and missing snippets. It looks like a bad copy from a TV broadcast. If you want to enjoy this wonderful video, buy the version from Warner Bros. Classic Tales. It is the same production reproduced properly. I'm going to see whether I can return this version for the good one."
1,MOIVES ON PARADE! DO NOT ORDER-ITS WORST COPY OF HOBBIT,"I have seen this moive over 1000 times and thats no exageration! being born in 1972 I remember this film in the theatres and has been a favorite ever since and is a FAMILY FAVORITE with my kids today.This ""THE HOBBIT:THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED 1977 ANIMATED CLASSIC"" as advertised it a complete lie, the film is edited and missing scences,not whole scences mind but enough to make it seem it was chopped to be compadible for T.V. and its commercials to fit in a time slot, not only that the colar is quite faded and not sure if it is due to a poor quality DVD that the moive was downloaded/recorded on but there is a glich, a repeator skip of 1.5 second as Bilbo spaeks to Gandalf and others....I will never order on Amazon again, HOW CAN THEY CALL IT THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED CLASSIC WHEN IT IS NOT!SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THE REAL VERSION!!!"
1,Tape was broken,I bought this tape and it did not even get through one viewing without it being eaten as it was obviously very worn.
4,dark copy,I remember this movie well and am very excited to have it in my collection. That being said this copy is very dark. It was difficult to see what was going on in some instances.
3,Great show bad sound,"I love the show, always have. Saw it when I was in elementary school many years ago on reel-to-reel. I also own the original tape I bought from a rental store that was getting rid of it. The picture quality of the DVD is awesome but the sound is bad. In many scenes, like when Bilbo fights the spiders or when he confronts Smog, certain background sounds are missing. In the VHS version as Bilbo stabs a spider there is a magic-like sound accompanying the swirl of light as the spider dies. But in the DVD there is only the swirl of light. Also, when Smog is diving on Lake Town his flame is suppose to have a sound as it hits. The only sound there is a light crackle in the backgorund. When the Eagles dive there is no sound on the DVD either but there is on the VHS. I guess I'm just saying, the sound transfer to DVD was messed up by whoever did it."
4,Good Movie for Kids and Adults Alike!,"This is a very good animated movie, with quality animation and clever songs. In fact, the songs are one of the best parts, and they're quite catchy. This is a basic telling of The Hobbit, the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. One thing to note, this movie's sequel is NOT the animated Lord of the Rings, it is ""Return of the King."" The directors and animators who did this movie and ""Return of the King"" never made the movie to fill the gap between the two."
2,Okay... If you're not a Tolkien purist,"unfortunately, I am.I would have really liked this movie a lot more if I hadn't read the book first. Bilbo was nothing like I had pictured him. In fact Gandalf was the only one who was! Gollum looked like a giant, starved frog. Smaug's head looked like a giant cat's. They cut out Beorn completely. I really liked him.I did like the part where at the beginning of the war, the people who were fighting each other 5 minutes earlier were saying that they loved each other ""Like brothers!""But besides that, it tried to hard to stick to the book, losing the essence.It is great for little kids who want to see the ""big person"" Lord of the Rings, but it is too sacary for them."
