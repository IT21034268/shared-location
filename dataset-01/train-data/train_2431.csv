1,unusable,bought 3 and none worked..the price to return them will cost half of my refund ...they now are going to the landfill ..
1,Does Not Work with Video on Computer,I purchased this item with the sole intent of hooking up my computer to my television. I ran the wire through the wall went to plug it in and got audio only. No video signal. Tried a shorter cord and it works. Returning this item.
1,lightweight,I hooked up a roku player in the other bedroom on the cable about 15 feet away and the cable quit working in a week. Guess one of the wires burned into because of the hd signal.
1,Stopped working,"We had got this put in our home theater room, just recently connected a projector to it. It worked the first two days, but stopped working after that. We were mounting the projector to the ceiling so had to remove the cable/put it back a few times. Seems flimsy."
2,You will be lucky if they work,I ordered a couple and received some that didn't work. The company was good about sending replacements but one worked and one didn't. Looks like these are pretty bad quality.
1,Did not work at all,"The cable arrived in good condition and appeared to be of good quality. However, it did not transmit any signal at all. I understand that a HDMI cable of this length can be problematic, and it certainly was for me. I tried it with two different devices with no success. When I used a shorter cable, there was no problem."
5,works fine,Connected computer to HDTV and it looks great streaming Netflicks. Don't pay 100's of dollores.
5,Excellent purchase!,"Received the HDMI to HDMI 25' cable. Much better quality than I expected, worked great from my HDTV to my computer."
5,"works , cheap","Works and its cheap , I have gotten 5 of these so far , none have failed , very long , cant be beat , signal looks great why waste money on more expensive cables ?"
1,Do not buy from importer520,"I bought this same exact cable from a different company in August and it was great. Just bought this one from seller importer520, and the cable was more thin, flimsier and could not create a stable connection. The cable fits loosely in the hdmi port of my computer, TV and my female-to-female extender connector. When connected it makes beautiful rainbows all over my screen with rave-like flickering. As awesome as that is, this is not what anyone wants from an HDMI cable."
1,very poor quality,this hdmi cable is of terrible quality. the picture shows up with grainy green pixels everywhere. when i hook up the monitor with my old VGA cable instead the picture is perfect.
1,"PRODUCT IS A SCAM, TOTAL GARBAGE",I bought two of these 25 foot cables only to snake them through my wall (so that all wires are hidden and go to the entertainment center) neither of the cables worked and actually when I hooked one of the cables up to my blu-ray player and then to my HD TV it blew the port and now does not work. I contacted the seller only to get an e-mail that said it's not their problem and to contact Amazon. GARBAGE!!!! I usually have no problem on Amazon but I guess there are exceptions to the rules so to speak.
1,link depot 25ft hdmi cable,"How can you beat $6.80 for a 25ft hdmi cable. Well, you get what you pay for. This cable was basically DOA. I hooked it up to my xbox360, PS3, Blu-ray player, LG wireless media player, desktop PC, and Macbook pro. The result was the same every time. A Black screen, or black and red, with some image from the device that was very garbled with lines. Maybe I just got a bad cable. I'm kind of apprehensive of trying again. The plan was to use this cable with my laptop in a karaoke setup situation. Currently with my 6 foot cable, I have to sit close to the TV while running karaoke."
1,Too good to be true,"after being quoted $250 for a 25ft. HDMI cable from Best Buy, I was cautiously optimistic to find one for $13 here on Amazon. Of course it was too good to be true....no audio signal sent between my cable box and TV and the picture quality was spotty at best. Return to sender."
5,Works great for my PC <-> HDTV connection,"I use this cable to connect my laptop to the TV when I'm sitting on the couch. Picture looks very clear on my 46"" HDTV. Build quality seems very sturdy."
4,Decent,"It was very cheap, shipped for free, and works the way you want it to. My only issue with this wire is the delay that is caused by such a long wire. Whether it is an issue of the wire itself or just the length is beyond my expertise, but if you really need 25 feet, get this cable."
5,Can't beat the price,"Great buy! A little thin, but doesn't hurt the quality. Of coures with with HDMI cables you can spend $100 on thicker ones, and your still gonna get the same quality picture!"
2,HDMI cable,The cable is plenty long but the quality of the video sent to my tv is not so great. I have red lines when screen shows black anywhere. This is very distracting and wish I had sent it back within the return policy but forgot.
3,"Peformance good, quality suspect","I got this cable from IDIGIMART(now appears to be called importer520). The picture quality I get when using it seems to be fine; but after only a few months of use, the cable around one of the connectors seems to be coming apart. It's still working ok, but am concerned about the longevity of the product."
3,CABLE QUALITY,CABLE PRETTY THIN COMPARED TO PREVIOUS CABLES PURCHASED FROM OTHER COMPANIES. BUT IT WILL WORK FOR THE DVD PLAYER. NO PROBLEMS.
4,decent item,the signal strength is a little weak - being a 25ft long cable. But otherwise good construction cable... was able to successfully connect laptop to TV and cable box to TV. did not try any fancy pancy stuff - but it works :-)
2,Doesn't work anymore,"This product worked just fine when I got it. Unfortunately, it no longer works. The problem is the cord, as my many other HDMI cords still accomplish the same task with no issues. When I use this cord, the image is distorted and sometimes neon green. I suppose this is just a cheap product, which is great when you buy it, but not so great when it breaks."
2,You get what you pay for . . .,"I've ordered many ""budget"" hdmi cables and never had a problem with any of them, so I ordered this without any concerns. This is the first time I've ordered a cable longer than 6 feet (used to connect a receiver to a 1080p projector). Unfortunately the cable is not suitable for my needs. The image had a lot of noise (red snow-like interference all over the projected image) and was not clear enough. I tested with a different hdmi cable and the image from the projector was flawless. I'd advise spending a few more bucks on a higher quality cable.Note: I did test this cable directly into the projector from my PS3, and the red snow was diminished from the extreme amount displayed when passed through my A/V receiver, however, it was still present."
4,25 foot HDMI,"I initially thought that this product was not working, but realized that the dvd/blueray player, or whatever source you use, has to be in ""play"" mode. Product works just fine...I use it for a projector that has HDMI and picture looks great.."
2,It worked while it lasted,"The cable is cheap... It worked, but one day I pulled out my tower to do some work, forgot to unplug the HDMI cable, and it somehow tore off the end and bent all the pins (Then two of the pins snapped off when I tried to bend them back). I ended up replacing with a cable from China that was all wrapped up in a nice mesh fabric and had strong, sturdy ends."
3,wertgyuijo,i order this and i got a 8 ft one when i asked what happen they sent me a 25ft one they are good now
4,quick and easy,it came a couple days later than it was supposed to but it was still a painless process. i recommend them.
3,"Great picture, cheap build quality","Produced an excellent picture quality but the tip snapped off with very little force while I was moving cables around behind the TV. The cable is now useless. I have since reordered this exact cable and just have to keep the lower quality in mind next time I'm handling the cable. That being said, I have, and would buy it again, but only for a lack of a better option."
4,HDMI Cable,The cable is working great. Only thing bad about it is that it's too thick and the black coding around the cable is not very attractive.
4,Good buy!,"I received the 25Ft HDMI cable yesterday and within a few minutes everything was connected and working just fine.I still don't understand how or why someone would pay $99+ for cables when they can be purchased online for a decimal of the cost, so thanks online sellers for charging fair prices."
1,DEFECTIVE CABLE!!! *** BUYER BEWARE ***,"I bought this defective HDMI cable to connect a laptop to my new LCD HDTV. This cable started having problems on the 2nd day!!! While playing World of Warcraft or watching You Tube videos, I noticed several red lines across the screen along with mysterious shades of green on black and white colors. The overall picture is also pixelated, distorted, has interference ""snow,"" & this cable successfully makes my new 42"" 1080p LCD screen appear like an old Cathode Ray TV connected by an antenna. I contacted the merchant for a replacement and have not heard anything. DO NOT BUY THIS CABLE!!! This was a waste of money. I will never buy from this merchant again, nor will I recommend this company. This HDMI cable needs to be recalled ASAP."
1,Poor Quality Cable,"I purchased this cable in the hopes that it would live up to its claims. all of the devices i tried to connect with it came with dreaded green lines. the cable itself is thin and feels a little cheap, for the price I paid, its possible i got a bad cable, or that it just isnt up to snuff. I will be buying another brand even if it means slightly more money out of pocket..."
1,patrick,"This HDMI cable was absolute junk, no sound and fuzzy picture. replaced it with one bought at radio shack much more expensive and everything was perfect! I won't bother to return the cable because the shipping and my time makes it a no brainer!"
1,Blue dots ..,i bought this cheap hdmi for my computer to my tv.. it is not hd quality its has like lil blue dots or lines on the screen when i hook it up.. gonna see if i can send it back
1,Does not work properly,"The length seems to be right on. If the cable worked properly it would have been a great purchase. However, the reception is terrible. I tested the tv and bluray with other cables I have and they worked fine. The problem is with this cable."
2,end pins came out,"I have used many short length HDMI cables, This Cable's (25 ft) end pins just came out when I pulled from Projector slot...Poor mold. I ordered another one from Amazon."
2,snowy,The cable doesn't work too well. The image is coming over snowy on the TV. I don't know if the length of the cable is causing this snowy effect or just the quality of the cable. I have ready that the length on HDMI cable doesn't matter. I wouldn't recommend to anyone.
2,Bought 5 and 1 broke after 2 weeks,"I bought five of these cables and one stopped working after 2 weeks. It works intermittently if you wiggle the cable. Considering the price, a 20% failure rate might not be all that bad. You just need to purchase extra cables to account for the failure rate, then when it does fail, you will not be so disappointed."
5,Good item at a low price,"I have 2 of those, one to connect the computer to the AV amplifier and another one from the amplifier to the video projector. I can't tell the difference with shorter or more expensive cables even in full HD (1080p).So don't bother looking for more expensive cables, this is the cheapest you can find for a cable of this length while not compromising quality."
1,Sad,Worked for a couple of months and then failed. Bought from Importer 520. Shipped in paper-thin plastic film envelope. Do not buy.
1,Stopped working after 2 months,"That's it, it would not work anymore. Waste of money. Now I need to buy a new one. Word of advice - buy from a reputable brand."
1,Link Depot HDMI Cable,"Weeks of anticipated excitement completely wasted. I thought a $7, 25 foot HDMI cable sounded scetchy, I should've listened to my thoughts. The first one I ordered arrived in about a week, I ran inside and tried it out, picture and sound came through for about 30 seconds and then cut out, a second later they came back on but that lasted for another 30 seconds and cut out again, that pretty much is the way the first cable functioned. After filing a return claim, I received an email stating that the company would simply ship me a new cable free of charge but that they have NO RETURN POLICY. I waited another two weeks and got my new and unimproved HDMI cable. This one is worse than the first, it simply does not work. I plan on emailing the company back but I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT NO ONE WASTE THEIR TIME OR MONEY ON THESE CABLES."
1,STAY FAR AWAY!!!!,Don't learn the hard way like I did. I mounted my TV and ran these cables through the wall only to find out there pure junk. Static and lines all over the screen. Switched to a higher grade cable for $10 more and it works perfect. Its worth it to spend the extra $10 with HDMI cable of this length. These are TOO cheap to be any good.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Just recieved the cable. I just give one star because it arrived on time.. If not I would give it a minus. This was a complete waste of my money and time. The connector broke immediately i tried connecting it. Just like that.. lost my money. I should have bought a more expensive one. Don't waste your time, the cable is cheap quality and too weak. I hope this helps."
1,connector fell apart after a year,I unplug and plug in the connector to the laptop often. After a year it fell apart. The gold wrapper fell off leaving all the little exposed wire ends open.
1,Broke after one plugin-out,"Stay away from this cheap piece of connector. not worth it! I plugged this in to my brand new HD TV. After a month I bought a streaming player and wanted to switch connections. Pulled the wire out, it came out in 2-pieces. Lesson learned."
1,THESE CABLE AR HORRIBLE,SO MUCH INTERFERENCE. I BOUGHT ONE SET AND THEY SUCKED AND BROKE RIGHT AWAY. I ORDERED A 2ND PAIR THINKING IT WAS A DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER I WAS WRONG!!!!. I DONT KNOW WHO IS SAYING THESE THINGS ARE GREAT THEY ARE LYING DO NOT BUY ITS NOT EVENWOTH THE 5 OR 6 BUX
1,Bait and switch!,"I purchased 6 25' HDMI cables from Amazon and was astounded by their quality and low price. So much so, that I placed a second order for 4 more 25' cables and 2 40'ers. Imagine my surprise when, after several hours swetting in my South Carolina attic, these new cables failed to work. Upon closer inspection and comparing to the first set of cables, I found that the second lot were much thinner and the packaging said 'Made in China', where the first lot had not. It turns out that the first order had been filled by INTERNATIONAL GLOBAL VENTURES, where the second order was from CABLE-MIX. Now, in all fairness to Amazon, the 40' cables were of simular quality to the original 25'ers, so maybe they simply can't ensure the quality of items from their suppliers. In any case, it sure feels like I got the old 'bait-and-switch' from Amazon. I will not buy from them again."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this cable to connect my HDTV to my laptop. The product was in visibly good condition, but doesn't work at all. I tested my setup with other shorter, higher quality hdmi cables, and they all work fine.From reading previous reviews, it seems that some of the cables are defective, and the ones that do work decay after repeated use.Don't waste your money. Put it into a higher quality cable."
5,If you need a long cable this one works,I recomend this product because it supports 1080 between DVD player recorder and the TV coming out ofa Kinivo HS420 Premium 4*2-Four Inputs to Two Outputs solved all my problems
1,horrible,"This makes the TV look so grainy. The chord is very long, but it doesn't make sense having it, my TV is HD and this chord makes it look as if its not!!"
2,Fragile cable,"Like many other reviews here, my cable worked fine until I unpluged it. I felt something ""pop"". The metal shield has one solder spot, and when you slighly bend when unplugging, you break the solder connection.I didn't know until I took it apart so far that I couldn't easily get back together.If I would have known I might could have repaired the broken solder point. Don't pull the metal housing off or like me, you may never get it back on.Watch out too, some of the ""better"" HDMI cables are for computer, not TV/DVD."
2,3 of 4 worked fine,"I bought 4, but only 3 worked. I would suggest you either buy extras or spend your money elsewhere. The failed cable didn't transmit audio and one color, likely a manufacturing defect."
5,This is all you need! Link Depot is the only way to go!,"I paid $30 for a 6ft Vizio HDMI cable at Walmart before finding the Link Depot cables. First I picked up a 6ft, found out how well it works and bought two more. Also picked up the 25ft to use for connecting the laptop to the TV and it's fantastic. I use them for Tivo, Blu-ray, gaming, and the laptop and the Link Depot cables work perfect for these applications. My son had just paid $70 at Best Buy for an 8ft HDMI cable for his new Xbox and I gave him one of these 6ft Link Depot cables and he promptly returned the overpriced ones. Buy these...you won't be disappointed!"
5,Great buy,"WOW! I was so happy when I found this on Amazon for the price! I needed this to stream movies from my pc to my big screen tv. In store the cheapest option was $40, this really is a great buy and the cable works perfectly!"
3,HDMI,The wire is thinner than normal quality wire. It seems to work for my TV but I don't know if the thinner wire will adversely affect other data transfers.
3,Works for low quality; flickers at 1080p though,"I'm not sure if its something universal to long HDMI cables. I bought it to video out from my laptop to my TV. It works video outing YouTube through my ipad/iphone just fine. However, signal flickers on my TV when I push to 1080p signals. I've tested with shorter length cables, so I know the video out is fine, I could just be wishing that 25ft is viable and may not be for cheaper quality cables. Otherwise, shipping came fast and it was exactly what I ordered, justnot for what I want..."
5,"Works well, video quality has no glitches","I connected this to an adapter and another 6 foot HDMI-MicroHDMI cable. Everything worked.There were no issues with video. The connectors appear solid, and fit well in the sockets.The cable worked as expected to send signal 31 feet with no issues."
4,Great product for the price,Purchased this cable to connect PC to HDTV. Works great delivers great picture and sound form PC to Samsung plasma tv.
3,"Works, but not for me.","I had no doubts about whether or not this cable would work. It works fine with my dvd player to hdtv, but i wanted it for my desktop computer to connect to the hdtv. Unfortunately it did not work for me. I may have some more possibilities with the settings on the computer, but i still havent gotten it to work. the cable works, just doesnt do what i need it to do."
1,Didn't do sound...,Brought a good picture from laptop to tv but no sound. Not even a peep. I'm sending it back and ordering one from another company.
3,I got a problem with it,I got a problem with it. Actually I wanted one wire. But I got two wires. I wanted return it. But It was too late.
5,1080p on the cheap,"Often you get what you pay for, in this case you get what others appear to pay for.This cable is exactly what they say it is, an HDMI 25 foot length. While my application does not use audio, I get 1080p to my projector from my source.Someone complained that the cable is thick. Of course it is, 25 feet is about the maximum length you get from HDMI without attenuation (loss). Thick would imply (although not necessarily guarantee) a stronger signal. And 25 feet implies installation, this is not something you want wound up behind your flat-screen hung on the wall.The connections are nice and solid and fit (what else is there to say?).If you have a need for 25 feet of HDMI this is an excellent cable, and a total bargain at the price I bought it ~$8.55.Pros: Thick, 1080p, good connectionsCons: None."
2,Doesn't work,"I purchased this a couple of months ago and tried it, but didn't work. Just looked today to try and return it, unfortunately the expiration ran out. Silly me for not returning it before it expired."
5,Work Well,"I saw a few of the negative reviews about these but opted to take a chance anyway. I purchased 3 of the 25 foot ones. All the worked just fine. I use them for my computer monitor, HD dvr box, and xbox 360. Connectors are solid and have had no picture issues. If I need anymore I will be ordering these."
5,Great Purchase,"I think they wanted like $100+ for cables just like this at Best Buy. Are they nuts?! These cables are great. They work just as they should and literally cost pennies compared to what the ""big store"" was asking. Great buy!"
5,Works Great,"I use this from my Nvidia card to my 23"" lcd wall mounted in my bathroom.....works great!!! Even going through a 4X2 HDMI switch....no problems here....well worth it!"
2,Cheap Cables,"I typically don't write bad reviews for items or give low ratings, but these cables don't work that well for long distances, I had to purchase a more expensive cabling after returning these items. I was getting greet dots or no signal, I replaces these with [...] and I couldn't be happier.These cheap cables might be good for just connecting this and that, but for quality control purposes no.Would I recommend this item? No! These are not good for home theater or distance runs, these are decent cheap cables if you don't care about quality of them."
5,Works great!,I bought this cable to hook my laptop to my tv so I can watch shows and movies off the internet as well as from the dvd drive on my laptop. It works well. It stays connected better than the other cable I have which is really nice. The long length is convenient because it allows you to get some space between your tv and where you are from it so you're not sitting right on top of your tv or constantly getting up every time you want to change something on the laptop. The price was really good for this cable and definitely a good buy.
5,Works Beautifully,"25' cable in use for one month, works beautifully and I was happy to save money compared to Radio Shack prices close to $80."
2,Better options available,"This cable worked for a little while, but it was still insert remove insert remove insert remove until it caught the signal.I sent it back and purchased the ""Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable With Ethernet"" instead, and that works like a charm.Avoid!"
2,"Great price, mediocre durability.","I purchased this cable for an in-wall installation. Prior to installing in the actual wall I tested it with a laptop. It worked at first but then I jostled the end a little bit (in error, not on purpose) and the signal stopped. I plugged it in and took it out a few times trying to get it to work but to no avail. Looking inside the end of the cable I could see that a couple of the connections were hopelessly bent and rendered the cable completely worthless. So while the price was right the durability of the cable certainly was not."
4,Works perfectly,The HDMI cord i purchased works perfectly. Can't beat the price. The same cord costs $40-$50 in any of the nearby stores I had checked.
3,Poor construction but good performance,Cable seems to be cheaply made (the plug looks slightly loose) but it works fine and the price was great.
2,ordered two,I ordered two of them one still works very well the other one stopped working after about a monththe price was so cheap that its still a bargain unless you really needed two
1,Dont waste your $,Defective and had to return Spend the extra few $ and get the Blue Rigger? Don't make the same mistake I did
4,25 ft HDMI cable,"Very nice, great to hook up laptop and TV so you can place laptop in a convenient spot while watching."
4,very good,this item was what i was looking for. it did what i needed it to do. was very happy with it.
4,When size matters,When the cord you have isn't long enough to get the job done the will do the trick! This is a well made cable for the price.
5,Cheap cable that works,This is a cheap cable that works and was the distance i needed it to be. Don't be fooled by radio shack.
1,CHEAP,"Monoprice has much better HDMI cables, for a lower price. This one was cheap in price, and very cheap in quality."
2,Not too clear,I bought this cable so I could view the lap top on my LED flat screen TV. The colors are all glittery and mixed up. Not what I expected. Regret not getting a better quality of cable.
3,Functional,It was functional. No jaw dropping excellence but no problems either. I used to connect my computer to my TV and it worked well.
2,Low video quality,"I used the cable to connect a computer monitor to a tower in a different room, the cable is functional for basic use, but has mild to severe red ""static."" I wouldn't recommend this cable for anything that requires quality video signals."
5,It works. 'Nuff said.,"I tried to run 2 TVs from a single HDMI source. The nearest TV already worked. The farther TV worked, using this cable. I tried to use a HDMI splitter to run both TVs at once. It did not work; not sure why. Either TV worked when fed through the splitter, but when they were both connected, the TVs no longer displayed anything. Maybe the insignificant signal bounce became more pronounced with 2 TVs."
5,HDMI perfection,Such a lovely deal for a 25ft cable. Most products in stores are outrageously priced for such a simple device. I received my cable in perfect condition. Fast shipping~ I am very pleased with this HDMI cable. I use it daily and still no problems.
3,Needs a video repeater for my use,"Maybe its not the fault of the cable itself but I tried using this with my Viewsonic Video Projector and the image quality and colors suffered. I learned that I needed to purchase a(n) HDMI repeater (signal booster) to make it work with my particular projector. It may work just fine with other devices, I don't know because I didn't test it out with them yet."
4,Link Depot HDMI Cable From Amazon,"This is a very decent cable and also very inexpensive. I received it in just over a week and am very happy with it. I only wish I had gone for the longer (poss. 35-50') instead of 25' as it is a little short of my needs. MY BAD for not measuring correctly but again I am completely happy with both price and quality, and will use them again if and when needed."
2,"Nice length, but poor quality.","Ordered this back in April so I could have my XBOX 360 hooked up to my flat panel tv which was hanging on the opposite wall. I loved that it was long enough to run it through my drop ceiling hiding the cord. It worked wonderfully until about a week ago. When I started noticing audio cutting out and little white dots appearing on the screen. I investigated to ensure it wasn't the T.V. or the XBOX. It is clearly the HDMI cable though. As when I hook up other cabled the problem goes away. The price was great and it seemed solidly built at first but considering it went out less than 6 months after I bought it I have to give it a poor rating as it really is not that great of an HDMI cable after all. It would be smarter to buy a more expensive one that will last longer, than buying a new one of these ever 5-6 months."
4,Great value for money,I was initially apprehensive to buy an inexpensive HDMI cable (and that too 25ft long) when all cables I looked for in BestBuy and the sorts were North of $40.I use this cable to connect my laptop to my LCD TV and it works like a charm. It carries audio and video in the same cable. I am happy to have purchased this product.
2,Terrible Connectors,"It's really a good quality signal if you can keep the connectors, well, connected. I had one that worked fine for quite a while until it was knocked a bit when still plugged into the TV, and the wires came right out of the connector. To replace that I bought 2 just in case (1 has a backup). One of those was completely DOA and the connectors on the second one came out the same way my first one did a week later. Just spend more money for better quality connectors."
5,Fantastic product at a amazingly low price!!!,"I am blown away at the quality vs. price worth here. The product shipped a day early in solid packaging, and it works fantastically. Games, movies, and everything else works perfectly well with this cable with great quality and no lag or performance issues. Since 25ft cables have a price tag of 250 USD at Bestbuy, this was a steal for the quality and price. Definitely recommended."
4,worked just fine,"the cable worked just fine for me, video quality with it was just as good as any other cable i have"
3,"Great customer service, but all products didn't work","Great customer service, but they sent to wrong length HDMI cords, and the right length they sent didn't work properly. They sent 10 ft instead of 25 ft. The 10 ft cables worked fine, but all 3 25 ft cables flashed static every few seconds when on 1080p, but was fine on 720p. They were very thin too, unlike the 10 ft cables. I gave this a 3 because the company immediately sent out the right size, with an extra one even though they didn't work right unless it wasn't the 720p or less and sometimes still had static. They let me keep the 10 ft cables for the inconvenience. You get what u pay for though. These were about $7 a piece. I bought a monster 35 ft cable for $100 for my projector attached to the ceiling, so good quality for that length is best. I might have just been that they don't make them strong enough for that length, since the 10 ft was thicker n worked fine."
2,it was not 25 feet,it was not 25 feet like it said. it was only 20 feet but i didnt care because it was long enough for my purpose.
5,Cheap and it works,"It's cheap and ugly but gets the job done. It's one of those cables where you're probably going to hook it up and forget about it for the next 5 years so the cheapness is acceptable. It works fine and is just what I needed to get a new television I installed in my office on one wall, to the cable box against the other wall."
5,HDMI cables,these HDMI cables work great and are long enough for wall mounting your big screen TVs in real world locations.Perfect for the price!
1,after having it 4 months it's not working so well,It starts popping every time there's a screen transition between my xbox and the tv (breaking signal then reconnecting and making a weird popping noise) The end piece broke off randomly one day for no reason. Would not buy again
1,hdmi cable,25ft hdim 2 cable from link depot after 3 months end came apart had to replace more shiping was more than the cable
1,Didn't work,"Mine never worked, plugged it in scrambled picture then black and no sound. Get what you pay for. Will opt for a better cable next time."
1,Cable-Broke_on-the-first-day,"I guess you get what you pay for or at least for this product. The cable bent easily and broke off of my laptop on the first day after receiving it. So, I would definitely spend the extra money on another brand of cable."
1,DOA,"I was very excited to get this cord, and move my rather bulky htpc to be a little more out of sight. However, when it came, I plugged it in, and was disappointed that the image had blue static in all the dark areas and was shaking and flickering. I tried it with a friends laptop to the same result. It's likely I just got a bad cable, but I'm leery to try again. But, kudos to Amazon for making the return dead simple though."
5,Display 3D Movies and Pictures,I used this cable to display both video and pictures in 3D from a Finepic 3D W3 camera to a LG 3D tv.
1,Don't buy,Ordered 2 cables for cheap and both of them show lines and dots on my TV. Not going to waste time sending them back. Will just got to radioshack and buy good cables.
1,Picture pixelated - sound distorted,I've had a few other Link Depot cords that worked perfectly; this one did not. Picture was unwatchable with snow from a PS3 Blue Ray and DirecTV box routed through Pioneer Reciever. Audio had loud blips and inaudible portions.
1,Busted cable,"unfortunately did not functiongives the signal very snowy, distorted and only for a few seconds, then the signal stops and my projector has to search again, where it finds it, then does the same thing.All my other HDMI cables work just fine, but now i have to wait for another one until i can mount it... unfortunate :("
1,BOTH cables DEFECTIVE!,Connecting between Proscan LCD TV HDMI to Belkin HDMI/Mini Displayport Adapter to iMac Thunderbolt port. I only needed one cable but ordered 2 just in case. BOTH were DEFECTIVE! One cable just didn't work at all. The other had so many lines and noise it was unviewable. I tested my with 2 other cables that worked fine. Sure wish they worked. Seller was The OEM Shop and sending back using Amazon return process.
4,Works fine for me,"This hdmi cable works fine for me. Havnt had any issues yet. I'm not real rough with it I use it to plug my MacBook into my 52"" HDTV. It's run from my tv to my desk with my laptop along the wall so it doesn't move much. Happy do far."
4,cable works as it should,It is a basic HDMi cable. It works. There is nothing great to say and nothing bad to say. Just a working cable that did not cost alot
2,This HDMI cable doesn't work with a converter/adapter from Display port to HDMI,"This HDMI cable doesn't work with a converter from Display Port to HDMI, although it works with a HDMI port directly. I ordered 5 on Amazon.com, none of them works well with the converter/adapter, but the converter/adapter works well with other HDMI cable on my hand."
4,HDMI 25 feet,"HDMI 25' works well and the cheap price can't be beat, it worked perfectly for what I needed it for"
3,It's ok,This product is just ok. It works most of the time. Sometimes I have to mess with the Cable to get it working.
5,Great Product,"Needed this to connect my son's new computer to his HD TV. Works great, no problems (have been careful with plugging and unplugging cable ends, due to concerns noted by previous buyers, but it continues to work just fine), great price, quick shipping – total satisfaction!"
5,Working Great!,$6 for a 25ft. HDMI cable?! I love Amazon! Something like this would have cost like $40 anywhere else and it works flawlessly with my MacBook Pro!
3,"Wrong Item in packaging, but correct lable","Says the item is 25 foot HDMI to HDMI, but actually is Male HDMI to Male DVI 25 foot cable. Kept it since under $10 and I'm sure there will be a use for it. Even the barcode/label says it is HDMI to HDMI though. Item is fine, just the wrong product. Rating 3/5 for that reason"
3,Easily Broken Cheaply Replaced,"Cable actually worked just fine the first time I hooked it up and continued to work for a couple months. I was incredibly careful when I first hooked it up and ran the cord to my TV from PC. I treated the cable like it was very fragile and all went well. Unfortunately the first time I disconnected the cable and moved some things around I was not as careful, but was certainly not careless and the cable no longer works. So in short, Its cheaply made, cheap to buy, and cheap to replace! I WILL be buying another....cheap"
5,Great value at any price!,"I couldn't see spending 50 or 60 dollars to connect my computer to the TV, so I looked around. This did the job and it saved me a lot of money!"
1,Not for TV,"These cables don't work for HDTV, they are to light, had to use a better heavy grade cable, now it works."
5,"Good symphony, Great sonata","This symphony, when I first heard it, perplexed me, to say the least. I am a big fan of Shostakovich, especially the piano works (24 preludes and fugues, piano concertos and piano quintet are all incredible), but this was the latest work of his I had ever heard. As I listened more and more, however, I became increasingly impressed with it. Despite the sparseness of the first movement it stills carries the power of Shostakovich. There are some very musically profound moments all throughout the symphony. The sonata is amazing. Emil Gilels interpretation is easily the best one I have ever heard. He takes it from a very cool, almost stoic perspective. It fits the music perfectly. The mechanical precision brings out the genius and power of this great work. I highly recommend this CD."
3,Buy it for Gilels,"To be brutally honest, Ormandy sleepwalks through a dreary performance of the 15th - listen to Barshai for an example of how to make this symphony work - but it's worth getting the CD for Gilels' wonderful version of the second sonata."
3,"A bland run-through, nowhere close to the best","It's habitual for Amazon reviews to turn into cheerleading, but despite the affection Ormandy seems to arouse, this isn't a very good Shostakovich 15th. Ormandy's phrasing is too bland and uninflected. As execution, he leads the Phiadelphia Orchestra in the way one expects--the sound is plush and carefully modulated. But Shostakovich needs a lot more than that. There's no irony, savagery, or despair in this reading. Just of the versions I own, the ones by Feodesev, Haitink, Sanderling, and Mravinsky stand far ahead of this one."
1,Embarrassing,"This version of Shostakovich is horrible. Toward the last part of his conducting career, Ormandy's orchestra makes distinctive errors in playing. Of course, one has to be trained and has to be quick to hear these errors. I have many other versions of Shostakovich's 15th and his piano sonata. The piano sonata itself is ok, but the 15th in this version totally ruins the show."
2,"works, but is flimsy","Cheaply made, unattractive pieces of plastic. Nothing on it has broken on me yet, but I can foresee it happening as soon as I need to travel with it. I would recommend spending just a few dollars more and getting something more durable and attractive."
1,One star for design,"This earrings display is definitely not worth the money and detracts from what you are trying to sell. It is flimsy, the plastic scratches and breaks easily. Mine broke during assembly before I got to use it. It will surely not hold up to customers rotating it around by the tips of the thin, brittle plastic arms and it won't be their fault. There are metal ones out there that are more attractive and cost less. Do yourself a favor and skip this overpriced piece of junk."
5,Tired..Weak..Hungry..They fought until the end.Ive been ther,"I have read a lot of teen adventure books. I recently read this one while I was on a rugged boys canoe camp trip. We went on a 7 week trip with 12 men to labrador. I purchased this book because it was nonfiction and it was saying how these 3 brave, adventurous men took a trip similar to the area i'll be going to. It talked about how mothernature just (threre's really no word for it but...)Destroys these people and they fight back with courage and hope in succeeding this raw adventure. The three in progress of there adventure take care of eachother and keep eachother alive nad in this doing they become better than great friends almost brothers. I really don't want to ruin the book for you, but i suggest so strongly that you get a copy of this book, and oh yea the beginning of the book really is boring because it tells you of how they got to labrador in 1902 (they didn't have cars)."
3,Interesting tidbits about popular Saints,"I'm reading this book because it was selected by my book club. Although, I would not normally have picked this one for my normal reading, I found it covered a wide verity of different Saints with some interesting information I had not previously known about them."
5,My Life with the Saints,James Martin has a gift for making the saints come alive. His personal approach to how the saints have guided his spiritual and way of looking at life through their eyes has had me looking deeper into my own thinking. I would recommend this book to anyone who has basic knowledge of how the lives of saints can shape our lives.
3,Not too sure about this book.,I am approx half way through the book and I am not too impressed with it's content. As a matter of fact it's a bit boring. Why? I cannot put my finger on why it's boring. I will read it all and perhaps it will get better.
2,I was expecting better than this,"My Life With the Saints is Fr. Martin's memoir of his relationship with some of his favorite saints. In each chapter he tells about an event in his life and gives a short biography on the saint whom connected with him at the time.About half of the people mentioned such as Thomas Merton, whom the author seems to most admire, Fr. Arupe, Dorothy Day and Mother Theresa have not been cannonized and except for Mother Theresa it's not likely that they will be.The book pretty much falls down when the author talks about the cannonized saints. He completely fails to capture St. Therese but does better with the Jesuit saints. The chapters on St. Bernadette and the Ugandan martyrs were very good but two chapters don't justify buying the whole book.I was actually surprised with how theologically slight this book is. Coming from a Jesuit I was expecting something with more depth and it really feels like it was written for kids or older teens. I was not satisfied at all."
5,Best book I've read in a long time.,"If you want to learn more about heroes of the faith, this is a great book. I'm not Catholic but the stories here truly inspired me."
5,"I read, then reread this book. Stack your life up against the saints and add some of your favorites to walk with you .","I read, then reread this book. Stack your life up against the saints and add some of your favorites to walk with you.""Magis"""
4,wonderful book to start with the saints life,I got struck by this book among other introdectory books to saints' life. SJ Martin was a excellent reader of biography of saints as well as of his own life. He introduced several of his favorite saints with the real life impact on his experience. I recommend this book to every one who is not so familiar with Catholic saints' story but very keen on learning and understanding their virtues.
5,A Good Book from A Great Soul,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The saints aren't adored but they're deeply appreciated as the human beings they were. I bought it six months ago and have already started a second reading.
5,My Life with the Saints,"This author and book are absolutely fantastic. I have been recommending this book to every person I know. I thank God for James Martin, SJ and and for the Saints."
5,Amazing,I absolutely loved this book. I have always wanted to learn more about the saints and this book was perfect. Its really engaging and I enjoy how it is a personal story of Fr. Martin's own journey with the saints. This is a must read!
4,So far ...very good,"Not often a religious book is a page turner, but Fr. Martin's conversational style has kept me intrigued and coming back for more."
5,Love this book!,I really love this book! I am a Catholic and avid reader and I enjoy reading the lives of the Saints. This book is just a really enjoyable read for anyone who has devotion to our beloved Heavenly friends!!
2,Not crazy about it,"Well, this book was written in 1992 ou 93? and since then a lot of things have changed in the world of translation. Now people use different softwares, websites, and so on... Had no idea the book was so outdated."
1,Politicized junk,"Ms. Baker's work suffers from her political extremism. She is well know for firing translators because they happened to be Israeli citizens, and calling on others to do so, and this animus is reflected in her work."
5,Wonderful Bach,"I must agree with the other reviewer that this is a great collection. However, I like the presence of the boy alto in the Mass. Bach composed most of his religious works for a boys choir but you wouldn't guess it from looking at most recordings. To the best of my knowledge this Mass is the only recording out there that is both OVPP and includes a boy soloist. It works for me."
1,still waiting on my sunglasses,"Ordered these sunglasses on Jan 13, 2008 and they were too small. Sent me some sunglasses made for a child. They told me that they would replace them. I returned them for an exchange, and I'm still waiting on them. I can not get a responce from them on when or if the sunglasses will be sent. Now it has been over two weeks and still no word.Do yourself a favor and keep your money in your pocket."
5,good value,the watch is a good value quality piece. i am please with its looks and accurancy very pleased it looks great
1,"Not as described ""Heavy Duty""","This is the second time I have been asked too review this item. Because of the inconsistency of what I am familiar with as being ""Heavy Duty"" I will respond second time.The terminology as described by the vendor of ""Heavy Duty"" is not what I would have expected. I would go as far as to say that this item is even less ""Duty"" then what I would have purchased elswhere."
2,Same old same old,This book is no more than a rehash of what has already been written about in countless other books on JKD. The grappling material is very basic and limited. It is better covered and explained in other submission fighting books. There also should have been more closeups on the holds being applied as it is difficult to see many of them. Not something I would highly recommend unless you are just starting out.
5,was able to remove a stripped cover with this tool!,"i tried changing the battery on my x6hr with a nickel, but was able to get past the ""open"" slot. frustrated i tried using a screwdriver, and ended up stripping the cover slot (and was still unable to open the cover).The tool that comes with this kit saved the day. It's a metal coin shape (~size of a quarter) with two prongs tat fit into the 2 holes on each side of the main slot. it formed a solid connection with the cover, and after a few twists back and forth I was able to pop the old cover off, change the battery, and replace the cover.Well worth the money."
4,Suunto Battery Kit,A must have for anyone with a Suunto watch. I wish I knew about this before I tried to remove the battery from my Suunto. The kit comes with a cap remover to help remove the cap on the back without tearing it up. I would have liked to have the original cap but the kit does come with a new cap. Almost 5 stars if Suunto made this information easy to find when you buy the watch.
4,A knowlegable compilation,"They call Virginia Lynch the godmother of forensic nursing. Her text is packed with information about the many specialties available to the forensic nurse. Ms. Lynch had multiple authors contribute their ""best"" to this book. Linda Ledray writes about sexual assault, the others write about their own special practice and specialized knowledge in the field.I have to be honest, a few chapters read like ""stereo instructions"" while others were easier to read and held my interest. I strongly suggest this book for any student or someone who is simply interested in ""CSI"" type of information. If it is involved with forensics...it's in here.I have already used it multiple times for research and in my own practice."
4,Informative text,"This is a well written, informative text on forensic nursing. The subject matter is addressed in an easy to read/understand format. Obviously the author is well versed on her subject matter. I recommend this text to anyone who is interested in forensics."
1,"Uproariously funny, although not intentionally so.","Although the effect was no doubt unintentional, reading an academic tome which attempts to make sense out of Gertrude Stein's writing is well-nigh hilarious. If you'd be interested in reading paragraphs of explanatory material regarding the statement ""Peanuts blame, a half sand is holey and nearly"", this is unquestionably the book for you."
1,WORTHLESS PIECE OF TRASH,"I bought this camera from Target for my niece as a Christmas gift and was thoroughly embarassed by its lack of performance. It took lousy dark, blurry pictures. I originally thought the problem was the fact that the flash would not work, but when the flash finally decided to intermittently turn on (for no rhyme or reason), it obviously was not synched to the shutter in any way because the photos came out just as dark as when it wasn't on. The colors of the photos were all yellow and bright red regardless of the color of the object you took a picture of, and to claim that the resulting photos are 1.3MP is a joke. I have a 1.3MP Kodak bought 10 years ago that actually takes real usable photos and puts this piece of garbage to shame. It was returned to Target promptly. I'll spend a few extra dollars for a camera that she will be able to take pictures with. To sell this piece of junk as 1.3MP camera is a scam."
4,Card,Card was in good shape as stated on description. My son loves the card as part of his collection. The transaction went smoothly.
3,Ameristep 9402 15' Grizzly Deluxe Ladder Stand,This is a good product. I only gave it 3 stars because I thought the arm rails could of been a little bit higher which would give a little more security while sitting there. The product is good and solid.
3,Bachmann PCC Trolley,Bachmann PCC Trolley-PTC- N scale Expected to receive Brill trolley but received this trolley instead. Decided to keep anyway rather than pay to send it back.
5,my favorite ever!,"I look for this item everywhere and couldn't find it. It was one of the first items I ever bought trough amazon. I had th original LP... to me this is a collector's edition. I just loved it!!!!!!!!great seller, great transaction!"
3,Okay!,Entenmann's chocolate chip cookies are okay. But I prefer homemade from scratch or those ones where the dough is premade. I like Nestle Toll House Cookies and the Pillsbury ones. And for store bought premade chocolate chip cookies I prefer Pepperidge Farm! I must say that I prefer my chocolate chips crisp. I hate the soft batch variety!
2,Disappointing,"It was clear from the start that this was going to be an amature performance when the 'Father' of the church instructed the audience to turn off their cell phones - why in the world would you record this in 5.1 for all to see over and over again! The musicians are of average quality and the performance seems to be home-grown. The emotional appeal (in Israel where Jesus walked) is not enough to make this DVD anything but interesting. Get the Handel Messiah w/Cleobury, Dawson, Summers, & Brandenburg Consort - they get an A+ in my book."
3,Excited - Dissapointed,"Imagine my excitement at discovering that there is a BOC tab book. Imagine my disappointment at discovering that it does not include Then Came the Last Days of May, which contains the finest guitar playing they ever recorded. I would have bought the whole book just for that one song."
3,HOT AND COLD,"I WISH I WERE IN CHARGE OF MAKING THIS CD. I WOULD REPLACE THE REAPER AND GODZILLA'S TV MIX WITH MAYBE ""WINGS WETTED DOWN"" OR ""SEVEN SCREAMING DIZBUSTERS."" OTHERWISE THIS CD IS JUST FINE. THE NEWLY RECORDED BLUE OYSTER CULT GEMS ARE REALLY GOOD, ESPECIALLY ""ODed ON LIFE ITSELF."""
4,Low does the Smiths,"This CD contains two songs plus a Quicktime video:1) Last Night I Dreamt Somebody Love Me - A good version of the Smiths song. This version has a lot more build-up/release and drama than one would expect. Very much in the vein of ""Things We Lost in the Fire.""2)Because You Stood Still - An original that features a string section, could easily fit in on ""Things We Lost.""3) Video for ""Dinosaur Act"" - Very low budget, but an interesting look at Low on tour. Probably won't be able to see any other way.All in all, not a bad purchase for a Low fan. Smiths fans will probably want to think twice considering the price vs. the ammount of actual music."
4,Surprisingly good book,"Having never read anything by Wiggs before, I took a chance and ordered this one, expecting a run-of- the-mill story. I WAS WRONG! Thoroughly enjoyed the story, characterizations, and writing style of the author.Was it the best book i've ever read? No. There were a couple of parts i ended up skimming, but it was definitely worth reading. I also look forward to reading other books by this author."
2,Some Good Authors Write Bad Books,"This is the first book of Susan Wiggs' that I've read that did not meet her usual standard of excellence. The story and characters were lethargic and undeveloped. I read half of the book and didn't bother to finish it. If you're contemplating reading this one, skip it and move on to one of her five-star rated books. Wiggs is a worthy author, she just missed the boat on this one."
5,The Drifter,Susan has done again with this great love story and mystery. She makes reading such a pleasure. Keep them coming.
4,ENJOY SUSAN WIGGS,I have read several of her books and continue to enjoy her writing. The characters are clear and the writing is good.
5,A real Page-Turner!,"This was an excellent adventure and romance book. It gave a realistic look of addiction and how people become so manipulative and calculating to ""feed"" their addiction.. The reader finds themselves caught up in this drama involving the main characters of Leah, Jackson, and the self-destructive, Caroline. The dedication that Jackson had to help Caroline was admirable....but Caroline's behavior towards both Jackson and Leah was appaling. Jackson was so devoted to ""saving"" Caroline and was willing to risk everything for her. It was a sad look at what many families are facing in modern society today.This romance had extra elements in it that kept the plot strong and the reader's interest level high. I know others will love this book as well!"
4,Good,So far I haven't noticed any damage to the book. I did see highlights on the pages that i actually wasn't expecting. I have been reading it and there aren't any pages missing.
1,The description for this item is extremely misleading!,This is for the study guide edition of the book! It's not the actual text book! Nowhere on this page does it actually say its the study guide and even the picture doesn't say its the study guide!
1,Wrong Book,"I needed the text book, not the study guide. Amazon didn't even list the text book, so I didn't know there were two books."
4,My Favorite in 'The Cat Who' series,"Millionaire Jim Qwilleran and his two traveling companions, Koko and Yum Yum, go Down Below for a stay at the Casablanca. The Casablanca is an apartment building (that resembles a refridgerator) containing a cast of oddities, eccentrics and weirdos. A mystery of murder, mushrooms and a mustache lead to a wild turn of events and an end that starts at the beginning."
3,not her best,"i really do enjoy L. J. Braun's series, but this one was not her bast work. i thought she left a bunch of loose ends, from the casablanca hotel, the bracelet with scrabble numbers, and Qwilleran's stolen car. She seemed to be in a rush, and i didn't think Koko was his complete uncanny self."
3,A little disappointing,"I read the entire book, but it did not seem to be up to Ms. Braun's usual standard. It seemed as if the bookwas started by her,but the last few chapters were finished by someone else."
3,A Decent Read,"This is another great addition to the ""Cat Who"" series. Not the best in the series, but by far not the worst."
3,"It's a replacement, but not exact","This is a replacement head for the rotodent electric toothbrush, which is one of the best out there in my opinion. This replacement will work, however it is slightly too large, and can fall off during use. Irritating, but it gets the job done."
3,For die hard fans only,"This single does not have much to offer for the price. The Bunk remix is not nearly as good as the constantly consuming remix, which may be found on the first part of the imported single. The live version of the Hollow is pretty nice though, not much crowd noise at all though. The main selling point for this single is the fact that there is a CD Extra with the Judith music video on it. Quite honestly, as much as it is a great song, for a video it is lackluster with the band playing in a closed studio with candles all around them. It looks great and you get a good look at everyone in the band, but they could have done far more with the video in the first place."
2,Troy Van Leeuwin should not sing,"The live version of the hollow is very good with the renholder intro, is very clear and powerful sounding.The bunk remix is not good, the singing is very uninspired and bland, sounds kinda like Troy should be singing in a soft rock band, and the actual remix music is not good either.The video for Judith is great though as you get to see Paz and some pretty awesome drumming. however it remains a pretty weak single compared to the others off Mer de Noms."
4,Absorbing beginning,"Naoki Urasawa, Monster: Herr Dr. Tenma (ViZ, 1995)This is a volume of setup, but it's the kind of setup that shows that Urasawa had a strong sense of where the story was going from day one, and the more I read manga, the more rare I find out that is.Herr Dr. Tenma introduces us to Kazuo Tenma, a promising young doctor (who bears more than a slight resemblance to Black Jack) who left Japan, where his outlook was bleak, for a more promising career path in Germany. He finds himself unwilling, and ultimately unable, to cope with hospital politics, however, when he is given the choice between saving the young son of an obscure East German official who fled to West Germany not long before and saving the Mayor of Dusseldorf. The choice he makes turns out to have consequences beyond any he thought it would, however.An excellent beginning to what promises to be an exciting series. Hopefully I'll get the next few books soon. ****"
4,A great phone,This phone is great. I am able to drive with complete ease and not have to worry about my phone. The ear bud took a bit to get use to but now it is good. I recomend it for anyone who is on the phone while driving alot.
3,Angel Witch - '2000:Live At LA 2' (Zoom Club) 3 1/2 stars,"Twelve track CD release by none other than the notorious UK metal merchants, Angel Witch. A good effort,but it's too similar to their 1990 'Live' title put out on Metal Blade. Bet most of you remember that disc. Recorded in May, 2000 at London's Astoria Theatre. Must admit it was fun to fully experience once again cuts like ""Atlantis"", ""Confused"", the gothic-like ""Gorgon"", ""White Witch"", the eerie ""Sorceress"", ""Angel Of Death"" and the band's namesake ""Angel Witch"". The guitar solo is also pretty well done. Guess AW main man / mastermind Kevin Heybourne simply refuses to give up on the business. I only wish I could see Angel Witch play sometime. Always thought they were like, MAYBE a second rate Motorhead. Semi-recommended."
3,Just an OK Book!!,"Expect to use a Tablesaw or Miter Saw when using this book. There is an acknowledgement at the beginning of the book, but no other text throughout other than the dimensions of each house. No cutting recommendations, etc., just dimensioned drawings. Don't expect too much from this book."
4,Lots of Designs,Plenty of ideas to choose from with lots of illustrations. Some building skills would be helpful. Simple kits to build can be found at houses4birds.com
2,Not a good choice,"This book was a huge disappointment. It offers nothing but some drawings with dimensions. There are no hints, no instructions, nothing. If I weren't fairly skilled at figuring these things out, this book would be a total waste to me."
3,Waiting for CPC Edge HD,"The original CPC was so easy to use; I could observe objects with the whole family. Set-up was easy; it found every object I wanted to observe. But the corrector plate on the unit I owned had obvious flaws (streaks, bubbles, spider web-like structures); I returned the product. I am waiting for Celestron to release a CPC with the new Edge HD design."
4,North American Indian Artifacts 5th ed.,"A Well written informative coverage of the tools, clothing, pottery and baskets used for every day life, with 1994 prices."
3,Order it big,"This is a great looking shirt, but make sure you order it really large. Previous reviews had warned me so I did order a size larger than my husband ordinarily wears, but even that was snug. Snug Ts are OK if they feel comfortable but it choked him so they had to go back."
2,works but unreliable,"As noted above this device stops working and requires a reset. Many times during the day it seems to ""fall asleep"" and does not respond for a few seconds."
2,Mouse Review,"This mouse has been problematic from the start. At first it worked great, then it did not work at all. I was about to call the company to find out what was happening, but I decided to try the product again and this time it worked. If it does not work again, I will certainly call the company."
1,Crap,"This mouse is crap. It worked for about 6 weeks, then steadily degraded to the point where it doesn't work at all. I didn't use it heavily. Don't waste your money on this mouse!"
1,Eats batteries,"This mouse eats batteries like there's no tomorrow. I sent it back and got a Logitech MX1000 Laser Cordless Mouse instead.It's rechargable, has many more buttons and features, and costs MUCH less when you include the cost of all those batteries!"
2,Nice mouse. Eats batteries,"Nice mouse with a compact reciever and a clever design for storing it inside the mouse. But it burns through batteries. Even taking them out at night, only got ~10 days use. And no off switch!"
2,Battery Life,"If you are lucky, you might get 2 weeks out of the batteries before they have to be replaced. Other than that, the mouse is great."
1,This is a piece of Junk - Don't Buy,"This thing is a piece of junk. It is not really Honeywell it is made by a company called Yaz. How do I know that? well when it quit working less than 6 weeks after I got it, I had to email and email to get a Return Authorization. The best is I HAD TO PAY THE RETURN SHIPPING (did I mention I only had it 6 weeks???) I have paid for the unit, I dont have one, and YAZ has not responded to the return.Less than zero stars for this..."
1,Dont buy this for MAC's,"This item is advertised incorrectly. None of the games are for MAC. I have broken the seal around the 4 games and am now out 19.99. This specifically says it is for MAC OSX thats why I bought it. Even if you were buying this for your PC beware, the games sre for windows 95/98!DONT BUY THESE!"
4,Heavy Duty with nice grips,This cookie sheet was actually a gift for my mother. Not the most glamorous of gifts but she asked for a new cookie sheet and I tried to give her the nicest one I could find. She really likes the silicone grips that don't totally make potholders unnecessary but do reduce the chances of burning one's fingers. This sheet is made of a thicker sheet of aluminum than your typical cookie sheet. The sheet also came with a small cooling rack so it might be nice for someone just starting a home as well.
1,Not as fast as it looks in the commercial-bad design,"When this first came out this summer the commercial looked like they were zipping through the water, and being a pessimistic consumer I realized that this was probably an exaggeration, so I waited until it went on clearance at Walmart for $35.00 before I finally succumbed to my daughters pleeeesssseee!!!Took it home-you have to take it apart to charge the battery, took it to the pool the next day and she soon realized that she could swim underwater three times as fast as this could go, so she quickly lost interest, then the light wouldn't go off.Took it home and when I took the cover off to disconnect the battery the chamber was full of water (not supposed to happen-I guess when I was tightening the screws one of them apparently was stripped) and the battery was oozing acid, when I tried to unhook the charging wires one of them broke off the battery!So on top of the ""not as fun factor"" After one use I now owned a broken piece of junk!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIIS TOY,"Bought this for my nephew. First time he used it in the pool - He loved it - it's a lot of fun - he had a great time for about 20 min. We figured the battery had to be charged - when we tried to charge it the battery ""popped"" & didn't work any longer. I was sent a replacement. On his very first try it died - when his father tried to charge the battery it popped again the some of the acid seeped out. I returned it & got a refund. I don't recommend this toy."
3,submersible cruiser,"it is okay. the weight limit is only 100 pounds, this fact is not well marketed. The battery is especially hard to get to and change. You must removed 4 very long screws. The light never goes off, so the battery is constantly draining when not in use. When my 10 year old is using it he has a lot of fun. That is the plus."
5,shears,"I bought these shears and love the size and cuts your hair great, most others are to long this size is perfect for everyone and the price is right from Amazon.Plus free ship.I cut my own hair and my husbands too..great shears."
4,Great Value,"Nice, well-made watch. The face is quite a value for this price point, nicely detailed and polished in appearance. The band, however, is far too thin for my tastes. The leather patching is unattractive, and the nylon strap does not look sturdy. I am happy with this watch as a casual, occasionally worn item, but I am currently searching for a replacement strap. I would rate this watch with 3-stars, but it is still a good buy under $100."
5,High-value relistenability,"Being a fan of the Vengaboys and even being lucky enough to see them live (San Francisco 1999), I must say that this album is awesome! This rates higher than The Party Album. As usual with this genre, lyrics are out there but very catchy. The VCD is a good value for the small price it adds to the album. The video quality is not great but it's good enough and audio is fine. (Maybe if they had not put the karaoke versions and increased quality...) This is a very energetic album and very upbeat. It'll make you smile and bob your head!"
4,Good cd,I have listen to the sample and found that it's a great one. I am going to get one for myself!
5,Cosmic Debussy,"I've listened to this album for over 30 years and it is still my stellar favorite, and sounds so much better on CD. ""Claude Debussy meets cosmic interpretations."" The listener experiences a wide-range of synthesizer music and effects, often unusually beautiful, as Tomita creates new worlds within Debussy's tonal poems. Highly recommended: ""Reverie"" [this version was used in our wedding], ""Clair de Lune,"" ""Arabesque,"" ""The Engulfed Cathedral,"" and ""Girl with the Flaxen Hair."" Moreover, ""Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun"" is now included, which was not available on the original album."
2,Great music - Bad remix,"This is the ""High Performance"" RCA Red Seal / BMG Classics audiophile disk, which plays on surround-sound or regular CD players. The remix is clean. However, the sound levels are too high or too low in many places. So, the volume will be so soft sometimes that you can't hear it. But, if you turn it up to a normal volume, then a few minutes later it will suddenly become so loud it will shake the rafters in your house, and very possibly, blow out your speakers! There's a warning in the liner notes that says ""due to the nature of 24/96 technology,...you may be startled by the powerful dynamics of the music."" I was startled, to say the least. So were my neighbors. With all this high-tech gear they used to remix this album, you'd think they could adjust the volume better."
5,Interesting Spin on the Debussy Piano Pieces,"OK, yes, the music on this CD goes a bit overboard a couple of times. I could do without ""Golliwog's Cakewalk"", for example.But at it's best, it approaches doing for Debussy what Walter/Wendy Carlos did for Bach...it preserves the original mood of the pieces and adds a lot of new color. Tomita's version of ""The Girl With The Flaxen Hair"" remains one of my all-time favorite pieces. ""The Engulfed Cathedral"", ""Passepied"", and the title cut are also very nice.This album gave me a new perspective on and appreciation of Debussy."
3,Titilating,"Girl Meete Girl and Vampire Ectasy were pretty disappointing but, Butterfly was more erotic. Marie Forsa is the best thing in all three movies, which is why I wanted to own them. There is some very good sex scenes in Butterfly and a pretty good story. More explicit shots of Maria Forsa would have been great but, the ones that are there are quite good."
5,LUIS MIGUEL is one of the worlds GREATEST VOICES,"LUIS MIGUEL, WOW! fantastic, incredible, you can use ALL the 'SUPERLATIVE' words to discribe this amazing artist, HE REALLY IS SECOND TO NONE. I have every CD available and every VIDEO available, 32 CD's and 7 DVD Video's, and can recommend everyone of them to anyone. It's not just his fabulous voice you will also hear fabulous musical arrangements played by some of the finest musicians I have ever heard. If you like the song 'HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS', believe me you haven't heard it till you've heard LUIS MIGUEL sing it! and that arrangement!. I eagerly await his next CD and VIDEO, they couldn't be anything but 'FANTASTIC'. Amazon, please insert this review in EVERYTHING you have listed for the worlds number ONE artist, THE AMAZING 'LUIS MIGUEL'."
5,Get Better Now and Enjoy It,"This has been one of the best books I have ever read on this topic. Using humor, which flows natural throughout, the author makes the subject matter of homeopathy not only enjoyable, but thoroughly understandable.The glossary is wonderful. The author is very adept in describing symptoms in order for the reader to find his/her problem easily.Her thorough knowledge on this topic is apparant. Along with recommendations for a cure, the author spends a good amount of time on prevention and maintaining your health.Without the least hesitation, I highly recommend this first-rate book on this subject of Homeopathy for the beginner and the advanced. I haven't seen anything this good, on this topic, in a long time."
1,Terrible Quality,"These washers were simply terrible. If you are thinking to yourself, 'how can someone mess up a washer?' then order some of these and find out.5% were stuck together from whatever they were dipped in.5% looked corroded5% mis-formedI'd say out of a box of 100, 70 were usable. Also, the washers looked like they were made from pot metal, not even a low grade construction steel."
4,In your face 80s metal!!!,"I bought this album when I was 13 years old back in 1986. I loved it then, I love it now. The music is very solid. The singing is better than Mark Slaughter, and the songs are very catchy. Vinnie's rhythem playing is very cool, but the solos [are bad]. His playing is sloppy, uncontrolled, and monotonous. I know of a million guys that can play faster and cleaner than Vinnie...That aside, the songs are really good, and Vinnie's rhythems are great. Buy this album, but don't get excited about the fast playing, because, believe me, it is very sub-par. My favorites include ""Shoot ya full of Love"", ""Twisted"", ""Boyz r gonna Rock"", and ""Do ya wanna make love"". The last 3 minutes of ""Invasion"" is the biggest waste of space."
2,Where are the pictures?,This book promises to introduce the world of mathematics to the layman but doesn't quite deliver. It has a great premise and raises many interesting questions but fails to answer them in a concise manner (and one that the average Joe can understand). A few more diagrams and illustrations would do wonders for the clarity of the author's explanantions. A great bibliography leads readers to better work.
3,Not enough information,"The Science Masters series is a very good idea, but, as with all multi-authored series, the individual books are very variable in content. This one's in the middle, not as good as Jared Diamond's 'Why sex is fun', but not as bad as Peter Atkins' 'Periodic Kingdom'. It's just too basic, this book won't stretch anyone who's read any other popular maths book"
1,A Good Violinist Hampered by an Incompetent Harpsichordist,"Holloway is great, although not nearly as imaginative as Reinhard Goebel, whose Biber remains unsurpassed. But Moroney is utterly dull, devoid of flair or insight into the liveliness of Baroque music. Because of his dry, lifeless playing this recording, which might have been a real contribution, is just a disservice to Biber, whose flamboyance is muted by the English reserve of the duo."
5,TEEN LUIS MIGUEL,"THIS IS THE FIRST ALBUM OF LUIS MIGUEL WITH WARNER BROS.HE WAS ONLY SEVENTEEN AT THAT TIME AND THE PERFORMANCES IN THIS CD ARE GREAT,THERE ARE A LOT OF COVERS,GREAT PRODUCTION,GREAT VOICE,A LUIS MIGUEL CLASSIC!,IT INCLUDES ""ALL BY MYSELF"",I ONLY WANT TO BE WITH YOU"",""LOVE ME WITH ALL YOUR HEART""-CUANDO CALIENTA EL SOL- AND MORE!"
4,Latin pop with Anglo connections,"""Soy Como Quiero Ser"" is an enjoyable collection from Latin pop king Luis Miguel. All of the songs are in Spanish, and many of them are Spanish versions of pop songs that were popular in English. Listeners may recognize such tunes as ""Perdoname"" (in English, its chorus was ""All by Myself"") and ""Sunny,"" among others. There is a good mix of faster and slower tempo songs.Luis brings great enthusiasm, as well as a strong and versatile voice, to his performances. I was particularly impressed by his rendition of the title song. There are two duets, including one with Laura Branigan (""Sin Hablar""). Overall, not his best album, but still good collection of songs."
2,"Cliffs Notes are better, in this case","I'm currently reading Beloved for a class and I am reading the cliffs notes and spark notes as I read the book. They both do well summarizing the text, but the cliffs notes go more in depth and are an easier read to boot."
5,Track Listing,1. All The Things You Are2. A Night In Tunisia3. Orchard Road4. My Foolish Heart5. Summertime6. Blues For The Saxophone Club7. Always in Love (For Nesuhi)8. All Blues9. Carousel In A Child's Mind
2,You can find much better,"This book is old. Perhaps that is the only good part about it as it contains the scoring standards of the Army almost two decades ago. This book has only generic information on the topics of nutrition, grass drills, guerilla drills, cals, running, strength training, and rucking. The information is so basic that, provided you have any background in physical fitness, will be common sense to you. There are three workouts in the book which overlap each other and contain little or no detail. Do not purchase this book if you have any sense about military fitness."
5,The Spectre is an awesome character..........,This graphic novel reprints the first 4 issues of the SPECTRE series by John Ostrander and Tom Mandrake. They redefined the character for a new generation and did not throw out any of his previous history (he dates back to the 1940s). Ostrander is one of the best writers in comics and is not afraid to tackle controversial topics. The artwork of Mandrake is both moody and exquisite at the same time. They made an awesome team and this comic was the best one published by DC in quite awhile. The comic was voluntarily ended by Ostrander but what great stories he gave us (well over 60 issues of classic storytelling).
5,Typical Class Act by Fiedler and the Pops,"Fielder brought out the very best of the Boston Pops, certainly moreso than its conductors following him. This recording just gives us more of what we expect of anything by the Pops under Fiedler's direction ... great music played with instrumental skill and good old enthusiasm, something significantly lacking in many orchestras of today. Sadly, there'll never be another Fielder, nor another Boston Pops as it was when he was at the podium."
1,Not as good as it appears to be...,"I bought this laminator based on the ONE, five-start review on this product - what a mistake! It makes a very loud ""vibrating"" noise the entire time, takes FOREVER for it warm up, and it doesn't seal the pouches all the way, creating air pockets all around the items that is laminated. I'm very disappointed and I'm returning this item straight away."
1,know the facts first,The problem with this product is that it only suports 3 mil lamination pouches. this is never mentioned in the specs. You will be disappointed if you think running a 5 mil through two or three times will make it work - it will not.i'm returning it
3,Please note 'Intl',"Hi gadget geeks!This is model BP650SI (not BP650S), and it is designed for international use. You may wish to consider this information before you make your purchase."
1,Living The Science of Mind,I never got this book. Where is it or where is my money? Did not get the book. What happen? Please let me know.
5,Everyone should read this book,"EXPANDExpand who you are, how you look at life, relationship with the Divine.See the Divine in a new perspective, and embrace your oneness with the Divine.Wonderful BookThank youRev. Allen"
5,Great Book for Locals and Visitors!,"We have family that lives throughtout the world. In order for them to get an idea of what our home, the Hampton Roads area, is like, this book is fantastic! Before this was published there wasn't a book available with good photographs, and up-to-date information about just the Hampton Roads area. The books that were published focused on Williamsburg, civil war history, and the old plantation homes. The photos are fantastic, the text is well written, and it is current information. We have purchased three of these books already, and will get more for other family members and friends. Great Book!"
1,Do not buy anything from Buymebuyme.,Their customer service sucks. I will never buy things from this guy.
2,Early chapters focused on coming of age issues as well as too many men on a small island.,"I expected more focus on the bomb tests, technology, scientists and related topics. The book was heavily front loaded with ""coming of age in the military"" stories, unrelated to my interests; but not without some relavence to the place and times the author describes."
1,Fictional account of life on Eniwetok Atoll,"I say this is a fictional account of life on Eniwetok Atoll because the author has elected to write the book like a piece of fiction using all made up names. The other negative reviews for this book say everything else that is wrong with the book, but for the record I don't doubt the government put people in harm's way, made mistakes, and did horrible things to good people. This author elected to go down the predictable Liberal path of overdramatizing what took place,and being overly moralizing and sanctimonious In the reviewers section at the beginning of the book is a review by Christie brinkley, This should be enough warning about how bad this book will be, when a brain dead Celebrity like Christie Brinkley reviews something.Skip this book and instead read IVY-Mike by W.G. Van Dorn"
1,Somebody's been watching MASH,This book appears to be written by someone who has watched too many MASH episodes. With a good deal of Catch 22 thrown in. Claims to be fact but appears to be fiction.
3,Enjoyable book for cat lovers,"A quick easy read and very enjoyable for someone like me who loves cats (although I don't have any animals now as hubby is very allergic to animal fur).The late Cleveland Amory is probably most famous for his work with animal rescue groups and his cat books. If you've ever been ""owned"" by a cat you'll like this short book about a stray cat that he takes in on Christmas Eve. He becomes very attached to the cat and names him Polar Bear. Loved his description of trying to give Polar Bear a pill and also how Polar Bear reacts to a stray dog and stray kitten that the author takes in for a short time (Polar Bear does NOT like them lol) and then Polar Bear's reaction to having to share his balcony with a hurt pigeon.(less)"
5,So touching yet entertaining book,"I love the book so much...It is great for everyone who has a gentle heart, no matter if you have had cats. I did not know the author until I read the book, then I feel so sad that he already died, otherwise he would be the person that I want to speak with in person. I'm going to buy all of his books."
2,I raised the white flag...,"I am a cat lover and once, I had a Christmas cat too. She was a stray and she visited me on the eve of Christmas. From then on, we're friends. As much as I would like to give this book a 5-star rating, I couldn't do it. It started all right and after all, it's 5 more days to Christmas -- a great time to read something like this. I even like it's first sentence: ""To anyone who has ever been owned by a cat, it will come as no surprise that there are all sorts of things about your cat you will never, as long as you live, forget.""Sadly, further down the reading, it got tired. Too much historical details and whatever else. I had to force myself to continue reading and there came a point I just can't do it anymore. I waved the white flag. Don't get me wrong, I love cats but I wished the book could've been more reader-friendly."
2,Not as cute as the author thinks it is,"This is not a terrible book, but it does get old in a hurry. The main narrative about the rescue of a stray cat, who the author adopts and eventually calls Polar Bear is entertaining, but too much has been done to make it ""cute"", like pages of imagined conversation between the author and the cat. There are also tons of digressions, about animal cruelty, historic views of cats and so on. It is also very dated in its discussion of the animal rights movement. I think there are a lot of better books in the ""beloved pet"" genre."
2,Reading this book is like ...,"being stuck in an elevator with someone who won't stop talking about their cat!Don't get me wrong. I have two cats and I like cats, but why would anyone want to read a 15-page description of how someone else named their cat?I gave the book two stars only because it is such a fascinating and shining example of anthropomorphism run amok. In that sense it's more of a study of human behavior than of cat behavior and should probably be required reading in some college psychology classes. : )"
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read!,"""The Cat Who Came For Christmas"" is the best book I have ever read. I am a cat person, and I have two cats. Cleveland Amory wrote a book that I can really relate to. Polar Bear (The cat) is extremely intresting to read about. I accidently stumbled upon this book at the library, and I decided to see if it was any good. When I learned that, yes, it was extremely good, I rushed right back to the library to get the rest of the trilogy! This is one book you don't want to miss!"
2,"What do you think of ""curmudgeons?""","This is one of those book that I had to write a review for, simply because my expectation of it (from fame, reviews, etc.) was so high, and the reality fell so far short. I think one's feelings about it will be pretty well predicted by one's feelings about self-described ""curmudgeons"" such as the author. Personally, I am very tired of people who take pride in their own intractable nature and think it is some sort of blessing on the world for teaching others to be patient. Additionally, the author appears to be someone who loves to hear himself talk/write, which can also be a bit tiresome.On the plus side, his descriptions of life with a cat are apt and adorable, and I picked up a few new vocabulary words, and a little bit of history of the animal rights movement.So it wasn't a waste of time to read it, but I wouldn't do it again, or recommend it."
1,A good book? Think it again,"This book tries to teach you how to fix 170 different cameras in 150 pages. Is it possible? Let's cut off the intructions, safty advice, notes, index, table of connets and others, one camera only gets a half page's description at most. Do you think you can become an expert by getting this little help? When dealing with Canon AE-1, the author says: ""Remove the front cover as usual."" What usual? Where is the ""usual""? So far I have not been able to open my camera yet, but it can be a good thing because I am sure I will not able to put it back."
2,Broad and shallow.,Feel author has the technical knowledge but should focus on the common classics with enough detail for one to comprehend disassembly procedures. I've got every clock making tool available and I could not get the cover off the winder gear of an old common Cannon.
2,Tells you that you have a long way to go to do camera repair,The book offers a guide to what you will face in undertaking camera maintenance and repair work. It does not offer detailed procedures for the repair problems of specific camera design. You will be on your own which is only good if you have the making of a good camera repair person.In my opinion the book will not be helpful for the majority of readers who have dreams of doing serious camera repair work.
5,Un buen trabajo discografico,Creo que este trabajo refleja el cambio hacia la maduracion del artista. Son especialmente seductoras las canciones Bambu y Los chicos no lloran. Para todos los amantes de la buena musica.
3,"A good job, but far from his best.","This CD can disappoint the fans of Miguel Bosè, like me. It seems that the the CD was made very fast and without any concern about the sound quality, that is really bad in this album. The first 2 songs sounds like garage music, too bad for the best Spanish singer of all times. Well, nobody is perfect! If you are a fan like me, buy it!"
5,A Rhythm Record,"For me, this is a recording all about rhythms; challenging, dynamic, flowing polyrhythms. It's a joy to hear. The three musicians are certainly masters, playing into and out of one another with ease. The bass and drums create a solid foundation, strong without being overbearing, so Taborn can do his thing and swoop in and out with his percussive style in the higher range. Some of the tracks are actually just short sketches in sound, an idea explored for only a minute or two then set back down. The end result is a percussion heavy, atmospheric sound, missing much of the traditional melodic elements, but rich in rhythm. I highly recommend it to those listeners who enjoy the modern NYC downtown scene and Blue Series/Matthew Shipp et al. For those of you looking for a more traditional sound, it's best to look elsewhere."
3,...i gotta stop buyin erthang other people recommend...,"...this cd has its moments, but just as you settle down to enjoy one of them - BAM - they up and mess somethin up! taborn is talented as are the other two members in the trio, the only problem is that they do not play cohesively...on the majority of the songs, they all seem to be playin against each other and not together. it's omost like they overlapped 33 songs over 11 tracks (lissen to one, get two more free!)...i imagine them all colliding in the hallway on their way to the studio, sheets of music flyin up into the air and no-one taking the time to sort things out before they began recording....they do calm down some for the last 3 tracks, but gettin there was rough."
4,a great supplement for inflammation,"I've had Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis since my teens and over the years I have tried pretty much every prescription, OTC drug, and supplement in just about every permutation and combination possible. There are just a handful supplements that I have found that consistently work to help alleviate my symptoms of inflammation and Tumeric happens to be one of them.This Nature's Way brand works well for me."
1,Do not order from Direct Super Center,"I placed an order for this product. After a week or so of no indication it was shipped, I sent an email to Direct Super Center via Amazon's inquiry portal. I got no response. Several days later, I finally called them. They said it was slated for shipment the following week. Then, 17 days after the order was placed, I got an email saying it was still ""currently on back order."" It is STILL currently listed on Amazon as ""In Stock.""Stay away from ""Direct Super Center."""
2,NATURES WAY TUMERIC,"I COULDN'T TELL THAT IT DID ANYTHING FOR ME, AND WAS REALLY TOO EXPENSIVE. I WON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN"
4,honest review,"I ordered this brand as I had used it in the past and knew it was what it said it was. Also, the price was so much better than the stores. I have been using for about 3 months and find my inflamation in my hands has eased up. Will continue to use. Much better than prescription drugs."
3,Unsure,"I wish I could say with 100% certainty that this product has had a positive impact on my health. I take it for overall general health as well has to keep inflammation in my body down from allergies asthma. I have noticed a small difference, but I can't determine if it coincidence with the time of year for allergies or if it really worked. I am always looking for something that will definitively work, but this hasn't given me an answer. I will continue to take it for a couple more months and then stop to see if I notice a difference."
1,Contains Maltodextrin,"I recieved this ""premium"" product and read the ""other"" ingredients. I found one called ""Maltodextrin and went onto the web to get info on it. It seems that there are side affects such as bloating and headaches when taking any product with ""Maltodextrin"". So, back it goes to Amazon and hopefully back to Nature's Way. From now on I will not buy any products from Amazon until I see the ingedient list which, of course, was not on the description page for this product! Of course I will have to pay for shipping but that's okay because, hopefully, others will now know of this ""Maltodextrin"" and be smart enough to stay away from this product."
1,Terrible,"This book was a waste of money. Most of the stories were boring and poorly written. I got the impression that since there are so few writers on St. John, any local can get a book published if it has anything to do with the island."
3,Great Performance / Mediocre Recording,"Fans of Harold Land may want to pick this up as this live set recorded in Vancouver in 1958 is previously unissued and the quartet delivers a fine, hard-swinging performance. Unfortunately, the recording itself leaves a lot to be desired. Lonehill Jazz generally does a good job with vintage jazz reissues, but in this case the source material sounds thin and tinny. In fact, you can barely hear the bass player at all, which is a real shame, as what you CAN hear sounds great. If someone has bothered to remaster this and fix the acoustic balance by bringing up the lower frequencies, this would be a 4 to 5 star CD. But as it is, I can only give it 3 stars for excellent playing by the great Harold Land."
1,unlistenable sound quality; don't waste your money,"This is excellent music, performed by a top-notch quartet...but you can barely hear Elmo Hope, and you can't hear Scott LaFaro at all. Oh, well..."
4,Great music,Made me an instant fan of LCD Soundsystem. Recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys good music and great concerts
5,Interesting look into the end of a great band!,Great documentary/live show interspersed with fantastic interview snippets with James Murphy and chuck klosterman! Definitely worth getting just for the music alone! Highly recommended to both casual and hardcore fans.
4,Amazon Instant Video vs. Other Formats - runtimes NOT the same,A quick note to those considering the Amazon Instant Video purchase: check the runtimes and you will see the Instant Video is only 190 minutes while the Blu-Ray/DVD versions are 290 minutes. The physical versions contain the entire concert; the Instant Video is missing over THREE HOURS of content.
5,Tremendous . . .,"For anyone who moves to their music whenever they hear it, but has never seen them in action, this video is a ""must see."""
2,Yeesh,Goes to show never set your expectations high. I'm a huge LCD fan but i wish i hadn't seen this because it exposed a pompous self-promoting side to Murphy. Maybe i just had my expectations high that this would've had more footage that wasn't just contained in a small microcosm. No real story here just self-promotion or at least that's how i received it. I gave it 2 stars because their music still evokes emotion in me.
4,"So far, so good",So far so good. I bought this to use in an electronic music/laptop setup. It's been super convenient and sounds great.
4,The Best,"I totally love El Tri's music. I think they are one of the best bands ever put together. Ther have many wonderful CD's, but I think this one is there best one yet. The reason I totally love this CD is because of one song in particular, although all of their songs rock, the song being ""Triste Cancion"". That song has the power to make your mind go free. When ever I listen to it, it enables me to just relax and totally let my mind go , it sets me free, IT ROCKS!"
5,The battle with Raditzs continues!!!,"First off,this DVD is much better in presentation than the first one. The image is more consistent and there are a lot of fight scenes. It's a shame that it only has three episodes. Now for the audio, there are three options:spanish,japanese and, english. Up till now I've only heard the japanese track and it's okay. The english language track has stereo and 5.1 surround sound. This time around there are two menus: english and, suprisinly spanish. The only other thing that bothers me is that it doesn't have any special features like the featurrete from the first one. Thank god that it still as the trivia game. I'll make my review of vol.3 as soon as I get it. Up till next time, i'm off !@!!"
4,P. Hardy is an BAKA,"First off all the blood and stuff added into the uncut DBZ was in the original. I am stationed in Japan and have seen the original. Just like in Gundam Wing when it was eddited they changed all words and taken out the blood. Its nice to see DBZ the way its meant to be seen. Hopefully they will add all the uncut stuff to the rest of the DBZ series. I think its great that they have consistant voice actors and stuff. And the movies where uncut to a certain point but they where still missing a lot of stuff that was in the original. Which will make the movies a lot better just like when Gundam Wing Endless Waltz was realesed unedited it was great, it was really sad to see the carnege on cartoon network when they played endless waltz on it. I think Funimation is on the right track."
1,Not for the casual mixer,"This book is intended for real bartenders or individuals that know a lot more about mixing drinks than the average person who wants to mix a drink they heard of. The main chapters may be titled by main liquors but the recipes have no real organization. The indexes in the back are horrible. Under the index labeled ""Recipes by Style"" there's a heading for ""Dry"" which list the recipe for a Tequila Martini but not for the traditional Martini. Instead, I found the Dry Martini recipe in the index for ""Which drink for which occasion?"" and it wasn't listed the Alphabetical index either. I am donating my copy because it's not going to be beneficial to me."
1,Second rating...,This is the second time this item has come up for our rating. We sent this item back without any issue at all because it was not a described and we had no use for it the way it was. Thanks for the ease of the return!
4,The Musicriven,I Currently have a 3-year-old computer in my work office. Top of the line RAM 3 years ago is much different than today. Like most everyone I am sick of waiting and waiting for windows to load. So I set out to find Random access Memory upgrades. With these upgrades I would be able to open programs much faster and move through my compute much faster. When I came across Kingston 128MB RAM Module for Toshiba Satellite 2105CDS/1555CDS/2100CDS. Since that day my computers speed has increased 4 fold. Great Job Kingston!
3,Lacking in substance,I thought this book was ok but it's basically just an overview on the condition and treatment options and does not really provide a whole lot of information. It might be good for someone that was just diagnosed and wants a basic understanding of PCOS but I found it lacking in substance. I bought this book mainly to read about the homeopathic remedies that might help and it did provide me with the names of some herbs to look for but I didn't get much else out of it.
2,Expensive leader failed first day,"I purchased two of these leaders for a trip to the Boundary Waters. The swivel was an interesting design I had not seen before and was a little clumsy to use the first time, but it looked secure, so I was happy with it overall. After a few casts, I hooked into a nice pike and as it came close to the canoe, the line suddenly went slack. I pulled in my line expecting to to see the leader missing, but it was still there...the swivel had come open! For an expensive leader, I expected much more. This leader cost me $6, the lure was another $6, the fish was priceless, and now I had to spend the rest of the week minus one of my favorite lures."
3,un cd desparejo,"blades es uno de los grandes de la musica centroamericana, fuera de toda discusion. Sus canciones tienen ritmo, letras que reflejan la generalmente triste situacion de nuestra america latina y buenos arreglos. En este cd se combinan algunas destacadas ; buscando america, decisiones,el padre antonio con otras que no creo merezcan estar en una seleccion de este gran autor ; ojos de perro azul, sorpresas (fallida 2da parte de pedro navaja),. Es blades y los grandes como el no hacen cosas malas, solo algunas mejores que otras. Pero hay selecciones mejores, que reflejan adecuadamente su nivel musical, y que ademas cuentan con un nro un poco mas generosos de temas. creo que es solo para los pocos fans de blades que no tengan ya estos temas en otros cd, no me parece un cd de inicio, para conocerlo, porque llama a engaño"
5,classic,Great songs from a hanful of ruben blades albums smooth laidback jams with meaning good music grab this one for your lady
2,The cover didn't fit and was over priced.,"I bought a 14-15' Covercraft Technalon cover for my 1994 Dodge Stealth. It did not have pockets for side mirrors and ended up over a foot short of covering the sides of the vehicle. Moreover, the dangling, short cover would flap against the side of the vehicle in the wind. The stitching was coming out in at least one seam. I was disappointed and returned the cover. I bought a much better cover at Costco for $32 vs over $150 for the Cover Craft. The Costco cover was ample sized to fully cover the car, had a nice tie system at each end and the same 4 layer technology as the Covercraft. Should have done that in the first place."
5,get this video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this is the best video ever if you are an N.E. fan its the perfect combination of classic videos .buy this not that dvd i promise its worth its price i waited for a long time but once i got it i loved it.try and buy this wont regret it
5,CLASSIC NEW EDITION,"I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I RECEIVED MY PAST AND PRESENT TAPE IN THE MAIL I WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER AGIN IT TOOK ME BACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF WHEN MUSIC WAS FUN AND VIDEOS WERE EXCITING NOT THE SAME OLD HUM DRUM PRETTY WOMEN IN BATHING SUITS SHAKING AROUND , NEW EDITION IS A CLASSIC/CONTEMPORARY GROUP WHO WILL NEVER BE OUT OF STYLE JUST WATCHING THE GUYS GO FROM BOYS TO MEN IS TRULY A EXPERIENCE. IF YOU ARE A TRUE NE FAN YOU MUST OWN THIS TAPE"
4,"a pretty good movie, gloomy, dark and hopeless","the graffitti artworks were really amazing. what a sad and hopeless story. again, the majority americans are struggling while the politicians are bragging that america is the most powerful and the richest nation on the planet. all the roles were played wonderfully realistic and so naturally performed, a great achievment here. this is a movie turned out to be almost great but also very dark. i couldn't say i enjoyed it because it's a very sad story."
3,Thumbs Up,"Its pretty much a raw story of a graff writers life. Alot of graff writers deal with the same stuff this movies goes into. From cops, to beef, struggle and bombing.The movie is a little low budget but easy to see past that once it gets going. Has lots of bombing, good music and a decent story IMO. By the time your done with the movie im sure youll be glad you watched it, atleast once.its worth the 5 bucks... get it."
4,Same thing man!,Dude?! Same thing happened to me. I bought it from the movie's website and got deleted scenes and songs and stuff but my friend Gabe bought it from here and got the wack version. I don't even think that's a real picture of SF on the cover! Whatever this is a good movie but buy the RIGHT version. Peace like chickengrease.
2,"huh! well,",The first song on this cd is among the best trance up beat songs I have heard! The whole rest of this cd blows!
4,Well mixed trance album,"For this price, this disc is a great buy. Not only is the mixing superb, but the tracks are all really fun as well. The title is a little miseleading because there isn't really anything Deeper or Harder going on here, but compared to the last few awful albums put out by Ultra and Thrive, this is a gem."
1,terrible,"I have all of Johnny's mix CDs and not have I never complained, but loved everyone. Deeper & Harder is the worst CD I've heard in a long time. It's to slow and every song has singing in it. I don't mind singing, just not that much. I thought that with a title like that it was going to have great hard beats, but I was wrong. I don't recommend this CD, I'd wait for his next title to come out."
3,Jeffrey Morgan fan,any movie with him in it is great to watch for meSubject matter not too interesting to me to watch
2,Bad movie,"We liked to the actors, that's one of the reasons I brought the movie, but the movie kinda sucked. Poor plot, poor writing, poor direction. On top of that, i had to return the DVD because it was picilated, made it extremely hard to watch."
3,"Very Talented, But Dull","I very much enjoy The Sixteen, but it simply feels as though they phoned this album in. Being amazing singers, they can get away with this, but the fact of the matter is that this album is somewhat boring as they perform it. That's a shame: Byrd is some of the most beautiful music of the period, and the two masses in the album should be the works serving as jewels in the crown of an English choir specializing in early sacred polyphony.For comparison, listen to Byrd as performed by Oxford Camerata and Stile Antico. Oxford Camerata make the works earnest and haunting and very English, while Stile Antico is exciting and more floridly Italian in style. The Sixteen's work on this is simply not notable, and I can only hope they re-record the pieces included so as to properly reflect the group's ability."
3,Who chose these?,"Yeah, I know I had the chance to listen to the clips before buying, but they did not do justice to the music on this CD. If it is true that some of these were on the ""Top 10 Hit List"" of popular songs of the era, then I think we can not complain about the tastes of 21st Century pop music lovers. To think that kids were buying this stuff instead of the wealth of fantastic music being recorded in this era!That said, the historical value of the is CD is great. The Armstrongs and Mortons of the era must have cringed to think that their records were being overlooked in favor of Jolson, Astaire and Whispering Jack Smith. These indeed are rare recordings because later collectors undoubtedly passed them up so they probably are hard to find anywhere else today. Worth the money to play for those who say ""they don't make records today like they used to."""
4,CHARLESTON ERA,"THIS HAS DEFINETLY THE BEST REMASTERED VERSIONS OF THESE SONGS FROM THIS ERA. THE FRED AND ADELE ASTAIR SONG IS A RARE PRIZE.IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE LIGHTING UP A CHEASTERFIELD CIGARETTE AND POURING A LARGE COLD MARTINI. AND DANCING WITH A REAL HOT DAME AND SAYING ""OH! YOU KID.""THIS IS A VERY COOL COLLECTION."
1,product info,I use stevia packets for coffee and tea and I love it however the drops are not very good and do not recommend them
4,Makes great chocolate milk!,"Dieting means I don't get to enjoy a lot of my favorite foods. Chocolate milk is one thing I hadn't tasted in months and was resigned to forgoing for years. (I have a lot to lose.) But this chocolate stevia adds zero calories to the milk, and I really enjoyed the chocolate milk I made with it. It still isn't something I'll be able to drink often, as 1 cup of 1% milk is 110 calories by itself, but I'll at least be able to enjoy it occasionally.When reading any stevia product review, remember that people ""taste"" sweetness differently. Some people don't really taste stevia as sweet, while others find it *too* sweet. In addition, I noticed that some stevia products, like this one, were both flavorful and sweet, while others tasted (to me) like there was no sweetener in it."
4,Something different,"I bought this to use with the HCG diet - it makes you feel like you are actually getting chocolate. You do get the ""fake"" sweet aftertaste - but I think you do with most fake sugars. I added some to ice and ground up strawberries. It seems expensive but it is cheaper on Amazon than in grocery stores - and not all stores carry this flavor and brand. It also lasts a pretty long time. Better deal to buy 2 pack. Look at all the different choices to buy - some have free shipping some don't."
2,bitter,"I really wanted to like this, but it is difficult to get past the extremely bitter aftertaste. I was hoping to use it in my almond milk, but I don't think there is any way to disguise bitterness."
5,Taste like Cholocate Milk,"Sweetleaf Chocolate liquid Stevia is the best on the market. The flavor is amazing with no after taste. Adding drops in your water, coffee, or tea you would swear you were drinking chocolate milk......it's that good! The best of the Sweetleaf liquid flavors! I don't go anywhere without it!"
1,Horrendous,"This product was super expensive and I just couldn't overcome the horrible, lingering stevia taste at the end. I ended throwing it out."
3,not my taste,I still need to train my taste buds for these alternatives. It is sweet but not what I reach for.
1,choc drops,"idea sounded good, but terrible after taste left in your mouth. No refunds are available for this item, wasted money."
4,sort of chocolate flavored could be better though?,"You have to use a bit more than the recommended dose to have a sweet taste, but when you consider the alternatives, this is great stuff, and hard to find in stores, I think the big companies want Sweet leaf to have a hard time of it, so buying it here is Fantastic! and a good deal too!"
1,"New packaging, new bad taste","I've been using this product for years and loved it. Okay, I loved the dark chocolate more, but that seems to have been discontinued. I opened a new bottle this morning, the first with the white label and yuck! I couldn't figure out quite what it tasted like, but another reviewer mentioned raspberry and that's pretty close. However, it's not a very tasty raspberry, and that is not the flavor of choice for coffee.I see that the picture is still showing the green label. So I may try again, but if a white label shows up, I'm sending it back."
1,Aweful taste and should have retutned it.,"I was given sweetleaf choc but its a totally different taste than the usual one I buy from you and it says ""sweetdrops"" which I didn't ask for. I don't care for it at all. The packaging is different too which probably means the ingredients are different. Will not be ordering it again unless this is replaced with my usual. Sorry."
2,Insubstantial bio from a hanger-on,"Walker is a long-time close friend of Steve Martin, which certainly qualifies him to write a book of this sort, but unfortunately he seems more concerned with dropping his own name into the story at every turn than in illuminating Martin's life and work in any substantial way. Some of the facts of Steve Martin's early days are interesting, but the thread gets lost once Martin becomes famous. You can sense his (Martin's) moving beyond Walker's circle (probably for good reason), and a suggestion of Walker's need to hang on. There is a very interesting book waiting to be written about this gifted and brilliant comedian/actor/writer, but this is definitely not that book."
1,Buyer Beware,"After 50 pages is was apparent that this one trick pony should not have been allowed in the show. I know that's harsh, but fans will want more substance from a so-called insider who builds his effort around childhood pranks and high school clowning. His perceived present impressions of Martin are derived from 'dozens of letters' that are rarely if ever cited. Also difficult to read are the author's implied contributions to the development of Steve's talent with mock protestations of his own implication.A more focused approach would have presented the material only in the context of that time period instead the author writes with broad strokes and thus sacrifices credibility by claiming to have insight on the present Mr. Martin.There is a story here; it's just not presented well. No doubt, the author and Martin have a definite bond--one that would have made a nice photo essay for Vanity Fair.(Take away half a star for amateur publishing.)"
2,Not for everyone,"You will believe that Morris Walker was best buddies with Steve Martin for six years in school a long time ago. You will also agree that while Mr. Martin has made some very smart career decisions and been quite lucky, Mr. Walker has had the opposite experience. This is, at essence, an extremely honest and open book about two show business careers with wildly differing trajectories.The world is better that this book was written. The author is a gifted storyteller with a couple of dozen good tales to tell. His loving outlook on life will charm many people. It made me nostalgic for my own high school days, about 12 years after these two.Ultimately, however, I felt more uncomfortable than charmed, because Steve Martin has so clearly moved on from his high school days and comes across as patient and tolerant of his old friend's two-decade obsession with writing this book. I don't need to know about the author's sister's hookup with Steve. Too much sharing for my taste."
1,Illiterate Morons will love it!,"Sorry, but only a Steve Martin fanatic would enjoy this pathetic mess. These poorly written and structured antedotes from adolesence are extremely trite and stupid, and certainly come across as the embarrassing and boring prattle of an author who is desperate to associate himself with success. I can't believe these other reviewers who rave about this book - how based in reality could they possibly be. And what's with the editing of the book. Why didn't they correct the grammatical errors and the myriad spelling mistakes?! I've never seen such a sloppy job of publishing in my life! I'll certainly steer clear of this amateur publisher in the future. Good Grief!!!!!"
1,Pathetic. Leech-Like,"I've never seen such a perfect example of a childhood friend trying to exploit someone's success.Note to the author: you sir are a leech.This book is not funny. It lacks even basic structure. It is just sad.How could Amazon even agree to sell this rubbish?As a celebrity myself, I've actually given this to my famous friends as a guide and life lesson on choosing friends and the way it could haunt you later in life."
1,Didn't Finish,"I like biographies, I like Steve Martin. I love Disneyland and there are many references to Disneyland in this book. I am very patient about giving an author a chance and usually stubborn about seeing a book through to its end. I couldn't do it this time, though.This book is very poorly written and organized. The writing jumps around thematically and chronologically. Much of the writing is boring and some of it is truly cringe-worthy.I am sorry I gave this a try. I should have stopped much sooner."
1,Terrible,"This book is NOT about Steve Martin. It is written by a boyhood friend who figured out a way to make money on his friends success. It is childish,and offers nothing but silly stories about his time growing up with Steve. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!"
1,Horrifyingly BAD.,The only take-away from having ordered and read this book is that I am now able to definitively point to the single worst book in my home library.
3,An engaging mix here,"I bought this and Live @ Roxy 1 the same day, and between the two, this is the winner. The other one just plain sucked. It was generic and boring, and when i reviewed it i gave it one star. This one has much more substance to it. I was a little surprised though - I expected the first CD to thump and the 2nd to be more mellow, but here that's reversed. I found the first to be less energetic and a little more laid back. The second CD had a higher energy to it. I liked the tracks on both, especially the ones by Black Sun Project, Airmale, and Ballroom on CD 2. I probably won't be buying anymore of Rauhofer's CDs, but Essential Mix kept my purchases from being a complete waste. If you like this one though, I would recommend Steve Lawler (esp. Lights Out vol 1) and Saeed and Palash's Addictive Beats."
3,Days go by....,"Admittedly I purchased Essential Mix some time ago simply for the Dirty Vegas track ""Days gone by"" before it was re-released on the back of the Mitsubishi Car advert. For me, it was worth the money (and the wait) for that track alone. However, as a compilation over two CDs it tries to do too much. There are too many filler tracks, that let the whole feel of the mix down. Rauhofer would have done better to take the best from both to make a truly worth while single CD mix that you could listen to from start to finish without skipping."
2,Doesn't Hold Up Over Time,"Don't get me wrong, I think Rauhofer is tops in afterhours hard house and tribal but ""Essential Mix"" doesn't stand the test of time....its labored, drags on and won't stay in your top cd rotation. There aren't hidden gems on this one that you'll want to come back to in a month or so....if your looking for Rauhofer at his best, check out Live @ Roxy.....because live is where the man shines !! Either volume of Roxy Live (1 or 2) is vastly superior to this one !!"
1,Too dark,"I bought this album mainly because of the Dirty Vegas Song/ Days go by and expected a CD with the same upbeat, danceable sound. Unfortunately Dirty Vegas' song is the only good one on the entire album, the rest is very dark almost hardcore-techno like music. I am definitely disappointed."
3,Disappointment,Marian Anderson was my favorite as a youth but there was none of brilliance I remember on this CD.It seemed flat to me. Perhaps it was recorded from an old record with limited dynamic range. Anyway I'm giving the CD to Goodwill.
3,Marian Anderson,She does indeed have a pure soprana voice and she was my favorite when I was teenager but I guess I've lost interest over the years. I was bored with this album. Part of the problem might have been the recording itself which seemed a little flat to me.This isn't a kid's review.
1,Empty,"The only solid content in the book is contained in the title. The rest is a repetition of every new age platitude in current use. I have no problem with ""alternative"" thinking, but the rubber has to meet the road at some point, and it never does in this book. Enough time wasted on this sorry waste of paper."
4,"""A Star Trek tribute band? That'll never catch on, will it?""","ok, so it probably won't appeal to many non-star trek fans, but BGDOM in by far Warp 11's best album to date.They seem to have mellowed somewhat from the early days of Suck my Spock, and have taken inspiration from all over the rock world for their third album.I hear Tom Petty, Rage Against the Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, REM and more...It may have been over a year since the last album, but the quality makes it worth the wait.Seriously. It really is good listen."
5,gorgeous sink - feels and looks a high end product,bought 2 of these sinks for a bathroom remodel. My house was built in the early 40s and wanted something that had the classic retro look. OMG! They look gorgeous and are very practical. Buing very large they make washing easy and comfortable. And they look oh so high end. I love them!
2,Not for new users,"I bought this book about 3 months ago when I started a job as a systems administrator. The company I work for has a Linux server and it is my job to muddle through and hope it works. I don't know much about Linux so I bought this book. This book is not very explanitive even on the simple things. Example, I want to mount a cdrom and look for the way to do it. The book says to look at the enclosed How to on the cd-rom for information on the mounting cdroms.The book has several sections. The HOWTO basically gives an outline of the actual HOWTO. There is a section for FAQ's on the CD-rom but it only gives the most asked questions not the answer for that you have to be able to mount the cdrom."
2,Stock Market Crash of 1929 contributed to the great depression,"Although the stock market crash of 1929 did NOT DIRECTLY cause the great depression, it did contribute to it greatly. The banks that lent money to individual stock holders and invested in the stock market were incapable of lending money to companies. These companies started laying off workers and going bankrupt."
2,"I ordered because it was listed as seasons 3 , 4","I ordered because Barbara Stanwyck guest stars in those seasons, but Lorrettas family did not chose those eposides so I will try to sell it in a yard sale or online. Very disappointing."
3,where are all the guest hosts?,"Most of season 3 Lorette was sick in bed and had guest hosts who always ended with ""Good night, Loretta""These gems starred Irene Dunne, Rosalind Russell, Barbara Stanwick, Van Johnson, Ricardo Montalban, Joan Fontain, Claudette Colbert, and a few others.I would really like to see these, too. It's kind of funny, but none of these guest hosts were allowed to come in through her ""special Door."""
3,What can I say? It's a building code.,Not an easy read and often information is scattered about in such a way as to obfuscate what you need to know. But it doesn't matter what I think because we're all stuck with these codes. They get bigger and more complicated with every edition.
4,Uncritical guide to one of the most fascinating countries in the world,"This book helped me get started observing and questioning phenomena on my visits to Argentina. The coverage is introductory and the information just the very tip of the iceberg. There's a lot more to know, and while I have spent significant time there, it remains difficult for me to describe Argentina to others.Other than going to the country, I'd recommend watching every Argentine movie available. This book will help you to recognize what you're seeing, and the movies certainly give visual context and rich characters. Argentina is a long flight from the States, but a vacationer's dream in many respects. I couldn't help but fantasize myself living there."
4,Extremely useful pre-trip reading,"This is a useful and interesting book to read (or even peruse) if you are considering visiting Argentina. I recently returned from 9 days in Buenos Aires, and the book provided a good discussion of the country's culture, behavior and attitudes such that I felt that much more comfortable during my visit. My only adverse comment is that the author kind of over-romanticizes the subject matter a bit at times (although that is a result of an enthusiastic writer) and thus should be consulted in tandem with other materials on Argentina."
3,It wasn't for me,"Jim Harrison is a fine writer, I found this a bit hard to get through. It didn't pique my interest. It could have been when I read it, but it just didn't do it for me. It is a stark book. He is a middle aged man and farmer, he's having an emotionless affair with an 18 year old student from the school he taught at which has closed down. The affair fulfills what another woman he is having an affair with can not fulfill. His mother has just died, he seems to resent that he spent his younger years taking care of things and not his own wants. The writing is beautiful, I just couldn't muster up the care to like the story."
3,Interesting Soviet-era thriller undermined by plot,"One of the co-authors of ""Red Square"" -- buy it now, one of the best Soviet-era thrillers -- takes his own look at the rotten state of the Moscow hierarchy and the rampant corruption of the Kremlin elite at the height of the Cold War. The idea of maverick KGB and Foreign Trade Ministry officials trying to bring down the West on their own is tantalising but unfortunately the author doesn't quite manage to pull it off. The characterisation is weak at best and the ending dissolves needlessly into bloody murder and mayhem rather that probing the deeper implications of the plot."
4,Billy Straight,"Billy Straight is a thrilling, story that manages to carry two plots at once. Its about a 12 year old boy that runs away from his abusive home to the streets of L.A.. During one of these homeless nights in a L.A. park he witnesses the murder of women. The books turns in to a man hunt to find the killer of Lisa Ramsey, and the search for Billy Straight. The women murdered happens to be the ex-wife of a television celebrity, with a history of abuse. Billy soon come to the center of attention in the media, and begins to run for his life. This book will catch your attention at page one and keep you hooked till the end."
4,My first Johnathan Keller experience...WOW!,"I enjoy Kellerman's style of writing in this novel. Plot twists keep you guessing, and the POV transitions make for one of the most intresting and page-turning novels I have ever read. Keeping Billy in the first person POV forces the reader to focus on the novel's title character, while the backstory unfolds...introducing many mysterious and unforgettable characters. Kellerman brings some past characters in for cameo appearances. This is a must read for those who don't like predictable stories."
4,Made a fan out of me!,"My first Jonathon Kellerman book but will not be my last. I enjoyed every page & highly recommend it for easy, enjoyable reading."
2,Kellerman is better than this!,"I must confess I love Jonathon Kellerman's writing and I love his previous books. Alex Delaware, Milo Sturgis and Daniel Sharavi are such compelling charactors and the books (not including the last few) have always been top notch. But now it almost seems that Kellerman is sacrificing quality for quantity. Too many books in the past two years and none of them have been as good as his previous work. Kellerman is too good for that! If he takes two years to write this next one instead of dashing it off in a couple of months it would be so good! But ""Billy Straight,"" unfortunately, is not a very good read. It's too predictable, boring and the plot is so busy and full of uneccesary charactors and subplots that are never really resolved that we don't even care that they are left hanging. Jonathon Kellerman, I am your biggest fan! I know you can do better! I eagerly await your next book."
3,"Not his best, but ok.","I have read all of Kellerman's books, and found this one to be slow paced, with an ending that was definatly not a surprise. I didn't hate this book, but I certainly didn't stay up late reading."
3,"Not great, but pretty good.....","I enjoyed the book, but it took me two weeks to complete - I usually read a Kellerman in 3-4 days. I had a pretty good idea who the killer was, no big suprises there. I saw absolutely no reason for the character of Cora Adamson. Also, I felt that with the use of so many racially bigotted remarks by the various characters he was trying to make some point about racial harmony or something, and all the remarks about O.J. Simpson reinforced that (no question as to his opinion on that case!). It seemed somewhat unnecessary to the plotline."
2,Great Premise that Slowly Disolves to an Unsatisfying End,"Twelve-year-old Billy Straight has fled the chaos and abuse of his life at home and is fighting to survive on LA's meanest streets. Late one night he watches from his hiding place as a man viciously butchers a woman. The victim turns out to be the ex-wife of a television celebrity with a history of domestic violence. Billy becomes the center of terrifying attention--from the media, from violent bounty hunters, and from the murderer himself. As he runs for his life, relying on his native wit and instincts for survival, Billy is also tracked by a potential savior: Petra Connor, a tough, gifted, beautiful LAPD detective.Well, of course she's gifted and beautiful. Of course the murderer is cunning and manipulative, trying to implicate his best friend, his faithful protector as the true felon. Of course Billy is the long-lost grandson of a Hollywood matron. The story is predictable--and disappointing."
1,Kellerman should be ashamed,"I bought this book because I am a Kellerman fan and usually enjoy his work. This one is far below his usual quality! The characters are poorly developed and, by the end of the book, I really didn't care what happened to any of them. There are a bunch of contrived coincidences, which are simply ludicrous and insulting to the reader. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Not what I expected! Sorry JK,It started out interesting but got boring. I found myself wanting to skip chapters just to get back to Billy. He goes through hell and I couldn't wait for it to finish. I've read most of Jonathan Kellerman's book which have always kept me on edge but this one was disappointing. Besides the ending left me wondering. SORRY!
3,"Pretty good, but flawed","Billy Straight is probably the 5th or 6th Kellerman novel I've read and I'd have to say it's not one of my favorites. Overall, I enjoyed it but I thought it was a bit slow. As I was getting toward the end, I had to fight the temptation to skip to the last page and find out if I was right about who the killer was. I also thought the grandmother character was unnecessary. Her presence felt ""tacked on"" and contrived to give Billy someplace to go. I enjoy Kellerman's books enormously, but this one could have used a little editing."
4,quite entertaing and moving novel.,The main character detective Patra was a strong person who gave it her all. This book had some interesting concepts with an abusive boyfriend and a mother who had NO selfworth.Her son Billy Straight has more concepts of right and wrong then his mom.
2,"Go back to Alex Delaware, please!","I am a big fan of Jonathan Kellerman but was very disappointed with his last book, Billy Straight. The story dragged on and on to where I would stop reading from boredom. Please go back to what you do best , writing about Alex Delaware and his sidekick, Milo!"
5,Solid characters highlight a tensely developed story,"Having to not get my Alex Delaware fix this year, Billy Straight proved the skill of Jonathan Kellerman in developing charaters and weaving a wonderfully engaging story. True to form, you can visualize the charaters and the locations developed through skillful writing. I still miss Alex and Robin but was more than satisfied with the reading experience."
2,Who wrote this book?,I have read all of Kellerman's adult fiction novels and absolutely loved them. This book was boring compared to the others.
5,A MUST READ!,"J. Kellerman leads you on a roller coaster ride of twists and turns in his new novel Billy Straight. I could not put this book down. Each character is so detailed. Billy is a fantastic, brave, and yet vulnerable boy, and Petra is a strong willed leader with a very sensitive side -- both are characters I would like to see in future novels. The book is filled with detailed information only a child phycologist could right about. An added bonus was Alex Delaware's cameo role. A must read for J. Kellerman fans."
3,An experiment gone awry.,"I have read every one of J. Kellerman's books that have been published. I generally recommend them heartily. In every prior book, Mr. Kellerman exhibited a finely tuned writing style, combining psychological depth and characterization.When I read this book, I was genuinely puzzled. It seemed to be written by someone else. The shifting perspectives (back and forth from first person, Billy, to third person, Petra)gave the book a disjointed feel rather than building tension. Shifting writing styles seemed to pay homage to other mystery writers. I even wondered if his wife, Faye Kellerman, had written this book.The plot seemed somewhat disjointed yet predictable. It lacked the usual tightly woven threads of suspense and tension and ended with a whimper not a bang.I was especially curious as to why a woman who was allegedly disinterested in clothing (Petra Conner) was constantly citing clothing labels. It was very irritating. Maybe it was meant as a joke."
4,Engrossing psychological detective novel,"Australia leading the world in publishing?...about time! Kellerman's experiment narrating his story from the point of view of multiple characters (including a woman and a 12 year old boy) works marvelously in this engrossing multiple-murder detective story of highly intelligent street kid Billy Straight who has witnessed a shocking murder. Every time you think you've worked out ""whodunnit"", there's another clue or surprise to make you change your mind. The perfect light novel for a holiday read."
2,Has potential but falls flat,"Fine writing style, quite creative really, with good character development. But the story was a bit weak. The situations and resolutions were a bit too convenient. Flipping back and forth between the sub plots was ok, but they didn't cohere very well. Billy Staight's situation had little contribution in the end. The Ramsey investigation was small. What did Stu's character have to do with anything other than an attempt to show a considerate, domestic side of Petra. I really expected Stu to play a major role but he became unnecessary to the story. So some of the sub plots went nowhere. The Grandmother?Overall there was some real potential with this book but too many loose ends and lack of build up. However, I am really looking forward to starting on the Alex Delaware series. Looking forward to finding a character as strong as Sanford's Lucas Davenport."
2,Save your time and money on this one !,"Sorry to have to disagree, once again, with the majority of my fellow amateur reviewers, but I feel that not only was this book boring, but the author himself seemed bored and distracted. Plot hackneyed. Characters cardboard. Take the O.J. trial, add a bit of American Psycho, The Collector, The Client, and Nancy Drew and what you wind up with, stinks ! What a mish mosh. Stereotypes all over the place. Reading something like this reminds me why I generally prefer non-fiction and true crime. (And yes, I'm ashamed to admit that I read the whole thing. Hope springs eternal.)"
5,His best book yet,"What a tremendous story! The characters are so well-drawn, and the story just leaps forward. And there are no annoying loose ends. Congratulations yet again to a wonderful writer. I'm looking forward to seeing Petra in her third adventure."
1,Billy Straight,"I have read every book Jonathan Kellerman ever wrote. This was the most boring book of his I have ever read. He seems to ramble on and on. I did not like the way he wrote from both angles. His characters had no personalities, except for Billy and he wasn't written about enough. Sorry Jonathan...."
2,Too Many Plot Holes to Recommend,"I thought the premise of this novel sounded similar to Grisham's, The Client but I thought maybe Kellerman could craft a better novel out of the intriguing premise. Unfortunately, this novel, although much better written than The Client, covered much of the same territory and had many of the same shortcomings as that book. Billy Straight the character was well written and was by far the most believable character in the novel. Unfortunately, the murderer, whose thoughts and crimes become increasingly unbelievable made some deductions and guesses that put the Psychic Hotline to shame.The ending of the novel was so far fetched and improbable you'll be glad that you can move on to another author say Harlen Corben or Jeffrey Deaver who really know how to close the deal."
5,Jonathan Kellerman outdoes himself once again!,"I always enjoy his style of writing.Though very detailed, it captures the heart of the person he is describing. Case in point: Billy Straight. An abused boy from a disfunctional home, it zooms in on his moment to moment feelings as he struggles through the labryrinth of Los Angeles, trying to make all the right decisions to stay alive.Also, the Los Feliz area is one I am familiar with, so it it fun to read the details of libraries and schools that I see. I look forward to his next book. I always do!"
3,A disappointment from Jonathon Kellerman,"Being Jonathon Kellermans number one fan, I was very disappointed with Billy Straight. First off this book introduced a whole cast of new characters. For those of us who have grown fond of Alex and Milo - Petra and the rest on the group did not live up to previous books. I found the story moved slowly and there were too many characters with little or no description of who they were, what they believed in, where they came from etc. It was also missing the child psyc aspect which I have come to look forward to. I struggled to finish and unlike Kellermans other book - there wasn't a surprise ending - at least not for me"
4,Great read! Can't wait for further developments.,"While I still love Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis, I was really kind of glad that he brought out some new characters. At first, I didn't much care for Petra but as time wore on, I found myself warming up to her. (Note to Jonathan: next book, I'd like to see her self-confidence boosted from solving this one!)Billy Straight. I really found myself rooting for him! (Guess I was supposed to, huh?) I expect to see a lot more of him in future books. Perhaps teaming up with Alex and giving him a teen's perspective on whatever they're working on and maybe following in Alex's or Petra's footsteps. There's a lot of potential here!Great ending. Throughout the book, I found myself flip-flopping from one suspect back to the other, trying to cipher little clues which would reveal the culprit. Then WHAM!Keep it up. Don't retire Alex, but bring back Petra and Billy!"
2,What was he thinking?,"I expect more of Mr. Kellerman, the plot was thin, I know ""who done it"", there was no mystery, just some plodding, predictable detective work, characters seemed prediictable as well, hard working woman ""D"" , idiot boss, . . . I'm a fan, but this one left me cold, wanted to just get it done, and move on."
3,Kellerman pulls off a stunt. But why?,"About half-way through the book you suddenly realize what Jonathan Kellerman is really doing with ""Billy Straight"". (The title is a clue.) Because he is a superb writer, he does it well. The question is: ""Is it worth doing, at all?"" And the answer, especially when it means diffusing and prolonging a story beyond any reasonable bounds, is... sadly... not really. Jonathan, what the dickens made you do it?"
2,Jonathan Kellerman wrote this one? Read like a Faye K. book,Started off creating some new and intriguing characters with the detectives. Could have developed them a whole lot more. Why call this an Alex Delaware book when he is casually mentioned and hardly given a part? And Milo is briefly mentioned 2 times? The ending is rushed--did Jonathan really write this book? I expect a lot more from him--how about a re-write?
1,Don't bother,I have read all of Kellerman's books. This by far is one of the worst books I have ever read. Could not even finish the book. Please bring back Dr. D.
1,Lame,"A real no-brainer from Jonathan Kellerman. The plot was weak, and just barely enough to hold my attention. Oh, Jonathan tries to throw you off as to ""who dunnit"" but it becomes painfully obvious long before the end. Poor character development and a few chapters that made no sense until the end are interspersed here and there. And those chapters could have been left out completely. If you are looking for something interesting to read, look elsewhere."
1,Worst Kellerman Novel Yet,"This book was terrible, though some of Kellermans early Alex Delaware novels were actually quite good (When the Bough Breaks). Billy Straight is flawed almost from the beginning, the plot or mystery is a no brainer, the culprit is obviously one of two characters, and since you know that there is going to be a ""twist"" at the end, it is of course not the person that Kellerman tries to lead you to believe it is. In his more recent books Kellerman seems to have become some kind of an avenging angel, all of the ""bad guys"" in his books come to terrible ends, this time again, that are all too convenient. Plot aside, Kellerman indulges in every stereotype available, from the racist Russian to the kindly jewish grandfather. Petra, the central character is completely one dimensional. I wish Kellerman would not have tried to put himself in the place of a woman. Almost always when male writers try to do this the result is what you get here, completely unnatural."
5,Decorative and functional,Looks great; works great. It can be used in a casual or formal setting. Looks like 2 drops of mercury on our table. Very cool.
3,Monopoly Addict,"Unless you are a Monopoly addict or a Londonphile, the only good parts are the trivial knowledge that you pick up as you flip through the pages, e.g. who invented Cluedo, founder of Salvation Army; who is Gordon Selfridge, etc."
5,Awesome book for beginners and seasoned knitters alike!,My 11 year old received this as birthday gift. She has already done some knitting but this book is easy enough for her to understand and learn new things. I have been knitting a great number of years but have always stuck to fairly simple things. This book is so wonderful and I ready to be adventuresome and try something new!Highly recommend this book
4,Good book for knittters,"I found this book in my local library and deemed it worthy of buying. After not knitting for years, this book gave me detailed info and good pix on the basics and beyond. It has a good collection of different types of stitches and explains them well."
4,Great for Beginners,This book is great for beginners or someone looking for new stitches. The patterns aren't of high interest to me but the stitches will help me design my own stuff. Well organized and easy to find what I'm looking for.
5,excellent purchase,This book was a must for my color theory class and to have been able to purchase it at the price I bought it is amazing. The service were great!!
3,More about her journeys than the actual colors,"This is a book about writing a book about colors. The actual color information often gets lost in the oh-so-charming stories of how she researched the information. The author has a fine eye for the ""telling detail."" And often that's all you get - a string of telling details, without a backbone. And when she wanders off into ""I like to imagine that..."" I just want to throw the book across the room.I think it's a fantastic idea for a book. And if it had more substance and less chatter, it would be a fantastic book."
3,Color: A Natural History of the Palette,"The history information was interesting, but the book was too long. Her personal experiences added to the story and helped to get through the book. This was chosen for a book club by the hostess, who liked the title and cover."
5,reading with computer by my side,"Love love, love this book; traveling with the author via computer, seeing ancient art in the Alps and ochre mines in Australia. The computer research is adding a depth as I see what she is talking about - i.e. Van Gogh's paintings of Tanguy, how they changed when he started using more vivid colors. My world is expanding as I read this book."
4,Lapis and Travel to Afghanistan,"I have not yet read or purchased this book, but I have to make a small comment about the editorial published on this page. Ms. Finlay was certainly not the first woman to visit the Lapis Lazuli mines in Afghanistan. They are the most famous mines of Lapis in the world, and have been studied by many women, in fact. Dr. Georgina Herrmann visited the mines with the Oxford University Expedition to Afghanistan in 1964. While there her team inspected the mines, collaborated with the Afghan Ministry of Mines and Industries, and were allowed to take samples back to Oxford. Dr. Herrmann wrote her PHD dissertation about the sources and use of lapis lazuli and subsequently published several artilcles on her findings. I believe that Dr. Michele Casanova (another woman) may have also visited the mines more recently while working up her PHD dissertation in France."
5,Awesome and useful,I use some of the fun facts from this book in the oil painting class I teach. A very entertaining and educational travelogue. I really enjoyed how the author tied different narrative threads together.
5,Journey of colors,"This is a marvelous book. It is a page turner. In addition to being well-written and deeply researched, it is filled with wonderful stories that take you backwards and forward in time and place. You may want to keep an atlas nearby for reference. It is difficult to write a review that is as engaging as this book."
2,Too much chaff mixed with the grain,This book is more of a travelogue on the author's journeys to locations where pigments originated than a factual historical textbook. The tidbits of information on the history of pigments is heavily diluted by a great deal of lengthy side stories and I found myself trying to wade through to get to factual information of value. While much of the book is very interesting it could use a great deal of editing ... at least about 100 pages less.
2,Surprisingly boring. Not too well written.,"I am very interested in the subject of pigments and color and was disappointed at how tedious this book is. I'm not interested in the characters she meets in her travels. I'm not interested in her fantasies about what ancient people might have been like (or what their love life was like!).I want to know about the history of pigments and paints. I want to know how one sort of pigment gave way to another or how it was improved or even how tastes shifted from one favorite to another...advantages and disadvantages of different pigments. This book has some of that (buried in travel anecdotes), but when those sorts of topics come up, she quotes ""The Art Forgers Handbook"" again and again. Seems like that's the book I really wanted."
2,Frustrating read,"This is such a lovely idea for a book, yet one completely squandered by Ms. Finlay. There are certainly enough fragments of stories and histories to keep the curious reader engaged, but many more moments where I was disappointed by the lack of intellectual rigour or thoughtful analysis. I've had to stop reading several times out of sheer frustration with the presentation; I too have been tempted to throw the book across a crowded subway everytime the author utilises the inelegant conceit of ""I'd like to imagine...""."
5,"Carol Lyons reviews ""Color""","""Color"" by Victoria Finlay is a fascinating investigation of color, packed with information, stories, and anecdotes. One example of the historic mysteries of color is the chapter about orange. This is a surprising book for anyone curious, who may or may not be an artist."
3,A review by a non-painter,"Painting is definitely an artistic endeavor, but did you ever wonder where painters get their materials from? The watercolors, the acrylics, the oils. What materials go into making a color a certain color, how does one know it'll remain that color throughout years and centuries? This is a very well-written account of the author's travels all over the world to learn the stories of the pigments. It'll take your thoughts in directions they probably haven't been before, unless you're an artist yourself (I'm not), in which case you'll love it as a reference work filled with information you didn't know. And stories. The author's a journalist by trade, so she finds interesting stories."
5,Pefect!,"I loved this book and hated to see it end. It's part history, part art, part anthropology, and part travelogue and just a perfect read if you have an interest in any or all these subjects.Findley's style is breezy but informative. The one chapter that got a little slow was the one on the violin/orange but then if you were a musician it might be just the right chapter!"
1,Waste of time and money,The author is apparently born to money (at least she writes that way) but thinks she understands the aboriginal mind. Please.
5,Side steps,"The items was a perfect fit. easy to install with existing holes, no drilling, installed in less than half hour with standard tools. Item arrived quickly and in perfect shape.I would highly recommend this product."
1,Think about spending a little more money,"Mine worked for 2 minutes after first receiving it, then it never worked again, so I returned it. The stylus is like a plastic tooth pick and I think this company was being just a little too ambitious thinking they could make an organizer this small and make it reliable. I decided to spend more money to buy a real PDA and splurged on the Handspring Visor Platinum. You might want to consider the same move."
3,Okay product for the price,It's simply basic but if those are just the features you need then it's being sold at a good price. The small size is a bonus!
1,Echo is NOT back lit.,"Well I only ordered this pda from amazon, b/c it was $9.99 and b/c it was backlit. The description says back lit and it's not back lit at all. So now I have 2 pda's that are not back lit... Also, the cost was 9.99 but by the time they added shipping the thing cost almost $20 bucks to get here from amazon. Finally, if I ship it back b/c it isn't back lit at all, then I lose my shipping charges, plus the shipping back charges... So I might as well just keep it, and wonder what to do with it..."
3,"Ok, but no star","I'm an 11 year old who loses track of the papers that I write my notes on, I bought this when we had to make a project to show the whole school, it worked great until I needed to save a lot of information on it, it said I couldn't save more than 100 words, knew this but it was very annoying. Don't get me wrong, this is a good tiny little computer and it works great until you need to save a lot of data. This is great if you need just to jot down reminders or remember dates but don't get this if you have to save a bit of data."
1,Mediocre organizer,"The screen has very low resolution, low quality, hard to see the text from most angles.The software bundled to download your contacts from PC is terrible, if you want to download your outlook contacts, you have to first save them as text, then use the bundled software to download.I have an old REX organizer, works much better than this even though there's no way to enter info with my old REX, you can transfer all the info from outlook with one click.I can recommend echo only as a cheap toy."
3,Good basic info but didn't realise it was so outdated.,"Book is outdated (not even written in the 21st century so some of the information may not even apply to now). Also, would have been better if it had colour pictures instead of black and white. But there is some useful information that is timeless."
5,REPLACEMENT,"I PURCHASED NEW SLIDING MIRRORED DOORS FROM HOME DEPOT. THEY CAME WITH THIN (CHEAP) HANDLES. SO I SEARCHED ON AMAZON,FOUND THESE HANDLES. THESE ARE THICKER AND HAVE A BEVEL THAT MATCH THE SLIDING DOORS. SATISFIED. MAYBE THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE DOORS SHOULD UPGRADE TO THESE. THEY WOULD BE DOING THERE CUSTOMERS A SERVICE."
4,money talks,"If you like Jon Landau after reading this book, there could be something wrong with you. Not only did he have a hand in producing one of the most egregiously muted rock records of all time (the MC5's Back in the USA), he was a definitive driving force behind the corporate side of music. He's not the only slimey piece of work involved in this book, there are many.There's no question that Landau made a lot of money for a lot of people (including himself), as did all the 'buisnessmen' in this book, the problem I have is that they cannot be considered music fans. If they are at all, it's a distant second to their love of money. A good book that's worth reading."
2,Good story about business...bad story about music,"The book was a great summary about the history of business and popular music in the last 30 years or so. Unfortunately, I was hoping for some more information on the actual artists: Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, etc."
3,hard to read,"This is a good book, but a little bit hard to read, due mainly to the small type lettering and a confusion of names, places, dates and bands that just doesn't seem to go together to make some point !!"
5,Underated,"Most underated book about rock history. This guy tells it like it really happened. Prepare to have your little rock heroes bashed around a bit, possibly. No punches pulled, the real story is told here, filling in the blanks to the history of rock. This will really help you understand why you were listening to that lamo junk music on the radio when Led Zeppelin II was collecting dust!"
1,Hater,The book is an endless mean spirited attack on people the author doesn't like. There must be something personal going on here that we're not being told about by the author. A none too subtle hatchet job.
2,Boring,"This book was a difficult page turner that seriously lacked in the entertaining department for me.I found the author's ""dryness"" to be plainly and simply ""dull""It all just seemed to be a little far fetched, thrown together with no real emphasis on scene setting nor ending."
4,Dark Brown - won't hold the thick long bath towels or coats,This is more dark brown than bronze like my other bathroom items. It is smaller than I imagined and will hold my thinner bath towels but probably wouldn't work well for the thicker extra long bath towels or thick coats unless they have a coat tab. Since I don't like thick towels it will work for me. I also keep a small jar of bronze paint that I can touch this up with and then it will match the more bronzey items that I already have.
3,Quality ok but tt's small,"This looks like the picture where shape and quality are concerned, but it is alot smaller than I expected. Maybe half the size. That's probably my fault for not reading the details before purchasing and absorbing/visualizing the measurements. I've seen similar products at Home Depot and would imagine it would be worth looking there and possbily saving a dollar given this is fairly small for the asking price.There's nothing special about the deal being offered here. I would like to see a 3 pack for a reduced price."
3,small hook,This hook was smaller then I expected (but true to size measurments) however the return process was easy (- the hefty cost).
3,Liberty Hardware B4230J-VBR,"Hook looks good - just as presented on site. Concerned that the hook will not take much weight or be durable as it has some movement when you press on the hooks. Hook is welded to the circular piece so it doesn't inspire much confidence that I won't be looking for new hooks down the road. I have seen other hooks that screw into the base unit, they were too big for my purposes."
4,good product,"hooks are well made and high quality. smaller than we expected but overall a good buy. Shipping was fast. Overall, I couldn't beat this purchase anywhere."
3,Gorgeous but not for heavy items,I have to replace 2 of the 4 liberty hooks because the hook part fell off. I hung 3 winter jackets on one and a purse on the other. Bummer. I guess I have to limit the load on these. They are not as durable as the one piece designs.
3,lacks emotion,"I love the Canadian Brass' recording of J.S. Bach's Art of the Fugue, however I am disappointed by their recording of the Goldberg Variations. I admit to being prejudiced by Murray Perahia's Goldberg Variations on piano. However, playing variations 26-30 side-by-side, and there is no comparision between Perahia and the Canadian Brass. The vibrant emotion expressed in Perahia's playing is absent in the brass rendition. The latter just makes me think I'm stuck in church while the former grabs me by the collar and moves me."
3,Families and change coping with stressful events,Book was bought for my daughter to use at school.is new and in good shape.hope she uses it well at school
4,Another good one...,"I love the Jack Styweck series. I haven't read any other books by James Grippando, but I've read all in this series: THE PARDON, BEYOND SUSPICION, LAST TO DIE, HEAR NO EVIL and the latest, GOT THE LOOK. My favorite part of each book is Jack's friendship with Theo, an ex-con he represented and got released from death row years before. The banter between these two characters is always enjoyable and it provides a bit of comic relief to otherwise serious, dark stories. In GOT THE LOOK, there were a few parts that I felt dragged a little, but nothing that tempted me to put the book down. I've read all of John Grisham's books and if I have to choose between the two, I'll pick a Grippando book every time."
2,got the look,"I have read all his books and usually love them. This was clearly not up to par. I had difficulty getting through this book from the very start. It finally began to pick up toward the very end but by then it was too late. Also, I think it's time for a new character. I like Jack and Theo, but they're getting boring."
3,Wish it had the look,"Having read all but one of Mr. Grippando's novels I have to say this was not one of the best. It has plenty of twists and turns and Florida is a good swamp to have a story located but it just did not hit me where it should have. The best part of all is Theo and his statements of wisdom throughout the novel. I can understand it must be difficult after this many novels to come up with a real good one but take some time and think another good one out without rushing, tell that to the Publisher. Good luck on the next one."
3,Average,"I have pretty much always enjoyed everything by this author. So, why the three stars?I don't know why authors don't figure out (when they are writing thrillers) that they have to write an opening chapter that will ""grab you"". I think this was my problem with this book.While it was not bad, it never kept me all that interested either. I have come to expect almost non-stop action from Grippando and it was not really happening here. Sure, there were moments of action, but somehow even these can feel subdued.A great example is the opening chapter when they are ""looking"" for somebody who is supposedly buried under water. The author takes so much time with the characters introspective comments, that it removed from when they actually got to the action of having found a body in the watery grave.Yes, the writing is good and the characters are believable, but I think the author needs to get away from so much ""insights"" for his characters and remember that he is writing thrillers."
4,Page-Turning Thriller,"This is a riveting page-turner with lots of twists, great dialogue, and some excellent action pieces. The Jack Swyteck series is an underrated one, but one that usually delivers solid entertainment, just like this entry does.Suffice it to say that like all thrillers, there are a few too many coincidences to believe, but that is a common fault of the genre.Recommended."
3,Not his best..,"I've been a fan of James Grippando's novels for years, but I have to agree with the others who say GOT THE LOOK wasn't his best work.It's not a bad story, and I'm not saying don't read it, but the one thing that gives me a hint about how much I will enjoy a book is the opening chapter because I agree with T. Avon who stated ""they have to write an opening that will grab you!"" This one didn't do that for me either, and it's just not the usual non stop action and suspense that I'm so used to from this author. His characters are still believable, and I simply love Jack Swyteck and his sidekick Theo, but I was somewhat disappointed so had to give it only three stars. Maybe next time......"
3,Intriguing characters amidst a long-drawn-out plot,"Jack Swyteck, a lawyer falls in love with a mysterious woman names Mia. He discovers that she is married to another. He works hard at forgetting how much she meant to him but cannot when Mia is kidnapped. The kidnapper wants her husband to pay him ""what's she's worth."" It is quickly headline news that Jack and Mia were having an affair. Risking everything Jack gets involved when Mia's husband will barely meet the demands. The FBI gets involved, with Andie Henning as their enigmatic leader. You won't learn the whole story behind many of the characters. The plot at times feels like it will never end. At the same time, it leaves you wanting to know more of what happens to Jack, Theo, and Andie Henning."
4,Overall Good Story,This book wasnt bad and was my first Gripando novel. I do think the opening chapter could have had a better hook. Also i dont think that jack and theo make realistic friends. But still a good story thatll keep u guessing. I think ill try his other books.
5,It Struck a Chord With An Adopted Child,"Bill Peet's THE WHINGDINGDILLY was our very ""unbookish"" oldest son's favorite book as a child. At age four he wanted my wife or me to read it to him over and over again. (And he enjoyed pronouncing the title of the book when he asked.) By age six or seven he was reading it to himself and his younger brother. To him there was something absolutely captivating about it. My theory is that, because our oldest son was adopted, from an early age he had unverbalized concerns about his identity. And THE WHINGDINGDILLY is about identity, and being happy with who you are. This child is now 31 and recently had the pleasure of introducing his older daughter to this great book (a present from her grandparents!)."
1,signal problems,"This is one of the worst wireless systems I have ever used/purchased. I purchased this to use with my high school music program, but there was so much static, interference, white noise, lost signals, etc. that is unusable. I even returned it to VocoPro for a replacement, hoping the one I got was defective. The replacement was just as bad. Even after placing the reciever less than 10 feet from the microphones, the problems persisted. To make matters worse, AA Duracell batteries do not fit. They are slightly longer than generic AA batteries, but the added length is too much for the unusally small tollerences in the battery compartment. Even generic batteries have to be forced in place. I ended up installing it in our theater for our administrators to use during staff meetings because no one seems to mind when they cannot understand or hear them talk. Do not waste your money."
3,Received as described,I bought these equipment as a gift to a church. Feedback received recently said that the mics are working perfectly.
5,Best option for the money!,I checked around at my local truck shops to see how much soft and hard covers cost and I was shocked to find out that they started at $900! The TruXedo was way cheaper and easy enough to put on my 03' F-150 SuperCrew. I like the option to roll the cover up on days I need larger items in the truck bed rather than remove and then replace a hard cover. Great buy!
5,"""Coolisimo""","This album left me in shock. I honestly did not think I would get so attached to one group. Before I never would have pictured myself listening to this type of music, but with one listen of this band opened my ears to another level of music. Trust me, you wont be disappointed if you buy this album, it ROCKS!"
4,la secu 23,introduces us to the many moods of the tacubitos. fun lyrics and music. how desperate of attention would you be to try to drown yourself en el excusado?
3,"Same song, different CD","The new stuff on this album is fantastic! Pat is so talented that it's great to have new tunes to memorize. Unfortunately, I was ahead of the game this time, because 6 of the 13 songs were on his last CD, ""Carry On"". They were much better this first time around. I recommend this for the new songs, but I think ""Carry On"" is a better investment."
5,Read this If you Have never heard of Pat Green,I have been listening to Pat Green for 4 years. I have all his CD's and this one is his best. It is a little slower than his older one's but it is just an amazing set of tunes. It has a few older songs of is that he has redone and they sound awesome too. Long live Pat Green the new king of country. We'll catch ya on the Flipside Garth.
5,Pat Green Is The Best Out There!!,Pat Green's new CD Three Days is the one of the best yet from Pat. If you have never listened to Pat Green you are missing out. If you like country that isn't like any other then you will love this CD. I suggest that you buy it right away.
5,Pat Green Rules,"If you haven't heard of Pat Green, you will. If you have, and you don't know how great he is, you will. Three Days is an album almost entirely of past releases, but is a great compilation for both new listeners and long time fans alike! This is just another stepping stone in taking back country music to the way it is supposed to be! Three Days is a must have...it has been playing nonstop since I got it!"
5,Tx. music rocks!,"Carry on man! This is a great cd for those of y'all who don't already have it. It's a must for your Pat Green collection. I've had the pleasure of checking Pat out several times and that dude is awesome. Great cd to play over and over! My favorite is ""Take Me Out to A Dancehall and ""Crazy"". I can't say it enough Pat is awesome!!! He's finally getting the recognition he deserves. Not only is he a great performer, singer, but he's a great songwriter. Ajuaaaa!Keep on rockin' that Tx. music!"
3,An ok CD.,"This CD has some great music, and Pat's voice is so unique, however, the lyrics...well they get old. It almost sounds like the same song being sung 10 times. There are only so many drinking songs I can listen to before I reach for something else."
1,Terrible,"This book is terrible. It is poorly written, melodramatic, pretentious and preachy, and it is full of cliches."
2,OK is all I can say.,"I thought since this was ""Tool Exchange"" that I might be getting a good quality, resharpened American made bit.And it would be close to the size I really wanted.Turns out it is the same Chinese bit you could get at Harbor Freight or elsewhere.(Of course a fractional bit this size you might not find there).So what can I say. It's Chinese and you get what you pay for.I bought a Champion at Amazon after this one that I did use for my project. I could see the US stamping on that one in the picture. It was just 32nd inch larger.It cost more."
4,"Bostitch SX50351-3/16G 1-3/16-Inch by 18 Gauge by 7/32-Inch Crown Finish Staple (3,000 per Box)","Bostitch fastners are great products; however, this shipment arrived with the box's contents disgorged into the packaging resulting in the fragmenting of approximately 40% of the clips. As another reviewer has suggested, far better if the box ends are taped with a durable tape prior to shipping.Amazon did extent a partial credit to compensate for the damaged goods."
4,Weber Spirit pretty good,Solidly built - nice designNot too difficult to assemble - directions not the best (my pet peeve)The only thing I don't like about the grill is that you can't really see the flame. Sometimes that's important. Overall pretty nice piece of hardware. And finally I own a grill that has a working thermometer.
2,Disapointed,"Bought this yesterday, so haven't been able to assess long term durability. However I am very displeased with the flimsy sheet metal porcelain coated grates. Overall build quality appears mediocre. Temperature does not get much above 200 degrees C even on max. I was suckered in because of the Weber name. Never again."
3,Not real easy to assemble,"This wasn't the easiest product to assemble, and I'm an engineer. We don't like the concentric burners, which makes it harder to do indirect cooking, especially if you want to use a grill wok on one side and do meat on the other.Delivery was inconvenient. We would have had to be at home between 10 and 3 to get it on a weekday. We ended up going to the warehouse to pick it up.Lights easily and we like the gas gauge."
4,HOT,"This is an excellent grill. THe thing I like about it most is the temperatures it reaches. Never had a grill be able to get up to just under 600 degrees. I have only used it a couple of times, but so far have not noticed any cool spots on the grill. Its pretty much the same temperature throughout the entire surface which is really nice. Only reason I gave it a 4 was because of the side table on the left of the grill is pretty cheap. It didnt snap into anything and can be just pulled right off, however unless you pull it off it will stay in place."
4,Not bad.....,"I bought our Weber from Lowes and the cover from Amazon. We had owned a Genesis model for over 20 years and I gave it away when we moved. It was still functional but we wanted a new one. Of course we got sticker shock when we saw the prices. We are very pleased our purchase and it was already assembled. The manual is really lousy, though. It doesn't even tell you what the symbols on the burners mean. Of course you don't have to be a mental giant to figure them out. Glad I didn't have to assemble mine using the manual. It does seem to cook just as well as our old one ( which now costs over $700). The grill is not as heavy but works just fine for us. Getting the cover is a good idea and ours should be here any day now."
3,Dead Mary,"I thought after reading the reviews, this might be good, it was ok. It sounds good, several friends go to a cabin for a weekend, play a weird game, and turn into demons. The best and most effective part of the film was not the acting, or the effects. It was when, late at night, they're bored, sitting around the cabin, drinking, and start talking about Dead Mary and decide to see if they can summon her, none actually believing they can do it. For a while there, the movie was scary."
3,Not too bad,"You know what it's all about so I'll get to the point. It's not so bad, the acting doesn't suck and it does have gore factor and scare. I wasn't fascinated, but it held my attention. I have definitely seen worse!"
1,Where's Dead Mary?,"Don't judge a DVD by its cover...I wanted to see the scary monster on the front cover of this DVD and all you get is a girl with gumball machine false teeth! The movie was slow and if you didn't pay attention in the begining certain things that are told in the movie won't make sense.Don't buy this don't rent it, just enjoy the cover art cause that's the best part about this movie."
4,INTERESTING LITTLE MOVIE,"This movie is really weird (emphasis on ""REALLY""). But I think it was a pretty good and interesting little low-budget b-horror film. If you are the kind of person who doesn't really like scary, gory, low-budget, and slightly awkward horror movies, than you should get as far away from this as possible. But if you do like movies like this, than you should give it a try (sorry if I am not being specific enough)and maybe you'll like it. I know I liked it.The End."
1,Bit of a Yawner,"I actually fell asleep through most of this movie but the general gist is nothing more than what it says...the kids say Dead Mary in the mirror...then they all die.Frat Party stuff, borrow someone elses copy don't buy it!"
2,Beware of Issues,"A beautiful looking piece that matches perfectly with the Franke stainless steel sink I purchased. However, a few things to beware of as a consumer:- The unit looks like it stainless steel, but its actually coated in a very thin plastic, so when I put a hot pot from the stove on it (thinking it was just metal) it totally melted and ruined the plastic and now I am stuck with a messy looking melted grid.- Mold & mildew seems to collect in all of the small corners of the squares of the grid creating an unsightly blackened moldy, messy grid. It is impossible to clean this by hand or with spray cleaners. Every few months I must plug & fill the sink with a bleach and water solution and soak the grates to kill the mold."
5,Musica Navidena con Sabor!!!!,"All the songs on the album are songs you have heard growing up during the holidays, with very good musical compostion. I live so far from where I grew up that when I listen to this album during the holidays, it lets me know that it's christmas, new years and it's time to celebrate with those close to you."
3,pretty average,"Mr. Cheeks has some good rhyming ability but overall i would say this solo album is just average. A few of the songs are good, but nowadays people will just download what they like and delete the rest. I recommend you all try before you buy this one."
5,Fabulous!! You must buy this book!,"For people who have never had an appetite for the kitchen, this book is so wonderful! It tells you how to put your kitchen together, what basics you need and it's everything you can find at a mainstream grocery store as well as healthfood stores.I have a bunch of cookbooks and it seems that even when you follow the directions to the last drop, it almost never seems to turn out right. I have not had that experience with this book AT ALL and the dishes I have tried are absolutely delicious. I never knew cooking without everything we are so used to (dairy and meat) could taste this good. You will be in for a treat with this one and I can't wait to buy copies for my friends!"
4,Great for would-be vegetarians.,"Great cook book with delicious recipes and easy to follow directions. I am giving it four stars because it tends to go on about ingredients and health benefits so there are relatively few recipes. (The ""101"" is a little bit deceptive because quite a few are extremely basic sauces and dressings, not meals.) If you are already a vegetarian this recipe book may be disappointing. On the other hand, this is the perfect book for anyone who is not yet a vegetarian but would like to be."
2,Not So Great,"I bought this because my boyfriend is a vegetarian and decided to try to cook more for him. However, these recipes are not very quick. They are difficult and very complicated. Great for people who want to make a very elaborite meal, but not great for people on the go."
2,Didn't earn a place on my cookbook shelf...,"I found the recipes in this book uninspiring, the preparation not even close to quick or easy and just plain not useful. The photographs, however, are beautiful."
3,Helpful,This book was not exactly what I was expecting but it has been very helpful for a newby at vegetarian eating.
5,Well-paced and whimsical,"Aiken is in top form in this (sadly) out-of-print children's novel. Felix, the main character, is engaging without being perfect; the minor characters are drawn with an eye to the amusing improbable detail. As usual, the plot is wild and rapid, but the pace is steady enough to make it all feel satisfyingly real . . . The trilogy (Go Saddle the Sea, Bridle the Wind, In the Teeth of the Gale) shares many stylistic characteristics with her other alternate history series, which begins with The Wolves of Willoughby Chase. In some ways these three books are even better, being a little slower and more coherent as a single narrative. Of side interest to Austen fans is Aiken's use of _Lady Susan_, which appears occasionally throughout the story. I won't spoil the details, but the series makes a nice companion read."
4,good artist!,"this album was a pure joy to listen to. the first kashif song i ever heard was 1983's lover(turn me on). i thought at the time. ""what a musician"". kashif's other popular songs are represented here as well such as ""stone love"" and ""reservations for two"" a duet with dianne warwick. kashif not only sold his own music but, was also instrumental in the success of music from m'eissa morgan and evelyn ""champagene"" king. i don't think that kashif ever let success get to his head. i think he realized that his success was just a fleating thing. today, i understand, he has been a proffesor as well as holding his own at being a ""musicians"" musician and offering up software for the music industry and providing guidence for up and coming musicians and talent through his site [...]. whatever he is doing today ""music from my mind"" is definatly worth a listen. in my book he is the greatest, most influencial artist of his time period."
5,Cappuccino Cocktails,"Awesome! This book will get you hooked on coffee if you aren't already. There is background information on growing, harvesting, and roasting along with wonderful recipes. Very helpful even if you don't have an expresso machine. You will find directions on how to make coffee drinks without the machine. Well worth the price."
2,A cheap book...,"Zimmer's book presents a nice introduction into coffee, but nothing more. As a coffee enthusiast, I was dissappointed on the information provided by the book. There was no deep insight or extensive experience behind the writing. Same kind of introduction is easily available by surfing coffee related web sites. This is true also for the recipes listed in the book.What really bothered was the cheap way the book was put together. Instead of proper writing the content was presented in the form of notes ie. list of facts. Combined with really poor layout and typography the overall impression was of a junior high school project work. I really don't think this book adds anything to the wonderful world of specialty coffee."
3,Still Waiting for more results,Have been using the cream for about a month and have seen a slight change in my complexion. I am still hoping I will get better results in the coming months. I will keep you posted. Kathy
4,eb5 Facial Cream,"I like this cream, but the only problem I have with it is its ability to make me sweat my makeup off. I put on a light coating under my makeup and it makes my foundation roll off. Its a great moisturizer, I use it at night, and on my neck. I dont recommend using under your foundation unless you have extremely dry skin. It is completely skin friendly though and non-irritating. Also, fragrance free, which is hard to find."
1,bad cream. Don't waste your money,I have used this cream for few months. No change at all. I got small pimples where I used it. I think it's a waste of money.
3,"Michael, about your comments...","I'm very impressed by your vast knowledge of Keynes and his works. Such in-depth analysis of every facet of Keynes' arguments does not miss your eye. But....thats not the reason why I'm writing this.I've noticed the comments you've made of several different books...but please Michael..after you write each sentence, please separate the two sentences by two spaces. Like so. Reading your comments is extremely difficult when you make no spaces between sentences.Another suggestion I'd make is to separate every few sentences into its own paragraph. It makes the reading much more simple for those of us who care about what you have to say."
4,Good stuff!,"Ont ne peu pas affirmer le contraire, Hammerfall est bel et bien une formation qui nous offre servis sur un plateau près à apporter, des musiciens hors pairs. En effet, il fugure probablement parmis les meilleurs au monde. Cependant, je trouve que l'album n'est pas à la hauteur de leur talent, ils ont de bonne tounes, je ne peux dire le contraire, mais il y a des faiblesses qui sont tannante, il y a un relachement en fin de CD. Il ne faut quand meme pas etre aussi sévère, il y a de bonne choses sur cette album, les cinq premiere tounes sont vraiment très bonne, bien équilibrer avec une riff de batterie et de guitare vraiment à la hauteur de leur talent. Les deux petites balades, The Fallen One et Remember Yesterday sont de très bon got. Dans l'ensemble j'ai apprécier Legacy of the King, mais je trouve dommage qu'il n'ai pas pousser leur talent à la limite de leur capacité..."
1,typical pop-weak metal,"Average playing, ideas and singing dominate this album. This album lacks any sort of edge. The band could improve with further musical maturing."
4,"Lots of fun, somewhat ear-candyish","Not enough can be said about this record. There's not even a song as bad as ""above average,"" though the best in my opinion are ""Dreamland"" ""AT the End of the Rainbow"" and ""Warriors of Faith."" If you are at all into power metal, you probably already have this disc, but if not, you will find hours of enjoyment in ""Legacy of Kings."" The only thing that stops me from giving this record five stars is that the music is not extremely sophisticated. IT's not unsophisticated by any means, but the songwriting pales next to that of Blind Guardian or Rhapsody. The lyrics, also are somewhat contrived and repetetive (templars, steel, mighty, warriors, etc.) but when was the last time you bought a power metal CD because you heard it had good lyrics?"
4,Very good,"MY FIRST contact with HAMMERFALL was made through LEGACY OF KINGS. It's a really great metal album. One must have patience to hear the cheesy and cliched lyrics, but the music is great and the melody also. It's a band clearly a little step better than the other hundreds of European power metal bands that sings about glory, death in battle, steel, freedom, brave men, etc, etc, etc..."
2,Remembering yesterday(when i had $15.00 more in my wallet.),"I'm gonna catch some flak for this review but here we go. I'll be blunt and strait to the point, I hated this cd it was a joke and that's unfortunate cause i liked Renegade. Although between buying renegade and Legacy of Kings there was roughly a 12 month gap of time and a gap of 65 cd's(give or take a few). The entire CD was just way to slow for me, I guess after listening to bands like Primal Fear and Arch Enemy these guys just don't compare, I know they are and enitrely different type of metal, but better, i could barely get thru 1 listen of this cd it was to slow, the lyrics to cheesy and to much hymming or humming or ohhh ohhhh ohh ohhh u no what i mean, I guess my taste for music has just grown faster and harder over the year. Although I will give HF one more try with there upcomming release ""Hearts on Fire"" cd."
1,Stereotypical book by neo cons written just like Ann would.,"Fiction books like these should be avoided.Up until now I didn't think anyone made stereotypes as bad as Ann Coulter's.Certainly you can't profile a person's political views like this book does.Knowing shared opinions is one thing, but labeling everyone a stereotype is another.Biased books like these will corrupt your views of others.Unless like Ann you already label everyone who disagrees with you a ""Liberal"".Some people just can't accept any political views other than their own.Hence I rate this book a 1 star and would not recommend anyone buy it."
5,Shut Out The World,"Soft Slow Music for the busy mind. Turn off the TV, the Lights and turn on a Peace filled Experience Of Bliss and Calm. This was my first and I have 3 of their CD's Now. I must admit the music is similar on all their Cd's but having a few won't hurt. Espically if you do not have an mp3 player and want one in your car too. Makes Rush Time in Trafic less stressful and we all need that. Buy one for your grumpy Boss and tell him to listen to it on his lunch hour :>) Maybe he/she will come back smiling. ~~It sure puts babies to sleep~~ and My Dogs too!"
4,Another good solid effort from 2002,"This is a very good CD, and continues in the same basic style as their earlier Land of Forever and Crysalis CDs. However, I must admit that I personally find the music on Land of Forever more relaxing than the music contained on River of Stars."
2,River of Stars,"While each piece has a lovely melody, after you've heard it over and over again it loses its charm. If they would have done some variations on the theme it would be very enjoyable to listen to, but as it is I was ready to skip to the next track very quickly because it was so very repetitious. I agree with earlier reviews that it is reminiscent of Enya but not in the same league."
5,Wonderful Price For All You Get,I couldn't find any information on this set but I bought it anyway. I was not disappointed! My children love Caillou and this set has 3 different volumes. It includes: vol.2 Caillou: Caillou's summertime& other adventures Vol.3 Caillou: Big Brother Caillou& other adventuresVol.4 Caillou: Caillou's Train Trip & other adventures. It is a GREAT buy if you don't want to have to pay anywhere from $10-$15 a piece for them. Is a great set to own for all children!
2,Easy Piano ?,"I thought I was getting the standard notation but it is 'easy piano. The pictures shown on the 'view inside' do not indicate that this is ""easy Piano.."" this is not in any of the descriptions either. I sent it back."
4,Solid TV stand,"I must admit, I was a little skeptical when the stand arrived. The large, flat box looked like it had been through a meat grinder. I had this delivered to my office, and as I couldn't even come close to lifting it myself, I unpacked it there. Luckily, everything was intact, including the glass shelves.This thing is solid, which probably accounts for its survival of UPS shipping. The steel frame didn't even flinch when my 47"" plasma TV was mounted. The mounting system works well and allows for relatively easy height adjustment. Assembly took about an hour. There are a lot of parts but the instructions are pretty clear.A good product and a decent value, I'd recommend it. My only complaint is that it can be a little hard to get the TV to stay level at first. You really need to crank down on the knobs for that part of the mounting system. But once you get it right it's fine, overall, it's a good design and a solid product."
5,OmniMount Stellar G-3FP-HGB LCD/Plasma,Great stand; all steel and real sturdy. Built like a rock! Lets you tilt and turn the Plasma /LCD Screen easily. Great looking. Glass plates easily hold AV gear up to 150lbs.Works great in a corner application. Highly recommended. A++++++
1,Wrong Color and was responsible for cost of return,It was the wrong color. I was suppose to be ordering Sangria and I then had to pay $13 to return it. Very disappointed.
2,Interesting Pictures- Nothing Provocative Here!,"Not being willing to spend the $$$ that used-book sellers want for this book, I checked out of the local library. I was ""underwhelmed"". As someone with a background intimate to the subject at hand, I can say that Chuck has assembled an interesting historical picture book, with a cursory discussion of weapon physics theory and design theory. Nothing more. If you want to know how these weapons work, the on-line ""Nuclear Weapons Archive"" Q&A; (link, below)is much more detailed on those topics.http://gawain.membrane.com/hew/Nwfaq/Nfaq0.htmlSo, if you're looking for something here that will satisfy your desire for ""forbidden fruit"" look elswhere. This book is not worth the current asking prices."
3,lots of errors,"While Mr Hansen did a good job in most aspects of the book, he made a number of glaring mistakes that should have caught. For example, the information on the B28FI bomb and the B28RI bombs was reversed, and a lot of information on the MK 7 fuzing and firing systems was totally wrong. I know because i worked on both of these weapons for a number of years. When you see errors like that, it casts doubt on the rest of the book."
2,Over rated,"While this book has quite a cult following and demands outrageous prices as a collectors item, it is only fair as a resource. The feeling is that the book circumvents classification (it doesn't) and gives the reader the feeling that he is being told how these things work (it doesn't do that either). The physics and history is much better done in Rhodes's books at a much better price. (...) I suggest you check it out at the library before you pay these prices. I think you will see it's a nice picture book."
3,OK,"Angie's ok for those who like this sort of thing. The singing is good, but for me, there is not much of a show."
2,Stone,"Angie Stone started out a little boring and some narrative parts in between her performance, but her overall ""live"" concert was very very good."
1,cheap and uncomfortable,"These headphones are standard issue at my workplace. I didn't really have a problem with them the first couple years but any more I notice I can't wear them comfortably for more than a few minutes at a time. The design seems pretty poor, there is a hard plastic piece that digs in to your ear. In addition, I have a normal-sized head and they seem too small. The plastic piece digging in to your ear is exacerbated by the headphones not sitting evenly due to being too small.Sound quality seems okay, but I find them to be essentially unusable at this point."
3,"Okay, but needs improvement.","After 2 years, the belt clip has lost much of it's tension and easily falls off on occasion. Still willing to replace it with the same model though if the price is right, otherwise I will go for the Targus model."
5,Good Quality at a good price,I think this was a fantastic deal. Fast service. Fits perfect and I think will last longer than the cover offered by 3M. Thanks....
2,Just a Book with quiza,Althought the quizs are fun there was no board to slide in the answers like the original game.. disappointed..
5,A great game,My family and I have really enjoyed playing this game. We have taken it to many family events and even the little kids get into it. Family Feud the game is just as much or more fun that the show.
3,Family Feud review,"We're having a Family Feud family party and so I ordered the game. It came in a nice big box, but all that was inside was a booklet with the questions. I thought there would be the 2 buzzers or some kind of a board to play off of - but all that was shipped was the booklet - I was very disappointed."
3,"fun, but needs a little help","It's really only good for providing the survey questions, as the small dry erase board to fill in the answers is too tedious to use and doesn't work well for a group. It would be better to display answers on a bigger board, and have them prepared ahead in a way that they can be revealed quickly to keep the game moving and keep everyone involved/engaged. But the game is worth it simply for the big booklet of survey questions!"
5,From Giggles to Chuckles; A Look at Family Life,"The book is captivating!! My reactions ranged from mild giggles to major belly laughs. Noel takes a fresh and refreshing look at family life. His perspectives are insightful, original, and always upbeat. Time after time I experience situations in my family that elicit emotional responses: I find myself choosing between cursing and chuckling. Noel's book captures those situations in a humorous light and brings the chuckles to the forefront."
3,pretty tired tracks create little desire to dance,"A sexy dark anthem by Melonie Daniels' begins things off. Then we get a mix of Void (not my favorite, which is the junior mix, but this moody mix works here). Track 3 is an edgy instrumental, the Yello track is snooze city. Sandstorm always offers something pumpin and interesting, but track 6 is just repetitive noise. And track 7 is no better. DULL. And again on track 8. Then suddenly, we get another fierce diva track in Sense of Danger. And the disc ends of with a light, airy track with a trancey feel. Over all, this is not a particularly interesting mix. Too much uninspired instrumental stuff. Track times:1. don't you ever give up (5:26)2. void (7:05)3. heaven scent (6:34)4. squeeze please (7:31)5. the return of nothing (10:05)6. Diablo (8:29)7. Holdin On (6:16)8. Magnificat(9:38)9. Sense of Danger (5:33)10. Seven Cities (6:55)"
3,Fun for those who live in the past,An interesting buy if you watched this sort of thing as a child. I got it only because it was cheap at the time.
4,"My six year old son loves this set, but....","I gave this to my son a few months ago and he is still pulling it out to watch the dvd's. I like the stories, but, frankly, I feel like they can be a little too mature for a six year old. Apparently, the Return of the Joker is the abridged version (less violent). I can't imagine what the original version would be like because it seems like it would be perverse considering what the 'kiddie' version is like. So, my review would be this: your child will definitely like this more than a concerned adult. Entertainment value is high, but so is the violence meter."
3,Great Movies But MISLEADING,"I want you all to know that my 3-Star rating is not based on the movies themselves. I personally find all three movies to be great. Here's the reason for my mediocre score. The movies included in this set are:Batman: Mask of The PhantasmBatman & Mr. Freeze: Sub-ZeroBatman Beyond: Return of the JokerDid you catch that last one? The third movie in the Batman Movie collection is not the third true Batman movie, Mystery of the Batwoman. Amazon makes no mention of this in any product description, and the photo for the set shows the one side of the box that does not list what movies are inclided. I admit, I could have done more research to find that out before purchasing this set, although I figured 3 actual Batman movies coming in the Batman movie collection would be common sense. Apparantly not.So, long story short, 3 great, highly reccomended movies... just be aware of what movies you are buying."
4,Great Collection,I have been looking for this collection for a long time for my batman loving husband. He has really enjoyed seeing the classic batman cartoons.
5,Very good,"This soup is very good, I add some milk to it because it is a little too salty for my taste, but with that addition it is great."
2,Not real impressed,"It almost seems like I received a different soup based on the other 5 star reviews. The broth is thin, mostly cubed potatoes and very fishy smelling. Don't get me wrong, it was edible, but I won't be ordering another case of this flavor. I'm still waiting to receive the mushroom and blue cheese flavors."
2,Wonderful idea but very expensive and incomplete,I was very much looking forward to this compilation of the great toys of the 1950's and 1960's that SEARS catalogs were famous for. However this publication is extremely expensive and quite incomplete. It does hit an many of the highlights but even on many of the most popular products it skips entire years and others are missing altogether. I think this was a bit too ambitious. It may have been better to split this into 2 volumes. One for the 1950's and another for the 1960's. Also there are many toys considered to be of crossover interest (boys and girls) which are not represented. Until this book is revised or until the price drops I can't really endorse it whole-heartedly.
5,A must for catalog fans,This book is filled with memories from the first to the last page. Good quality photos. Draws one back to a much happeir time around the holidays
2,overpriced,"Was not impressed, many pages filled with murky photos, toys appeared on multiple pages and at best would appear at least half a dozen times through-out the book. It was as if the author simply got lazy and rushed to completion. If the book was half the price it would still not be worth the money paid for it."
5,Good book for starters!,"I have read this book, I really found it useful as an introductory book, the way the book is written (Questions and answers) form helped a lot, because it saves your time skimming through the questions and look up the one you want.I really found this book more useful than peter camble's one permanent magnets and their applications... This book explains the theory before getting into the applications. This book has a best two chapters about the soft and hard magnets applications.I also recommend (advances in permanent magnets) as a companion book but make sure you read this book 1st."
5,Introduction to Magnetism and Magnetic Materials,"An extremely well written book, easy to read. I have been looking for a book like this for sometime now and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject."
1,buy the product IF YOU HATE YOUR CAR,"They are a deceitful bunch. Notice they say ""high quality components."" I was led to believe that these were quality REPLACEMENTS for my dash. WRONG, stupid me, they are low quality vinyls you attach with tape. When I communicated with them via email they were altogether unhelpful and answered none of my questions. They say their pieces fit well; they do not. The title leads you to believe that the kit is made out of wood, carbon, and aluminum; I don't know where wood and aluminum came from, never saw those materials, but the carbon fiber is merely a printed image on the vinyl. If your car has done something terrible to you, buying this product for it is a great way to even the score."
4,Helps make eye-popping prints that won't fade,"This ink makes great vivid prints. Though it's a bit more expensive to use than others but prints, it'll pop your eyes out. Archival quality."
3,late,I haven't used it yet because it took three weeks for it to arrive and I had to buy another at a local store.
1,Amazon's Poor Customer Service,I ordered this product from Amazon.com. They insusted on shipping by UPS which dosen't have enough brain to get an order to me so I never reveived the order. As a result I have canceled all my outstanding orders from Amazon and will find somewhere else to purchase what I need.
3,classics,great song choices on CD 2---didn't like the selections on CD oneorder was prompt & CD's in GREAT condition!
5,Incredibubbles - Wow!,"This product was fun, although there wasn't much in the tube for the price. 100's of bubbles come out at a time, and they stick to bushes and grass. It's really fun. Kept my pet busy for a long time. I will order some again."
2,Soap taste - not appealing to dogs,"These bubbles have no flavor, other than soap.I will be giving these bubbles to my niece.They do however make a ton of great bubbles, which would appeal to young children."
5,Good fun and no mess,"My dogs (one young and very hyper, one much older) both had a blast with these bubbles. It only took a minute for them to figure out the bubbles were ""theirs,"" and they loved popping them in the air. Once the bubbles landed on the ground the dogs had fun finding them and chasing the more solid ones around the floor. It's also pretty fun to catch them in your hands. I'm surprised how durable the bubbles are! I wouldn't probably use these over carpet regularly, but I used them over a hard kitchen floor since it was rainy outside, and there was very little residue left on the floor. Not sticky and easily wiped up with a damp sponge. The few that rolled to the carpet took a few extra sponge swipes to clean up but didn't leave spots, so I'm happy even using them indoors."
3,Stick to dogs fur,This makes lots of bubbles that do stay even when they hit the ground but they stick to my dogs fur and are difficult to brush out.
3,Doggy Incredibubbles,They are messy in the house but they do last long enough for our littledog to find them.
1,Waste of Money,"I gave it a one star so I don't feel like chump for buying this product. You can only blow these bubbles on a day that there is no breeze. They fly away faster than your dog has a chance to catch them. I had to lie on my stomach to blow the bubbles, so my dog would have a chance to get them. When my dog did catch the bubbles it made a sticky mess all over his beautiful fur as the bubbles are plastic not soap. The only way I can see these bubbles being worth your money is if you are at a gathering with both animals and people of varying heights who can run in all directions to get the bubbles. Otherwise, they become very expensive for the one or two bubbles your pet can catch."
3,mixed thoughts about this,"The bubbles come in a small container with a very flimsy wand and tiny wand that is hard to blow bubbles thru. The bubbles are very small, but when you do use this product, there are many bubbles and they are truly unique. They don't pop easily, stay aloft longer than any I've seen, and you can even hold them. They seem almost plastic to texture. My dogs didn't show much interest in them. But it could have been the distraction of the other toys I ordered. So I liked some of the uniqueness of this product."
2,Disappointed these weren't the same quality,Disappointed as the product doesn't appear to have the same quality when compared to the same product I purchased in a Pet Store. Unfortunately these are no longer available in Canadian pet stores so I went to find them elsewhere as my dog loves them. The bubble mixture appears thinner and the bubbles are not resilient when they land on the ground and break almost instantly which is disappointing as my dog loves the hunt. I bought a large number to offset the cost of the shipping ~ wish I had only purchased one as these are definitely not the same quality as what I have seen before with this product. Very disappointed.
3,Dog is scared of them,"Thought my puppy would like these to play with, but she is scared to death of them. Even the cats don't seem that interested in them. Glad I didn't buy the bubble blower system for about $25. Maybe she'll eventually get used to them."
3,Works but not for every dog,"I have four dogs and I thought one of them was bound to like this activity. I especially had high hopes for my dog Bandit (chorkie mix) and Zara (Siberian husky) since they have high energy levels. Unfortunately, not one of them knew what to make of these bubbles. Simply, they just were not interested. I wonder if maybe a different scent would get them more appeal, rather than peach perhaps bacon, chicken, any meat flavor. Otherwise, the product does work well....the bubbles do not pop on a surface and they are long lasting. Just make sure to do this activity outside because there is a white gooey film left after they are popped."
3,Fun at first..hassle to clean up,My fur babies seem to love the bubbles and it was fun watching them trying to chomp down on the bubbles mid air. The bubbles last long but once they pop they leave white residue everywhere!!! The residue also sticks to the dogs' fur and it was a hassle to get them off the fur.
5,loved it,"perfect! my dog cant get enough of them, they smell like a nice peach and dont pop in the air like your average bubble! this product is exactly as i was led to believe 5 stars!"
2,Dog gone it!,"My dog loves chasing bubbles, but not this variety. He did the first few times but then decided he didn't like the flavor or something about it. I didn't like it because it was gummy and left a residue behind. I wouldn't buy this again."
3,Not what I expected,The ColorVision PrintFIX PRO Suite maybe a good product for the price but it is not what I expected. There are products that are 10 times the price that may or not be better. My findings after calibration are: The CRT monitor calibration makes the grayscale and the colors with too much red. The printer calibration makes the grayscale and the colors with too much red. If you hold natural gray objects next to the monitor or printed grayscale pictures you will see the redness. The printed pictures do seem to match the monitor. Bottom line: The accuracy of a monitor or a printer depends on the information that comes from the color profiles. I find this product makes color profiles inaccurate.
5,PrintFIX Pro,"Great product - does what it says on the box with ease. The only advice I would give, is that when scanning the color swatches to set up the printer profile, be sure to put a few sheets of white paper under the swatch page, this stops the spectrometer from seeing any dark surface under the swatches and upsetting the results. The printer and monitor software walks you through the setup in an easy to understand way."
1,Forget it,"This book is hopeless without the instructional CD of the same name that is advertised on the White Cliffs web site. However it seems the instruction CD doesn't exist. Give the book a miss, there are plenty of better books on African drumming."
5,Impeccable,"The poor review of the DVD version was obviously because he expected a DVD Video disk when this is a DVD Audio disk. When you are listening to music on DVD Audio it must be good as you can hear every last detail. An average album in CD can sound fine but all the faults show up in DVD-A. I've heard Romances in DVD-A over and over and it sounds better every time because it is faultless. As his first self produced album Luis wanted it to be true to himself, not false but true and therefore very listenable. And those strings .... lush and gorgeous."
5,This is the best toy ever,My cats all love Da'Bird. I would recommend this to any cat owner who is willing to play with their cats. I have ordered all the attachable pieces except the butterfly and dragonfly and my cats love them all.
2,Two Pack = one,"Ordered this thinking I was ordering a 2 pack. But, I only received one. Chatted with customer service and she tried to convince me that this 2 pack meant only 1 refill. Huh?So, seeing as I could not convince her that I was right and that 2 means two I am sending it back. I can go to the pet store and get one for $5.00 Since when does a 2 pack mean one? Someone here is living in another dimension."
5,My cats' favourite toy,"My critters love this toy so much I have to get refills. They are pretty well made, but the cats spend a lot of time trying to get them and they fight hard to keep them when they're successful.Best. Cat. Toy. Ever."
4,Da Bird Cat Toy!,"What a wonderful toy! Our cat loves it, and even wakes us up in the middle of the night to play! However one issue we experienced was that the feather attachment breaks very quickly. We've had 4 of these break almost immediately upon attaching it to stick and playing with it for a few minutes. I think it's the quality of the metal swivels where it attaches to the snap hook on the end of the string. Overall our cat can't get enough of this thing, though I wish it lasted longer!"
5,latest in an excellent series,Every book in this series is very good and Steve Hamilton shows no signs of running out of inspiration.
2,Very Slow!,"I got this book based on the high reviews it got on Amazon. I don't know how it can be termed ""thriller"" as virtually nothing happens until the last 50 pages of the book and then the action is minimal.Alex, a ""retired"" investigator tries to solve a mystery as to why an old man left his girlfriend and old hat with snow and a message before walking out into the snow and dying. Most of the book takes place with Alex going back and forth from his house to the Michigan town that the incident took place and to Canada where his girlfriend is from. Sometimes it is difficult to remember where Alex is without going back a few pages to re-read where he is.When the mystery was solved, I felt myself cheated to have read 300 pages for virtually nothing."
3,Not as good as the rest in the series,"This is Steve Hamilton's 6th book about Alex McKnight, a retired police officer living in northern Michigan. I've loved this series, but I have to say that Ice Run is easily the weakest to date.The story has Alex and his girlfriend Natalie meeting up for a weekend in a luxury hotel. There they have a brief encounter with an eccentric old man who claims to recognize one of the them and then wanders off into the snow and dies. Alex is determined to find out what the man was talking about and quickly finds that the man's relatives are equally determined to prevent him.The book takes a very long time to get going. It hinges on a mystery that isn't that interesting and is unnecessarily complicated. Moreover, the eventual resolution is just silly. The other books in this series have been so good, but this one is not in the same league."
2,Leica Camera Repair Handbook Review,"Superficial, not enough to really get you started on actually repairing Leica Cameras. Covers way too many models from all the screw mounts, M and even R models with 1-2 pages at the most for each one. The book essentially gives you an idea of what it takes to repair cameras but is not a step by step illustrated guide for actually repairing them. This is what I expected and was disappointed."
1,Not for Me,After purchasing an SL that needed a cleaning I bot this book hoping to open it up and clean the viewfinder. I even had hopes of cleaning the dust from the 50mm summicron lens. My anticipation grew as I awaited this magical tome that would help me restore this old classic almost to its original condition. Then I received this book. I might as well have bought a manual on do-it-yourself brain surgery. Camera repair is not for the laymen and this book is not written for the laymen. It is written for the seasoned camera repairmen that may need to get the lay-of-the-land for the occaisonal Leica repair he has to perform. This book assumes the reader is well versed in camera repair. I put it on ebay 6 minutes after receiving it - nuff said.
4,"Leica Camera Repair Handbook, a good book but miss some ....","Leica Camera Repair Handbook is a good book, it is not for begginer or professional, I think it is target for hobbist, but in this book it miss some important things, like how to replace the shutter curtain - a very common problem in old screw mount Leica, it did mention about the rangefinder problem a good plus. I have bought many repair books that wroten by him."
3,Eye Opening Presentation,For me there is not enough text or pictures to let me feel confident enough to take my M3 apart. With that said the book does demonstrate the complexity of Leica cameras..
3,"Not as good as the others, but ""Rayando el sol"" make it rock","I bought this cd for one reason, ""Rayando el sol"" cause that song is one of their best songs! But the rest of the cd is average ""Perdido en un barco"" is a nice latin pop song and ""Falta Amor"" is a nice lyric song, but it doesn`t have the same feeling as ""Suenos Liquidos"" ""Unplugged"" and ""Cuando los angeles lloran"" but it is worth to have for any real mana fan(like me). It is also alot softer then their new material!"
3,"A complete review, with nothing extra.","This early Mana sound is not too bad, but most of the songs sound the same. Ofcourse if it wasent for this CD we would have never heard ""Rayando el sol""(scratching the sun) wich is one of the best songs in the world. Another fantastic song in this CD is ""Perdido en un barco""(lost in a ship) wich has a caribean sound. Song number nine ""La puerta azul""(the blue door) will make your heart remember love. Although this CD was made by four Mexicans It has no Mariachis on it, but most songs include an acustic guitar. Its not the best CD in the world but after all this record was made by Mana and when was the last time you heard a bad Mana song?"
3,"Interesting read, but meandering","Mr Amberger puts together a very good read, and presents very interesting points. However, I feel that he partially fails in his promise to show ""development of sword fighting techniques throughout Europe's history"". He points out some interesting evidence from Ancient, Dark ages, and Medieval periods. Unfortunately he mis-uses historical terms, fails to explore topics fully, and presents some bad facts.I also feel that the book does not benefit from the mensur bias, which even colours his analysis of the Silver Vs Saviolo debate.It is a good addition to the library of anybody interested in the history of martial combat in Europe. But do read critically and carefully."
5,One of the best works on the sword since Richard Burton!,"Terse, witty, and chock-full with new, provocative (and often controversial) insights. Even if you don't happen to agree with the author on all points, you can't help but stand in awe of the sheer volume of material and sources that went into researching this book. Yet despite sources that range from the Odyssey over the medieval masters to the most recent archeological, historical, and sports science titles, Amberger actually produces a great read.If you only buy one fencing or sword related book this summer... this should be it!"
2,"Dull, Clinical, Passionless","I got this book with high hopes from the title. Now I can say save your money. This thing was so dry and dull I kept looking back at the cover to make sure it was the same book. Secret history ""of the Sword""? There was hardly any mention of ""swords"" in the book, it was a miss-mash ad hoc collection of disjointed essays and misplaced humor with no connecting theme. It's really only about a fencing take on everything, not at all about arms and armor and not even European martial arts. It reads like a college textbook throughout and the author's over intellectualizing belittles the reader as if they are beneath his ""wisdom"". Amberger brooks no dissent with his polemics. As fencing history it's sometimes of middling interest, but unless you're one of those people who think that sword fighting began with the rapier and foil you will find this dull, dull, and dull."
1,acehardwareoutlet sucks!,"I had been looking all over for this item to replace existing fencing. Thought I had finally found it and ordered one 3' package from Ace Hardware so I could test it. Placed my order, got a confirmation, thought I had checked an item off my to-do list .............. until I got an email from them wanting me to fax them an authorization form, a copy of a photo ID, a copy of my credit card, and other information I had already filled out online because of ""security concerns."" Don't know what THEIR security concerns are, but I am not sending photocopies of my ID, credit card, and a signed form for a one item order of less than $50!"
5,Bayberry Candle Tradition,Definitely would purchase it again. The burning time was perfect for our Christmas Eve family tradition with a natural bayberry scent.
5,"Great Spider Robinson, with a magic word","This book is from 1985.It contains the title selection and 11 others, including 'Rubber Soul' and ""Concordiat to 'Rubber Soul'"", which is of interest to Beatles fans.There is also a story about a time-traveling gangster called 'Chronic Offender'. In this story, on page 124, he uses the word 'muggles', which is pretty funny.This is a good book to complete a Spider Robinson collection."
1,Dont waste your money!,"This book is a collection of ""work outs"" from other books in the series. There is little new information that you can not get from previous books. Of interest is a section in the book called ""Stew Smith's Ruck Marching Tips""...This same information has been found for years in the US Army Special Forces ""pre-selection"" physical training guide word for word! Plagarism? Get a free Special Forces (pre selection) physical training guide from your recruiter and save money for something more useful"
5,A Must have for the Serious Minded...,"I am a prior service operator for the US Army. This is a must have book for the Serious minded individual who has the drive to enter this field. The book offers workouts for the various aspects of Special Operations. Not all are the same, and the workouts follow the critical areas. Thats Not Good Enough for YOU? Then design your own, utilizing your areas of interest. The Book can also be used for Public Health and Safety personal, for optimal performance in the civilan sector."
3,Good,The book is not what I expected but it is a good book none the less. I was expecting more running and aerobic style programs but this is designed more for strength type exercises.
2,Eh.,"This book is worth buying only for Stew Smith's workouts. I personally liked the Army stuff the most of anyting he's done(which isn't available in the other books). It's basic, simple bodyweight exercise for the most part. Running, rucking, swimming, rope climbing, and lots of cals.My complaint was with Mejia's ""SOCOM"" workouts. They're the kind of trendy stuff that Smith wisely eschews in all of his other books. The pictures are...unmotivational. (If I wanted to look like that guy, I'd buy a cookbook instead of a workout book)"
5,I have this book and i am the best drawer in my 4th grade,"I love this book and I almost bring it every where I go, even school.AND ALL MY FRIENDS WANT TO LOOK AT IT.THANKS CHRIS, NOW I THINK I'M GOING TO BE A COMIC BOOK ARTIST."
5,couldn't ask for more.,"just the part i needed and recieved it 3 days early!brand new w/ bleeder kit, great buy-couldn't ask formore,thank you."
3,too much tinkering.,"The reworked translation doesn't hold the spirit of the original FFT. The cutscenes are fine, and save this game from a 2 star rating, or something like that--but they really should've left the original translation alone."
2,This remake makes me sad.,"Imagine if everything you wanted to do took 4 times longer than it should take. That's what playing this game is like. All of the special animations slow down to a crawl, and you're left wondering why you paid $40 for a game that came out 8 years ago, but has LESS SPEED. The new dialogue is repulsive, the slow-down is unreal and unbearable, and the new classes are positively worthless in single-player mode (the dark knight requires mastering 2 jobs and getting job level 8 in 4 others! you'd finish the game before you got half of that done).This is by far the worst remake of a Final Fantasy game I've ever played in my life, and that's saying a lot, because Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my all-time favorite games. So good, in fact, that I can't even bear to give this remake 1 star. If you want to play this game, find the original. Avoid this remake at all costs."
2,A lot of disappointment with a little excitement,"I'm going to make this short and sweet because the other low reviews pretty much cover everything. This was a weak remake of a great game. Now I know everyone who loves the original FFT wants to give this 5 stars, but this was [..].Sounds and animations that separate, a rather over-complex dialogue (I liked the one in the original. Yes, I know it was rushed and came out bad, but that added some of the charm). Everything slows down for no reason, you would've thought they would have worked stuff like this out before releasing this game.But wait, 2 NEW JOB CLASSES ZOMG! One is useless unless you master all the other classes (and find it's equipment in VS mode) and the other is really too difficult to worry about getting in the greater scheme of things.Nice try, I hope they get it right the next time around."
4,Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of The Lions,"I enjoy this game very much. It's a great turn based strategy game, with an enjoyable storyline."
2,Too difficult!!,"I bought this game for my husband, who happens to be 40yrs old. He loved the old Final Fantasy, however, he does not even play this one!!! He said it is not fun because it is too hard to play."
2,Nothing new to see here,"Everyone I know who is a fan of tactics is a true fanatic. We loved this game and want sequels in the series. This, is not a new game. It should be a ""gold edition"" or ""10 year anniversary series"" There are 2 new features between this and the original:Some animationsMultiplayer capabilityThis doesn't constitute a new game and a new title. Also as other reviewers have pointed out, the game runs slowly. I think Square Enix should take this off the shelf and create the sequel that fans really want."
3,A lot of excitement with a little disappointment,"When first hearing and reading about Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions I was ecstatic. I purchased it as soon as I could for my PSP and was slightly disappointed when I realized it was exactly the same as my Playstation game, Final Fantasy Tactics. The only difference this game has is the change in names of some characters, the dialogue is all new and worded differently as if it were out of Medieval England or some such depiction of the Medieval era, and the new cut scenes are great with an incredible animation style but alas the lines are a little cheesy.If you love Final Fantasy Tactics this is a great way to make it portable. Just note, there are differences in names, what classes are called, and how they speak. Took a little getting used to but the game is still a lot of fun."
5,Fun!,"I've never played the PS1 version, but currently I'm playing this game more than any of my other PSP titles."
4,A New View for an Old Game,"When I first purchased this game I thought it would be a whole new adventure set in Ivalice after we all saw Ramza kick the bucket. However this game is exactly like the origional Final Fantasy Tactics with some changes. The changes are as follows: Some characters have different names, some locations have different names, and everyone speaks as if they are part of some poorly written old english stage performance. The dialogue is not all that bad, just how it went from english to whatever it is now was kind of funky to get used to. The cinematics are great, I love how they are drawn but the dialogue is lacking. All the lines are cheesy at best but the visuals are good. All in all, if you loved FFT, then you will love this game, just be prepared for some changes."
2,"Boring, full of complaints","Boring book, angry man..have to wonder if there is not some racial prejudice there that he tries to hide...goes to show just becasue someone is good at a sport does not make them a saint"
1,Balls,"This book was supposed to be like new,but was very old and worn with some pages falling out. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
4,plastic focuser,I have had many Meade telescopes. This is a nice telescope with decent optics but the weak part is the plastic rack and pinion focuser..I replaced the focuser with a new metal focuser and not it is a first rate refractor..Nice starter or intermediate scope..
3,Rontgen's discovery was not accidental,"Sorry Mary R. Hofmann, Rivera Middle School, Merced, CA, in your review you describe Rontgen's discovery of x-rays as accidental. This is not true. Rontgen was in the process of working through a carefully designed series of experiments with the newly developed vacuum tubes that he knew would lead to discoveries. Because he did not know what he would discover, he named the new rays ""x"" for the mathematical unknown. As a professional radiographer, I take offense at describing his work, which led to the first Nobel ever given in Physics, as accidental. This is a common misperception and I have tried to carefully explain this in my books as well as my classes for more than 30 years now. Please don't take offense, but please don't continue the error."
5,great,this set was pretty good with English audio Dragonball Z is pretty good it is better than any other anime.so I think that this Set could have been better if they had the original Japanese audio it was in its original format not 16 by 9 it was 4 by 3 which is good. I like when gohan goes great ape and nearly kills Piccolo.
4,The start of Gohan's training! Goku's journey in Snake Way,"This volumen starts where vol.2 left off at the start of Gohan's traning with Piccolo. His first excercise to survive alone in the wilderness for six months. Imagine a four-year-old kid with unlimited potential alone in the desert. Goku after been killed by Raditz begins his journey through Snake Way in order to train with King Kai or Kaioh.This is a excellent filler volumen except maybe the last episode which is pretty slow and got no impact on later episodes at all,not to mention having the crappiest dub ever!!!This line of dvds from funimation are worth all it's hype with the excellent audio tracks of japanese,spanish and english 2.0 and 5.1 tracks. I'm off until my next review !@!"
3,Good show/Bad extra's,Great show and episodes are good. Was nice to watch them in original format. I didn't like that the extra's was the same Goku vs. Vagetta feture that was in the 1st. dvd. Also was lacking the follow nibus extra which I thought was real cool. All in all you need it to continue the series but would love more special features.
1,a lot smaller than it looks,There is a reason they don't give you dimensions for this pellet trap -- it's very small. It's pretty worthless.
5,Amazing! A wonderful gizmo!,"This does exactly what it's supposed to do, and its competent design and packaging (and reasonably idiot-proof directions) make it an absolute joy. So much better than the old ""just jab in the garden hose, and keep your fingers crossed"" approach."
3,"Not great, but did the job","This product is very cheaply made and probably won't stand up to repeated use. If you are just going to fill or drain a waterbed, this will work, but don't expect to use it more than once or twice. Be very careful when screwing a hose onto it because the cheap, soft plastic will strip out extremely easily!I used it to drain the waterbed mattress that my wife and I had used for at least 10 years, but which had finally sprung so many leaks that we decided it was time to replace it. Since it is getting hard to find waterbeds or waterbed mattresses these days, we opted for a memory foam mattress this time."
2,Didnt fit my faucets,"Both of my faucets are from Home Depot. Nothing fancy. The adapter didn't fit either.I did manage a work around for draining by connecting to my outdoor faucet. BTW, the instructions didnt tell you turn off the faucet once you have your siphon. Dont forget or you will waste allot of water.I haven't filled the bed yet but pretty sure its going to be damn cold with water from the outdoor.. Considering filling from the water heater but that might be too hot.In short, it was useless for me when using with my two indoor sink faucets..It wasn't a complete failure, thus two stars."
3,Falls apart eventually in windy areas,After a year the fence starts to break apart. It is not constructed that well and if you have a few windy days each bamboo strip will start to work loose. I have had to tie up the fence numerous times to keep it attached together. I recommend this fence in sheltered areas not subject to a lot of wind. I also would buy two and put them over each other if you really want privacy because there is space between each strip of bamboo.
2,"Good start, lousy finish","After a year or two the galvanized wires have rusted sufficiently, and been weakened, that winds rip the fence apart by breaking the wires. Galvanized steel is absolutely not sufficient for outside use. Stainless steel wire is required for outside use, unless you want to replace these every 2-3 years."
1,Item arrived full of green and black mold with bad odor.,Item arrived with black and green mold. This is obviously a very low quality product. Stay away.
2,Not like the one in store,The one i received was very rubbery tasting. Compared to the one i bought in the store this one is horrible. Maybe i got a bad bag (it happens). But wouldn't purchase this again unless i know its a newer batch. Also if your in a hot climate be aware that this is chocolate and it does melt.
5,"I Second ""Best Granola Ever""....No Hyperbole!","Seriously, not kidding, the best combination of tastes and textures I have ever experienced. I see many bags of this granola in my future...."
3,Beware of incorect tabbing by AMSCO,"Beware when purchasing any AMSCO books that tab AC/DC.... some are correct, but alot, infact TOO MANY are tabbed incorectly. half are bad and sloppy...dont pay any more then $10 for this. There is too much that is incorect. AMSCO dont even take the time to realise they have incorect tabs, because there still putting the same WRONG tabs into there latest books! Avoid AMSCO, or dont pay alot. ""Hard As a Rock"" is not tabbed correctly, and that might be the song your after?"
3,"""Global Groove's THRILL, a thumping dance sensation!""","Such a sexy cover: big menz with bigger muscles, flexed, buffand waiting. But lets chat about the music! Imagine you are at aPRIDE parade. Pick any city, NY, London, Toronto, Paris. Now imagine the thumping soundtrack, this in a nutshell is THRILL. A Thumping dance sensation. MAGDALENA, track 1, pure big room dance music with the distorted vocals and that disco era hook. Keepin' the energy up, up, up, DJ Roland Belmares werks for his! Next up, that Aretha Franklin sound-a-like Chance, pumps it up on RESCUE ME, Bini & Martini's 999 Funk Mix. Buildups, breakdowns, hand claps, chants and piano stans punctuate the sounds of Dawn Tallman's WAKE UP. But if you were falling asleep, track 9, Abigails's IF IT DON'T FIT is sure to wake you up! The lyrics: ""My momma said if it don't fit Don't force it!"" (Repeat 3 times!) Global Grooves THRILL, a thumping dance sensation!"
1,Alert iPod owners !!,"Centaur Records (Global Groove and several other records they produce) has recently configured their CDs so that you can't download them to your iPod. If you are like most people who load their music to their iPod, CDs produced by Centaur Records are worthless.I would recommend you make sure CDs aren't produced by them before buying. You can also go to centaurrecords.com to see their list of CDs."
4,Wonderful Miller Classics,"You don't have to be a product of the Big Band era to enjoy the beautiful sounds of this incredible album, The Essential Glenn Miller. This music is timeless and should appeal to anyone who enjoys music played by real musicians and the sounds of real band singers."
3,Not Essentially Glenn Miller,"While even the worst Glenn Miller is better than most music, there certainly could have been some better recordings. The second of the two CD's is much better than the first. I want Glenn Miller but I would buy some of his other compilations first."
5,Buying Epson Inks at Amazon,Getting quality inkjet prints is not a cheap proposition. Amazon.com makes life a lot easier by letting us link up with providers who sell these things at a reasonable price with quick delivery. Kudos to Amazon and Adorama.
5,Esto es un clasico para todo rockero,"Esto es un clasico para todo rockero fan del TRI, tiene un concierto sin censuras, la grabacion del disco se oye bien para ser en vivo. Debes de tenerla en tu coleccion."
2,I tried to like it....,"My hopes were high for this book but for whatever reason, it simply did not deliver. It was not particularly well written and the character development was not believable. It missed as a serious literary effort and if the goal was to express some other perspective, it got past me. The authors need to keep their day jobs."
1,"Lid does not seal, infact has a huge hole on the side!","Aren't crockpots supposed to have a nice seal so the foods cook in their own juices?The lid does not even fit well and in fact they have a huge hole in the lid to put in the mixing spoon/ladle. Even after putting the ladle, there is plenty of gap for steam to escape. Also, who would want a plastic ladle dipped into the food while its being cooked!?I'm returning my crock pot for sure."
1,Fast cooker,I have this purchase packaged up and ready for return. Nothing slow about it and dangerously hot on the counter.
1,Ouch - Blistered burnt thumb from the cover handle melting off!,"I'm actually on my 2nd of this model. After a few uses, the first one would just shut off after a couple hours. That makes for a very unpleasant surprise when arriving home from work expecting dinner. Costco was good to take that one back and I got another of the same model. This one has been fine, but recently, I've noticed that it is getting progressively hotter. To the point that I'm not confident leaving it unattended. I agree with other posters that it is much too hot on any setting and I have been slow cooking for 30 years. This evening I was lifting the lid off the pot to serve dinner and the handle came right off the cover and I burned my hand in the process of trying to juggle the cover. The plastic on the handle is actually melted! Could that be a result of the pot getting to hot?? This one is going back to Costco too, but I'll be shopping around for a better replacement."
2,Do not leave this crockpot unattended... until you test every recipe,"I used this crock pot for the first time today. My 4 lb pork roast that was supposed to cook and mellow over eight hours on low was done in about five. I tested the temperature after 6 hours based on other reviews, and its temp was well over 200 degrees and falling apart The roast tastes fine, but I'll have to test every recipe before leaving this unit alone. It's low setting is more like a medium high!"
1,Gald we aren't the only ones,"We received this as a gift last Christmas and thought it was us that kept over cooking or cooking things to fast. Misery loves company, it's good to know we aren't the only ones unhappy with the high heat. Last week on Thanksgiving we put the mashed potatoes in the pot and even on the lowest setting they were boiling."
5,Works well for me,"I was surprised by the above reviews about this crockpot cooking on too high a temperature. I have not had this problem at all. I made a beef stew, chicken stew, and pulled pork with this slow cooker so far. I always use the 10-hour low setting because I work all day. These meals have come out just fine every time. Maybe I have a newer version (I just got this as a gift in October 2007)? Anyway, this slow cooker has worked very well for me and I have had no problems at all."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I wish I had read some of the reviews on this site before I purchased this crockpot last year. I thought it was my imagination that everything was ""boiling"" too soon. I decided to send a complaint to the company and was told to test it by filling it over half full and checking the temp. I used cold tap water because I didn't want to ruin another meal. I put only 3-1/2 quarts in this 6-quart cooker because any more would have brought it to the edge. After 4 1/2 hours on low the water was boiling. I emailed the results and was told this was normal. As far as I'm concerned, this is not ""slow-cooking""! I will never buy another Crock-Pot."
1,Burns everything,"I've had this slow cooker for about a year and a half now. This cooker burns EVERYTHING unless I stay home to babysit it. I find that 10 hour recipes burn at the top and round the edges after only a few hours on the low setting.I was so disheartened to come home from work and smell burnt lamb vindaloo/chili/lentil soup. I finally gave up on it. Since the warranty is expired, I decided to keep it and use it for keeping things warm for parties, etc. It is completely worthless as a slow cooker.If you plan on using this to cook while you are away, do a little research on other brands. I do not recommend this one."
1,Piece Of JUNK!!!!!,"This crockpot has to be the cheapest made available. First the front top handle broke off, then the hinged lid broke, leaving the screw in my soup I was cooking. I had to cover all the holes in the lid with foil to use. Yesterday the top handle broke off!!!! I will never buy another rival product!!!!"
1,cook too fast,I got this one as a wedding gift a few years back. I started using it only last year and thought that I was doing something wrong when everything turned out burned. I am so gratified to read these reviews because they exactly mirrored my own experience. Everything is burned even at the lowest setting - it starts burning even before the half way point is reached in the cooking time. I think I will look for another one.
1,Doesnt even Boil!,I read a few reviews and found mine was very different. I have had mine for about a year and I do a lot of canning and make many roasts. I didnt notice any problems with the roasts. But I have attempted to make sevral batches of apple sauce and apple butter and the crockpot does NOT even come to a boil. after 20 hours my apple butter had not even cooked down 1 inch because it never came to a boil.I ended up transfering the apple butter into a standard pot on the stove to finish it. I had to buy a new crockpot to finish up the canning season. I do NOT reccomend this crockpot.
1,Poor construction,"I purchased this crock pot a year ago from Costco and have already returned it as the lid came apart. It overcooked everything to the point that it melted the lid handle & it broke. Happy that Costo, the wonderful store that it is, returned my money. Don't waste yours with this purchase."
3,Nancee Swatyz,"Nancee Swartz. For a slow cooking device, I have found it to be well-made and durable. We have used it for several occasions. It holds 6 quarts which is a medium sized entree and large enough for most produce. It is also made of stainless steel and is easy to clean in the dishwasher. Nancee Swartz"
2,No replacement lid??,"Have used this crockpot 4-6 times a month. Occasionally it will burn foodbut not often enough to give up the convenience of use. However, the handle on the lid has crumbled away and I haven't been able to find a replacement part anywhere. With no replacement parts, I will have to discard it; but, this time I will do my homework and see what brands really do carry replacement parts before I buy."
1,Crock Pot Brand,Agree with all the reviews that it cooks too fast. I'd also like to add that they no longer sell replacement parts. . .well they do only you have to live in Canada to receive them. Disappointed in the brand.
2,NOT a SLOW cooker.,"Even on the lowest setting it boiled, it cooks at way too high a temperature. Food was overcooked, it is a waste of money. I'll stick with my old one. You would think appliances could be IMPROVED upon over time. It looks good, but doesn't do the job for which it is intended."
1,Too Hot,"Just like other posters, this Crockpot on the 10 hour setting cooks most recipies in under 6. Many in 4.This is useless for the throw it in the pot and hope it to be ready later.Heck the other day, my wife made sure I checked on the meal at the 6th hour. I did, and turned it from the 10 hour setting to the keep warm. The food was good at the 6th hour, it was crispy fried 3 hours later after sitting on WARM. This is a typical crockpot recipe that called for being on high for 8 hours. and this thing on low cooked it in 6 and fried it on warm.Interestingly, we had a similar earlier model that was white. It didn't have this problem. Then about a year ago it started cooking really hot all the time. This one came as a Christmas gift, yet it is also way to hot.I would venture to say that given the variability of the reviews that there is a thermal regulator in these things that either goes bad, or just doesn't work on many of them."
1,It spits!,"I have owned many Rival Crockpots over the years and was very happy with them. When I wanted to upgrade to 6 quarts, I chose this one. Big mistake. The lid is not a good fit and, consequently, hot condensation spits on to the countertop and floor leaving puddles everywhere. I hate this pot! I have since bought a Hamilton Beach slow cooker and it works perfectly. Avoid this product at all costs."
1,Cooks TOO FAST. Way TOO HOT on the lowest setting.,Two Rival crock pots. Two failed attempts at crock pot cooking. Rival crock pots cook way too fast on the lowest setting. I do NOT recommend them. I'm kicking mine to the curb today... I'll be buying a higher rated product at a lower price...
2,Ditto....heats way too fast for a slow cooker,"Have had this for about a year.....and use it 2-3 times a month......I don't know why it took so long, but just the other day I realized that this slow-cooker was heating up way too fast and maintaining too high of a temperature.........on the 10 hour setting, my chili was boiling after only 4 and a half hours.......I found myself stirring it (this being a no-no for a slow-cooker) thinking it was going to stick and burn........I could never trust this to be left on during my absence.........I am looking to replace this now.....initial research shows the Hamilton-Beach or All Clad as possible replacements......To leave on a positive note.....the quality seems to be fairly good....i.e. no problem with the controls......no ceramic chipping or cracking........lid doesn't seal that well, but is constructed fairly decent....."
1,Cheap construction,"I purchased this a year ago from costco. It was fine for 11 months, but it is now in the dumpster. A month ago, the plastic handle broke off, then the next time I used it the handle broke off the lid. I went ahead and cooked anyway not noticing the crack in the stoneware insert. This was a piece of junk."
1,cooks WAY too hot!,"I originally received a crock pot brand slow cooker for a wedding present. Overall I was happy with it but it was too small for our growing family. So I decided to invest in this slow cooker thinking it would work as well as my previous crock pot. WRONG! This slow cooker burns my food EVERY TIME! I place my food on low and only 4 hours later it's burnt at the bottom and the liquid is rapidly boiling. The only way to keep it from burning is to keep stirring it but who stands over a slow cooker while it's cooking? It's a waste of money, food and time."
1,Another unhappy customer - way too hot!,"Like many other reviewers, mine cooks waaay too hot. Boils even on low.I tried several recipes and all were overcooked and stringy (they were all meat) hours before the minimum recommended cooking time. A friend made her tried-and-true beef recipe while visiting - same thing happened to her.I've had it for too long to return it. What a waste of money. This is the second Rival crockpot I've had - the first one did the same thing, but I thought it overcooked because it was a cheap model (<$20)."
1,HUNK OF JUNK!!!,The Glass crock was not right and the lid would not set squarely on it. I then contacted the manufacturer about this and was sent a replacment crock.It was even worse! I contacted them again by email. I was then given an order number for another crock if I wanted to buy one.So basically the thing is a bad deal!! I will never own another Crockpot brand again!!
1,"Dangerous, unsafe to use","The Rival SCVP600-SS is DANGEROUS to use due to poor construction quality. The plastic handle to the lid came off completely from the lid when I was lifting the lid off the pot. Fortunately, it only dropped a few inches, and did not fall into the extremely hot broth and splatter the boiling hot contents on me. Also, one handle on the side cracked off from the metal support. In both cases, the plastic handles literally melted away from the metal fittings (washer on the lid and and wired struts on the side). Please be careful if you use this product."
1,"Too fast, too hot!",I received this slow cooker for Christmas last year and have never been happy with it. The first time I used it my dish boiled and burned so I thought it was broken. My husband called Rival and they said they hadn't heard of this problem. We sent it back and they sent us a new one. I have used the new one a few times and same problem. I checked out this sight and reviews out of curiosity and it certainly confirmed my experience. My mother's very old avocado green crock pot works so much better than this new one. The only nice feature of the new one is the removable crock but ease of cleaning doesn't justify a lousy overcooked meal.
2,Way too hot! Must cook everything at 10-hour setting,"This crock pot will get the job done, but you have to cook everything on the 10-hour setting because it cooks at way too high a temperature. If a recipe calls for 8-10 hours on low, you'll need to cook at the 10-hour setting for about 5-6 hours. That's how hot it cooks. Don't even try using the hotter settings or your food will burn."
1,Lid fell apart,"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She has used it once or twice a week since. Last week, the plastic on the lid handle and hinge broke off. Rival must have used very poor quality plastic on this unit."
1,Worst Crockpot Ever,I'm with most everyone else on this - it cooks waaaaayyyy to fast and even on the slowest setting it burns the food. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.
3,No problems,"I haven't had any problems with burning. The reason I don't LOVE this crock pot is that the programming options are just too limited. You get High for 4 or 6 hours, and low for 8 or 10. What if I want to cook on low for six hours? Or even high for 5? You can't cycle through the settings to turn it to warm, the only way it will go is at the end of the cycle. Still have to pay attention to what time you turned it on, just in case. Also, it doesn't seem like the lid creates a very good seal, and isn't that a must with crock pots? It gets the job done and is probably worth the low price, but I am going to upgrade to the true programmable one."
1,Way too hot!,"I recently got this cooker at Costco, and have made 3 dinners with it.The liquid began to BOIL within 2 hours on every occasion, and that was on the lowest setting possible. The unit was very hot, would burn your hand if you inadvertantly touched it - not good if kids are around! Also, the counter underneath the cooker was so hot that I was afraid that it would be damaged and had to place the unit on a wooden cutting board.I will be returning it pronto. Skip this cooker and try another brand."
1,Rival Smart Pot,"I have to agree with all the other reviews about the Rival ""Smart"" pot. It boils on 10 hr. setting!!! What a terrible product!! I'm donating mine and buying another crock pot but it won't be a Rival. It'll be one their ""rivals"". That'll show 'em!"
1,Not really programmable,"It over cooks because it never stops cooking! Even on ""warm"" the food is still cooking (burning)! I am back in the market for a crock pot - one that doesn't burn my food!"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,Thank goodness I've finally been validated! My mother in law bought this for me for Christmas and I was told I was being ungrateful when I said that it doesn't seem to work right. Every meal I have tried to cook in this has been dried out and tough. Now I feel like I can finally go out and buy a new one without feeling guilty about it since other reviewers have had the same problem.
1,"Never mind getting too hot, it didn't cook my food!","I got this slow cooker as a gift from my mom. I tried cooking a beef stew, and after 4-5 hours, the potatoes were still hard! I had to finish cooking it in a pot on the stove. I've read other reviews of how this slow cooker burned meals, but I couldn't even get it to fully cook mine. I think I'll be looking for a different brand for my next crockpot - not a Rival! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,This style had a manufacturing defect - contact Rival to replace,"We got one as a wedding gift - cooked way too hot. My aunt had the same pot and it boiled over onto her counter - it could have started a fire! We contacted Rival and there was apparantly a heating element problem in many of these units. They sent us a replacement crock pot for free. We opted to switch to the VersaWare because the stoneware was more versatile, and we're very happy. If you have the Smart Pot and it cooks hot, you should contact Rival immediately. They were very good about it all."
1,"Running, not walking...","...to return this. Dried, nasty chicken. Had to add liquid 4 times yesterday (defeats the purpose of leaving a slow cooker while I'm at work.) When it switches to ""warm"", the food is barely edible...lukewarm is a euphemism...almost downright cold. Low cooks too hot, warm chills it down. I'm so disappointed."
2,"It's not me, it's the slow cooker!","I thought I must be doing something wrong until I read these reviews. This slow cooker burned nearly everything I made in it, with the exception of soups. I would come home at the end of the day to find a burnt unrecognizable piece of coal instead of the roast I had been looking forward to. If you do get this, definitely use the Reynold's slow cooker bags or you will need a chisel to get the burnt-on food off of it."
3,The lid was a problem,"I've actually had 2 of these and although I didn't experience my food burning like many others seems to have, I did have an issue with the lid. On both, the plastic handle broke and there's no way to fix it. I have to put a towel or something over the hold where the handle used to be in order to keep the heat inside the slow cooker."
2,A year and that's it!,"We had this crock pot just under a year when it went kaput! Just happened to put in some beans and when my boyfriend came home durring lunch that day he said ""honey, weren't these supposed to be hot by now?"" The heating element is gone and it's no good. I got home that evening and stuck it where it belongs...in the garbage. This crock pot always burned everything, unless it was something like soup or beans with a ton of liquid. I always left the house to work wondering if I might come home to dry and burned food.I've been wanting a new one for a while and now this is just my exuse! I knew it wouldn't last too long. I'm not a fan of the buttons either, they wear out and the sticker starts pulling off. Look elsewhere people! Cheaper ones out there and better! I won't buy anything of this brand again."
2,Durability,"Have had one of these for about a year. Yes, little too hot. After a year all the plastic parts (side and lid handle) have become brittle and started to crack. The lid handle simple fell off. Attempts to find parts and to repair it have been in vain. This thing is now unsafe to pickup with the side handles when hot."
1,Cooks too hot!,This slow cooker is great in theory. It cooks too hot and has 'hot spots'. Would not recommend it.
1,Burns Everything,"Ive had this slow cooker for over a year now, and cook quite often with it. It burns absolutely everything I put in it if I dont watch it very carefully, which kind of defeats the purpose of a slow cooker. If a recipe has a cooking time for high in the slow cooker, I will set the crockpot on low and cook it for the amount of time the recipe says to cook it on high. I will not leave it unattended because it cooks so hot and I am afraid of it causing a fire."
1,"Horrible ""slow"" cooker","Do not leave unattended! This thing charred my meal after 2 hours on the LOWEST setting (was supposed to leave on 6 hours!). Not only that, but one side of the dish is definitely hotter than the other- one half was black and charred and the other half was just burned."
5,They Came In Ships,"There is an unbelievable amount of information packed into this book and it is organized in a way that works for both the experienced and new genealogist. I had almost given up finding my immigrant ancestors in several lines I'm researching until I discovered this gem. By following the step by step information given here, I was able to find them all! Don't overlook the bibliography. The information in it alone is well worth the price of the book. Thank you, Dr. Colletta!"
4,Good Reference Book,Such a big help with lots of good ideas to help you locate ancestors that came by ship. A very good reference book.
4,Pleased with information in book and speed of delivery,Very please with the speed of delivery and this book has a lot of information about how to search for the people who came in Ships to this country. I have started this process
2,Poor design,"I liked the idea of the filtered tap water cooler, but Brita's design is poor. I am only able to get a glass and a half of cold water (about 24 ounces), then you have to wait unless you don't mind drinking warm water. I have the thermostat turned to the coldest posistion, and the water is cool, but not cold. I don't like Brita's filters also, even after soaking them you still get the black specs in your water for the first bottle or two of water.The only thing I did like was the endless hot water, why they couldn't do that with the cold is beyond me.I went and purchased the PUR brand hot/cold cooler, and that is 100% better. The water gets as cold as if it were kept in the fridge, and I can get more than a glass and a half of cold water. The PUR filters produced no charcoal bits at all."
3,A Bit Bulky,I enjoyed the style of the pendant and chain but it is to bulky to wear causally. I'll wear it for occasions but it's not right for every day use.
3,Not what I expected...,"The product is OK, not great. I got this to cover the railings on my patio so that when you walk by you can't see everything on my patio. The fencing is nice to look at and is the perfect hight/length, you can still see through it."
2,Not Worth The Money,"I threw these on my wishlist and was lucky enough to receive them as a gift. I was looking forward to bringing them to the office and allowing them to distract me from time to time. However, I've found since I originally brought them they have sat idle on my shelf.When I do turn them on to watch them, they just do the same thing I saw them do the time before (wave to each other, plunge the toilet, fight, fart, saw wood, vacuum, push each other, etc.). I quickly lose interest and they eventually shut off on their own.I think I would enjoy this product more if there was a mode where they turned on at random times for a moment or two at a time. This would give me a little distraction throughout the day. However, now they just sit turned off most the time because I forget they are there.Unless you see yourself getting a ton of entertainment from these, I would suggest passing on Cube World. I would much prefer a set of perpetual motion balls as a piece of cubicle entertainment."
2,9-year old played with it for about a week,"My son saw this on t.v. and wanted it so badly. It looked quite interesting. He quickly lost interest in it. When asked why, he said it was boring. I guess once he played with it a few times, there was nothing more to do with it. It just sits there and collects dust.I consider this a waste of money."
3,Not quite what I was expecting,Cute concept but the characters often do crude or mean things to each other.
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD-EARNED CASH ON THIS CRAP!!!,"When I saw this advertise I asked my dad to take me to the store to buy one. When I got home I was fasinated with it! After 2-3 days it was at the bottom of my ""to-do"" list. COME ON PEOPLE!!! THIS IS OLD SCHOOL! LOOK AT THE CRAPPY GRAPHICS!! BLOCKS???!!! I HATE IT NOW!! By now, I think the makers should wake up and use COLOR!!!!!"
4,Great for those who do not like tree stands,I received this product as a gift from my parents for Christmas a few years ago. I am not particularly fond of hunting in a tree stand so this worked perfectly for me. The setup is easy however I would suggest using a ratchet strap in order to secure it better. Other than that this has helped greatly while hunting. It even can fit in my hunting bag. In the end I liked it enough to purchase the exact model for my dad the next year.
4,el tri ya es leyenda....,"Un buen disco lleno de buenas rolas,,,,ya aqui el grupo deja de estar en lo underground y es conocido mas en todos lados....este disco trae rolas como ""casa comida y sustento"", ""viejas de vecindad"" pero la rola que te hace llorar y la mas buena en mi opinion es ""millones de niños"",,una rola que reafirma la preocupacion de Alex con respecto a este problema social y sigue el ejemplo de ""el niño sin amor"" y ""pobre de los niños"".....este disco apesar de tener muy buenas rolas y a pesar de estar bien elaborado no tuvo tanto exito como otros ... vale la pena tenerlo"
1,you should be more careful in exploiting people's hope for cure!,"I am more than disappointed. The content of the DVD is absolutely of no help. Says nothing more than trivia. And people like me paying a fortune to collect dvd's like that, waiting them eagerly, just to find out that some guy with no scientific credentials, appearing on the screen just to sympathize (which i do not doubt, sincerely) and say that we should eat healthy foods and get a good sleep, after repeating a hundred times:""i will reveal to you my secret formula, 100% guarantee blah,blah,blah'. Really, bying this dvd was something i have clearly regreted and undermined my intelligence."
4,good idea for temporary install,I bought this to use on my upstairs blacony when the grandkids were coming for a few days. I ended up connecting the roller end to the wall with 2 cup hooks and then just tying the other end to the end of the railing. It worked wonderful and was removed easily when the kids were gone.
1,"Good idea, poor fastening mechanism","Retractable barrier was perfect height for my deck. However the screen was slack at the top and tight at the bottom despite being level. Biggest problem, and reason I returned, was the faulty snaps that hold the barrier open. There are three heavy duty snaps on the leading edge of the barrier that hold it open (you screw the receiving pieces onto the wall). The initial attachment was strong, the barrier held firmly in place. But the first time I unsnapped the buttons the top two came disconnected from the barrier, rendering it useless. I even followed the instructions specifying the proper way to unsnap, but they popped right off, as if the rivets holding them on were too weak. If they can fix the manner in which this attaches to the opposite wall (and just as importantly detaches), then this would be a great product."
1,flimsy,flimsy and not good for what i needed it for. would not hold up i don't think. i returned it.
5,Excellente Concierto un disco FANTASTICO Y MEMORABLE!,"Este disco es una formidable produccion absolutamente todas las canciones y los arreglos musicalesincluidos hacen que este disco sea un clasico en la musica pop en espanol,y muy probablemnte Miguel Bose Jamas vuelva a producir un disco como este Concierto en Barcelona, lo recomiendo a todos escucharlo.ninguna de sus producciones o materiales antes o despues de este disco tienen la calidad y la entrega que el puso en este disco."
4,Great CD.,"This music brings back a lot of good memories, from that awkward time in music between hair bands and Seattle grunge. About half of the songs are truly worthless and I don't know how they made it onto a CD like this, but the other half are gems and make the CD worth owning. In my opinion, Pearl Jam's ""Even Flow"" and Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" (or at least one of their other songs) should have at least receieved an honorable mention."
5,K'Aatsina: A Novel of Rebellion,"Ms. Harrigan has done it again! This novel, like her previous one, Acoma: A Novel of Conquest, is an engrossing read alive with wonderful characters in an exotic time and place. No one makes history come alive the way Harrigan does. I eagerly await whatever is next from this very talented writer."
4,Ameristep Grizzly Ladder Stand 15',"Nice stand for the money. The arm rest feature on this stand provides a level of insurance against slipping off the edge of the seat. The foot area and seat could be a bit wider and the step sections could have anti-separation pins, but these features would probably added cost to a very inexpensive unit. D.J."
2,a bit too sappy for me,"I never, ever read romance novels, I find them a bit corny. But I went on a library book shopping spree and bought this for a dime, so I had to read it. Low and behold I was correct, romance novels are terribly corny and quite predictable. The entire book is just simply retarded. I don't know how I was able to finish this in one day, perhaps because the story required no thought and/or reasoning to get through it.I'll give it 2 stars, however, because part of the story, the ghost idea was funny, but not because it was meant to be. It was stupid funny, like ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"" or ""Dude Where's My Car."" I just couldn't imagine that even in a group of complete idiots, someone would come up with an idea like that.To all those sappy love people who read romance, maybe this is something for you. To everyone else, I say pass it up and read a good story, that includes a genuine romance along with other story attributes."
1,Poorly Researched,"Although I suspected ""Love Overboard"" would be fluff, I bought it for a quick read on a flight. The story was set on the mid-coast of Maine. I was correct-it was pretty lame. However I stopped reading when one of the main characters spotted a pelican flying over the schooner, near Camden, Maine! I have never heard of a pelican ever flying over Maine waters. Just another detail which makes this book unreadable."
3,Love Overboard,"I prefer Janet's other books the Full Series , Plum Books and the Metro girl. I do not think this was as good but I understand she wrote this in the 1980's"
3,"Surprise, Surprise","Ms. Evanovich has swept me away with the blue skys of Maine and the wavery waters of the seaside. I imagined myself there. The story and plot was a new and interesting one and the ending was definitely a surprise. It isn't her hit Plume series, but its not a bad read.If you're looking for a different and exciting novel, read LUST OF THE FLESH by Beverly Rolyat. A story about district attorney, Nick Allapapalaus, who finds himself caught up in a web of lust, deceit, mystery, suspense, betrayal, murder and sex galore. Is he really the biological father of his ex-wife's promiscuous teenage daughter's infant son? Or has he been set up? A compelling, riveting, engaging, pageturning novel. Enjoy!"
1,I agree with the other 1 star reviews...,"I am a huge Stephanie Plum fan. I have all of the books in Paperback (1-14) and have read most of them numerous times. I tried to read ""Love Overboard"". I borrowed it from a friend. Honestly, I don't think I got past 2 chapters. I was incredibly disappointed. I could not get into it enough to want to read it. Way too tame for a Janet book. I'll stick with my Stephanie."
2,don't bother,"clearly written before Ms. Evanovich got her craft honed, it was frankly a great dissapointment....no Stephanie Plum that's for sure."
1,Please stick to PLUM!,"Fans of the Stephanie Plum novels will be VERY disappointed! I would wonder if these were even the same authors, however, Ms. Evanovich has recycled a few of her favorite sayings and character types (i.e. even the main characters have the same name...Stephanie!). I wish Ms. Evanovich would spend less time writing/rewriting different series and put out MORE Plum novels! Now those are worth reading!"
2,This is why you should let the past stay past,"Not the best JE book I've ever read. To be honest, this book, like Rocky Road to Romance was more like a Sweet Valley High book on very weak steriods. But then, what else can you expect from something originally published as a ""Loveswept Paperback"" in 1989?Do not, I repeat DO NOT pick this book up on the Authors name alone. This isn't Janet Evanovich. Not the one we've come to know and love through her Plum series.Disappointing and a waste of a good few hours of your time. Re-read one of the early Plum books. You'll have more fun and save 7 bucks."
3,"""Cute, fast, funny.""","Previous reviewers pretty much captured it. The plot is lame, the characters likeable enough to make for an enjoyable fluffy read. Evanovich's writing has enough life to it to entertain even when flawed (as we see in some Plum moments). The herioine, by the way, was committed to saving herself for marriage, but soon saw the error of her ways and got it on with Ivan the pirate. You won't be forced to endure any disturbing scenes of marital sex in this novel."
4,Great Weekend Read!,"I'm use to the Stephanie Plum series of mystery novels by Ms. Evanovich. So, I was recently surprised to learn that Ms. Evanovich has written quite a few romance novels.So, I read this book out of sheer curiosity to see how Ms. Evanovich's romance novels compare with her mystery novels. ""Love Overboard"" is a cute, light, fast and funny read! It's just perfect for a weekend escape from reality. The characters in this novel were great fun and very likeable. There were also a few plot surprises along the way that made this book fun to read. Highly recommend this book.... Enjoy!"
4,"Quick, Fun Romance Novel","Stephie Graf...Janet Evanovich...they're all good!At first I thought this was supposed to be a period piece and I wondered how I was going to like it, so I was so glad to read that it was in current times and just aboard a renaissance boat.This story was funny, quick paced, and fun to read. It had a bit of mystery and intrigue with ghosts and flying corpses. It has some romance and some denial of sexual attraction. It makes for fun reading and is classic Evanovich."
2,"Nice looking mill, but flawed design","While the mill itself is of nice design, in a handsome natural cherry, with an ample chamber for salt, the mechanism that determines the coarseness of the ground salt is poorly designed. It does not hold it's ""locked"" position in spite of claims to the contrary, and requires frequent readjusting. Knowing this, I would not purchase this item again."
4,wise child comments,"I enjoyed the story, but did not like the ending...it left one hanging not knowing if their child was going to get better or not, ther should have bee more of the story before it ended"
3,Alternative buy,"Before shelling out for this, check outJoined Together: The Complete Studio Duets, which contains everything here, remastered, plus a second album and bonus tracks"
1,Waste of Time and Money!,"The book offers a very interesting history of Crash Bandicoot. It also has cool pictures, interesting interviews, and very well organized. Anyone see what I'm leaving out- strategy. It hardly gives you any advise. For some of the hardest parts of the game, such as Death and Gem Paths, it gives about 2 sentences about it basically telling you that it will be tough. Thanks, but I figured that out myself- how about some advice on how to get through the death route instead of ""Yeah, its hard. Good luck."" What a waste of money."
5,quick delivery,"Glad this is available through mail order. Hard to find in retail pet stores here. Fast delivery. You need to separately purchase a syringe to administer. Seems to be effective in young cats with one dose, but my vet recommends a 1 tsp dose, 1 week apart, for 2 weeks."
5,In loving memory of Jason Raize,"Jason Raize had the potential to become one of the greatest singers/actors of all time, and I think this cd proves it. He had a soulfull voice that drew you in. I can only imagine that he must of been a tourtured soul underneath it all to have done that. To commit suicide in your prime you must have a good reason. I hope your in a better place Jason. You will always be remembered. In loving memory of Jason Raize."
5,Good for beginners,"I bird in the NW US using this guide. I began birding in early 2007 and this was recommended by the master birders in my local Audubon society. I used a copy of a Peterson guide in Europe and the Sibley is much easier and logical. It's an excellent companion book to my own book, 40 Excuses to Get Together with the Girls if you're working on Excuse #10 (Because I want to know that bird's name)."
2,Not great for the field,"While the Big Sibley Guide mostly deserves the praise it has received, the smaller Field Guides are a disappointment. They don't have the great knack that Peterson's, for example, has for giving you the precise few things you need for quick identification in the field.For instance, I recently visited southern California for the first time and saw cormorants with blue throat patches. My Sibley Field Guide was not particularly helpful. Upon returning home, I saw that my other guides, Peterson, National Geographic, Golden, made it clear that it was Brandt's cormorant in its breeding plumage. A fine point, perhaps, but an unforgivable omission in a book that aspires to be a standard reference. I won't take it out into the field anymore."
4,"Sits on my desk at work, ready...",I have this on my desk at work for that time when I look out and see those new and exciting birds in the tree outside my office. A great distraction from work.
5,The standard,"Sibley's is simpley the new standard for bird books. I have many other bird books, but this is the only one I cary to the field."
5,Loved it!,I think this is an excellant bird guide. I'd recommend it to anyone who is just starting out as a birder or is a lifetime lover of birds.
1,Find the original...,"The Blessed Virgin herself gave us the Holy Rosary. John Paul II decided to add these ""Luminous Mysteries"" (though, to his credit, he stated they were optional). Even so: Was he so arrogant to think that he could improve on something given to us by the Mother of God?? Once those are added, it's no longer the Rosary.The text of the original version is available on the Internet, and is in a convenient table form. It can be handily printed out and used to help meditate on the Mysteries of Our Lady's Rosary.Ave Maria!"
4,Ascending Into A Good Read!,"""Celeste Ascending"" by Kaylie Jones is a very book that hooked me from the first page. This deep and powerful tale of a woman's search for her own identity. She's living the life that everyone ""thinks"" they want but, she soon discovers that it's not all she wants it to be. People, Places, and Circumstances force her to reevaluate everything around her. The question becomes, will she be able to save herself or is she headed for disaster?This book is deeply honest and so well written. Her writing style is like a poem. She chooses her words so carefully and I found myself so enchanted by this book. Certainly not for someone looking for a quick read. It's deep and engrossing. Give yourself time with this one. It's worth the extra effort."
3,A journey to sobriety,"This novel could have been called Drinking: A Love Story but that title is already taken by an excellent non-fiction book. Jones knows alcoholism. She knows that ""skid row"" may be in a beautiful apartment with a gold card in your purse and a giant rock on your left ring finger. She knows the allure of that one more drink. Her men and women are somewhat superficial but interesting. You do want to find out what happens next. I tried very hard to put this book down shortly after deciding it must be what a Jackie Collins book was like (sex, drugs, drinking, multiple men, money) except with a protagonist who is working on a doctorate. But I was hooked and now I am glad I was. I enjoyed reading this book. It would be a great beach book, and I would think a good train book."
4,Terrific...to a point,"I read this book in just a few days - I couldn't put it down. I was totally absorbed in Celeste and the people in her life, present and past. However, although I won't give away the ending, I was disappointed by it. The journey of self-discovery that Celeste is on does not end passionately or with any kind of real resolution. The story just kind of fizzles out in a few pages of self-help chatter. Other than that, it's very well-written and I was hooked."
5,"A well-told, ultimately hopeful tale","I've been a fan of Kaylie Jones's for years...I studied with her, gone to her readings, and was privileged to read an early draft of this work.As a reader, what I enjoyed most about Celeste Ascending is the incredibly tight and well-structured narrative drive, which whips you through the book. You MUSt know what happens next.The characters are complex and real...no one is absolutely evil or has the best intentions at all times. Celeste hooks up with Alex, a wealthy, controlling man, because she thinks she needs the things he has to give her. There are places where they touch each other...and other places where they strike sparks and you can sense impending disaster.Ultimately, what holds the story together is Celeste's journey, as she draws from the disparate threads of her life to find common themes and find a way to heal herself."
1,Thank Goodness it's [Allegedly] Over,"I only read this awful book to see if all the five star reviews were right in saying it was better than that horrible piece of garbage, the Fifth Sorceress.Bottom Line: It's not. It's worse.This series started off with so much hype it would be almost impossible to live up to it, but Newcomb manages to make all the amateurish writing in the world seem professional by comparison. ""Whump! Whump! Whump!"" Oh for goodness' sake.Please, Robert Newcomb, like Ashlee Simpson, give up trying. It's not your field."
4,Definately NOT the End,"After reading the editorial review by Publisher's Weekly I expected this book to be a letdown.It was not.Newcomb's style of writing seems to be improving in each volume. And since there are three more volumes after this one(at least) I can not wait until the others come out.I think that he had a three book deal(originally) to Del Rey may have made it appear that it was a trilogy.Since book four is already titled Savage Messiah and book 5 and 6 listed for future I think we will have quite a few more adventues in ""The Chronicles of Blood and Stone"""
1,Waste of paper,I had the misfortune of by this book.I got it from a library sell. I could not finish it. He is one of the worst writers I've ever read.
1,"she is thick, but the song is wack to me",Kelis is truly Great Eye Candy but vocally She ain't worth a Half a Piece of Juicy Fruit.this Neptunes Production is fairly typical&after a while you heard One Neptunes Production you heard a 100.this song is catchy once in a while but the Video is the Main selling Point.
3,OK,"the beats on this are tight by The Neptunes and the song is ok, and thats all I have to say about that"
1,This Song Sucks,I like milkshake with ice cream and milk but this song sure does suck on so many levels !Didn't your career died 10 years ago ?
2,Wait for the bargain bin on this one.,"Trade Empires isn't different enough from other, older strategy games for me to recommend it. The game's biggest lacks are personality and originality. As I watched my trade routes increase and my markets grow, I felt no sense of accomplishment. New items and options that are added as your empire grows don't seem to add anything new to the ""feel"" of the game as a whole. In addition, everything is so small and bland-looking, much like strategy games that were released several years ago. I never felt a pressing need to finish one more task or to continue playing. The ... price tag is too high for a game that doesn't really add anything new to the strategy genre. If you can later find the game for ... in the bargain bin, it might be worth a look."
2,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,This is the first time I gave a bad review for a game.The reasonthat Trade Empires only got 2 stars is lack of interest.First of all the scenarios are way to micromanaging (in other words hard)and when you do get something right there is no fanfare not evena pup up video.The graphics are lame the wagon that goes all over the map is so tiny it looks like a ant.No zoom featureand the status bar is also confusing.So if you want a quick orat least enjoyable trip through history get AOK or EE.
4,No esta mal,"Sanz demuestra que puede hacer mas pero que todavia esta muy verde y en vez de querer birncar a un lugar que no le coresponde, toma su posición y no trata de aparentar nada mas de lo que es: un tipo guapo cantando canciones faciles. Quiza si uno se vuelve muy observador se da cuenta de supontencial pero este dicos es mejor disfrutarlo sin lupa en mano. Son canciones sensillas pero buenas. Como para pasar una hora de musica diregible pero sin ser artificial."
4,Excellent Video for Armchair Bwanas,"This video is a excellent video for all of hunters who want to hunt Africa but cannot afford it. The professional hunter,Ronnie Sparrow ,does a good job of explaining what to look for in trophy animals. I really enjoyed the video but found the main hunter to be a little annoying but not enough to take away from whole expierence. I have watched the video several times and only problem was each time I come away wanting to hunt Africa even more than before"
3,Half and Half,"The first six tracks are listenable, but the last tracks are not. I have deleted those tracks from my collection of Evans, which is nearly everything he recorded. That said, one would be well advised to select nearly anything else from his catalog in preference to this album, especially his earliest on Riverside and his last on Warner and Milestone."
1,A Terrible Album,"Even though there was a disclaimer (in small print) on the back of this CD advising that the recording was done by amateur equipment, LoneHill stated that they felt the historical value of the recording made it worth producing. Bull! This CD was so bad that I could not listen to all of it. At times I thought I was listening to a kazoo when it was actually Bill Evans playing the piano. The background noise sounded like someone rubbing two pieces of sandpaper together. It was like listening to fingernails scraping on a blackboard (for those of you who know what a blackboard is). Do NOT waste your money on this CD and be wary of others by this Spanish company, LoneHill. Fortunately, I had purchased it through Amazon, and even though I had opened the packaging to play it, they graciously refunded my money."
2,"Expensive, weak","I used this with my Sanus VMDD26B. For $90, I expect to get a bit more substantial structure. Now it's set up, it's holding up the speaker. It does flex a bit, though. Also, the bolts do not fit because of the paint in the bolt-holes, which chips when putting the screws in. And, with the spacing of the mounting holes in my Sony 52"" XBR5, I had to cut the Support Bar (the thin horizontal piece in the picture), unmount the VMCC1B, and re-install it. Also, it assumes your center channel speaker has mounting bolt holes... neither of mine do, I need to use wood or sheet metal screws, which are not included. Also, the instructions are cryptic at best, mostly pictograms that don't have coherency."
1,D. Wilcox,Sorry to say this drill did not last one day it failed before I could finish the project I was building. If you choose to buy it I hope you will have better results than I did.
4,Well...,"OK, there's nothing wrong with these fret wires. But I do feel the need to let people know that if you're NOT a professional and for some reason get it into your head that just because you've installed locking tuners on your guitar and watched a bunch of youtube videos you're now thinking to yourself ""Yeah I can replace the three worn out frets on this thing,"" that I hope you're doing it on a guitar you don't mind wrecking.I got it done, and from a distance you can't even tell the difference, but it is NOT an easy or simple tasks. If you don't have a fret press SPECIFICALLY MADE to get frets into the fingerboard, getting them in is NOT going to be easy (I improvised one out of a vice-grip, some rubber strips and a bunch of foam).If you're not a VERY handy person who has done this kind of thing before, and you care about your guitar, have a professional do this."
5,Alumaseal worked for me,I have had a small coolant leak from the motor on my BMW 735IL since I bought the car second hand 6 years ago. I had to top up the radiator about 1 cup full weekly. Recently I investigated the leak and it was seen to come somewhere from the back of the motor. The consensus was to remove the gearbox and find the leak with a possible cost of $1000. I bought some Alumaseal for $3 and the leak completely stopped. Can't ask for more than that.
1,"ALUMASEAL, ENDED UP JUNKING THE CAR!",Terrible stuff. I ended up buying a car. The company has not answer my complain. My mechanic said that the reason was that I used that stuff Alumaseal. Then I complained to the company in the mail with pictures and explanations and they never answer back. I went to buy a new radiator but when I brought it to the mechanic he told me to forget it. It was worst than he thought. Alumaseal blocked the radiator and water leaked into the engine block with the oil. So I ended up junking the car. ALUMASEAL IS TERRIBLE DONT BUY IT! NOT EVEN A STAR.
3,Unsatisfied,I bought this organizer about 1 year ago. At first I really loved the simplicity of the organizer and how compact it is. Now my LCD screen is malfunctioning and I have to buy a new one.
1,Not really what I was expecting,"I've heard Ra spin before and I really expected a lot more. This compilation has too many of the la la sing-a-long high energy 1AM vocals...I was expecting short, haunting repetetive, electronic vocals mixed with a deep, dark, progressive house beat. If that's what you're looking for also, skip this one."
3,Great Expectations,"Hakim is simply amazing. He is a strong performer with a true gift. But, however much I like Hakim, his performance in this album was not as strong as I would have hoped. Listening to the live recording is a bit depressing actually. In terms of artistry, Hakim deserves a full five stars, but the harsh and repetitive sounds of this recording wear on the ears, making it difficult to listen to and causing it to lose two stars in the process. For a novice to the genre who appreciates a cleaner, stronger, and less strident sound, one of his other records might be best to start with. For a true fan of Hakim and Arabic music who is able to look beyond the flaws and truly appreciate the artistry of the music, this is a must-have."
4,great!,"I love it! looks great, feels great. The face is quite thin but still feels very solid. definately a good buy!"
2,Pulp Fiction Novella based on the Finnish Kalevala,"The amnesia hero's name is Ilmar, and he's found drifting on asteroid in deep space near a matter dissolving space-storm. He's picked up by a passing space-ship. His body gives off the same type of matter-eater radiation the storm does, and everybody on board but him dies. Earth's government quarantines him and sentences him to be sent into the sun to save humanity from being dissolved. That's part one.In part two, Ilmar's real elf-alien-people rescue him and help remember his heroic past. He sets out a second time to confront the space-witch at the heart of the storm.That's it. Book is 128 pages total.Technology is simply wrong (this was written in 1966), and characterization is bad. Really bad. I recommend reading a translation of the Finnish ""Kalevala, the Land of Heroes"" as you'll enjoy it more. The author used direct quotes for probably half his dialogue."
5,scarey & exciting,"Frightening and insightful view, of just what ""might"" happen in the near future. All of the possible ramifications are hard to contemplate."
1,Low Level Fiction,"As a Y2K remediation consultant, I was looking for a few laughs when I ordered this book. However, I didn't buy into the premise for one second, and I barely made it halfway through. What a waste. The book requires you to believe that no one has ever heard of the millennium bug until the clocks strike midnight, and that no work is underway to head off this problem. What bull! There may be some disruptions, but believe me we're not going to experience The Day the Earth Stood Still as Kelly predicts. The author is simply fanning mass hysteria to sell books. Had he done his homework, Kelly would have referenced the billions already invested and the countless man-hours spent by people a lot smarter than his hero to head off problems. But it's Kelly's writing style that finally gives him away: amateur. Obviously the book is self-published. No editor worth her salt would allow this self-indulgent prose to reach the printed page."
2,Too Little Logic,"No vehicles work except 30-year-old ones, yet none of the roads are clogged with stalled cars? Everything's shut down, but there's almost no looting? Kelly needs to study his history."
3,The best bad book you'll read this year...,"Horribly written, laden with cliches -- Visionary businessman meeting resistance at every turn, security man yearning for love, kid genius, etc. -- and absurdly paranoid -- The company in the story is ""the only company still operable after New Year's Eve 1999."" The US will be invaded by China due to a traitor in our midst... -- , Nonetheless, a good book for it's absurdity value alone. I recommend waiting till after y2k though... It'll be in every used book store's $.25 bin come 1/1/2000."
1,"Shallow, weak, obvious - A total disappointment","Poorly written, unimaginative, and only thinly based on a Y2k scenario, this novel is the embodiment of a missed opportunity. Instead of really exploring the fascinating possibilities of a disaster story based on the worst case scenarios of Y2K, this is a silly exploration of the possibility that China would try to exploit our military lack of preparedness. Which might have been interesting had it been written better. Among the many irritating plot points: the ridiculous portrayal of a single Y2K-repair firm as the one and only salvation of the planet. An enormous disappointment, time completely wasted."
1,"instead of y2k, bad tom clancy like writing","cheap shot - instaed of sticking to the idea kelly takes an easy escape and does a tom clancy look alike with lots of guns blazing etc etc. only he isn't tom clancy (even though he is evidently already planning the sequel...war and everything, isn't that special...). after finding the first two or three chapters sort of interesting, i got bored. the topic deserves better - don't buy the book."
2,Clancy wannabe with doomsday vision,"If the purpose of this book is to convince me to stock up on groceries, withdraw my money from the bank and buy a generator, it failed. I think if the author intended to bring attention to real or perceived dangers of the Y2K bug, his time would have been better spent on non-fiction."
4,"Not great writing, but couldn't put it down","OK, so it's not great by literary standards. I still couldn't put it down. It helps focus my Y2K thinking, even without buying into the over-hyped drama. Now, if only I could find good Y2K investment books."
1,A WASTE,"This book is a waste of time, money, and effort. Great effort is needed, I assure you, as the writing is so poor that you will be tempted many times to throw the thing at the wall.It is a page-turner in the sense that one wants, at all costs and with incredible speed, to be done with it forever. I do not recommend this book. I cannot recommend it. If you are interested in learning about Y2K, you would be better off buying a non-fiction work such as that by Yourdon."
4,One of the best 'What-If's' in recent years,"I'm listening to the audio production of ""Y2K"" and despite the highly unusual speaking voice of the reader, he manages to convey the right mixture of menace, mayhem, and Orson Wellesian ""Martian Landing"" hysteria attached to the Y2K problem. People who have attacked this book as unduly alarmist are not really answering the question raised by the author. If even 10% of the catastrophes take place, we are in for a weird New Year's Day in 2000. No one can say with any definite accuracy that the lights will not go out, the phones will fail, and embedded chips will render most of our machines useless. And the critic who accused Kelley of racism in his description of the L.A. riots --- sorry if the truth hurts, folks. I was in L.A. during the riots of '92; Kelley has nailed the tensions accurately. When will anyone in authority tell us that we do not have to worry at all about Y2K? God help those who still have their heads buried in the sand on Dec. 31, 1999."
1,I was disappointed.,"As another reviewer pointed out, the topic deserved better. It started out OK, but got so dull I could hardly finish it. Some action and dialogue was completely unbelievable. Just as I was reading the part where Rush Limbaugh was a hero for telling the truth about the severity of Y2K, the real Rush had announced that it was all hype, making a fool of the author. Instead of telling us realistic stories about what might happen, it was a macho fantasy shoot-em-up. Do read about Y2K, but don't read THIS book."
2,Disappointing,"I really wanted to understand Sotos. I do not share in the majority of his philosophies, but that just made me more curious about where this guy is coming from. I still don't know. He's obviously intelligent and at times, articulate, but he doesn't have enough restraint to explain himself. It all just turns into a big rant about child rape/porn and other social taboos.I wonder if he's really into these deviant acts or if he just gets off on being subversive. He really doesn't make a strong point. He just sounds like someone who had severe childhood trauma and has absolutely no capacity for empathy or compassion. I don't think he's evil or even necessarily dangerous. He just needed more love as a kid and not the kind that includes penetration."
4,Great value,Love the screen divider. Already assembled so I could use it right away.Put it behind our TV to divide the room & looks great. Quick delivery too!
5,Wow,"Four panels that swing in either direction. They look great. Completed the Japanese look I wanted in a bedroom. Solid and well constructed for the money. I have searched everywhere and even locally and was not able to to beat the price. In addition, they shipped them super fast. Excellent purchase!"
4,Well made highly functional,Good solid opaque but light weight easy to store; use rhese in a gallery to hide exhibits before the unveiling. Quality materials
5,Shoji Screen,The Shoji Screen suits my purpose perfectly and it's very attractive. I use it as a divider between my granddaughters bedroom and playroom.
3,Ok... I guess,"Seller: FurnituremaxxWell packed, arrived undamaged and very quickly.Divider:Looking pretty sleek on the outside, but made of a paper-like material and plain white on the inside. I expected to have a brick-looking divider on both sides. Also, I would prefer it be a little heavier for more stability. Otherwise - it does the job."
4,Great value,"Needed a privacy screen for our co-op and after much searching found this one which was bigger and priced very reasonable. Screen is working wonderful even on the low pile carpet, looks nice also."
1,my second review since they deleted my first review,"i wrote my first negetive review and they called and asked if i can take it off and they will pay me back half the price for this divider, so i went on here to decide and it was gone already so im guessing they took it off already without my consent and without returning money back either.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DIVIDER. it looks cheap in person and practically falls apart when you try to make it stand. not worth the money at all."
4,Good for the price,The price is right and it looks pretty good. There's a bit of space between the sections but all the ones I saw in the store were the same way and a lot more expensive.Definitely would recommend.
3,"Cheap, basic, and functional",Just received it today. I immediately noticed that the screen gives off a strong paint/chemical smell. Airing it out as we speak. Hope the smell disappears with a little fresh air. The screen is very basic. Design is only on one side. Made in Vietnam apparently. Mine arrives with no damage. I will update this review as needed.
4,really pretty but wrong color,I really like these walls. I got cherry instead of black but I like the color so I am keeping them. I would recommend. Light and fragile. Take care.
4,better than expected!,"We have been very pleased with this screen. It arrived quickly, and well packaged. It is attractive and sturdy. The paper has ripped a bit, but I think that is more of a function of my teenage sons than the quality of the screen. I am very pleased with the screen and would definitely recommend this screen from this company."
4,"good prize, good buy","good prize, good buy. coming pretty soon, and it's worthily buying aha, an advice is that have more doors room dividers, such as 4 or 5 doors coz the wide isn't enough though"
2,Disappointed,"I bought two of these room dividers, and within weeks my 5 lb yorkie busted a hole right through one of them. I understand it isn't made of steel, but I didn't expect my little dog to be able to damage it so easily. I spent a nice chunk of money for it to last only weeks."
4,Nice divider,"I bought this divider to partition of some rooms in my home and give it a nicer look. It did just that. It looks stylish and simple. Is a great size for my needs. The only thing I worry about is that it will get dusty and the white portion will become dingy looking. Kind of wish the white paper was a bit more on the tan side. I live in the desert and dust is present at an alarming rate. Well, we will just have to see."
4,"Good, inexpensive product","These dividers are pretty and inexpensive. The slats are only on one side, and they do break fairly easily, I've discovered, but so far the rice paper has withstood a house with 3 kids. For the price, I think this is a good product."
2,I LOVE IT BUT........there are not enough hinges and it bowed in the middle of all panels,"They did replace it immediately upon receiving my complaint but I'll have to see if the new one does the same thing. It's NOT the construction of the panel, it's the 2 hinges rather than 3 or 4 that would make it stable."
5,Fit the bill,Very pleased with the product. It serves the purpose very well and looks very attractive as well. I've received many compliments.
1,terrible product,came damaged--had to jump through a ton of hoops to return.dont bother--cheap product with TONS of other alternative screens
4,Pretty good,Pretty good for the function. Not super refined depend on how demanding you need. Just the shipment is little bit of too expensive. Hope there would be little something like a fixer and stand holder to make it more stable while stand up on the floor.
5,excellent,"Excellent, and FAR below other prices -- I am re-doing several rooms, and will be ordering more...too many words required for review"
4,Divider for great space!!,We decided to purchase this product after checking many stores and websites. We buy this for our new apartment's bedroom. We have moved into a Bathroom inside the Bedroom for the first time. My sisters in law love it when we have the House Warming party. This product gives the good height and length for the space we like to seperate. I have recommended it to all my family and friends.
3,India 1870s,"(from another's review): ""England and the Orient; or, Scenes, Incidents, and work, during An Evangelistic Tour round the World for the Promotion of Christian Holiness"" by Mattie Sisson Wood.

1,Might as well be spraying water,"The first time I sprayed this on my furniture, my cat trotted right over and spent five minutes smelling the furniture. It did not repel him at all and had no affect on his scratching behavior. I later tried theSticky Paws Tapeand had success with that, although it looks really bad having strips of tape on the furniture. I really would have liked for this repellant to work, but I could have had the same results from spraying water on my furniture."
1,Not worth the money,"I sprayed No Scratch on the area where my two cats started scratching. They walked over to see what I was doing, sniffed the area, sat down and looked at me like I was crazy. Yeah, I caught one of them scratching just about an hour later. Don't bother with this product."
1,"Almost as effective as water, only harder to apply","I've tried this several times over the years. The cats me spray it watch with mild curiosity (or amused contempt; it's hard to tell for sure), wait for me to move out of the way, and then re-mark their territory.That's the good news. The bad news is that the pump sprayer was designed for use by King Kong: I'm just not strong enough to push it down with my thumb, and have to use the heel of my hand. So, the spray goes on my hand, but the cats don't seem to mind: they sniff the hand, then want me to pet them.Maybe this stuff's actually catnip?"
1,Save Your Money,"Our experience has been very much like that of the other reviewer. Our two cats hated the hissing sound as we sprayed this product on surfaces, but otherwise seemed to have no reaction to ""No Scratch"" at all. Complete waste of money! I'd give it ZERO stars, if I could..."
1,save your money,i spent 10 dollars for this at petsmart...what a waste. it did absolutely nothing to deter my kitten from scratching my chair. save your money for something else. my vet recommended using perfume on furniture you don't want your cat to scratch.
1,Complete waste of money,Not only did it NOT keep my cat off expensive persian rugs...The bottle itself became a chew toy...
3,Stodgy,"Maybe I have a plebeian mentality, but I expect ""bazaar crafts"" to be cheap and cheerful, something that could just as easily be a stocking stuffer as an item for sale. This book was dull. The projects are all done with expensive materials with footnotes on how to cheapen them up for sale. There was a great variety of crafts-sewing, beading, crewel work, but they all seemed to have that same 'stuffiness' about them. The only way I can find to conclude this review is by quoting my husband. He looked the book over and said ""I don't care for it."""
4,I love this series,"IT is just such a make believe, almost magic, almost fantasy that i just fell in love with the series. It is NOT my type of books AT ALL, because i'd rather read more realistica stories. However, I was trying to find some cheap audiobooks for my communite and i happened to find the first book ""The Substitute Millionaire"". When i finished that one, i just wanted to know more about the other sisters and their own stories, so i ended up buying the whole series.I love Ryan and Julie and Kane and Willow...Now i am listening to Todd and Marina and i know for sure that i will like this story as well as the other ones.The other good thing about this series is that ALL BOOKS ARE OUT...so i dont have to wait, and wait and wait to know what will happened and/or follow up on a series. Again, this series are not anything out of this world...just few hours to stories that are far from be non-ficton."
2,the million dollar sprain,"ok the opening of the book is kinda dumb, what with willow running through the house and all. but when her and her sisters invade kane's house...that was a hoot. poor willow has always had fixer-upper men in her life and it looked like kane was more of the same. turns out he is, but not in the same way has her previous men and good thing too. good quick read. as with the other millionare series, read them for enjoyment, and put them in your give away pile for one of your friends to enjoy also."
4,Great Read,"I enjoyed reading this book it was quick and the characters were very likeable. I loved the way the hero supported the heroine against her father's insensitive comments and behavior.I also enjoyed reading the other two books in this serious, in order:1. The Substitute Millionaire2. The Unexpected Millionaire3. The Ultimate MillionaireThe third was my favorite, but the first two were great as well."
3,I know why they were on sale.,I bought these when they were on sale for $69. I couldn't believe I could get all 5 seasons for $13 each. I just opened the box and realized why they were so cheap.The plastic casing for Season 1 was all but obliterated.Season 2 had chunks missing and cracks everywhere else.Season 3 has a few small pieces missing and a few cracks.Season 4 has a severe gash in the cover and a cracked case under Disc 2.Season 5 managed to escape w/out major damage.The only reason I didn't score this lower is the discs are somehow still pristine despite the damaged packaging. It wasn't shipping issues because the box they came in was not damaged so they were wrapped up & put in the box damaged. This the first and hopefully last problem I've had with Amazon.Discs are a '5' the rest '1'
4,where are the special features?,"this is a great show. very enjoyable, quick-witted and highly entertaining. but not enough interviews with the cast and such. the themed featurettes dont cut it. also where are the subtitles from season 3 onwards?"
4,Good Book,"A very good book, you can learn from the experiences of the top coaches in the world from this book! Each chapter is written by a world class swimming coach, this however, in my opinion, makes the book a little confusing for less experienced coaches, because although all coaches apply the same principles of training, each one presents them in a different way."
4,Every Sidetracked Sister needs this book!,"If you are a follower of Pam & Peggy's wisdom, you should own this book. It gives more detail of their quest for organization, as well as taking us on a hilarious journey on the way there! Peggy's description of Danny's unknowing adventure of washing his hair in Woolite is delightful, as is Pam's surprise wedding toward the end of the book. Their homespun wisdom and humor will endear the Sidetracked Sisters to you. Their focus of this book is getting your family involved in cleaning up at home, and the infraction game that they've invented for offenders sounds promising. My favorite part of the book is the ending which talks about how a home isn't a home without the support of your loved ones, no matter how messy or clean it may be."
3,Before GYAT....,"This is pretty much the ""prequel"" to Get Your Act Together.... (aka GYAT). Most of the stories are repeats from Sidetracked Home Executives. If you have GYAT, skip on this one unless you are a real fan and/or find it at a yard sale cheap.The best part of the book is the appendix, where they have pictures of the ""cards"" and how they look when done. You could do something similar on the computer, and even add cute graphics if you wanted to."
5,great products,"i am writing this to let all you know that dual is a solid brand. i was skeptcal because they sell them at walmart, but i was wrong. i had a cheap boss amp, that worked for 1 day and died. so for a short term fix i grabbed a dual amp from walmart for 55 bucks. well, it has been months now, and im keeping it. it puts out the power it advertises, and has never failed. even when i stretch her legs quite a bit. dont doubt the brand. they are solid."
4,Easy Upgrade,"Installed yesterday on an '04 Frontier crew cab, located behind the back seat. It provided a tremendous improvement over the previous set-up, a Kenwood 22-watt RMS head unit and 4 Alpine door speakers. The amp appears to be well built, with clearly labeled terminals and controls.Used a Scosche 680 watt amp wiring kit, to which I added a 20-foot RCA-jack stereo cable for the rear channels. Also needed 4 lengths of speaker cable to run from the amp back to the dash to hook up to the speaker wiring. Grounded the amp to the rear wall of the cab. No problems with ground looping or alternator whine. The sound is clear at all volumes. I'm going to enjoy this.Gave it four stars because there are probably better amps out there, but those cost quite a bit more. For the money, this is a pretty good amp."
3,mediocre amp,"I've had two of these. The first was a used amp that didn't work properly. It only wanted to play 2 channels at a time.The second has held up for a while. It has lots of power for speakers. Not enough power for subs. I ran an infinity 10"" sub bridged for a whole minute before it clipped to death.My biggest complaint is that this amp puts out A LOT of noise. The signal to noise ratio is 75 DBA. Most amps are 90-100 dba. I find the noise level is way too noticeable, so I'll be upgrading to a kenwood amp in the next few months."
4,"About seeing your child with awe, raising her with patience.","This book uses one woman's experience as a seasoned caretaker to illustrate how to be with children ""through"" there emotions, rather than attempting to always distract them away from them. One of it's primary focuses is to encourage parents not to teach that some emotions are "" bad"" and some good. It made me more aware of attempting to see things from my children's perspective, to value their differences, respect their incredible ability to know what they need, and to see their unwillingness to ""be molded"" as a blessing. I read the entire book straight through, refer back to it often and give it as a gift when I can. It is not a strict ""how to"". If you are at all aware, you already know ""how to"", this book will guide you to that."
3,It's... there,"Having been trained in JKD, I bought this book to maybe reinforce some teachings, or hopefully learn something new.It makes a nice reference in case I forget the names of some moves, but aside from that, I couldn't really find a good use for it.Might be a good read for someone a bit newer to the art.Very good picture flow and explanations of moves."
3,Okay.,"Unlike his older books, this one is more specialized to jkd'ers (& maybe wing chun folks). Also, imo, the techs. shown for dealing with grapplers are not as strong/solid as those shown in his older books, or in material taught in his seminars. Prof. Hartsell is great, but this is not my favorite work of his."
2,Just trapping !!!,"The pretty negative review is based on the fact that the book is made of 95% trapping drills which are very very difficult to follow.The rest 5% is actually quite interesting as it covers fighting tactics against different opponents types (boxers, grapplers, karatekas, etc....) but the pages dedicated to that are the extreme minority.The book should have just been called: Advanced trapping exercises.Good if you are a trapping fan, but wasted time if you are much more ""street oriented"".Disappointed."
1,a cheap copy of My Chemical Romance,They are just a CHEAP copy of My Chemical Romance. I have to hear their bad music often because my little brother like it. Well i guess its not his fault he is just a kid.
2,Poor color reproduction inside book,"I was disappointed by the book and returned it. It has a nice variety of images, but they all look crummy. I bought the book based on the cover image (which, while a familiar scene, appeared to have good color saturation). And indeed the dust jacket is pretty, but the images inside are all washed out.I can't comment on the text."
5,Abduction Is An Excellent Read,"An excellent book to read on the topic. For those still skeptical also read ""DMT the Spirit Molecule by Rick Strassman"" to further read on the possible cause of some alien contact experiences. Overall Abuction the book centres on people undergoing hypnosis and retelling their stories and their effects on them. The emotional experiences that the subjects convey under hypnosis is one of the reasons to consider the reality of their experiences, again overlapping with experiences in Strassman's book."
3,A bit too much,"Not a bad read, however I find myself searching for the hypnotize segments and skipping the rest of the Dr. mumbo jumbo. Very interesting interviews with several people that did not know they were abducted till they were hypnotized for recollection."
5,The book scared me.,"I read the whole book and it really grabbed my attention. It made me worry that I would be abducted by aliens. I remember being scared after reading it late one night, thinking at any moment, an alien creature would walk through the window and abduct me. I do not frighten easily, but this book made me keep a night light on for a couple of weeks. It is a great piece of work on a world wide phenomenon. Read it with an open mind. Can hundreds of thousands of people around the world all be crazy? I think personally that we have been visited by EBE's throughout all of Earth's history and that we are a product of their creation. They are abducting so many of us to create human-alien hybrids that will colonize the Earth after a lot of us die off from an upcoming global disaster of some kind. Get this book now and be afraid, be very afraid."
1,Mack confuses dreams with reality.,"Mack does a good job of convincing himself that the experiences of his patients are true. However, he confuses perception with reality. I'm sure that the patients experienced something, but to make a leap of illogic and assume that hypnopompic hallucinations are alien abductions is foolish. I read several of the case studies and, although I am not a psychologist, found that his patients were suffering from real personal problems such as guilt over the inability to conceive a child and grief over the loss of a parent. Mack gathers these folks together in group therapy for several weeks where they can listen to each other and add to their initial hazy memories. Then he brings them back to his office and hypnotizes them to bring out the *experience*. Why do this when it is obvious that their problems are terrestrial? If you want to read this book (and judge it for yourself), borrow it from the library. Don't give John Mack a dime."
2,Mack has no BS meter.,"It's all well and good for people to be researching this subject. As an 'abductee' (that word just doesn't do it justice), my first thought when I heard Mack had finished his book was ""It's about damn time a major figure got into the field"". But then I got really ticked-off when I heard about his past life regression and other new-age consciousness theories. I read the book and was appalled that someone of his collegiate stature would be lured-in by this contactee bull dung. Sure enough, months go by and his contactees start admitting they made the stuff up. OF COURSE THEY DID! Anyone who thinks the...'things' act with ethical benevolence is either lying or delusional. The truth is bitter and unpleasant. Want to know what kind of crud goes on? Read David Jacobs' ""Secret Life"". I'll personally vouch for it."
1,Where was the enthusiasm?,"Very interesting new theories especially the hybrid developments. Have the abductees stepped over the line of truth/reality? John was contacted by a lot of people with almost identical patterns of abduction in a very short space of time. The English is flat, if not appalling (days before months please). Lacks pace, flow and enthusiasm, being more like a thesis of high intellectual. Having said this all ufologists will find something of interest here"
1,a load of nonsense,"this book should be title 'Penthouse Letters with Extraterrestrials'these people are nuts and shame on this doctorthese people seem to be victms of child abuse, rape and drug users.they need help not some quack doctor believing their hallucinations."
1,I Must Be Different,"This product receives rave reviews, but it was completely unusable to clone a new drive on my system. I tried to clone from my HP/Compaq Business Notebook NX-9005 20gb drive to a new WD 120gb drive. Following Apricorn's instructions just locked up the software before anything happened. I also tried installing the Apricorn software on the HP and running it from there, but got invalid partition error on the new, raw WD drive. I ended up cloning the hard, slow, old-fashioned way."
4,Excellent survey - outstanding contributors,Excellent survey of the past 30 years of OT research. Required reading if you want to understand the current state of OT theology in brief.
3,almost rewarding,"I did enjoy reading this book, however, within the introduction I was able to capture the author's position, and that position was a closed mind that simply stated that the Torah was absolute and contained God within. This position was absurd to me, however, from courtesy I read the book to see if he held that position event to the end. He did. I then evaluated the statement that he could write a book in 1 week and had written over 400 books. This led me to the conclusion that I would not see anything that would challenge my understanding, only continued rhetoric. If you are closed minded and believe in the absolute rules of the Torah, Bible, or Koran, then this book is for you, it will reinforce your position. If you are open minded and want to understand the close mindedness of your neighbor, this book is for you.Thank you for your story, Mr. Neusner. God loves you always."
3,I had to buy this book for my freshman classes,"To be honest, most of the things really didn't make sense. Sometimes there is a lot of skipping on information, other times I had to keep on reviewing the material 5 times just to see what the author is talking about. A programmer can not learn programming without having a hand-on approach, and this author uses classes that aren't even shown. How are we supposed to run these programs if we are missing the classes used to run these programs? I suggest a Dietel & Dietel book ""How to program in Java""; I had to buy that book in order to understand the analytical approach that Barnes used in his book. That is why I gave this rating a 3 stars, because Barnes does somewhat of a good job explaining, only if you have some kind of background information in programming before."
2,Does not help with your coursework after year one,"A note to UKC CS and CSE students.It will not help with your second year Networks assignment, which is officially 'not a java programming exercise'."
2,Just because people have a brain injury dose not mean they all want to kill or rape you,"I have read all Nelson DeMille's books but was very disappointed in this one, maybe I will unfairly blame Thomas Block for this. Why everyone on the plane had to turn into blood thirsty zombies and rapists is beyond me. The plot had so much potential to make a great tale of adventure and survival.When you compare it to great story's like By The Rivers Of Babylon, or Cathedral it dose not make the grade at all."
5,300 Babies...Great Baby How-To Book!,You too can get to sleep at night! This is the theme of this book...order in your life and in your baby's life from the very beginning! Worked great for both of our kids now well adjusted adults. I offer it to every pregnant person I hear about!
1,Very Dated- really a manual of what not to do,"This is essentially a Cry-It-Out philosophy, which has been proven to be harmful and does register in ""implicit memory"" Of course everyone wants their baby to sleep through, but not this way!"
5,Great Service!,love this book and seller was great too! thanks for getting it to me in a timely manner with no issues.
3,okay experience,I received the book well within the shipping promise time. The book was a little older and more worn than I thought was stated but in okay condition. The cost of shipping was very high considering my location.The book itself is amazingly helpful.
1,Horrifying!,"This book goes against all standard medical advice. According to the AAP, a baby should be fed when hungry - not according to the clock. Moms who have used a strict feeding schedule have had babies suffering from Failure to Thrive, and have lost their milk supply and been unable to continue nursing.In addition to the hopelessly outdated feeding advice, the book contains dangerous advice about the use of talcum powder and tummy sleeping.Do yourself and your baby a favor and run this book past your pediatrician first. Then throw it in the garbage."
4,Good read!,"I read this book awhile ago and really liked the schedule advice in this book. While some of the information is outdated (such as tummy sleeping, giving juice in a bottle, etc.), the concept of putting a child on a schedule is definitely much needed advice. I also like how she outlined a practical daily schedule for multiple siblings, etc. This is a great ""how to book"" as long as it is used with a good dose of common sense."
2,best and not so best poetry,"If you like Robert Bly, then you won't mind that he has chosen poems much like his style. If prose poems drive you to commit violent acts, then you should avoid most of this book. There is a variety of poems in quality, varying from trite, to excellent. It is a good starting place if you want to find new poets to read, but the poems represented may not be their best poetry."
3,"""safe""","I always enjoy reading volumes in this series. I even enjoyed reading Bloom's anthology, though I am fiery trajectory away from his strange reactionary stancecademic approach...THIS volume, is subtle, a pleasant read...but alas, ""safe."" With some notable exceptions which I will not explicitly note here...the poems are warm milk before bed time, with a slightly pleasing taste of the fragrance of grass of this particular field, that particular pasture.Safe is nice...and of course has a certain beauty.... With an anthology like those in this series however, I'd like a few showers of fish and frogs on my Spring morning walk...a few beautifully sharp briars scratching my shins..."
5,A book worth buying,"I really enjoyed Robert Bly's introduction about 'the heat'. All genuine artists are aware of 'the heat' in some way or the other; Heat is what was to Ezra Pound his definition of 'image'. We can even trace 'the heat' back to the idea of catharsis in Aristotle's Poetics. The moments of knowing, human growth, liberation from certain limits are essential aspect of human being that is universal, and it is not confined by any gender or racial limits. This is particularly important because it removes oneself from the influence of multiculturalism and feminism which we hear so often. The anthology itself presents us with finest examples of 'the heat' by contemporary poets. Many thanks to Peggy Steele, Revan Schendler, Robert Creeley, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and everyone else in the anthology for their excellent works. It is nice to know that I can still find good poetry, even though it may be few."
5,Refreshingly accessible,"I look forward to each new installment of the BAP series, and I appreciate the unique gloss that each guest editor puts on ""their"" edition. I enjoy some volumes more than others, and Bly's is one of my favorites. I wearied of the political stridency in Adrienne Rich's 1996 volume, and John Hollander's 1998 volume was a bit too formalistic. Bly's volume, though, contains a nice selection of accessible, incisive and sparkling poems--crisp, pungent and immediate."
3,"Great start, then downhill","I was excited by the first few poems in this collection because I admire formalism and precision in poetry. But I also admire life, surprise, human voices, and raw power in poetry, and the more I read of this collection, the more I felt the need to open a window for some air. Too many of these poems were left-brain exercises in language, but language as divorced from life. And the lengths! There wasn't a single long poem in this collection that I had any interest in continuing with after the first three pages, and to my dismay, many of these went on considerably beyond three pages. (One was at least 30 pages, or was I hallucinating?)"
2,Robert Bly's particularly histrionic take on modern poetry,"The low-caliber high-octane unrestrained emotion-spewing in this volume will make you wish Harold Bloom or Louise Gluck had come back for another round instead.(Why are all the other reviews of this book referring to the utterly different 1998 collection? Despite what Amazon thinks, there's absolutely no shared material here.)"
3,Not bad for the price,"I've had my YO-520 for a year now and find it is pretty adequate for basic functions. My biggest problem is I used to have an OZ model that came with DayTimer software, a larger display, and was a whole lot easier to use. Then again, it cost 6 times as much! The YO-520 is fairly simple to use, but lacks the ability to categorize expenses and memos, a feature I sorely miss. It's also difficult to add new schedule entries when there's already an entry for the same date. You have to scroll to a clear date, enter the information and change the date. Also, the MyWizard website has hardly anything useful to download for the YO-520. The OZ models had a button for new entries and was much easier. Still, for the price you get a lot of functionality, and the batteries last a good long time."
1,A candle that burned bright but quickly faded.,"For the first year that I used my YO-520 I was very pleased. It had lots of room for telephone entries and added information, excellent backlight, useful scheduling feature, easy accessibility to features.Unfortunately after the first year and a month, it went ""bellyup,"" losing all data. All I get now is a message reading ""Data has been impaired! Press(Y) to CLEAR ALL memory."" Sharp service was less than useful."
1,Sharp YO-520P Memo Master,"I purchashed this product in the spring of 2010. The product starting losing pixels with each week of use. It is now 4 months later and the product is essentially useless because there are so many pixels missing I cannot read anything that I programmed into it.When I contacted the seller about this problem after 2 months of use I was told that I was trying to scam her. I am the one who has been scammed, as I purchased a defective product that is now unusable."
1,Length of Service just over the warranty period,It only lasted 8 months and I have now had to purchase a second one. I'm out $125 for very little service.
3,Major problem with Sharp YO-520 Memo Master,"I purchased this beautiful Memo Master as a backup for the one I have now. Imagine my dismay when I tried to transfer the data on my computer to the Memo Master. I connected the standard 9-pin cable to my COM port 1 and the other end of the cable to the computer link of the organizer. I then turned on the organizer, pressed the PCSYNC button and using the Sharp YO-520 software tried to do a full transfer from my computer to the organizer only to get a message telling me that a connection could not be established!!! I tried several times to no avail. I know the connection works because I use it with my other MEMO MASTER. Apparantly the problem is with the MEMO MASTER I just purchased. I am very upset."
4,Sharp YO-520P Organizer,"I had one of the organizers before and mine went dead, so I was looking for another one, but found out that they did not make them anymore. I was glad to find one on Amazon.com, but I found that the price was a little steep, but I wanted it anyway, since all my addresses and family information was on it. I remember only paying around $100.00 and here I had to pay $255.00 plus shipping. My son always tell methat I am living in the past.BL"
1,Sharp Yo-520,It was great until I got Windows-XP. Now it doesn't work and I lost the Software CD and I now I have all my important addresses just in limbo on this organizer. If it breaks or I loose it... I loose everything! Help?
5,Wonderful,The pictures in this book are of very cute yet lifelike clay figures. I love it because it presents a wheelchair as a very ordinary way to get around. It doesn't seem forced or gratuitous.
5,Mind Over Matter,"An overall excellent text on the psychology of bodybuilding for those lifting weights at any level from novice to competitor. The book will help you synchronize mind and body and achieve significant, consistent and more effective training results. The chapters are clear and concise and include self-assessments and applications to practice and which facilitate learning the concepts and using them during your workout routine.Excellent chapters on concentration, relaxation, motivation and visualizations and for the hard core lifters, a chapter on psychological aspects and factors of competing."
1,Sound quality issues!,"Warning: This release has major sound quality issues. I'm quite surprised that the 5 star reviewer did not mention this. The clips on the product page accurately reflect the sound quality of the recording. I naively thought that the problem existed only on the clips, considering the review. The piano is distorted to the point of being almost unlistenable. This is too bad, as the playing of Evans and Gomez is truly inspired here."
2,Volume control does not work,I know this is an inexpensive set of speakers but the volume control on the front simply does not work. Receive the wrong color too.
2,Doesn't Dim,"I got these and put them in a dimmable chandelier. Then I used the dimmer switch, and it turns out they're either on or off. Back to incandescent bulbs, I guess. At least the price wasn't too bad."
4,an almost unique resource,"This is one of a very few treatments out there on Gujarati, which is a beautiful language related to (but quite different from) better known languages in the neighborhood such as Hindi and Panjabi. The book begins with an excellent treatment of the Gujarati writing system and pronunciation and moves on very quickly from beginning dialogues to more sophisticated (and livelier)material and the grammatical exposition was very clear. There are, unfortunately, a lot of typos, in both the Gujarati script and also in the transliterations (which are mostly phased out by the middle of the book). When I bought the book cassettes were available as well, and the recordings were of an excellent quality. It is hard to understand why the book would have gone out of print- one can certainly hope that a new and intensively proofread edition will be published."
1,Awful!,"As a Tibetan Buddhist and a lover of mysteries, I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have forced myself to read. There are a multitude of mistakes about Buddhist thought and especially Tibetan Buddhism. I would hate to think that anyone who read this would think they knew something about Tibetan Buddhism from this book!The characters are wooden, the plot convoluted and confusing, the pace painfully slow. Avoid this book at all costs!"
1,A must not read,"A must read?!?! I think not!! I gave up after just twelve pages. Yes, it was THAT DULL."
5,A must-read for Hillerman Fans,"When I read the Booklist review a couple months ago, I knew this had the potential to be one of the more interesting books to be published this Summer. This book does for Buddhism and Tibetan culture what Tony Hillerman's books have done for Navajo and Hopi culture and mythology. I learned a tremendous amount while being intrigued and entertained. The plot is believable, the characters are quite real and the ending not easily determined in advance. Make no mistake, this isn't an easy read and you need to concentrate quite a lot at times to comprehend which characters are which, but it's well worth slogging through those points. Low violence, low profanity, very low sex and a cast of characters you really get involved with sums up this book. I don't know how Mr. Pattison could pull off a sequel, but he should definitely write more fiction."
4,The Skull Mantra by Elliot pattison,"I thought this was a great read, full of twists and surprises. His rendering of the Tibetan landscape was vivid and made for a fun read. I also appreciate his description of all the grey areas between the occupying army, the Tibetans and the outside world.Although I am always appreciative of artistic license I was a little shocked at his complete misrepresentation of Buddhism. The Karma Kagyu school is the branch of Vajrayana Buddhism one would find among the Khampas of the East. I can tell you that it contains no dualistic views as are portrayed in the book. No gods, inner or outer, no soul, no demons, no seperation, no concept of sin. There is no need for faith if the ultimate nature of reality can be directly experienced and understood as non dualistic in its totality. The religion portrayed is sort of a mystical Christianity with a Tibetan face. I just hope readersdon't think this is what Buddhism is.The current head of the Kagyus is the 17th Karmapa."
5,Excellent,This package came carefully packed and within the time frame told.The book is in excellent shape. Thank you for your promptness
3,Amazing exposure to Tibet and its Culture,"I really found this book a chore to read. I read it at bedtime and it served its purpose as it put me to sleep every time. The description of the prison atrocities, the Tibetan culture and religion were all very interesting but I felt the story line disappeared in the complicated discussions of history and folkways. Was interesting enough to hang in to the end but wouldn't chose another by the same author."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"What a disappointment this novel was! It had absolutely no flow. It jerked from one segment to another, and the author seemed not to be able to tie these segments together smoothly. I was glad that I had already read quite a bit of nonfiction about Tibet because this story certainly didn't make clear exactly what is going on there."
2,"ho-hum, but cool cultural stuff","yeah, can't believe this won an Edgar. Must have been the ""Free Tibet"" vote on the committee. The book is good, not great, but good. The Tibet info is a lot of fun and very interesting, but the plot is somewhat bleh and the book drags. It really never grabs the reader. Not sure why so many have gushed about it, but it really is a middling plot, too many coincidences and somewhat unbelievable. Shan, the main character, is as bland as can be as well."
3,Not For Everyone,"This book represents the first entry by the writer into the world of Fiction. He has written previous books about China and is well versed in this area. The difficulty that this reader found was that it read more about the Chinese way of doing thigs as well as severe oppression of the monks in Tibet. The mystery is couched against this backdrop in a work that is extaordinarily well written. The book is rather tedious for the initial three hundred pages. After that, it takes hold and is difficult to put down as there are many twists and unexpected turns. The writer is so enamoured with Chinese History that the Story appears to suffer, The characters are numerous and, with similar names, are frequently hard to keep track of. As with many writers, the characters are sorely in need of depth. They do not have the depth that one would expect. This is an interesting and, if one is a patient reader, a book that is of interest on various levels."
4,Great Journey for the Reader and the Characters,"I was wandering around a secondhand bookstore struggling to find something interesting to read. Somehow I just picked up the Skull Mantra and as sometimes happens a random book can be a treat. And this certainly was. The thing that sticks in my mind was the chance to be taken on a journey somewhere completely new and unfamiliar to me.I found this story to be a great education and also very entertaining. Tibet, Buddhism and the Chinese regime are indeed interesting subjects and all invoking different and personal emotions. The characters seemed so real and although a few times I did get a little lost (probably my fault, not the authors) it all came together and I was not quite ready for it to end. I am off now to get the next book..."
5,Entertained and Educated,"Skull Mantra by Eliot Pattison is a clever, intricate mystery. Thoroughly enjoyable, this offering has so much more substance than the sometimes pulpy, obvious mystery genre. I learned so much at the same time and found myself researching factoids about Tibet just to satisfy my own curiosity. With the fascinating and believable character of Shan, this is a movie waiting to happen. Someone call Richard Gere..."
4,A rollicking good read,"Spanning several continents and three quarters of a century (including two world wars, McCarthyism etc), this is a fast-moving tale about a film director obsessed by Rousseau's The Confessions and aiming to make an epic film of the story. The structure of the book is essentially chronological first person narrative, written in the form of an autobiography. However the recounting of the past is interspersed with some short present-time frames from 1972, when the protagonist is hiding on an island. His 1972 story is moving forward very slowly while the main story gallops through the decades, ultimately converging to the present (1972) in a deliciously ambiguous ending on a beach. While I loved the book as a rollicking good read, I didn't feel it was one of Boyd's best. Vacillated between 3 and 4 stars"
5,Definitely destined to be a classic!,"For the life of me, I will never ever forget the first and last sentences of this book, the slightly-damaged hardbound edition of which I bought for only a dollar(!) in a discount section of a bookstore here in Manila in 1994! A rare, serendipitous literary find for me, indeed. Truly captivating, a biography like this of one John James Todd can only be created by one destined to be a world literary giant. Medicine, Mathematics, Philosophy, 20th Century History, Cinema -- all combined and meticulously woven in one great book of insights. It is as if every turn of a page of this book, a hologram appears and all you have to do is watch, laugh and weep as the 3-Dimensional events happen grandly, clearly, colorfully and ceaselessly before your very eyes."
2,a very different opinion,"I'm a great admirer of Willian Boyd, a person who has enjoyed his earlier novels. I was really looking forward to reading ""The New Confessions"". I started it and I persisted through the first 100 pages or so, but I couldn't finish it - a very rare way for me to treat a book. But the protagonist of ""Confessions"" is such a bitter misanthropic voice that the book was spoiled for me.I urge those who haven't yet read any Boyd to begin with one of his books of shorter fiction, or best of all, with ""Brazzaville Beach"", one of the best novels I've read in years. Then follow up with ""Restless"", another excellent and innovative book.Perhaps after those two, if you're as disenchanted with ""Confessions"" as I was, you'll still read Boyd's next work. Had this been my first exposure to him, it might have been my last."
4,Magnificent blend of classic literature history of film,"This novel is so bold. It's protagonist essays a contemprary film version of Rousseau's CONFESSIONS. The aspiration eats up his life, a lifetime which fits nicely into our century and the development of cinematic art. The reader travels through early century London and Gernmany and eventually to latter day Los Angeles. As soon as I finished this book I devoured the Rousseau and loved it as much."
2,The New Confessions is a Bore,"William Boyd went off the rails with this one. I found it tedious, ego-driven and unbelievable. I didn't care what happened to the characters and gave up in the middle.I enjoyed Boyd's other books. This one missed"
4,The new Confessionse n,"A bit long for me,but a good read. Enjoyed it very much. Will probably read more of this author. Looking forward to that."
3,Not bad,"This was purchased to be used as a privacy screen on our apartment balcony. It's not bad.I was hoping the bamboo would be thinner...like more of a screen. Instead, the individual bamboo sticks are each about the diameter of a pencil (or larger). It blocks out prying eyes in the daytime, but at night when our lights are on inside, it does squat.It withstands high winds and stays up pretty well with some secured zip-ties. When it's windy and rainy, it keeps out a lot of the rain and keeps the balcony fairly dry. A smoker's delight.When installing, I recommend gloves to prevent annoying splinters."
5,A little weathering made it perfect,I was at first put off buy the silver wire that weaves the bamboo together. The thickness of the bamboo was just right. After a short spell outdoors the wire weathered nicely and I'm quite happy with this. It was sturdier than I thought it would be and held it's shape very well. I'll probably order more.
4,great for hiding neighbors ugly yeard,great natural looking border . hides the neighbors ugly yard without having to put up a privacy fence which is just a big wall.
2,Would not buy from this vender again.,Thease bars were heat damaged. I would have sent them back but did not open right away. I just tossed them. Have not had good luck buying candy on line. I will get from BJs or costco next time.
1,Where's the chocolate?,There should be a law against labeling such filler-laden crud as chocolate. There is barely any chocolate taste and the number of almonds has dropped drastically. Avoid it.
1,Drawstring tears from bag - useless,"Bag doesn't tear. But, drawstring makes it usuable. The drawstring tears out of the slot that makes it work. So when you have to tie it, you essentially have to make an overhand know. You might was well go back to twist ties.I wasted $30 on these bags!!!!Thomas"
1,Bogus bags,"Rarely in life do we have such easy choices - if you're looking for tall kitchen bags that won't break, go for the Hefty and not for the Glad. (That's the same conclusion Consumer Reports came to in their March 2010 issue.) I bought two boxes of the heavy duty Hefty bags and they never broke. Then (by mistake) I bought a box of the Glad bags, since the package looked similar to the Hefty bags. EVERY SINGLE BAG BROKE - either the sides ripped when I was stretching it over the wastebasket or the straps broke when I pulled it out again and tried tying it up to put in the trash. I was almost to the point of writing a nasty note to the manufacturer complaining that their quality has gone shockingly downhill when I noticed these were made by Glad, not Hefty. If these bags were cars, they'd all be recalled!"
5,Biotech promises: a better world only for the rich?,"Will biotechnological advances really create a better world free of hunger and medical troubles, or will it result in benefits to only users who can afford it - and will these benefits hold a dangerous impact for religion or society? Such is the discussion explored in essays in BIOTECHNOLOGY UNGLUED: SCIENCE, SOCIETY & SOCIAL COHESION. From applications and issues in agriculture and medicine to social issues, biotechology's promises and dangers alike are surveyed in scholarly discussions."
4,"A Labor of Love, Worthwhile to all students of American History","Definately the untold story of slavery in America and the Western World. Olexer gives us the history, peppered liberally with text from original documents, showing that our roots of slavery are much deeper than we are commonly taught.The writing is easy to read, but painful to acknowledge. While Olexer gives us an unvarnished piece of our history, she never devolves into sermonizing or shaming the reader. We are left to make our own conclusions and search our own souls, which is always far more disturbing."
5,The Enslavement of the American Indian in Colonial Times,"Barbara Olexer has done an excellent job of describing the enslavement of the American Indian during colonial times. If you want to know how the American Indian was totally taken advantage of, then this is the book for you. Our forefathers did an extreme injustice to the Indians that were living here before the settlers ever landed in America. I think this is a must reading for every American. We stole all the lands from American Indian, and we continue to this day to take advantage of the native Americans. Great job Barbara.Michael Monji, author of ""Does It Pay To Die?"""
2,I CAN'T SEE...,"I can't see how a book with only 96 pages can cover all the aspects of the career of such a great, good and famous band as Bon Jovi, with already almost twenty years on the road. TO to that, it is necessary a book like Mick Wall wrote about Iron Maiden, called ""RUN TO THE HILLS"", with almost 300 pages filled with text (not photos)."
1,Tired,Watched this with my kids who utterly and totally rejected it. The stories seemed far too didactic.
3,"As mentioned, it is abridged and not live","Perhaps, and indeed probably, I am greatly spoiled by Keillor's stories. As a result, I don't like changes, such as the lack of a live audience which I think Keillor feeds off of. However, it must be said that there are stories here that only Garrison Keillor could possibly come up with and that is by no means nothing."
5,cd,My wife loves his stories so now she has this 3 cd set to add to her collection. should be entertaining.
2,Garrison Keillor Stories,"I was very disappointed with Garrison Keillor Stories, having purchased, played and loved the humour in Tales from Lake Woebegone I thought this was a collection Garrison must have cobbled together under duress."
3,A Different Voice -,"I bought this collection of stories to listen to for our most recent tag-team road trip to Seattle. We enjoy Prairie Home Companion and thought we'd enjoy these too. Based on the reviews I read of the product before buying this collection, I looked forward to hearing these stories. We are still fans, but not of these stories."
3,we found this series to be slightly boring,We were expecting a more humours collection of stories in the usual Garrison Keillor style. I would not recommend this collection.
3,Just Okay,I know Keillor has a lot of fans. That's why I chose this book sight unseen. The stories are good but I didn't like the reader's voice. Very important to me.
5,This is the second time I bought this product,"I had received this collection about 10 years ago as a present. I lost it. I like the ""Babe"" story the best. I bought it just to listen to that again. I think the author is amazing. I like to listen to his stories while riding on long trips. His voice is so soothing. His stories take me to a fun place and I can visualize the characters so well."
2,Old-school Care Bears,Our kids are fans of the new Care Bears. This set is of the original Care Bears from the 80's?Our kids won't watch this. Thus it was worthless to us.
5,Circa 1985,"Wanted to introduce my daughter to the care bears I grew up with. She loves them (she's only three but loves care bears). They are definitely dated though - you will laugh at a few things like the clothes and the hairstyles, but the old lessons are timeless."
5,Looks great at a great price,I ordered these and received them in just a few short days. They look very real and the price was amazing. Everywhere else we looked they cost over $100 each.
5,Not bad for going out on his own.,I thought he did really well on this CD considering he didn't have either of his brothers with him when he made this one. I thought it was really good. If I had to do it over I would still buy it again.
5,FBI Pocket Manual,Every FBI agent should carry a copy of this little book as a reminder of what the Law (U.S.Code) says about various crimes associated with 9-11.
4,ALL TARGETS AQUIRED!FIRE!,"FOR SOME STUPID REASON PEOPLE CALL THESE THE CHAOS/GAMMA/TIKAL EPISODES.IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CALL IT WHAT IT'S REALLY CALLED,(SONIC ADVENTRE EPISODES.)DON'T CALL IT ANYTHING AT ALL!ANYWAY,THESE EPISODES ARE GREAT!THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE THIS TIME IS THAT WHEN THE SCREEN IS FOCUSED ON SONIC,HE LOOKS SHINY AND WEIRD AND ALL.IT JUST BUGS ME.THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WHEN THESE EPISODES WERE ON CHANNEL 5 THOUGH.SO THAT'S WHY I TOOK THE FIFTH STAR AWAY.(MUST HAVE FOR ALL SONIC FANS!)"
4,Over and over again listening,"This album mixes moving, artful, bare-bones recordings with drops of atmospheric old found-audio. The music is beautiful, and Amy Annelle's songwriting and voice are perfect.The only down side to this album are some of the found-audio clips. Some of it is dead-on -- gospel and twangy bluegrass that crackles into and under the new material, giving depth and contrast.Some of it, however, is smarmy Southern Christian radio preachers talking to vaguely impaired elderly men. I can't tell if this material is earnest or ironic, but it sure sets a mood and makes me think. On further listens to the album, it troubles me less and less.I found this album on emusic.com, and have listened to it so much that I then went and bought it from the Hush Records web site so I can have an original copy to play in the truck, and to read the liner notes for more insight.If you're a fan of minimal bluegrassy recordings and artists like Gillian Welch or old Patsy Cline, pick this up."
1,Silent? Yeah right....,"I bought this ""Silent"" wheel to go along with my SAM Princess Hamster Cage that I already have. It came with a wheel that was great but too noisy for my nocturnal hamster. Both the description on the item and the description on the box said the wheel was going to be silent, specifically, ""Silent spinner designed for nocturnal hamsters. It lets you sleep while they play."" I was very excited about that. My hamster (who is of normal size and weight) was also excited about it, as he ran in it for most of the night last night. But alas, the wheel is just as loud as the one that came with the cage. I mean, I expected a little bit of noise realistically but to have spent the money and not gotten a difference is a rip off. It advertises silent, I wanted it to at least be quieter but it is not.Other than that, it's a good quality wheel. But the description is not accurate, so beware if that's why you are buying the product."
5,Possibly the best Isaiah commentary out there,"While still in seminary I had recourse to over fifteen commentaries on Isaiah. Motyer is a fine commentary on Isaiah, but Childs's insights are superb. I recommend both for anyone serious about Isaiah."
1,not worth a ****,"The book imo is infiltrated with some nasty new age thoughts. For example does not even understand the importance or rendering the Hebrew word helel, which should be translated Lucifer in Isaiah 14:12. The change in new versions of the bible does not spring from the Hebrew language but, from the new age 'theology' of editors like this guy. Imo the book is just another link in the chain to massive misunderstanding. The whole point of 14 was to describe Lucifer's descent to hell. And, he missed the boat. I returned the book.itisamystery"
4,Only for those who didn't buy the Harveytoons DVD set.,"Some of the Casper Cartoons from the Harveytoons DVD set have been collected here for parents who don't want to expose their kids to the violent Herman & Katnip cartoons. Casper is a wholesome & lovable dead boy looking for a friend, kind of an innocent Poltergeist.Best of Casper, Vol. 1 Includes""True Boo,""""Boo Ribbon Winner,""""Good Scream Fun,""""Fright from Wrong,""""Zero the Hero,""""Ground Hog Play,""""Boo Hoo Baby,""""Spooking About Africa,""""Puss 'N Boots,""""Hide and Shriek,""""Red, White, And Boo,""""Pig-a-Boo.""The original theatrical titles have been trimmed down to just the cartoon title."
4,"Best of Casper, Vol 1",great for little ones 2-4 yrs old!!!! Made a long time ago-not so scarey as other movies.
1,These DVDs are not what they promised....,"When I received my box set, I found out that the ""printable materials for educators"" was not really available. I was very disappointed since this is why I purchased them in the first place."
3,Good but not the best Endgame Book,For a single book that tries to cover the endgame this does a ok job. I am a good player for my age. and I feel that studing endgames is very important. The book builds on lessons which is good. The book does not cover some very important endgames that I have seen and therefor it leaves out important stuff.I like the endgame book called BASIC CHESS ENDINGS much better because it covers a lot more.
1,So low budget the fire was computer generated....,"I have no idea what this movie was about. None whatsoever. So low budget that they couldn't even afford fire (actual fire!) in most of the scenes. As for the actors, they all had heavy Scottish accents. I guess they were supposed to be the descendants of that hot head Scottie."
1,Rubbish!!!,"One of the worst movies I've seen. It's just laughable, from the acting, to the location somewhere on a beach in Scotland to the production design (come on are we supposed to believe that people 100's of years in the future are using Army surplus tents from WWII). Don't waste your time......."
1,don't waste your money,no real plot....the storyline does not make any sense. and what a terrible ending. i guess the flick had to end somehow. the computer generated explosions were cartoonist. this was a bad film.
4,"It gets major points for creativity, indie low-budget film","Despite the bad reviews, I just had to see this film after I learned it had a $13,000 budget.It wasn't great, but then again, it was better than a LOT of big budged Hollywood movies I've seen this year. In terms of entertaining me, it did slightly better even than Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, and even better than the most recent Narnia Installment, Prince Caspian.It had major problems, some acting errors, disjointed plot. But the special effects weren't bad for an indie sci-fi, and was a creative premise (much like Pitch Black).Again, not great - but I would much rather small films like this get attention, and the directing/writing skills of new indie artists get developed, than continue to see the same old hundred-million-dollor formula films get recycled by Hollywood year after year.I give it 3.5 stars."
1,AWFUL,I have never written for a review but I felt obligated to say that this is the worst movie ever. I would rather watch Glitter or a public access channel movie. I can't believe this found a way to my DVD player. Just terrible.
1,What?,"What happened again? Who were these people, and what were they doing out there in the middle of the desert? They may've lost their lives, but I lost $1.05 for the rental. Really spiffy tactical energy-sphere caulking guns, though."
1,Bad - Bad - Bad Piece of Junk,"The first one got so that it vibrated and shook in less than 3 months. The replacement took to vibrating to the point of discomfort in 6 months. Also, husband went through the screens in about 2 months each; they had to be replaced for the razor to be safe and the screens are not cheap. It's just a bad design."
2,Modest watch,"It's worth the money which isn't saying much. The watch seems to keep good time -- that's good. It's a watch, after all. It looks sort of good in a slightly cheap fake gold sort of way. What more is there to say? I'd get a cheap Timex or Casio before I'd get another of these, but for the money if the look appeals to you, buy it . . ."
5,awesome,"simply put: the best album ever. not one song i don't love. better than ""all eyez on me"", better than anything biggie ever put out, the best album i've ever heard. i am shocked more people don't feel this way, and that he didn't catch on. TQ put out the best album ever here."
5,TQ straight out snapped!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the mutha...cd. I remember buyin it when i was younger and playin it out. I would still do the same, this is not your average same ol same ol cd. This is true talent from the vocals down to the lyrics. My favorite tracks are 3,8,12,13(my favorite of all),17, and 18"
5,Great R N' B from Terrance Quaites,"TQ is so talented.He can write the sort of lyrics you'd hear on a hip-hop album and sing it all.He has one of the best voices I've ever heard.'Westside' is the best song on here,and probably the best TQ will ever do.They're all good,but 'Westside' just stands out more than the others.TQ is a real talented person,he doesn't just talk about how many ... he fancies,'When I Get Out' is the only song he does that on.I'm going to TQ's concert when he comes to do gigs in Britain."
5,The greatest album ever,"TQ is a great artist and should get the recognition he deserves. Every song on this album is great and their is nothing about this album i do not like, it's excellently written and sung some of the great songs on this album includes the greatest single ever ""Westside"" another great song ""Better Days"" and ""Bye Bye Baby"" also great songs unreleased such as ""The Comeback"", ""If The World Was Mine"" and another great song ""Paradise"" i love this album it's my favourite album by far i also enjoy his second album ""The Second Coming"" but it is nothing compared to this album i listen to it wherever i go and when i go to bed so if you enjoy well made music you should buy this album as it is the best album i have ever heard and their is no song on it i don't like and TQ's the greatest singer and song writter ever and i cant wait for the next album from the great TQ."
5,pucker bloke,"this is the best cd your ever going to get he's better than 2pac. bests songs like westside they never saw me coming, better days, bye bye baby, your sister and its just brillent and want to get a cd get this one.david channing"
5,TQ is the greatest,"This cd is great. I love the song ""Bye, Bye Baby"". I listen to this cd about 5 times a day over and over. It's a really really good cd!!"
2,"Quite nice, a bit too smooth!","T. Quaintes is one of the best R&B artists at the moment.But in comparision to Dru Hill it's not so spectacular! Good work for the age of 18. Songs are too 'romantic` , you don't recognise that a new song begins if you listen to this CD.He's got a real cute smile and is very good looking but girls shouldn't mark his music after the looking. I wanna visit LA this summer perhaps someone has time and interrest to show me this town."
3,aaayh,an over priced item ment to apeal to those who apprieate price above all else. I put it on my bucket list but it just isnt all that
5,Best Cherries ever!,"These cherries are perfect for just about anything you need them for. My Manhattans are more superb, and vanilla ice cream with these sprinkled on top with some cherry juice is to die for. Great shipping, quick delivery, and they are better than advertised. Still looking for more ways to use them... delicious!"
5,This book is an excellent tool to use to advance your career,"This book is excellent! It has really showed me how to make my resume more marketable, and prepare me for a better career. I have passed this book on to my family, and co-workers."
2,a tribal assault with a touch of hardhouse,"Don't expect vocal anthems here. this is all beats and sounds, with an occasional vocal thrown in. This is actually more interesting tribal, slightly aggressive, more appealing than some of the real repetitive stuff, but it's still not my thing--the remix of Marc et Claude's Lovin You isn't so bad. Good number of long versions, though. Track times:1. jiu-jitsu-emotional (7:37)2. memories of ocean drive (6:34)3. superconscious (7:03)4. skindeep (6:17)5. alma (6:52)6. get my love (8:53)7. echoes (8:44)8. first tribal feeling (5:16)9. chemical attraction (5:14)10. loving you (5:56)"
3,Cute but too slippery,"I purchased this item for my daughter when she was 18months, she loved the water coming out of the holes but when she tried to walk around she slipped all over the place. The slide isn't stable and moves easily. You have to constantly run the water thru it so it wastes a lot of water. It is easy to assemble but she only played with it twice."
3,Fun for a couple of uses at most,"We purchased this pool for our daughter's first birthday party with the intention of many children being able to play in it at once. It is a cute novelty for a party.The drawbacks? A hose had to constantly be on to keep the fountians going (water directly from the hose is cold even on a hot day in July) and the slide did move around so it did not get used.The clean up was difficult. The pool needed to drain and then dry out in order to put it away. By the time the pool was dry a day or two later, it was too dirty to put away. 8 months later it is still draped across a chaise in my backyard.What we like: It was super cute and a hit at the party. The accessories were fun and we brought them indoors for my daughter to play with, she still plays with the starfish shaped rings. This summer we will rinse the pool off and if it is not damaged we will try to use it again."
2,Fun but.....,"I got this for my daughter when she was one. She loved playing in it. The slide is worthless and I through it away right off the bat. I would let her use her plastic slide instead. It is much smaller then the picture seem to lead you to believe, and it was trashed by the end of the summer. I would guess that it was used atleast 15 times (but not moved much). I would say that it is worth the money for a one year old or under, but not any older."
3,nice first pool.,"It is a nice first pool.....especially if you have a portable air pump.The slide thing is sort of pointless. My kids, ages 1-3, just stood around on it. They liked it, though. Played and laughed. After the third use it was broken."
1,Poor Construction!,"I got this on sale @ target for $8. And that is how much it was worth. The kids had a great time for about an hour before the seam started to rip open. No amount of patch has worked b/c it is right on the the seam, and not a flat surface. So that was a bummer."
4,A great album but...,"I have to agree with previous reviewers, while ""My Beautiful"" is an amazing song, I kinda wish Lennon would stop remaking it. I have literally 4 versions of it now. The one on this cd renamed ""Where Do I fit In?"", a live accoustic I found on the internet (really pretty if you can find it), a duet with Travis Meeks off of her import ""I Am"", and the original on ""5:30 am"". I think I'm in the minority though; I prefer the ""I Am"" version, the addition of a male counterpart does add to it in my opinion and the guitar sounds better. Also, there is a different version of ""No One Knows"" on ""I Am"" that in my opinion, is much better. I love that song and I believe the reworked version on this album is missing something.All that aside, I think it is a great album and I hope Lennon has more to come. If only she'd do a show near me so I could see her live."
2,don't buy this dvd,"it apears adv has dropped the ball way down the stairs on this re-release. Wrath Of Daimajin is remastered, but cropped into a 1.85:1 ratio. but who the hell would re-release a film, remaster it and then crop it? I don't get adv sometimes. they're very strange 40- year old anime fans who would just release non-anamorphic movies with pale transfers and have non-removable subtitles for a japanese 2.0 track and lousy promo trailers for extras instead of putting time in their dvds. I'm sure most people would rather get the non-anamorphic one released long ago. the extras are pretty bad too, a little 22 second promo for all three Daimajins that was on the dvds before and some other adv-made trailers that you won't watch anyway."
2,It's Your Last Chance!,This is an awesome film with beautiful special effects! That said there is a better version of this film which is sadly out of print! If you don;t believe me about the quality then just read the other who have reviewed this product. To make matters worse this company has recently folded so if you want to own this film then you better pick up any copy you can get your hands on. Be wary of people who like to take advantage of these types of situations because they will overcharge you. Anyway good hunting to you steadfast collector of fun Japanese films!
1,NOT in ENGLISH!!,"WARNING: Not In English as stated in the description. Only English sub-titles. Not worth one penny to me, i hate reading sub-titles because you can not enjoy or concentrate on the movie. Schroeder (DJ WACK ""O"") of Cult Movies Magazine."
2,"Fragile, breaks easily","Father bought me this aircraft. The first time I used it, I hand launched it. It flew about 30 feet into the air, then the gears in the engine snapped apart and the plane nose dived into a pond. After sending it back to the company and 8 weeks later (which made it winter) I received it back and the gears were still broken. Never buy an electric again. Gas engines work better."
4,A constructive criticism of Hip Hop,"The Haunting of Hip Hop bye Berice Berry was a very insightful outlook on modern day pop culture. By creating the character of Freedom, a rapper who wanted to use his music constructively but needed to produce what was popular first, is a very common theme. The uniqueness of the novel was that every other chapter refered back to the older times of slavery when the drum, and the beat of music was used to bring different captives together by using a universal language. By connecting the two storylines realistically, and making Freedom realize the true effects of his music. Bertice Berry brought up a very interesting view on the negativity produced from rap and the affects on todays youth. The Haunting of Hip Hop was a very interesting and entertaining novel."
4,Rhythmically Poetic Novel,"This book has a rhythm and flow to it, just as the whole culture of Hip Hop. Although the story is in many ways far-fetched, the textures and images Bertice weaves into the story are rich and imaginative. The flow begins with a compelling drama around the main character, Hip Hop Producer Freedom, whose lifework has been dyed with the colors of his neighborhood and family experiences. The shocking twist in the middle of the tale rendered me speechless for a second. I distinctly remembered closing the book and my eyes for a moment to gather my thoughts before diving back in. The quest for answers and justice will keep readers riveted. Enjoy!"
4,Her work keeps getting better and better,"I read Redemption Song by Ms. Berry and thoroughly enjoyed it. I found myself, however, longing for more more more! More details, more filling out of the story. Yet, it still touched me deeply. In Hip Hop, I got more of the satisfaction that I craved. I liked the short chapters, because Ms. Berry gets to the point and gives you lots of cliffhangers. Ava kept me rolling. I loved Dora, have known people like Charles. Would have liked Freedom to be a little more fleshed out, but got the gist of him. Many excellent points made and I have shared the book with those I know who are involved with the hip-hop industry. I would have given 5 stars, but again, more details-how did the characters dress, more about how they look, what did their homes look like? I like to be able to ""see"" the whole story. Keep up the great work and thank you for speaking to a very much needed topic!"
2,some misinformation,"I can't speak to the entire volume (which is well produced, by the way), but when it comes to the mythology of the ancient near eastern world, he gets many, many things confused, mixing up parts of myths and giving wrong information."
3,picture book,this book is more amusing than accurate more of a picture book you'd read when you were little only with a twistgreat for novilty porpouses but thats about all
2,This one's for REAL HAPPYdancers...,"This is some real happy, body and soul type of vocal house. Not enough attitude or aggressiveness for my tastes. But If you're a fan of this style of house, here's a time listing:1. Just Be Yourself (5:08)2. I'll Take You There (6:42)3. Stop Playing with My Mind (6:04)4. That Sound (5:41)5. Time out For Love (5:26)6. Must be the Music (6:13)7. Make a Move on Me (6:35)8. Believe in Love (6:01)9. Take you to Love (6:22)10. Just me and You (5:22)11. Garden of love (5;17)"
5,"CBGB, Max's Kansas City,Hurrah,Danceteria",Great compilation of 1st & 2nd generation punk/new Wave/No Wave bands. Great tunes!! Neil Cooper-re-release this CD!!! And pay us our royuaalties!!! Fin Hunt-ex-Invader.
3,Pearls and swine,"Ruby is a pearl jewelry designer and Zane is a businessman. They are forced to work together when they each inherit half of a prosperous pearl jewelry business in Broome, Australia. Zane is NOT a nice hero. He is extremely nasty to Ruby, and you really have to wonder why Ruby falls for him. He treats her terribly, believing her to be his deceased father's mistress. This is not Trish Morey's best effort.Trish Morey previously wrote books on Ruby's sisters - Opal and Sapphire. Those books are ""The Italian's Virgin Bride"" and ""Stolen by the Sheik"" respectively. Both of these books are much better than this one. This book deserves two and a half stars. The tree stars are for completing the books on the sisters."
3,A fair stealth self-defense weapon that has limited use.,"I have always been in love with weapons of all kinds and I have spent a small fortune purchasing them. This particular little tool is made of hard plastic and is very light in weight. It has three fairly sharp sides and a point that can puncture easily. The grip is fairly good but I can see how it could slip in someone's hand who is not gripping it tightly. The top portion has a place to slip a cord or chain in order to carry it as a neck knife.In conclusion, I keep it on my desk and though I have carried it in the past, I prefer to carry knives, yawara sticks, canes and guns. I consider this a weapon to carry when you don't have access to more effective and efficient tools of self-defense.Rating 3 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Police Yawara Stick Techniques)."
4,I'm content with mine,"If you are expecting some Batman/Mission Impossible covert piece of bad-ass gadgetry, then stay away. If what you is a basic self-defense weapon that is very easy to hide in your clothes and almost idiot proof to use. Just remember; stab, don't slice. I did buy this with the neck sheath, but added a longer cord to it so that the thumb ring was just about my waistline and over my right hip."
5,Durable!,"Very durable! For the money, you just cant beat this. It is tough, and it is very sharp. You also dont have to worry if you go through the occasional metal detector if you cut the ring off."
3,Mediocre,"I purchased the Dart and shealth because I am a runner and have been chased by dogs more than my fair share of times. I figured the plastic would be light and more comfortable to carry than similar metal darts/spikes and would give me an edge aganist any dogs should I ever get bit. The knive is very thin and even using the reverse grip it would easily slip out. I eventually wrapped the handle with paracord as if it were a walking stick and the grip got infinitely better. The plastic is pretty cheap but could probably hold up for one good stab. This is no replacment for a real knife but given the low price and the way I use it, it is just fine."
2,not what I expected,"My son wanted this as a self defense item,not exactly what we expected.It is plastic(soft)can't be sharpened and easily nicked with slight pressure.At best it's a unique letter opener."
1,What a rip-off! Plastic Knifes!,"These throwing knives made by ""Cold Steel"" are made of plastic and are worthless. This has got to be the one of the biggest ripoffs on Amazon. I will never purchase anything from these people and I suggest you don't either. The expression ""Buyer Beware"" was created for people like this. Give me a break!"
5,For personal defense.,"For personal defense. Remove the steel loop. Then there's no detectable metal. Though ""plastic"", you can puncture the sidewall of a radial tire with enough force."
2,Unfortunately boring book on an interesting subject,"This is a tremendous subject for a book, but this is not the book. A better title for this book would be ""an administrative history of Anglo-American radio intercept units"". He goes into great detail about which services had authority over what (Navy, Army, etc.), but precious little about what these folks actually do.There must be many tremendously exciting stories about Allied and German radio intercept services, but this book is certainly not it."
3,Mobile Office,"This mobile office product works well for general organization while you're on the road. I was disappointed in how hard it is to move, and keep everything in tact. There is the straps/strings that hang off, and it doesn't zip closed. When not in use, it is very bulky and akward. I also found that the seller sent the product directly in the box, and my product was bent and damaged. I didn't bother to contact the seller about it, as the cost of returning it for another wasn't worth it to me. I thought is was an ok solution for the mobile office, just not user friendly to move around."
5,GREAT vegan entree,"I loved this noodle bowl! Easy to prepare, healthy, spice, and it smelled so good, I think my steak-eating boyfriend wanted to try a little."
3,Tony Joe better as a loner.,"A good CD, but not his best work. Tony Joe has such a unique style, and that sometimes makes his music difficult to blend with other artist. ""Did somebody make a fool out of you"" is one of my favorite Tony Joe songs, and is very well covered on this CD. Certainly good listening; a master stylist."
4,"Helps make vivid, lifelike eye popping prints",Great for pro as well as amateur photographers. I use Epson original on my Epson printer as it's only the way to go as off-brand causes maintenance problems (endless inkjet cleaning cycles) or ends up with an unsatisfying end result.
5,Captivating,"Survivors centers around my two favorite ST:TNG characters, namely Lt. Tasha Yar and Lt Cmrd. Data. It reveals intimate details of Tasha's past that were never allowed into the series due to her untimely demise at the hands of the creature Armus (she was killed because he was BORED?! How dumb is that?!). Her relationship with Dare, a man from her past, as well as her friend Data, the android, create an air of tension you normally wouldn't find in a story invovling Data pre-emotion chip. His constant thoughts about the event that 'never happened' and his jealousy (if it can be called such) directed at Dare and Tasha's rekindling relationship create a very 'humanizing' face for the seemingly emotionless android.This is a touching, emotional must-read for any Data or Tasha fans. Tasha/Data shippers unite!"
5,too ahead of their time,"I Dug 10 yrs back into my stacks, slipped good old LSD's Temporal in the laptop, put on the headphones, and blew the stitches out of my lobotomy. Ryan Lum and Suzanne Perry were making lush soundscapes that blended ethereal trip hop, shoegaze, and downtempo, a decade before those genres were even named. Temporal ranks with the best of those genres being produced today including the brilliant Blue Sky Black Death, Hungry Lucy, and Emancipator. As our kids discover these latter groups they may dig back into their parents stacks and realize we weren't as uncool as they thought. Sadly LSD languors in obscurity for sale at $3.00 here. If you don't have it and you like this genre you can't afford to pass it by. BUY !"
4,Did Leo buy a piano?,"Picture Leo Kottke putting together some lounge act, throwing down his guitar, and now playing piano.The Lyrics are just as quirky as Leo's.It just reminds me of Leo Kottke.I love Leo and I am starting to love this."
4,A great accessory,"I recently got a chance to take a look at these record sheets. They seemed VERY detailed and are just great. They are so easy to photocopy you will almost turn dizzy. The added bonus of the ship and droid record sheets are beautiful as well. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the character sheet is located in the Core Rule Book as well. The reason I didn't give it 3 stars is because it is MUCH easier to photocopy here. I can't believe how easy it was to find the character piloting skill attribute. That's what I ALWAYS look for first, and it takes me atleast 30 seconds. When I took a glance at these sheets it didn't even take me 10 seconds. The product is great, and if your not a photocopying person, just buy 2 of them. It's a great price and a great product!"
4,review,"the book is in good condition , it took a little longer than i expected but nothing more than the norm."
4,Great!,"I love especially ""la solitudine"" also the other songs are fantastic! And so romantic, love it! I love her so, so clear voice. Ciao!"
3,vieques,"This is a pictorial book about the island, Vieques which is part of Puerto Rico. The pictures are wonderful."
4,Touching and engaging,"""Dragons in the Waters"" is a good book. It has a mystery buried in it and you can easily start to like the characters. Madeleine has always been a very good writer and I appreciate her gift of comforting a person through her writing. ""Dragons in the Waters"" is about a young boy, Simon; a mysterious cousin; and an ancestor of Simon's that has a mystifying past. The book tells of Simon's adventures on a ship called the Orion, where he meets the O'Keefe family. At first things seem quite simple, but the plot quickly thickens and pulls you into the story. A good book to be read by young adults or to be read to younger children and many adults may like it, as well. If you like Madeleine's writing and her other books, I doubt you'll be disappointed with this story."
3,Not Among Her Best,"...disappointment with this book. I, too, came to this book with anticipation based on L'Engle's more well-known novels. It was a pleasant enough read but didn't engage me and left me thinking, ""That's it?"" If this was her only book, L'Engel would not be recognized as the masterful author her other books reveal her to be. Not a waste of time, but not the best read either."
3,No thanks.....,"I liked this book OK until I got to the last 10 pages. I am so not used to her writing books like this first off, but the fact that this ended so abruptly the way it did just left me feeling VERRRY empty. Now that I think about it, I think that book put me in a depressed state of mind. Darn Dragons in the Waters lol! I shall donate this to the used book store ASAP! Some of you may like this, but for me it was a no thanks!"
4,Escapist fun,"Wasn't L'Engle's husband a soap actor? This story rolled over the waves with action-reaction from start to finish. It was a fun read, with all the drama and half the romance of the soaps.L'Engle is always impressive with her eye for details and timeless relativity. You know that she's traveled on cargo ships and encountered South American policemen.It was strange to read this after also reading (ack! what was the title? an Austin story... the daughter travels to Antarctica). There were so many similarities. Did L'Engle plagiarize herself?"
2,very poor,"this album lacks any sort of musical depth and know how. there is a lot better experimental stuff out there by amon tobin, boards of canada, autechure, plastikman, richard james, among others. this is, quite simply, one of the worst buys i've had in some time. save your money."
5,"You just don't get it, do you....","Anyone who gives this CD a bad review obviously JUST DOESN'T GET IT and should stick to the Backstreet Boyz or something more cut and dry. This is a brilliant concept album that is highly entertaining, very cheery and fun. Arling and Cameron want to make positive feminine music and are influenced by 60's hipster culture and Japanese pop. This is my favorite album of the year and A&C are a great discovery to make. Enjoy!"
1,very poor,"this album lacks any sort of musical depth and know how. there is a lot better experimental stuff out there by amon tobin, boards of canada, autechure, plastikman, richard james, among others. this is, quite simply, one of the worst buys i've had in some time. save your money. and you know it would be a very poor soundtrack too."
2,TOO sticky,"This kit was a lot of fun for my girls (ages 8 & 10) to do. They could get very creative making their own transparencies to them put on a window.Unfortunately, after they were done making them and they had dried, once we did put these on the window we could not get them off without destroying them. The window art transparencies were almost permanently stuck to the window, and we had to scrap them into little pieces to chip them off the window.It's a great concept, but this product needs to be LESS STICKY."
2,"fun to do, difficult to use","my daughter had a lot of fun playing with the set, but once it is taken off the plastic, it is very flimsy and will tear apart if you arent careful. also, how do you get more paint? you only get enough paint to make like 4 decals.tip: put them in the freezer for a while, they come off much easier but they will soften again almost immediately."
3,Mas o menos...,"The music is definitely not Carlos Vives, but it gives a decent cross-section of vallenato. The sound quality is good."
4,Great Nailer Combo,I bought this combo mainly for its price. I shopped around but Amazon was the cheapest I found it. I was putting an addition on my house and it worked great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there was a bad seal which I fixed for 2 bucks.
3,A Thriller But Not Scary,"""Comedy of Innocence"" is a psychological thriller released in 2003. Thought many scenes are weak, especially the last half, there are some entertaining scenes. The plot idea is unique, which explores a child who is believed to be a reincarnation of his mother's old friend's son. He begins visiting the other woman regularly while identifying her as ""mom"" and himself as Paul, not his real name. The climax tries to build as his real mom becomes more furious. However, the attempt doesn't succeed. But the suspenseful theme is great. It keeps the audiences interested. The unanswered questions may disappoint viewers, expecially the ones that the viewers are anticipating the most. The acting is average, though there are some strong shining moments. Sometimes, such moments keep the thriller theme successfully. ""Comedy of Innocence"" may be a great movie to rent only once. Overall, mixed reviews may arise."
5,Most complete book on animal behavior I have yet encountered.,"As a dedicated student of animal behavior I have read a wide variety of texts on the subject but this book stands out in its seamless synthesis of data from ethology/behavioral ecology and comparative/experimental psychology. Previously a student seeking a complete picture of the field of animal behavior would be best served by reading several texts from psychology and biology but here a vast amount of information is presented in a clear, concise, and highly readable manner. The author has in one text presented material that will intrigue but not overwhelm the lay person, yet it will also challenge experts in the field to consider data they might otherwise not have considered.I wish I could give this book 6 stars. My only regret is not having discovered this one years ago."
4,Great Read,"I've read all the Mallory Kane books that I can get my hands on and loved each one. I was surprised to see this book had only one other review, so just wanted to add a comment that it was a good read and I would highly recommend this."
3,"Ok, but disappointed","at first, I was thrilled with how easy it was to pump out perfect cookie shapes with little effort. Later on, though, the bottom end kept popping off, as others have reported. Thankfully, I didn't have too much dough left at that point so I just formed some shapes by hand. I'm going to try it again tomorrow, and not refrigerate the dough at all (even though I thought I had softened it enough when I made these cookies), and try to hold the bottom in place so it doesn't pop out and hope that works."
2,Cookie Press,"I researched cookie presses and decided on this one. Most of the reviews were positive but when I tried to use it, I was very frustrated. While the components are of good quality, the attachment that holds the pattern shape to the end of the press does not screw on (like the older model). Instead, it slides into a guide and turns. The pressure of the cookie dough pushes the end piece off and the pattern disk is pushed off. Extremely frustrating. If only the end piece had a way to screw it on."
4,"Pretty good, but...","Nice, the box and the extra attachments and disks. I wish the disks were stainless steel, and I wish the endcaps were stainless as well, or at least I wish I were told that they were plastic. The plastic is sturdy enough, but when the dough thickens they tend to pop off. That is better than them breaking, or cracking. I don't like aluminum, and I don't like plastic. I wasn't really informed that there was both in this unit. But it is well built, and priced right. And it does make bunches of cookies. And I believe it will last a good long time. I do recommend it, I do wish there were more stainless parts."
1,Poor quality,"I literally finished making one batch of cookies and the Kuhn Rikon Stainless-Steel Cookie Press with Storage Box broke. It was an ordeal trying to squeeze the dough through the press. The pressing mechanism constantly jammed and I would have to remove the dough and place it back in again - this resulted in too much handling of the dough which is not ideal when making these butter cookies. I'm looking for the all-metal, twist-type cookie press that my mom has (& still uses)!"
1,garbage product,"I purchased this to make spritz cookies... this is the worst press I ever bought. Both ends pop off under the pressure of the relatively stiff spritz dough. The ends are not secured by a full tread, just an insecure quarter turn which does not lock into place. If you only want to use this press for frosting then maybe it will work, but certainly not for cookies. Very poor design!"
2,Kuhn Rikon Clear Cookie Press,"It is a nice product but was disappointed in the size of the tube and the disks. Also have difficulty with the lever, it is really hard to get the dough out when you near the end of the tube. The storage box is really nice. The description should give more detail as to the size of the tube and disks."
3,Loved this press as long as it worked...,"Had this press for about a year and a half. It worked wonderfully. If you are going to only make spritz cookies once or twice a year, this press will work for many years. I use mine frequently and unfortunately the bottom white plastic ring just cracked. This made the whole thing useless.... I have been using cookie presses for years. This is about my 5 or 6th one. Always look for metal ones. Even they wear out as the ridges that hold the bottom ring on, eventually wear smooth.... Did I say I use mine a lot.... Marcato made an all metal one that lasted the longest..... Trying a Wilton one now, we will see how it goes..."
5,Mescalero Magic,"The Mescalero Project is a gem. The plot is one of the most creative I have ever read. Doug Buchs writes from a knowledge base of ""facts"" that is extraordinary. The book had one message to me throughout - keep reading. Once you begin, you do not want to put it down. How these trapped men learn to live (and die) together, how they create a ""life"" under the most trying of circumstances, and how they come to grips with the fact that the rest of the world (with the exception of a villain) has forgotten about them makes this a thriller and roller-coaster read. I have recommended this book to friends who are serious readers. Hats off to Buchs on a spellbinding first novel."
2,"Sound ""bleeding"" from the right hand-side channel","Referring to the sonic of this SACD only (not the way it is interpreted...)The transfer to digital here has a sever ""bleeding"" to the right. This ""bleeding"" has the sound emanating more from the right speaker and only the last sonata (Appassionata - recorded 1963) has more or less the correct balance.Thru-out the whole recording - the piano tone is distorted in the sense that it sounds like it was recorded from behind two curtains not one curtain only...This is not the way a Steinway piano sounds like, not in a large studio and not in a concert hall.For superb piano recording one is advised to turn to (any) Decca recording.Fortunately, we have the same repertoire as on this SACD, made and recorded by Decca, with Radu Lupu (ADD recording)."
4,Great product for the price,"This is a great product for the price. Good audio quality, but the detachable face is cheaply made. what do you expect for $125? Overall, I would recommend this if you're not a hardcore audio person."
1,I was very disappointed,"After reading the ""Culture Shock"" books for Germany, Sweden, and France for trips, I was extremely disappointed with this book. It is basically a history book and gave me no real idea how to relate to Italians. Therefore, my experience in Italy was less than good. I highly recommend the France book---it is right on target and I had a great time navigating the culture."
1,Shallow and lacking detail,"I have read and used the other Culture Shock books and found them very useful.This one though was almost a complete waste of time. It was full of cliches e.g. Italians love nothing more than spending time with their family and friends. It lacked detail and useful hints about how to interact with Italians.Perhaps it suffered in comparison with ""The Dark Heart of Italy"" a far superior effort."
2,Culture Shock:Italy,"I purchased this book to learn more about doing business in Italy, and I found there was not enough detail. I did learn how vastly different each region is in Italy - - and the author tries to show the differences in each region. Perhaps this is why I felt that it didn't do a deep dive into the regions I was most interested in."
3,Never Got It,"This isn't a rating of the book, as much as a rating of the company that I ordered the book from. I ordered this book but never got it. Called the company and they refunded my money."
3,Not like in the picture,"The glossy black in the front contrast with the silver on the sides, in my opinion the colors just don't match.Unfortunately we don't see this in the pictures, although (I checked later) it is written in the description."
2,valuable and detailed text and cassettes but hard to follow,"The details make this book and cassette intro course worthwhile. But it adds unnecessary frustration because the cassette references parts of the book that are out of order. This causes the student to search back-and-forth in the book, and repeated re-rewinding of the cassette. The pronunciation guide is much more consistent and more intuitive than the Berlitz book. By mixing reading early in the dialogs, the books forces a slower rate of learning conversation Finally the dialogs in romanized and cursive Thai actually omit the English equivalents, again forcing the reader to search back and forth in the unindexed pages."
3,Just okay,"My daughter is actually the one watching this, however she has said nothing about it to me. Usually when she enjoys a particular show, she tells me about it....not this one though."
2,Lost my interest.,"The premise sounded interesting, but the characters and plot failed to come through. I didn't care about the characters. Madlax seemed too passive for an assasin plus the fact that she found it necessary to change into an evening gown in the middle of the jungle in order to shoot someone. The little girl just sat around acting strange, but doing nothing to win me over. The anime raised a few questions about how the two girls were connected, but didn't provide enough bait to keep me interested. Seems like it was aimed at an audience more interested in violence and well proportioned women than in a real plot line."
2,Not a great start,After you watch the very first episode Madlax starts to get boring. The only thing holding it up is the power it has over you for wanting to know mystery of the connection of Madlax and Margaret. These beginning episodes lack the right amount of action for this type of series. It's just plain old slow and boring and it literally puts you to sleep. It looks like the story will take forever to develop. The show does seem to have potential but because of that one mystery that bugs you. Basically the biggest problem is there is not enough action and the story development is to slow. Madlax is an assassin so why is there little action in this series. I think Madlax has great animation and potential but you have to get past volume to get to anything decent.
2,Not as great as it looks,"I flashed back to 1978 when I opened the package. This shirt is VERY disco. Unfortunately I don't go to discos, so naturally I was disappointed.I admit, I'm somewhat of a sucker for discounted things with names like ""Gucci"", ""Prada"", or ""Coach"". I'm just not as deep as I think I am.I would've been better off at Target with Isaac Mizrahi...."
2,Brass is harder than aluminum,"It's a bit pricey, but very well built, nice leather, lots of slots to put things in, heavy duty brass zipper. I got this to hold my Jornada 548, which fits nicely, very secure and snug into the case. The only killer is the zipper - a brass zipper makes a nice saw, and although the fabric it's sewn to is also heavy, there is no protection between the brass zipper and the PDA. I found this out the hard way, with zipper imprints left in the bottom of my Jornada. I've been very careful when removing PDA from case (e.g. for charging), because a careless swipe across the zipper would no doubt cut into the case, if just carrying it can dent the aluminum Jornada. I'd hate to see what would happen to a plastic PDA. So, I'm returning it in favor of a nylon zipper case or something else. Fact is, the Jornada, with screen cover, is probably safer OUT of the case and in a pocket than in the case (which fits few pockets)."
3,Nice... but expensive,"Sturdy, nice-looking, attractive color and texture.It's a little too tight for a Palm IIIc, even after taking the flip cover off, also, they must have a better method to attach the PDA other than velcro pads. Can't sync using the sync cable without removing from caseVery bad delivery - just the case in a clear plastic bag: no insert, no warranty, no instructions. It is WAY overpriced, even with Amazon's discount the only reason to buy it is if you have a free certificate."
4,Great Book!,"As expected, Helen Chen hits one out of the park with this book of delicious recipes! We have tried several of the recipes and can't wait to try them all!"
2,disappointing,"The presentation attempt to portray a therapeutic process, but actually shows a dogmatic (and a bit boring) version of CBT. There is little or no dealings with complexities and dilemmas which could enhance the viewer.The client is an actor, much of the sessions are described briefly verbally between sessions as opposed to showing what has been done. For anyone with an already basic acquaintance with CBT for panic and depression, IMHO there is little to be gained from this DVD."
2,"Somewhat Okay, but Not Worth A Lot","I was able to find a New copy of this Box Set for about 5 dollars, and for that it was worth it; however this is not worth its usual original price of about 15 or so dollars.The documentaries are short and while still interesting to watch are rather basic. One of the documentaries in this set, ""Shark: The Silent Killers"" is perhaps the more informational and interesting of them all compared to the others. What kind of foils some of the slight interest of the overall set is it use of the same footage for near the same information one or two of the other discs.Overall, this documentary set might be good in classrooms for positive information on sharks without taking up a large amount of time; but for shark loves who want a good documentary experience it falls far short."
4,The whole book is the good part,"Throughout the first two books, i've come to enjoy miss lolita files. i love her on-point dialogue and remarkable dialogue. i thought reesy was lovable, despite her shortcomings (i.e.: her irresponsible behavior). if anything can come out of reading a third book, more reesy and misty, then bring it on."
4,Pure D Entertaining,"""Gettin to the Good Part"" was a refreshing escape from the real world. Even though both ""Scenes from a Sister"" and ""Gettin to the Good Part"" were written for entertainment, there was a message to be learned about true sisterhood. Miss Lolita surrounded her colorful prose and unforgettable characters with an heartfelt message of what true friendship really is. I read both ""Scenes"" and ""...Good Part"" and what I missed most from ""...Good Part"" was Misty's thoughts. It would have been good to have intertwined the two books into one. Give us more Misty and Reesy, Lolita. In the meantime, thank you for a few moments of pure D entertainment."
3,Enjoyable Light Read,"If you are looking for more from this book than entertainment, you will be disappointed. It's a cute ""beach"" read. Nothing more. (I certainly cannot seriously compare the relationships between these ""sistahs"" with my relationships with my sistahs.) The author needs to be a little careful, however, in how she depicts black women. Reesy's character moved closer to the ""hoe"" she was concerned she was becoming than I was comforable with."
5,This one Got to the Good Part.,"GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. 'GTTGP', was awesome, this is the continuing tale of two of the best friends I've ever read about. Lolita has mastered, in only 2 outings, the art of exposing the full gamut of a warm, genuine, sometimes strained but very real friendship. This is just to real, she kept Misty and Dandre and especially Reesy human, you really believed this story. Ms Reesy's, 'hurtful payback' attitude nearly destroys friendship and a serious love interest. The dialoge is hilarious, the characters are well developed, and the story is just great. I would suggest if you can, read 'Scenes from a Sistah' first, it will increase your appreciation for this book. For you new writers, if you want to know how to do a sequel, that's 'ALL THAT' this is the mold. Jenean, you were right."
4,Very Good Read...,"I thought that this book was really good however, it cannot compare to ""Scenes From A Sistah"". I would strongly recommend this book to any woman who is going through a hard time, such as myself."
5,I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT BOOK!,"Having read SCENES FROM A SISTER, I did not think that Lolita Files would ever be able to top that. I was mistaken. This is the best book I have ever read and I regretted finishing it so fast because I wanted more. I fell in love with Misty, Reesy, Rick, Dandre, Julian and the rest of the gang. You go Lolita!"
4,Don't wait for the paperback!,"Getting to the good part is a good sequel to Ms. Files phenomenal first book Scene's from a Sista. The story line is great and there are scenes where you can;t help but laugh out loud. I felt the first book was better; however, that story was told from the point of view of my favorite character (Misty). Don't miss out on a great book."
4,Ms. Files is a great writer,"I have to applaud the author's writing skills. She was able to keep me interested in this story even though I hated the main character. Reesey did not have one redeeming quality, showed no indication of wanting to change her ways, and I felt no sympathy for her at all. However, I couldn't put this book down. Hopefully there is another book on the continuing adventures of Misty (the likable character) and Reesey in the works. I look forward to her next book."
2,I couldn't get with it.,"I am very disappointed in the sequel to ""Scenes from a Sistah"". I couldn't wait for it to come out, but when I started reading it, it didn't keep my interest. I would much rather hear about Misty than Reesy any day. Reesy is a selfish slut who doesn't even deserve to be mentioned on so many pages of this book. I think that the book had too much slang and too much cursing. There was too much, albeit protective, sex with just any and everybody. I am 2/3rds through the book, and I am using all the will power I have to finish it."
4,Enjoyable,"This sequel wasn't as bad as I thought most sequels are. I really and truly enjoyed Reesey, However, Misty didn't say much and I did kind of missed hearing from her. This book does have a real to life story line. It was very exciting and enjoyable. Can't wait to read the next one"
5,Sit back and get ready for a good laugh.,"This book is an absolute must. If you want a book that will make you laugh, then this is it. It's full of sassy, romantic and sexy dialogue. Reesy is on a mission and she refuses to let anyone stop her. If you haven't read it already, then I suggest you do. You won't regret it."
5,This book was excellent!! Definitely a must read!!,"I really enjoyed Miss Files follow-up from Scenes from a sistah!! All my emotions were in full effect. I cried, I laughed, and I shouted ""You go girl"" Misty and Reesy are like friends of mine. And by the way, since I read this book, I had to pull out my Maxwell CD and groove! Can't wait to see what Misty and Reesy are up to next!"
5,"Steamy,Intriguing and Deliciously Sexy from start to finish","Misty Fine and Reesy Snowden exhibit the kind of friendship that I have experienced with (two) of my best friends. They make you so mad you want to fight and they make you soooo happy that you don't know what you would do without them in your life. I love that they are both women enough to admit when they have made major mistakes in their relationships. I could identify with all of this plot until the very end. This is a must read for all ladies with top of the line girlfriends. I will give it as a gift for my friends in a flash. I read this book in one day, it's that great. I did not read 'Scenes from A Sistah', but after reading this book, I'm headed to the nearest book store. I'm waiting on the next Misty Fine and Reesy Snowden episode. Please tell me there will be more to come. Pleaseeeeeee. Thank you."
4,Good fast read!,"I really loved this book!!! This is the third Lolita Files novel I have read and I will be purchasing another! I found Reesy funny, brave, determained, and real.....I wasn't to crazy about the ending and that is the only reason I didn't give this book a 5 but it is a page turner, I finished it the same evening I got it...."
4,The Bearings of Friendship Between Sistah's,"Lolita Files does an excellent job of portraying the ups and downs of friendship in GETTING TO THE GOOD PART.Reesy and Misty had always been close like sistahs, but when Misty becomes engaged and Reesy becomes involved in an off-Broadway show, it's hard to determine if the friendship will last.Files shows us just how valuable friendship is, but how at some point in our lives, we have make room for ourselves to grow. This is definately a book worth investing in."
5,"Oh, yeah...this was the GOOD part!!!","I couldn't wait for this follow-up to Ms. Files first novel. It was worth the wait!!! I read this book in two sittings, couldn't put it down!!!Yeah Reesy's character is a bit much, but you have to admit, Ms. Files developed her character well. Reesy did what the reader came to believe Reesy was supposed to do. And good friends do go through phases. They do make mistakes sometimes when tyring to help each other. But just as Reesy and Misty they always get through it! I loved the new characters too! Julian was da-bomb! And Dandre was a NICE touch! And what about Reesy's parents? And Grandma Tyler. I loved this book! Can you tell? I can't wait for the next adventures for Reesy and Miss Divine!!! Thanks Ms. Files!!!"
5,From Entertaining to Excellent,"Hurray, Hurray for ""Getting to the Good Part"". To say the least, I really enjoyed this novel. I was laughing, sobbing and cheering thoughout Ressy and Misty's drama. Lolita has progressed from being merely entertaining in ""Scenes from a Sistah"" to being an excellent story teller in this new novel. This novel is a must read for readers who want to be caught up in an emotional worldwind."
3,first one much better,This book represents the typical let down that comes with the release of a part two. I love the first book. Although their was plot it seemed to be stuck in the shadow of the first book and was ever so predictible. Please lets just stick to one part and no continuation if it can't live up to it;s name.
5,HURRY WITH THE NEXT BOOK!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book!! Most authors use all these unnecessary words that you have to break out a dictionary for but Lolita Files puts it all out there, sistah style!! I can't wait for the next book!"
5,"OUTSTANDING, A MUST READ","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was so engrossed with the lives of Reesy and Misty that I nearly missed my stop on the train. Ms. Files brought out a wide range of emotions in me - I laughed, cried and cheered for Reesy. I was not disappointed with the ending - Reesy found the ""Her Knight in Shining Armour"". I can't wait for Ms. Files next book. She certainly out did herself with this ""Getting To the Good Part"". Keep the pages coming - Sistah."
2,IN THE MINORITY,I read the whole thing and didn't come away with anything I could use. I found the characters way over the top with no other explanation than a 'that's just the way they are.'Other folk's loved it. I didn't. Oh. well.
4,GOOD BOOK TO READ!,"Like many others I to have read ""Scenes From A Sistah"" and was curious to see what would unfold in the sequel ""Getting To The Good Part"".It was a pretty good story but you must continue.I have to know what happened when Reesy told Dandre about the baby etc.I didnt like that it left you hanging.Though I must confess I'd never heard of a Lolita Files before, but I'll definitly write the name down on my best author list for future purchases."
4,Pure Entertainment,"I read ""Scenes From a Sistah"" and ""Getting to the Good Parts"" back to back. Files definitely has a story to tell which is insightful, thought provoking and entertaining! The characters come to life and their personality or actions should remind you of a past or current friend/acquaintance. I was caught up in the story line and loved the way the story unfolded. Keep up the good work!"
3,It's Okay but the writing and language is a bit distracting.,"I felt the overall book was good, but more than half thru I still found myslef waiting for the good part, the climax. I also found the many grammatical and spelling errors, coupled with the fact that I almost need a tranlator to understand what was actually being said, quite distracting. I hope Ms. Files' subsequent books have seen a growth from this one."
4,Good Good Read,I really liked this book. I wish I would have read some of her books sooner. It was an interesting page turner with plenty of twists to keep you excited. And of course the book has scandals or I wouldn't of read it. ~lol~
2,WHEN will we get to the good part?,"Okay, I'm only like half way through the book so my opinion is subject to change but so far it seems as if this book was written for the sole purpose of good PR for Maxwell. Okay, so Reesy happens to be a fan of his and that's fine but can we leave it at that? The brother is mentioned on every other page! Can you give us a break? For all you Maxwell fanatics this book is a good read. But Ms. Files must keep in mind that not everyone shares her obsession. Keep your fantasies in your dreams and out of your books from now on."
2,Disappointed,"After reading SCENES FROM A SISTAH I was dying to read this one. I must say that I was sorely disappointed. Ms. Files is a good writer but it seems that she put her GOOD PART on the shelf for this one. Some of the language was cheesy and downright ugly. I know Reesy's character can be raw but it was ridiculous how shallow she was. Misty Fine however, was a little refreshing but her story line was hokey. She didn't have any depth. If your looking for shallow entertainment this one is for you. Otherwise, save your money ."
2,"I never got the to ""good part""","I am a huge fan of ""Scenes from a Sista"" and waited anxiously for the follow-up book. I have chatted with Lolita Files personally on-line and she is a wonderful, warm person, so it pains me to say that I did not like this book. Reesy is shallow and self-absorbed, and even though I understand that she and Misty are girls to the end, I found it unbelievable that Misty would put up with Reesy attitude. Misty was a doormat throughout the whole book. I'm hoping the third time is the charm for Lolita's next book."
4,"FUNNY, LAUGH OUT LOUD BUT IMPRACTIBLE ENDING","I thought this book was absolutely hilarious.The characters actually reminded me of some ""sistah"" girlfriends that I have. In that respect, it was pretty realistic and authentic. From a practical standpoint however, I thought the ending was somewhat impractical. The basis of the relationship between Dandre and Neesy ( from her perspective at least) was one based on deception, manipulation and revenge. Based on her behavior with Helmut, there was no reason for Dandre to trust Reesy again. In real life, she would have been SOL! The most poignant line in the book was when Dandre says to Neesy "" I'm saddened by the fact that I believed in something that was never really there. I hate to think that a part of me that was once very trusting and very much alive will never be that way again"". I think the ending would have been better and more realistic if it had been consistent with the above statement."
5,Better than the first,"I really loved this book. Like a lot of your readers, I read it in just 2 days. I really didn't want the story to end. I really feel like Reesy and Misty are people that I know. Lolita, you must right a sequel to this! I'll be waiting.....Lalaine LabradorLakewood, California"
5,That's right /don't settle - we know what we want,"This is a must read book....It's good to see two non-blood sisters watching each others back. Any good sister never holds back, (even if it's not what we want to hear,see,and feel). If you have a true friend, sista, sistren, this book is for you. This book is the next best thing to Gods greatest creation..... BEAUTIFUL BLACK WOMEN...."
5,Girlfriend! You Go 'Head and then Go Some More!,This book is some STRONG be tellin' it like it is type of fiction. I started reading it and could not put it down. Made my husband fix dinner for the kids while I finished reading! I highly recommend this one to others and I also just finished reading Joe Green's PSEUDO COOL. Both Mr. Green and Ms. Files have written some superb stories about African Americans!
1,Who edited this - Velvet Jones?,"I hope that Ms. Files' next book will utilize more of her considerable storytelling talents than did this overheated exaggeration. While _Scenes From A Sistah_ was enjoyably spicy, _Good Part_ reads more like the _True Confessions_ magazines we all outgrew in junior high school."
3,Scooby doo and the pizza place,Book Review by Abraham Garcia Room B1Scooby Doo the Pizza Place GhostDo you like funny books well if you do you're going to like this one. Scooby Doo and his friends try to find who is taking the missing cheese Scooby Doo smells and leads them to a whole then he finds lots of rats and much more. This is a funny book that will make you laugh from beginning to end.
2,:(,"Their first album is so good...what happened? Why is there a weird deep-voiced guy singing on the second song? Why is a 10-song album padded out to 18 tracks with a bunch of untitled ""link tracks?""In all fairness, this is a fine and ""mature"" album from the scrappy bunch of ruffians who made their brilliant, shimmering debut. It sounds more like it should be their 7th album, though, than their second."
5,Buy this album also,"Like the first release from The Gerbils, ""Are You Sleepy?"", this album is incredible. Will Westbrook's guitar playing is genius. Scott Spillane's voice is wonderfully matched to the silly, happy lyrics. If you like other Elephant Six bands, you will absolutely love the Gerbils."
4,A Nicely Flowing Album,"Don't expect it to top the grandeur of the first one. You didn't think it was possible did you? THe first is much better; however, this too is an album that massages your brain with the brilliant fingers of beautiful music. His voice is just so soulful and heart-wrenched it makes me want to cry because its what I feel inside. It goes nicely through the whole album after you listen to it a couple times. It gets better as you listen to it."
3,"yeah, what he said","it may grow on me, and it already has to some degree, but i can already tell it won't have the staying power of their silly-but-brilliant debut, are you sleepy? the structure--a very close cousin to apples in stereo's _her wallpaper reverie_--works against it, i think, to some degree, and the accessible ""hits"" seem too few and far between.as always, though, there's some nice keith moon-ish drumming, courtesy of jeremy barnes--sometime drummer for bright eyes and neutral milk hotel."
3,It's simply amazing,I love this item becouse it is sooooooooo munch like the original seson on netflix but this is the complete collection! but i ordered it about three weeks ago and it still isn't here yet can i please get it sometime amazon thank you
4,"Mechs, Romance, Comedy, and Souske","If you're looking for an anime that's got it all and really leaves you begging for a sequel, which by the way it has one and another on the way, this is definitely the anime for you!Filled with mild fan service, a cute love theme, frequent mech battles (although not up to Gundam standards), and gut-wrenching comedy, Full Metal Panic! is a great addition to any anime collection.Plot? There's an organization after a selct group of individuals known as the Whispered and it's up to teenage Lt. Sagara Souske to save their latest target: Kaname Chidori, a hot-headed high school student who detests military fan boys aka Souske.You're in for a definite treat with this one, but beware of the cheesy CG submarine."
2,Not worth the money,"Im a HUGE anime fan, but i could have done without this one in my collection. Although Full metal panic had its moments of suspense and laughs, for the most part it was VERY slow moving and it took me over a month to watch the box set. It lost my interest and the only character i really liked was souske sagara."
3,"Coaster Cedar Chest w/ Lock, Oak","Either poor manufacturer quality control, or rough handling during shipping resulted in a broken component which was not visable until the shipping package was opened and inspected. In addition, once the seller replaced the broken piece their were no assembly instructions. Fortunately my carpentry/cabinet maker experience helped me figure it out. Other than these problems once assembled I was satisfied with the looks and construction of the cedar chest."
3,Smaller than expected and hard to assemble.,I like this - but it was a bit difficult to assemble. Directions explaining how to put in the hook/key hole were not that helpful. Wish it was a bit bigger. Looks nice though! Not unhappy with my purchase.
1,Particle Board! Stinkin' Particle Board!,The kit was easy to assemble in about 2 hours and looked great. But it's a veneer of Cedar over particle board. After two months of use (opening once per 2 weeks) the particle board shredded apart at the hinge from the simple act of opening the lid. If you want it to last - Don't use it! Lasted just long enough that I couldn't get a refund.
1,Poor quality product,"Within a week of using this item, one of the hinges had pulled loose and broke off a section of the pressed board on the inside of the chest. I am very dissatisfied with the product and it is definitely not worth the price I paid for it. I will not order any more furniture using this website. A discount store carries better quality furniture than you can get here."
5,Expectations: 30 women talk about becoming a mother,"I loved this book! I read many baby/pregnancy books while waiting for the birth of our daughter, and this one was definitely the most meaningful, useful, and enjoyable. The stories are absorbing and thought-provoking, and the photos are lovely. A fabulous gift for a pregnant woman or new mother."
2,"Too Much, Too Soon","The original 1983 ROIR release - entitled, Too Much Junkie Business - was on cassette. The company initially only issued material on tape.Produced by Jimmy Miller and Johnny Thunders, it is a collection of studio demos and live material which is mostly sloppy and very uneven, as was most of his gigs. The cover art is an infamous photo of Thunders that was made into posters. Being an authorized release is a major plus, since Thunders is heavily chronicled through bootlegs or unauthorized releases.But this is an artist who is living up to a crash-and-burn legend which would ultimately kill him less than a decade later. The studio material is a work in progress and have some interesting moments. But it ultimately tells a real story that indeed is too much, too soon."
2,A little scary,"When I was reading ABARAT, I consumed almost half of it in a day. I must say that I was surprised because by then not much had happened. But if you like books with a spooky and semi-morbid twist to them, this the book for you. If you didn't like the way the fourth Harry Potter book got a little gory, this is DEFINITELY not for you. Not for the timid."
2,Read a library copy,"Before you spend money on this book, get a copy from the library. See if you enjoy reading it for sixty or so pages. We have teens who read a lot, but they couldn't get into this book at all, and neither could I. The lead doesn't have a motive or a clue, the other characters are amazing but without personality, and the plot drifts from anecdote to anecdote, getting more confused the farther into the book. This may be a case of the author being too clever for the reader, and the reviewers wanting to embrace a hyper-clever book rather than an interesting one."
2,Not too good...,"This book was interesting in the beginning. I was actually into it for the first few chapters. Then, a little later into it, the book sort of lost its appeal for me. I couldn't even finish it. I thought it would be good, but, in my opinion, it was a waste of money and time."
2,Great 1st half of a story and that's all you get...,"I found the story to be very interesting and much more entertaining than most Barker works. The problem is it's only half a story. The large type, generous spacing, and big margins lend pages to a book that's only partially there. Someone involved in this process got too greedy by putting out half a product and charging full price. Wait until a compilation edition comes out that adds the stories together and you will actually get a complete product for your money. At that point I would reccomend it."
2,"brilliant illustrations, dreadful prose","The illustrations are fantastic, but Barker's writing made me want to hurl. His prose is not alive, and it's full of cliches. Furthermore, the episodic nature of the story failed to hold my interest. The terrific paintings are the only reason to read this book, which without them would be a complete insult to readers worldwide."
4,Good but not his best,"As a longtime fan of Clive Barker, I was chomping at the bit to read this novel. I have to admit that though it was good, it was not his best. I loved the artwork and thought his characters were very well thoughtout but at the same time, the novel felt like it was a revisit to Gulliver's Travels and other such mythic quest novels. I liked it and felt it deserved four stars and will read more from the others in the series but still, if you want Clive at his best, try Cabal, Books of Blood, and Coldheart Canyon."
3,An interesting read,"I'm re-reading this book, not because I particuarlly liked the style of writing, but just so I could sort the plot out in my head, to get ready to read the next three- once my library gets them.The illistrations, however are beautiful. In answer to the person who told clive barker to take art lessons- please. The man uses a unique style- it seems simple when you first look at it, but you're drawn in by the complexity of the colours.The plot, is fine, if a pit predictable at times. It's obvious that Mr. Barker has a fabluous imagination, judging by the discriptions of the Abarat, and I'm hoping the plot will sort itself out in the next three books.Go ahead and read, but be careful before spending [the money] on it."
4,Fabulous Book,"I love fantasy, especially children's fantasy, and I've read many books of this genre. Abarat is deffinately high on my list of favorites. Candy is likable, all the characters are great, and, as the many other reviewers have mentioned, I couldn't put it down once I started reading. Enlightening, truely. If you feel like you were meant for more than the mundane, or are hoping to fulfill you're destiny, this book may give you valuable advice. Read it if you have found truth in these words.peace"
4,"good art, so-so book","i love Clive Barker's Thief of Always. It is one of my fav readings several years ago. when i saw Abarat, I had to give it a try. It is the first book of 4. On first read you may be disappointed (like i was) if you don't realize that. Barker isn't as good as Stanek in setting up a series take a look at kingdoms and elves of the reaches if you don't believe me. he does though have a story to tell. you can tell the next book should be better.Overall, this isn't interesting but not uninteresting, just average. The main character, Candy, is a bored girl who stumbles onto a magical world. i couldn't really tell what the purpose of the adventure was though, what it was for or about. this is mostly a neat concept. i'd rather recommend stanek's book mentioned before. There at least we know what the bored main character, Adrina, wants to do and what her journey is about."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IN KINDLE/KINDLE APP FORMAT! Get a hard copy.,"The book is good. However, it is hugely lost in this format because none of the beautiful images created for this story are included. There's well over 100 images in the book that are not in the kindle version Buy a hard copy. It's worth it."
2,Disappointment,This is only half a book. I hate when they only write half a story and you need to wait for the next book for the rest of the story.
5,Arabrat: a release from everyday world,"I am a high school student who has a passion for reading and is very good at it. Arabrat is undoubtedly one of the best books i have ever read. It amused me because of the wonderfully depicted characters, which were also illistrated, and very well i might add. This book helps you escape from everyday life and the days that slowly drag by. I loved it, give it a chance it's worth every minute!"
2,Abarat can be tough going!,"Clive Barker, where are you going with this series? I read the book-on-tape version (missed the great illustrations so doing) and right up to the end I still cannot figure out where Barker is going with this story. Barker is very capable of writing a great childrens story: The Thief of Always is wonderful and a must read for all of Barker's fans of any age. I kept waiting for the great revelation/resolution in Abarat, but it never came. Perhaps in the sequel?"
2,Bland,"Really wasnt impressed with this. There is no warning that this is not really aimed at a mature reader and was given it as gift. Having read almost all his other books and enjoyed them this was a shock to the system. I found it totally without substance, and whereas certain ""young adults"" books are readable, this was tepid, and really had very little about it at all. As Clive is writting a set, i think perhaps it will be a while before i next pick up a book by him, which is a shame as he is such a creative talent"
3,Great book...but not exactly geared for children,"I loved this book and, as other reviewers have said, am very pleased that Barker is starting to write like his old self again. However, his target audience for this book is way too young. Not merely because of content, but because of word usage. The vocabulary used is above most high school students, never mind younger children. I loved the book, but cringed when someone was stabbed in the leg with a dagger complete with blood spray. I just think that he could have either cleaned it up for children, or made it targeted for an adult."
1,Terrible.,"A completely terrible book. Barker takes a typical storyline (a girl is bored with her hum-drum life and stumbles onto an exciting one) and just adds oddities and strangeness to the point that you start to gag every time his eight-headed character (who is oddly reminiscient of Snow White's seven dwarves all wrapped up into one convenient, silly-to-the-point-of-stupid package) opens its mouth. Some may say it's childish and stupid because it's a children's book, but I say it's rubbish.If you buy it, buy it for the cover art, which is decent."
1,Most honest review you'll ever read,"This book feels like an extremely long introduction, but to what? The story never begins and there is no real ending. Big disappointment and very annoying since I read the whole thing."
1,What the heck???,"As a so-called Young Adult [though older than the Harry Potter crowd] I think they REALLY missed the boat on this one. The art is interesting, but really out of place in the age range, and the writing is bad. It is a weird idea to put the Pinhead man up as a writer for kids in the first place. Not that kids don't like horror, but this is like Charles Addams without the talent. This book is ...not all that interesting."
3,Let down,"This book has amazing imagery and beautiful language, no doubt. But at the end of the novel I felt myself wondering ""Why did I read this again?"". I enjoyed the use of tie-ins. I liked how all the characters revolved and related to each other. However, I felt that much of the language in the book was quite repetitive in nature. Most of the story line should have progressed a lot faster than it did. When I don't find myself finding time in my day to read a new book- it's usually not a good thing. Overall, this book is o.k. It's not making me want to read the next book in the series."
1,abarat/perplexed,"Most of the reviews for this book are good, so maybe something is wrong with me, but I gave this book about 125 pages and it just wasn't clicking for me. I like to give a story a fair shake and I admit I paid my hard-earned cash because of the art work and the fact that this book was well put together. The quality is there, but the text. . .It seemed like Clive Barker was just writing whatever came to mind, like a stream of consciousness type deal. I'll try again, but I'll be honest it'll be when I'm good and bored and hard-up for a read."
3,Trippy in a good way,"Abarat was a pretty legit fantasy book. I mean it would be hard to get any more fantastical than this. The world described was a feast for the imagination that actually made my brain hurt a couple of times. As much as I thought the illustrations were very clever and well-done, I almost wish they hadn't been there so my imagination could have run even more freely. Beyond that, it did seem disjointed at times, but maybe that can be attributed to the fact that I have only read this, book 1. The main girl, Candy Quackenbush, is about as boring as the town she comes from, which makes the story a bit irritating because, of course, I find myself only wanting to read about the more interesting characters (like Christopher Carrion). Near the end of the book, there was no more suspense for me because I was so bored with Candy I didn't really care if she lived or died. But some of the other characters are very interesting and much make up for it.Overall, slightly crazy but enjoyable."
3,Scientific Anglers DVD - Fly fishing made easy.,"I was rather disappointed with this DVD as it is really dated. Sure techniques live on and dont change that much but for a company backed by 3M and as well known as SA, I cannot believe that they cant put together a modern video that todays young angler could identify with after all, you dont want them to laugh at the outdated kit etc."
2,Not worth the price,"The video does cover the basics of fly fishing, but it spends almost as much time promoting fly fishing lodges and fly fishing accessories. There isn't much beyond basic camera angles, either, which would have helped the beginer to see casting from multiple angles, etc.I've found a lot better quality stuff on YouTube, and it's hard to beat the price of ""free."""
5,Fly Flishing Made Easy,"I found the DVD very informative. It was comprehensive enough in nature to be very helpful, yet it was condensed enough not to be repetitive or boring. Great article guys.."
3,Giant Cookie,"The cookies are good but not so good when they are melted into one ""giant cookie"". For the price I paid for shipping this product, I expected better. The cookies should be in packaging so they are not subject to temperature extremes or they should not ship these in the summer!"
2,No Not Again,They were old and crumbly some broken the chocolate on top of each cookie had crumbs and over all not
2,Dreadful Disapointment,"The projects are wonderful to look at, but unless you are a ""hot"" knitter who can adjust your patterns on the fly steer clear. If you must knit one of her patterns KNIT A GUAGE and then KNIT IT AGAIN. If you are looking for a wonderful intermediate pattern book try Weekend Knits or the Stich n' Bitch book, if you want a nice coffee table knitting book by all means spend go for it."
2,a knitter in colorado,"At first, I was excited to find a knitting book with easy, modern designs. Then, once I made my first project, I realized her sizing was on the small side, even a large was too small, and I'm mot a large person.The smaller projects in the book are nice for gifts, but I would skip the sweaters. Also, many of the projects would be better suited to circular knitting. Know one wants to seam a hat that can be knit in a circle to begin with!Her directions are vague at times, and her finishing techniques don't really give a professional look. I find it hard to believe she finishes her own garments this way."
3,Good with the Bad,"I fell in love with the pictures in this book, as I love simple, bold designs. It's a great inspiration for me. That said, it can also be highly annoying to read and work with. The name-dropping is intrusive after the first page or so. Also, the sizes are INCREDIBLY small. Suss' ""large"" is listed in the X-Small category of standard women's sizes! Unless the reader is willing to do all the math to alter what are, essentially, good designs, I wouldn't recommend this book for beginners."
1,A gigantic confidence trick,"First up, I want to know what's 'designer' about knitting a rectangle in garter stitch or a very long very narrow tube? Then there are some utterly silly projects - knitted covers for mobile phones, golf clubs, etc. - which remind me of those awful knitted crinoline ladies to cover toilet rolls and teacosies. There are some real garments - sweaters, cardigans - but they seem to make a virtue out of being badly finished. Also, 'large' equates with 36"" bust, which may be OK for Hollywood stick insects but most folk would be disappointed. Wasted money, I'm afraid. Anyone who'll pay postage can have mine for free."
4,Beginner Perfect! Great Instructions and Beautiful Designs,"As a newbie knitter in my twenties, this is my favourite book. The projects are simple, the photos are gorgeous, and I can see returning to this book for years to come because I love the designs so much. The step-by-step instructions are great and I wish more books were written this way. (I can't stand knitting by antiquated abbreviations.)I did have a couple of problems. There are a lot of misprints in the book. If you buy the book, be sure to visit www.sussdesign.com to get the list of corrections before you begin any of the projects. I also wish she included instructions on how to crochet the pieces together, since this is a finishing technique used often throughout the book.Overall, a book I would readily recommend to other beginning knitters. Well worth the price."
1,Don't Bother!,"Please, This is one incredibly boring book! The only worthwile element are the photos of the authors famous ""customers"". This book is enough to bore a newbie to tears. If you are looking for a fun begginers book, look at Hip to Knit, or the Yarn Girls Guide to Simple Knits."
2,Frustrated,"I just finished her casual sweater that is on the back cover. I'm a size 4 and I made the medium size and it still does NOT fit. The pattern was easy enough to follow but I did get confused on the neck a bit.My son (7 yrs old) made the nubby scarf as his first project for a friend. I made the matching hat to go with it but then was stuck when I had to crochet the cord for the top. There were no instructions to do this. I finally tracked down a friend that can crochet and she did it for me. It did look cute when we were finished.I won't be trying any more patterns from the book, I am going to try the ""Yarn Girl's Guide to Simple Knits""."
2,The good and the bad,"She has some very nice designs and great projects and suggestions, but....THERE ARE NUMEROUS ERRORS!!! I found this out the hard way. You expect that a knitting pattern is correct. These errors range from incorrect number of stitches to cast-on, number of skeins required, incorrect finished length and just plain wrong directions. If you purchase this book make sure you consult her web site (sussdesign.com) for the errors associated with the patterns."
2,"If you love knitting, don't bother with this book","There are plenty of nice pictures, but no meat.If you love knitting, like I do, this book will only discourage you. But if you want a book to look at pictures, This is yours."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book was one BIG disappointment! All it really is, is a bunch of name dropping, who she knows, who she has knit for, etc. Out of the 30 designs, I might make 6. If you are going to spend money on a knitting book, get the Yarn Girls Guide to simple knits!"
2,Only buy this book if you are a Suss fan,"this book is full of errors that (when you go to the site) you have pages of corrections to go thru. This was a terrible book. It has 'famous' people in it, so if you want a book with famous people who knit, etc. then this is the book for you. If you aren't a fan of Suss, don't buy it."
3,Fun Book,"While this is a fun book for anyone to read, I have to say I wish it had more patterns. Many of the patterns although cute, aren't exactly practical. I did like some of the sweaters, however two of them are almost exactly alike. I don't think I'll knit a cell phone cover, or water bottle holder, but it was interesting to see that people actually have done that. I think I would have liked this book a lot better if it gave more of a variety of patterns. But it was fun to read and see how the rich and famous like to knit."
2,Not expecting,The designs were a bit tastless. First review this book at the library before buying it. I wouldn't recommend this book at all.
2,Nice start for beginners,"I saw a pattern from Hollywood Knits in the Winter 2002 Knits mag. It was super simple, but the style of it elevated it above your typical, dowdy beginner pattern. Liking that pattern, I took a look at this book in a yarn shop. I was not that impressed with the look of any of the other designs. Were I a beginner, I would want to knit one of Suss's designs for a beginner project, but after that I would want to move on to more techniques. If you are not a beginner, you could probably knit any of the projects just by looking at them, without reading the directions. The designs are that simple and straightforward. Unfortunately, most of the designs are not elegantly simple, they are just plain simple. As in Girl Scout troup. On the other hand, Suss uses great yarns, many of which I was not aware of and would really like to get my hands on."
1,Error not corrected even on website,"The patterns are all so simplistic that it seems to imply that Hollywood types are all ADD-afflicted. There is a difference between a simple, timeless pattern that lets the beauty of the yarn shine, and a crude, poorly written one. Unfortunately the patterns of this book falls into the latter category.Too bad that I gave one of the patterns, the leather tie cardigan, the benefit of the doubt and started knitting it. The instructions omitted several rows at the top of the sleeve so that the finished piece measures 13"" rather than the specified 17""! I looked for corrections on her website. Even on the corrections page, this glaring error was not corrected. How poorly written and edited can a book get?!The copy I use is a library copy. Even then, it is not worth the investment of my time."
2,A Lifestyle Book with Knitting In It,"Demi-celebrities are different from you and me. They're skinnier. How else could they make use of sweater patterns that top out at 36 inches, and tube and halter tops that appear to be sized for prepubescents? The instructions seem to range from mostly clear to inanely detailed (40+ rows of row-by-row instructions for a scarf). The name dropping (all over every page) somewhat impedes the flow of information.I have to think of this book as something like one of those gourmet cookbooks that assumes that you have a food processer, a stand mixer, a spare oven, and the willingness to measure out four onces of egg white and one third of a cup of chopped onion. It's not so much about cooking (or knitting), but about imagining what it would be like to live that way."
