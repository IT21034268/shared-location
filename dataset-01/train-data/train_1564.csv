1,0 star,"Afetr I thouroly read the book and practiced for 1 week, I concluded it doesn't help me improve my reading skills or comprehension at all. It only makes you think you do.Please don't buy the book.PhotoReading only teach you to see books, not to read books. You won't comprehend anything by seeing books.Comprehension is really about decoding.Everyone can see thousands of words at a time, but that doesn't mean he can decode thousands of words at a time.Stop wasting time PhotoReading. Try to improve your decoding speed instead."
1,Quackery,"Essentially, this book is composed of information that can be found in other books, but has either been given a new name or changed to fit in his system.The author claims that if one sits and flips through a book at a rate of one page per minute our conscious mind will not recall any of it but our subconscious mind will store it and then we will later be able to recall it by using certain techniques.He says to ""Preview the book before you photoread, and then to rapid read and skim the book after you have photoread it.""If you follow the system, you will find that the information gained (if any) is that which was ""previewed, rapid read and skimmed."" The ""photoreading"" step is bogus and does not reap any anything, thus the book needs a new title or should be taken off shelves.The book has a bunch of testimonials on the first 4 pages of his book, on the back and has various stories throughout of people who have benefited from this system. Don't be fooled!"
1,It's NOT working,"I've tried The Whole Self Learning Coarse and it's a waste of time, energy and nerves, just makes you annoyed and paranoid."
1,I can photoread this book in just 1 minute!,"This book is 5% content 95% marketing.After reading this book with such an agresive marketing in which Scheele spends whole chapters advertising his other products without giving you any useful information, I started to wonder how many of the reviews in this forum are reliable. Just as an exercise check out any other hot book and compare the number of reviews it gets. It does not even approach half this one! I have no doubt that Scheele marketing department has a lot to do with many of the 5 star reviews of this book especially when the one star reviews start to catch up.As far as the 5% content of the book, you can get most of the information from some detailed reviews found here.Many of the concepts touched in the book like previewing a book and mind mapping are certainly valuable however they are better covered in other books."
1,it deserves no stars...,"I actually took the Photoreading course, and got the book as part of the course. I did NOT read faster, I had NO improvement in comprehension, and could not make any sense of anything in the way of ""techniques"" as taught by the instructor. Here is a link (not sure if Amazon will edit it out) to the NASA photoreading study: ""[...]"".Better spend your money on a real speed reading course, such as the Power Reading Course with Audio CD, or the more expensive Reading Genius from Nightingale Conant..."
1,Don't be suckered,"It sounds great doesn't it? Read a book as fast as you can turn a page, almost science fiction. You'll notice those who gave it 5 stars claim you must be open minded, accepting of the teachings. Almost like they are recruiting you for a cult. Probably their cult which is members recruited by the author/publisher to write glowing reviews so you will buy the book. Here's a tip I learned after being burned by another book that was pure trash but received glowing reviews by almost everyone. Head over to any other major book site where customers write reviews and see if the same people have copied and pasted their glowing reviews over there. Yup, probably have.If you get this book because you think you will be transformed into this magical, speed reading god, think again. Get a decent book on speed reading that claims down to earth results (double your rate) by using accepted techniques."
5,A Definite Best-Buy!,"I started reading this book, and I couldn't put it down. What a great plot! It is definately one I will read, re-read, and re-read again. It's always like the first time! I felt like I was part of the story. It's like watching a gripping movie. One of my all-time favorites."
3,Great Read!,Kathryn Reiss is a great author. Ive read several of her books and enjoyed everyone...if you like time warp books you'll like these
5,Never enough clamps...,"I use these little clamps for woodworking. They are just the ticket for those real small pieces that you can't get a ""real"" clamp on when glueing up. They exert plenty of pressure and can be applied with one hand. You can also get away with using just a corner of the clamp if the piece is real small. I have some that I have glued small rubber pads to, so they will not mark softwood pieces. These are very handy and I have a wide selection of sizes. Recommend you give em a try. Very inexpensive and very usefull."
3,Good But Not Good,"I bought this game at Target for $9.99 and I was excited about running my own school. But when I booted it up for the First time I realized that this was not the game that the cover of the game advertised. in the first place, when litter gets out of control you can't get it back in control no matter how manny janitorial buildings you have or how many janitors you have. It is hard to find a teacher with fun rated 10, strictness rated 5, and skill rated 10 which is what you have to have in order to make students happy. It seems no matter how many bathrooms I have students are leaving the school because of no bathrooms. When you go bankrupt after 3 days you lose your school no matter what. They don't even let you keep the school just with no money. They make you lose all of your hard work and start over. Please do not buy this game if you are not ready to face a big challenge."
2,Still Good,"This game is fun! You get to run your own school, create your own kids, and get good teachers.But this game has its difficulties. Like the review below, you can't get your litter in control with ease, but I found that you could if you kept moving your janitors. It's hard to find good teachers, and don't you think a video game arcade, roller coaster, etc is a little much for a school? It also says ""If you want to build portable detention, build a port a potty"". What does a port a potty got to do with a detention?Yeah, it's fun for a while, but you get bored with it soon. But I'd still get this game if you really wanted it."
1,Creased cover - unfortunate since it was for a gift,While overall the process of working with this vendor was fine - the book arrived with a seriously creased front cover. I had bought this as a graduation gift for a future dental student and had no time to return it before graduation. I was very disappointed.
1,Abysmal,"Before I start this review, I should mention one important thing. I have not read this book. I have, however, read the first 20 pages and that was enough to make me realise how truly bad it was. Amateurish prose, cliched characterization and shocking dialogue, I can't find a single thing to recommend about what I read.I may have to finish it one day, and then marvel at how it ever made it into print.I am not a vindictave person but I felt I ought to redress the balance of such glowing reviews. Please, please, read the first few pages yourself so you know what you're getting yourself in for.I should have known better."
2,Sloppy Sloppy Sloppy!,"I'm not ready for the exam yet, but already I've picked out numerous typos, goof-ups and errors. Seriously it seems like they didn't even bother to proof read it before printing. The more I read the angrier I get - there's no excuse for this kind of sloppiness in a text that deals with very complicated material, where subtle differences in meaning make a HUGE difference for the exam. I'm tempted just to not finish reading it, it's very difficult to read, worded poorly and circularly, and often just does more to confuse me than help. The full size study guide is much better. Read that first and then approach these exam notes critically, and DON'T rely on them. If in doubt check your facts with other sources, cause this book can't be trusted."
3,Full of errors and typos.,"I typically don't bother writing reviews but the quality of this book is upsetting. In terms of the content this book is alright but don't expect to get away without one of the larger ones. This is only a brief review after all and sometimes not well explained. However, I must say this book is the lousiest quality I have seen for a while now. More errors and typos than all the books together I have read during the last year. Be aware, this book is brief and compact and it gives you a lot of brief and compact misinformation."
4,The best of the three,"The pacing is odd at times and the book could have done with the last couple of chapters being stretched out somewhat, but in the end this is a fairly satisfying read. The best part, from the point of view of someone who has read most of John Christopher's post-apocalyptic young adult fiction (bizarre genre, no?), is that Christopher *finally* manages to develop some decently written, even believable, female characters. Pity that strength is set to crash and burn in the third volume of the series."
2,Beware,I just bought this for my 4 and 6 year olds. They love Pokemon and I thought it would be great for them to explore and print out the characters. Even though the age is geared towards 1st-5th grade I thought there'd be enough to print and watch. Not so. Beware if your buying for young children you'll be disappointed. It also doesn't have a lot on it. It's quite limited.
4,Good,It was a gift for my husband and the only thing he didnt like was that the radio didnt charge his batteries otherwise everything was great.
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A DEWALT FAN, BUT DECIDED TO TRY THE MILWAUKEE BRAND- BIG MISTAKE! THE SAWZELL WORKED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OUT OF THE BOX BEFORE THE SWITCH AND BUSHINGS WENT BAD AND THEN THE METAL CHUCK ON THE DRILL IS OUT OF BALANCE AND VIBRATES. ALTHOUGH THE SERVICE CENTER WAS HRLPFUL, DEWALT MAKE A FAR SUPERIOR PRODUCT. THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING..."
3,Where is he going?,"Love Joe, but he's off in a new direction, does it well, but, miss the old style. This is more jazz and Im not sure that is a good genre for him."
2,He must owe money to the clarinet player.,"I've heard a couple of Joe Henry's albums and have really liked them, so I was looking forward to this one. It's too bad he gave some the instrumentalists free reign to play whatever out-of-tune junior-high-level improvisation they felt like. Throw out the clarinet player, and it's still a pretty good album. But as is - especially for anyone with an ear for jazz - it's unlistenable at times."
2,VERY OVERRATED,"Critics and record store clerks are going gaga over this album, but I just don't hear it. Henry creates layered soundscapes, but rather than reward repeat listens, they aggravate the listener--at least this listener. The more I listen to this album, the less I like it.His lyrics are crafty and clever in places, but they don't provide deep insight. How many times do we have to listen to more-alienated-than-thou singer-songwriters lament the loss of innocence in our corrupt modern world. This would have been edgy stuff in 1991, but today it sounds trite. Henry's delivery makes it worse. I can see him dressed in black smoking clove cigarettes, pretending to be serious but really looking down the sundress of a young suburban acolyte."
5,Nailer Pins,"I have the GREX 635 pin nailer so I bought these pins for use in it. I have used these pins for many different jobs. I have used it to attach wooden cut-outs to my picket fence as well as for installing crown molding throughout my house. I never once experienced even a single pin jam, missfire, failure to insert below the surface of the wood or break. These pins have performed flawlessly and I highly recommend them."
1,Not very durable,"After a year of light use the plastic frame deformed and the gears no longer mesh. This happened during the operation where you remove the cork from the screw. If you get one, be sure to buy extra screws and replace as soon as there is any significant resistance to removing the screw from the cork. Perhaps the teflon failed; perhaps it was an extra dense cork. In any case my wine opener has failed after little use when I lifted hard to remove the cork from the screw."
4,I liked it,I don't think Zero Woman R is the best in the Zero Woman series. But it is one of the better ones. Atsuko Miura does a good job of playing the sexy assassin.
4,"Fast paced, highly readable, & filled with humorous insight","Lynda Curnyn has written a wonderful novel that depicts the relationship woes of single New Yorker Emma Carter, a woman who is pining for her boyfriend who has relocated to LA.Likes: The writing style and narrative voice are easy to follow, using wit, humor, and contemporary attitudes regarding men, women, sex, dating, and friendships.Things to watch for: I think the writer wanted to stay true to the theme of her book, the fact that Emma longs for Derrick, her ex, however, it seemed every single chapter reiterated this point which probably wasn't necessary but isn't a major flaw.If you're looking for a fast-paced novel with a New York setting that will make you laugh and is highly identifiable in terms of relationships, then Confessions of an Ex-Girlfriend should make a fine and enjoyable read."
3,We've all been there...,"Emma Carter is an insecure 30-something who feels overweight and is newly single. Her mom is getting re-married, sort of taking her turn, her brother is hapilly hitched and her friends are single by choice or hooked up. After her boyfriend moves to LA without inviting her along, Emma faces the realities of the dating & dieting world, and an infirm grandmother who incessantly asks how her boyfriend is. A cute easy read."
2,Disappointing,"I was in the mood for ""chick lit"" when I picked this book up, so was predisposed to enjoy it. But although it had amusing moments, I was fairly bored throughout. None of the characters are really defined, and the main character is derivative of far too many other books, television shows and movies. There are better ""Bridget Jones"" ripoffs out there."
3,I confess: I liked it.,"Lynda Curnyn's first novel is a wry look at breaking up over thirty, but you don't even need to be near that milestone to feel Emma's pain. She goes through every stage of the grieving process in a way that's painfully honest (and somewhat embarassing for those of us who've been there before). Though at times a little cliched, Emma's struggles are portrayed in a totally relatable and comical way.All in all, a good book. But Curnyn's second effort, ENGAGING MEN, is much better."
1,With so many good books out there...,"...don't waste your time with this one.The writing is unforgivably mediocre, the plot is painfully predictable and the characters make you roll your eyes in irritation. I'm sure the author wants this life she has created on paper, and hopefully she'll get it one day. But in the meantime I truly hope she'll just stop asking the reading public to suffer through her fictional wishings.There are many well-written and funny and smart books out there (try ""It's My F#cking Birthday"" by Markoe, ""Her"" by Zigman, or anything by Eleanor Lipman). Search around to find one that won't be as disappointing."
3,The title is misleading,"Though the book was very interesting the title was rather misleading. Its a fun quirky read that at times makes you laugh out loud but the title and cover made me think it was going to be a little more provacative then it was. It is fun, I just expected a little more scandal from it."
5,Loved It,"This book is the perfect antidote to a breakup. Reading it made me laugh and feel better about myself. And even if you didn't just get dumped...read it anyway, because it will make you smile!"
2,Boring and Simpleminded,I had to force myself to finish this book just so I could get my money's worth. This book lacked depth. I felt that the author rushed through crucial parts of the book and spent too much time writing about petty things. The end was blah and the characters were boring and unentertaining. When I read a fun book I want to be taken on at least a little bit of an adventure and frankly my life is more interesting than Emma Carter's is.
3,entertaining but ultimately useless,"In this Red Dress Ink novel (the label, as usual, is telling), newly dumped Ex-Girlfriend Emma Carter must navigate the pitfalls of her magazine job and her married (or almost-married) friend, coworkers, and mother - not to mention dating in New York.Everything about this book is ... acceptable. It has plot elements aside from the inevitable dating-and-mating issues, but that subplot is clearly secondary (and not entirely devoid of dating-and-mating issues itself). The narrator is not grossly offensive to the sensibilities of any remotely independent woman, but her struggles seem a little more appropriate to someone much younger than she is supposed to be. The writing is smooth but nothing special. On the whole ""Confessions of an Ex-Girlfriend is entertaining but not very satisfying."
2,Another boring single-something book,"Slightly better than some of this genre, but not much - still boring and predictable."
3,Good,Good book but thought it could have moved a little faster. Not what I thought it was going to be about but in the end I enjoyed it.
3,Good confessional,"Confessions follows the growth of its protagonist Emma Carter. Her development as a woman and a writer starts its journey when her boyfriend of 2 years breaks up with her and moves across the country. Forced into singlehood she starts to reevaluate the people and things in her life that are important to her and this leads her on the path to self-discovery. She discovers what she'd lost most during her ill-fated relationship; herself. This book is a fun, light read and anyone who's ever been through a break up or had self doubts can relate to this novel."
3,Tim Rides the Range,"Not a bad little B western.Tim is in good form,and his acting is prettygood.Use of doubles is extensive during the fight scenes.Columbia had twoof the best cowboy stars in their ""corral"" during the early 1930's....Buck Jones & Tim."
4,Good for overnight,"I'm normally and Always Infinity girl. I got a box of Kotex as a sample. The Ultra Thin Overnight is nice and long. The adhesive strip is wide and holds everything in place, really one of the best I've seen. I don't have to worry about it coming off and moving around. The wings are place towards the front end so the back is longer and a little wider. That makes it good for nighttime but not as practical for heavy flow during the day. I like how thin the pads are, but they are a little stiffer than Always Infinity. It's a good product. I'm still trying to decide which one I like better."
5,Wonderful book,"This is a must-have. In addition to providing pragmatic advice about setting up a business and establishing oneself, in a beautiful introduction Braufman (sp?)describes his journey and the value of art in our lives. It was a transformative book for me and helped me clarify my goals and purpose."
1,don't waste your time..,"It hits higher end bass ok at best and descent low low end for a 10"" but there is not a punch like a 10"" should have. The actual SD (Look it up. It's the cone Surface Area in cm or inches. MORE SD IS BETTER FOR BASS ADDICTS) is so low that it would take a wall of these to be anything awesome. Look into an Alpine SWR or SWS 10"" subwoofer if you have looked at this.. honestly... I keep mine around for when we are testing connections or like when we I blew my 12""SWS or to diagnose an issue.... I experimented when I bought this and failed. I graduated to an Alpine SWR12D2 eventually and now I'm getting what I really wanted to hear. For REASONABLE PRICES look elsewhere on amazon or something for some real quality subs, not KOLE owned by Power Acoustic that is a discontinued project. Check out Alpine sws and swr 10"" and 12"" subs. I love my SWR @1ohm, all day booms. So will you. Promise."
4,Works as it should.,It's a nail punch. You use it to punch nails. It performs this function well. It appears to be very well made.
3,Lost Goat - 'Equator' (Man's Ruin),"Not sure if this was a full lp or an EP.Either way it features seven tracks,with a running time of 35 minutes.I consider Lost Goat to be old school heavy rock.Tunes that I sort of thought stood out were ""Bitter Pill"",the ass-kicking ""White Dog/Purple Pussy"" and ""Poison"".You might say their sound is like Raging Slab meets Megadeth.Recommended for for them no-life adolescents,'60's throw backs,head cases and drama queens that often hang out at 4am at the local minimart thumbing through Metal Edge magazine always talking about how GOOD their life could've been.You know who you are."
3,Nice...but not the Rankin/Bass classic,"While this is an okay, traditionally-animated movie starring Robbie Benson of Beauty and the Beast fame, I need to point out (as a warning to Rankin/Bass fans looking for the stop-motion animation feature from 1985) that this is not the same thing. This item refers to a 2000 feature. Compare IMDB's tt0089488 (1985) with tt0267675 (2000) for a complete comparison."
5,BEST CHRISTMAS MOVIE EVER!!,"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!! I love the music, the voices, the story. All of it! It is calming for little ones, yet interesting to keep older ones attention. Nice way to relax in the evening with a mug of cocoa and Christmas cookies! I love how it explains Santa's immortality and reindeer and how he came to be our beloved Santa!"
3,Pale shadow of the stop motion version,"This version of The Life and adventures of Santa Claus is a pale, saccharine sweet sham when compared to the supurbly done stop motion animation of the 1985 version of this same story done by Rankin / Bass. This felt cheesy and half-hearted whereas the stop motion animated one has the distinct feel of a classic and was more true to the heart and feel of the old story by L. Frank Baum.The story is good but it feels dumbed down compared to the stop motion version. A seldom known fact, Baum connected this story to his loved The Wizard of Oz by saying the immortal faeries of this story are the ones who enchanted the land of Oz to begin with."
3,read the book,Okay let me start by saying I have NOT watched this movie but I was intrigued by the title as I have read the book by L. Frank Baum yes the same author that wrote the Wizard Of OZ and I have to say I loved the way he wrote it and it is an amazing way to look at Santa Claus and all that happened truly a wonderful book!
5,Great Christmas Movie,Anyone with children any age who like Christmas or Santa Clause stories should like this movie. This movie should stimulate all of your emotions. It has a great story line and characters and gives a somewhat Pagan theory of the legend of Santa Clause yet still has Christian morals of what is right and wrong. The animation and story are well done and written. If you have no imagination don't bother. If you want your children to have good morals and stimulate their imaginations you will enjoy.
5,I found it!,I remember being 12 when I first saw this one winter day. I always looked for it everywhere. It is a great movie for children and the story is beautiful. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to share the traditional story of Christmas with their kids.
3,Bought for nostalgia,"This movie is pretty silly. I bought it for nostaligic purposes. I will probably never watch it again, but it's cute for kids."
4,The Origins of Santa Claus,"This is one of the earlier Rankin/Bass productions which differs a bit from the traditional Christmas Specials that most of us remembered growing up.The story is told with a 'new age' twist and is filled with fantasy. It's a mystical tale which brilliantly and simply explains the origins of the immortality of Santa Claus and many of his associated traditions of Christmas. Although it's a bit off the beaten path of holiday classics, The Life and Adventures of Santa Clause captures the essence of some universal themes such as the struggles between good & evil and the nature of humanity. It also includes the typical universal holiday themes of peace, joy and goodwill.This is another holiday favorite that both kids and adults will enjoy."
4,"Adults enjoyed it, too.","We bought this for our 5 yr. old grandson, but all the adults enjoyed watching it, too. We had our holiday dessert when watching it but the grandson was too busy being glued to the screen to eat his dessert."
5,he life and adventures of santa claus,I saw this on cable over five years ago and fell in love with it. I've been looking for this version on DVD ever since. I'm so happy it finally came out on DVD. This story starts out with Chris being a young child and how he grew up to be what we call Santa Claus. It's a heart warming story that's great family entertainment. Surely to become a tradition for me and my grandchildren at holiday time.
4,My thoughts,I would recommend this to the advanced manga reader. I got the feeling of a three or more sided love triangle and I wondered what would happen next. Over all it is a pretty good manga.
5,Great But Only For So long,"When I bought this from Amazon I thought...oh great!Is this gonna be the same one, but I most certainly was wrong!This is a book you'll cherish and love.It first starts out at the Sohma house.You will find many funny things relating to humor!Such as,Yuki Sohma in a dress to grab some attention,or mabey clumsy Tohru getting more clumsy!You will find every thing in this charming book,it has romance, humor, and Kyo again...constantly trying to beat Yuki(""the damn rat""as Kyo calls him.)You will never forget the moments of this book!It will make you cry, laugh, cheer, and thrill.And all in one book!At the last chapter,Yuki is in a dress,Momiji is being tortured by Kyo,Momiji's got the looks(love)on Tohru.Never under estamate live,death,or...this lovely book!!!You should buy this if you want!But I recemend you buy this now if you want to have a wonderful time!"
1,Worst Than the First,"I have no idea how, but this was even worse than the first volume! Thirty pages into it I almost put it down, but I forced myself to finish it, and let me tell you, I'm sorry that I even picked it up. The writing is so atrocious I don't even know how anyone likes this. The characters are all annoying except for the cat, who's only fun because he's the only character that I don't feel like choking with a fork. Rather, I think he wants to choke everyone in this manga with a fork, which is the reason I like him.When I finished the first volume, I hated it. But I thought maybe it got better. Sometimes it only gets good after a few books. I had up to volume 6 on my to-read list. After this, I'm taking them all off. There is no way I can stomach more of this.The idea is fun, however, it's executed very badly. The whole hugging this is just stupid. What a dumb way for them to change. It would be sooooooo much cooler if they were just shape-shifters."
5,the bees knees as far as Arabic rhetoric goes,"There is only 2 books available on Arabic Rhetoric and this one is absolutely excellent. Well done, well set out and very comprehensive. Actually this book and the other one Amazon sell complement each other very well"
4,Jazz in Russian - Jan Johansson,"A unique CD incorporating several styles of contemporary Jazz. Soulful, moody tones are complemented lively 'swingy' numbers. This is all woven around memorable, 'Slavic Folk' tunes. Probably not for the purists, but definitely for anyone who loves a broader style of Jazz, folk and sensitive styles. A worthwhile addition to most music lovers' collection."
2,sorry jan,"having had a very long love of jan johansson's 'jazzz pa svenska' which i first heard in norway many years ago, i was really looking forward to this cd and it is with regret that i find myself unable to give it the high praise that i anticipated.johansson and riedel's 'svenska', with it's haunting and poignant interpretation of folk tunes was just perfect for acoustic bass and piano, and was justifiably successful in sweden and elsewhere.but 'ryska' just doesn't make the grade for me - too many instruments making too much noise, basically, and what the sudden blaring trumpet notes are about is beyond me. perhaps it is too much to expect another 'svenska', especially for me after all these years, but if you liked 'jazz pa svenska', don't say you were not warned."
1,Case of the slow replacement or perhaps no replacement,"The item was inoperative on arrival. On February 13, the seller gave me a return number and promised to send me a new tester. I immediately returned the item. On 3/5 I called to inquire and was told the item had been shipped; it had not. I made two more calls on 3/12 and 3/21; I am still waiting for the replacement."
1,An Embarassment,"This book is simply a trite advertisement for the Radical Right with as little relation to reality as the present administration's policies.Bush's cowardice, avoiding the draft, hiding on 9/11, and only taking on problems he can bulldoze his way through, is hidden behind flag-waving; something any veteran will tell you the president never earned the right to do. This book's only worth is to make Rush Libaugh's fans gush in blind adoration of a national embarassment."
1,ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING,"Well, here is yet another pathetic piece of Republican propaganda. I have to say I honestly do not know what I find more sickeining the fact that there actually a pathetic indivual alive such as the author who would actually dare to an paint unelected idiot such as George W. Bush as a leader or that there exists even more pathetic and illerate souls out there such as the past reviewers of this filth who actually believe him.As far as the author's ""insights"" into terrorism equally ignorant. George Bush is not at war with Bin Laden!!! Why would Shrub declare war on his best buddy. Wake up and smell the oil people!!! The Bush family has been in business with Bin Ladens for decades and the billions of taxpayer's money they gave the family throughout the years probably was the largest source of finance for the terrorist attacks."
1,"Even if you like his policies (I don't), forget this book","Dubya probably ghost wrote this book himself. Anyone with half a brain can see ""cover-up"" all over this self-serving tribute to his handling of the crisis of world terrorism."
1,Propaganda Puff Piece,"Our so-called ""president"" gets the puff piece treatment by a typer possibly a bit less illiterate than bush himself. In print form, the WHITE house can clean up and sanitize bush's (often filthy) language. But I personally miss the joy of a live presidential performance--especially the smirk bush gets on his face when he believes he's actually pronounced a big word (i.e. a word with more than 5 letters in it) correctly. At least we can share the comfort that he's a one term president."
1,what a joke,"i enjoy reading good comedy, and this one certainly fits the bill. the book is everything you'd expect...i think it's so interesting that, according to the stats on who is buying this, it's mostly right-wing hawks. but why would you spend time actually reading this and ann coulter? if you're so convinced you're right, why the need to keep driving it home? perhaps it's because when reading a book like this one by bill sammon, you realize that the book's subject, one g. bush, is a total lightweight. you honestly think he has a grasp of the military situation? the guy was never IN the military (yes, i know, he served in the texas air national guard...but read his record, he barely showed up...in fact, his attendence should have garnered him a court-martial). so please, buy this book if only to boost the economy. then you can use it to build a fire with as the winter approaches."
1,terrorism shmerrorism!,"Other countries have been fighting terrorism for years and years. We get one attack and we go to complete state control and a nationalistic us against the world fighting stance. This is all bullcrap. The war they are fighting is against the american people, they think that if they can just control them enough - everything will be okay. Remember, you'll be held for up to a year with no reason if you are a suspected terrorist - so watch how you talk on the phone and what you write in your emails!"
4,More than just the story of 9-11,"While it is true ""Fighting Back"" is an introspective look behind the scenes of George W. Bush's presidency during some of the darkest days of his administration, it also gives great insight into the way Democratic strategists have tried to undermine every breath he takes. Bush has been ""Fighting Back"" ever since Al Gore called him back on the cell phone election night and started trying to create votes that weren't there in his unsuccessful bid to steal the election from Bush.You should be sickened, when reading this, at the way these strategists twist the truth and try to politicize everything to their own gain. (as we saw recently at the Wellstone memorial when they turned it into a Democratic convention!)There is a whole chapter on the inner workings of James Carville et.al that was eye opening to this now former Democrat!"
3,"Some useful insights, but shallow overall","I'm generally a fan of Bill Sammon, but this is a surprisingly weak effort overall.Sammon does provide some fresh insights into Bush's thoughts and actions on the day of 9/11. As usual, his writing is crisp and engaging. But the book suffers from two major flaws. First, apart from his one interview with Bush, he apparently did no additional research. Almost all direct quotations are straight from White House press briefings. Second, the book too often devolves into a polemic on the media. It would not have been misleading to subtitle it ""One man's struggle against the liberal Washington press corps."" Sammon's criticisms may be factually accurate, but the endless score-settling becomes a tedious distraction in a book that's supposed to be about the *actual* war.For a relatively unbiased and extremely well-researched book on the same topic, I highly recommend Bob Woodward's ""Bush at War."""
4,Excellent Insights to the Bush White House,"I thought the book was terrific at detailing the inner workings of the Bush White House as well breaking down how the press and media work issues. There were times when I thought a chapter was a little redundant, but overall I felt pleased that the book offered affirmations of our political leaders."
3,Ok but doesn't deliver advertised wattage,"This unit is a good inverter as long as you don't expect it to live up to the claimed surge capacity. I have used it to run a small cabin that is off grid with a very large battery bank (675 amp hours, trojan t-105s). I also have a 3000 watt generator with a surge capacity of 3500 watts will run the cabin just fine, but is noisy so I don't like to use it. When this inverter is asked to surge to accommodate the demands of the well pump, the inverter goes into overload mode and shuts down. Running routine loads in the range of 500-1000 watts has not been a problem and the electronic lcd display of watts, battery voltage, and output voltage is nice. Just don't expect to get anywhere near 4000 watt surge capacity if that is what you really need. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,good characters but poor plot,"Blair S Walker writes entertainingly about various characters in Baltimore's black community. Apparently Don't Believe Your Lying Eyes is one of a series of Darryl Billups mysteries. It is the only one of the series I have read and, for me, it had problems. While the plot was fast moving if one looked it as describing a series of events, Mr. Walker never quite helped me understand what motivated his characters to do what they did. Darryl's house is torched and the tires of his car is slashed. We find out who did this but the reason for their actions was never clarified. Similarly I was at a loss to understand what motivated the shootings that began the mystery. In Don't Believe Your Lying Eyes all too often people do things but I never understood why. Yet the book is short, and if one doesn't delve deeply, it is a fast and OK read."
3,"enjoy the character, but not enough action.",NOT ENOUGH ACTION. READING WAS SLOW AND TETIOUS. NEEDS MORE CHARACTER DESCRIPTION. OTHERWISE OK FOR A QUICK READ. THANK YOU
2,Book is okay,The book was entertaining but there are many fiction books that are much better. Character development is week. I don't regret reading it but probably won't read others in this series.
4,The Last Episode,"I followed Darryl through his saga as a reporter and am now engrossed in his life. I like the realness of him, he's someone I could relate to. His side characters his sister and his best friend bring more richness to his character. Now I'm waiting for the next episode to see what new crime drama he can report on and what happens to him and the lady cop. A good series. Keep it coming!"
4,Lying Eyes,"Darryl Billups lastest assignment for the Baltimore Herald is to investigate the case of the female corpse found at Safe and Sound a storage facility. Darryl and his longtime live in girlfriend Yolanda breakup after a dinner filled with drama ather parents home. Discovering the corpse was murdered and missing for eighteen years. Darryl and the beautiful, smart newly promoted to detective Thelma Holmes solve the case. Great mystery with action and unexpected twists."
4,Another Great Band From NightMare Records!,At first glace I thought this album was just another Metal album with some progmetal touches. However once I sat down and gave it a good listen I found it was soo much more. The vocals are great and the vocal lines will catch you. The guitars have a great blend of hard core metal mixed with emotional melodic touches.My only problem at all with this album is the production qulity could be abit better. Don't get me wrong it's really not that bad. But if I had to find any issue at all it would be that. Still very good to listen to and a great album work picking up.I give it a four and a half out of five.
4,"Wamsutta 100% Cotton Luxury Gingham Flannel Full/Queen Duvet Cover, Maple","Really good quality for the price. Soft, nice looking and looks great in my son's room. I would have liked it to be a full size only so it would fit the comforter better."
4,great price for a decent duvet cover,"The quality of the cover is decent and will definitely keep you warm during those cold nights. It is a little hard at first, but a few washes will soften it up.Great bargain!"
2,Disappointed,"The condition of the book was not ""very good"" as the advertisement stated. Rather, the book is very worn and much of the front cover is bent."
3,Snore preventer,"My wife tried this because of her snoring. After about a month's worth of use the results were mixed. Some nights she definitely snored less, but there were others that seemed no better than before the treatment. Not sure why the variation, but in general it is better than before."
1,Worst book ever..,"Good that this book is out of print and not available. I know wby! The title says something, the book reads something. I can't believe the author was a journalist! I hope that the papers that he wrote for are still in business. The book completely lacks focus, switches on topics without any relevance, improper use of abbreviations, without even reader knowing what it means! Don't waste your time and money"
5,"book review, books about teaching art to kids",This book is lively and fun with great illustrations and wonderful rhyming words. I purchased it to help teach elementary school children about two of the elements of art: line and shape. It did the job very well and has so many examples in the course of the poetry that it is one of the books you can easily read over and over.
3,A book for tourists to Buddhism,"Pretty pictures and words, but not much here for the serious Buddhist. The calendar represents only a narrow section of the various Buddhist sects, and worse, is unclear. If you like to meditate on Buddhist art, this is a nice book. If you want a book to give your mother who doesn't understand why you are a Buddhist, this is a nice book. Just don't expect a serious treatment of the Buddhist year."
3,serves its purpose,the item serves its purpose.i use it on my recliner.it is very hard and i need to put a cusion on top.not very comfortable siting.
5,"Practical, Practical and Practical","My copy of this portable little reference is dog-eared, worn and well used. It contains practical information written by practical people and is a practical size (15cm x 11cm) for those of us continually on the move.A good little tool."
4,Installed fixture two months ago,This replacement unit functions fine.Meaningless words to reach 20-word review minimum a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a aq a
4,Easy installation & set-up,"Extremely easy to install and setup. For the price paid, quality is good.Lantern was used to replace an existing fixture that had been installed without the benefit of an electrical box. This required some careful arranging of the wires and wire nuts as much of the space in the lantern base is taken up by the lamps electronics box."
4,Decent book for the money.,"I liked this book and it has a lot of good information in it. However, I was expecting it to be more like a traditional planner with more space for an actual schedule. It does have space for some scheduling but it is more of a pocket guide to nursing and has some really good tips for nurses. I would buy the book again."
5,Essential for a nursing student that needs organization!,This planner is perfect- it has two styles of calendars so you can choose which one (monthly or daily/by week) and has a quick reference for all your needs. kind of bulky but it is one book instead of 2 or 3...
5,No One Can Do What They Did!!!,"Stranger By Day has been through a ton of s@#%. Not many people know that because you're either into to corporate rock or too busy conforming. These guys played their last show with the former lead singer, Josh, Feb. 13,2004. That was the greatest night of my life. I was afraid of what might happen with the new CD, but I kept positive about it. I heard the demos they released to hxcmp3.com and they were nice. But then there was an even better recording a little later on in life. This album is by far the greatest thing a band could have released after going off track for awhile. his is by far one of the best bands from GA. If you are ever here make sure to check and see if they are at swayze's venue. You will not be sorry if you buy this CD."
5,"The best Civil War & Gettysburg book, I''ve ever read.","This is a reorder of great book read long ago.. It chronicles the history of a group of Maine shopkeepers, farmers and tradesmen from their induction to the hilltop fight in a pivotal battle that likely saved the union at Gettysburg. Joshua Chamberlin, Ellis Spear, Walter Morrill and a ""middle aged"" lumberman enlistee whose beard and hair grew amazingly grey in an amazingly short time make up the cast of well described characters. If I had to recommend the one book that tells the real story about the real people who fought the Civil War, this would be it . It is well written, very readable and essential on every Civil war bookshelf. To be honest, I would't be buying this one if the person who borrowed my copy hadn't liked it too much to return!"
4,Very Good.,"A regimental history that really reflects the combat history of the Army of the Potomac from Antietam to Appomattox, this piece of Civil War literature is well worth your time.Pullen puts you in the action so effectively that you really begin to wonder how regiments like the Twentieth Maine were able to perform so heroically for so long. Credited with single handedly saving the Union flank the second day at Gettysburg, the 20th Maine produces one of the finest battle field commanders of the war: Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.With a combat record second to none, these boys from Maine just may have saved the Union. It is because of their efforts that the United States owes such a deep sense of gratitude to the entire State of Maine."
4,"Hello, music press, where are you?","Babe is simply the best unknown band I know of. They're not writing hooks for the radio, just real songs about what a scam the state lotteries are, how strip malls, TGI Fridays, and Ground Round are destroying individuality, and a bunch of other topics rock and rap are too self-absorbed to deal with. They range from crunchy, thumping beats to the softest, sweetest melodies. If you can, see them live, although that's easier the closer you get to NYC. Babe the Blue Ox deserves your money and attention."
5,Danney Rocks !,Earthquakes in California don't Rock half as much as You! Keep it comming! (I love Vivaldi's Spring!)
4,Decent artists/Great Era,"I think the artists and songs chosen for this Cd are nice and recognizable. I do appreciate a more obsure taste from time to time though. To see the Cure, Ministry, or even Nine Inch Nails on an 80's mix would be nice and not so poppy."
4,Big Bowl,This bowl has a nice rim so it's easy to toss and serve salad. The wood appears to be of high quality and so far it is an easy care serving piece. I would recommend it to others.
2,Don't Bother,"They recommended you get your same shoe size, but I didn't believe them and ordered a half size larger. However, even a half size larger was too small. This shoe kind of gapes open and the toggle shoe string sticks up and just looks really weird. It looked really cute in the picture and I was really glad to finally have found a white zumba shoe. But, this isn't the one. I'll keep looking."
1,Batting Crap,"This is one of the worst most boring books I've ever read on the sport. Why are two lazy dimwitted canadians writing a book on our national pastime.Stick with hockey, maybe you'd do better at writing a book about that.Joshua GoldsteinHanover, NH"
4,Cannot put them down,"All of the Ramses series of books I have found to be a super read. They provide an educated insight into the lives of Egyptian people in the past plus have good plots, intrigue and character building in a very straightforward way. I have now finished the series and am missing them very much!"
5,Wonderful series to read!,I absolutely love this series of books and can't wait to read more from this author. The books are so well written.
5,great series,"Could not be more pleased. This series has murder, love, adventure, mystery and more. Highly addictive for any one who has imagination."
5,Excellent!,"I think this set of fiction ts really great! The story is interesting and attractive. But i think the vocabulary is quite difficult for student, especially those under 15 years old. Finally, I highly recommend this book to all of you!"
2,A publishing rip off!!,"I have now read all 5 of the series. They are OK. Not great, since they read like a child's book. Large print, and few words per page has meant that the publisher could stretch this to 5 volumes. $70 plus, is really a bit excessive for a relatively unsatisfying read."
3,It is a kind of chotic site of the life,"As my passed away father told me that; I guess it was on the fifth book of these Ramses series, they were eaten yogurth in ancient Egypt times, but yogurth's history depends Turkish society not the Arabian one. That's why he told me that , there is a logic mistake , in these times there should not have been yogurth in old Egypt. And I promised my Dad that I am going to write it to Christian Jacq but how to do I really do not know, that's why I would like to share with you. If you know how to reach Mr.Jacq please let me know. Thanks"
4,The Knights Templar: A New History,"I would endorse this book to anyone who wishes to the facts about the Knights Templar without having to wade through a lot of foggy mysticism and conspiracy theory. It gives a much truer picture of what the Templars were, what made them tick, and what life was like for them. So I believe, anyway, having researched the Order for some years myself.The author is a worthy historian and a leading expert in the field. It is quite right that she based her conclusion on the evidence, rather than what she thought would make a good story and wild speculation. She also covers some interesting and hiterto neglected aspects of the Order of the Temple's history, such as its presence in Eastern Europe where they encountered the invading Mongols. It is engagingly written, for the most part, not too long, and does not go into excessively great detail.There are, additionally, many great photographs of Templar buildings from throughout Europe and the Middle East."
5,Hammers of God,"This is a great book. I would recommend any book by this historian as worth the purchase and read. Team her works up with ones from Napier, Dafoe, Nicholle, and you have a winning set of volumes.Wonderful!"
3,templars no mystery and no charms,"This book is strictly based on historical sources. However, the history of the templars results to be more less charming and mysterious as ever. Nicholson cancels all doubts but all beautiful elements of the texture as well. Her historical method is too rationalistic, and it doesn't give room to mystical or philosophical hypoteses. There are only some hints at baphomet and at the so-called ""islamic"" components of the tenets of Templars. Even though it is well documented, it represents a very harsh or arid reading."
4,Dan Peek An American Band,"A good read,interesting and personal account of Dan`s time in America.It`s all Dan`s writing with no other ""quotes"" etc by other people (unlike the great David Crosby book).Dan writes about early years before the band,meeting and forming America and then their ride through the 70`s...pretty informative with some good memories.I liked Dan`s writing but overall thought i was missing something from the story?Sort of could`nt get the full picture,and thats probably because it`s all Dan`s story...Overall worthwhile as you learn quite a bit about the band and about Dan himself,a great musician and person.And i cant believe how good this band was."
2,Trio or Duo? It doesn't matter...,"As someone who espouses the ""christian way of life"" it seems rather sad that the facts according to Peek have to be dredged up again. What's passed is past. The fact that there seems to be more unresolved issues make me think that he should have talked to the two men in the crux of the matter instead of letting them READ it in a book. WOW. Anyway, glad he's ""forgiven"" them and himself. That's always a good thing. As for the book, it's ok. It's a kind of salicious read for those longing for the glory days from the mid to late '70's. If you read the portions of it on the website it might be a way to save the $13."
3,A trip back to my teens.,Reading through this book transported back to where I grew up in southern california and some similar adventures. I enjoyed reading about Dan's early years moving around with his family and how he and his brother Tom got into music. I liked Dan's honesty about his faith in GOD and what it means to him.
4,Comprehensive description,"This book is not just covering product development process for food industry, but also could be used as a general framework to understand other industries as well. A number of good figures and diagrams to illustrate the process flow."
3,a regency fan,"I loved the first half and I only liked the second half.Beau was THE original early 19th century dandy who started modern trends in men's fashions. Well...they always say one good looking guy is ""worse"" than 10 good-looking girls, when it comes to standing in front of the mirror.I liked the name-dropping and the feeling of Regency splendor in the first half of the book. After Beau was frozen out of Regency England due to bad debts and he went to live in France, the story takes a down-turn. It does not have the happy ending I would have wished for Beau."
1,Never Received My Item!!!!!,"I ordered this item on March 30, paid for it but have never received it. The seller will not respond to my emails. What's up with this company since I see this has happened to others?"
1,Disappointed!!!!,"I ordered this item to ship to a friend's daughter before I was to travel to spend a week with them. I ordered it in plenty of time (in fact, an item I ordered from a different reseller for their son showed up early). I not only didn't receive a shipping date from this reseller and they passed the estimated delivery date without communication, but I sent them an email more than a week ago, asking for further details. I received no response. I just sent them an email, asking to cancel my order.Obviously, I won't order from this reseller again."
3,A Fascinating Story!,"In Something Upstairs, Caleb and Kenny have been going through many things in each chapter. Anxiously, they have met some strange and unusual characters. This book was mostly about a young boy who woke up in the middle of the night and found a hand reaching to a bookcase in his attic room. Although they've gotten into disagreements, Kenny and Caleb always find better ways to get through them. They've also had breakthroughs. Throughout the story, they have gauged each other and scrutinized one another to see if they could trust each other. These two characters go a long way from starting point to ending point, together.I would recommend this book to preteens and older because it shows some difficult vocabulary and scary parts. Another reason is when you read it, you're so anxious to get to the next part you can't even wait."
4,The Review of Somethings Upstairs,"This book has action and mystery. I recommend this book to 5th graders. About 10 year olds should read this. This book is easy to read. From my expirence, 5th graders like mysteries. In this book Kenny, a boy, and Caleb, a dead slave, have to find Calebs murderer. Or else Caleb will be trapped as a dead slave forever. With that, there is tons of action between the characters while the book is going. It is a mystery because they have to guess on who the killer is. If they are right they have to kill him/her. Then kenny will go back to his world and Caleb will be free."
2,Mysterious Story,"A kid named Kenny moved into a new house in Providence. One night he realized something was emerging out of the floor. After a couple of days he was anxious to find out what it was. Kenny went to the library and talked to a man named Mr. Willinghast, but when Kenny told him the story Willinghast scrutinized him. When Kenny found out what that thing was, he was dumbfounded. Kenny found out it was a fancy which was a slave way back in time. He went back in time to find the fancy's killer.I recommend this book if you're going to read it with your class because you wouldn't understand some things and you would like to hear it aloud. The vocabulary is challenging."
5,Great book,My daughter really enjoyed this book. It arrived in a timely fashion and was in great condition. I would highly recommend!!
4,Something Upstairs,I think that this was a good book although there was some scenes that I didn't get and wern't very exciting either but I did like the parts that had a choice to make or a part where something happened to a character.One of the choices was kill a friend or become a ghost and I really liked those of course you could always guess what would happen but it is how they turn out like it is always solved but in a complex way and so I enjoyed this book.
5,Something Upstairs,"If you like mystery and excitment in a book Something Upstairs is right for you! It is about a boy named Kenny and a ghost named Caleb.Kenny used to live in California, but then moved to Rhode Island with his family.The house they move into is very old and creepy.Kenny gets his room in the attic.In the attic there are two secret rooms in the wall.The first night Kenny heard strange sounds coming from the rooms.Kenny gets out of bed and goes into the room and finds a ghost coming out of the floor.After several meetings with him Kenny finds out that his name is Caleb.Caleb was murdered in the first room.Kenny was intrested in Caleb and went to the historical library and finds an article in a newspaper.He finds out that Caleb wasn't murdered, it said that Caleb locked himself in and commited suicide.But according to Caleb it was a lie.Want to find out what happen?Check out the book.....you won't be dissapointed."
5,Something Upstairs by Avi,"Memories and unfound answers brought Caleb, a ghost of a boy slave back into the present for help. Looking back into the past and finding the truth of this mysterious murder of a slave boy, Caleb. Kenny, the new boy who moved into the house is on a mission to travel back into the past and help find the murderer who killed Caleb, so Caleb could be freed from the house and from the present world. Read and find out more in depth about what happens. Once you start reading it, it'll take you as long as it needs to finish without stopping. So sit back and enjoy this book."
4,Great cookbook but a little preachy,This is a wonderful cookbook. I have used many of the recipes multiple times. When I first got it I read all the comments and liked it but after a while they get annoying. If you use the same recipe frequently you can't help but feel 'preached at' after a while.
1,This was a big disappointment.,After wearing a pair of these socks only five times I had two holes develop. Why gold toe refuses to supply it's customers with the gold toe mid calf fluffies in all colors is beyond me. The gold toe fluffies are much better butyou can only get the midcalf in black. They need to do something about this. I really deserve a refund on these socks.
2,One size does NOT fit all.,"I wear a size 11 sock and these are way too big for me. I pity the poor soul who wears an 8, 9, or 10 (or less) who is stuck with this product. Probably would feel more like leotards than over-the-cuff socks.Amazon.com suggests that I tell to whom I would recommend this product. Perhaps an NBA center?"
2,way too long,"If you like to wear your socks to your knee, then you may like this sock. Not sure why it is so long."
2,Great dress and everyday socks,Very nice. With hand washing they will last 10 years or more. And a very attractive price for this quality
2,not so sure,not so sure on these socks. have always purchase gold toe for my husband but these came out of the laundry looking a hundred years old.
5,great buy,"these are very, very long socks. I am almost 6 foot tall and they still came up to my knee. They are partly wool and feel good if you like that kind of texture. The top is so tight I have to work them on and off. but it think they are a very good quality and am glad i got them."
3,Longer than they look,"Nicely made, if a bit thin compared to the Gold Toe socks I remember. Overpriced. And very, very, very long. Which may be good, if you're into that sort of thing."
5,Wool Socks,"These socks are wonderful. My husband suffered from severe athlete's foot. He needed socks that would keep his feet completely dry and these socks do the job. In cold weather they keep his feet warm, but in any weather they wick all the moisture away from his feet. The only problem is that my sons keep borrowing them and I have to buy more. They are also very nice-looking with dress clothes, and they do not bag or fall down."
4,"Good socks, but a bit thin","These are decent, comfortable socks. However, they are on the thin side. I have not had a chance to wear them in extremely cold weather (<20 F), but so far, they have served me fine."
2,One size doesn't fit all,"If you have a shoe size between 9 and 11, these socks should fit you fine. They do an excellent job staying up and are good quality.On the other hand, if you have feet larger than approximately 11, I would beware. Though the company says these socks have a foot size range from 6 to 12.5, after six months of laundering the heel is pretty much under the arch of my size 13 foot. I thought I'd be alright and the socks are not even close."
3,This socks have changed,"This is the third time I have purchased this brand/style of sock from Amazon, and this time the socks are much more sheer than before. I saved the old packaging and the previous wool content was 54% the socks just delivered are 56% wool. The real change is the thickness of the product. The new product is much more sheer. Don't know If I will keep them or not,. The description of these socks on the web site shows the old fabric content."
5,Love These,I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He loves them and I am placing an order for some more today.
3,Its an OK read,"I thought this book was OK (hints my review title). The book was really slow in the beginning and the actual book didn't start until like three forths the way through. Ya, Joan Lowery Nixon REALLY introduced you to the characters in this book, that got pretty boring! But the last 30 pages of the book were pretty interesting because stuff was actually happening. This book would be good for a reader that likes to find out who the bad guy is on the last page of the book because that is practically what Nixon did in the book. So overall this book wasn't wasting my time but I could have gone without reading it."
5,WOW! Book,This book is the right one for you if you like good thrillers. Joan Lowery Nixon writes wonderful mysteries and the Orphan Train Riders for younger kids. She uses very descriptive words and reading her work helps you with your own writing. I strongly reccomend this book to anyone who loves books which you can't put down.
3,very good,"this book was good, but it could be better. in the middle of the book it got very dull and boring, but the end made up for that. i would recomend this book to readers that like mystery books."
4,It was alright,"This book is about a small town Texan girl named Jess Donnelly who thinks that things will get better at school when two cute new guys show up. But something's strange - she doesn't know their real names, or if they can be trusted. But then she realizes that their names are surely fake. She thinks that Mark is the good guy and Scott is the bad guy. Read the book to find out what happens in the end. I would recommend this book to people who like mysteries or suspense."
2,AT YOUR SERVICE,"I KEEP READING THE BOOKS ALSO AND I AM TOTALY DISSAPPOINTED TRYING TO GET UP WITH ONE THAT CATCHES MY IMAGINATION. NOTHING.AND THE AUTHORS ARE GREAT BUT THESE STORIES [stink].RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT THEM, TRYING TO FORGET THEM.THE GLORY OF LOVE,TOP SECRET,COURAGE UNDER FIRE (NOT SO BAD)BUT STILL A HARD READ."
3,After the games are played.,"In BET's special Summer 2003 'At Your Service' series, Kim Louise brings us the story of Navy Seal, Commander Haughton Storm.The one thing that could have dissuaded Storm from becoming a Navy Seal was Roxanne Allgood. She is the girl he introduced to womanhood and the woman who captured his heart. But Storm broke Roxanne's heart and she left him. After the bitter break up Roxanne channeled all of her energies into becoming a pilot and Storm enlisted in the Navy. Although they still think of each other they have not spoken in ten years.THE GLORY OF LOVE matches the power of love against a dangerous video game and readers will enjoy the battle of wits as Storm and Roxy try desperately to capture the ring. Video games are taken to another level.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ ReviewersComplete review can be found on our website..."
2,"At Your Service Book 3... finally, a plot!","I keep reading the At Your Service miniseries hoping they'll get better. But the first was so bad that anything would be better. At least The Glory of Love had a somewhat interesting action plot, though it wasn't expanded on nearly as much as it could (and should) have. Haughton Storm and Roxanne Allgood have a past... relayed clumsily in disjointed flashbacks. I never got close to these characters. The entire resolution of the book was rushed, wrapping up threads in the romance and action plots hurriedly. This miniseries is supposed to have some continuity between the books-- the heroes all attended Buckley Academy, a military school, either high school or college (which one has yet to be made clear). In either case, Louise has some plotholes with her flashbacks."
1,Very dissapointed,"My Father gave me a bottel over a year ago, it realy seamed to help me. I looked around and couldn't find any localy so I went to Amazon.com and there it was. I placed my order with a dilivery date of Feb 14, 2013. Never got it. I love the product but never receved it. It's now Feb 28 and no product. I sent an e-mail though Amazon to the vender but still no product! I want the product or my money back!Stan"
3,"I love ""Cardinal Directions""","I bought this CD after hearing ""Cardinal Directions"". I was a little disappointed, since Cardinal Directions is a different kind of song from the rest of the tracks. It's not that any of the other songs are bad. They just aren't what I was after. Cardinal Directions is infectious. I can't just play it once. I have to play it over and over."
3,"I tried the YSNORE Anti-Snoring Nose Drops, and ...","I tried the YSNORE Anti-Snoring Nose Drops, and wasn't really impressed with the fact that it was drops. It was a little messy. I think a better idea would be a spray. It seemed to work well enough though. I asked my family if I snored less and they said that there was a little improvement. I guess my recommendation would be that if your snoring, or that of a loved one, is causing problems, anything is worth a try. Who knows? It may work better for some than others."
3,YSNORE Anti-Snoring Nose Drops must be a really ...,"YSNORE Anti-Snoring Nose Drops must be a really new product on the market. The ingredients in the product are okay. But I think they need to work on it and improve it, because I didn't see any results. The idea in general is very nice."
5,Quality item,Nice connector. Good for cleaning the look of a wall plate connection by keeping the coax from sticking straight out.
5,Great Product,"Great and helpful piece of equipment. Bought it a little more than a year ago and it is still working strong. This is a late review, but if it's still working, then a review by this time is more helpful than an early one. Get your shop on!!"
4,Brutally Honest,Recovery take brutal honsety. This gentle path through the step leaves no stone unturned. If you really want to uncover the wreckage of addiction this is the book for it.http://www.daybreakservices.com
3,Great book excelent read,"This is indeed the best book about addictions that I've read (imo). The only thing is that I buy it used, but never expected in so bad conditions."
2,"Admirable attempt, but more confusing than clarifying","I believe I understand what the author was trying to get at in writing this book...and the title suggets it, a way thru the work of the 12 steps that is not as stringent or hard core.Alas, the results are a muddled and poor written effort. Just go to the first few pages of Step One (which you can read in the preview). All the imagery and allegory to fictional literature immedately obscures the message.Of course, some will find help in this book....but you may want to try other books before giving this one a shot."
3,Large unremovable sticker on book,"The book itself was in great shape upon arrival, quite unblemished with no writing or highlighting inside, as was advertised. However, the book had a huge hot pink sticker across the spine from front to back that could not be peeled off. That fact was not listed in the book description, which is not proper."
3,Stronger for Addicts than Co-Addicts?,"Patrick Carnes has been a grounder-breaker in every sense concerning sexual addiction. I feel ambivalent about this offering, however. I think on the whole it's a stronger book for addicts than for codependents. The material seems to revolve around addiction with co-addiction serving as an afterthought, both figuratively and literally. As a recovering codependent, I yearn for materials that address my issues head-on instead of relating me to the addicts in my life. Something about this material makes me feel second-class and doesn't inspire me to go as deeply as I could.Although it's on order and I can't review it yet, I suggest that codependents take a look at Pia Mellody's 12 step workbook, Breaking Free, as an alternative. Her Facing Codependence contains some extraordinarily muscular, clear-sighted work on codependence as an illness that stands on its own, and if the workbook has anything in common, it should prove useful."
5,geltle path -,God is good... the 12 steps are important for anyone wanting to remain clean and sober.. can't live without them - a good book tohave to help walk that pathway of recovery.
4,Great Product!,Great Product. Really helpful for someone who is new to recovery and not sure where to start. Really helps with working the steps.
1,"Pet a kitten, but these are not the 12 Steps","This book may be helpful to some people but it is not the 12 Steps and I don't believe one can say after using this book that they have done the steps of any 12 Step program. If you want to understand the 12 Steps pick up the AA Big Book. The Gentle Path can be supplemental, but it is no where near a decent understanding of the steps. Sorry, but this is the truth."
4,Readin,"Book came in perfect and I am finding it very useful. Glad that I ordered the book, great choice for sure."
2,Outdated!,"It's a shame that the kindle edition is the 1994 one, I have the paperback 2012 which is really updated and expanded, I hope you update the kindle one to match the latest printed edition"
4,very through,a little redundant at times but the book is really helpful with delving into some of the deep rooted stuff
1,Not what I was hoping for...,"These were alright headphones but they didn't work for me at all. I just got a Helio Hero which is a phone and a mp3 player so i wanted a nice pair of headphones that would also act as a headset. But the headset jack was only mono and I didn't like the idea of swithching back and forth between jacks, plus i didn't really like that there were two jacks so that one was always dangling and I didn't like the big ol' honking remote in the middle. These simply weren't designed with my purposes in mind. The other model, the ones designed for the Treo, was closer to what I wanted but those didn't work with my phone."
2,music,"this was guitar player reccomended to me by a friend who said i should listen to the players style, i was quiet impressed."
2,Aegean Cotton Greek Fisherman Cap Black/7,"Cheaply designed and does not fit to size, in that it is smaller than all the ""medium"" size caps I currently have in my arsenal of numerous caps and hats. I really don't like wasting time sending back smaller items, it's just not worth the hassle and shipping cost,so I kept this cap.Maybe I can give it to someone that wear a size small."
1,Illusion,"DO NOT BUY! This product is not as it appears. In the picture it seems to be very sturdy, but it is very flimsy and cheap. The front top of the hat looks like it stays in place, but it is a soft piece of cloth that does not stay in place when you put it on your head. It is said to be a genuine Greek Fisherman's Hat, but I seriously doubt it, I could have made a better hat myself and saved my money. This purchase was a complete waste of money, absolutely pathetic."
2,buy the wool one,Came in the wrong size and wool is so much better then the aegean cotton.Although it seemed well made I could not get passed the cotton.I was also so dissapointed about getting the wrong size I did not try again.It is so sad that I can not find this hat type locally.
3,Font size,"I gave the book as a gift and was disappointed when I got a glimpse of the print on the page ... it was very small (to save cost of printing?) and did not look like it would be easy to read....however, I did not read the book so I will have to talk to the giftee to find that info"
4,That's How the Ball Bounces,"In watching a basketball game, have you ever watched the trajectory of a basketball as it hits the rim or backboard or why some shots result in ""nothing but net"" or why good shooters put more arch on their shots? This book explains the physics involved in shooting and ball-rim-backboard interaction. The author goes into some depth on these subjects to give the reader a good appreciation for the forces involved. The author makes good use of humor combined with his own playing experience."
2,disappointing,"Fans of ""The Little Death"" and ""Laughing Gallery"" BEWARE. Ruth Ruth have gone into an entirely different direction with this new album. This album reeks of a once rockin punk band desperately seeking radio play. Perhaps this has something to do with thier new label, RCA. Anyway, the album itself isnt so bad after a couple listens, in fact songs like ""Cadillac Michigan"" are very good. But for anyone looking for a sequel to ""Little Death"", you wont find it here.Too bad."
1,WHAT HAPPENED???,"Gone are the days of Dead Boys/Dictators fueled punk rock. Ruth Ruth have gone alternative, whatever that is.Their debut album,Laughing Gallery,was perfect. Listening to this is like listening to Kiss' Unmasked instead of Alive! It hurts me to write this,really..."
3,Childrens book,"The book has a very nice overview of Fibonnaci in daily life, written for children age 10 - up."
3,Do Your Homework,"I had been planning to purchase this intake for my '04 Jeep Wrangler. The ""Does this part fit"" function is flawed. My trim type is SE, which implies that my engine is the 2.4L 4-cylinder. This claims to fit the SE trim style. According to Airaid's web site it does not. If you want an Airaid product I would use their site to find out what product is right for your vehicle/engine. I'm giving this 3 stars because of bad product information. I can not speak to the quality of Airaid's product on way or another."
4,Good Art Projects,"This was a gift for a friend of mine and she says it keeps her little one busy. The instructions could be a little more detailed, but its still easy to figure out."
3,Not what I hoped for.,"Over priced for what you get. More cardboard animals would be nice,but the product was very cute and entertaining."
2,Buy a different Alex set!!!,"This set is sooo disappointing! I love the other Alex kits, specifically the bug set and sea critters lacing set. This one just stinks!First of all, the different animals are not divided into kits, and no instructions are provided. So you get a box of a lot of pieces of random colored paper, tissues, googly eyes, stickers, feathers, pipe cleaners, etc, but no clue on how to use them. You end up with a small child grabbing at everything and making a random critter with a huge mess.The other Alex kits that divide into separate sections are much better for a busy mom. Also, note that once this box is opened, there's no way to organize it all.The stickers in it are like superglue, there's no way to reposition them if the kids stick them to the wrong spot, which is sort of likely for this age, so things just go wrong once you open the box."
3,"all-full length, unbeat mixed versions, but very commercial","This one is good for collectors of dance mixes, and all mixes are the long versions, but not many of these mixes actually stand out. Instead of using the 10 minute Junior Vasquez Sound Factory mix of Paula Abdul, we get the softer, more commercial sounding 8 minute Vasquez Club mix. It's cool to have the almighty mix of Deborah Harry and a house mix of Shaggy--and there are some remixes of older songs from Kim Carnes, Duran Duran, Belinda Carlisle and Spandau Ballet, none of which is all that impressive and just adds to the commercial appeal of this collection, rather than giving us some truly rare big club tracks of the 90s--that were actually recorded in the 90s."
2,Pass on this book,This book describes the types of illnesses that are the result of metabolic imbalances that can be rectified or improved with amino acid supplements. Unfortunately the author does not suggest how much or how often such supplements should be taken. Other topics/features I had hoped to find in this book include more discussion on the non-essential amino acids and an index.Amino acids can definitely help one improve their health. However I recommend you continue looking for alternative books.
4,Good but not great...,"This book gives a good yet somewhat simplistic overview of using amino acids to improve your health. What you won't get is an in-depth technical discussion of each of the individual amino acids. What you will get are some useful recommendations for which amino to take for certain conditions (ie. stress, depression, allergies, weight loss, etc.) I like the fact that the author tells us which aminos to take together and with which vitamin/mineral cofactors. Combining this book with ""Amino Acids In Therapy"" by Leon Chaitow, D.O. would be a pretty good way to start learning about the potential health benefits of proper amino acid supplementation. Unfortunately, both of these books are getting a little long in the tooth. A lot has been discovered since they were written over 15 years ago. I'm still waiting for the definitive amino acid book."
4,amino revolution,"it is written very simply, bit to the point. if you are looking for an introduction on amino acids, this is the one!"
3,"Not bad, but leaves too much to the imagination.","Joyce's writing style is in fact similar to Neil Gaimen's (which honestly, is why I picked up Indigo in the first place). His characters have some heavily blunt yet bizarre personality traits, which makes the book a fun read in general. The problems come with the vivid descriptions used to explain the effects of the supernatural elements of the story. The plot is nicely created and developed, but I finished Indigo with no idea what the ""wolf"" reference was supposed to be applied to, and a big hole where a much needed wrap-up of events could have been inserted. This is Joyce's first attempt at a thriller. While I've heard wonderous things about his previous works,which are more of a dark fantasy theme, I wouldn't say they apply here. Not bad, not boring, but not a thouroughly completed book in my eyes."
3,Entertaining But Not His Best,"While not his best work, Indigo by Graham Joyce was a thrilling read. He claims that this is his first thriller but I think its easy to argue that most of his previous works have had equal amounts of ""thrill"" to them. What Joyce does so well is quickly set up an intriguing situation with captivating characters. He accomplishes in one chapter what most authors would do in several.While the ending seems a little rushed and lacks some of the resolution I would have liked to see, the book is entertaining. Its easy to see why he's earned the respect of the British writing community and been able to nab so many awards. I'd be more apt to recommend Dreamside or Tooth Fairy before Indigo but this is a satisfying read."
1,"One dull, boring, draggy, and pointless piece of writing.","This is the third book of Mr. Joyce's that I've read and is quite unlike the first two. I thought the first two (Requiem and Dark Sister) were very well done. Indigo never quite goes anywhere. It drags like few books I've ever read. The book deals with Jack Chamber's attempts, as executor, to resolve his estranged and eccentric father's unusual will. Interesting story line on the surface, but a dull, boring, aimless and draggy implementation by Mr. Joyce. My sincere recommendation: Be kind to yourself, read something else!"
1,A Huge Letdown,"I'm a big fan of Joyce. Tooth Fairy, Dark Sister and Requiem were all unique and engrossing reads, which makes Indigo all the more disappointing. I couldn't empathize with any of the characters and the pseudo-scientific concept of Indigo lost its appeal quickly. Pass on this one and read Tooth Fairy."
2,Disappointment...,"IndigoGraham JoyceMain Character: Jack ChambersWell, it's only been about a month since I read this book and unfortunately I can't say that anything memorable from this book has stayed with me. The first half is, in my opinion, overly complicated and the second half is just plain weird. It's only my habit of going all the way through with everything that kept me from putting this book down before finishing it. A very chaotic piece of work."
2,Is this the guy that wrote Tooth Fairy?,"This book was such a dissapointment. I knew it wasn't Joyce's best, but after reading The Tooth Fairy, which was one of the better books I've read in a long time, I thought that his not-best will still be a very good book.Indigo has got a very lame idea and carton-like characters. But it could have still worked, if the writing was worth anything.I have no idea how I survived it and read it through.Stay away - don't let it burn a bad impression of Joyce in your memory."
3,"Talented Writer, So-so Book","I must say that I would not hesitate one second to pick up another one of Graham Joyce's novels. This one had me clinging to every word and eager to read the next chapter.The story of an English ex-Bobby, who travels to Chicago upon hearing the news of his eccentric, estranged father's death, and gets a mystery thrust upon him which leads him to Rome along with his half-sister to whom he is uncomfortably attracted to. Our main character also must publish his father's manuscript regarding the elusive colour, Indigo and on attaining invisiblility.While the writing is superb and the story moved along at a perfect pace, it was the ending that absoutely caused the story to fizzle. After such an extraordianry buildup, I must echo what other reviewers have said-- the ending just did not work.Still, I would reccomend this book to fans of mystery and sciFi as it is very well written and the story is clever for the most part."
3,Flawed but smooth,"In this vaguely postmodern novel, the layer of the text itself is smooth; transitions work, dialogue is believable enough, and objects and scenes are well described. Similarly characters are well designed, even if not all of their actions seem to be based in reality. And the set up of the plot is at its origin great - a mysterious cult, a mysterious personality, and two very likable characters work through it. However, the weirdness becomes compound to the point where not every thread is resolved, making me think this author got tired or interrupted on the way to finishing this work. As a result, it's a good B novel and an easy, engrossing read, but nothing to pursue for knowledge per se. Then again, if you wanted that, you'd be reading Nabokov or Pynchon anyway, right?"
4,"New,tasteful and seamless","Joyce, does a great job of keeping the story moving at a fast pace and creates characters that are both deep and easily recognized in everyday life. The book has almost everything,although the ending needed a bit more, it is a very difficult not to want to finish this book in one sitting(I was forced to do it in two). The suspense level builds along with the plot but declines in the end. Worth reading just for the fun of it. Fresh ideas and characters and a clever style of writing make this book one to buy."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK-IT'S OLD,"I queried several of the agencies and companies listed in this book, and guess what? The post office returned many of the letters because the addresses were either wrong, outdated, or the recipient was no longer there. AMAZON SHOULD TAKE THIS BOOK OFF THE SITE; IT IS A RIP-OFF!"
2,I was quite underwhelmed by this book,"Perhaps if you knew nothing about Hollywood and screenwriting, this book might help you a little. I've taken several classes and written four scripts, and I found all of the information extremely basic and below the level need for someone ready to break into the business. I thought it would be helpful with all the agent listings, but they mostly tell you to contact the agency for submission policies anyway, which is really no help at all, making it an expensive telephone book. I also think the book could have been cut back on some - the ""war stories"" are nothing new and really aren't helpful at all. The stuff about LA really belongs in a guidebook and not in a screenwriting book; that just seemed like a lot of padding."
1,This book was a big disappointment,"It's big and thick and looks like it might have a lot of information, until you put it to use and find out it's so cluttered with errors. Many of the people I contacted as a result of this book were miffed, having been listed without consultation. I checked the author's screenwriting credits and found he had none. Perhaps next time he should learn a little more about the profession before he writes a how-to book about it. A big thumbs down from me."
4,Informative & Practical Advice for the Novice Screenwriter,"I found the book to be insightful and honest. While it is probably not for the established, professional screenwriter, it does give good advice for those just starting out. I must say that I've found Skip Press' book to be helpful"
1,I agree -- this book is next to worthless,"I am a story analyst for a major lit agency and, as part of my job, read and evaluate all of the new screenwriting books that come to market. I must say this is just about the worst book for the screenwriter that has come along in quite some time. It totally misrepresents how one needs to go about breaking into the business as a screenwriter. A lot of the suggestions it contains would be, in fact, detrimental for the emerging screenwriter. The author's lack of credits and lack of real-world experience as a screenwriter is woefully obvious in the bad advice that fills this book. Anyone who tries to use it will find it a guide to misfortune. Too many people are writing screenwriting books who have no experience in the trade, and this book is a prime example of that trend."
1,A poorly written and organized book you should avoid.,"This book clearly reflects that the author knows little about his subject. It's poorly organized, fraught with misinformation and errors, and woefully insulting and patronizing to the reader. There are many far better ""how to"" books about this subject. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,many errors and mistakes that should have been checked first,"There are many errors and mistakes in the listings in this book: misspelled names, wrong phone numbers, wrong addresses, people are not at the companies in the listing, etc. The rest of the book is okay, more a pep talk than any real new information."
2,software reviews are good - otherwise the book is very poor,"The software reviews are good but you could get that by reading it in the library or a bookstore. I found the rest of the book very offputting, not at all helpful, and written with a smug, patronizing tone."
2,Not worth the money.,This book was an (almost) complete waste of money. Wasn't organized very well. Alot of the info was wrong. The only good thing about the book is it has some good stories.
5,Invaluable tool for anyone wanting to break into Hollywood!,"Skip's book, The Writer's Guide, has become the book that I carry around with me! I refer to it for everything, including lessons on etiquette when contacting agents or production companies. The response I have received for all of my scripts after heeding his advice in this book is overwhelming. Eight out of ten production companies have requested my screenplays, and I am certain this would have never happened without his book! He tailors each agent or producers needs specifically, so a writer can pin-point exactly who is right for a particular project. Anyone who wants to make contacts in this industry should not only read this book, but keep it with them throughout their career!"
5,The Story Goes Like This:,"The story goes like this: This book is informative, educational, and entertaining. Skip Press explains who's WHO amongst the Hollywood Game and what they want and don't want. There are lists of Agents, Producers, Writers, Directors, and so on... There are sections in the book that talk about writing for the electronic age such as the internet and writing software. A must read for all writers! I enjoyed reading this book and I think you will too.SCOTT O."
3,Almost There,"Well-written little gem of a book. Based in New York City and Queens, it captures local and seasonal atmosphere. Nevertheless, I found the ending to be rather abrupt and puzzling. There were also some elements (such as the Southern upbringing of one of the characters, or an attempted suicide by her mother) that didn't really seem relevant to the plot. It also would have been nice to get more out of all the rugs that are in Ushman's store."
2,Disappointing,"Clearly the minority, I found this book extremely boring. The language is languid, economical but completely unengaging. There was no real connection between characters, no spark of life evident anywhere. I did not care about Ushman and his sad little life. I was most interested in the character of Mrs. Roberts, but she was only peripheral. Most people seem to really like this novel so give it a try, but I was disappointed."
4,Story of isolation and loneliness,"The Rug Merchant, by Meg Mullins, is a story of what intense loneliness and isolation does to virtually all of the characters in this novel. An unlikely romance propels this story and draws you into the lives of very different people who don't seem to have anything in common. The main character, Ushman, an Iranian immigrant, is a man removed from his country, his family, and a society that he understands. We read about how all of the characters cope with virtually the same problem. This is a story about how painfully alone you can be surrounded by people. This is also a story, however, of recovery and about rejoining society and finding your place. This is a moving book that I would recommend for anyone who wants a slightly depressing, but thoroughly engaging story."
4,Poignant and memorable,"I Can't help but wonder how Mug Mullins knows these two-Ushman and Stella-so well? Perhaps she is Stella...hmm. No matter-the book is delicate and intimate, and the characters sympathetic and flawed enough to make them real. I would recommend this book for a lovely afternoon or for bedtime reading..not heavy, but truly much more than a ""chick book."""
2,Lack of character development dulled the story,"The Rug Merchant is not a book that draws the reader in. There are only a handful of characters in the book that have any dialogue exchange at all. The nineteen year old character Stella's dialogue was distractingly contrived in several places. Other than Ushman, the few characters who are in the book are boringly undeveloped and lacking in complexity. Since the characters were so simplified, I was unable to take an interest in them individually and thus had a hard time plodding on to the end of the book (but I did finish it, just to get it over with).The story had potential to be a good read, but I don't think the author was up to the task of turning a decent short story into a compelling novel."
2,BORRRRING,"I found this book to be a very slow, boring read. After a while one just wants to put the book down and forget about it. I would not waste my money on this."
2,Not so much,"Thought I'd be fascinated by the different culture perspective -- and I'm particularly fascinated by rugs. However, while I managed to keep reading, the book never ""caught"" me. It was slow, in my opinion."
2,Not about rugs,"I got excited when I saw this book for three dollars at a store. The cover was compelling. I am putting this book aside for now because the protagonist had the trash people pick up a $20,000 very special carpet that fate put in his hands. Granted, it becomes a symbolic gesture of a failed marriage. This really offended my sensibilities about these carpets. Any rug merchant who admires the work of all those female fingers with broken backs because of the weaving process, would NOT throw out such a special carpet. He would have known he should use the carpet as a prayer rug to heal his wounds.I will read this another time. I finally acquired my own very special carpet after 40 years of longing. A better book if you want the real deal about these exquisite rugs is The Blood of Flowers: A Novel by Anita Amirrezvani. That book is extraordinary. This story is about a lonely immigrant."
1,Rug Merchant,I was disappointed in this book. Had none of the interest of Kite Flyer.I was told I would like the book if I liked Kite Flyer.I was bored with Rug Merchant.
5,"A Wonderful, Thoughtful and Emotional Read","This one touched my heart. You can read the plot details in the other reviews ... it was the emotional connection with the character Ushman that surprised me. His loneliness and confusion of his place in his world was so well conveyed, that I felt and understood and related. We all have our sad stories, it's remembering that they all had elements of joy as well. A suprising and strong debut novel."
4,About More than Rugs,"This is a novel by Meg Mullins.I first noticed this book on a table at a bookstore. The hard cover version at least has a picture of a very beautiful Persian rug on the front. I have had an interest in those rugs for many years, so I decided to take a look at the book.While the backdrop for the book does have to do with these rugs, it is more a story about a man trying to find a place in another world - here an Iranian in New York City. There is a romantic part and lots of tragedy. Overall, it was a good book, but as a guy I think it was maybe a little more ""chick-lit"" than I bargained for. Rather interesting that it was written by a woman, but from a male point of view - she did a good job I think.Anyway, it has much to recommend it."
4,It's paper towel,"It's paper towel, what else can I say. Item was as described, shipped without delay and works well for us."
4,Good for the price,"A little on the thin side, but for the price, this is adequate. We use in our office and there aren't any complaints."
4,Timeless and Touching,"In this remarkably readable book, Bill Peet captures such an important lesson of life through his straight-forward writing style and exceptional artwork. The story suggests that while one's physical size might not matter all that much, perhaps the size of one's heart does. And you can never be too small to help someone else. This is certainly a wonderful lesson for children of all ages- toddler or adult. This is the second book in what I hope to be a full shelf of Bill Peet books in my home one day. I encourage you to read it."
5,i love this,WOO!! WHEW!!!!!! talk about dark chocolate being off the chain? i never get enough of these bars. they are my thing gots to go pick them up and this is a great value.
1,the songs lack depth,"very weak, not a lot of effort, vocally or in production standards. She is losing her popularity here in Louisville. Monica has a lot of growing up to do, and she needs to portray a better image of herself, I dont know what happened to her voice. The First Night is not very conclusive, and I dont like her voice on Cross Da Room, WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? I dont understand why she is getting so much praise, and her songs, they arent all that. The only one i can stand is FOR YOU I WILL, i hope she changes her style, I guess its that plastic surgery on her acnoids which significantly reduced her nose size also affected her vocals."
1,Misleading labeling,"If you are buying this CD for the blues song ""Misty Blue"", look elsewhere as it is not here. This CD is largely rap and hip hop. To paraphrase Miles Davis on Rock n Roll: Someone may like it, but I don't."
4,love it,"well, i love it and my sister love it. i think thats a good thing since i bought this cd for her. i listen to it to."
4,Monica,GREAT! I miss the old Monica or maybe its just who is writing her songs now but back then her songs were HOT!
5,exactly what i needed,"I've recently started drinking a lot of tea and honey, but finagling with the bottle of honey was an absolute pain (it's a glass bottle with a screwtop). This was basically perfect for adding just a dash of honey into a pot of tea without the mess. The fact that it's super adorable doesn't hurt either."
5,honey pots,"I loved these little honey pots with the bee on the end of the honey spoon. I like that they are smaller and I can use the honey in them faster, keeping my honey fresher."
3,"Adorable, but...","This honey pot is adorable but way too small to be of any practical use. If you're planning on setting it out for a family breakfast, this won't work."
5,"cute, good quality","Perfect for my young children who like to do everything themselves. It's small for small portions and keeps the drips in fair control. They love it, think it's so cute. It's good quality ceramic, an ochre color with a wooden dipper."
4,satisfied,"I bought my own in Canada a few years ago and paid more for it.I've been on the lookout locally to no avail. Found it on Amazon, ordered two for gifts. Everyone happy."
1,Not New,"This item came available for pre-order which usually indicates a new release. This is not, it's the Christmas episode from 2001. The DVD was marketed in such a way as to give the impression of something new or previously unreleased, this is not the case. If you don't already own it and like Barbe by all means order it."
4,Better than your average Barbie movie.,"The music was beautiful of course and the choreography was nice as well for a kids movie. I definitely enjoyed watching it with my daughter more than most the inane ""girls"" movies that are out to watch."
1,trashing a classic,"What a joke! Any resemblance of the E.T.A. Hoffman story/Tchaikovski ballet to this DVD is purely coincidental. The ballet musical numbers are chopped up and rearranged and much is left on the cutting room floor. The story goes off into really strange directions that have little to do with the original story - the Mouse King is not that central a character except here. I could see kids enjoying this but I could also see young kids being scared by it. But this is just more money in the pockets of people who own the Barbie copyrights, and if a holiday favorite gets trashed along the way, who cares as long as we turn a profit. Avoid this muddled mess and get a DVD of the real ballet."
1,What were they thinking?,"This movie is unneccesarily frightening. There are whole segments that have nothing to do with the Nutcracker. There is very little dancing and alot of fighting and running away from very scary villans. My daughters were very afraid of the rock monster and the mouse king, they don't want to see it again. I beleive that this movie falls into the category of lets scare the hell out of the kids. This movie is nothing like the Nutcracker that one usually thinks of, it is completely altered and not very entertaining, unless you like your kids to have nightmares."
1,Scary!,"This video is so scary, my 3 year old was going,""Mom, what are they doing?"" I finally shut it off and am going to return it tomorrow. Also, the story does not follow the real ballet. I'd rather have the real thing. In short, I was Very DISSAPPOINTED in this video. I certainly do not recommend it!"
1,Not what I was expecting,"I am planning on taking my 4 yo daughter to see the actual ballet, so I was hoping to get her familiar with the music & story beforehand. I borrowed the Barbie movie from a friend of mine who said it was really good. Now I am annoyed because this adaptation is NOTHING like the actual ballet, and now I have to try to explain why the versions are so different. As a stand-alone piece, this movie wouldn't be so bad (although it's as Barbie-saccharine as you'd expect). It's just sad that they are calling it ""The Nutcracker,"" when it really isn't. Apples and oranges."
5,product review,is shipped fast it's in great shape looks like new no damage and no scratches it plays like new I love the product
5,Perfect!,"It was in perfect condition and my girls love the movie, we would def. get more i am hoping to get all of the barbie movies so i hope there is more"
5,Really a lovely movie,"I've never really understood the fuss about Barbie being ""unrealistic"" - she's a doll! Not much about dolls are realistic. But anyway, as for the movie - it is super! Both of my girls saw it a couple of years ago and really loved it. I've appreciated every Barbie movie I've seen - as a previous commenter mentioned, the girl is the heroine. I find that to be true in all of the Barbie movies. They teach the importance of friendship, honesty, loyalty and courage. Nutcracker is a Christmas charmer; if you've seen previous Barbie movies and liked them, you won't be disappointed. If you haven't, this one is a great one to start with!"
1,Yuck!!!,"I am so glad I decided to view this video before I spent good money on it. The computer animation is stiff and wooden, and the plot doesn't keep to the original version. The characters talk, instead of just dance the story. My 4 yr old daughter was screaming all through the mouse fights. Then for some reason the sugarplum fairy is the only one who can restore Barbie to her original size. Somehow she had become shrunk. My daughter who loves both ballet and Barbie just ordered us to turn it off. Any ballet fans should steer clear of this one. Take your child to see the real thing, or invest in a video that has live ballet dancers in it."
3,"This is movie at best is ""ok"".",It's not scarey at all. But is boring to watch but Barbie fans will still like it. I highly recommend Barbie As Rapunzel without a doubt. So much more engaging!
3,OK movie,I like this movie but it`s not my favorite one.The Princess and the Pauper is the best one.But I think that Mattel did an ok job on this movie.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*
1,This movie was B-A-D,"I can't believe they capitalized the 'her' in the phrase ""Starring in Her first movie"". What is she, some goddess??"
1,I can't rate this 0 stars? :(,Oh my God. A Barbie video? Don't tell me who did this. HAS EVERYONE GONE INSANE?
4,Better than you'd expect...,"We bought this to replace our original which mysteriously (ok, not so mysteriously) was scratched and skipping. The first of the Barbie movies, Nutcracker offers the London Symphony Orchestra playing and computer animated ballerinas dancing to actual pieces from Tchaikovsky's work. The Barbie movie trademark is twisting stories so that Barbie (heroine) uses honor, determination and quick wit to save the day. I think it is a good way to introduce kids to a classical piece. Tim Curry is great comic relief as the Mouse King. My now 5 year old son will watch it with my daughter (though he'd never admit it!)"
3,What a combination!,"Barbie in a Christmas classic... somehow that struck me as a big odd... Anyway, I've found that my kids somehow prefer these 3D animated ""cartoon"" to the traditional ones. For that reason, they've watched this probably more than they would have it it were just a cartoon. But overall this is a video the kids will enjoy."
4,A very nice movie,"This is a nice movie,GREAT MUSICGOOD STORYEXCELLENT VOICE KELLY SHERIDANGREAT BALLETP.S IF I COULD GIVE THIS MOVIE FOUR AND A HALF STARS I WOULDP.P.S SOME OTHER GRET BARBIE MOVIES ARE:SWAN LAKE 4 STARSRAPUNZEL 5 STARSTHE PRINCESS AND THE PAUPER 5 STARSTHE 12 DANCING PRINCESSES 100 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Just ok.,"My daughter got Barbie and the 12 Dancing Princesses for her birthday and LOVES it. So, knowing how much she likes that one, Santa brought her Barbie in the Nutcracker but she wasn't very impressed. There isn't much dancing which is what we wanted and expected. It is cute but not as cute as we hoped... this won't be one she watches over and over like the 12 Dancing Princesses."
3,Definitely Not What I Thought,"While this was an adorable movie featuring Barbie it's definitely not The Nutcracker. There was barely no dancing, it was more of a love story between Clara/Sugarplum Fairy/Barbie and Erik/Prince Erik/Ken.If you're looking for The Nutcracker this is definitely not the way to go. If you're looking for a cute cartoon romance this is for you."
2,Too scary,"I thought this video was too scary and the scary mice parts in the middle outweighed the dancing and music at the beginning and end. I started it for my 4-yr old granddaughter, who loves Barbie and dancing, left the room, and came back to a terrified child cowering behind the couch. I stayed with her while I fast-forwarded to see what else was coming, and it was still too much for her. I think this would also frighten her 5-yr old sister. This video should not be seen by children without an entire viewing by an adult prior to showing it."
3,Not a new movie. It is a 2001 movie.,"We cracked open this cellophane wrapped movie excited for a NEW Christmas Barbie movie. The animation looks dated. Very dated. I suspected something was wrong, like the production company changed or someone made the movie on an older computer. Literally, the animation looks like animatics you see for Pixar. (not a compliment). Then I realized it was a 2001 repackaged DVD. Well they duped me and my family. Sad to say. Is the story passable. Mmm. the girls liked it well enough. But me and my son who have watched and were entertained by other Barbie movies were pretty bored.So, for repackaging... I should give this only 1 star. But because my girls liked it well enough, I split the difference. Good luck to you if you don't mind being duped with a repackaged title. Still has nice message about Christmas etc. Enjoy if you don't mind a 2001 movie at 2010 prices."
4,For Little Girls,My four-year-old granddaughter really enjoyed this well-done movie. And her mom and I also found the story enchanting. A nice take on the original story. Great for girls ages 3 to 8.
2,Not Bad,"I don't mean ""not bad"" in the colloquial sense (meaning ""good"") but not awful.It is kind of splitting hairs to find fault with this for not following The Nutcracker ballet's plot--the story was changed so much from Hoffman's tale when they made it into a ballet.But the fact is, despite the title, you can't use this movie to introduce your child to the ballet. Not one dance appears in its entirety, the music is utterly out of sequence, they added characters and deleted them with what seems a careless disregard for the story we have become familiar with. (Why did we need a bat with an English accent? Why a rock monster? Why kill off Clara's parents and change her brother's name?)It's a cute, albeit obvious, story, and the animation is good. If they had called it ""Barbie's Sweetland Adventure"" I would have given it three stars, but to call it ""Barbie in the Nutcracker"" is just false advertising."
3,Too scary for young children,My granddaughter is 4yrs old and after previewing this movie I felt I could not let her see it. The plot was very frightening and there was very little ballet.
5,A must-have for your little princess!,"My 3 year old daughter started ballet lessions 2 months ago. She loves it. This movie made her feel special. She saw Barbie and Kelly doing ballet. The mouse king was scary to her at first however by the middle of the movie, she was yelling ""Bad Mouse King- Stop It!"" Plus the special NY ballet segment on this DVD was very fascinating and educational. My daughter also enjoyed this segment. Seeing other ballerinas made her practice her own steps and she saw the result of practicing.I love this movie and highly recommend it."
3,It's not that scary,My four and seven year old girls loved this movie. It takes some license with the ballet but is a good intro to it. I'm shocked kids found the mouse king scary. Mine didn't at all. Goofy maybe.
4,I was pleasantly surprised!,"When my 3-year-old daughter picked this movie out to watch, I tried to convince her to look at something else. But I was surprised to find that I liked this movie. The music is wonderful and now she is excited to pick Tchaikovsky out on the classical Christmas album we have. The animation was better than I expected. It has nurtured her budding interest in ballet and music. If you're expecting a not-so-interesting Barbie and Ken adventure you might find yourself pleasantly surprised by Clara and her Nutcracker."
4,Very Cute...,"This is a very well made movie, the graphics are great. I was very excited that Barbie was coming out with her own movie!But, it doesn't hold my daughter's interest just yet. At 2 years old, she is a movie fanatic..she will sit through most movies that she likes (such as Toy Story) but this one I must say she doesn't care for.I think she will like it more in a year or two. I am not disappointed that I bought it, as I think we will get use out of it later on :)I recommend this for the seriously girly barbie girl in your life! :)"
4,A Lovely Story,"Janet Rosauer's words are calm and spiritually sincere as she reassures us that her faith is strong. You can't help but be moved by her ""knowing"" sense of what really matters most in our lives. Simply stated, this is a lovely story of pain, joy, loss and moving on with grace."
1,This is not the uncut show as shown in England,"This version is 172 minutes, the British version is 180 min. - 8 minutes gone. My suspicion would be that none of the cuts were in boring parts of the story. YMMV>I have multi-region players so I will be buying from Amazon UK."
5,A Wild Romp,"I couldn't resist ordering this when I saw Doctor Who's David Tenant in the role of Casanova. He gives a brilliant and very entertaining performance. Anyone who is a David Tenant, or a Casanova fan should love this film. It was filmed beautifully and apparently no expense was spared to make it a top notch effort. I highly recommend it."
3,Bought it because David Tennant was in it....,"But in the grand scheme of things, not a very good telling of Casanova's life. It goes too bizarre, far too flighty and unfortunately, not even the sex scenes can save it. If you buy it, it's not the end of the world. But I'd sugest giving this one a pass..."
4,Hilarious Romp,"Exactly the hilarious romp I expected from the writing of Russell T. Davies. David Tennant is delightful, charming and sometimes disturbing in the lead role of the most famous seducer in literature. If you are expecting this to be a historically accurate film, you will be disappointed. Anyone who has ever seen Davies Dr. Who work will not be surprised at the unusual parade of characters or Casanova's stance on ""morality"". Rich costumes, beautiful scenery, creative use of make-up and memorable characters all come together to create a delightful film about judging others and taking excesses too far."
3,"It's OK, but falls down in one major area","This is a pleasant romp, reasonable costumes and settings, the acting is OK, but there is one major problem with this, and that's the story. People don't want to watch Casanova being a one-woman man! People want to watch Casanova seducing countless women, escaping angered husbands, etc.! This movie opened promisingly with a daring leap out a window followed by a chase-on-foot through Venice, but then it all turned into a 'Casanova loves Henriette' story. The O'Toole parts were fine - that man could read a shopping list and make it work - but sadly I feel Tennant could have been a very fun and memorable Casanova if the story had been less of a 'standard love story' and more of a 'Casanova's exploits' story.Perhaps other reviewers are watching this for Tennant's presence and not so much for the Casanova story, in which case it's very satisfying. Oh well."
4,Another Masterpiece Winner,"As always, Masterpiece Theater has done it again. This is fun, campy, and at times very moving. It does explore sexual issues that some will find disturbing. With a subject like Casanove that is hardly surprising. Definitely worth a watch."
1,Casanova (Masterpiece Theater),"Terrible ! Utter trash! If you want to find out about Casanova, read his magnificent autobiography."
4,just missed...but still electric read,"Sutcliffe has been generally on target for many of her books and seems to improve with each one. This one has so much going for it, and yet...A great locale, done well, New Orleans gives an eerie backdrop without too much of the ""party-on-down, Cher"". She has a gritty story (maybe a wee bit too gritty for romance) and unfortunately not enough romance to balance it. Everything felt forced, abrupt, not with her usual finesse. Some of the characters were a little trite, overdone. But where the book hurts mosts is the play between the leads. It's just a little too contrived, like forcing that square peg into a round hole. Something are never fully explained...So this one leaves you with mixed feelings. Just a shame a few of these nagging problems could not have been ironed out for it is still a powerful read despite them."
4,Okay for the money,"very inexpensive earrings. The picture is accurate but I guess I expected something a little more sparkly or lustrous in some way. Again, for only $5 I wasn't expecting Harry Winston, but still"
4,Intersteing Story,"I got this book as research material for a book I'm writing. Haven't finished ""Friendships in the Dark"" yet, but it's a very interesting story about a blind girl and her special pets. The book follows her life to adulthood, but I haven't gotten to that part yet. (-:"
3,Overrated but still I think its worth it...,We Financial advisors are always looking for an edge. To often we're severely dissapointed. This book has merit and unfortunately a lot of fluff. Most in the industry know all the software available and filing systems.What was of interest was the parts on client retention and firing clients. This was helpfulIn the sense that it improved my vision of my practice I have to say it was worthwhile. However a well written article could have done the same.Your call..
2,Not what it's hyped to be,"I'm a retail stockbroker/financial planner. The material is almost completely useless for retail brokers and most financial planners. The material would mainly be usable by fee-only financial planners catering to extremely wealthy individuals and wishing to take the author's ""concierge"" approach to servicing clients. For most retail brokers, insurance agents, and most financial planners, the book contains little of use; don't waste your money on it."
2,A big disappointment,"After all the rave reviews, I thought this would be a great book on practice management. What I got was a book by Deena Katz on Deena Katz. For example, in discussing contact management systems, she glosses over Act! and Goldmine; barely mentions Text Library System and ProTracker, but spends considerable time talking about paying $50,000 to have a consultant design a system. If you currently have a fee only practice that is grossing in the high 6-figures and want to develop it into a multi-million $ firm, like Deena Katz, then I suggest you read this book."
4,NOT aquaraiders,"I love Aqua Raiders products but I can tell you this is NOT one.In the upper left hand corner of Lego product boxes, it has the red and white Lego logo. next to that it says what type of Lego product it is(i.e: Star Wars, Mars Mission, Bionicles, City, Castle, Vikings,). One of them is Lego System. Lego System is a model that has no category so is given its own. This product is Lego System. It's called an *Aqua* Dozer but that doesn't make it an Aqua Raiders product. For those of you who are looking for Aqua Raiders, you wont find them here. For those of you who are looking for Lego system, this is your lucky day. But for those of you who either want to buy regular Lego, something to take apart to use the bricks for something else, or want to buy something that can be used as Aqua Raiders, I'm sure this product is great."
5,What a small musical should be,"When I read the synopsis, I decided that I needed to hear the CD. I was expecting the fun of pieces like ""Penguins Must Sing"" and ""Chekhov"". I was not prepared for the lovely ""She's Out There"", or to be bowled over by ""Imagining You"", an intimate look into eight people's minds and hearts, grandly interwoven with counter-melodies. I also admit to having trouble not dancing during the delightful ""Birds of Paradise"", and then having to remind myself to listen to the lyrics -- it's one of the funniest numbers in the show. I am recommending this CD to all of my musical theatre buff friends."
1,This product is NOT going to help you build a website,"This product is nothing more than a bunch of HTML scripts. You can find better scripts if you Google ""FREE HTML scripts"" Then download NVU the HTML editor for free!"
5,Wimzie's Be Yourself,"My now 8 year old loved Wimzie, but it went off the air. We were able to receive this DVD for our 3 year old. We love it and the message it portrays. We are all special despite things we can't do."
5,Very Nice!,"Just what we were looking for. Light, small, great quality, and easy to pack. Great price, too. Will use mostly for travel. Used them for whale watching in Hawaii."
4,great binoculars,"Small and lightweight but the adjustments for eye position a little awkward. Still overall, a good buy."
3,Nikon Binocular,I purchased these binoculars based on the Nikon name and the low price for them. This item is of very good quality for the minimalist. They are not the most powerful binoculars by any means but they are perfect for what I wanted to use them for. We have an old set of binoculars that are more powerful but they are heavy. The Nikon Travelite is just the right size and weight for bird watching and viewing the other critters we have visiting our back yard which is pretty much a haven for small animals.
5,"Great binoculars, very easy to use.",Much better clarity & focus than older pair. Will get a lot of use from these in the future.
5,Affordable quality and light weight,"In selecting a binocular to use in my backpacking and mountaineering hobbies, I wanted something small, light weight, and with reasonably good optics, yet not so expensive that I'd cry in my beer for days should I drop or otherwise damage them. These binoculars seemed to be the ideal choice. Although slightly more expensive than the half-dozen other brands which I compared them with, to my eyes the Nikon Travelites had noticeably superior optics. They are compact yet comfortable to hold, and the rubber body covering provides for a secure grip. And with a weight of around 9-ounces I almost never give a second thought about adding them to my pack. I chose the 10x model, but 8x, 9x, and 12x models are also available for those with differing needs and preferences. An all around quality binocular for this price range."
4,Good Value,"I bought this wallet as a gift for my boyfriend's 21st birthday. He said he needed a wallet with a lot of pockets for his various cards and would prefer a bill fold over a tri fold. I had it delivered to me so I could check the product out and wrap it and everything. There was a bit of cosmetic damage on the inside which I wasn't able to fix. There were also a couple of short threads sticking out around the wallet; I secured them all with a little clear nail polish. Also, when I pulled the card out that came in the clear pocket, it left a stain on the clear plastic that I had to get out with nail polish remover. It was also a bit stiff but that's to be expected from a new wallet, and I made it a little softer with some leather conditioner.All in all, great value, good product, only a little fixing up."
4,Satsify,I purchase this wallet because i had the exact same wallet before and it lasted me very long and i search for this wallet and am a very satisfy customer and hope this one can last me another five years . So who ever wish to purchase this type of wallet i think they will be satisfy . I surely will recommend this wallet to anyone although is less expensive .
3,LIght-Weight Leather,I purchased this for my husband after reading reviews by others. After receiving the item we realized that the leather was far to 'light' and was not the weight he is accustomed to.On a positive note it certainly does have many pockets and lots of room. The seller was very prompt with shipping.
2,Holds plenty of credit cards.....but,"This was advertised as a tri-fold wallet. It is a tri-fold, but folds differently than standard tri-fold. There is plenty of room for credit cards, pictures etc. However, if you overload it, it is extremely differcult to insert & take out bills."
3,Cheap is cheap: not for coins (2),"The wallet is nice but smells goat skin. After two hours of use having placed coins in the zipped slot for coins, the whole cloth protecting coins from escaping was unstitched and the coins fell on the floor. It can't be used for coins. It's fine for bills and credit cards."
2,"Geek squad design, weak sound","As I do a considerable amount of traveling, I thought that I would treat myself to some incredible headphones to use with my ipod and treo. Researching the market, the product description can lead one to see these earphones as a real possibility.The reality is that the design is quite bulky and not discrete to wear, in short, geeky looking. The sound lacks any kind of richness that one would expect from a premium earphone. God bless the 30-day money back guarantee ;-)"
4,one of the best,"there are other books that tell you the whole process of applying and preparing your apps. you should get one of those but also get this one. this is one of its kind. it's a small book with some really great essays. exactly what i needed. it's easy to get confused in the whole process of preparing apps; selection of schools, school visits, selecting and talking to recommenders etc. and if you start reading tips of what to write and what not write in your essays, you can easily spend weeks just browsing the internet and taking notes.this book will give you a good headstart for your essays."
4,well done,"I'm not convinced that the author's insights are new revelations for this genre of books. His acknowledgement of common pitfall and specific advise, especiall in branding and essay writing are worth the cost of the book."
3,Good 2nd or 3rd book,"This book is good, but not great. I would recommend this as a good 2nd or 3rd book to have. Start of with Robert Montauk, as it will provide better context for this this book.Another thing to note is that thhese are not 65 complete applications, rather 65 essays. I was a little bummber when I realized that."
5,a good product,"This item allows me to store all of my knives, even a chopper and butcher knife. Excellent product. I highly recommend this if you have loose knives in the way in your kitchen."
4,"Works well, good price",I don't think there is such thing as a perfect knife block when you have a wide variety of knives but this one is pretty darn close. A few of the slots don't work for my tools but overall I really like it.
4,Toms Deodorant,"really Like Toms Deodorant line, even the unscented has a slight hint of freshness that cant be denied but is so fitting. My underarms thank you Tom."
1,"disapointing, unengaging for me","I believe it's a matter of chemistry, but this book did not get me at all. i've been dragging it around for months (very strange in me), and though i read till half of the book with the hope of it improving, the opositte happended. The second half of the book i jumped across the pages, read diagonically, the first and last sentences of ecah chapter, not even the ending got me, what a pity... maybe it's my fault, but i never found a duller read before. Sorry to be so negative..."
1,The Worst!,"The pre-publicity on this book led me to think that it would be interesting and enlightening. Instead, it was a book with no character or plot development and a massive amount of data signifying..what? E.L. Doctrow did this much better in ""Ragtime"". He had real people who signified various threads that have explified much of the color and pain of the twentieth and twenty-first century in American life."
1,Am I Missing Something?,"I Ordered this book hoping to see in writing what I enjoyed so much in the movie "" Far and Away "" starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. They both cover approximately the same period of our country's development. Boy, was I in for a huge disappointment! The author""s fictional tome was a series of rambling episodes that lacked cohesion and interest. The lead characters were the most vapid individuals I've encountered in years. I noticed that this title made a quick exit from the Best Seller list and I had the good fortune to unload my copy to another unsuspecting customer via my Amazon for sale listing. My advice is to keep looking and waiting for a writer of fiction to successfully capture the flavor and personalities of this rather fascinating era of US history."
4,Surprisingly good,"As historical novels go this was not what I expected. It is a bit too long, and it drags in places. I found myself skipping large passages because they were not really relevant. Perhaps it is 200 pages overwritten. But it is a good story, well researched for authenticity and well plotted with interesting characters and the historical time frame is extremely interesting.I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys thick books, big plots and history as authentically researched as possible."
2,Disappointed,"Interesting in the concept of weaving the story lines; but disappointed in the story as a whole. If you read the liner notes on the dust jacket, you've read the story. Just having a few historical names scattered within the storyline doesn't make for an historical novel. I find reading real history more interesting....I looked up Fremont, one of the characters noted in the novel on wikipedia and found the information on him much more interesting. The characters just plodded on. Thus I couldn't wait for the end; it was not a ""page turner"" for me....it was a bore."
1,Disappointing,"I expected a great great read, and that's the way the book begins. The momentum soon bogs down into a mediocre TV series. Dog-lovers need beware of a particular scene that is simply unnecessary and cruel.I would suggest ""Witnessing America"" (nonfiction) or ""Time and Again"" for excellent historical story-telling."
3,Disappointing.,"""Heyday"" has the premise for being a really good book. I just couldn't get through it. Yes, the author has done his homework, but something was lacking. The characters were interesting, particularly the pseudo journalist/daguerreotypist, Skaggs and the actress/prostitute Polly. The rest of the characters just didn't seem to come up to 3 dimensional. I think that some of the ""period"" feel of the book just didn't come off as 19th Century but more or less as putting 21st Century mores and morals into the minds of Victorian individuals. The plot jumped around too much and it was more like a TV mini-series than a well thought out story. I got over half-way through this and got tired of meaningless ploys and sub-plots. If one wants to read a thought-provoking story with twists and turns and a genuine 19th Century feel, then I would suggest Michael Cox's ""The Meaning of Night."""
2,boring,I started this book. I got about 150 pages into it before I gave it up. It just bored me to death. I prefer an author who can really tell a story. Kurt Andersen can't. At least he's not my type of writer.
1,Heyday,"After the nice review on Charlie Rose, I frankly don't understand as the book is really not very interesting."
2,the Little RedTrain zigsaw,"Shipping was in a timely manner HOWEVER, for a book of puzzles, one whole puzzle was completely missing. Explain that to a 3yr. old."
3,Really mixed on this,"Great visuals and attention to so much detail on the age. If you have not read Vile Things, the plot gets quite confusing. I had to watch it twice to understand what was really going on in this film. One gets lost in all the back and forth, but fantastically and visually stunning."
2,Hmmmm,"Sorry Mr. Ebert, for my wife and I disagree. We struggled to get this one through to the end but I am giving two stars because of the era and it did have a few bright spots. You can skip this one and not miss anything.PS-If the film was accurate, I didn't realize the 'white powder' was so popular back then....interesting."
2,Disappointed,When I listened to a sample of this CD it did not sound like Opera to me. Most of the album was Opera sounding and I was upset about some of the language in it.
4,A revelation! Steve Allen's work never sounded so great!,"I saw Bugatti at the Bellagio in Las Vegas and was so impressed by his style and showmanship that I sought out and bought this CD. Now I've always been one of those people, confronted by some yahoo telling me that Steve Allen is the most prolific composer in history, who says, ""Yeah? Name one song."" Well, judging from this record, Allen is pretty much a generic, listmaking kind of writer (""Strawberry moon, Blueberry sky, Polkadot stars, Shining on high"" is as deep as he goes), but Bugatti manages to elevate this greengrocer material to something special. He emotes, and the audience feels.Check it out."
5,Beautiful and comfortable!,"These shoes are very pretty and they didn't hurt my feet at all after wearing them for 6 hours at a holiday dance. I purchased them in black and they'll be versatile enough to wear for formal or everyday occasions. They are well made and I feel that I got them at a bargain price, especially with the $20 discount offer. I am debating on buying another pair in a different color."
3,Current mood: pensive,"Initially, I loved this CD. The tracks were great, and I enjoyed the order of them. But after playing it over and over (which I do to CDs I love, and the good ones stand up to scrutiny), I realized that unlike Hotel Costes, this CD just had songs. It wasn't a head trip, a smooth ride, it had an odd sound played in between each track that sounded like a cross between the echo of a record being changed and the gong-like noise heard in Track 3 (Moonlight), and the next song would begin with a bang. I found this a bit jarring. I listen to music on my commute, a good 3 hours everyday, the last thing I want some mornings is to be rudely awoken by my chillout music. It's, um, chillout, lounge. Not heavy metal. So aside from the cheap and jarring transitions, I like this CD a lot; I just am really getting annoyed with the transitions, and I am regularly passing it over for old favourites (Hotel Costes)."
2,Stick with your LP... that's what they did!,"For those who remember this record, yes it's one of the funniest things National Lampoon ever did. My LP was sounding pretty worn. So much so, in fact, that I dubbed it onto a CD so I wouldn't have to put any more wear and tear on the vinyl while I waited for somebody to put out a real CD. Not only was this CD *not* made from the master tapes, it wasn't made from a tape at all. It was mastered from an LP (just like my homemade CD), apparently with no effort to clean up the surface noise or ticks and pops. 5 stars for content, but zero stars for not going back to the master tapes. Let's hope Uproar does a better job in a few months when they reissue Goodbye Pop."
2,"national lampoon's ""that's not funny, that's sick""","I purchased this CD, new, on July 17th,2006. It is a great collection of classic comedy, however, Amazon is still shipping the copies made before 2005, mastered from vinyl with scratches, hisses and all. I solely wanted to listen to 'Mr. Roberts 1"" with the egg-a-muffin' skit and it skips over most of this skit. The promise by Mr. David Drozen to replace it, rings hollow. Neither from him or Amazon can I get a 'clean, remastered', 2005 version. So, I'll send it back for a refund. It's a shame because the material is so classic. I was going to buy the box set, next. Oh, well."
4,VERY NICE,"Necklace arrived sooner than estimated, was packaged very well - giving it no chance to tangle. Loved the pendant - so colorful! My only 'complaint' would be that the chain could be better quality. It's so lightweight that the back of the chain works itself to the front of your neck multiple times during the day. It gets annoying by the end of the day. If not for the chain, I would give this product 5 stars. I will def get another chain for the pendant. Other than the chain, love this piece. I will be buying earrings to match soon."
1,Missing alignmnet tool - paid for fast shipping - unfair amazon!,This was missing the alignment tool. This is why I ordered it in the first place. Package had been opened. I paid for fast shipping but return takes 14 days!!!!! I'm screwed. Thanks Amazon!! Never again!!!!!!!!!!
3,No Running Please,"You can't run with this on your arm, it will fall of and break and you will cry. For biking however this arm band is pretty good . The thing is the Vision M is a heavy object and the velcro strap that comes with this FlexiSkin only covers about 20% of the back making it very unsecure. The FlexiSkin itself is a good protector and I would recommend gettign some sort of PDA cover aswell to protect from scractches. But for running i'd either wait a while until some company comes out with more accesories for this relatively new product or go to an outdoor type store, find some backpack straps and fashion a better strap for this thing. The reason it gets 3 stars is because when you buy somethign with an armband its primary function is to stay on your arm while doing some sort of physical activity and it doesnt really do that well for running... the most common on those physical activities. It is also very overpriced from amazon but secondary sellers are selling it for decent prices."
4,High quality budget tea,"I drink a lot of tea and felt that I had to comment given that only 1 review was posted for this product. Lipton tea is probably the largest selling tea brand in the world. It is renown for its quality in the budget price range. It is not a ""specialty"" tea but represents very good value - far surpassing the average store brand. It will brew a strong distinctly red colored tea.Having said all of this, the price listed here is quite high..."
5,Fantastic!,"I have 2 other books on WIn98SE. Neither one comes close to the depth of content that this book has, and both cost more. I should have bought this one FIRST!"
2,"works, but...","Shortly after purchasing this item, the display readout failed. The unit was still doing its basic job, but loosing the display was inconvenient at the least. I pwuld have had to ship it somewhere for warranty repair and would have had to do without the unit in the meantime. It would have been one thing if it had failed a year or two later, but the unit was practically new."
2,Cuts out too early!,"I purchased this for my off grid RV. I currently have 5 deep cycle batteries hooked up to it. It shuts down as soon as the voltage drops below 12 volts (not 10 as stated). The five batteries that I use exceed the required amperage that it needs, so that should not be an issue. It cuts out when I am running my coffee maker or while watching a DVD on the TV. I believe that this is more suited for an 18 wheeler with the engine running (recharging) rather than running off stored energy. I will look into a smaller unit (1000-1500 watts). I did purchase the remote for it which works great until it shuts down."
5,A stunning production on all levels!,"Maria Ewing is at her best! This production is profound, well sung and well acted. Naturally, the music and sound quality are also wonderful. Opera fans and novices alike will marvel at this Glyndebourne Festival Opera performance. See the Roman Emperor Nero and his equally amoral lover, the seductive Poppea, as they tread upon all that is Good. Even the just philosopher Seneca cannot escape their evil machinations. A must-see for classicists, historians, opera fans and anyone else who enjoys high quality theatrical performance. The brief introduction and excellent subtitles help in making this production an unforgettable opera experience."
5,Unauthentic? Good!,"Monteverdi didn't mentioned the instruments in his score, hence there is much room for interpretation.Luckily, they decided not to be authentic and use modern instruments with all their depth, instead of shallow baroque instruments.There is also no voice-type specification.Nero most of the time is sung by a soprano without any good reason. Here he is sung by a tenor.Poppea's nurse is commonly sung by a tenor (weird...), but here is sung by a strong female alto.The singers have a dramatic background and are not specialist in the field of baroque opera.It is actually an advantage!Lloyd and Ewing stand out.Even for me, who don't care much for Monteverdi, it was a pleasure to watch and hear."
5,This should be in every opera fans library.,"Maria Ewing is a friend of mine. I have always been thrilled by her performances. This performance is no different. She is stunning as is the entire cast and production. This should be in every opera fans library. But, more importantly, this DVD would be a great tool to turn new fans on to opera and how exciting and informative it can be when done correctly! Brava and Bravo!!!"
3,rare mixes maybe. Sought after? note exactly...,"This disc suffers from two problems--1, most of the mixes on here are not the mixes people actually wanted when these songs were released. Second, while there are some big club artists on here, many of the songs featured aren't the artists BIG club hits. Odd, but perhaps this was the stuff beingplayed overseas, considering this is an import. It's not beatmixed, and it's all full length mixes. There are a couple of goodies for fanatical fans of remixers, but the casual fan may be disappointed in not getting the mixes they are familiar with. Track times:1. the bomb (5:01)2. got to have your love (5:17)3. 7 days and 1 week (7:37)4. my desire (6:52)5. nightmare (5:36)6. reach (7:57)7. river of tears (7:06)8. good life (6:13)9. back to life (7:30)10. i need you (6:18)11. caught in the middle (10:00)"
2,Dark Book,"Read the reviews and it sounded like the kind of book I was interested in for my boy. I was looking for a book that teaches simple life lessons. This book is quite dark and a little somber, actually it's just darn depressing. The art is pretty cool though. I misinterpreted the title and thought it's message would be rather that you should be just who you are, but I didn't get that from this book. So perhaps my expectation was too different."
2,Not for serious consultants,"I've spent over 10 years with Big 5 consulting firms and read this book with a great degree of enthusiasm, given the background of the authors. But I was very disappointed! The book is laced with ""feel good"" examples about what other firms are doing in running their practices without actually formulating any definitive conclusions or suggestions (as one would find in David Maister's work). It appears more like the authors talking about their experiences/adventures with no particular audience in mind. So if you want to read this book, do not expect any serious advice coming out of it.Hope this is helpful"
1,Bait and switch!,"Despite the misleading title, this is not a ""monster"" movie in any sense of the word. The ""mystery"" of what's happening is about as challenging as a Scooby Doo caper. If you're not able to figure out what's going on within the first 10 minutes of this film, you're synapses simply aren't firing. It's marginally fun to watch only because it's so stupid, but if you're a fan of ""classic"" monster films, don't bother."
2,OK MYSTERY YARN NOT RELATED TO WEREWOLF OF LONDON!,"This is a very disappointing film for anyone going into it thinking they are going to see monsters. One of Universal's weakest films and sneakiest tricks! Shame on you! It's an OK murder mystery at best and they only reason to see it is because it is included with three other ""Werewolf"" films on the Wolfman Legacy Collection DVD set. The DVD transfer is very good and they are some interesting extras."
2,Case of the Missing Werewolf,"Nothing much happens in this very minor mystery (not really a horror film) from Universal's post-classic era. As in PRC's Devil Bat's Daughter (also 1946), a tortured girl believes herself to be a monster on the prowl as a result of a tainted heritage or a legendary curse. If you're looking for werewolves in London, you better look elsewhere: lycanthropy only appears as the title of a book read by the heroine. Fans of the Sherlock Holmes series might enjoy the presence of Dennis Hoey as a diligent Scotland Yard inspector (unlike Lestrade), Lloyd Corrigan as a Watson-like assistant, character actors Martin Koslek (Persuit in Algiers)and Frederick Worlock (Dressed to Kill), plus the garden weeder from Scarlet Claw. Also in tow is scotsman Jimmy Finlayson -of Laurel & Hardy fame- as a uniformed constable."
4,Good mystery adventures,I have seen better Lynley episodes but this one is above average. This is the standard British 'who dunnit' with lots of great English scenery and many twists and turns in the plot. The ending struck me as a bit silly and somewhat unbelievable but these are made for TV and entertainment. I am a car nut so footage ofthe old Bristol is usually enough to entertain me.
5,A new perspective,Paul Johnson brings a different look at art reevaluating older traditions and criticizing some modern tendencies using basic humanistic criteria.
3,my brain exploded and my eyeballs are fried,To say this book is long is an understatement so you do get your money's worth. Could use a serious index and I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who isn't knowledgeable about art despite Johnson approaching it from a layman's point of view. Problem is Johnson is no ordinary layman. He has a slant on art which is intriguing and a lot of which I can get behind.Problem is he does go on and on and on too much. Good writing is about getting to the point quickly and making succinct observations...and letting the reader decide. Give us info and enough with the polemics.
2,Not enough illustrations,"Johnson writes a very opinionated book which is refreshing, although I didn't always agree with him. I would have given 4 stars but there are not nearly enough illustrations. Something critical in an art history book. He often referred to works which I'm not familair with and were not illustrated. I found this to be very frustrating."
2,An affordable reference on Art History; but seriously lacking,"""Art: A New History: by Paul JohnsonIf nothing else, this text has a bargain price; but there are critical shortcomings with the book. First, it is minimally illustrated, even if the colorful reproductions in the book are useful. What it lacks is reproduction of some of the most critical drawings and paintings ever made. It has only a couple of works by Francisco Goya, and none of his major work. Likewise with Picasso. ""Guernica"" is not represented in the book, and it is one of the most powerful murals the artist ever produced.Another reviewer correctly identified that the history seems to elevate certain secondary or minor aspects of art history, while sublimating major or primary elements of art history. This is a difficulty.Although the book is large, and has some utility, I cannot recommend it highly. If one can afford it, some usefulness can be obtained, but it may leave the reader with an erroneous perception of the artists."
1,The Insentive Eye,"A stunningly mediocre book. Unorthodox, revisionist stances, can often be bracing. Johnson's are merely inane. He seem incapable of seeing with a sympathetic eye. His biases are pervasive and uninteresting. So one can ""learn"" from Johnson that Giotto is ""wooden""; that Artemisia Gentlischi ""weakness was that she was overweight""; that Cezanne is a ""would be realist"" producing ""crude"" pieces which are ""stiff and awkward and anatomically incorrect....clumsily painted ( Johnson reaches this conclusion by comparing him to Chardin!) and that Cezanne's reputation is really only a result of ""commerce. Johnson eye is so dead and his theories so skewed that he is obliged to excoriate virtually all art from the twentieth century onward as mere ""fashion art"" and ""higher frivolity"". Wretched history to be sure--but hardly ""new"""
3,Too wordy; not enough photos,"This guy said it best: ""All writers of single volume art histories must contend with the rightly ubiquitous and magisterial Janson and Gombrich""The bottom line is that Paul Johnson likes to be clean and crisp and controversial, and in this book he comes across as an art bigot and a Picasso hater. Plus the usual dissing of non-Western European (even Byzantine) art.But if you like controversy to spice up a subject, and if you like non-expert smart people talking about something they know nothing about (like Asimov), then this book is for you.But he is largely right (I hear from my art friends) that modern art is driven by fads."
3,One of the oddest OC albums I've encountered,"It's fascinating to discover what passed for sophisticated in 1959 as the musical sought new forms. This album is a cultural landmark, of sorts -- a show that broke a lot of barriers and paid for it with a short run. The songs have the feeling of Nichols and May improvisations. Certainly it's worth picking up for people who want complete OC collections, especially since it wasn't available in vinyl in the 1970s except for lots of cash at out-of-print record shops in Manhattan (remember them?). And you can't pass up Larry Hagman singing. Still, the score simply doesn't match up to the evident aspirations of the writers; it anticipates ""Company,"" but Sondheim's songs are so much better than the ones here. Still, there are a couple of gems, including ""Night People"" and ""A Country Gentleman."""
3,It's blue? Why is it blue?,"Ok for the price it's well made. I bought a bunch of different hats for my nephew for Christmas. He loves to where different hats and play act. It looks ok, but seriously - the parts of the hat that look silver in the picture are VERY blue. Since I got him a bunch of different hats I'll leave this one in there. Its seems ok, would have been better in silver. I guess he can be a surf viking or something."
4,Perfect for a little viking wanna-be :),"My 5 yr. old son, LOVES ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and wants to be Hiccup. This is too perfect (& not sharp, heavy, or dangerous)"
4,Fun for young boy,I was pleasantly surprized at the durability of the helmet given its low price. Fun for a boy who enjoys wearing all kinds of hats.
4,fun toy,"It is a great toy, fun, simple it allows kids to make their own characters, durable and very ell design."
2,these are not silver. they are blue,"I ordered 10 of these a few weeks. The silver helmets were fulfilled by Pretty Party Place LLC and are great. However, despite the description on these (from from Winning Costumes LLC) which says silver, they are BLUE!"
4,Birthday boy,"I bought this for my son to wear on his birthday. It was a viking theme. although the helmet was too big for my one year old, it was perfect. I even made cupcake helmets to match!"
5,For the price it was a nice tv time hat for my nephew!,"My nephew did love this hat and would wear it every time he sat down to watch ""How to Train Your Dragon"". Shipping was quick and I am very satisfied. Thank you!"
5,feel like royalty,"I love this tea tho, I'm not much of an expert this is great tea for $6 for 100 bags is an amazing deal."
5,Great quick read,"I purchased this book last week based on a recommendation from a friend. We both take the train each morning and we like to bring books that are plot-driven quick reads and this one fit the bill nicely.From start to finish there was just page after page of action that progressed the plot. There were enough characters to keep it interesting, but not to many to confuse. I love Susan, the main character. She is one heck of a gal! I even really liked the author lets us into the head of the killer... scary stuff.If you're looking for a quick read on the train, or to pass the time while your Uncle Phil is telling boring stories at your next holiday travel, I would highly recommend giving this one a try."
2,Good movie till the ending,"I agree with everyone else. The movie really worked for me until the abrupt ending. The story was realistic, the acting good. I would have given this 3-4 stars but the ending totally soured me on the movie. It was almost like they ran out of money and said ""ok..lets just finish here."" There was no resolution it just stopped. And can anyone tell me what the closeup of the discarded book left in the park by Daniel was all about in the last scene. Was that significant or meant to mean anything? I couldn't make out the title of the book so if there was a message there then I lost it....Message to director/writer/producer...if you are going to market a film as a romantic comedy then give it a definate ending...I can't see ""Notting Hill"" being the sucess it was if it had of ended when Hugh Grant rushed into the hotel for the press conference."
2,Not what it promises,Really depressing movie. It is marketed as a comedy when it's totally the opposite. Where's the funny? No truth in advertising here.
5,Saw in NY. LOVED it!,Just came back from a screening at The Quad cinemas in the village. Great movie. Funny and quirky. Strange and honest. I highly recommend it.
2,Good movie until the ending,As I watched this movie although I didn't care for the main character and what he was doing I felt compelled to keep watching. I thought the acting was well done and the story was interesting and I was anxious to see how it would end. I will not give any spoilers but I think the director must have run out of money or something and had been reading too many Stephen King novels and thought - wow I should end this movie like most of his books and just stop where I am right now. I was ready to give these movie at least 4 stars but with the ending - it really made me angry. I watched this with a group of friends and all of them agreed with me.
1,The One,"Great build up of the plot, and then it went down the drain. It started as a romantic search of love, and diverted to a self indulgence of pleasure with no regard of consequences, and left us hanging to a less than ideal outcome. The ending does not justify the title or the start of the plot. It should have been titled Me, Myself and I !"
4,No happy endings,Why do gay story lines always have to have sad endings? I was disappointed that they did re-find each other in the end.
1,ANOTHER BORING GAY MOVIE,Another mostly empty and boring gay movie. We have seen it all before.Performances are at least better than average.Better luck next time.
1,YUCK,"I just do not agree so far with the one other review. I based my decision to purchase based on this review. I watched the first two to ten minutes of the movie, and pressed eject. First scene is of a verbal exchange with the protaganist, and a gay male friend who worships people who look perfect... Seems to hate his own body, and is stereotypical of gay men in general, I found it offensive. I may give this movie another chance, but not sure when.Horrified is my response. love your body, love your cells, as GOD is not giving you another one. No wonder so many gay men and lesbians, hate their bodies, smoke, get over weight, and abuse drugs and alcohol. Sorry, just annoyed BIG TIME!"
2,Very Disappointed,"Definitely not what I was expecting. Seller should mention the fact that larger diameter Syrah and Pinot/Burgundy bottles will not fit in bags. Also, they are too short and it will be very obvious to tell what some of the bottles are which defeats the point of a blind tasting."
4,Fun for a girls weekend,"Looked at a few of these kits online and some of the others out there had bags that looked kind of cheap. Glad I bought this one instead. The bags are nice quality and the kit comes with a scoring pad that has about 35 sheets with enough lines to rate 20 wines. It also comes with a few ""playing"" tips that are helpful. My only suggestion would be to have a few more scoring pads (if you use the kit very often and/or play with large groups of people, you'll run out of paper pretty quickly). It would be easy to recreate the sheets in Microsoft Word though once you run out. In any case, a fun idea for a girls weekend or when you have friends or neighbors over!"
5,Excellent tutorial for Chinese Calligraphy...,"This book provides the basics for understanding the complex workmanship and discipline required to produce quality Chinese Calligraphy.This is an excellent book, if you are truely serious about learning this Ancient Art."
5,Blew me away: incredible fluidity,"I had the privilege of hearing Jon Nakamatsu perform a Beethoven Concerto recently and as a result, purchased this CD, loving Gershwin. I have several other versions of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, and this interpretation is the best for me. The fluid lines of play warm my heart. The humor found in the piece comes through with playful notes making me smile. The other pieces are similarly enjoyably performed. I just went on line to purchase all the rest of his albums, I liked this one so much. I can't wait until they arrive!"
2,too yellow,if a golden yellow is what you are looking for this will do it. I was seeking a whiter platinum shade.
1,0 stars!,"The box may say any shade can get blonde color, but they lied. I have dark hair, and my hair turned orange using this. I do love Feria though!!!!"
5,The Sims Life Stories,"Despite being older and not the Sims 3, I really enjoyed this game. With all the details that I gathered beforehand, there wasn't anything that I didn't know about this game. Just for those of you reading this who don't do research on your games, I will tell you this much: Vince's story must be unlocked. You have to play to at least chapter four of Riley's story before you could play as Vince. I also read all of the info at the bottom of the page, and that told me a lot. There's nothing that I would have liked to know before purchase that I hadn't already learned from the info. Not everyone reads up, though, so I suggest those who don't do so. I liked how it was possible to play in story mode or classic freestyle. The only thing was the lack of actions. When interacting with someone, I quickly ran out of different options for my actions. Otherwise, I think that this is an excellent game, and it's a shame that they don't make it anymore."
2,Do your research before you buy...,"My Dell Inspiron has trouble playing The Sims 2 (even though EA EasyInfo says I have all the components to run it), so I thought this would be a good game for my laptop. After all, the box says ""laptop-friendly.""I don't know how many times I have Ctrl+Alt+Delete to exit its frozen state since I bought it on Saturday. EasyInfo says the only thing I lack on my laptop to support the game is a bit of processing speed. But get this: I have been able to load Riley's Story once and played long enough to unlock Vincent's Story before the game froze. However, Free Mode runs perfectly fine. I don't understand how the game can work for Free Mode but not for Story Mode. It's extremely frustrating. What's more, my own desktop computer (which runs The Sims 2 and five of the expansion packs) won't run this game, and neither will my parents' desktop (which runs The Sims 2 even better than my own desktop).[...]"
5,Its Fun,This game is very fun. I have already beaten the storylines and I am now doing free play. Great buy!
5,Great! Great! Great!,"Sims Life Stories is excellent! My 2 daughters play on it for hours! I play on it my self sometimes... It also kinda explains how life is when you're older. I actually think my daughters are addicted to the game. You can create your own family, play on a family the game already has made, or play on Riley's or Vincent's Story. The two stories are directed by goals that you will have to complete. Overall it's a fun game!"
2,So...What's new?,"I purchased this at Target thinking that this was an expansion pack for the sims 2, but all you do in Life Stories is play the lives of a couple of pre-designed characters. Now, if I'm going to play the life of a character, it's going to be my own where I can decide where they are going to go. There's nothing here that I couldn't have done on the sims 2. Don't waste your money. Buy the Nightlife or Pets expansions instead."
1,Game Not interesting,"I played the game for a while, hoping it would get better, btu it didn't. It is almost the exact same thing as The Sims 2. I would reccommend buying The Sims 2 instead, it has a lot more options and is a lot more fun."
3,I was kind of disapointed in this game.,"It is like playing the plain ole sims with no expansion packs. It is fun at first til you have to go to free mode. It is easier to get from neighbor to neighbor. I was expecting new stuff in it. No cars, it's back to taxi rides."
4,Sims Life Stories PC Game,"I've enjoyed playing this game. Would have been cool if the life story of Riley had you play until her sim reached old age. The life story ends when she gets married and then lets play on free will. Overall, a fun game to play."
4,The Sim's Life Stories,Overall the game is fun to play. But I think that there should be more choices for decorating the houses.
4,Best for those with laptops....,"I got this because I just got a laptop and I wasn't sure it could handle the entire Sims 2 w/ the EPs. It's a quick way to get your Sims fix, but I recommend playing in to free play mode after trying the story mode. One cool thing is that there are no bills to pay--YAY! One bad thing is that I have yet to find a way to get new outfits into the game."
3,Good Game,This game would only be good for someone who is a beginner to the sims and had never played it before.
3,It's Ok,On both stories i got to chapter 3. There kinda fun. The game is not like the other Sims games.On free play it's fine! When your pregnant you get really hungry all the time and then you end up dyeing:( And it make my computer really slow.
3,An ok bypass,I LOVED THE SIMS 2 AND THE SIMS 3 BUT UNFORTUNATLY I COULDNT HAVE BOLTH ON MY WINDOWS 7 LAPTOP SO I UNINSTALLED THE SIMS 2 AND INSTALLED THE SIMS 3 6TH MONTHS LATER I WANTED TO PLAY THE SIMS 2 SO I WENT TO INSTALL IT WELL FOR SOME REASON WHEN YOU HAVE THE SIMS 3 INSTALLED THE SIMS 2 WONT INSTALL.So i figured hey ill get this one it looks like sims 2 but i may install.I got it and it worked but it has a little less features like no expansion packs can be added there are a limited number of people per family only 4.And the gameplay for the story mode gets repeative and it says there are two storys but there is rileys story and vinnys story you need to unlock vincents story.Also this game gets choppy after playing it for a few hours with cheat codes and all but if you had the sims 2 already you may not like but if your new to the sims and want a pc/laptop freindly game at an awsome price for 5.00 used on amazon :)
3,So-So,"I'm glad I got this game free because it's just an okay game. I was looking forward to playing it because there are goals, but it feels like it's so planned out. All the game really does is tell you what to do. I gave two stars for fun because the other sims in the game have things to say and it adds something to it...But I feel so restricted in the Riley and Vincent stories. I know there is a 'Free Play' neighborhood, but there are less objects because there are no expansion packs for it (yet, anyway). I like Sims2 Seasons so much better."
4,I like it alot!,"I got this about a year ago and I am still obsessed with it. Even if you finsih the story mode the free play is still fun. The stories in it become somewhat of a bore but once you get into it, the excitment picks up some more. This is a fun game, compared to some of the other Sims. Not a disssapointment at all."
3,Wish there was more to these games(Semi-rant),"I know this has been out for a while but I wanted to write a review anyway. I have a laptop and did not want to overpower it or install something and it not work properly. But when I read about this game I was excited to see that it would work. The stories were fun to do but when they're done it got a little bit boring. I did the free-play mode and got tired of it quick. I wish that there were some sort of add-ons for these games like the regular version. It seems that EA has all but forgotten about the ""Stories"" series. The support is not even on the site with the other Sims games it's on Yahoo and I think it may have even been removed from there. I don't regret buying it but I just wish that there was a little more to the game as stated earlier."
1,This was a waste of time and money,I bought this game not knowing that there were so many problems getting it to run. I have found online that a number of people have had problems with it. I never did get my computer to run the game so it appears I have wasted my money. It would be nice if there was a warning that there are so many glitches with this game and apparently other games by the same company. I am very disappointed.
1,Review of Rock Icons,"I have a collection of several music and concert DVD's. Rock Icons has the poorest audio and vidio quality I have ever seen on any DVD or VHS tape. It isn't worth watching even if someone gave it to you for free. Great idea, but take a pass on this one."
2,LOVE--PLATO TO THE PRESENT,"Robert E. WagonerThe Meanings of Love:An Introduction to the Philosophy of Love(Westport, CT: Praeger, 1997) 149 pagesA presentation of ideas about love from Plato and Aristotleto the present: Socrates, Kierkegaard, Kant, Sartre, Irigaray.The book is organized around six forms of love:erotic (Platonic), Christian, romantic, moral, mutual, and love as power.Wagoner has read extensively in the philosophy-of-love literature;and he presents the perspectives of several thinkers quite briefly;but he has nothing original to add to the discussion."
3,Simply Average,"Simply Magic (Simply Quartet, 3)is not one of Mary Balogh's more compelling reads. Neither the story nor the characters are particularly memorable. I could easily put the book down, and not feel the need to return to it quickly. The story is pleasant enough, and the characters are likeable, but there was not enough conflict or something to propel it forward.Mary Balogh is usually a wonderful storyteller, but this time she seemed to be on autopilot. She is a talented enough author that even her weaker efforts are still pretty good, but I would recommend reading some books on her backlist before Simply Magic."
2,Should have done her research,"At one point in this disappointing work, it is mentioned that the heroine's father killed his brother and married the brother's widow, and that such marriages, while not illegal, were frowned upon. Five minutes' research could have told the author that marrying one's deceased sibling's spouse was absolutely illegal, so illegal, in fact, that not even a civil marriage could be performed, much less a religious ceremony."
2,Not Worth the time,"I am sorry to say that it was horrible. I am a big of Mary Balogh, but this book made me want to go and kick rocks. I read it two times just to see if it would be better the second time around. It wasn't. She made to many reference to all of her other books, which made the book drag. The characters had no real substance. She could have tried harder to make the story line more complex. I'm not looking for a pulitzer prize, but not worth the time or money."
2,Greatly disapointed,"I am a huge Mary Balogh fan. I loved No Man's Mistress, and the Slightly series, Wulf was my favorite. But this story was awkward and slow. The background was revealed too slowly, so you sit there wondering why is she responding to him like that. Within the first 25 pages, I hated the supposed heroine. Her love interest appears to be a shallow wastrel who's afraid of his mother. Who want see someone fall in love with a character like that. I don't think this will be my last Mary Balogh book, but if the next book is like this, it will surely be may last."
3,Simply Magic,"Item received on on time, in good condition. A passable Balogh book, not as good as some.Linda Sheean"
1,Simply NOT,"OK, I was wrong... again. It was not about what I thought. If I had done a better job of research before I bought the book, I would have saved myself the bucks, but...Of course, I read it... I bought it and did not think to waste the money. That was also a bad decision. I have now wasted the money on the book and the time it took to read it."
1,I keep trying but it keeps getting worse,"I read 50 pages and told myself it would get better. It didn't.I told myself the pacing would pick up. It didn't.I told myself that soon the characters would blossom. They didn't.I'm over 100 pages in and nothing has happened. If I read about ""being friends"" or ""having a new friend"" once more I think I'm going to scream.I'm sorry to say that I have to abandon this read, I just can't make it through to the end. That's hard to say about a Mary Balough book as she has always been one of my favorites."
2,Simply Psychobabble,"I don't expect therapy from a romance novel. These two characters dislike each other - ""she's humorless, and prim"", and ""he's shallow and aimless."" They talk about ""having to like yourself"" - ARGH. They definitely NEED therapy. She loves him but doesn't think he loves her (yawn), and is generally disapproving of him and only reluctantly admits he is a kind man. (Whoa, hold me back!) Delusional feminist overtones (I am strong, I don't need a man, but my deepest dream is to have a husband and family...),This is a big disappoitment: dry, no chemistry, the big secret is so anticlamatic...and so much exposition instead of story - just let us live it with the characters instead of telling us everything! Read at your risk."
2,Weak story and characters,"I am a huge Balogh fan but in this particular series of books, she's batting .500. I will confess that I've bough books in her series simply to find out what has happened to characters introduced in other books (here for example, we have characters connected to the Butler family and the Bedwyns) and in this group, the books about Claudia Martin (Freyja Bedwyn's governess) and Anne Jewell/Sydnam Butler were either better written or they had nore appeal. Even though this book featured Peter, first introduced in a Summer to Remember, it just wasn't very interesting. There are plenty of reviews about the plot and characters in this book so no need to repeat that. Skip it unless you are a die hard fan or want to read the entire ""Simply"" series."
3,Good story and writing,"This is number three in the Simply Series and focuses on Susanna Osbourne. I liked the way Ms. Balogh handled the romance of Susanna and Peter but their were parts of the resolution of the ""Problem"" that did not feel right. I'm tip-toeing around the plot since I don't want to give any spoilers. Suffice it to say I enjoyed the story and writing immensely but had some disappointment."
5,Borrowed then Bought!!,"I am a late-comer to Mary Balogh's books. I especially love the Slightly and Simply series. I borrowed these books from the library but knew that these are ones that I could read over and over, so I bought them. If you like regency romances Mary Balogh's books have nicely complex characters and stories."
4,Not her best- BUT very enjoyable!,"I only started reading Mary Balogh's books last year & find them hit and miss. For me, 'Simply Magic' is a hit. I enjoyed the non-alpha hero, Whitleaf, and the ""tragic"" heroine Susannah. The story moved along nicely and I never got bored with it. Characters from previous Simply & Slightly books made brief appearances, which added to the ""enjoyability"" of the story. My only minor complaint is that I wished for more consequences for one character, whose duplicitous nature was discovered.All in all a good addition to the series."
1,Where is the Balogh Magic?,"Let me preface this review by saying that Mary Balogh is my all-time favorite Regency writer. And I have problably read about 30 of her books. No one writes wittier dialogue and compelling Regency romance better. That being said, I was greatly disappointed with ""Simply Magic.""The whole plot and premise was forced formula romance for me. Frankly, as some other reviewers have said this was boring. I did not care about the characters and I could definitely put this one down. Ms. Balogh seems to have written to satisfy a deadline and that is all. Try some of her older works. Even her ""Slightly"" series is overall a much more entertaining lot than any of the ""Simply"" series."
4,Not Your Typical Artscroll Biography,"This book is extremely well researched and well written. The author points to conflicting tendencies in Weinberg's personal letters. Shapiro points to the one's that indicate a modern-orthodox view of Weinberg, while dismissing the other letters as the one Weinberg did not actually mean. Indeed, Shapiro apologizes for not having had access to too many of the other kinds of letters which most assuredly exist."
5,The best of the Best,This product is an execellent one - If you want to tone and shape up this is a wonderful dvd to recommend to friends. It has easy steps to follow and one can get AND SEE great results. Thanks Billy BlanksYVETTE - BAHAMAS
4,Good Inspiring Workout!,"This is a great workout for those beginning Taebo. Billy talks alot about drawing on your faith for strength. The workout is not as tough as some other Taebo tapes, but I still worked up a great sweat!!"
3,a bit of a disappointment,The original refill that came with my pen wrote like a dream--best ballpoint writer I've ever had. This refill is only very good. <sigh> It does not flow as smoothly as the original equipment.
1,"Good pen, poor quality refills","I love my Waterman pen. I was given it as a Christmas present about five years ago. The black refill and came with it was perfect. When it started to die about two years in, I bought a three pack of black refills--all Waterman brand. None of those would write. I had to coax the ink out of them and often just made scratch marks on the paper. Unfortunately, I prefer that problem to the problem I have with this blue medium point refill. It is much easier to write with, but if you store it upright--like in a pocket--it will slowly leak. Usually, the leak isn't fast enough to be concerned about, but over a weekend stored in an upright position, it can build up enough ink on the tip to stain a shirt.So, I'm done with Waterman and am looking for a different brand pen with similar feel and refills that work."
1,The refills are a consistent bust,"I've owned Waterman pens for over 10 years. I enjoy the feel of the pen but the refills are a total bust. I bought a pack of 5 about 2 years ago and all have a scratchy writing quality to them that makes me feel like I'm fighting the pen to write. All of the refills in the pack were the same. After giving up on the pens for 2 years, and using Faber Castell pens, I ordered the refills again - same thing.I'm done with Watermans for good now."
3,"Mmm, what can I say..","Yes, I do like the style of Jill Jones. I reads smoothly and it is obvious Ms. Jones has done a lot of research. BUT: although the main character, Victoria, is supposed to be an FBI agent she does not always show it. There are parts in the conversation that are quite stupid. Like when they are not able to find a certain suspect: Victoria suggests he could have taken the train to the mainland or oooohhhh, he could be using an ALIAS. As if Scotland Yard doesn't know these things!! Please Ms. Jones, we are Europeans, not stupid idiots. And what a profiler Victoria is: she keeps switching suspects and getting hunches. And doesn't the FBI have a basic training in which you are able to defend yourself??"
1,Boring,I just could not get into this book. I found this story and the characters too boring to continue. I gave up on it after about 100 pages. I don't recommend this one.
3,Comment,"Beautiful voice. Vocal too close to the level of the music. Would love to have heard vocals up front. This is usually the producers fault, not the singer. Sometimes the producer gets too proud of the mix and looses the main purpose of the album. Gospel message more important than the mix. SEDUCTIVE MONROE POSE doesn't seem to go with contents of the album. Started to back space when it looked like a solo pop album. I believe a strong Christian would pass over it on the record store shelf thinking it had been misplaced. This is a constructive comment and anyone singing praises to the lord will be well rewarded in life and beyond. The album seems to be promoting the singer rather than the album content."
1,Disappointing.,"I'm a fan of Susan Ashton's Christian music, and I also like country music, so I bought this CD. I was not too impressed. Get back to your roots, Susan."
1,Favorite Artist Falls Away,"I couldn't help but notice the irony in Susan's new album titled ""Closer"". Closer to whom or what? Certainly not closer to the Lord Jesus Christ. She is getting closer to the world and its secular garbage. Look at the cover. Does her dress and pose identify her as one who desires a closer relationship with God? When I first saw it, I couldn't believe it was her. Her lyrics point people to human love which fails, instead of the love of Jesus Christ that surpasses any human love. How can anyone minister from a secular standpoint anyways? Amy Grant crossed over...how many people got saved, or were encouraged in their walk with Jesus Christ. Instead Amy Grant has pushed aside what the Bible says and has divorced and married a divorced man. What is happening to Christian music? It has become an industry rather than a ministry. It is trully a great falling away. I would not buy this!!"
3,I wish she'd go back to singing about the Lord,This is a good album but I like her first 2 best. They were poetic and heartfelt and showed her intelligence and incredible voice. The faith she sang about felt real and not pablum like a lot of other christian artists.I'm sorry she wanted to cross over.
2,Lacks depth,I have followed Susan Ashton for years. What always struck me was her choice of songs. Most of her songs were written by Wayne Kirkpatrick who is a master songwriter. He stays away from cliches which is a breath of fresh air. This album seems full of cliches and without any real meaning. Even the love songs end up being trite. Susan is a gifted writer herself and I would have loved for her to have used her skills to show us what is deep within her rather than on the surface. I was deeply disappointed.
2,Another Gospel Artist Makes the Endangered Species List,I was extremely disappointed by this album. I know almost every word to every song on every album Susan Ashton has ever done. I am a huge fan of both her musical gift and what used to be her ministry. It is becoming tiring to see yet another gifted gospel artist abandon their ministries in favor of a long-shot chance for the big monetary brass ring. The songs on this record are mediocre at best - poor reason to ditch your christian fans. Perhaps the current very poor sales of this album will cause Ms. Ashton to think twice about what actually constitutes an impressive music career. I so hope her next album is another collaboration with Wayne Kirkpatrick and his awesome songs - those two are one brilliant combination. This was most definitely not.
5,The song Lucky I love you,This her best song and she has some great ones on here to. I recomending geting this cd.
4,Excellent comtemporary C & W CD,I have not listened to Susan Ashton before. I am very impressedThis CD is certainly 'new wave' country - excellent - a couple of songs coined by Matraca Berg are included.
2,Sloppy Production,"I love Billy Blank's tae bo- but ""flex"" smacks of shoddy work. Billy is often off count, the camera is often off of him when he is saying something like ""you can also do it this way"" To top it off the instructional part of the flex DVD comes AFTER the workout, not even as a second chapter. I do NOT recommend this for beginners- not only is it a low-cardio work out with difficult to hold pilates type moves, it also may just turn you off to tae bo, and that's not necessary."
2,Didn't really make me sweat :-/,"First, I'll say I've only tried Tae Bo a couple times. I'm not an avid Tae Bo exerciser. I'm also not in the best shape either (I'm working on it though! haha).With that said, this workout was disappointing. As someone who is looking for a good cardio workout, I did not find this to be a good workout at all. I was barely sweating.Most of the DVD is stop and go because you ""flex"". I'm sorry, but that just didn't work for me. I did start sweating a little towards the end (which is why I gave it a 2), but most of the workout is stop and go, and there's no fluent cardio involved.Plus, that blonde hair girl in the front is really annoying. That has nothing to do with my scoring, but I just wanted to put that out there.I'm going to try another Tae Bo video; this one wasn't good, and I do not recommend it."
5,Good workout video!,"After getting a desk job right after college, I decided to try Tae bo. I had done it before in a dance class and loved it. I was looking for a beginner to intermediate level video, and this one was perfect. Very fun and upbeat. It does work up quite a sweat! Some of the one-footed positions are a little difficult in the beginning, but after doing them several times, you get the hang of it. Positions are probably easier for women too--as a lot of them involve extending and flexing legs. Video is about 45 minutes with about 5 minutes each of warm up and cool down. Highly recommend it! After using it about three times a week for a month, I have noticed both weight loss and stronger legs."
3,It's not that hard,"After doing advanced Tae-bo since 1998 with the original series, this workout has left me wanting something more. After doing it for a couple weeks you will find it is no longer challenging enough.While it is a great toning workout for your lower body, it is not nearly as tough as some of Billy's other workouts. It only really gets my heart rate up near the end of the workout. Sometimes when I finish I feel like I should pop in another dvd.For anyone who is at the advanced level or who is looking to burn the maximum amount of fat, I would reccommend either Tae-bo 2 - get ripped! advanced, or the Tae-bo live advanced workout.All in all, unless you are a beginner or intermediate, or out of shape and looking for something to get you in shape for the advanced workouts, skip this one."
5,great workout,"This is my first teabo video and I have to say I got hooked right away, within the first two weeks I started to see the results especially in my saddle bag area and my upper stomach! The hardest part of this video is hopping around trying to keep my balance so I make sure the hubby isn't around to laugh at me while I workout but this is so much fun I am definately buying more teabo workout videos to mix up my weekly workout routine."
2,Not challenging; only for beginners,"First let me declare my unwavering devotion to Billy Blanks and the Tae Bo program. With TB I have lost all the fat on my torso and arms, and slimmed down my legs which didn't even need it. I am a dedicated Tae Bo warrior working out with the Cardio Circuit, Fat Blasting Series, and Get Ripped Series which is the best. I encourage everyone who wants to look amazing and fall in love with their workout routine to try those tapes.... Now to Tae Bo Flex. It is absolutely not for advanced exercisers. I was frustrated through the whole thing because Billy's cuing was off in a disastrous way (not the typical erraticness), and the intensity never went up. You kept anticipating something difficult to follow but it never came. If you enjoy the videos I mentioned do not buy this one. It is only for beginners. (and beginners, if you don't like this tape, don't worry. It's not as exhilarating and innovative as the ones I've mentioned)"
1,billy blanks tae bo dvd,I thought it was big waste of time---did it once and will probably never do it again--his eralier tape swere much better
2,Too pricey. Not worth the cost.,"I was so disappointed when my book arrived. I was expecting a much thicker book. It had worn covers and looked likes used book. Way, way too pricey and not near worth the ost."
4,Everyone needs a cookbook like this....to start,"I received this book while I was still in college and living in my own apartment for the first time. I can honestly say that this book was a wonderful teacher for me as I began to learn how to cook. The handy reference pages, including a substitutions guide, were always open on my kitchen counter. The cookbook's directions are easy to follow and often the pictures illustrate certain techniques. The special photo section at the back has plenty of tasty dishes, some a bit more ambitious for the cook.Overall though, if you are looking for more exotic flavors and dishes, you should definitely expand your cookbook library out from this cookbook. The great thing about the New Cook Book is that it covers the standards in just about every category, but on the downside, some of these standards can be rather boring. Don't forget to mix it up."
1,Better Home& Gardens Anniversary Limited Edition (Loose Leaf),"I purchased this book for myself last year and never opened it until a few days ago to look up Bread Pudding recipe. I found it in the index / ref to page 252. I thumbed through to discover that page 252 was missing, along with the whole chapter. I am extremely disappointed in this book and am presently trying to find the publisher to retrieve the pages/chapter that is missing. Has anyone else experienced this with their book? I hope not, what a let down. This puts a new spin on Special Edition, its special alright. I would advise checking for missing pages as soon as it arrives."
3,SHIPPING ISSUES,"COOKBOOK WAS SHIPPED BY UPS, EITHERDURING TRANSIT OR WHEN THE DRIVERSQUISHED IT BETWEEN MY STORM DOORAND FRONT DOOR BOTH THE FRONT ANDBACK OF THE COOKBOOK WAS BROKEN FROMTHE SPLINE......I COULD NOT FILEFOR COMPENSATION AS I WAS NOT THESENDER...WHAT WHO YOU GET YOUR ITEMSTHRU"
2,"Torn, Tattered and Broken","We received our ""New Cook Book, 75th Anniversary Limited Edition"" in a timely manner. However, the condition of the book was torn, tattered, and broken. The binder of the book had tears at all four corners and in two places the cover was actually broken. Considering the amount paid for this book, we were very dissatisfied with its condition. We wrote back to the provider upon receipt, but never heard back from them. At this point we would not recommend purchasing anything in this manner."
2,"New Cook Book, 75th Anniversary Limited Edition","The book arrived with a ""ding"" on the fron cover and several pages inside were bent and damaged."
4,great cookbook,"we had an older version of this cookbook...unfortunately, it was damaged in a flood. so we had to replace it. it is a staple in our kitchen."
3,"New Cook Book, 75th Anniversary Limited Edition",Pages are thin so I can see them easily wearing with little use already. the edges are sharp and could be considered dangerous. The ACTUAL content is really well organized and the colored pictures make it easy to see what the dishes should look like...hopefully! :) Content & page design gets a 5 star but only 1.5 stars for the physical constuction. It arrived to me with tabs bent and edges curled.
5,A Very Happy Anniversary To A Great Cook Book!,"This book was given to me when I got my own apartment years ago. I used it faithfully all through the early years of my marriage too. I still refer to it as my cooking ""bible."" I think so much of it, I bought myself another one AND one for my daughter who recently got her own place. I just like the way it's put together and it's easy to understand and follow. Taught me how to keep my husband's appetite in check all these years."
1,Confused TITLES!!,"The dvd with Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull, Alice Cooper, Mountain, and so on........is called Rock Icons ""Hard Rockin"". Not Psychedelic High like advertised! It is a good thing I read some reviews before I ordered. Thanks, ans I hope this review is helpful to some people."
3,'Rock Icons - Psychedelic High' (Rhino/WEA),"Best thing this so-so compilation DVD has going for it is it's price. A solid forty-five minutes worth of vintage TV clips of the like of Canned Heat, The Byrds, Crazy World Of Arthur Brown (FIRE!), Small Faces, Keith Emerson's pre ELP band The Nice among others. Quality is about as good as can be expected. Okay, but certainly nothing to write home about."
2,Read my lip synch--Skip This,I'm so tired of lip synched material. Especially when a few great live performances are thrown in--The Byrds and The Nice. I'd rather be Youtubing than watch boring dvd's like this.
2,Two reasons to buy this DVD - Keith & Keith.,"... Most tracks are lip synced, etc. However, it does offer a rare glimps of a young Keith Moon attacking the drums and a rare glimps of a young Keith Emerson (in The Nice) attacking the piano. The Keiths are great, the rest is throw away. I'm giving one star per Keith."
4,Surprised!,"As I started reading this book my first thought was, ""oh, no, another preachy, churchy book about alcoholics"". Then I became so involved with the characters that I forgot I wasn't going to like the book. Huneven does a great job presenting ""real"" people with real emotions and feelings. I love the way she leaves some strings dangling at the end, it's not all tied up in a nice pink bow. When an author leaves openings like that, I know she is writing about ""real"" life, the way we all live it. Great book! Anxious for the next one."
5,What a thrill this cd has been for me,"I have many great jazz cds, so it his hard to excite me about new cds. This cd has sure been a welcome experience for me. It is at the top of my favorite cds list.The musicians that play on this cd are Japanese artists, but you can not tell this by the way they play this beautiful music. They are truly a bunch of great performers.The style of play on this cd is light jazz in a melodic style. The leader of this band is a pianist by the name of Shigeaki Ikeno. All the arrangements have the piano as the primary instrument, but there are solos for all the band members. The arrangements are well thought out and performed in a great way.I think this cd should be a welcome addition to anyones collection!"
3,+1/2. An odd wartime drama,"Laurence Olivier stars in this soft-edged wartime propaganda film, which sought to promote trust and understanding between the beleagured Brits and the newfound Russian allies. Olivier plays Ivan Kouzeroff, a laconic but slightly uptight Soviet engineer who is sent to Britain before the war to broker a shipmaking deal with a local shipyard. When he arrives, he's both wide-eyed and dismissive, full of preconceptions about the coldness and venality of the English. All this, naturally, goes by the wayside over time: Ivan discovers how playful and warm-hearted the British actually are, and they give him emotional shelter before the gathering storm. Not much going on in dramatic terms, but the nudge-nudge, wink-wink look at British mores, and the ""good neighbor"" propaganda elements are both kind of interesting from an historical perspective. Even though his accent's a little off, Olivier's character is completely believable and charming, in his own odd way."
3,A Curious Propaganda Film,"A curious production which starts softly as a comedy of manners, then progresses to a love story, then suddenly turns into a full-blown propaganda film. A memorial to the short-lived Soviet-British friendship.May be interesting: (1) to Olivier fans (he creates a consistent, albeit not very deep, character of an improbable Russian (being Russian myself, I know); (2) to film historians, etc.; (3) to anyone with a penchant for the weird.The acting is generally very good, the plot is quite contrived.However, the film has its moments: the playing of cello in the dark garden with the intermingling sounds of bombs and nightingales, a historic pageant, a few seconds of warmth and affection here and there.I watched it yesterday (on a DVD), on the last evening of 2008 - a strange choice, I agree."
3,cute little casio...BUT,"It sure is a cute little watch for the money...however, it is on the heavy side."
1,NOT A CD,"I tried to order this item from a marketplace seller, caiman, a few years ago, and it is NOT a CD. It's a record. Be warned!"
4,Great book very detailed,This book is really for the hard core angler. It literally teaches ground up rigging and has some very unique knots.
3,not that great,"This is pretty mediocre at picking up dust. In fairness I've only used the Swiffer duster before this one. The Swiffer picked up dust thoroughly so maybe I have too high of expectations. It's ok though since it doesn't constantly constantly cost me money to get refills like the Swiffer, and it does do a passable job."
3,short handle,"The fluffy duster is very nice but beware, the handle is only a mere 3inches long. That is very short to grab onto. Hope the 24"" duster has a longer handle."
5,molinard eau de parfum,I will be back! Thank you for a great transaction. A great eau de parfum. I had a hard time locating it..now I know where to get it!
4,"Very good for teaching fractions, only issue is it should be longer","This is a great way to teach fractions. I myself, hated learning them. My kids took to these books and got through them pretty quickly. I do wish there was more work and rather than just a few books, a longer set like the algebra set. If you hated fractions or want to give your students something they can do on their own without too much involvement from you, this is it. I would suggest adding some websites or other workbooks to really give more practice. If your student doesn't need a lot of repetition, then give these five stars. Now, the algebra set is AMAZING."
3,"Cute Idea, doesn't hold up to a teething child","We got this as a Christmas gift that hardly outlasted the season. Only the cover has a teether edge, individual pages quickly got gummed up and came apart. Our daughter loves chewing stuff, but we didn't want it to be the pages of this book. The content was fine while it lasted -- nice color concept book. Other standard board books stand up much better to our infant's adoration and abuse. This would be a much better product if each page was rimmed with tough teething material."
4,"High quality, large capacity bag","This is a very large bag, which I've had for almost six months. It can quickly get heavy if you pack it full of books and a laptop. However, it is very durable, has loads of pockets and sleeves for almost everything you would want to tote along, and fits nicely on my shoulder. The only notably missing pocket is for a water bottle."
2,not so red,"I had this exact color 120 HOT. I used to be the reddest red you've ever seen and it was so everlasting. I couldn't find max factor in stores anymore so I decided to look online. I was so happy when I found it and for a cheap price. Well the color is a light red, not quite what I was expecting. I use it as a base coat."
5,In the name of Jesus,"I love this video because it brings forth the power of the Holy spirit that is in everyone who believes in Christ. For Christians everywhere this video helps you connect the practice of building your faith up as you practice strengthening and toning your physical body! The Strength within is real for us and that strength has a name: Jesus!In addition to the spiritual aspect, I also enjoyed the music and learning the Tae Bo moves. Billy Blanks is definately inspirational and I loved the enthusiasm Shelly and the rest of the class as well. As far as level of difficulty, it does make me break a sweat but after doing the video 3 times a week for a bout a month I am looking for a video that is a bit more difficult. I would like to alternate between the Strength Within and the more difficult one for days when I feel like working out harder."
5,Good old Doc George,"I spent a majority of my childhood as a patient of Doc George. He was also my father and grandfather's doctor. These stories illuminate the way things once were in rural Illinois. My siblings and I all can recount time spent playing in the waiting room. Doc always kept a large collection of toys for his young patients. He was a wonderful man, and this book is a great reminder of the man he was. Rural Illinois couldn't have asked for a better doctor."
4,Some clarification,"This fourth edition has the Japanese word in romaji (English alphabet), followed by the word as it would normally appear (Japanese/Chinese character or kana) in Japanese. Definitions are in English, of course, but phrases showing usage are in Japanese only, with no pronunciation help for characters. This is not a beginner's dictionary, but it is much more complete, for advanced students."
4,"Thoughts on modern, popular cultural anthropology","I found this book while browsing in the anthropological section of a bookstore (where it belongs). This is a tremendously hopeful book, even if it is occasionally circular. Everything from vampire games to grafitti is explained as a recapitulation of society's previous values, just accelerated and adapted by the newest version of human--teenagers. Rushkoff deftly analyzes the existance in which young adults are operating and creating as part of a bigger, brighter reality. These anaylses are always interesting, but they occasionally seem over-thought and repetetive. This book is coherent and well-presented--the author certainly knows what he's talking about, even if the reader doesn't always agree. A wonderful, insightful book that gives credit where credit is due--to the millions of young adults who manage to operate efficiently in an increasingly complex and chaotic world, even if their parents don't get it."
2,you get what you pay for,"This item was less than half what I had seen on some other web sites. I have a set of copper Old Dutch mixing bowls and they are high quality, so I was expecting the best from this purchase. The item is ok, it is certainly nice to look at, if all you want is a decorative item. However, if you plan on actually using it, be careful because it will ding very easily, the metal is exceptionally thin, and the whistle is barely audible unless your standing in the kitchen. Again, a very pretty item, but better left for decoration."
3,A little disappointed,"This really is a beautiful kettle. I am not disappointed with how it looks. I seem to have a different problem to the other review that I read. The handle bends and the water heats really really fast. The wooden handle did not get hot, just don't touch it anywhere else. However my kettle is not whistling. There are no instructions on the point so I assume there isn't anything that I have to do to make it whistle. I live outside of the U.S. so it would be a pain to return it. If I were in the U.S. I would return it for another just like it because it really does look good."
1,Bad spot welding job,within 5 months of having this the seam in the bottom of the pot started to leak. they either poorly spot welded it or used a conductive solder because it corroded and began to leak in the bottom. I also wrote to the manufacturer and emailed them and they didn't respond so don't expect them to back their product.
1,Never Received the Product,"I originally ordered this product in November. In December I received word the product would be delayed and I would received it in February. In February, I received word the product had been discontinued and I would have to go elsewhere for the product. I believe this is very poor customer service. I had an order for three months and then Amazon was unable secure the product and I have not yet received credit on my credit card. This was a gift for my daughter-in-law and we had to go elsewhere after three months of waiting and we were late in getting her present to her. I am not a particularly happy camper. I would like to see credit applied on my credit card and In the futre, I will be more careful when ordering from Amazon when I have an occasion coming up."
5,IS THERE A DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?,"I just got this CD and to say it surpasses Moloko's debut, ""Do You Like My Tight Sweater"" is an understatement. This go round on ""I Am Not A Doctor"", Roisin Murphy's vocals are more mature and tighter than on the first release, and the production is flawless, mixing various styles together into a cohesive package that is sure to impress any funkateer, pop-fan or clubhead! Highly Recommended!"
5,Alaska Native People,"I live in The Great Land and work for the Native Health/Public Health System. I fly out to Bush Clinics in my work and this book has been a very valuable asset to me to help understand each of the major Native Cultures. For anyone who is interested in coming to Alaska, working here or those who are interested in American Native Cultures, this is a excellent book."
1,Chicago Cutlery 10 piece knife set,"I don't cook all that much,so thought I would be Ok with a basic knife set. Not so. I don't like this set at all. The knives are very dull and poor quality. I can't recommend them . I will be looking for better quality knives."
3,they're ok,"I got this knife set because I'm just beginning to cook more and it had good reviews and seemed light a good deal. The knives cut okay, not great. I was hoping the larger knives would have a serrated edge for slicing. The scissors are probably my favorite part of the set. I'm happy with the set because it only cost me 30 dollars. I'll upgrade eventually to expensive knives when I have the money. I think they're worth it for the price listed, but don't expect too much. I thought they were a little light in my hand, wish they were a little heavier."
3,Good for the price,"These are not professional knives by any means, but they are pretty good for $20! The wood block keeps them organized and safe. Plus you can always sharpen them when they get dull. They do have a nice weight to them. My mom seems pretty happy with them."
4,Great knife set for your money,I have other Chicago Cutlery we have used for 20 years. These though not as high quality as old set are almost as good. Keeps edge very well and has a nice block.
1,JUNK!,"Junk - I don't get it, the stainless steel actually has some rust spots on them. I've only had them 1 month."
1,Total Junk!!!,"Don't waste your money. I wasn't expecting the greatest knives ever, but these pieces of junk had rust spots on them after just one hand washing!! What a waste of money."
3,qual what I paid for,"as title said; its a low end chicago cutlery product- You got what you pay for, steak knifes are not sharp at all, Cheff knife is also not sharp, other two are. Caddy is good looking. I essentially paid for ""chi cutlery"" name otherwise this quality can be purchased for same amount (other brands),I have no complaint of buying two at 17.75$each but the quality is low hence 3 star for product"
2,How to tarnish a brand with one lousy product,"When you buy something that's been reduced 70 or 80 percent you know in your heart there's a reason. But if you love a deal, like I do, it's hard to resist. Despite the lousy reviews I bought these knives because just the block and the scissors were worth the price. That's why I gave this product two stars instead of one. The scissors and the block are nice. But the knives! Oy! They rust and they're dull. You wouldn't want 'em for free. Run away! Run away!"
2,Made In China,It used to be a decent brand. I was bit disappointed with the quality and sharpness. It becomes dull easy. Made in China.
1,you get what you pay for,THey are as dull as rock. The only thing good about this set is the stylish block itself.
1,Don't Bother,10 Knives for $50? A budy of mine has this set and it's horrid compared to my Shun and Wustof knives. I've had to sharpen his set twice this year for him and we still can't get them to cut like my Shun Chef's Knife.
4,Enjoyable and engaging mystery with minimal violence,"I have enjoyed all of Ms Dams' Dorothy Martin mysteries, and so was looking forward to this one. I was not disappointed. My favorite aspect of this series is the interaction between Dorothy and her husband, Alan, and this book has more of this interaction than any of its predecessors.Dorothy and her husband return to the United States pursuant to the will of an old friend of Dorothy's. Dorothy discovers that much about her former home town has changed; thus, introducing Alan to her home town involves some emotional pitfalls. The mystery is more of a backdrop to what I viewed as the main plot, the developing relationship between Alan and Dorothy. Thus, I did not mind that the mystery aspects of the plot were not particularly strong."
3,Good mystery but Dorothy should have stayed in the UK,"This mystery just didn't live up to the rest of the Dorothy Martin series. It was an entertaining mystery, but I have grown to expect more from this series. She could have gotten alot more out of the homecoming, but seemed to take the easy way out. Still, this was an enjoyable read."
1,What Happened???,"I have read and enjoyed Jeanne Dams books because I found her ""detective"" Dorthy Martin interesting in her dealings with English people. This book takes place in the United States, not England, and isn't even a good American mystery."
3,Not the best in the series...,"...but I think I enjoyed it more than the other reviewers listed here. One factor that may have played into my enjoyment is the fact that I lived in southern Indiana for quite some time (now living in Europe) so I recognized many of the locales mentioned, especially the Indiana University sites.I do have to agree with the other reviewers regarding the fact that the episodes of this series that take place in England are better than this one. I enjoy the interaction of Dorothy with the English mentality/way of life, and hope that the next book in the series returns to the UK."
3,"Worthy effort, but lacking in mystery","The first book of this series is one of my all-time favorites. Maybe that is why I had higher expectations for this installment of Dorothy Martin's adventures. Compared to the first five books in the series, Killing Cassidy is definitely the weakest.Unlike the other reviewers here, I didn't mind that Dorothy and Alan left England for America. In fact, it was a lot of fun to see Dorothy come to terms with how much her life has changed. Too bad the mystery itself was lacking.It seems like the author was more concerned with her message about healthcare and less concerned with constructing a solid mystery. The problem is, I read mysteries to be entertained and this one had me wanting to skim over the preachy parts. The supporting characters were fun, but we didn't see enough of them. Finally, the ending was too abrupt and under-explained."
5,great deal,Same as if you had bought it from Dillards. Only difference is it had a rubber cap instead of a gold one. Worth the discount!Arrived as promised.
2,Ho hum ...,"This book reminds me of a diet pill. You know the common pitch, ""if you take this vitamin, PLUS reduce your intake below maintenance calories and workout five times a week, the pill will magically cause you to lose weight."" Scheele promises to increase natural brilliance. If you follow his steps, PLUS calm down and think seeking solutions, you will amazingly find more solutions to try. For my time and money, I was disappointed in his approach. Enough said."
1,Two small,"What is the old saying, you get what you pay for. This bracelet is too small and cheap looking. This is good for a little girl about six or seven years old."
4,14K Gold Brass with decent price,"I got this bracelet for a gift and was very good, delivery was ok, quality is ok.Looks good and the price is excellent."
3,it's too small,"It looks like in the picture, but it's too small for a woman, so I think that the seller has to recomend it for girls."
5,Nice bracelet,It came a day early from what the receipt said. Fits perfect on my wrist buy first glance it is kinda small. For only 1.99 I thought it would have tarnished by now but ive had it on for about a week in the shower and everything and it still shines like brand new!! Great buy!!
1,Too small,"I think I have an average size wrist, but at 6 3/4"", this bracelet is too small for my wrist. I can't get the ends of the clasp together enough to catch. This is best for a child."
1,Gold Bracelet,"Gold Bracelet was delivered to me in plastic bag in pieces, hopefully it wont be a hassel to get a new one."
5,Great Bracelet!,This bracelet looks like real gold without the price tag to go along with it! It's supposedly brass under the gold plate which means it will still look like gold when the other wears off! Great buy and I would recommend this product to anyone.
2,Read this book and fail the CIT Exam,This book is for the old CIT exam and does not cover anything related to the new CIT Exam. There is no one to one match between this book and Amir ranjbar's CISCO Press Book. The five chapters of CISCO Book that comprises 40% of the exam questions are not even covered in this book.Do not use this book if you want to pass the CIT exam. Use Cisco Press Book by Amir Ranjbar.
3,Not bad,"This isn't a bad biography for a Jr. High or High School student. Obviously, this isn't as good as his autobiography, ""It's Not About the Bike."" My biggest complaint is that I bought it in a scholastic book catalog for use in my 4th grade class library, but some of the subject matter is too graphic for 4th graders. I was hoping it would gloss over his type of cancer, but it goes into great detail in terms of the symptoms (especially the swelling), the surgery, and the fertilization of his wife's eggs. Again, this would be great for a Jr. High student, but not a 10 year old."
4,"A very informative, but ponderous tome","I like the previous review that said this was a metric ton of a book. Yes, it is -- I carried it around for a semester when I was taking a 20th century art class. Lots of color plates and tons of black and white illustrations, and it is printed on very high quality paper (which is why it's so heavy.) It provides a good, reasonably readable survey of what was going on in art from just before the modernist movement up to almost the present day. If you want to acquaint yourself with a broad survey of modern art including all the media, this would be a good one to consider."
4,great buy for the money,"I bought this presario after much research ""Consumer Digest"" and reviews on [...]. I am not disappointed. It was easy to set up and the kids love it. I had to add a moniter 17"" acer lcd flat screen, speakers and a new printer ( my old one an HP did not work after I added DSL and the technician at HP determined it was not a software issue) But I probably didn't spend much more than $[...]. Now my 17 and 14 year old can do their homework and research at home. They also are enjoying the computer with their new media toys (ipod and digital camera) I was able to upgrade from dial up to dsl and don't know how I survived without it. My advice before you buy a new system, do your homework know what you'll be using your computer for and then go for a brand you are sure of. Also check out prices on Amazon I saved [...] buying the printer from amazon over the HP site."
3,"Great for teachers, Fair for Art 1 Students","Great for Teachers- good review. A bit fast for some Comm college students and for some reason the narrator put them to sleep. You should judge for yourself- classes/students may be different. I suggest a video that integrates in lively fashion, artists life and times with the work. This is more a ""list"" of his paintings."
3,Interesting - But Quality Of DVD Could Have Been Better,"In the history of modern art, Pablo Picasso is a nearly mythological figure. Born in Malaga, Picasso was an innovative master of various media and as one of the most prolific artists in history, creating more than 20,000 paintings, sculptures, prints, and ceramics using all kinds of materials. First famous for his pioneering role in Cubism, Picasso's art developed with a pace and energy parallel to the sweeping cultural and technological changes of the twentieth century. Unlike many artists of his caliber, Picasso was an international celebrity as well as a profoundly influential figure in the art world. His work was exhibited on countless occasions throughout his lifetime, reaching the zenith of artistic recognition with the 1971 exhibition at the Louvre, in Paris, honoring him on his 90th birthday; until then, the work of living artists had not been shown there. Accompanied by images of the artist's greatest work."
1,Disappointing..,Not worth the money or time and trouble ordering this product. I just did not like it!!!!
3,"If you're not a Malcolm fan, watch something else","The effects are cheesy, most of the acting is downright hilarious but if you're a fan of His Royal Hotness, this isnt a complete waste of time. Malcolm McDowell is dead sexy even if he hasnt shaved in a week and is boozing it up every chance he gets. The plot is convoluted and insane so only the devoted should be watching this... trust me. Sacrifice for Malcolm... :)"
5,"Fun Ride, Wierd Sea","This is a good surprise, its a strange l'l movie, but kept me entertained and intriugued. So it looks like it didn't have the most money in the world, but it kept the surprises coming and a unique SF feel. McDowel is good, Michael Pare is different (A bad guy) and that's OK Gweneth Walsh has fun with her bits. If the regular SF stuff that looks all the same and tells the same story bores you, you'l probably really like this.The female Killer Cyborg that moves like a dancer is a neat invention."
2,Who Financed This Mess?,"I think our dear Malcolm had some pretty wicked overproof in that bottle and decided to share it with the crew while this film was made. I recommend you drink plently before watching this freaky flick, too.Basically a bomb and totally incoherant, I gave it an extra star for occasional freakiness. It actually could have been a decent movie, but it just has no structure at all and genuinely makes no sense. Might be worth a peek on late night cable, but look at the price on this issue! That's about the scariest thing of all.A talking embryo floating in a bottle that talks isn't freaky enough to make it worth sitting through the rest of this film, which seems to have been made as a tax write off. Avoid!!!"
2,Not scatterless,It was not even a minute before my ferrets had their food scattered everywhere after I put this in their playpen.
5,Work great!,"These guys are wonderful. They are small and inconspicuous enough to hide, but still big enough that you can solder them without a microscope."
4,I don't mean to be rude either,"The book is quite different than what I expected, I always enjoyed Simon's comments and the way he put down those wanabees, even though it sometimes was a bit rough, I bought the book hopeing for more of his cynical arguments, but instead, he started by talking about his childhood days, how he grew up, and where he started his career, and I found that even more amazing, and interesting. It kind of gets you thinking about the options you have in life, Simon says he put off his education for a while, and he never enrolled in higher education... it was all interesting to read about.When moving towards the last chapters and into his Idol career, it gets a bit uninteresting, at least for me, I was never a great fan of American Idol, and Simon describes in a lot of details the top stars of each season and how they got there, so I was getting less interested.Overall, great read, and lot of fun stuff, as expected from Simon."
3,presenta el peligro que un exceso de erudión de historia,he leido 6 capítulos. Es un tema interesante para abordar el estudio de la historia. Para Nietzcshe la historia es indispensable pero hay que saber tener el punto de equilibrio para que sea util para la vida: demasiada historia anquilosa. La tradición tiener un limite de utilidad; el exceso mata la vida y la dinamica de la vida; pero la absoluta carencia imposibilita entender el mundo en el que se vive.
3,Not bad,The video and audio is quite good considering the time frame. These are mostly from the rockpalast or beat club tv performances. Some live some lip-sync. Not bad for the price.
5,Evolution of Capitaism,"This book is not politically oriented--not pro left or right.It's also not a conspiracy theory book. Conspiracies aren't required for what has and is occurring.It is about the evolution of Capitalism from its simple beginnings into Corporate Oligarchy, which Gross call Friendly Fascism.This book is even more relevant today than when it was written. His predictions of what would occur if his theories were correct were very accurate.This book profoundly changed my perception of modern Western civilization. It should be required reading for anyone concerned for the future of the United States and other countries with the same reliance on capitalism."
5,They take all the old jazz pop sounds and re-envent them,"I first saw Skwzbxx play at the ""Warped Tour"" in Atlanta Ga. Only about five people stud around their small stage in the far corner of the Lakewood parking lot. Which was expected because they were a Ska band at a punk concert. All I can say is that you must here their sound."
3,"WARNING: Not the size advertized, but awesome quality.","When measured, this carrier actually is only 13"" deep. BEWARE. It is not meant for anything more than a tiny tiny dog or a kitten. My cats stuck out of the back end of it trying to get in. I'm trying to transport cats on a plane and the small was the only one in the line that is ""airline approved"". It's a serious bummer. I'm trying the Aero next. Let's see how that goes.The construction quality was top notch, however - like a fine piece of luggage."
5,Great Little Bag,"This is a great little bag for the money. I had a Sherpa bag before, but it didn't provide the degree of protection as this one. This is especially true if you plan on placing the bag with pet inside under the seat in front of you. Holds its shape well even when carried with shoulder strap."
4,travel case,perfect for going on a plane. It fit perfectly under the seat and there was still some room for other stuff. I got lots of compliments on it too. My cat seemed to like it as much as any cat would like a carrying case.
2,Too Small,"This is a great quality bag, nice design but way too small for most small dogs. I have a 10 lb shih-tzu and I had to literally stuff her into the small opening at the front and even then it just wasn't long enough. If you have like a 6 lb dog perhaps this would work but anything above forget about it. I do like the quality of these bags so ended up getting the PetAboard style. The top load design is a better option in my opinion."
1,Not a safe product,"I purchased this product to take my Papillon on an airplane. I put him in it and within a minute he was panting. There wasn't enough airflow for him to be in there for a lengthy amount of time. I feared he would suffocate. I also didn't like that I couldn't see him in the carrier. He could see me but because of the double mesh that they use in this product, you can't see inside. I also think the double mesh restricts the airflow. I returned the item and bought a Sherpa pet carrier which was perfect for our trip."
4,Hardcover pocket book,"It's smaller than my son thought it would be, but my 9 year old boy absolutely devoured this book in no time. I'm sure he's going to read it several times and be looking for more books on Greek Mythology."
3,Better than most,I read Tuten's The Adventures of Mao a few years ago and didn't get it. It was just to surreal for me. This novel is far more convential. It's a love story about art and culture and redheads. Kind of reminds me of a novel of a similar theme: Still Life with Woodpecker by Tom Robbins. And as Robbins has a way with metaphor Tuten has a way with coining new words. I prefer Robbins more but this one was definitely worth the read.
2,Great CD but damaged,Bought this new from amazon as a present for my father who lives in the UK. Arrived promptly however when it arrived in the UK my father discovered that there was a scratch on the CD and one of the songs won't play. This was a new item in it's original packaging. Disappointing.
4,The best of Vince yet,This CD is wonderful after listening to High Lonsome Sound which at best was mostly an off key whine.........The songs are all very good with great harmny.I can listen to The Key several times over.......A must for all Vince Gill fans!
5,"""The Key"" is a Must Have for anyone!","Vince Gill has definitely outdone himself this time. ""The Key"" has defined the true roots of country and will be an all time classic. Vince's remarkable tenor voice brings chills to your spine throughout several selections. ""If You Ever Have Forever In Mind"" is one of the most amazing songs on the album with it's chilling harmonies and sounds. If you want a great song to get the foot tappin', just listen to ""I'll Take Texas"". It is one of the most fun and exciting selections on the album. ""The Key to Life"" is, in my opinion, the most heartfelt and inspiring songs I have ever heard. The album is also full of great vocalists such as Patty Loveless, Fatih Hill and Sonya Isaacs. I have to say that Vince has definitely let us know what the very best of country music is. This ablum is a real work of genius from Vince. This is a real ""must have"" for anyone and everyone!!!"
5,This is REAL Country,"""The Key"" is real country music. Vince Gill has captured all that is basic to this genre. Heartfelt emotions; story-telling lyrics; the right vocal line for each set of lyrics; just the right instrumentation and backup vocals to frame each unique song; and most importantly, matching his unequaled country tenor to the style of each song. For example, no vibrato in ""Hills of Caroline"", ""wrapping"" his voice around the notes of ""Kindly Keep It Country"", and the lush vocal quality of ""If You Ever Have Forever in Mind"". These are ""key"" elements to the success of this album in capturing what country music is all about.Vince Gill has done his homework well, no doubt researching the several branches of country music. He must have listened to hours of recordings and talked to dozens of what, sadly, are yesterday's musicians. By doing this, he successfully created genuine lyrics and music for these different country music types.Country artists and radio, are you listening???"
1,BEWARE OF SELLER rare_cd THIS IS A CDR!!!!,"BEWARE!!! THIS SELLER rare_cd DEALS IN ILLEGAL CDR'S. I MADE A PURCHASE IN GOOD FAITH OF THIS ASIA CD AND THIS SELLER SENT ME A COMPUTER GENERATED CDR! WHILE AMAZON SELLS SOME TITLES THEY ARE CLEARLY MARKED AND LICENSED AS AMAZON ON DEMAND CDR'S. THIS SELLER IS LIABLE TO SELL YOU A PRODUCT AS COLLECTABLE AT FULL PRICE WHILE HE MAKES THEM IN HIS HOME FOR A QUARTER. YOU CAN BURN YOUR OWN! BEWARE!!!!!! I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE ASIA WOULD TOLERATE THIS AND I HAVE EVERYTHING ASIA HAS ISSUED AND, WHILE NOT ALL HAVE THE BEST SOUND QUALITY, THIS IS ""THE ONLY ONE"" THAT CAME AS A CDR!!!! DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT BUY FROM SELLER rare_cd AS THE ONLY THING RARE IS HIS RIP-OFF TECHNIQUE!"
2,ugh,"I liked the original Newton familt better like in 1 and 2. then at 3 there is a whole different family and they make the excuse that the old newton family needed them to watch beetoven and they would pick him up at the reunion. but they dont show up so they get to ""keep"" beetoven until the next runion. i wish they just kept the original family. what about all of the puppies??"
4,beethoven's 4th,My daughter really likes this she now has the whole collection on dvd. sorry that it took so long to review this my computer has been down for awhile
2,Disappointed,I did not feel that this had lived up to the previous Beethoven's. That seems to be the case with continuations.
1,What were they thinking!,"I bought this for my three year old son. He loved it and would beg to watch it. Shame on me for not reviewing it first! It's rated G so I figured it would be fine. WRONG!! As I am driving my son to school one day (at our church), he is talking to himself in the back seat. I thought I heard him say ""What the hell?"" I blew it off thinking, certainly not, he couldn't know that phrase. A couple of days later, I walk into my bedroom where he is watching Beethoven and I was shocked to hear one of the characters saying the exact phrase ""what the hell"". And, my son repeats it again as I am standing there in shock. Needless to say, Beethoven has never been watched again."
3,Pin for Light stand,"I gave it 3 stars cause the didn't come with the detail measurements were not exact, I had to grind or shave the sharp corners down a bit to make it fit into my cowboy studio pro light stands. But it works great now. I do like it cause it's nice and heavy and made pretty solid .... in china."
4,junie continuing his techno adventures,junie from ohio players-pfunk fame puts out another synthfunk cd really if you like bread alone and the late casablanca parliament period and early zapp era should check this funk out junie was so underratedc he was prince before prince when it comes to playing all instruments.
1,Worst Book Ever,"The author of this book does little work and he basically wrote the same thing over again, ""the greatest quarterback that ever lived threw an amazing pass for a touchdown to win the game and be a hero."" no insight, barely any detail, glances over Unitas's private life. the worst."
1,Big Disappointment,"I wish this weren't the case, because I grew up idolizing Unitaas, but this book is awful! As the other reviewers have noted, it presents almost no information on Unitas. Almost the whole book revolves around the plays in various championship games. I am amazed it was published -- I haven't read a worse sports ""biography."" The only interesting part of the book was the interview with Unitas, where he described some funny things about his teammates. These are things we shuold have learned about Unitas himself."
2,not what i thought it was,"after reading these reviews, I was really excited for my New Maters of Flash vol3 to arrive. I really liked volume 1 when it came out years ago. But I ended up returning this book because I was disappointed. Most of the animation ""tricks"" here are about character animation - mostly how to use flash's drawing tools to make the characters look 3D, and how to use code to make them move. Being a motion graphics animator, the only things i found which were relevant to me (maybe 3 projects) were frankly somewhat boring and predictable.If you're an intermediate/advanced flash animator/programmer looking for really clever motion graphics tricks, there may be only 1 or 2 projects of interest here to you.If you are somewhat of a novice and want to make really cool characters and scenes in flash and become expert with the drawing tools for this type of usage, you will probably get something out of it."
3,it is better to read the Chinese scholarship,"If you read Chinese, you can find better books. A good example is Samshasha's Zhongguo Tongxingai Shilu (Chinese Homosexual Histories), available in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Samshasha's work is much richer and more substantial. Compared to Samshasha's work, this book by Bret Hinsch is really light. By the way, Samshasha's book in its first print is published many years before Bret Hinsch. The newer version of Samshasha's book, published in late 1990s, certainly surpasses Bret Hinsch much more. If you want reliable scholarhsip, do not rely on this English book only."
2,outdated already,"the book is problmatic. reason (1): it is outdated. it should be updated, when the lesbian and gay texts and contexts in the chinese socieites are so available now. it is dangerous to rely on the book, published in 1990, since so many major LGBT issues happened during the 1990s. (2) the methodology in the book is somehow simplified and naive. it does not read through the material thouroughly enough.i agree that this book has its own historic value, but we need to expect more professional works on the field.actually many good books on the field are in chinese, and they are much more reliable. interested readers should try to approach them."
2,Dissapointed!,"This book does not provide you with step-by-step instructionsfor the majority of the cuts, and I would not recommend it for a beginner student. I also expected a larger variety of hair styles."
5,Chilling and full of intrigue!,"Very few ghost documentaries out there seem to capture the ""spirit"" of strange occurances in and around Gettysburg as does this wonderful documentary. Ghost stories that fill the local inns such as the Cashtown Inn or fill the battlefields come together in an exciting hour of video. Witnesses are interviewed and offer their stories which cover things such as phantom companies appearing in a local store and ghost sightings at the Saks' Bridge are just a few of the many fun and scary stories that await you in this video from Greystone Productions. 5 Stars!!"
2,Not up to par with the other flavors!,"I think Water Sensations is the best water flavor enhancers on the market. However, I now understand why the Orange flavor hasn't been released for the general market. It basically tastes like citric acid. There is little resemblance of Orange at all. The flavor needs redeveloped. Stick to the grape and strawberry kiwi flavors."
5,I Think It's Terrific,"The orange flavor is my favorite, with lemon second favorite. I guess it's all what you're used to, but I think it's a nice, subtle, flavor. The orange flavor hasn't been taken off the market -- for some reason Amazon doesn't have it in its inventory. Until Amazon gets it back in stock, you can order it directly through the Water Sensations website. I wrote my review under the Water Sensations Lemon product, so look there to learn more!"
2,Not very blue. Looked turquoise. Had to redo with a different product.,Not very blue. Looked turquoise. Had to redo with a different product. I am only writing more to meet the minimum word requirement :).
3,Purple?,"I bought this so I could dye a strip in my hair blue for a spirit event. It was red previously and had faded out to a pink/blonde. We re-bleached it and got most of the pink out, but my hair still turned a bright purple. It even dried out purple on my friends gloves. I really like the shade of purple it turned out."
2,"bright colour, fades quickly","I bought this blue for my hair and have to keep reapplying it every month. I don't shampoo that often - once every 4-5 days, so this shouldn't fade so quickly. I think the colour is awesome, but the reapplication is pretty annoying. I wouldn't recommend this product just because it fades so quickly."
3,A book that lands on many topics but only lightly.,"This is the book for the person who wants a crash course on the game for a small fee. You get openings, tactics, endgames, and some chess history. I think you get what you pay for in this case."
3,Charges well but does not sync.,"I bought this thinking it would charge and sync my PDA with my computer, but alas, I guess you get what you pay for. The PDA does charge its battery when plugged into computer with the cable, but does not sync. I had to additionally buy a bluetooth adapter in order to sync the PDA with my computer. Overall, not a bad value considering I did need to charge my PDA using something, but description of item is deceptive."
3,Sync-N-Charge Cable,"Works well for syncing, however it doesn't charge properly. I keep getting a pop up saying that the usb can't handle the power. So instead I have to 2-step...sync first thing in the morning and then use a power connection to directly charge my Dell."
4,One of my favorites,Excellent pencil. Good quality that comes with most pental mechanical pencils. Like the retractable metal tip so it doesnt ruin my shirt pockets.
3,"OK, but...",A distance second to the best retractible pencil - a Pilot. But until Pilot's are available these Pentels are a good substitute. Worth the price versus the cheap ones everybody sells.
5,best pencil in the world,"this is by far the best pencil on the market, i have had mine since freshman year of high school, and over the last 11 years have gotten the best use from it, and though i have lost it many times in the process it has always always come back to me. I now keep it in a safe place."
5,Pencil Person,Sliding sleeve works well and consistently. Well made. Pentel really is the only place to get a good pencil. My last one lasted 20 years.
4,Great Pencil with retractable sleeve,This is a great pencil with retractable sleeve which keeps you from wasting lead by breaking it or poking holes in your clothes. If this pencil was made in metal it would be perfect.
1,The Absolute Worst!,"Being a huge fan of Hawkwind, and all of their ""Friends & relations"", and taking into consideration some of the poorly recorded material, this is the absolute worst recording, of any band, I have ever heard in my life. The sound quality makes ""Bring me the Head of Yuri Gagarin"" sound like a state of the art sonic masterpiece. Nik Turner just mumbles inaudible gibberish, and the band sound like a bunch of drunken old geezers that can't play anymore. No one in the band has a clue what song they are supposed to be playing. It truely sounds like a bunch of non-musicians grabbed some instuments and ""lets play some Hawkwind!"" then used the cheapest boom-box recorder to tape it from a distance of a half a mile away. Beyond pathetic. Even if you are a die-hard collector of everything Hawkwind, you will deeply regret this waste of time and money on this expensive item."
2,junk music,this worst piece of chap ever put out by a hawkwind new or old.no wonder captain dave brock is not on this space ride.If any thing dave take them to court for stealing the music and killing it.
3,Count your mounts,"I like the mount and look forward to using it. However, when i saw it on Amazon it showed 3 mounts and the Product Features say 2-piece mount. When i received it, there was only 1 small mount plate and 2 screws included. Either ad is very misleading or they messed up order. I am waiting for reply from Price Pros....."
4,"Good item, best price!",I tested only color cartrige. I'm glad. I will test black cartrige later when my old catrige will empty. I was amazing the price!
1,True believers rejoice!,"This book suffers from its horrible timing. Though it will still be cited and contrasted with dozens of other books and that oh so partisan 9/11 commision, this book will be used, and is needed so, by the never say die true believers who can now point to their true facts. Facts that rabid liberal George Tenet disputed. When I first saw this at the book store I thought it was a parody. Unfortunately it's not, at least not intentional. So remember to mention The Connection every time someone mentions facts instead of the higher truth."
2,Not quite there,"Wow!It's not a stretch to connect Soddam Insane with state terrorism - like using gas to kill off unwanted citizens. It is a stretch to connect him to independent terrorist groups like Al Qaida or the Contras.A much more documented connection would be Ronald Reagan and terrorism. Yes Soddam was a monster and a jerk, and gassed Iranians and Kurds with....American gas, he got from Ronalds Reagan and Rumsfield. I guess that means that besides El Salvador, Honduras, Iran, and Nicaragua, Reagan must be connected to Al Qaida. If this book is correct.If you want to connect some interesting dots, check out standdown.net"
1,Repackaged discredited information,"Hayes and his sources present nothing new here -- all of this information has been trumpeted and retrumpeted over the last two years. Inside the book he admits as much, and actually qualify some of the ""connections"" as impossible to verify, or not indicative of actual collusion between AQ and Saddam. In this, he at least steers clear of some of the more outrageous Saddam conspiracy theories. In the title, marketing, and thesis of the book, however, there is no such qualification, ever.This is a last gasp effort to bolster neoconservatives and support for a badly thought-out invasion. Publishing this now serves no other purpose, and does nothing to help us in an horrendously expensive diversion from fighting AQ."
1,Wake Up Call. . . Hardly!,"This is another attempt to link Hussien and bin Laden through tenous and improbable data. Yes, there was an Al-Qaida linked terrorist group in Iraq before his ouster, but it was in Kurdish controlled territory. It was also there to defeate Hussien. I sift through tons of data on a daily basis, and I know for a fact that Saddam Hussien did make an attempt to get bin Laden into Iraq, to assassinate him! Bin Laden had a very large price on Hussiens head as well. Sounds like they really LOVED each other, now doesn't it?"
1,"Aside from being completely false, GENIUS!","These folks never give up. Saddam Hussein, a secular Baathist dictator, is supposed to have been the ally and benefactor of the ultra-religious Bin Laden. Bin Laden hated Saddam nearly as much as he hated the US, but the notoriously paranoid Saddam is supposed to have ignored this.Post invasion we found *no* evidence of this, or of WMDs, or of a nuclear program, or a biological program, or a chemical program. None. Not even anything the far right (as opposed to the insane right) could offer up with a straight face.The ""proof"" the Bush administration claimed to have has been, where offered, proved to be false (spineless Powell's UN presentation, for example) or has not been offered, just alleged.Right-wing welfare will keep Hayes solvent. A sense of shame, did he posess one, or of decency, did he have any, should lead him to give all of his tarnished earnings to the families of the soldiers his lies helped to kill and maim."
1,never received book,Bad - I never got my book and having a hard time trying to trace it back thru this maze in amazon.
1,"What, what a waste of time!","OK, so I did get the book for free from a friend. But I took the time to read it, and I checked it against reporting since it was written. It's a huge pile of crap -- circular evidence, in which Guy 1 says something to Guy 2, who repeats it to Guy 3, who then gets cited by Guy 1. No substance whatsoever remains of the hypotheses in this thing. If there were more evidence, don't you think it would have surfaced into a huge explosion by now, given that the Iraq War is generally understood to be a tremendous blunder? If you don't agree, you probably don't think Hawaii is a state...."
1,written by a fool to be read by wingnuts,"Seriously, how could anyone take this seriously? All of its claims have been debunked. My favorite is the guy in the Iraqi army who happened to have the same name as a higher-up in Al Qaeda.Smarter wingnuts, please."
1,second rate journalist does better than government agencies?,"this book is absolute crap. i find it only slightly difficult (given the current state of the u.s. government) that a book this poorly written can piece together clues better than the fbi, cia and foreign intelligence. a desperate ploy for money from desperate people wanting an answer to why the u.s. is in iraq."
2,Sez who?,"That Saddam would use bin-Laden as a surrogate to strike at the United States is entirely plausible, however fundamental the differences between the two. The ""Prague connection"" is also plausible, despite the best efforts of Newsweek and the New York Times to muddy the waters. So Hayes is onto something here, however discomfitting it may be for those of us who oppose the war in Iraq.Unfortunately, the absence of reference notes and an index is a body-blow to the book. Without them, *The Connection* is virtually useless."
1,Pathetic attempt to sell discredited idea,"This book is so unreliable that I find it scary that anyone would give it a good review. Apparently, a number of readers have decided to engage in no critical thinking whatsoever. This book is frankly garbage. There are no footnotes or index. There is a tremendous reliance on unnamed sources. Perhaps that is because no reputable intelligence agent wanted to be associated with this book. Mr. Hayes is a neoconservative ideologue who I would not trust to write a reliable term paper for a freshman college class .The Iraq- Saddam ""connection"" has been repudiated by Colin Powell himself. Recently, it was reported that President Bush received a top secret intelligence briefing on 9-21-01 that there was no alliance between Iraq and Al-Qaeda. Not that these facts matter to the neocon reviewers of this book. Iraq is a hotbed of terrorism now because of our invasion. It was not before the war."
1,Unsubstantiated bull---- thrown against the wall,"The alleged al Qaeda connection to the 1993 WTC bombing? Comes from the discredited, disproven (by British fingerprint evidence) ravings of crackpot conspiracy theorist Laurie Mylroie.Save your money and your sanity."
5,People are so anxious to believe... Part 2,"I have an open mind and am willing to examine the evidence that Stephen Hayes presents so I ordered this book. Give credit to Hayes for his intrepidness in piecing together various threads of evidence out there, unlike a previous reviewer who pans the book because of supposedly dubious testimonies on which it is based on but then goes on to recite tired, anecdotal and conspiratorial ""well-known facts"" of less-than-dubious veracity and credulity. So I'm giving the book a tentative rating of 5 stars and will revise accordingly after reading the book."
1,Not Even Good Fiction,"Its amazing with all the resources of 911 Commission at their disposal, they could not find an operational link between Hussein and al Qaeda. If the Commission could only get the Bush/Cheney team to testify under oath, there wouldn`t even be a debate. Perhaps Hayes should spend time reading their final report which claimed there was no link between Iraq and 911.But Hayes like his other conservative peers have a gift of throwing half truth and innuendo at their faith based readers to come to ludicrous conclusions."
2,Who needs credible sources when you can just IMPLY?,"No footnotes, no credible sources, just breathless assertions.Look, I know the neokons desparately want to believe all this Saddam/Osama claptrap is true but wishing doesn't make it so.Let's look at the facts: Credible, NAMED and CONFIRMED sources clearly indicate that Saddam and Osama did not have any kind of relationship. Did al Qaeda contact Iraq? Maybe.I called Pizza Hut last week but that doesn't mean I work there.To give credit where credit is due, the book was an easy read and was at times very funny. Stephen F. Hayes knows how to shovel it like a pro but he also uses the same shovel to dig himself in deeper.Once again, the neokons are on the wrong side of things."
1,Hayes has nothing,"He could not even back up his ""facts"" against a comedian like Jon Stewart. Just wait till he gets interviewed by actual journalists. His claims are illogical, do not hold up to REAL facts (as opposed to self-serving memos by political partisans) and are frankly not worth the paper they're printed on. Trees died for this?"
1,"read imperial hubris, then, tell me about the connection.","I would like all of these reviewers, who believe the trash in this book to read one by someone, a 22 year veteran of the CIA, who makes George W. Bush look more left than John Kerry (supposedly) is. This person refutes, most vociferously, the connection; which, if any, was minor, between Saddam and Osama.Osama considers Saddam as much the ""infidel"", as a secular Middle Easterner, who's abandoned Islam, or uses it as a manner of convenience. See also the Iraq War by John Keegan. [The latter gives a pretty good overview of Iraqi history.]"
1,A pack of lies...period!,"Mr. Hayes appears intelligent on TV, but when you get into this book you find how uninformed he really is. Many un-named sources and hearsay evidence does make for a document of fact.Do not waste your time with this pack of lies. If you do read it you will know why you can buy get ""111 used & new available from $1.48."" Buy it and you'll just make it 112 available."
1,What a unfortunate book.,"This book is pretty much based on a document that has long since been discredited. The original document was written by Douglas Feith, the undersecretary of defense for policy, who headed Dick Cheney's personal intelligence group. The C.I.A, when sent the document, said it was inaccurate and was riddled with ""cherry picking"".Several points have been widely proven wrong, including the alledged meeting between Iraq and al Qaeda in Progue which is laughable.If you like this book then it's probably because it said what you wanted it to say: that there was a link between Iraq and al Qaeda, so we were right to invade them. If you took the time to compare the book to actual documents that have been released to the public you will easily see that this book is incorrect."
1,Reveiw the reviewers,"It seems to me that the reviews posted here are more politically slanted than most book reviews should be. Probably what would be most disheartening to the 5 star awarders is that so soon after publication the ""fair market"" value given to this book by the ""free market"" is as used, one cent."
1,misleading title,"This movie seems to be something that would be interesting and sexual, but is infact very boring and a big disappointment. I had to fast forward through a lot of it. Don't waste your time!!!"
4,Must-read for soccer fans,"Simply put (pun intended), this is a must-read for soccer fans. It's basically the history of soccer condensed into one book. The World Cups, the great players, the great teams, the controversies. If you are a soccer fan but don't know much about the history of the game, pick up this book."
1,"He admits, ""I have not been successful.""","On page 4, this guy says, ""And overall, though my trading career has shown many extended periods of extraordinary brilliance, the end results (at least at this moment) are that I have not been successful."" Where does this guy get off writing this book? Why would anyone follow his advice?"
2,A DISAPPOINTING BOOK FOR SURE,"This book was a complete waste of time and money for me. Poorly organized and cross referenced. For the novice, such as myself, it provided no explanation as to the types of marks to identify the makers. It did not display any marks either. There are no color photos, and what photos are found are dark and useless. I was very unhappy with this purchase."
2,"""NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!""","A great Classic Rock band but this CD doesn't do them justice. The material comes from just two albums and the live stuff is really badly recorded. Some songs sound like they were recorded in MONO not in STEREO. Get their ""SNAZ"" live album instead. Much, much better than this CD. The other songs are studio tracks from their ""BOGALOO"" release in '99. Not my favorite by far. For a complete Nazareth collection, I would also recommend getting the ""Heavy Metal"" soundtrack. It has one of my favorite Nazareth songs on it---""Crazy (A suitable case for treatment)""."
5,Tin Can Papermaking: Recycle for Earth and Art,This is one of the best books for a beginner. The steps shown are very easy to follow.The cost for materials is minimum. I was able to make some very nice homemade paper with just the things I had in my home.The book is well worth the money. Happy papermaking.
4,Good as their casserole dish?,I just ordered two. Hope they're as good a their casserole pan. Will report back when they arrive.
5,Very Interesting,"The selection of recorded works is great both on the audio side and as a matter of musical interest. There are several interesting musicians introduced on this CD that i would never have known about, Rossana and Zelia, for example.I have the XLO disc and the Shefield disc, both of which carry cuts from their respective catalog of discs. This CD has music from many sources.Bottom Line: There are plenty of test CDS around. This one offers great new music to listen to."
2,"BonJour Chateau Deluxe Tabletop Wine Opener, Black","I experienced the same problem as reviewer number 2. Rather than pulling the cork, it pushes the cork into the (expensive) wine, splashing the wine on table, chairs, and clothing. I am not happy. Tried to return item, no record!"
1,I was very embarrassed,"I gave this wine opener as a gift to my husband for Christmas. He also received a handheld wine opener of a different brand from his father. Besides the fact that a piece broke off the second time we used it, it wasn't able to fit many of our bottles of wine because it wasn't tall enough, and out of three bottles we opened with it, it pushed the cork down into one of the bottles. When comparing the weight and sturdiness of the opener my father-in-law got my husband and the one I got, there was no comparison. Mine felt like I picked it up at the dollar store."
1,cheaply constructed,They built the main support beam and fastening joint with cheap plastic. Broke literally the first time I used it. Am sending it back.
1,DO NOT BUY - Flimsy materials and horrible design.,"This product cost $50, and felt like something I'd purchase at a 99cent store. The handle flexes when you hold it, and the corkscrew is cheap and flimsy. I bought this as a gift, and I'm glad I opened it to inspect for shipping damage, because I saw the quality and immediately returned the item at my own shipping cost. I would never give such shoddy product as a gift."
1,A cheap and fragile product that broke,"We got one of these as a gift. My wife set it up at a small get together and one of our guests immediately broke it.Then I went to the in-laws house, and they had the same one, in a box, unused. I tried to set it up, and it broke upon assembly! That's two broken openers before a bottle even got opened. They broke it two different ways, too. It has numerous fragile plastic parts that are so thin they can't possibly survive much use. I managed to open a couple bottles with it, but it doesn't work well."
5,What is there to say?,"This is a collection of the R's hits.If you are an R. Kelly fan, well then yeah you are going to enjoy the album.Enough said...Later...."
1,I hate him,He sounds like he is kissing someone i mean he is weird i hate him. he should go to school to learn how do be a gentlemen instead of kissing 13 girls
5,The CD is tight but...,"Personally, I think the cd is tight. It really takes me back. However, I also feel that some songs that should be on there were left out. The song that I wanted to be on there the most was ""Feelin' on Yo Booty.""That song,in my opinion was definitely one of his greatest hits.Oh well, hopefully it'll be on Vol.2"
1,edited versions?!?!,i don't have much issue w/ the song choices themselves...but why did htey issue the edited versions of the songs. do people honestly enjoy randomly 2 second silences in the middle of tracks?!?!
3,R.Kelly/R&B Collection,"Don't get me wrong,R.Kelly is the best R&B artist of today vocally and musically without a doubt,period.But...this album is a greatest hits CD.Hits don't necessarily mean greatest.I guess if you don't have his other stuff and want a taste of his music this is for you.There's two new songs that are pretty decent.But ultimately I don't think it's time for a ""best of""collection until your planning a new career."
2,not worth it,"I have been an R. Kelly fan since 12 play. I have all the maxi and albums.So when I saw the track listing of this new greatest hits, I was not impressed.Plus I hate that new song that's on the radio right now, and the video to that song is WACCCCK! So... I haven't listened to this new CD. I don't care for it.Only if the DVD of the video collection came with it, but too bad, they are sold seperately!"
3,Who wants the CLEAN VERISON?? I DIDNT!!!,"I brought the R in the R&B cd on Super Tuesday. I thought why not add to the collection. I wasn't gonna get the CD, but I said what the hay. I finally popped the cd in and noticed that some of the words were missing or edited out. I was very disappointed. I want to hear it like I would on the original album. Come to find out that all the cd's are edited. I wish that I had notice before, not even a sticker saying CLEAN. I would have never brought the album. I didn't want the CLEAN Version. JIVE and R Kelly-notice for the next album. Be like everyone else and put out a CLEAN and a Parental Advisory Album.Collection overall was OK! I thought some other songs should have made the cd."
3,Great album BUT...A HUGE FLAW,"Everysong on this album is great, R Kelly has such a unique and solid sound. All his hits are here, everything from Bump & Grind to I Wish. BUT there is one huge problem, these are all the clean versions of the songs. Each song contains all the annoying skips and silences. Its so irritaing, like listening to a scratched CD. WHY didnt they release an explicit version like all of his other albums? If you can get over the skips and pauses due to the edits, then this is a great buy. but as for me i would rather just make my own mix with the albums i own."
3,Half a Loaf,"A model for this book might have been Donald R. Hickey's ""The War of 1812: A Short History."" In ""The War of 1812,"" Hickey summarizes both the political and military battles of the War of 1812 concisely and elegantly, leaving the reader with a clear view of the issues. Eisenhower's book fails in this regard.Neither an in-depth look at the battles, nor a political history of the war, the book is an uncomfortable blend that never quite makes it on any level. There are some surprising omissions here (Where exactly were the borders of Texas at the beginning of the war? Why did Polk allow Santa Anna back into Mexico?), and ""continuity"" often seems amiss. Detailed descriptions end suddenly and awkward three sentence paragraphs appear, as if the editors were uncertain how to proceed. The book is ""half a loaf"" and readers interested in specific topics (the politics, cultural impacts or the battles) would be better off looking elswhere."
4,So far from god the war with Mexico excellent read,I found John Eisenhower book a great read from both sides of the war. There are so many things Hollywood dosent have the time or just dosent care to put in movies. I soon figured out the Mexican army and people were not COMPLETLEY in the wrong.
4,"I Have Had This PC For Over 5 Years, Works Great but Slow","I have had this computer for a very long time up to 5 years and still going strong on some occasions. Soon I will have to break away from this PC and get something new with a new OS. I like it cause it has capabilities to get my internet surfing, playing music, making videos, and collecting personal photos and documents. I had to stick 2 GB of RAM in the slots cause 512 Megs was not cutting it enough for my multitasking. It's a great beginners computer so I may give it to my girl friend after I get another PC in the future. It has an excellent graphics chip for the monitor and I may get an LCD monitor to get the most out of the graphics chipset. I am still sometimes having issues with the printer drivers, and some other drivers, but still it's an ok PC. Right now this PC has been discontinued, but someone may sell theirs here."
3,Not for brand new beginners to Yoga,"I have never done Yoga before, and thought this would be a great way to start, but I was wrong. Though the instructor is very helpful, and does a great job of explaning the moves, I had to keep bouncing all over the place so I continue to crane my neck and look up to see exactly what she was doing. After about 10 minutes of this, my neck was killing me, so I stopped. I would recommend learning the basic Yoga moves before doing any kind of tape. That way, you don't need to see the TV the entire time! I liked this tape, and plan on using it, only after I take a class first."
2,FOR BEGINNING BEGINNERS ONLY!!!,"Well, I guess I should've read more reviews of this DVD. It is STRICTLY for beginners. I don't sweat and my heart rate barely goes up (if I do breath of fire it helps). When I want an easy day I'll pop this in and do both sessions. Very simple. But I'm sure it's good for a beginner--a BEGINNING BEGINNER. Sara Ivanhoe is soothing though, and encouraging. But seriously, this is a very easy workout."
4,Excellent mix of workouts,I am in love with the Crunch series. I haven't found one I don't like. They walk you through the items and make you really comfortable. I like that its not a weird beachy scene with someone who seems like they are in a trance. I highly recommend.
4,Good workout,"If you like yoga, then this is a great workout. It's not too extreme, and the moves are easy to copy."
4,Yoga that makes you sweat,"I purchased this dvd a couple years ago and it's a great workout for yoga beginners. The poses may seem easy but don't be fooled! After a couple seconds of holding these poses, you start to sweat! That's a good thing though because it means it's working. The poses are very do-able but in the same breath they challenge your body--you WILL feel it afterwards--in a good way! It's also perfectly narrated to follow along easily. On the days I don't feel like doing a strenuous workout, I bust this dvd out. You obviously won't burn as much fat doing this as you would doing--say, P90--but it's better than not doing anything at all! It's an awesome yoga workout for your whole body and you are SO relaxed by the time the dvd is done. Give it a try. Namaste!"
4,Good beginner yoga,"Both Crunch -""Joy of Yoga"" and -""Fat Burning yoga"" are great beginner yoga videos. They are paced slow enough to keep up, and provide useful stretching poses. I also have Crunch ""Body Sculpting Yoga"" and I would say that it provides are more complete full-body workout."
4,Satisfied Customer,"I enjoy this DVD, and I am a skeptic of workout tapes. I know yoga terminology so it was easy to follow and do the postures correctly. I suspect if one was just beginning that the poses would not be clear and it would be necessary to do some outside research on how to do them properly.Having written that, if you have some basic knowledge then the DVD's are great. There are levels to work up to and Sara is a good leader. There's also an extra ab work out. I'm going to buy more Crunch DVD's. It's fun."
3,Excellent For Beginners,"This DVD, along with the CRUNCH Candelight Yoga DVD, was the first Yoga DVD I bought. I had never done a Yoga class before so was clueless on the poses and breathing techniques. Being that I am fairly athletic, within 2 months of 3 times a week I needed to find something more advanced. I would recommend this DVD to anyone just starting out as her voice is wonderful to follow and she explains everything thoroughly. After that, the MTV series seems to be a good next step (at least for me)."
3,Fat burning? Not really,"This DVD comes with two workouts: Joy of Yoga and Fat Burning Yoga.If you are one of those whose attention was caught by the title of this DVD ""Fat Burning Yoga"", well, let me tell you you will be disappointed in this one. The Fat Burning workout runs a little over half an hour, which essentially makes it ineffective in burning fat. This is not to say that it's not a good yoga workout, it's just that when you feel like you *just* got started, the routine has ended. If you are looking for a short yoga workout which will make you sweat a little, you will be happy with this one. It's easy but challenging enough for someone in the beginner's level and Sarah is a great instructor. She has a soothing voice and she clearly love what she does.The other workout routine, the Joy of Yoga, is a good introduction to yoga. However, you may get bored of that one quickly though."
3,Good,"This is good for stretching, balancing, and gaining a little strength. The Joy of Yoga is relaxing, and the Fat Burning Yoga is more for stability and flexibility. Pretty easy, but ok once a week."
2,Relatively boring and slow,"I bought this dvd together with the two mtv yoga dvds - i find the mtv yoga much better. Crunch's yoga is not very challenging (even though i'm a relative beginner), the instructor is ok, but can do with fewer pretenses that she's working really hard and fewer of her unnecessary encouragements. Unless you are absolute beginner and have never attended even one yoga class, you'd hardly find it challenging or interesting. By MTV yoga instead."
1,this workout is to yoga what cliffnotes are to literature,"This workout uses yoga vocabulary, but it's really just gymnastics. That said, it's not really interesting gymnastics. The instructors talk too much, by the fourth time you're bored as anything and want to just get on with the workout instead of listening to them. For people interested in more serious yoga AND a really good workout, check out the Flow Series."
3,"Okay, but not great","I bought this dvd on recommendation of a yogilates class teacher, and was a little disappointed. I have been doing yoga for several years now, and found this dvd to be too simple. The triangle/warrior positions didn't flow very well, and the instructor's insistence on pronouncing the word forward as ""foward"" drove me crazy.Even though this dvd was simple, the twisting poses were rather difficult for me. This is probably because I hadn't done many before, so it is a good introduction to those. I did this with a friend once, and he kept falling down, and really had a tough time with it, probably because he hadn't done yoga before and is very inflexible.It is nice to have two options for a workout on one dvd- really takes advantage of the extra space afforded by a dvd over a vhs workout."
4,Great!,"I have used this DVD for about 5 years now. It is a nice yoga flow sequence with some burn. At the end of the exercises I feel like I have done a work out. She does get annoying after 5 years... so I did buy a few other DVDs to change it up, but I always go back to this workout.The fat burning yoga one is the one I generally do as there is more muscle type work involved. The other set is slower and good for a more medatative/breathing yoga.I am a 23 year old female, in relatively good shape but a beginner in exercising."
4,Great for beginners,"I am new to yoga and thought both of these were great. I don't know how much calories they actually burn, but for me, they are fantastic for my days ""off"" or when I want to take it easy. I really liked the instructor."
5,Great workout and stress reducer,"This is an excellent yoga set. Sara Ivanhoe is very likeable and has a soothing voice. The music is beautiful. Both workouts in this set will make you sweat. It is great for beginners, but by no means is it slow or boring. The Fat Burning yoga section moves quickly and you're never hanging out in one pose for too long, so time passes quickly!I was sceptical before I purchased this set, due to the fact that most yoga videos I have seen are boring and don't seem like much of a workout. I have experienced serious toning in my legs, as well as an amazing sense of well-being since I've been doing this yoga set."
3,Too easy if you're an intermediate,"I keep this DVD in my collection because it works well for a ""light"" yoga workout at the end of a long day. However, if you've practiced yoga for over a year, this video will be too simple for you if you're looking for a real challenge."
2,"Fat Burning, No.","I bought this dvd wanting to expand my yoga library at home. I found it to be very, very slow and agree with those that say Ms Ivanhoe ""talks down"". I would have to say that this video is definitely for someone who has NEVER done yoga. I hardly work up a sweat at all and find my mind wandering as Ms Ivanhoe overexplains a pose. DO NOT purchase this if you have much yoga experience at all!"
4,super yoga workouts,"great instructor, beginner level, great workouts. really nice to have 2 options. I really enjoy the fat burning yoga."
3,Aerobic class tone,"Some people love very spiritual yoga; they love the meditation, the chanting, etc. On the other end of the spectrum, some people are looking for new ways to get fit, and enjoy yoga as the newest workout at the gym. This video is firmly for the latter. The instructors are perky...perhaps too perky. If you prefer to avoid any hint of a spiritual practice, this may be the DVD for you. If you feel a little weird doing yoga with an aerobic-instructor tone, you'd probably like something else."
5,Comforting Teaching Style,"Sara Ivanhoe has a fresh radiant energy and a comforting teaching style. She believes that if it isn't fun, you won't do it. Her energy is like orange zest for the soul. You can safely relax into her workouts and let her instruction take you to relaxation. The Fat Burning workout on this DVD is especially enjoyable.The setting is a gym with wooden floors and lavender mats. All the traditional Yoga moves are here: Downward Dog, Chair and Warrior. What makes them more enjoyable is how Sara Ivanhoe arranges the poses so they flow together in a beautiful sequence.If you are intermediate and are looking for a way to burn more calories during your Yoga sessions, then the Fat Burning segment may impress you. Normally I walk, bike or dance before doing yoga, but with this session, you may want to save your energy and just head straight into the practice. I can also highly recommend the Crunch Candlelight Yoga DVD and all of the 20-minute Yoga Makeover DVDs.~The Rebecca Review"
4,Never thought I would get a workout with Yoga,These workout routines really make you work your body. They help not only get better control of your muscles but also help strengthen and improve flexibilty.
2,Below average DVD,"The asanas are average or below average, Joy of Yoga does jump into standing back twists, thereby being a sudden testing on limit. Recommended to those active in form of exercises like Yoga or Aerobics, not Jogging and so on.Level: Advanced(With Warmups on their own)Instructions: SpokenModifications: Yes, ShownLocation: StudioDuration: ~45 minutes"
5,Yoga fun,"If you like Yoga, this is the DVD for you. Sara Ivanhoe is an excellent teacher. One DVD is regular Yoga, and the other is more upbeat."
5,Great for Beginners!,"I think that this video is great for beginners. I am a new student (2 months of practice) and I found that the repetitions and then flow was just right for me. A more advanced person may find this boring, but maybe not. I'm sure this DVD will be included in my rotation.(I do think the relaxation period should be a bit longer)"
5,Nice Blessing Flugelhorn mouthpiece,"I have played my flugelhorn which is a Couesnon flugelhorn from 1969, with the Blessing MPC 3FL several weeks now and have been pleased with the overall performance I am getting. Response is easy and no hard work to slur an octave or up a scale. Like I said in my my other review of the Blessing 3C cornet mouthpiece and the Blessing 3C trumpet mouthpiece all are fine quality additions to my brass mouthpiece collection and are fun to play because the cost of the Blessing are very economical and ,since most new trumpets are priced at two thousand and up, a new mouthpiece is an easy way to upgrade my brass instrument playing.I would recommend any brass player get a Blessing mouthpiece for your horn. I gave the Blessing 3CFL mouthpiece 5 stars because when performance and price are considered Blessing is 5 star worthy."
3,Swatch Windfall,The time piece is heavy and looks sharp but the chain is hollow and the black thing on the chain is rubber not steal. If it breaks the whole chain will come apart. I am dissapointed.
5,Nice watch,"Thanks for the product, the time ok, but i want to know if you can send me the document of warranty by e-mail."
4,swatch windfall,"the watch was ok but the case which came with it was broken. I don't know whether it was sent broken or it was broken while on transit. but over all experience, the watch is ok."
3,"Good looking watch, but band can break.","I have own this watch since 2006. It is a good looking watch, but I have the plastic part of the wrist band broken twice now. I had it fixed twice by replacing sections of the band. Now, it has broken again. I won't have it fix any more since it will just be breaking again in about another year's time. I suggest you should consider a watch with stronger wrist band that's made with all metal parts. The plastic is just not good enough. I think it is a bad design on swatch's part."
1,Wrong description!!!,"The only reason why I've bought this outdated item was the aluminum case and band (as mentioned in description) . This is completely WRONG!!! Both product information and product description lie to buyers. This watch has heavy stainless steel case and band.Amazon should not provide its marketplace to sellers, who are not able to describe their products correctly!!!"
3,BAND - Unband,Must agree - its a great looking watch. i got this a couple of years back - could not wear it enough due to the plastic band connectors in between breaking too frequently. i am surprized how such a design flaw was overlooked. the connectors are just not good enough to be intact. does anybody know if Swatch could be contacted for a solution?
5,Golf Instruction,"This was a book found in Ben Hogan's personal library when he died. Most believe this played a part in his golf game. Super great book on how to relax under the most pressure, I feel he read this book his whole golfing life. Tom Dodson "" Hogan "" said he was well read. This book is listed in Dodson's bibliography written in 1945, Tulsa, OK. Sincerely, Carl Welty"
3,More than Meets the Eye,"The Film Broadcast Bombshells contains some very funny moments, equal to anything Mel Brooks has produced in years. Under the guise of a T&A film, Bombshells presents funny Dominatrix bits, news parodies and a hilliarious send up of a local telethon featuring a trenchent E.S.T/Tony Robbins self help guru who promisses to change people's lives with just three little words. Wrapped in the technical limitations of your standard T&A faire one has to look beyond the film's limitations to find a very funny, creative and unique idea. END"
2,only the first five minutes,"This movie was dumb;REALLY DUMB!The only part worth watching is the first five minutes where the brunette bombshell is riding that stupid news anchor guy...........other than that,it [was bad].If you're going to buy this movie,don't pay [too much] or you'll hate yourself."
4,strong and an excellent hook,"I bought these to hang up a whiteboard for a projection screen, they hold that weight and could hold much more. I put one of these on my fridge and it took a lot of pull to even get it off.I would have given it a 5, if the hook itself was a little bigger, but this is not really a draw back, just something I would have liked to seen for my usage."
2,Magnet not what Amazon originally pictured,"The day I ordered this the item that was pictured was a sturdy but stylish oval hook magnet. What arrived, and what is pictured for the item today, is a round magnet exactly what I bought for $2 at Lowe's and for which I already own a dozen. Total with shipping is $6.14 for an item I rejected and wanted to replace. What a bait and switch. If it hadn't been for the picture changing between when I ordered and today, I wouldn't be as upset."
5,Strong!,I ordered this magnet to secure an extension cord running from my garage door opener on the ceiling to the outlet outside. It adheres strongly to the metal garage wall and holds the cord nicely.
2,bait & switch,"Just like another reviewer said, When I ordered this the item, the picture was different. The picture I based my purchase on was a set of TWO stylish oval hook magnets. The actual product was not what I wanted- the hook itself is small, sharp on the edge, and not functional for what I intended to use it for. Not to mention the fact that it is one, not two magnets as originally pictured. Way too expensive for one magnet!"
5,Great for fathers!,"This is the best book that I've ever read on this very important subject. Now, more than ever fathers are as involved with their children's upbringing as Ms. Lipper points out in her eloquent book. We form an intimacy link with our children. They are our most precious resources. Every parent in America should read this book!"
4,Narrated slide show with biography & work analysis,"This documentary presents hundreds of works by the artist. It is a narrated slide show. The commentary is very detailed, competent, and comprehensive. It includes extensive biography mixed with a very professional painting analysis encompassing influence of other artists with examples of their works. The quality of video and sound is good."
2,Dull Work on an Unusual Painter,"This work teaches the viewer about the anti-Semitic discrimination that Chagall and his family faced in Russia. It speaks of how his work differed from the surreal art of Western Europe. It even proved that no all of his work, especially earlier productions, were surreal.Still, this was a somewhat dull art lecture just put on a DVD. I think high school art students would not pay attention to it if their teachers spent a class period showing it. Most viewers will not want to sit through slide after slide and hear babble after babble. This may only be for hardcore Chagall fans or those who want to learn more about a potential idol."
3,Love the product...took too long to get!,"We LOVE giving these as gifts at Christmas. We love smashing one at either Christmas or New Year's . It is a wonderful tradition and the peppermint is really good.However, it took TOO long to ship and almost missed Christmas to give as gifts to friends and neighbors - the product I give a 5 - the shipper I give a 2."
2,The porker flopped,"Beware the pig.....I bought these as a cutesy gift for Xmas presents for my children. They were not that great frankly. The packaging was not great, the pig was small, and he didn't taste that good. My advice is to pass on this one. There were some chocolate voodoo dolls that went over a lot better, were more fun, and tasted better so my advice would be to get those over this item."
4,good mixture of choral cinema music,"Good collection of tracks, nicely performed, but not as good as Cinema Choral Classics I, which is 5-star."
3,A Strong Story,"Devra and Mitch are madly in love. That is until they find they are related. Devra goes to Connecticut to start a new life. Mitch goes to a evil gold digger named Mona. Devra becomes haunted by dreams that seem to be actual events. She also learns they are not related. Can she get him back from Mona?This book has a strong story but is lacking in the mechanics. The story will keep you going, but it is a rough road.Recommendation: NOT REALLY RECOMMENDEDTim Hancock is the Director of MWLA, a reviewer and an Author"
5,Wedding earrings,My daughter was married last June. Her them was polka dots and bows. She wore these earrings on her wedding day. Great quality. Great memories and now are a keepsake.
1,uncomfortable,uncomfortable and tacky looking. It wasn't enough of a difference to deal with the discomfort.
2,What's the point of this book?,"I live on Mt. Desert Island so I guess I'm not captivated by Mr. Sterba's anthropological examination of his brief stays each year on MDI. I read the book while traveling to capture that 'sense of place' I was missing while away from MDI. That's about the only thing I find captivating about the book.There is no apparent organization to the rambling narrative which touches on wealthy but non-ostentatious 'summer people' and the 'quaint ways' of the locals. Random observations, lots of words in 'quotes'...kind of irritating. A few factual errors about directions and where things are located (surprising for a reporter) won't bother the average reader.I found the book disorganized and saccharin, but I'm happy that Mr. Sterba is happy."
1,broke in 10 mins,Broke in the first 10 minutes. I'm going to buy one more because I'm a sucker....and can't find them anywhere else. Hopefully this one is better
1,What a rip off!,"OMG I am so Piffed!! I paid $7 for a stupid pamphlet. It's, like, 20 pages worth of info. The best thing out of it was the daads dot come website to pass to my fiance (I bought this for him). What a total rip off :o/"
3,wish it was 1990 again,mc trouble was'nt bad she was a good rapper and singer she would have been greater if she lived. classic old school rap album if you like rap from this era I still do.
5,glitch heaven,"i must admit, i was a bit worried at first about this disc. i'd only heard of them because of some remixes they'd done of bjork's ""all is full of love"" and at the time i did not like their remixes, but i figured ..., just give it a shot. and i'm SO glad that i did. they do an amazing job of changing up how a song sounds, while still keeping the overall feel of it the same. they've really opened up my ears to new types of music, especially the more avant garde. and because of this disc i was able to go back to their bjork mixes and truly appreciate them for all that they are. just listen to them with an open mind to what music can be and ears wide open. you won't leave unhappy."
4,Works well,"This crazy thing works pretty well! Just make sure people at a party are able to operate it after celebrating a bit. Good entertainment watching someone try to figure it out! Its not made of steel, but it works great."
3,other reviews have it right,"i too found this as a nice change of pace, and its continuous, yet a little less than im used to with tae bo, i prefer the advanced which really doesnt give you any rest period and keeps you trying harder to keep up without pause. nice change of pace, i use this to work in with other tae bo if i dont feel ive gotton enough on some days, or for a faster and more laid back work out than im used to. those beginning out with tae bo or work out in general will find this a struggle to some degree."
2,not so great,"if your use to all of the other workouts that billy offers you will not enjoy ths dvd. it is slower paced and you don't work as hard. i did this video for thirty minutes then did the advanced workout after just to feel like i worked out. if you like to sweat you wil with cardio but not until the very end so you might as well do it twice. i do not recomend this dvd but i do recommend his other dvds taebo ripped, taebo abs and butt, taebo advanced. billy is a great instructer but this dvd sucks"
5,Excellent Cardio workout,I have a lot of the Tae bo videos... this is one of the best ones in my opinon. Not an easy one to master. You will get a great wrokout!
5,great workout video,This video is a fun cardio workout with interesting moves that are challenging but not impossible. Billy Blanks is a motivating trainer and when you're feeling tired he always has an encouraging word.
2,I might as well walk in place,"Ok, so I have been an avid Tae Boer for the past 3 years and I have to say I bought this almost a year ago, thinking it was a pure 60 min cardio workout. When in reality it is definatley BASIC. I think this is good for people who are bran new to Tae Bo. Or even for Pregnant women. I didnt even break a sweat doing this workout. I own the Get Ripped workouts and they are definately high endurance...But like I said if you are already advanced in workout tapes, I do not recommend this workout. If you are new to any type of workout- Definately try this one first! But its just sitting on my shelf, collecting dust~"
3,Eh...,"I'm traveling quite a bit, so I like to buy work out DVDs for my laptop. I bought this one, to try something aside from Pilates, Yoga, Aerobics, and basically the whole Denise Austin genre... Unfortunately, I found this workout a lot harder, not in the cardio sense, but in the choreograghy. I guess maybe it's something that will come in time, but I add another workout to this DVD just to be sure I am getting a good enough workout.Basically what I am saying is that if you are horribly ungraceful and a slow learner when it comes to physical things, then you might want to opt for something else."
2,Boring,"I am glad I rented this from the library and didn't pay for it. After 10 minutes I kept checking the time to see when the boredom would be over with. The workout is okay, but I never felt challenged except in my ability to put up with the background exercisers counting 1-8 throughout the ENTIRE workout. I've done the original Tae Bo a few times and definitely felt more challenged and the time went very quickly when I did it. This workout also seems to ""forget"" to work both sides of the body evenly with less repeitions on one side or completely leaving out certain exercises when they switch to the other side. Very disappointing, rent it from your local library, don't buy it, if you want to do this workout. the one good use for this video is to teach your kids to count to eight."
2,Way too fast for beginners!,"I have never ever seen a Tae-Bo video or class before. I thought this video would get me into the loop, based on other reviews here (they all complain that it is for beginners). Well, let me tell you, it is waaaaaay too fast for beginners. Billy doesn't teach you any of the moves - he just does them (and does them fast). I couldn't even keep up wth the warmup portion at the beginning. The counts of eight take like 4 seconds, and his arms are swinging on every count. I know this is supposed to be a really fast-paced cardio workout to get the heart pumping, but I cannot even keep in synch because I'm trying to learn the moves at a ripping fast pace - it is very frustrating."
5,TAEBO CARDIO,"I LOVE Billy. His videos is gaged for all levels of fitness and yes, I like this DVD as well.ADVANCE TB FANS....check out ""TAEBO ULTIMATE ABS/BUTT"". I own both DVD'S and right now, I'm only observing ""TAEBO ULTIMATE ABS/BUTT"" - (not participating). This DVD is a challenged which is dam near ""non stop"", kicking your butt from start to finish.BEGINNERS TB FANS: check out ""TAEBO - FOUNDATION"" to learn proper form and technique before taking on ANY challenge. You'll be thanking yourself later. :-)"
4,Thank God for Taebo,"I am a working mom of 2, married, and have no time for anything.I used to dance in the early days and it's been a while since any form of exercice. I purchased the dvd taebo cardio and I believe it's great for those starting back up the fitness train. It's mild and effective for beginners. I can't wait to move up the ladder. Buy it,Try it, enjoy it!"
2,Less Cardio than the Get Ripped Advanced,"I bought this video in hopes of adding a new Tae Bo workout to relieve boredom. I found this workout to be less intense, less ""cardio"" than the Advanced Get Ripped workouts and it was just as long. I wish Billy would come out with a video that is 30 minutes or so and intense, but this isn't it. Look for my copy on Ebay."
4,Very good for beginners!,"First of all, everyone who rated this video with a low score is an experienced Tae Bo exerciser. I don't think this video is meant for those who are experienced or in excellent shape. However, if you are a novice looking for a good way to start a Tae Bo program (or any exercise program for that matter), this is a solid video that will definitely give you a workout. I just started using it, and I'm going to continue until I can work my way through more intense Tae Bo workouts. This is a good choice for a beginner!"
2,Not for me...,"I didn't really like this DVD. I'm new to the Tae Bo series, and I decided to give it a try after hearing so many positive things about it. I felt like Billy Blanks moved very quickly through the moves without really explaining what we were supposed to be doing, leaving me feeling frustrated rather than focused. Perhaps this is because I am a beginner, I don't know. I wouldn't recommend this to a novice exerciser, that's for sure."
5,Great to change up your routine,"I agree with others that this DVD doesn't give the intense cardio workout that it proclaims to give, but it is a great mix-up to my exercise routine. I recently pulled it out of my DVD storage to change up my cardio routine. I consider myself to be at an intermediate level but believe me I felt this workout the first few times I did it. It has been at least 3 years since I've done this workout. I've been doing it once every couple of days for about 2 weeks now and it's getting to be a little dull and I now need something more intense but it's definitely a great workout to do sparingly."
2,Too slow for me,"I was introduced to Tae Bo workout at a Club Med resort. I love it and the pace was exciting and the workout was great, I came home and still want to continue this exercise and went & bought the DVD, boy was I disappointed. It lacks the speed or the Cardio that I was looking for, maybe for a beginner it is o.k. not an intermediate."
2,TaeDon't,"I bought this DVD looking forward to yet another great Billy Banks workout. This did not happen. I didn't even break a sweat. I would recommend this DVD for people who are either not familar with TaeBo or, who want to learn about TaeBo. Stick with the Get Ripped Series, much more effective workout."
3,Great workout for a beginner,"This workout is great for a beginner. It really gets the heart pumping and you can adjust your moves to whatever speed your abilities are at right now, either faster or slower than what they are doing. I like that he does a set slow so you can get it and then at cardio pace.My only complaint on this workout is regarding the background people. You have one older one who has giant nipples that high beam you the whole workout and on the other side this crazy pumped up blonde that the camera keeps zooming in on her sweaty camel toe. It is seriously gross. Everyone else in the background is dressed appropriately. I took off a star each for those. Having fit people is motivational, I understand that, but nipples and sweaty camel toes are not motivational to me, just distracting."
3,It's a let down!,"After hearing so much about Tae-Bo, I had high expectations for this DVD. Perhaps because of the build-up, I am very disappointed. I normally run or cycle 3-4 times a week and am probably at an intermediate level of fitness. I picked this DVD up for those days when I can't make it outside or to the gym. The workout fails to provide the challenging cardio I wanted. You can make it more high intensity by jogging in place, adding your own jumps, and repeating his sequences; however, it's not really worth the time or money."
2,What they don't tell you on the cover,"I'm a Christian, but I'm not used to my workout instructors yelling to Jesus for strength and thanking him for the workout. I'm not really into Bible Beater media so I wasn't thrilled with that. Also, you HAVE to have resistance bands to make this worthwhile, which they don't tell you ahead of time."
1,Horrible,I would not order again from this seller. I purchased the item on the 9th of Sept and received it on the 10th of Oct. There was no communication from the seller at all.
3,"Tae Bo ""cardio""","Tae bo is always a good workout but this particular one has virtually no jumping or bouncing. I was a bit disappointed because when I see ""cardio"" I think ""jumping"" but if you need a workout that's low impact it would probably be great. You can definitely still get your heart rate up if you work at it. There are lots of squat-y type moves and knee lifts and kicks (and punching, of course). I found most of the moves to be doable; I could easily follow the first time around, with only a handful of them really challenging. I've done lots of kick box type aerobics, so if you've never done any kickboxing at all this would probably be challenging at first and take you a few times to catch on. Billy Blanks is terrible at cueing but since this is a home-workout I don't suppose that's critical. Also, I'm not sure if the close-ups of the chicks with super-bumpy sweaty washboard abs are suppose to motivate us or what, but I'm a mother of three and I just found it depressing!"
3,"Similar to Taebo ""Live"" Basic","I found that a lot of the moves were identical to the Taebo""Live"" Basic. I actually get more of a sweat with the ""Live"" video; maybe because I think it's a little faster than the Cardio. There were a few new moves that were challenging, which I haven't mastered yet, but all in all I prefer the Basic over this one."
5,A Very Good Workout,"I read some of the reviews before I bought this DVD and decided to try it for myself. I'd love to see the member who wrote the workout was equivalent to walking in place. I'm in the military, a certified personal trainer, and I know I'm in good shape. This workout made me sweat and kept my attention throughout the entire session. There were some parts of the workout that were identical to other Tae-Bo videos, but the new combinations impressed me to."
2,Warm-Up or Physical Rehabilitation Taebo?,"I agree with many other reviewers that this is a very slow form of Taebo. Calling it Cardio Taebo is very misleading, I think. The music is still bad (like original videos) and the movements are so slow. It is so boring, I have never been able to get through the DVD & after 2 times, I figure I should just donate it to the library. I bought this DVD because I wanted some variety from the other Taebo videos that I've used (and really enjoyed). If you like Taebo, don't get this, you'll be very disappointed. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the DVD."
5,Billy Blanks took instructor lessons for this...,"For all you instructors, or people who like a GOOD!!! instructor, Billy Blanks has done it!! This is a WONDERFUL workout that concentrates on good form. The music, who's listening, he actually is COUNTING!! in this workout.He still doesn't do all the workout, but the fact that he works on form, slows down so you can move correctly and not get hurt is worth it's weight in dvd's. This is one that I will do repeatedly.His other videos are good for a workout, but it's better to know the correct way to do the moves before trying to do the older workouts. This one, you can walk in cold and still get a good workout without pain."
3,Not Bad but Lacks Energy,"It's a pretty good video by Billy Blanks, but nothing really new. I've done quite a few workouts from the Tae Bo franchise and this one is somewhat on par with most of them. It doesn't have the energy and enthusiasm of some of his previous videos however. For a great workout, I'd recommend The Billy Blanks' Ultimate Tae Bo Workout video. If you want a good forty minute workout at a great price, I'd recommend this video. If you want a more upbeat Billy Blanks, you might want to try one of his earlier videos."
3,Just Ok but kinda slow,This is ok for beginners as an intro to Taebo but not recommended for those looking for amped up work out coz it's kinda slow-paced
5,Jussi's 1955 concert a must for fans and opera lovers,"This much-anticipated release of the 1955 Carnegie Hall concert, which includes nine additional selections that were not on the original LP, is a collector's item, not only for Bjorling's many fans but for those who appreciate the art of singing at its highest possible level. If nothing else, get it for ""Jeanie with the light brown hair,"" ""Ideale,"" and, my favorite, ""Il mio tesoro,"" that showcase Bjorling's brilliant mastery of technique and subtlety of vocal nuance in every register. Although much better than the LP release (which was in dubious sound, to say the least), this version has minor sonic problems that detract at times from the crystalline, silvery tones of one of the century's greatest tenors. The overall result is gratitude: both to Bjorling's incomparable art and to the folks at RCA who put together this historic CD that, as the Amazon reviewer stated, is a ""must."" You will find yourself listening to it over and over."
3,Jussi Bjorling Rediscovered-Amazon,Quality is spotty. Obviously some recordings made from others quite old. Sound is poor.Of course voice quality and performance is very superior. It sad that technical problems so reduce the pleasure that is available.
3,sound quality,"Jussi Bjorling Rediscovered: this CD was not given the sound engineering consideration the performer deserves. Bjorling has always been my favorite tenor from the very first time I heard and saw him in Manon Lescaut in 1959. However, with all due respect to the technicians who worked to produce this CD the sound is no where near as good as it ought to be. The CD does not meet up to the sound quality of the many other CD's I have of Jussi Bjorling. Sorry about that!!"
2,Repetitive (repetitive) and simplistic at times,"With a better editor, this book could have been about 300 pages instead of 900+. I found that the author repeats information over and over. There was a lot of Microsoft marketing-speak--does any of this really need to make it into a book? We also get gems of wisdom like ""The speed at which a computer can process data depends on the speed of its microprocessor"" (p115).Apart from these criticisms, the book is a reasonably good resource. A definite step above Microsoft's opaque documentation. But it could be so much better."
3,ISA SERVER 2000,Fair Book at time usedSome Useful in ClassroomNeeds updating even before ISA updatesWould not re-purchase
5,the best you can find even you are a newbie to ISA,"Hi to all,This book is really very cool and includes everything you want to know about ISA Server.It doesn't matter if you are new to ISA only knowlegde of TCP/IP , networking ..etc is enough to understand the content of the book.Don't miss it."
1,Westar EM8704 engine mount,"Installed the Westar EM8704 on my 1999 Nissan Altima. I was very disappointed in this part. Vibration was so bad that a 10 minute car ride had me feeling like I had just gotten off of an amusement park ride. Dizzy and disoriented.I ended up buying the OEM part from the dealer, and wow what a difference. It is like night and day. I'm usually one that tries to skimp where I can (which is why I bought this part in the first place), but the higher price for the part from the dealer was well worth it. With the engine mount from the dealer, I enjoy driving my car again. Given the hassle that comes with installing this part, I wish I would have bought the OE part in the first place. I would definitely NOT recommend the Westar engine mount."
5,THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!!,"I think Michael Jordan's autobiography, For the Love of the Game is the best book ever written. I would recommend this book to everybody. It is very interesting, and the pictures are great, also you get to know everything about the career of Michael Jordan from the man himself, it's great. Once again, read this book or you'll regret it."
5,For the Love of the Game,This book tells about Micjaels jordans life all the way from his college life in north Carolina to the nab playing on the Bulls. He led them to 6 nab championships. Then he went on to win the gold in the summer olympics. He is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Jordan is Jordan!,"The book let me know that Michael Jordan is the best player that he can't be replaced by anyone, Jordan is Jordan!"
4,It was different than I had expected,"I expected Michael Jordan to write about his career, but he ended up writing about how he felt with every event in his career. It mentioned things that I would never expect."
5,Michael Jordan is the Best!,"I love Michael Jordan,and his book has truly tuched my life,he is the greatest basketball player of all times,and he can not be replaced. The NBA will never be the same without Jordan,the NBA has lost one of the most valuble players in NBA history and he will never be forgoton or unheared of.Such a great loss,for the NBA and his fans.I love you Mike."
5,"Awesome, Captivating, Enchanting",Those who love Michael Jordan will love this book. It is certainly a good memorabilia to keep on the greatest player the sport of Basketball has ever known. Awesome photography and candid thoughts. A must buy and a must read for not only Jordan fans but also others.
4,Best layout and design I have ever seen - average content,"This book is just a beauty! The texts are combined with photos and great graphics that it is pure joy to go through Michael Jordan's story. But is it worth reading? Yes! There are some nice stories about Michaels father and the (mis-)management of the Chicago Bulls. But they never go deep, everyting seems to be treated superficially. However, I still recommend this book as it is a great souvenir on MJ, one of the best Basketball players on planet earth."
2,Autobiography??,"I was disappointed at this book. It's not really a true autobiography of Michael Jordan, but just a bunch of photos and statistics of his career, and just some random thoughts. The photos are nice, but there was a lot lacking. It reminds me so much of ""Rare Air"", Jordan's first ""autobiography"". And plus, it's too expensive. I wouldn't recommend buying it, just check it out from the library or browse it at the bookstore."
5,"Absolutely, positively outstanding!","As you read the narrative that is imaginatively layed out with different type and size mixed in with graphics and photos you can almost hear Michael Jordan speaking. They are his words and reveal some things about his life that I've never read before...and I've read everything written about him. As you can see I am a big fan and miss him so much on the basketball court. This book is just one of the many reasons that I along with millions of other people am a big fan of his. The book is as brilliant and polished as he is and also has the same good taste he has. Another great thing about ""For the Love of the Game"" is it will appeal to almost anyone of any age You can skim thru and look at the photos or read the stats or read every word. Whichever way you choose you will enjoy this book."
4,dated but good basic info,alot of the info in the book is now dated but is good for the beginners or as reference for experienced fishermen.
5,Handy Gadget,"I had used a PDA several years ago, but had all kinds of software conflicts. This Palm is great and I am still discovering what all it can do in addition to contacts and calendars. I did have to buy third party software to handle multiple contact lists. The end result was worth every penny that the Palm cost and the extra software. I carry it whenever I go out.Next time though I may look for one with a real keyboard, but not combined with a cell phone."
3,Your above-average fantasy novel,"This is not a novel to be taken extremely seriously; I found it to be an entertaining read, albeit slightly shallow. The characters, for the most part, are standard, but solidly drawn, and the plot is well constructed, (even if it does borrow heavily from other fantasy novels - but don't they all?) Ms. Resnick certainly has a talent for fast paced and gripping narrative, however some of the passages in this book are quite tedious and long-winded, and she seems to falter in the historical department somewhat. It's still good enough to make me want to read the sequel, though."
2,Can't say I'll read it again...,"First the good news: Ms. Resnick has built her world in wealth of detail and depth. It's the sort of place you feel could really exist somewhere on the map of today's world. The bad news... the book often reads like a newspaper clipping. Page after page of how the rebellion is going. In spite of several of the other reviews, I did not find the characters particularly well drawn. I always felt some distance from them, and was never able to sympathize with them. I fact, I was often hard-pressed to determine if some of the characters were supposed to be heroes or villians. This may be real life, but when I pick up a novel, I'd like my heroes to be someone I can admire, someone I'd like to get to know and be friends with. I would have been much happier to see more immediacy in the writing, more sense of actually being there and experiencing the action and the feelings of the characters and less offputting narrative."
3,"Okay, but way too long","It isn't that I mind big books--in fact, I usually read them in a few hours. I don't like big books that drag, though.So far, everybody has lost someone important. Anybody who loves anyone seems to be doomed. Betrayals are everywhere, and that's something I find profoundly disturbing.The book did end on a note of hope, and I want to know what happens next. I just don't know if I want it enough to slog through (at least) two more volumes."
3,Mediocre Fantasy,"The only things this book has going for it are the storyline and world-building, which a previous reviewer noted. The story is decent, but I think the book suffers from too many viewpoints. Add to that the author's annoying habit of not actually narrating the battles. But the story is somewhat interesting and not totally predictable.What this book doesn't have is characters. Every single one is one-dimensional. Tansen is the only character approaching being interesting, perhaps the book should have been told in his viewpoint. Having interesting, believable characters is very important for me in a fantasy book, and this one falls flat. Laura should give Robin Hobb / etc a call.All that said, considering how AWFUL some fantasy is, this deserves 3 stars merely because I finished it."
1,Can you say BORING?,This book had not nearly enough drama or excitment in it to keep me interested. I found the charactors to be shallow and poorly constucted. Resnick's attempt to make you like the charactors failed miserably. Altogether a boring and unenjoyable book.
5,Wonerful and Functional,"I purchased the white version of this tea kettel at my local target store to replace my 10 year old worn out tea kettel. I was very pleasantly suprised at it's ease of use, sleek design, and functionality. The water heats up quickly and the whistle is loud enough to be heard over the din of our 4 children, but not unpleasant on the ears if I am in the kitchen with it. The handle stays cool, the lid is snug fitting, the pop up spout is genius, and it is perfectly balanced, and it is an allover great product. I highly recomend it!!"
2,It Melts!,"This may work fine on a small-burner or electric stove, but on my Viking range, unless one's careful to place the kettle off-center on the burner, or to use very low heat, the spout heats up and the black plastic melts to the red metal. This kettle is particularly bad for large-burners because the base is so small. Definitely not recommend! I no longer have the box or I'd send it back. As it is, $40 wasted."
2,Spout melted,"Update: I contacted Oxo and they offered to replace, refund, or repair the tea kettle one time, but told me I had been using it wrong to use it on high heat. Apparently the tea kettle is designed to be used only on medium heat. A tea kettle? On medium heat? So, basically, if you have hours in which to boil water, buy this. I will give Oxo credit for great customer service. But I bought an electric tea kettle to replace this. It heats water SO FAST and no melting!The plastic around the spout on mine melted. I was using it on my power burner, but that's sort of the point since this is a tea kettle and you want the water to boil quickly. Now because the plastic is deformed the spout will not close. This is otherwise a very innovative design but who was the idiot who thought to use plastic instead of metal in that location?"
2,sad color,I bought a bright red tea kettle and after 1 use it has changed to a much darker color. Maybe I got a lemon? Would not recommend for someone who wants a red tea kettle.
3,Turned off by the religious element....,"Even though I'm Catholic, I was a little put off by the religious element of this DVD as I didn't really expect Billy Blanks to get into the whole ""tap into Jesus"" thing. This was also one of the few DVDs where for the most part he has an even count for each side that you're working on.Personally, I guess this DVD just isn't for me, however, the actual workout was good and done at a good pace. I have played it quite a few times, I just mute the sound and play other music in the background.All a matter of personal preference I suppose."
2,Nothing like Get Ripped Basic or Advanced,I really enjoyed his last set of DVDs. They had a combination of cardio and strength workouts. These are much slower and only about 25 minutes plus 10 minute warmup and 10 minute cool down.He also preaches too much about the lord in the DVD.I will most likely continue to use the TaeBo II: Get Ripped series .. especially the advanced for a great workout.
5,I can do all things...,"Billy Blanks does an excellent job bringing together faith and exercise. When you start to feel the burn and you want to give up Billy keeps reminding you that Jesus helps through everything and that includes exercise. The DVD is up lifting and makes you want to do the video. Working out no longer becomes a task and a burden, it becomes fun and uplifting."
5,Wonderful product and loud,I have this in a hyundai elentra GT hatchback and love it. Custom box with 1 huge port in middle and a very large box. Have jbl 2000 watt amp pushing it and they pound. Would recommend purchasing these for sure or the T2 version which i am getting next.
1,dissatified,The black cartridges worked fine for a couple of times then gave up. I will probably not orded refills again. It's too much trouble to send them back. I have not tried the color one yet.
1,Black ink cartridge done after a few jobs,So I've had these cartridges for about 6 months. The color one I rarely use and seems like it's still good. I think I've printed about 80 pages from the black cartridge before it started to give out and at about 100 it's totally done. Cheap junk. Never again.
2,What they don't tell you,"I bought this DVD set thinking it was a great price for 4 DVDs. However, what they don't tell you is that most of the exercises are only effective if you buy their specific equipment: the ""Sculpting Stick"" and the ""Fanny Lifter."" The ""Sculpting Stick"" was nothing more than an 8 pound bar and included 3 VHS's that contained the same exercises that I already had with the DVD set. The ""Fanny Lifter"" was the same story: it was packaged with more unwanted VHSs. The ""Fanny Lifter"" is nothing that spectacular. It consists of a 6 and an 8 inch step. If you want to know what you are getting, go with another exercise tape that TELLS you what equipment you need to have before using it. For example, the Denise Austin series not only tells you what you need (which is often optional), but doesn't force you to buy a specific set of equipment."
5,The Firm Analysis!,Iam a woman 56 years old!! And I have to say the FIRM ROCKS!! I received my tapes very quickly!! startingworking out about 5-6 days a week...has done some amazing things for my figure!! THANK YOU FIRM!!
3,Good to workout to but weight increase is so necessary,I started this set of dvd like 3 months agao and already i need heavier weights. it's good for beginners but more advanced people will need more motivation. The dvd i don't like too much is the maximum cardio burn. I get sweaty but i just don't like the movements at all. I do it b/c it's part of my roation. The Complete is funa and so is The Total Sculpt. The ab portions could be better.
5,The Firm is IT!!!!!!!,"I've been working out with the Firm for more than a year but recently purchased these DVD's and I don't regret it one little bit. I can tell you that these really work your thighs and abs, I'm already seeing amazing results and loving it. I never go by what the reviews say because I know the Firm is all I need and I do highly recommend these if you like to sweat it out!!!"
2,The Firm 4-pack Body Sculpting System,"I do not recommend this product. I watched and tried all of the workouts and I am very disappointed. First of all, you need to have The Firm Fanny Lifter and the sculpting bar for all workouts on these DVD. Second, these workouts have poor transitions. Third, the trainers are not motivational. Save your money. Don't buy this product."
1,Want to buy my copies?,"I love to exercise - classes, tae-bo routines, Kathy Smith, Denise Austin, hey - I even used to work out with the Richard Simmons 'Sweatin' to the Oldies' tapes, but I could not bare to suffer through The Firm routines more than once. I found The Firm to be boring, odd, and a bit cult-like. There really isn't a problem with any of the moves... I just honestly didn't like one bit of it. As an overall aerobic and weight lifting enthusiest, I caution anyone to preview The Firm workouts prior to purchasing."
4,Great tapes,"I found this set to be challenging but doable. I use a regular step and a step stool instead of the fanny lifter, and I use a chair and hand weights to replace the sculpting stick. You have to increase the weights pretty quickly, but that's a good sign of progress. I like all the tapes, and think there is a nice variety without sacrificing quality."
1,crap,"This controller is crap. Broke very soon after purchasing. If you want to buy a cheap controller with a small playable lifespan, this controller is for you."
1,Horrid,"Bought two of these, and they continue to stick on their main control sticks. Any game is ruined because of this. They will stick up/down/left/right/diagonal. You can get them unstuck, but this is ridiculous to have to do EVERYTIME you play a game in the middle of the game. I highly advise that you DO NOT BUY this product at all. It's cheap knock off material, the plastic is cheap, and the control stick quality is even cheaper. Would have never bought these if I knew how they were."
2,thumb stick broke almost instantly,"The controller seems just like any other game cube controller, however within a few minutes of using it the left joystick broke. It sticks, and I think the spring broke.Not worth the cheaper price. Go for a legitimate controller."
4,Game controller review,It can be hard to find game cube items anymore! I simply looked online at amazon.com and wow! there it is! The controller we needed for my sons gamecube!We recieved our product quickly and works perfectly.
3,Needs to be tweaked,"I have purchased 3 of these controllers in the past. I will agree with the other reviews of this product that they tend to work poorly. I have found that if you are interested in saving money by buying these lesser quality controllers, they can still be a good buy, as long as you have some patience. On all of the controllers of this brand name I have bought, I needed to take them apart and tweak them a little to get them working, and after I did they worked fine. Conclusion, if you want a solid quality controller, DO NOT BUY. But if you don't mind taking it apart and messing with it to get it to work, it is worth getting these cheap ones."
2,Kind of flimsy,Pros: very cheapCons: very short cordJoystick wore out after a few weeks of heavy useI'd recommend paying the extra few bucks for a name-brand controller that will last longer
4,GameBox Controllr,"Works well with Game Cube, i only niticed a slight difference in driving cars on the game, of course its new and not worn like the old paddles.I give it a thumbs up...."
1,Trash from China,These are knock off controllers. Don't be fooled by the font and similar packaging.
1,BROKEN IN A WEEK!,"Bought two of these controllers. The analog stick broke on both of them in a week's time. Worth the $0.01, but not the shipping costs. Terrible."
3,Meh....,"These are not official Gamecube controllers like they appear in the picture. They are also not black - they're the purplish blue of the original Gamecube. They work, but they are the little bit off that can mess you up sometimes. Only good since they were 5 bucks."
2,AX-GC controller,This controller wasn't even the authentic product. I didn't realize it until later when it broke after less than 5 days. The analog stick didn't work anymore and is was useless.
1,Unsatisfied,"I ordered eight Nintendo Gamecube (AX-GC Controller-Black (SIM), controllers, put four into use about two weeks ago, and already three of them are starting to malfunction. The buttons are sticking or are not responding when depressed by the user. If I were electronically talented, I might be able to build one good controller from the eight I received. The only reason I gave this product one star was because I couldn't submit this review without a rating."
4,"Good quality, GREAT price!","I got these controllers amazingly cheap, so I expected to get what I paid for (not much). But they actually work as well as the more expensive controller I have. The cap for the C-stick came off once, and I had to snap it back on. Also I do have to restart the controller from time to time, I don't think any more often than the other controllers though. So far I haven't had any serious troubles, but we'll see how they fair over time :)"
5,My best Christmas CD,"We all have been inundated with Christmas music since we were little. That contributes to making it difficult to find an enjoyable Christmas CD. It has to sound enough like ""Christmas"" to feel right. At the same time, it is hard to enjoy songs we have heard too often performed in the usual ways. Maybe that is the main reason I adore this CD. It is ""Christmas"" and it is ""fresh.""Yet what I think mainly makes me love this CD is the attitude of the singers. You can listen to choirs performing Christmas music for days without hearing a group that sounds so incredibly delighted to celebrate the birth of the Christ child. I don't need to know French to appreciate the joy in their voices. This is the sweetest Christmas CD I've ever heard, and I can't wait each year for Thanksgiving to come so I can begin to play it again."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this CD based on the reviews of others who have it. Perhaps my hopes were a little high after reading the rave reviews this collection got, but I have to admit I am disappointed in it. It definitely has a Celtic flair, and some of the songs are good, but the French vocals are a definite distraction for me. I knew it would be in French before I purchased it, but I guess I didn't gauge how it would actually affect me. Perhaps it will grow on me ... if not, it will be one of the lesser-listened to CDs in my Christmas collection."
5,One of the best,"Quite simply put, this is one of the loveliest Christmas albums I've ever heard. This year, instead of listening to ""Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer"" for the 4 billionth time, why not get a little closer to the season with music of this uncommon beauty?"
3,"Coffee Table, please","Unfortunately, a coffee table book with nice photos of decaying homes and architecture in Havana/Habana but without any script. There are a few better kept homes shown but no explanation on why the differences or details of the tenants whose portraits demand some biographical notes. Definitely the book isn't worth what it is selling for now, although you could frame some of the large photos if you don't mind destroying a book.The art of decay can be beautiful but the pain and suffering of those living there is sad. I would suggest that the reader watch the movie, Buena Vista Social Club, on YouTube to get another view of the current status of Havana homes.I wish all the fans of rustica could see these photos, I'm sure they would then define two kinds of rustica, the wealthy/clean version and the poverty/dirt definition. The rustica that is currently in vogue in books on Tuscany or Provence seem almost mild tokens of the definition when compared to the images of homes in Havana."
3,"Overall good, but the casters are terrible","Nice-looking, fairly easy to assemble, and good quality -EXCEPT for the casters. The manufacturer really skimped on these. They are not solid, don't roll smoothly, and the caster on the long leg does not sit level, so it does not swivel as you move the table, so the only smooth motion possible is lateral (in the direction of the long leg). If you try to move the table in another direction, say pulling it toward or away from you as you sit at it, the caster on the long leg will not swivel to accommodate those movements so the table tips instead of rolling smoothly. I have to pick the table up slightly to pull it closer or push it away. I am going to try a better-quality caster from the hardware store (hopefully I can find one that is compatible). If the manufacturer had spent a bit more on decent casters, I would've given this product a much higher rating."
3,Marginal Performaer,"I have to say that I was excited about the purchase of this product. The product photos pciture a very well built and stylish piece of furniture. After assembling the product, I found the table to be somewhat wobbly. The casters allowed the table to roll freely on hard floors but I would not recommend this for use on any kind of carpet. The table top itself is reasonably resistant to damage but the legs scratch easily and are so high that they could not be positioned under any of the bads, couches or chairs in our house."
1,Tarod wimps out !!,"I thought these books were truly subversive initially .....plus you had the added bonus of one absolutely divine 6ft5"" black haired, green eyed chaos lord as the central character for a start .... an author clearly influenced by aesthetic gothic themes, yet cerebral intention simply gives way to fairy floss by the end ...... Tarod changing his mind in the space of a few minutes after endlessly wrestlng with his destined fate for so long , and what's with Cyllan coming back to life to sit beside her man! Give me a break!! A writer who admits to being influenced by the likes of fantasy-metal group Black Sabbath should not have done this , the ending robs the book of any true credibility ..... if it wasn't for Tarod would not have bothered !!!"
2,Undistinguished,"This book was kind of boring... It was an ok ending to the Master Trilogy, but I disliked the ending, where Tarod devoting himself to giving up the Chaos stone suddenly in 5 minutes reverses his decision. Also the fairy tale ending with Cyllan being resurrected... All in all a rather mediocre piece of work."
2,Beware of wrinkles!,"If this slipcover doesn't fit exactly (or a little snug) it will wrinkle like nothing I've ever seen. The slipcover fits my cushions a little big, but not anything too bad so there shouldn't this much of a problem with wrinkles. But there is. If you feel like ironing every day then go ahead and get it... but I regret my purchase."
1,Save Your Money and Don't Bother,"I downloaded this for my palm centro through handmark and it never worked. To beat it all neither handmark nor mobitv will help me or return my money (been waiting two months and counting) after calling and leaving several messages, emailing reps, and trying repeatedly to clear up this matter through the handmark website I am forced to give up and let the crooks keep my money. Lesson learned."
2,Better than original? @ell no!,"I cannot believe you people rating this album 5 stars and saying it's better than the original.... It's a good reggey but its references to Pink Floyd are a bit annoying.. I dunno.. The ""Orb"" remixes were for sure more annoying. This one is better but still don't do it for me. The only good remix/remake project I heard so far was Luther Wright & The Wrongs ""Rebuilding the Wall"". Pretty intellegent _remake_ not _remix_. This one - NO.To sum up. It's amuzing but pretty amateur attempt.."
5,Nice job!,"Seriously, I can actually listen to Pink Floyd (ala All Stars) now without falling to sleep or flipping through the cd case looking for something else. Serious props!"
4,Surprisingly good,"At first glance, you might dismiss this album as yet another bad remake of perfectly fine classic music in an unexpected style that manages to parody both the classic music and the new style (as in Hayseed Dixie). Dub Side of the Moon, however, was clearly made by individuals who love and respect both Dark Side of the Moon and roots reggae. They manage to do justice to both in this album.If you lived in a cave for the last 30 years and didn't know anything about Dark Side of the Moon, you would easily mistake this album for a landmark reggae effort. It's fine reggae and a fine version of Dark Side of the Moon. The only things keeping this album from 5 stars is that it wasn't an original work and some of the transitions between songs lack the fluidity of the original. All in all, a very worthwhile purchase."
5,Fantastic!,"Dub Side of the Moon is an extremely successful reggae interpretation of the original Pink Floyd masterpiece Dark Side of the Moon. It stands on its own as a great work, which is remarkable given the very difficult subject matter and mythical status of the original.What is so wonderful about Dub Side of the Moon is it is both very accessible and familiar while being something completely new and original. Kudos to the production/arrangement team for a remarkable job.Nothing was left out - listen with headphones and hear faint, almost subliminal speaking in all the right places. One can even sync it to The Wizard of Oz!! The attention to detail and obvious love of the original material really shows.I highly recommend this album."
3,"music good, vocals blah","The music is very good and is very similar to the original but there are a few parts where the ""rasta"" style vocals get out of control and straight up kill it. Still all and all not a bad album, if you have the original thought I would say to just listen to that and save your money."
4,Reinterpretation,"Easy Star All Stars album Dub Side of the Moon reinterprets Pink Floyd's album Dark Side of the Moon with an awesome rhythmic style and keen sense of creativity. I have to admit I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, so I was a little hesitant to listen to what I thought was a cover album. I have listened to the E.S.A.S.'s Dub Side a few times now and absolutely enjoy the way this band has remade/recreated the music in their own, unique style. The song Time has got to be hands down my favorite song on Dub Side. Anyway, if you are a fan of music in general you should check out this album. If you are a fan of Pink Floyd in particular, you must check out this album."
2,Not so good,"I did not like this as much as I thougth I would. It was okay. It startee out good but I was disappointed all in all. Being a big Pink Floyd fan, it did not do them justice. It is not meant to be in this venue I guess."
5,Great way to remember the past!,"Jus t how i sayed, it is a great way to remember the past in a very much positive rithym.!"
3,Like a big red London Bus,"It's impossible to review this without reference to the original. What does this version offer? Well, it's a well played and enjoyable album which offers some good interpretations of brilliant rock music. For sure it's reggae approach is suited to DSOM, but therein lies a problem - the tracks come at you like London buses. The first one is a bit of a novelty, but by the time the third or fourth one comes along you've got the picture and the 'sameness' starts to descend. Listened to in proximity to the original then I have to say that this album misses the edge of the original. 'Exhilirating'is how I would describe the original, this one - well it's fun, it lumbers along (sometimes at quite a pace) and it's a good ride at times.Having appeared to rain on the party, I would offer that it is a good album, and enjoyable too. 3*'s is a fair assessment in my view, and perhaps this will offer a bit of balance to the hyped reviews which dominate this release."
5,A beautiful reference book of actresses from classic film,"Gorgeous pictures, complete with tidbits of fact and interesting anecdotes. Good for reference if you want to learn more about actresses of the golden age."
4,A nice book but....,"I received this book as a gift and starting reading it right away. An interesting little book, but there should have been other actresses added and better editing done. For example on page 95 there is a photo of Susan Hayward and Richard Conte. The caption on the photo is 'I Want to Live! 1958) unfortunatly, Richard Conte was NOT in that film, the photo is actually from 'I'll Cry Tomorrow'. A mistake like this especially from the folks in connection with Turner Classic Movies is really an insult to movie buffs! This makes the rest of the book suspect. Shame on them! I seems that people have not found this review helpful... why, I have no idea?? If you like spending money on a book that has incorrect information than so be it. I would rather spend my hard earned money on something I can read with total satisfaction and not misprints."
2,A so-so book,The print was very small and hard to read and it didn't help that the print was light on the paper. You almost had to squint to read it and there was a lot of eyestrain. Not enough detail.
1,TEENY TINY PRINT,This book must have been written for an ant. The font is awful. The size is miniscule and the color is LIGHT gray to make it even MORE unreadable. Can't review the book because I couldn't read it even with glasses on. The publisher should take into account that probably mostly older people would be reading this book because it's about actresses from way back when. Would give it NO stars if I could.
2,Superficial self promoting,"The title of this book is misleading. It should be ""The 50 Most Unforgettable Actresses of the Studio Era whose films can be viewed on cable network TCM."" It is by no means a definitive list of 50, because it omits the great box office champions of other studios such as 20th Century Fox and Paramount. The most obvious example is Betty Grable, possibly the greatest box office champ of all.The essays are relatively short summarising the key points of interest of each of the actresses. As a superficial volume to which you may refer when viewing TCM or as a guide for a young person unfamiliar with the Golden Years, the book has merit. Buy it for what it is but don't believe the title!"
5,this is a great book!,This is a great book for anyone who is a fan of days or of Ali. This is also a good book for anyone that would like to act on a soap or in general. She gives a lot of information about her childhood about acting and the show. The start of the book was kind of slow I give it 4 stars but the rest of the book I give 5. I also liked her advice on health and fitness it was very simplistic stuff but it worked for her and if you watch the show and know about her she had a baby after writing this book not long ago and it appears like she's lost her baby weight so her plan obviously works and helps her to keep the weight off too. I agree with her that it's about health and a lifestlye not just a diet. She gives a lot of good advice and it's a very interesting read. I highly recommend it! I've just started reading burnt toast by teri hatcher.
4,All the Days of My Life (so far),The book was a very interesting insight into Alison Sweeney's life and how she is off camera. She sounds like a person I'd like to meet.
2,Not as advertised,This movie is not a documentary of different explorers as the title suggests. It's rather the personal reflections of James Cameron on how much effort it took him to make movies about the ocean. It has a very leisurely pace to it. Mr. Cameron talks about the various engineering difficulties he encountered while trying to make movies in the ocean. It's very non-technical.
3,Kind of misleading,"I thought this would be James Cameron's famous underwater documentary.it's not. It's some other guy who does an interview with Cameron and Buzz Aldrin. I found it enjoyable, but it's not really what I thought it would be. Also, the important parts such as the underwater portions look to be about dvd quality, not blu ray."
4,A Fun Insect Whodunit,"Before I read this book, I had heard of the great locust swarms of the 19th century, mostly from reading Laura Ingalls Wilder. I had not realized that swarms of the Rocky Mountain locust no longer flew and that the insect was now believed to be extinct. This book has great stories on the experiences of the victims of locust swarms. The second half takes up the question of why the locusts are gone. It's a good example of a scientist's life and how progress gets made in science. Much of the research was done by taking insect samples from melting glaciers. (If you're not convinced yet that global warming is changing the climate, this is a good book for you.) The pace of the book drags in spots, but overall it is a fascinating tale."
4,Why no maps?,"I actually really like the book and would normally be happy giving it 5 stars. But, I couldn't figure out why he didn't include any actual quantitative information. No maps. No tables. He mentions a couple of times how good the maps were in the original reports he uses as references, but he doesn't include any of them (except once as a small chapter opening illustration). Even just an inside cover map of the Permanent Zone and the range of the Locusts would have been a really nice addition.I still recommend the book very highly."
3,"Locust, Schmocust!","This book was interesting, but it kind of bogged down in the middle where the author goes on & on & on about the government's failure to help out the settlers who got clobbered by the locust's depradations and about who blamed who about the locust's appearance on the prairie. The parts about his search for the Rocky Mt. Locust were very interesting as well as the parts where he discussed the insect & its life-cycle. A good editor could have pared this book down by at least 50 pages and that would have been a good thing. I recommend that you read it, but be prepared to skim a bit when the going gets dull."
4,I know what happened to the locust,"History tells us what happened to the locust in 1877, but it is history that is denied by many because they do not believe the facts. Because of the destruction from the locust the summer before, the governor of Minnesota, Governor John S. Pillsbury, proclaimed April 26 as a day of fasting and prayer. The next morning the weather turned very warm and the locust appeared. Three days passed and the unseasonable heat caused a vast army of locust to hatch out. Then, on the fourth day the temperature plunged to freezing temperatures and the locust were killed before they could breed. God answered prayer and destroyed the locust. We can surely say God blessed America."
2,"Too Break Away, Doesnt Stay","It's pretty but the adjustment length (achieved by sliding it) does not stay put, and my cat somehow breaks it open. We find it laying around the house within the hour of putting it on."
2,Cute but not well made,I ordered 3 of these collars. I followed the instructions to open the collar (pulling it apart where the safety release is). One end of the collar broke away from the safety release rendering the collar useless. The other two were equally as hard to break away and the adjustable tabs are round pieces of metal with a piece of the collar tucked inside. A cat could get a claw caught in there when scratching its neck.
5,"Functional, cute & cheap","I have one cat that I could NOT keep in a collar. I bought several different types with buckles and clasps which would be off in under a day. Not this one! Either because it's so light and thin so he doesn't notice it, or because of the fastening system--this one has stayed on! It may be a bit unimpressive to look at, but its cord design fits cats' thin necks. I do recommend this collar as an excellent buy and innovative design. My only warning is to watch when you open the package! I had to buy this item twice, because the first time I opened the package with scissors and the collar itself was situated at the very tip of the package. Ooops!"
1,recommend against it,"I wasn't happy with this collar. First, I hadn't realized just how thin it would be -- I wanted small and lightweight but this is hardly wider than a rubber band. But more importantly, I think the way it adjusts for size is dangerous. When I put it on one of my cats, the extra length wouldn't tighten sufficiently so there was a gap, which she managed to get her lower jaw hooked into, so that the collar was stuck half around her neck and half in her mouth. I took it off and threw it away. Fortunately, since it's so inexpensive, I didn't throw away a lot of money. Also, the metal pieces where the size adjustments are made are not terribly smooth -- you might not want those rough bits of metal against your cat's neck."
3,john paul young,"JPY is not well known beyond their super mega hit ""Love is in the air"". If you want to have a glimpse of their music this compilation can help. It's entertaining but no other song can overcome their great success. This edition is not remastered. Its simply okayJPY no es muy conocido mas alla de su super mega hit ""love is in the air"". Si queres tener un pantallazo sobre su música este compllado puede ayudarte. Es entretenido pero ninguna otra canción puede superar su gran exito. A esta edición le faltaría alguna remasterización para poder beneficiar su audición. It's okay"
2,A Piece of JUNK!,"We bought this toy for my son today. I have to say that for the most part it is junk. The pieces do not stay together when you try to make the ""dragon"" and when they are attached to the action figure they fall off as well. I was hesitant about buying this toy since I know that is a common problem with Power Ranger ""Battlized"" figures that have all the small parts. Don't buy this toy and save your money...."
3,Not material to boost Lord Finesse's status,"I ordered this album expecting to hear some vintage DITC lyrics and rhymes bringing it back to the days of the second golden era, right? Wrong. Lord Finesse was never a great MC, he's dope on the boards though. I will never dispute that. This album high points come when the listener hears Big L voice once again on the tracks ""Yes You May"" and ""You Know What I'm About"". Only the latter four tracks of the album may you nod your head in agreement, as for everything else, you'll be shaking your head in dissapointment."
2,Disappointing and Overrated,"Barry had a good idea but the delivery is predictable, unsurprising, and not nearly as funny as I'd expected it would be based on the reviews -- the work of a young writer who isn't saying anything new. The dialogue, in particular, is atrocious -- just flat and boring -- and the characters are never developed sufficiently. If you want really smart, funny, fresh, outrageous, genuinely quirky social satire, turn instead to Thomas Pynchon, Dawn Powell, Nathanael West, John Barth, Kurt Vonnegut, even relative newcomer Jonathan Ames, or any number of other good satirists."
3,Not so good,"Generally speaking, I'm all about anti-corporative works, myself being fortunately able to escape the corporative world and make a decent living by my own.This book, which is not bad (it's simply highly forgettable), has one major flaw: it's not funny enough. It's advertised as funny, as some kind of Scott Adams, but it's not. It begins funny, then suddenly it's dark (which I can get), but it seems the writer lost the purpose of the book.Well, anyawy, I didn't feeel I lost precious moments of my life by reading it, so..."
2,The fun ended too early,"After Kostova's ""The Historian"" broke me, I tried to find the lightest, most pointless new fiction around and grabbed this after reading the NYT review. Needless to say I did not have high hopes, so I wasn't too disappointed.The book starts out funny and has some twists and hilarious characters, but halfway through, you find out the big secret. After that, there's really nothing left to tell. The result is a formulaic unfolding of events. At least it's short."
5,easy read,This would make a great tv show. What if you were in a gerbil in a cage and didn't know it?
3,Literary equivalent of a doughnut,"If you've worked in an office setting or read Dilbert or seen Office Space, Company will tell you absolutely nothing new about the world of work, but it's a (very) light, enjoyably flaky read that goes down easily and is soon forgotten. Read it at the gym like I did. And, no, I didn't notice any Australian colloqualisms in the text; ""sacked"" is used as a synonym for ""fired"" just as much in the US."
2,Review - Company,"I found the book amusing and freqeuently chuckled, but ending was a bit of a letdown. Still though, recommended it to several friends."
1,Compan - novel,"Boring. Written at about sixth grade reading level. Not well thought out, rambles. Did not hold my attention. Waste of money"
4,Story of my life!,"Having worked for a huge, Fortune 15 company for the past four years, I felt like the book was written about some of my experiences, yet I was laughing or completely jaw dropped for nearly the entire book. I read it completely on the bus for my commute, and got a few of my neighbors on the bus interested in the book just from my laughs.The only reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think the first surprise in the book (around page 100) was actually more exciting for me than the climax. The book ended exactly how it should have, and it was never clear in my mind until the very end what Jones (the main character) was going to do, but after the bombshell in the beginning of the book, nothing else would surprise me!"
3,Company is fun,Company is a quick bit of light fun.It certainly is not the brilliant anticorporate subversion the New York Times made it out to be. Just fun.
2,Like a 350 page Dilbert comic.,"Imagine a Dilbert comic. Pretty funny, hey. I'm a big fan of Dilbert, and I'd say that most people who are considering buying this book also are. Now imagine a Dilbert comic (or series of Dilbert comics) stretched out to 350 pages in length. That might sound like a good idea in theory, but in practice it doesn't really work. Yes, ""The Company"" does contain a lot of jokes and on their own each individual joke is funny (much like a single joke in a three panel Dilbert comic is funny). However, to me it felt like the author had just come up with a large number of individual jokes and strung them together to make a story. This might work in an anthology of comic strips, but in a novel, it results in poor character development. All of the characters seemed like cardboard cut-outs to me and by the end of the book I felt no emotional attachment to any of them. Overall I found this book to be very unsatisfying and have since sold my copy of it."
4,"Office Politics, Writ Large","Everyone who has worked in the environment of a large corporation is familiar with the constant niggling tensions, the non-stop jockeying for favor among the cubicle veal. As a former Hewlett-Packard worker Max Barry is well-versed on the concept.""Company"" takes the idea of office politics to the next level -- what if a corporation were NOTHING BUT office politics? What if the corporation's whole reason for being was to test out various theories of management -- what if THERE WERE, IN FACT, NO CUSTOMERS?Barry's three novels have all sailed similar waters, but they have gotten more realistic and more believable as he has matured as a writer. With ""Company"" he has written not only a fully developed novel, but a fully believable cast of characters and very realistic portrayal of life inside a shareholder-value boilerhouse.This story would make a very good summer movie, if the screenplay was adapted by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze."
4,Car Wash Surprise,"I have almost all Neuvo Flamenco artist and albums and am always looking for new ones. I happened upon this while sitting in the car wash! Why didn't it come up on my Amazon suggestions. The rythems are crisp, the guitars are well woven together and it was a real pleasure to listen to over and over - and I have a clean car now."
1,Two Plugs?,"Ok... my rating isn't fair because I love these headphones. I've ordered them after loosing them 3 times now. This is the 4th and I decided I wanted to get the integrated mic only to find it's for phones with a separate mic jack and not a all-in-one jack. This might have been my fault for not ordering the right one. But Amazon, you should have taken a pic of the two end jacks as well!"
2,I gave this away,"Not what I expected. I thought a square tree skirt would be different, it was. It has no ties in the back so it never stayed together. It was also the material of a throw blanket and it looked just like I cut up a blanket and put it around my tree. After a week of frustration I gave it away."
3,"""The Ads Kill It""","The stories are done well enough but the frequent, repetative commercials just kill the experience of the audio tapes. I turely resented having to sit through them and, as much as I love the Twilight Zione, I will not buy any more from this series beause of them."
4,La Numero UNO del POP latino femenina!,"Finally a great Yuri collection! Well, perhaps not great as in any greatest hits compilation would have it there are a bunch of songs missing. But it comes pretty damn close! This could've been a tight collection if only the record label didn't look past her Christian albums. Let's face it, Y tu como estas was a big hit for her and so why isn't it on the compilation?! Otherwise, this compilation gives you the chance to remember the reason why Yuri was huge back in the day. She might've ripped off Madonna at certain times but she still held her own many other times. Most female pop singers of this day aren't as good vocally speaking as Yuri is. Yuri is a classic and she deserves respect and love. VIVA YURI!"
4,Can whites play the tango?,"They can and there's Evan Lurie to prove it... with more than a little help from Alfredo Pedernera on bandoneon and Marc Ribot on guitar. John Lurie must have liked his brother's composions since he covered ""Deternmination"" on the Lounge Lizards cd ""No pain for cakes"". No irony here but a warm and masterful tribute to the old and mostly unknown masters of the tango."
2,I am Sharing book review,"I got this for my almost two year old after I was tired of hearing ""mine!"" She enjoys the book and now gets the idea of sharing but I am not totally thrilled with the book. The words in the book say that the older brother is sharing but the illustrations prove that he is not really sharing (sharing 1/8th of a blanket instead of 1/2, or giving the little sister broken crayons instead of half of his crayons.) Bottom line, cute but not the best book in terms of teaching your little one about sharing!"
1,Book in Bad Shape,"I cannot review the book content, because it was in poor shape and had to be returned. Mercer Mayer is always a hit, so I'm sure we'd have kept it, otherwise."
5,aboslutely wonderful,I didn't know this author but after reading this book I'm searching for her others.The story is about two babies switched at birth: the writing is great and I actually had to put the book down two or three times especially at the beginning because it was so emotionally intense. Anyone who has had a child in a hospital can relate to the characters' dilemma. I really recommend it
3,No headphone plug on 6620,FYI I do not have this product but I do have a 6620 and there is no place on the phone to use the earbuds. I think that Nokia changed the connector on the 6620 to what they call a pop-port which is a proprietary connector for multiple uses. 9.99 is a good deal for the case and charger but don't expect to use the earbuds.
3,Good thing it was free after rebate,"Accessory pack includes a plain car charger, a plain hands-free ear bud, and a snug fitting leather case. All-in-all pretty standard stuff, with the exception of the case. Although it appears to fit very well for an after-market case, it seems to fit ""TOO"" snugly. The phone, while in the case, emits a high-pitch sound from the speaker as you hold it to your ear, with the phone turned on but not connected. I suspect that one or more of the phone buttons are being pressed/squeezed, thus generating the sound. I'm trying to stretch the case out, by turning the phone off and placing it in the case at night. Hopefully, this will work, as the case looks good and will certainly provide protection for the phone."
5,Love this product!!,I can't believe I can no longer get this! It is the best on the market! Every other lipstick fades away - even those that promise 16 hour color. Max Factor actually delivers. I don't know what I will do when they are all gone!
5,wonderful,I have used Lipfinity since it came out and I still love it. It is the only lip stick I use.
5,one of their best albums,this album is one any ska fan should not be without.every track is good.some even brilliant.a good range of tempos and as usual from the busters.great lyrics and fantastic tunes.the vocals on tracks 4 6 8 9 and 15 are my favourite. I liked most songs the first time I heard them.one or two took a while to grow on me . not too long though.
3,Not so well written,"I am ""the millionaire next door"" working to formalize my understanding of investments and markets via a CFP certificate course prior to sitting for the exam. This text book does, as another reviewer stated, assume a working industry knowledge and to me smacks of something written by someone who has been in the academic world too long. In many, many cases a simpler explanation is possible. A user will find many places where text and charts, questions and charts just don't quite line up. Perhaps it is a case of lazy editing. In any case, while not impossible to use, with more care it could be more user friendly."
1,Unhappy at all,I even haven't receive this item yet. and the seller never reply me. I wish I could dispute this transaction!!!
3,4th edition,"This book is well organized, but you better have a solid calc and stats theory background. The newest edition has more chapters. Book is more wordy than concise."
4,"Good, easy. Very good, very easy. Maybe too easy.","The book is accepted as standard book in many finace courses all over the world, including the Wharton. Nonetheless, sometimes the book talks a lot but says little or says very simple things.Excellent for beginners, only good for somebody that has already read some finance book."
4,Great customer focus!,"When I received my book I also received a $5 bill and a note from the vendor saying that the shipping ended up being cheaper than expected so they gave the savings back to me. They could have easily kept the $5 as extra profit, but they didn't. I think that says a lot about their integrity and how they value customers. I really appreciated it."
3,Simple: Written for morons,"Although this book is championed by finance profs worldwide including mine -- Burton G. Malkiel -- the book is repetitive, verbose, and insulting to anyone of decent intellect."
2,Rip Off,"This was advertised as like new. However, it is the 6th edition, and the current edition is the 8th, so it is considerably outdated."
4,A Good Book that Got Me Through A Tough Class,"With this book, I was able to learn what the professor could not effectively teach. I had a professor who could bewilder Alan Greenspan, and nobody to study with. With this book and a curve, I received a nice grade. The text is comprehensive and easy enough to cram with for a few days. I kept it for a good reference source."
1,Very Disappointed with Purchase,I am very disappointed with this purchase. The strips would not stick securely to your nose and they did not remove any black heads. I have used Biore for a while and they always work. Do not waste your money. I would like to have my money returned.
3,Not as good as the first 2 sets,"I absolutely love watching Julia Child, was excited when the first 2 sets came out. I enjoyed both of those. My complaint with this one is that it is only 12 episodes, instead of 18 like the other sets. Disc 1 is a biography from the American Masters series instead of the French Chef show. If it had 18 episodes, I'd rate it higher."
3,Good adventure but not well written!,"Our book group read this book. Some of us enjoyed her story, others did not, but we all agreed that she was not a particularly skilled writer and that she appeared to think a lot of herself. To her credit, in the book she does say that she has never been praised for her social skills. None of us were interested in meeting or talking with her. We were not clear on why she was so hell bent on rowing across the Atlantic unless it was simply so she could brag about having done it."
3,too pale,"this is once again too pale, didnt look like that on the photo when i bought it, can and will pass it along to one of my grandchildren, so a good job i didnt pay much for this, otherewise i would have returned it"
1,They lost me as customer forever,"Barely any lipstick in there. Does not last like it used to. Total ripoff. Sad, I used to get this for over 7 years. NO more!! People, let me know if you found a formula that you like better."
5,Daniel O'Donnell & Friends,"Daniel only gets better & better with each album, and this one is no exception. This album will warm the hearts of anyone, his sincerity and warmth of presentation is delightful and Mary Duff simply adds a sparkle with solos & duets that makes you wanting their next album ASAP. His songs focus on pure, clean subjects, no smutty nor questionable morality in his songs....oldie remakes, ballads, beautiful self-written new songs suitable for *any* age group make Daniel my personal favorite music artist without question. Listening to him is simply the very best emotional tuneup you could ask for!"
4,better then the best,daniel has taken my friends over like a storm'especially the wives ----keep on singing
4,Sousa Forever!,"I've always loved John Phillip Sousa without really knowing why other than remembering playing his marches in band and tearing up every time I hear The Stars and Stripes Forever. In John Phillip Sousa, America Phenomenon, Paul Bierley shows that Sousa was a true American hero-- a musical genius who was also a caring boss and an inspiration to the musicians he led for decades. While at times the book seems somewhat detached from its subject and a little too dry and scholarly, there are enough anecdotes to give a good picture of the man known as the March King. Bierley also gives a good picture of what the musical scene was like at the turn of the century during the transition years at the start of the radio and audio recording era.How nice to read a biography of a man who was close to his family, treated his employees in an honorable manner and who held himself to the same strict standards he did others. If you want to read about a true American hero, this would be a good book to read."
3,Like eating crab,"There seems to be little in the way of information on this amazing composer. The author, an engineer, writes like one: dry, factual, and with lots of padding -- a trait that the March King himself abhorred. However, as with trying to get the sweet meat out of Dungeness crab, there are some tidbits worth fighting for. On the back, I may have found a reference to what I was really seeking: the stories behind Sousa's music. I guess the best I can say is that, despite pedantic and fussy details, I was able to cull the appreciation of a true musical genius and American. I'll keep looking for a book I can enjoy -- perhaps Sousa's own autobiography, if I can find it."
5,Incredible -- What a Punch!,"The 4 parts of this story are like 4 bullets hitting you in each corner, but something about them makes for a 5th bullet that gets you in the middle. How does it work? Friends I've turned on to it can't say, but they agree it is psycologically perfect in terms of doing it to you! If you love Horror/Weird, see how this one does it subtley in ""subtext"" as well as overtly. Why didn't it win some kind of prize? Maybe there's a bias against such truly dark writing -- but not here! I looked for other works by this author and found only a prescient and out of print ECOLOGICAL CIIZEN (non-fiction) but nothing since M.Gothic. One can see why! It's all in this one strange novel."
5,The fado diva would be proud,"Amália Rodrigues, portuguese fado diva, left these 14 songs and gave them to her longtime guitar player Jorge Fernando. Instead of doing another typical fado cd, he invited 14 different bands and artists to put their souls in each song.The result is magnificent. Fado is salsa, gipcy, new age, pop and etc under those names.You have to buy this.Its rare and original."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the other reviews, I was really looking forward to this collection. I am very disappointed. The sound quality is terrible. These are very old recordings and have not been treated well. Even with the restoration mastery of JSP, at least 50% of the tracks on this collection are painful to listen to."
5,Wonderful Movie!,I remember watching this movie as a little girl and I love Sally Field. This movie always touches my heart and makes me cry.
2,Disappointed in the quality and strength,"I had seen several of these trailers with a red frame and thought that is what I was purchasing.Turns out this is an imported copy of an american made product, but they sure didn't copy it very well.The metal began rusting within a short time and the hinge pin for the bed wore through very quickly after a few uses.I do not recommend and this is the last time I order anything from Northern Tool."
3,New Look,Classical culture that has been lightened up and watered down a bit to appeal more to the MTV crowd. Since I like my higher culture undiluted I would probably give it a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10.
1,Poor Seller,"Bought from MovieMars. It won't load to DVD player and when loaded to my pc and it said ""No disc"" I contacted the seller ""MovieMars"", got no answer at all.New Year's Concert 2012 (DVD)"
3,Fiction not fact,"I was mislead by the synopsis which implied that this was an academic study of the Lilith myth. It is first and foremost, fictional and artistic interpretations of Lilith. This book is for anyone interested in the retellings of this myth, but it is not for those interested in the academic approach to Lilith, although one may pick up a few interesting bits of informatio along the way."
4,Gifted this book to a 12 year old,"I bought the book as a gift for a child who is very much interested in anything having to do with weapons from WWII. The pictures looked like they were taken in Virginia; they certainly didn't seem very ""German."" However, they were well done and showed much detail in the weaponry."
3,"nice photos, interesting articles","The photography is excellent, clear concise pictures of real weapons with the added bonus of a little historical background of guns and the units that used them. Nice info on operation and dissassembly. There is very little detail on the accessories and attachments. The tripod for the MG34/MG42 is a fantastic piece of machinery in its own right but very little is said of such things. I suppose that since the book is written about the guns ( and quite nicely I might add) I should be happy. I was hoping to find something covering a little more ground on the accessories though. Over all...Good addition to the library for anyone interested in wwII German weaponry."
1,too hard,"I ordered this because it ""looked"" exactly like one I've used for years and loved but was worn out--So much for appearances. This one was hard and uncomfortable."
1,like a brick,"I purchased this pillow thinking it would be good for my back, having used this type in the past. forget it. This thing is like a brick!!! No give at all. It might be good for a horse with a 100 pound head but not a normal human being."
1,I really don't know who those 3 guys that review this product but .....,"Save your money! I've own it so far for about 3 weeks and even though it does help your neck .... some what ..... there are some days where my neck feels real sore and other times it just feels decent. The form wears off in a couple of days, I'll have to flip the pillow around where the fresh foam is and then I'll have to flip the damn thing again where the foam is already about to wear off again within a day or two. It isn't worth it, thing is a cheap piece of crap. I recommend you spend more money and avoid wasting 20 dollars on this. I don't know about these 3 clowns but listen to me and go spend 40 dollars or more for a better product. I might have to throw this pillow out by the end of this month leaving me to go SPEND more money on something else. Real disappointed."
2,"Too hard, too high","I should have listened to other reviewers. This pillow has no give at all. So when it says it's four inches high, that's where your head will be. It is what it says it is, but I don't see how this is good for people with neck problems. I bought it hoping to replace a very similar pillow I bought years ago at a medical store. My old one--also eggcrate foam--is the same height but soft enough that your spine/neck stays straight when laying down.This pillow is unusable for me."
2,Too Hard,"I should have known better than to order a pillow off the internet where I couldn't physically check its softness. This pillow is way too thick and too hard. I woke up with a sore neck. My husband, who always steals my pillow, won't even touch it. It has gone to goodwill and I replaced it with a cheaper and more comfortable pillow from my local discount store."
1,So hard it made my ears hurt,"I bought this because it looked like a pillow I had 10-12 years ago that was the perfect combination of neck support and comfort until the foam disintegrated after 4 years. But by the end of the night both of my ears were sore because the foam was so hard. Either the triangle cores are too firm or the top foam isn't dense enough to provide sufficient cushioning for my ears. I'm thinking of cutting the layer off the bottom and putting it on the top to see if that will work. I'm sure the availability of foam products has changed over the years, but manufacturers should really try their own products before they put them on the market. If half the people who try a pillow say it's too hard, then why don't they make a more comfortable model?"
1,DISAPPOINTED & DISGUSTED!!!,"This album / CD is a RIPOFF!!! These are not the originalversions of the songs but re-recordings done many decades later.I was unaware of this when I ordered this CD and I am quiteupset about it. I feel that the web site's failure to advisethat that these are not the original versions constituteseither negligence or deception. The very use of the word""Anthology"" in this case is deceptive, though it comes fromthe CD producers, not from the web site, of course.I STRONGLY recommend that people looking for the real thingstay away from this CD."
3,"Not the real deal, but...","This is a Clovers group led by original member Harold Lucas, the remnants of which are still touring. Even though they're not the original group, they are considered the legitimate ""Clovers"". Most of this stuff was recorded in the late 1980's by a group consisting of Lucas, Johnny Mason, John Bowie, and Steve Charles. If you're new to the Clovers, skip this one and get one of the collections of the Atlantic material."
5,The Bible of Medically oriented Mental health care,"Drawing from history, culture, some Anthropology and Literature, Genetics, Epidemiology, Psychology and of course Medicine and Psychiatry, this is the Grand-daddy of Mental health texts. It also makes for a fascinating read (albeit in small chunks at a time) unlike texts in most other fields of medicine."
3,review of the book of psychiatry by saddock and kaplan,This book is not as useful as the synopsis of psychiatry by the same author. It seems to me that it is written for commercial purpose and not to communicate information. Thats because some of the text in the synopsis is reproduced in the comprehensive text about psychiatry. Taking its high price i do not recommend it for you to buy it.
1,EGO TRIP,"This book has no original ideas, says nothing positive about any subject, has no theme except ""I am so smart and all others in the world are so stupid.""I kept looking for another message, or some indication about what might take us in a better direction but could find nothing. It was discouraging to be required to select between one and five stars.... as without that requirement my rating would be ""Less than Zero!"""
1,More whining all the time from frannie,"I look forward to the day when Francis Wheen will use his considerable inteligence and talents towards saying something instead of just being, you know, clever."
4,Worth Reading,"While I may not agree with all of Wheen's conclusions, his overview of history is broad in scope and quite masterful. Proponents and detractors of his positions alike will benefit greatly from this unique, often hilarious and pertinent critique of the world since the year 1979. No one is spared in this lampooning of superstitions, ""gurus"", and general irrationality.An engaging and serious (but quite funny) take on the West's fall away from the principles of the Enlightenment."
2,"I wish I liked it better, but it was impossible to do so...","Man, how disappointed I was with this book. The title was very attractive. I am one of those taken by surprise by how ""mumbo-jumbo conquered the world"", denying a lot of the advances made by science. Reason is losing, and losing badly...So, I went for this book thinking it would be a case of ""preaching to the choir"" and that, naturally, I would enjoy it. My mistake. And why? Because the book has one ""simple"" flaw: it's badly written. It's badly organized. It's almost a mumbo-jumbo about mumbo-jambo...The author change subjects at will, often without introduction from one topic to another. The writing style seems like some angry and disgusted fellow spiting his views to his friends in a pub. The examples quoted to support his views are random and generic.I don't recommend this book, even if by default I, for the most part, agree with its ideas."
2,You should have read this book in 1986 when it was relevant,Some funny parts but the events are really old. Thatcher? I was like 2 years old. Its hard to get outraged about a few offhanded comments she made.
3,"Steamy, Erotic, But A Bit Rushed","Although I highly enjoyed Ms. Kenner's story I can't help but feel that the story was rushed in places and as a result I felt a little cheated, and at times confused as to how different conclusions were arrived at by Jack.The chemistry between Jack and Veronica was beyond steamy, and fun to read about, but I also like suspense in my romantic suspense books and that is the portion that I felt was rushed. Someone is stalking women and leaving erotic notes behind. All of a sudden the stalker starts to kill his victims. Why? Although that question is answered I still came away with big questions.Still this was a fast paced (perhaps a little to fast paced) book with plenty of chemistry between the main characters. Ms. Kenner has great potential and I look forward to reading more from her in the future."
2,1/2* Overkill,"Fascinated by the idea of bridging erotic literature into a romantic suspense thriller, seasoned Harlequin writer Julie Kenner embarks on the steamy Silent Confessions where detective Jack Parker seeks to ferret out a stalker who ruined her cousin and murdered a trail of women leaving verses from Victorian erotic literature like Lady's Chatterley's Lover and The Bourdoir. Veronica Archer the scholar who opens an erotica bookshop is the link to the suspects. She helps him with the clues while Jack fulfils her passion. The sexual scenes stacked in a monotonous chain soon lose direction and even appear contrived, diminishing the development to the central characters. Ms. Kenner's latest lacks the chemistry sparks that her romances are lauded for and the denouement to the mystery seems far-fetched and perplexing. The romance just did not blossom smoothly with much details at hand - and also Ms. Kenner's obsession with the racy scenes. It proved too much of an overkill."
3,No surprises here!,"This book is quite sensual and perhaps erotic. If that's what you're looking for you've found it. There is however very little suspense and a weak story line as well. Most of the book involves either sex or thoughts of it. The culprit is evident from the start as is the outcome of the relationship between Ronnie and Jack. I really wanted to like this book because the idea intrigued me, but unfortunately I was a bit disappointed."
5,Good quality magnifier,"The optic was very clear with no color distortion. The housing is sturdy, all metal construction held together with machine screws. I expect to get years of use from it."
5,very nice item,This loupe is very nice. It's easy to use and very clear. I bought it on recommendations from other people here on amazon and it definitely lives up to the 5 star rating it had. I use it to keep an eye on my jewelry and know if anything is wrong and needs to be repaired. It's excellent.
5,"Durable, good quality",A good loupe at a reasonable price that is built to take the abuse which will come from field use.
5,Look Closely!,I wanted a handheld magnifier for plant and insect identification and this loupe exceeds my requirements. The field of view is quite good and the casing is well constructed. It is a good value at going prices!Don't let the pictures fool you: loupes like this one are still ridiculously small and often seem to disappear in your daypack. Consider purchasing this loupe with one of the optional clip-on neck lanyards (sold by Amateur Geologist) to keep it at hand.
4,10x Triplet Loupe - well-made,This loupe seems to be a well-made product but I'm not really an expert. The clarity is very good. My only surprise is that I thought it would come in a case but it did not.
2,Beloma loupe,Poor quality. The screws loosen and it comes apart. Not high quality! Unhappy with this item. Optics seem good....Beloma loupe.
2,"good looking, but...","It is a good looking machine. the portafilter handle was broken in few weeks. I wrote and call to the seller without any positive answer.The coffee leaks over the portafilter.The coffee is good as my old oster espresso machineI wanted to like this machine because of its looks, but it really disappointed in its performance."
1,No Spare Parts,"The machine is excellent in design and performance.However, the plastic handle on the grind holder broke, which I suspect happens often. VillaWare tells that they carry virtually no spare parts and that I must junk the $350 machine because this poorly designed and essential part broke."
3,Nice machine poor parts,"I have had this machine for over a year and the grind porta filter is broken. My solution was to take the portafilter from my Gaggia machine that still works fine. It now works perfectly. In fact, better than the original filter.I'm not sure on the availability of the filters through gaggia carrezza model."
3,Would've Given 4Stars If I Could Get Spare Parts,"I've been very happy with it, except now both my portafilter handles are broken. I naturally assumed I could get spare parts, and found these reviews while searching for spare parts. I didn't see any spare parts, or even any espresso makers on villaware.com, but I haven't emailed them yet. Another review said Villaware informed him/her that they keep very few spare parts. I'm certainly not going to junk my machine, though. I'll just get a wooden dowel, drill it out, and use Heavy Duty Liquid Nails, or an epoxy. I'll stain the wood black and polyurethane it or something."
2,Good Looking but falls short,"I just received this machine and was excited when I felt how heavy it was. It is a good looking machine. The pump is nice and quite. It has strong steam....but the portafilter handle is the cheapest one I have seen in a long time. I have a krups machine and the handle is much much better than this. The other problem is that it has a filter basket which is pressurized. It doesnt help and from the espressos I have been making, it doesnt compare to less expensive machines. It doesnt even come with a single espresso basket. When you use ground coffee, you end up with a basket full of water at the end because it doesnt make contact with the brew head.I wanted to like this machine because of its looks, but it really disappointed in its performance. I cant recommend to anyone who knows what a good espresso is. I am not a coffee snob, I use starbucks pods in my krups and get what I consider good espresso with a very nice crema. This barely makes any crema at all."
1,"Back products, bad company","I'd give Villaware zero stars if I could.Bought a cookie press for my wife a few years ago, she used it 3 times and the plastic tube split on the 3rd time. It was normal, room temperature dough and the tube was less then half full. The company does not stand behind their products, they tell you to buy a whole new one.I'll never buy another Villaware product of any kind."
3,Not too many details...,"This book is great for fans of Christina who haven't read anything about her, but if you are looking for a book with a full detail of her life up to now, don't read this book. (For a book with more detailed and updated information about Christina, I would recommend reading ""Christina Aguilera: A Star is Made"" by Pier Dominguez.) It provides a brief, 48-page biography of Christina's life up to the release of her debut album, and has color photos on every page. Like I said, it's a good introduction to Christina, but don't read it if you want details."
5,when worlds collide,where do i begin this book took my breath away a page turner long but worth read a must read you want be disappointed i slow down reading this book because i did not want it to end one of the best book i ever read i give all the glory to mr. shawn forbes i wish he would put his second book on kinlde.
3,"Bad smell, good comfort","I bought two of these sweatshirts last year, but hardly ever wore them at first. They had a weird, plastic-like smell to them that made me self-conscious when I left the house. Now, after dozens of washes, the smell is finally gone and I wear them regularly. I like the generous fit and color choices."
3,unpredictable sizing,"i own several of these sweatshirts; LOVE the colors and the fabric (very soft, comfortable, and non-pilling)...but the sizing is all over the place! i ordered men's xl, and some colors were WAY too big/arms WAY too long...and some colors were snug fitting. it definitely makes ordering a crap-shoot! i'd love to give them 5 stars, because when they fit appropriately, they're great...but you can't count on it. too bad."
5,Fleece Sweatshirt,This item was exactly as described. I will order more. I have 2 of these now in demin blue & purple. I love them. They are so comfortable with a nice fit. The stone-washed look is great!
1,Amazon--Lousy Product Description,"Hard to find in the description that is a YOUTH size large. So you might want to make sure you're ordering an adult shirt, not this children's shirt. Even the picture is misleading. An adult in the same shirt, with a young boy fishing? The focus is on the adult! Amazon, get it together. This was a waste of money, and I'm not going to waste an hour of my life waiting in the post office to mail this back."
1,Total waste of money,"If you're looking for a great 100% cotton sweatshirt -- keep looking; this isn't it. You might be thinking the price is too good to be true for a quality product and you would be right. It only took minimal wearings and a couple of washes to discover that this sweatshirt does not hold its shape at all. The whole shirt stretches out as to be almost unwearable, but the cuffs and bottom are the worst offenders in that area. That's where you want a snug fit or an elastic 'give.' This purchase was a huge disappointment."
5,The best Cary Grant book ever,"Out of all the Cary Grant books there are, this one is the best i have ever read. His wife and daughter agreed with this book so you know that everything in it is true. As for people talking about his sexuality....if you read this book you can tell he is definately not a homosexual. I loved Cary Grant from the movies i saw him in and after this book i love him even more because after reading this you feel you really know him. And to know him is to love him."
5,GRANTS THE WONDER THAT WAS CARY,"Ten years ago I wrote the Kirkus Review you may still read under ""Editorial Reviews"" on the left, and can only commend my brilliance as well as Nancy Nelson's. This Grant bio, much of it from his own charming mouth and from those closest to him in his later years, has not been bettered since it first appeared. I called it ""engaging, warm, and solid""--I should have added ravishing. This is like having dinner with Cary Grant. Grab it, you will not be disappointed."
2,Good Book Bad Description,"Great book. . but this is a read a-long book that requires a CD or a cassette tape to go along with it, which was not included.Not a good value without the audio"
3,Ho Hum,"It's a good CD to put you to sleep, but a bit on the insipid side as far as the performance is concerned."
2,windows vista for dummiesI cannot follow the instructions,"I cannot follow the book - I am looking for a simple ""send"" or forward whick eludes me - how to ""save"" pages - favorites are too confusing for me. The book is really too complicated for me. I have been on heavy pain meds for years which probably killed some brain cells - I cannot find or follow through simple things with this book. Before this I had MSNTV2 - it took foreever but was so easy for me to work. I am stuck with a book I cannot understand. Thank you."
1,Short life bungee balls,"Good price and timely shipping, unfortunately the elastic bungee material is already breaking after only being up one month. I'm guessing they have been in storage too long....."
1,Major disappointment.,"I bought four of DMA (Dance Music Authority) Eurodance CDs in the late 90's, which I liked a lot for lifting & exercise in general. Everyone's tastes are different: for me, a polished club techno thing seems to drive the adrenaline. Almost every track on DMA's earlier CDs were very usable. But I couldn't find ONE on this CD that I could STAND. There are no fresh sounds anywhere here. It all seems heavily redubbed retred rehashed. Granted: you gotta hear a tune to know its sound, but with this one, I wouldn't even bother."
1,Best Avoided,"The wire is very light guage and broke repeatedly. I ended up discarding this cheapo antenna wire and replacing it with 14ga solid core, available in 500' rolls at the local home center for a reasonable price. No problems since!"
1,waste of yuor reading time,Another book tries to imitate Da Vinci Code historical conspiracy shtick . Waste of time and money.The plot is beyond ridiculous.I will not read any book by this author again.
1,Stupid,"Stupid beyond belief.His history is wrong.His geography is wrong, although I assume that he did a lot of (tax deductible) traveling, he can't even get the geography around DC correct (Google maps anyone?).His reading of the constitution's 25th amendment is a joke.He keeps referring to the world's three major religions as Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Apparently, he has never heard of Buddhism or Hinduism.Save your money. Save your time. Save your frustration level."
3,"Mecca, part of Jerusalem?","Knowledge is power and the Alexandria Library contains centuries worth of documents, among which are maps, manuscripts, translations, that purport to show that parts of Saudi Arabia are really sites of ancient Jerusalem. This sets off a race between agents of the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel to find the Library's location and the Librarian in charge. Double crosses turn out to be triple crosses plus some."
4,The Alexandria link,"It is a good reading. Steve Berry might be very interested in ancient history, because I noticed, the factual portions are true"
4,No such thing as a bad Steve Berry novel,"Like all Steve Berry's books, The Alexandria Link continues to be a great read, and full of interesting historical references - be they true or 'perhaps'. I am not going to write about the plot - that's already been done and anyway it will spoil the read. If this is your first encounter with a Steve Berry novel, I envy you as you still have all the others to read for the first time - and the second time, et etc"
2,"Good story, bad writing","Waaaaaaaaaaay too much description of the setting! Seriously, 1/3rd of this book could be eliminated, chalked up as irrelevant. The storyline itself, though, was really good. A completely enjoyable plot, once you get through being dragged through an architectural tour of a ton of different historical sites."
2,Rush to publish?,Berry seems like so many authors - by the time they earn a best selling reputation there best work is done. Maybe it is the outside pressure or time constaints put on authors with big contracts and printings.This book seems like 1/2 great idea merged with 1/2 a rush job to get out his annual early year book.It was so much a formula action adventure story. His usual thoroughness and depth is gone replaced by ridiculous double agent stuff!The story was too big and had too many players for its length.I gave 2 stars - bad book plus interesting ideas.If this book sounds interesting and you haven't read his first 3 -read any of those.
2,Entertaining but offensive,"The Alexandria Link is an interesting story, but I found the pro-Palestinian bias to be quite a stretch and quite offensive."
2,The alexandria link,"I got this book for free when I went to a free screening of Sweeney Todd which was sponsored by The New York Times. The book was not bad but I felt like I was watching National treasure. The beginning of each chapter was really frustrating because I was always, ""wait who are these people again"". The story was poorly organized the author could have added some clever conversations. The dialogue was so stiff."
2,"Ermmmm... No, keep your hands off that credit card!","Firstly, the middle east conflict would not end if this book is true.You merely relocate the problem elsewhere in the middle east (and if I can boldly say; if this is true, the political and international crisis would be even worse!).I think I would stay away from Steve's main character in this book after this. We see him in another of his book as well (I didn't enjoy that too).The plot-within-another-plots are just too many. I doubt it's because english is my second leanguage that I lost track of the story line.At the end of my second day or reading, I gave up and jumped the pages and read the last 5 chapters. I could guess what happened in between (and I wasn't too far off after I managed to complete it).In short, not worth it."
2,Author's Political Bias ruins book with flawed historical background,"Blatant historical inaccuracies throw this book off-kilter right from the beginning. An unsupported reference to a contentious massacre that never happened but was attributed to the Jews sets the stage for some anti-semetic retoric, totally unacceptable in a book with a historical undercurrent. It is the first time I have ever wanted to put a book down and ask for my money back at the book store. The author does himself and his readers a disservice with this type of approach. If you can avoid the undercurrent of personal politics you might find the reading entertaining, even if a bit farfetched."
4,The Alexandria Link,"Five years ago, Cotton Malone saved George Haddad, a biblical scholar with secrets about the lost library of Alexandria. Now Cotton is the only one who knows how to find George. When the government files on Alexandria are hacked, Cotton becomes a target for those wanting the information. Contained in the library are documents that could change the entire world. Many interested groups are prepared to kill for them; each with their own agenda.This is a fast moving, action packed book, as was the first in the series (The Templar Legacy). The reader is given the opportunity to solve the clues right along with Cotton, and there are plenty of close calls that have you wanting to skip ahead a few pages and make sure everything turns out ok!The subject matter didn't grab me as much as the Templar Legacy, and the plot meandered a bit in places. Despite this, the novel was still an enjoyable read and I'm looking forward to continuing the series."
1,Extreme pro-Palestinian antisemitic propaganda.,"Since the first pages this book gives you a twisted misrepresented of days prior to establishing the state of Israel. The ""Children, women , and elders slaughtered by Jews"" , clearly sounds like something that you could read from a Hammas terrorists web pages. I was really surprised to hear these words from the pages of accredited bestselling author. I do not understand how this propaganda was allowed to be published. Clearly someone pulled some strings... I suggest you skip this book, unless you're a strong supporter of Palestinian terrorism, and are seeking to donate your money for this cause!"
1,Total waste of time,"I am really tired of ""Da Vinci Code"" clones. This was boring - no character development - and full of plot holes. It is sad to realize that it will probably be a best seller."
1,The Alezandria Link,Short and to the point. Written for a younger audience. Very shallow plot like an old serial.
2,Have you ever read the Talmud?,"The first blunder of this book is that you can't understand the Old Testament without reading the Talmud. Here SB went far away explaining that Noah sent two different birds to check if the deluge was finished. He told us that there are problems with the story of Abraham and his sons. He hadn't have to go that far, in the first page of Genesis, the first day of creation God made the light. In the third day He made the sun so:What's the difference between the light and the sun?If you want to know you have to read the Talmud because reading the Old Testament without reading the Talmud is reading only the odd pages of a book... if you do that you won't be able to understand the book because you'll be reading only half a book."
1,Ridiculous!,"I really don't care about whether the book has historical inaccuracies; that's why it's called ""FICTION"". But what I could not stand was the plot's complete lack of plausibility. The author is almost trying to mimic the formula of the success of the Da Vinci Code but fails miserably. Da Vinci Code succeeded because it was able to interwove the historical facts and fictional aspects and made them BELIEVABLE and entertaining at the same time. However, this book does neither. Characters are very stiff and shallow, often you don't understand why and what they're doing, and the interaction between the main character and his ex wife is so cheesy that it's like reading conversations between two junior high kids. Save yourself from wasting hours of your life by NOT reading this book."
2,Same old thing,"This book continues on the same pattern as the Templar Legacy where a small bit of interesting history is used to string a whole book together. There are the same assortment of characters from the previous book including the Angry, controlling mother figure that makes me feel that the author needs more time in therapy. In this book, the bit of history is too thin to warrant 460 pages of contrived drama.Lastly, I am truly annoyed by authors who feel the need to make political snipes as part of their books. I surely won't be buying any more from this author."
3,PC,"The writing is OK, but the PC and anti-Christian viewpoint ruined the book for me. I have read other books by Steve Berry, but this one was the worst when it came to anti-Bible viewpoint. Sorry Steve, this is the last one for me. Stick to the truth next time and leave your opinion out of it."
3,"Entertaining, but unoriginal","A well written novel that does well by drawing the reader into the story. But the premise is week and poorly researched. The author's understanding of Bibilical History and classical Hebrew are limited at best, as is his knowledge of the literarly devices commonly used in Classical Hebrew.Having said that, this is yet another attempt to discredit Biblical truth, both that of the Jewish faith and of Christian faith. It seems every author has to try it at one point. Yet all who have tried have succeed only in showing their ignorance and unwillingness to accept truth.I do like this author, though, and if you are able to look beyond these shortcomings, you will probably enjoy the tale."
4,Gerry's Thoughts,I enjoyed the story even though it was not what I expected the content to be about.
4,It's FICTION People!,"I have to start my review by saying it's written on the premise that this is a fictional tale. This is real history mixed in with fictional history (Berry gives an explanation at the end between the fact and fiction used in the book). I also loved the DaVinci Code, which is also some fact/some fiction, and when reading it in that context, it too was fabulous, just like this book.This was a great read and a great story. I am a fan of the classics and I just found the whole idea of actually having the texts of the Library of Alexandria still around fascinating. I think Berry did a great job of laying out how the scrolls would be kept and the importance they would have to the rest of the world.Berry write exciting, fast-paced and fun-to-read books and I would definitely recommend this one! Read it in the spirit of the book it is - a great adventure with espionage and mystery mixed in."
1,dreadful,I really wanted to like this book- as I enjoy thrillers that use historical references- yet this seemed a paint by the numbers book- populated by characters that were as real as cardboard cutouts- appalling book in every respect
1,Horrible waste of time,This book isn't worth the effort. I can't believe I actually finished it. It is full of complete historical inaccuracies and misrepresentations. I am glad I am not the only reviewer who detected an antisemitic undertone. Please avoid this book!
3,Exciting read,"If you're looking for a fun, exciting book, this is it. It's full of intrigue and nonstop action, and it has an interesting historical background. To all the pompous, biased reviewers, no, it's not going to be classic literature; no, it's not filled with the greatest writing;no, it isn't anti-Muslim or racist; and no, all the historical information isn't necessarily accurate--IT'S FICTION!! It's an enjoyable read, and that's enough."
2,Da Vinci Code Clone,"It wasn't awful but it wasn't fine literature either.It reminded me a lot of the Da Vinci Code to the point I was wondering why the publisher allowed it in the first place. I would have thought Berry would like to be more original.Nevertheless, it was an easy read. It provided a nice break from serious literature but I wouldn't read it if you are looking for anything new."
4,The Alexandria Link,"This is a great CD book. I drive at least 80 miles a day, audio books like this one makes those miles fly by"
1,Poorly written and just plain silly,"I hardly know where to begin - Berry takes every cliche of the spy and mystery genre and mixes it with laughable dialogue, wooden characters, and totally unbelievable action. There's definitely an anti-Israel bias but even that I could get past if it weren't so badly written. Definitely save your money!"
2,The Weak Alexandria Link,"While the action was okay and moved along, the characters never enter the magic place where you care about them. You keep hoping this will happen, but the ennui is relentless. The end of the book is highly forgettable. I know this because I read it last week and can't remember the end! I do not go to movies. I read and buy much more pleasure when I buy a book. I am sorry I bought this one. I think it is a way to capitalize on The DaVinci Code stuff. (At least that was interesting and semi-educational."
1,Anti-semitic and poorly written,I was listening to the audio book version that I checked out of my local library and got through about 3.5 cds before I called it quits and returned it. Really glad I did not waste $ on this one. I'm a big fan of the thriller / spy / mystery genre but this book was a real let-down. The strong anti-Israeli bias of the author left a really bad taste in my mouth. Not recommended!If you're looking for a good book in the same vein try The Echelon Vendetta by David Stone or The Collectors by David Baldacci.
1,Fiction? Indeed!,"This book is fine for readers for whom real history is irrelevant. For those who prefer accuracy in their history-based fiction, look elsewhere. This isn't it."
3,Entertaining,"This book was an entertaining read. The plot was engaging, but tended to be a bit repetitve at points. But if you're looking for a fun read, this would be a good choice."
1,Poorly written awful piece of rubbish,"The Alexandria Link: A NovelThe plot is ridiculous - based on a fantasy developed by a faux-historian and presented by the author as fact. To add insult to injury, it's also poorly written. If Steve Berry had been offering a money-back guarantee, I'd have taken advantage of it. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,watered down poor man's da vinci code,"This is a watered down, poor man's version of the da vinci code. The realtionship between the main character and his ex wife is the only strong point which lead itself into another book. For the most part, this is could be a Nicholas cage film that goes straight to video."
3,A FAIR EFFORT,"This is not a bad CD, but it is not angelic singing as one reviewer suggested. This is mainly for Bette Davis fans, and as most people would realise, she talks more than she sings, so this is just vintage stuff. I must say, though, she does an extremely horrid version of ""I've Written a Letter To Daddy"" and virtually ruins an otherwise beautiful song, so I must agree with the reviewer who points this out. Overall, it is a fair effort, but not for everyone."
1,Bette Davis sighs,"This is a reissue of Bette Davis' fist (and only) album. Miss Davis recorded it when she was 67 years old. I want to say something nice about this album. Ummmmm, I like the caricature of Bette on the album cover, that's all I can think of. Miss Davis has a singing voice only a drag queen could love. She can't carry a tune or stay in the right key. This album features her singing some songs from her films, as well as other material. One of the ""highlights"" is ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy"". Bette singing is bad enough, but on this song she attempts to sing in a little girl's voice. I think this qualifies as audio torture. Buy this CD at your own risk!"
4,Works great but wears out fast!,"Like many other reviews, this thing works on toilet rings like magic. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it wears out rather quickly. By the time my toilet shined like new, a third of the stick was gone (Admittedly the toilet was quite ugly to begin with). No big deal. But buyers like you may want to know this."
2,Use Vinegar instead!,"Think about it. If the stain is from acidity in the water taking copper from the pipes, say, and depositing it under the tap (or the like) - vinegar will wash it away in a trice. There may be other great uses for this pumice stone - but I was just scratching my porcelain bathtub unnecessarily. Someone I talked to had read a book on the chemistry of cleaning and gave me the tip. The blue washed away easily."
2,Less than what I expected,"I used a pumice stone in the past but haven't been able to find one in retail stores, so I purchased this item. It's no better than a scouring pad.With a regular pumice stone, I could easily remove a ring stain in the toilet bowl without any scratching of the porcelain. With this scouring stick, the lime stain could not be removed even though I wore down one-third of the stick just trying it in one spot. I didn't even bother to tackle any kind of rust stain.I left the stick on the shelf above the kitchen sink and, ironically, found my US Marine Corps son using it on a stain from a tuna fish can that had been left in the porcelain sink. He was putting all his muscle into it and Nada! So I whipped out my can of Bon Ami and voila! the stain was gone.He kinda took it personal. I hear him using it in the basement on who-knows-what as if he's on a mission to prove it's effective for something. If I happen to hear an OohRah! I'll let you know."
5,This thing is the BEST!,"99% of the cleaning products available (@ Target, Walmart, or other grocery stores) are pure garbage. They are overpriced, cumbersome, require you to keep buying THEIR proprietary refills, and DONT FRIGGIN WORK! Pumie is cheap as dirt and works better than all of them. I found it at a Smart and Final. Wherever you decide to buy one, just buy one. Buy two and three and four and give them to your friends. They are one of the few quality products left on planet earth.Bless the folks at Pumie.<3"
5,Yay!!!!!! Finally!,"Like this product needs any more positive feedback....but I still want to say that it is one of the BEST cleaning products that I've ever purchased!! The ugly nasty brown ring in the toilet is finally gone! It used to bother me a lot seeing those brown areas in the toilet and I wasn't able to get rid off it no matter how hard i tried to wash them off. I was so pleased with the result that I immediately ordered more and gave some to my friends. I'm certain that they will find it useful too. And the best part is that this is not chemical so it won't harm your skin or cause any environment issue. At first I was worried that it'll leave scratches in my toilet but it did not! Try it, you won't regret it."
5,Genuinely pleased and surprised!,"I never leave reviews on anything, but this time I must. I moved into a room, and the bathroom had a permanent toilet ring that nothing could remove. By nothing I mean CLR remover, powdered toilet bowl scrubs, or any other toilet bowl product. This took some elbow grease, but my toilet looked brand new after. I was AMAZED. If you have a toiled ring in your bowl, don't waste your money just get this!"
1,Not so heavy duty...,"Bought this to remove some stains in a pool, was gone in less than a minute. Would not recommend for any heavy duty use, no idea if used on porcelain, etc if would have lasted longer."
5,As promised,Great at getting rust off tools and lime off the porcelin tub. Found them at Menards so saved me A WHOLE LOT on shipping charges.
5,My toilet is scarily clean! @.@,"Pumice stones are the greatest gift a single girl can have when company is coming over. After using this product, both my brother and my mother asked me if I bought a new toilet. The thing looks like new! Sparkily white!"
3,US Pumice HDW-12 Heavy Duty Scouring Stick TV Non-Branded Items,Worked good a 1st...but after you get it wet it stinks....have to keep in a plastic bag or it makes my room smell!!!
3,Could be better,This is among the mid-pack in usefulness of all the pumice stones I've used to clean the hard water deposits from my toilets. This item crumbles too easily. I got lucky awhile back and got my hands on a really good scouring stick that lasts a long time. This isn't one of those.
3,brick = pink,"the product itself is fine. but i ordered a sweatshirt colored ""brick"" and recieved a sweatshirt everyone calls ""pink"". back when i bought it there was a different picture. but the picture i see there today is the ""brick"" sweatshirt, and this new picture does look the way it really looks."
1,Don't Buy It,"This is a piece of junk.I read all the reviews before I bought this and I can't believe they liked it.I feel ripped off! The sleeves are short while the front and back are long.It's over sized for the LG size I ordered except the sleeves.It looks nice and comfy and thick in the pic but it's the opposite.Only thing that's nice is the color Mocha I ordered. Oh yeah it smells toxic when you get it,it says to wash before wearing."
2,Disappointed,"This book lacks organization. I cannot believe I paid $6.95 for a magazine. It does have 330 ideas, many of them similar. It should have some age suggestion, some psychology stuff. How do I explain to a 3 year old and 6 year old that I will be in and out of his/her life due to military commits. A lot of the suggestions involve candy. I don't know what I am looking for, but this is not it."
1,A big diappointment,"I bought this book because the review indicated it would be like the book I want to write-- telling a history of the westward movement through the lens of my own ancestors. The problem is, unlike others in this genre who do it so much better-- Blue Sky Dreams by David Beers, Joan Didion's ""Where I was From,"" and others, this does nothing more than relate facts about people we don't care anything about. The book lacks an overall narrative arc, a protagonist one can care about, or compelling writing. I think the author's relatives would enjoy this book very much."
5,Great!,I have this in my little boy's pirate themed room. I was looking for a parrot for decoration and this works as that and for entertaining him! Very well made. Nice size and great colors. I would recommend.
4,"As the title says, It's slow... but still charming","Although it's in docudrama style, several of the characters play ""themselves"" in this charming African tale about a baby elephant named Slowly. Real-life married acting couple Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna (who played George and Joy Adamson in the 1966 film Born Free) return to Kenya where they meet up with George Adamson (portraying himself in all his oddball glory) and his cavalcade of exotic animals including cheetahs, lions, rhinoceroses, buffalo, ostriches, and pachyderms. Bill and Ginny find themselves the reluctant adoptive ""parents"" of three mischievous baby elephants named Slowly, Kadengi, and Eleanor (who, of course, wind up causing all kinds of comic situations and stealing the hearts of everyone who gets in their way).Staci Layne Wilson"
3,Slow,We ordered this because we have enjoyed Born Free and the other one about the otter. They are both first rate. This one was uneven in the story line and appeared to be something that was thrown together rather than something planned. Still I am glad to have it in our collection.
3,"The Damned ""popiest"" album","After the experimental ""Black Album"", the Damned move into pop rock territory with Strawberries. The first four tracks ""Ignite"", ""Generals(probably the Damned's most underrated song)"", ""Stanger on The Town"", ""Dozen Girls"" are all excellent. Unfortunately, those four tracks are the best the album has to offer. That's not to say the rest is a wash. ""Under The Floor"", ""The Pleasure and the Pain(the Damned's best ""slow"" song)"" and ""Gun Fury"" are also good. But after its excellent opening the rest of the album never reaches that peak again. Its still a worth while purchase for Damned fans but not the first album that I would buy from them."
2,Cash Maker,"Wow, you say! Three discs full Hendrix tunes for only 15 bucks! What a deal! Not quite. Disc 1 has NO HENDRIX AT ALL, it's only Little Richard with an amatuer guitarist recorded in the early '70s. Hendrix did record with Richard, however, the songs aren't included here. Disc 2 is split between more fake Hendrix tracks and some actual ones recorded in a bar (the Scene Club, NYC)in '68. The actual tracks are rough sounding and can be found more complete elsewhere. Disc 3 is mostly Hendrix (exception - Two and One Goes) when he played back up for Lonnie Yougblood in '66. Not bad, but nowhere near what he did with the Experience. All tracks were lifted from vinyl LP's. For collectors only!"
2,criminal to promote or sell this,"It's criminal to promote this material, I'm sure Ed Chalpin had something to do with it. This is sub standard Hendrix and for anyone that realy loves his music, they know that its criminal to sell this. If everybody sabotaged Ed Chalpin it would do Jimis memory much more justice. But is there any real justice in this world? When it comes to Jimi Hendrix (a man who was solely interested in music) there isn't because every one is trying to exploit every little mistake he ever played onthe guitar. And isn't it funny how Jimi himself said"" I hear people are imitating me so much they're even copying my mistakes"". Get rid of these substandard releases."
3,"Failed To Become The ""New Supremes""","The second album from the ""New Supremes"" follows the same route the trio's debut took; new jack styled beats, samples, covers, and never risky vocal hooks. Motown would only release two singles from the three ladys' second shot at becoming the new Supremes before pulling Just Call Me off the shelfs. Though the album wouldn't out sell the trio's winning debut album, All for Your Love, records sells, and chart positions have nothing to do with the material on the Good Girls second LP. The beats are funkier and the production is above average. The finest moments are ""Just Call Me"" and the second release ""It Must Be Love."" Nothings been heard from the Good Girls since 1996. They appeared on LA-based female rapper Yo-Yo's successful Black Pearl (1992), and the trio's first release single ""Your Sweetness"" (1989) appeared on the soundtrack to First Kid (1996)."
2,"Mediocre, uneven songs here in this album","The Good Girls opted for a sexier image on their second album in 1992. If you look as Destiny's Child's current album cover, it's very similar to that sexy image. But people failed to notice. I like the first single that had a smooth dance groove on it, but it stalled in the 20s on the R&B chart. The second single I hardly heard on the radio. But the rest of this album contains some very mediocre and uneven songs. There's none of the excitement that the 1989 debut brought. Sometimes it's tough for a girl group whose members become 21 or 22 to follow up a solid debut that they made at 18 or 19. You have to deal with mature themes and you've still got to keep your edge too for the second. This album didn't have that, had a few forgettable songs and the songs don't connect or blend well. Had too many producers on it too. Sorry if I'm harsh, but they could have been around as long as Destiny's Child and they didn't take it up to the next level enough."
2,Disappointing Workout,"I am a believer in working out at home with videos. I have always worked out during pregnancy with a home video. Since I am working on baby number seven, I have used many, many pregnancy videos. This one was a dissapointment. They really could have done a better job at making it enjoyable. I was unable to leave the volume up high enough to hear the background music because the instructor was constantly off-sync with the beat and it drove me crazy. The routine itself was very repetitive and somewhat boring. I could only force myself to do the tape about three times. I gave it away to my unsuspecting sister when she was pregnant."
4,Enjoyable workout,"I have tried several prenatal workout videos, and this was one that I was able to repeat on a regular basis. The aerobics section was easy to follow, and keeps me in relatively good shape without making me feel exhausted. It is definitely not as cheesy as Denise Austin's video and the women who are in the video actually look pregnant. The toning could stand to be a little more difficult; I like supplementing the floorwork/toning part of the video with the Buns of Steel 8 toning section."
1,What's the point.,Money was spent for nothing. It does not write: the ball is frozen up after use for about 5 minutes. Last one I got leaked immediately. The fine point refills must be old.
3,Devotions for a Sacred Marriage: A Year of Weekly Devotions for Couples,This is a mild book it aids in generating discussion. I had expected more scripture. Gary L. Thomas has written many Christian help books and his other titles are worth reading.
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE This book,"What a great way to remind you how to be a great partner in life! If you are married for 50 years, just married, going to get married or just in a long term relationship this is a must read!"
3,Sacred Marriage Devotional,"While the devotional is a helpful companion volume to the Sacred Marriage book, it is not as helpful as it might be - the once-a-week format and few reflection/discussion questions limits its usefulness."
5,Just started....LOVE,"We just did week one and I love this author! The way he writes is perfect. You aren't being preached or even talked at, you are being spoken too like you are friends, and are right in front of him. He is funny and pretty straight to the point. I love it, very happy with my choice."
5,this book is my guidance to my marriage,when i read this book it opened my eyes to the way God saw my husband and how i should treat him. This is a great read its a year devotional but i finished it before that.
5,excellent for any marriage,We have been married almost 40 years and this was one of the best devotional books on marriage that we have read.
5,Beautiful Rimsky in the right hands.,"What a surprise this CD is. I was looking for a credible recording of the VERY Rarely recorded Legend of Kitezh and I didn't want to spend $30+ for the Jarvi 3CD set. So I tried this one.Well I have to tell everybody who shops here that this is a FINE performance with SUPERB sound quality. Both are rich and warm with wide dynamic range and realistic front to back depth which is often the bane of classical recordings. The word luxuriant comes to mind.The Berlin Orchestra is well known, but I had never heard of Jurowski. He is excellent. In his hands the music is colorful, exciting and dynamic. He has also recorded some of the other Rimsky suites and I can't wait to try them out even though I have many versions of all the Rimsky comps. The only ones I like better are Edward Serov and The Odense SO on Kontrapunkt. Otherwise these are as good as anybodys and at a more reasonable price. You can't go wrong with this as a first choice."
3,it's aight,"with da exception of the touch and especially dnh songs, da rest of da cd is kind of jacked. da artists are phat as hell, but the songs need some work"
3,One album wonder - Fuse,"I got this CD by mistake thinking it was related to the current Lifehouse. Let me state this, Fuse is totally different. Fuse released this album called 'Circumstantial' and then faded out of the music scene after 1992. This album has 6 songs and none are particular good to write home about.What could've been? Well if they stayed around long enough they had talent."
2,To bunched up,"This is not a very clear book. The author just throws everything ever written about a God or Goddess without it making any sense. There are better books out there, but this is not one of them. When you look up a Goddess, it should say what she was noted for and any dark side she has. The author throws word after word without any explanation. An example: Odin was best known as a God that gave us the Runes and searched for knowledge. The author calls him a God of the underworld. Really? Odin is not known in any book I ever read as any underworld God. If you buy this book you are going to be very confused about what these Gods and Goddesses did or stood for. It is just to thrown together."
5,Mary's vineyard,This is one of the most beautiful tributes to Mary that I have ever read. At the beginning of each month there are thoughtful ideas to pray about and each day the meditations remind me of the many facets of Mary's life and appearances. I have selected this book several times as a gift. Beautifully illustrated. Dani
3,Microsoft Student,"A good 1.0 effort, but targeted at the mediocre middle-school student. For high-school, to say nothing of the college freshman, it should have the ""adult"" version of encarta rather than the ""kiddie"" version, and the math & physics sections should be expanded to handle at least fisrt-year calculus, if not AP calculus & AP physics."
3,Not quite enough,"I was disappointed in this product. I think it did everything advertised, but I expected more. The math part was pretty much useless withouth signing up for the additional cost service. It looks like the templates are very useful though. My 10th grader thinks it will help her a lot."
2,Sneaky Mircosoft Deceptive Monopoly,"In normal print ""Include tools designed for Mircosoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint""In much smaller print (Requires Office XP or Office 2003, available separately)Why should anyone give Mircosoft money when there are tools available separately that will enable piracy of their overpriced software."
2,Disappointing - Hoping for Future Improvements,"Better off buying Encarta, disappointing Xmas present for my kids. Was expecting integrated student assistance with academic knowledge areas as well as administrative support tools such as scheduler, grade tracker, PIM, etc. Also disappointed by MS Office XP or 2003 requirement.For this current version, I would recommend that you hold off buying this product until Microsoft improves it."
2,Why not buy Encarta 2005 instead?,"At this price, and with most of the goodies in Encarta 2005 (which is now being ""remaindered"" everywhere), go for the old Encarta 2005 and save, save, save..."
1,The advertising is a travesty!,"I simply cannot believe how misleading the package is! I just wasted 70 bucks on this schlock... I quote the package ""applications included: word, excel, powerpoint, outlook"". Nope. Not a one! It has help for geography homework. I'm thirty years old and I don't have homework. I've never been mugged, but today I got robbed. Don't buy the product on sheer principle of the matter."
1,Would love to tell you but the CD was blank.,"I don't know if Amazon got a shipment of these, but I ordered two (returned the first one then got a replacement) and the second one was blank too.I wonder if anyone else had this problem."
3,"fun, safe, cheap- you get what u pay for","I bought it, had to use someone to help me put it up. Simply put, fun, cheap somewhat sturdy, you can flip spin climb etc. but here are the cons. my ceiling has the bubbly/popcorn paint. it messed up the paint and now i have a bald spot there. im only 145 lbs, the base, which is plasctic, snapped one day after me having it for 4 months or so. its better on carpet to me and you can only spin in one direction, spinnin in any other direction will unloosen it and the pole will fall on you. so if you have the cash buy a better pole, if not this is okay just be careful. and it makes noises sometimes, kinda makes you not want to even spin on it at first. if you buy it, bolt it to your ceiling! i didnt but should have."
1,Poor Quality,"This product does not install. I put together just the way the instructions and dvd show, however the pole did not secure and was wobbly. I even hired a handy-man to try to install the pole and he had the same results I did. I would not recommend this item."
3,"Not bad for the price, but will probably end up buying x-pole","Assembly is easy and is fun. However, even with proper assembly and after being bolted into my apartment ceiling (hope the landlord doesn't notice), the base still slides and the plastic nuts around the base hurt your feet if you're not careful. Before I decided to bolt it into the ceiling, I tried a simple spin and the entire pole collapsed (I only weight 120 lbs.). It is fun for parties and less expensive than other poles, but if you plan on doing any advanced moves and not getting good homeowner's insurance - spend the extra $100."
3,"couple ""fixable"" problems","By far provided one of the best nights I've ever experienced,but,it was not as simple to put up as portrayed, especially when you're not able to drill it into the celing b/c you rent! You have to have the help of at least 1 other person, and tightening it to a ""safe"" position takes a lot of persistance. But once it's up properly..hours of fun..especially when vodka is involved.."
3,get what you pay for,The pole looks cool and is sturdy if you have the proper ceiling and floor. It doesnt seem to work well with the spinning. I weigh 130 and i guess it wasnt tight enough and it spun right off with me. Would probably work great with proper place for it.
2,Don't waste your money,"The order arrived in a decent amount of time (especially since I'm overseas), but after that I really don't have anything good to say about it.The product arrived to me faulty, I contacted the seller to see if I could return it and receive another one, he did reply, but with an email asking questions about the product. I told him the problems and he said he could send a replacement piece, but after that I never heard from him again.I suggest going ahead and saving up and buying an X Pole. They're better quality, come with a warranty, and maybe you won't get the run around if you do have a problem."
1,do not buy this if you seriously want to learn to pole dance,"If you seriously want to take up pole fitness and not just sway around the pole spend the extra money and buy an X-pole or Lil'Minx (which are strong, durable, totally portable, and safe!). This pole is made from chrome plated plastic! It is not sturdy at all, even when screwed in permanantly. You can't spin lefty or even lean against because it will collapse. It's not even safe for beginners let alone advanced or professional dancers."
4,Electra Pole,"The pole its self is very east to install, my boyfriend and I had it up in about 10 minutes. It does have the option to bolt it into the ceiling, but I didn't find this necessary as it was very sturdy as it was.If you do decide to leave if unbolted, make sure you test it before you use it, and everytime thereafter as it occasionally needs tightening.I was slightly disappointed that it didn't come with a D.V.D that would show a complete beginner what to do. [...]I think the product is well worth the money, it pays for itself in fun, and it will get you into shape in no time."
3,Good For the Price,I considered this pole as a cheaper option to the XPole (which I wound up buying). The biggest flaw in this pole is that if you are left hand dominant your spins can unscrew the top support. Perhaps the demo I saw was not set up properly but it started to loosen when doing spins! If you are going to do minimal spinning I would say go ahead! It really is a fine pole for the price!
1,Not worth it,"I bought the CE pole. What a disapointment! Hard to put together, and itDOES NOT spin. Save up your $$ and get a professional pole."
1,Disappointment,"I had high hopes for this one. But, it just did not deliver, in my opinion. The story is a familiar one for the horror genre, but the sub-par script and storyline really killed it (pun intended). I must say, the torture scenes were rather unique and the gore factor seemed on par with other similar movies...that's really the only plus. Since I purchased it, I may give it another watch before trading/selling it. If you're considering seeing this, rent it first."
2,Klee without Delight,"The images on the DVD aren't as clear as you'd like. The biography is cursory. There is no linkage with museums/cultural sites. There is no investigation of how Klee developed his unique style.If you are buying to show to elementary students, it'll do.It sure didn't jazz my socks."
1,This movie is awful.,"If any of you have seen the All Creatures Great & Small television series, as I have, do not buy this movie. It is downright awful. The actors go through the motions and there is no warmth of the characters in the movie version. It lacks humor and Helen is not at all like the character in the TV series.Don't waste your money on this movie version."
5,ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL!,"This television movie based on the best selling autobiography of country veterinarian James Herriot came before the popular BBC television series. Simon Ward, Anthony Hopkins and Lisa Harrow star in this charming little tale about the new vet who moves a to Yorkshire farming community in the 1930's. Along the way he not only wins his neighbors over but also finds romance. Directed by Claude Whatham, this 1974 film does not have the depth of the television series, but you can clearly see why people would want more of the same on a more regular basis."
3,Save Your Money,"The All Creatures Great and Small movie is okay. Nothing at all wrong with it. But for those who have seen the television series, this movie does not compare well."
5,A very heartwarming story...for all animal lovers,"An absolutely ""marvellous"" story about two very special cats. I was very impressed to learn about Maria Dickin who was born in 1870 and founded the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals in London in 1917. She solicited volunteer services and devised many ways of raising money in order to help stray animals and animals owned by the poor who could not afford veterinary treatment. During World War II, many animals also served their country and several received a ""Dickin"" medal, including Faith and Simon, the two very wonderful, brave cats in this book. Animals do have a 'sixth sense'. Enjoy!"
5,It Worked!,"I gradually gained fat after I became 40, and tried Callanetics and several Pilate videos but they did not work on me. In addition, they were too boring.NY City Ballet WO was fairly good (for its gracefull atmosphere and to get good posture) but neither worked on my fat.But this one worked!I did it only 10 times in recent two weeks, and my waist became two inches smaller and my tummy is getting flat!In addition, I feel energized (not exhausted) when I do this video so I believe I can continue doing it until I regain my best shape.Thanks Donna for your cheerful and effective workout!"
3,Way Complicated!,I don't consider myself to be uncoordinated and I actually taught aerobics (admittedly it was 15 yrs ago) so I thought I would be able to follow along without much problem. I was just lost! The steps and moves are complicated and she does them for such a short period of time that you never really get the hang of them before she's adding something else to it. I was very disappointed because Donna is fun and energetic and I really wanted to be able to do it with her. The arm and ab work is good and I enjoyed that - but I'd say you need to be very familiar with aerobics moves if you're going to be able to follow along in that segment.
1,Disgusted,"This video was shown in my 9th/10th grade Biology class. It was completely inappropriate for people my age. The view of a male's [reproductive part] inside a women's [reproductive part] was so not necessary. It was not a drawing, but a real picture through a camera. The real live birth uncensored was also inappropriate. THey don't even show that on the discovery channel uncensored. Also the heat image of a [male reproductive part] becoming erect, 14-16 yr olds don't need to see that!"
4,Make sure this is the info you're looking for!,"Video was very well done, however much of the focus was on the act of conception. I was expecting more on the development of the fetus, which felt crammed into the last portion of the video. However, it was a good way to get my non-reading husband a little more interested in the entire process (aside from making the baby, that is)."
1,DVD is a bust!,"After having this phenomenally outstanding production on DVD replaced three times, I finally came to the conclusion that the DVD was simply a terrible transfer.The resolution is awful.What a shame to do this to such an outstanding film.Skip the DVD until it's redone."
2,Sex ed,This DVD is basically the sex ed you got in public school. I was disappointed when I wasted time watching and the last ten minutes covered babies.
2,slightly misleading,"I bought this video because I wanted to learn more about pregnancy and childbirth after I found out I was pregnant. Based on the video's cover, I expected it to be about humans. The video is so broad and offers only a few minutes of actual footage that I was interested in. I felt like I was in science class and bored for the most part. It is an informative video, but not if you want to know about what is happening with your developing baby."
4,VERY EDUCATIONAL!,"YOU KNOW WHAT DONT LISTEN TO THOSE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!THIS IS THE ONE DVD EVERY HOME NEEDS THIS IS REALITYAND IF YOU CANT COPE WITH THE CONTENT?! DONT BUY IT ITSREALLY THAT SIMPLE? YES IT IS EXTREMLEY GROSS FOR SOME,BUTHOW ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO KNOW? THEN DONT WATCH IT IN FRONT OFKIDS,THE AGE MUST BE CHOSEN ""CAREFULLY""!! FOR CHILDREN TO WATCHAND AS PARENTS IT IS ""YOUR"" RESPONSIBILITY!! SO REMEMBER THAT!GREAT FILM IN ALL ASPECT OF HUMAN LIFE!!"
2,Not for everyone,This documentary makes false assumptions that Evolution is a proven fact. Aside for the evolutionary gibberish it's okay.
2,Not as good as stated...,"I bought this DVD a short while back from Amazon with great expectations. This video was made in the early eighties and it shows it's age. This video was marketed as a great aid for expectant parents. On that premise, I decided to purchase it. The video starts off talking about cells and how life got started on earth a million years ago. I was disappointed to see that the first 30-45 minutes didn't really talk about babies at all, but more the fertilization process. There is a short segment at the end that shows a few different stages in the pregnancy, but not nearly enough. I also bought Life's Greatest Miracle by NOVA at the same time. I was a little disappointed in that one too, but it shows more of what I was expecting to see. Whatever you do, don't buy both as I did...A lot of the stuff is redundant. Hope this helps."
3,"For schools, not new moms","Good video for scholastic purposes, but disappointing for expectant mothers... I bought this with the idea of seeing what my baby would look like at various stages of pregnancy, but that isn't what this offers. After a long explanation of the fertilization process, they skipped quickly over the actual fetus growth process and straight to birth."
1,puzzled,I ordered The Miracle of Life based on the product description of a DVD running time of 186 min. What I received was a 60 min DVD. I'm using it as a Christmas present and it is too late to return it and it also remains unopened so I cannot comment on the DVD content.When ordering this product be aware that the product delivered is NOT as advertised.
3,Amazing,"This is a startlingly close look at the making of a baby, and really makes you realize how beautiful life is. My big concern is its imablance--lots of footage of pre-conception and conception, and then only a few images of the embryo and fetus, and an unsatisfyingly quick overview of the birth. The early parts got me excited about life, and then the sudden ending left me empty. I wish they had covered all the stages of ""the miracle of life"" in equal depth, and made the film longer. In other words, this is a remarkable study of the earliest stages of pregnancy only."
2,Nova - The Ultimate Journey,"The photography is wonderful however, I found the outline to be misleading. The video starts out covering the preconception and conception phases of human development. It quickly changes focus and spends about 40 minutes comparing the human fetus to that of a fish, chick, and pig. Too much time was spent covering theories of possible links between all land and sea creatures. This left about 10 minutes to sum up a 10 second delivery and show toddlers at play.This video did not flow well and left you frustrated waiting for more concrete information."
4,Still an awesome educational journey,"I saw this 15 years ago in my biology class and now that I'm 6 months pregnant, I was curious to see it again. Absolutely fascinating and rich in detail. I do wish they'd spent more time showing the fetus at the various ages--it stops at 18 weeks--but overall a highly educational and captivating journey."
4,Classic educational film,"I have used this video in teaching college courses many times over the past ten years - there is no better film showing the development of sperm and egg, the journey of the sperm to the egg, and mystery of how they join. It is NOT primarily about prenatal development or childbirth. It is about the incredible feat of conception itself. My only beef is that it incorrectly states the prostate to be the major source of seminal fluid (only 30% is from there - 70% is from the seminal vesicles)."
4,a health teacher in middle school says,"As a middle school health teacher, I am always on the lookout for videos that will educate AND hold the kids attention. The Miracle of Life does both well. A few caveats: the beginning few minutes give a very strong evolutionary flavor--can be easily zapped through if so desired. The birth at the end of the video, while very well done and not scary for adults, is a little much for young viewers--I omit it for my 8th graders. There is no doubt left by the video about when life begins--the moment of conception is the beginning of life. I would have liked more fetal development, personally, but the parts on the reproductive systems and how they work is nothing short of outstanding. I love the sense of wonder and awe this video leaves my students with. This would be outstanding for any health program, 8th grade or older."
2,A Mix of Interesting and Boring Parts,"I'm not sure how to categorize this book - history, comedy, psychology. It does a good job in describing some of the most hysterical manias over the course of history, but not in a very exciting manner and I'm not sure to what point: no deep motives are presented and no conclusions are drawn. Some frenzies are described in too much detail (like in the case of 'The Duels') while others are very succinct (like the case of the Tulipomania).Overall there are some interesting parts but it's mixed with some very boring ones... I recommend it if the reader is interested in a plain history of Mankind manias.PS: By the way, it seems that we are not able to learn from the past. History keeps repeating itself..."
1,Overated,"Based on the previous 5-star rave reviews written here, I decided to give this book a try, especially since it's two books for the price of one. But when I opened up the book, I discovered that you don't even get Mackay's complete book; you get just the chapters relevant to finance/investing. Because I was reading the book primarily for insight into trading/investing I thought I would make do. However there was very little of that to be found, and when it was found, it was typically written in verbose, archaic English, sandwiched between many pages of irrelevant historical minutea such as how exactly transactions were conducted in the 1700's. There are a couple good gems, but nothing which has not been repeated in more modern books in much simpler language. E.g. The Money Game by Adam Smith or Market Wizards, or Mindtraps by Barach or any of Tony Oz's books. There are sooo many good trading books out there to read that reading this was a complete waste of time."
4,Shock Rock Kings,"Outside of Marilyn Manson, Judas Priest and Ozzy Osbourne, W.A.S.P. stands as one of the most controversial bands of the modern and post modern era. Debuting with the notorious Animal single and gold albums in the 80, tried to go mainstream as legitimate musicians. This CD was the first attempt to return to shock rock form, though fused with elements of industrial. The ensuing tour was just as controversial as the Antichrist Superstar tour: THE tour THEY didn't want YOU to see! Overall the music isn't bad and key tracks are the title track' Killahead, The Horror and U."
2,CRAP!,"I have been a big fan of Wasp since they released their first cd and i have liked every cd up till this one i bought it thinking wow Wasp has came out with yet another kickass album , not exactly , yes the lyrics are pretty cool and the song titles are cool but overall the techno crap has to go that's not rock n roll whatsoever rock n roll is like Last Command , Headless Children etc... not K.F.D yuck might as well buy you a gun and a nine inch nails cd and call it a day i still love wasp and they will remain my favorite band of all time but i do not reccommend this album at all ."
5,Mean Aggressive & RAW,The Title of the CD says it all. It is WASP the way i want to here them. If you liked their first CD and thought it was good but wondered if they could strip it down a little. Surprise this is it
2,Industrial W.A.S.P.!,"One my favourite bands of all time but this is definitely not my favourite W.A.S.P. album...it just dosent have the hooks, solo's, anthemic choruses that I love about W.A.S.P.If you like 90's grunge, industrial metal you'll probably like this...I love the 80's stuff...much, much better...this is too grim and lacks the hooks of the glorious 80's W.A.S.P. era.Blackie is one of the most underrated and best songwriters of all time but I think it's good he just got this out of his system and moved on to better records."
1,Was sent the 2nd edition,"I have to give this book a 1-star rating because I was sent the 2nd edition when I ordered the 6th edition shown on this page. I ordered the book used from a third-party vendor and said to cancel the order if it was an old edition, but they sent it anyway and Amz did not stand behind their guarantee because they said that the 2nd edition is not ""materially different"" from the 6th edition. If that is true, then the 6th edition is as badly out of date and lacking as the 2nd edition is."
4,NOT AS GOOD AS CROSS,"These fit my cheap Parker pen. I like the Parker, but the ink doesn't seem to flow as smoothly as my Cross pens."
4,Rollerball refill,Product is as advertised -a good roller ball refill for my Parker Pen and sent swiftly as promised
3,Bleeds like a woman on her period,"The title says it all. If you don't write fast enough, your writing surface will melt. The ink, however, is absolutely beautiful! The pen I bought it for is even better. However, the flow rate is a bit too high for me."
1,Check the fine print,"This item is *A* rollerball ink refill. Notwithstanding the title header of ""6 Count,"" if you look at the ""Product description,"" you'll notice the slightly obscure blurb ""Sold as 1 EA."" Maybe they broke open a six-count pack, but it's shipped as one per order. Consequently, when you factor in shipping costs, this goes from being an excellent price to being a horrible one.On the bright side, their shipping time is fantastic; I ordered the thing on Wednesday night and received it Friday."
2,Pen Refill,"My parker pen with these refills writes great. BUT....... they leak like a sieve. If you have the cap off and the pen is lying on your desk where your hand or forearm can touch it without realizing it ... it is like a sponge soaking up water. Constantly have ""spots"" on my forearm or hand from the leaking pen ... not a problem when writing. Does not leak when cap is on ... safe to travel."
2,Not the best,Most of this Cd is pretty awful. I love Rockabilly but this is not what I expected. Look somewhere else if you are looking for good rockabilly.
5,Received on time and in good condition.,I have enjoyed many of John McPhee's books. I'm looking forward to reading this one. McPhee almost always presents a movable feast.
4,"An interesting, quick read","Enjoyable afternoon of reading. This is an interesting work on both the birch bark canoe and travelling using one. While you may not come away from this feeling like a different person, you will certainly come away with a smile."
4,Happy with second best...,"Well, I don't know if it's the world's best cutter. It's straight-forward to use and a little unusual in appearance (which leads to comments during wine bottle opening ceremonies). My eleven-year-old son used it immediately out of the box with excellent results (and of course without reading the instructions). Clean cuts. A bit big for my aesthetic taste, but it does what it's supposed to do.My last foil cutter was simple to use and operate (coming with one of those elaborate opener fixtures), and the plastic disintegrated after only a year. This looks to be much sturdier. Time will tell.$9 isn't cheap, nor is it expensive -- I am satisfied.Postscript: It broke. I would say after about 20 or so bottles. The company immediately replaced it with a substitute -- not the same one. I noticed that it has been discontinued. It was still pretty cool and an attractive design. I would downgrade to 2 stars. Company service gets 5 stars."
2,Cutting Elements break quickly,"Worked pretty well for first (approx.) 5 bottles (although it requires a certain angular/pressure technique. Then the cutting blades (approx 8 inside the bore of the cutter) started breaking - I believe 3 or 4 have broken off so far (after 30 bottles). Unit still works, but requires even more dexterity/force. Not recommended. The simple foil cutters work very well; this unit needs a re-design."
5,Fantastic read.,"A fantastic read for anyone in the mood for ""that"" kind of book that captures you from page one. This publication will not only make you think, but will entertain you from start to finish. The Author's writing is lively, fresh, and very, very topical."
5,Finally!,"As pointed out in Jeffery Lang's foreword, converting to Islam is an extremely difficult experience, especially if you are a woman. It is so nice to know that I am not the only one who has struggled with a mostly-immigrant Muslim community that follow--and expect me to follow--a culture that is completely alien to me, as well as reinforcement that the only way I can possibly be true to my faith is to be myself. This is a much-needed book that provides support for those of us who are caught between two worlds--our culture and our Muslim community."
3,generic video,"This video was basically an easy take on a few familiar yoga poses. There was not a strong focus on ways the poses help the body during pregnancy, labor/delivery. It was basically just a handful of pregnant women in a room doing some asanas together. Maybe my expectations were a bit higher b/c I have been practicing yoga for several years and have taken a few prenatal classes. It is a good DVD to do to help keep active but I wouldn't rely soley on it throughout my pregnancy."
2,Not very impressed...,"Based on reviews, I thought this would be a decent workout. I'm not very active, but this really did nothing for me. The lady was kind of creepy too and a little too into ""connecting with your baby"" and not as much into exercising. If you want a workout, I'd checkout the 10 minutes Prenatal Pilates DVDs...those are quick and give you a mini workout."
2,Wish she wouldn't talk and actually do yoga...,"I am in my second trimester with my first pregnancy. If you are looking for anything somewhat challenging and to keep you in shape, this is NOT the video for you. I was in decent shape before i got pregnant and got this not having done much yoga before. This video is WAY to SLOW and she talks WAY to much!I would recommend ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" if you want something that will get your heart rate up and keep you tone and in shape during your pregnancy. I am also going to try the ""10 minute Solution Prenatal Pilates"" video."
4,Yoga Mama,"I took yoga classes pre-pregnancy, so the movements were familiar to me. I found that the instruction was on a pretty basic level, and was easy to follow. I just started in my 5th month, and feel I could easily continue until the baby is born. The one thing that bothered me about this video was her constant chatter and quick transition between movements and poses. Perhaps its because I came from a live-instruction atmosphere where there was more time to strech into the positions and really get tuned-into your body and breathing in each one. The choice of exercises is good, but she does a maximum of 3 repetitions each movement,which I don't feel is enough. Also, she talks so much, the ""relaxation"" exercises at the end are kind of pointless. I can't relax in 3 minutes with her chatting at me the whole time. But overall, this video is good to keep you feeling limber and centered,even when you feel like a house on legs."
4,Good for us moderate yoga enthusiaists,"I have been practicing yoga on and off for three years, and I this video has satisfied my urge to do yoga while pregnant. I'm currently 5 months pregnant, and I didn't do any yoga after I found out I was pregnant until I recently bought this video. The poses are not very hard, but they are fine for me. Additionally, I'm recovering from abdominal surgery as well, and this video allows me to get in some much needed exercise and stretches while my belly heals. I like the fact that the video shows alternative ways to do the poses, and the women in the video don't all look like super tough pregnant aerobic instructors. The only thing I would have liked is a few more minutes tacked on to the end that focused deeper on relaxation.If you're a hard core yoga person, you will find this video too easy. Otherwise, try it- it's worth it!"
2,Corny,This is a 20 minute video. The instructor ofter giggles while she is talking and tells you to smile at your belly. It was annoying. It is more of a quick stretch routine than a yoga workout video.
3,"Nice for a change, but not very engaging","I'm new to yoga and must admit not very flexible. Few poses, like hip opening poses are very hard to do. The same time, I don't feel like I get much of a work out, or stretching done. Instructor spends too much time talking while you're just standing there waiting for a pose demostration. I much more prefer ""Prenatal Yoga"" with Shiva Rea as an instructor. But Crunch Mama is good occasionally, when I'm feeling lazy."
3,Good for Those New to Yoga,This is a great video if you are new to yoga. It feels great at the end of the day and is really relaxing. It is a nicely paced video also. The reason it got 3 stars is because the instructor is extremely annoying. She talks to you like you are 5 years old and generally has an irritating way about her.
3,It's full of ish-ness,"I am a little new to yoga and enjoyed this video immensely, though I would not suggest it for your sole source of exercise during pregnancy. I found the instructor encouraging though slightly annoying. If you are looking for an actual workout out of this video, please look somewhere else, if you are looking for a relaxing yoga-ish routine, this could help. I workout a couple hours daily and found this a decent way to get rid of some of my aches and pains."
2,talks too much,"This DVD is probably good for people who have NEVER tried yoga. I consider myself a novice, but I've taken beginner classes, so it's a bit too slow for me. The teacher talks through almost every pose, even when there is nothing critical to describe, which I find distracting. Her rehearsed commentary is a bit too fru-fru for me."
4,easy and simple yoga,I am not a yoga person. I thought I would give this a try because yoga is suppose to be a great prep for labor. I actually liked it. It was easy and the stretches really feel good. I did not find it overwhelming to do. This program really made me relax. It is better than some of the other programs that I have tried.
2,Disappointed,"I have been doing yoga for about 5 years now. This video just did not seem to flow. I would have liked more stretching and loosening of the muscles. The instructor was adorable and fun, but more fit for an aerobic type video. With yoga, I would rather see a calm, almost ""ethereal like"" instructor. I like Shiva Rea's Prenatal much better!"
1,"horrible video, poor quality, poor instruction","Crunch is a neat brand, but they missed it with this prego video. The instruction is poor, the set is dull, and the workout is below average."
5,Love this DVD!,At first I thought this DVD would be cheesy but I really like it. The exercises are fairly easy to do and it really helps once you get into your 6-7th month.
1,Slow moving,"This was much to slow moving for me. I found myself getting agitated because it seemed to be dragging on and that is definitely not what you want out of yoga, to be agitated."
2,A very simple yoga routine,"I did not enjoy this yoga routine at all. I ordered it because I wanted a shorter workout than my other CDs, but this was a real disappointment. Perhaps it's OK if you're a beginner, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who has done any substantial yoga before pregnancy. I also found the instructor's chuckling throughout the CD annoying and really not in the yoga spirit."
3,Very slow,"This video would be great for someone who is new to yoga or hasn't exercised much. If you have done yoga previously, this vidoe goes very slowly and poses are very easy and quick."
5,Great tape for Yoga beginners,"This DVD was a real help relieving all this new pregnancy-related tension and discomfort, and as an added bonus really helped me with stress. I almost fall asleep at the end of the tape because I am so relaxed. Be careful if you are new to Yoga - I am, and I twisted some muscles out of whack in my back a few times. I find if I just stretch to MY comfort level and not try to imitate the actors, then it really helps. Pace is great, and moves are explained in enough detail that you don't have to look up at all while in a pose. Highly recommend!"
2,Too easy for some moms,"This tape will disappoint if you are at all in shape and have any body awareness. It is designed for moms-to-be who are either deconditioned or who do not exercise on a regular basis.The pace of the workout is so easy and the instructor proceeds so gingerly it's as if she's teaching physical therapy or rehab patients. Also way too much sappy commentary. A normal, healthy pregnant woman could handle a bit more challenging pace. Contrary to what another reviewer said, inversions and most yoga poses are NOT contraindicated in low risk pregnancies. I have verified this with my obstetricians. On the contrary, many doctors are now encouraging more robust physical activities.I also agree with another reviewer who said that there is too much talk between poses.It seems to take 10 minutes to even change positions. No flow whatsoever."
5,Great prenatal yoga dvd,"Since going from a yoga practitioner with a challenging vinyasa practice to someone who is completely fatigued all the time, this video is perfect. Instructions are clear, you don't have to mess with props other than a chair for those in the 3rd trimester. The dvd includes half salutes, triangle, side angle, wide leg forward bend and alot of floor work, including down dogs, all at a very easy steady pace. I just wish the hamstring stretches were held a bit longer. This dvd is alot better than Shiva Reas Prenatal Yoga dvd, when I'm exhausted from a day in the office as well as dealing with pregnancy symptoms, the last thing I want to deal with is messing with chairs and thats for everyone, even those in the 1st trimester have to use the chair."
2,No thanks.,"I love yoga and have a few Living Arts and the Ali McGraw tapes. I am not a certainly not a master yogi, or even close, but this tape was way too basic. The music and the studio backdrop get old after about 5 min. Finally, I could not handle the instructor telling me to say ""Hi"" to my baby while performing the cat tilt pose. I have to give this a thumbs down-way down."
3,Beginners Style,"This is an extremely basic yoga video which would be excellent for anyone who has never done yoga before. As someone who has done yoga pre-pregnancy, I found all of the excercises a little too basic, and after doing the video, I wanted to do some 'real' yoga. The instructor does an excellent job of pointing out differences and modifications that should be made for pregnancy. Also, it is not 'new agey'(a plus in my book). I was a little turned off by the giggling and smiling every time the instructor talked about the growing baby inside of us all and rubbed her belly."
4,I love this tape,"I bought this tape during my first trimester, and I am still using it 24 weeks later. I have yet to become bored. I like the fact that they use women of all shapes and sizes. As I get closer to my due date, it has become more challenging, but I feel relaxed, and it helps with back pain and leg cramps."
2,Instructors voice and demeanor is too peppy for yoga,A short little stretch session (20min). Instructors voice and demeanor was too peppy for yoga. The workout was unchallenging and uninteresting as well.
2,Slow and kinda boring,Good for beginners and maybe fatties. I think I did this yoga workout 3 times total in 9 months. There are better pre-natal DVDs out there.
3,"OK, but instructor is annoying","I wasn't crazy about this DVD. The instructor is very annoying. She makes suggestions about pregnancy and labor-related things, and giggles as she says them, like she's insecure about what she says so she can't act serious about it. I appreciated the variety of body types shown and that they had a woman doing the poses in a modified manner. I found the whole atmosphere to be too ""hip gym"", rather than relaxing, meditative yoga. I also found the workout to be too easy, with very little focus on the all-important Kegels. I much prefer Shiva Rea's yoga workout."
3,Okay video. Too sappy and long winded.,"This is a good video to get an idea of what poses you can do during pregnancy. I've been doing yoga DVDs at home for a couple of years and needed some extra guidance for prenatal modifications. There's not enough explanation of why the poses are benficial to a pregnant woman. Would have liked a little more info about what not to do in yoga while pregnant, so I could modify some of the poses in some of my other tapes which I actually like.This doesn't give much direction beyond finding the pose and the instructor making some corny remarks. The breathing pace seemed off as well, especially if you get winded easily as I do since I've become pregnant."
2,Low level workout,"The tape wasn't educational in how it explained why moms-to-be were doing the poses instructed. Additionally, it wasn't much of a workout just long rests with fill-in talking."
2,Irritating yoga misses the point!,"Smug. That's the only word that can describe the instructor and assistants in this video. If you practice yoga on even a semi-regular basis, you'll find this video to be nowhere near challenging enough- even when very pregnant. Add in the ""smug"" factor and you'll end the workout more stressed out than when you started. Save your baby the video-induced preeclampsia."
1,Save your money,VIdeo is appropriate for someone who doesn't want any kind of stretch or workout whatsover. I had to fast forward over the parts where she keeps babbling on. She could not speak any slower.
