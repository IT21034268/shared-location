2,Not as good as I hoped,"1. It never successfully connected to internet or sent email via using the wifi or wlan.2. It does not have a generic text editor that can be used to open the text file of different file type qualifiers, such as a .cpp or .java file without first needing to rename the program files to a .txt file.3. The editors in the phone do not have the ""Save As"" option and are rather primitive.Maybe Nonia simply does not care what the users need?"
2,Very Disappointed at Nokia E61,"I am a business executive and heavy user of PDAs. I was very satisfied with the Sony Clies and Palms I have owned along my life. The Symbian system used by several phone manufacturers is EXTREMELY LIMITED in terms of program availability.Regardless of Nokia's marketing of E61 as the state of the art in telephones, they should be more concerned about the FULL CAPABILITIES they may offer. For a device that claims to be supportive to executives, it lacks programs for productivity and even games (yes, executives like good games too), so common and assorted for Palm OS products.I am sorry I won't be able to exchange my device at this moment, since I just bought it!What a poor deal."
4,Good book.,I think the book used a lot of scare tactics which threw me off but other than that it had me hooked.
4,Amazing book that makes you want to keep reading,"This book is a great book to read. It tells that believers are sent to heaven while the non believers stay on earth. The non believers stay on earth worried about the people they love who disappeared. In the book the whole world is in chaos. The characters are Lionel, Ryan, Vicki,and Judd. Ryans mom and dad were not sent up to heaven. His dad died in a plane crash while his mother in a car crash. I think though the ending was bad because they did not tell if they all went to heaven. The other kids also lost loved ones during the rapture. They were left behind and all alone. Luckily they found a church so they could be baptized and go to heaven.Reviewed by Darin C."
3,"OK, but not the best","I have really enjoyed some of the books in this series, but I do not find this book the best. I think that it could have been done better, but I do like the main point of the book-Jesus coming back to take his true followers who are left alive and standing on the earth. I really encourage you to read this series and I would say to buy this book at a low cost!"
3,"Adults reading ""Left Behind"" - give this book to your child!","If you are an adult, and have read any of the ""Left Behind"" books, and you have any reading children, you owe it to your children to give them a readable account of the same story. Not recommended for very young kids, ""The Vanishings"" only covers about a third of the first book (and thus doesn't do a good job of explaining why these kids were ""Left Behind""). If you want your children to understand why you liked ""Left Behind,"" this is a good starting point. My daughter (age 16) was ready for ""Left Behind"" after reading the first three books in this series."
5,Left Behind,"In the book it tells you about 4 kids who are lost trying to receive Christ in their lives, before Jesus comes back. The 4 kids find each other But you have to read the book 2 to see if they receive Christ. I realy liked this book because it helps you be prepared for when Jesus comes back."
4,Very good!,"This first book of the Left Behind: The Kids series is very interesting. ""The Vanishings"" uses lots of scriptural references to try and explain about the end of the world."
1,Left behind,This book was awesome and very entertaining. It reaches you a lot of things. It is about four Kids who have Christian parents but they don't believe in Jesus or the rapture when the rapture happens they get left behind and need help
5,Best kids series ever - for adults and kids!,"As an adult who read all the Left Behind books, I found this kids series to be an huge extension of the series. New & old characters but same world events happening. Kids can learn much from this book -- adults too. I'm a fan!"
5,What an eye opening book to what may be!,Very well written. I have read the whole kids series as well as the adult . It sure made me think!
4,Childhood memories!,"I remember reading the entire series in middle school! Was very suspenseful and interesting to me at that time. I suggest this for someone in middle school/early high school, but the adult Left Behind series for those in the older grades-adult. I have yet to read the adult series, but it was highly recommended to me."
4,Great Read!,"I first picked up these books when I was sick in bed and had nothing else to read. I started them, bored, but I soon became engrossed in the story, and I couldn't stop until I had read all of it. The books follow the lives of four young people who are left behind after Christ calls all His children home. Judd, Vicki, Lionel, and Ryan are all from different families and lifestyles, but the occurence of the Rapture leaves them all in the same boat. There are some themes throughout the stories that I would recommend for older readers only, but I loved reading these stories. It's a good thing that there are 40 books, though, because I wouldn't have been content with any less!"
4,"Left Behind: The Kids V. 1 ""The Vanishings"" (FEBER)","This book was very easy reading. The book involves four characters: Judd, Lionel, Vicki, and Ryan. They are all ""left behind"", as the book suggests, after the Rapture, where Jesus comes down and takes all of his believers with him. The four, who are not true believers, set forth to find where their family and friends have disappeared and how they can follow them."
2,The ending was Left Behind,"What do you get when you take a twelve book series, and then write a teen version which covers a quarter each book at a time?Answer: A forty-eight book series.If that wasn't bad enough, the books read as if they wrote a full length novel and only then diveded it into four seperate books, not worrying that only the fourth book has a proper ending.An more economical and literate alternative would be to get the hardcovers, (Taken, Pursued, etc.) which put the four books corresponding to each adult title back into to one volume, as they were meant to be.So, for being only a quarter of the story, I've given this book a quarter of the available stars."
4,Andrew The Vanishings,If you like books that you can't put down...Or books that are sooooo exciting that you can't stop reading...Well then this book is for you. It's about four kids who face the world's last days together. And how they handle the disappearances of people all around the world. Will they come together? More importantly will they stay alive? ...
3,Bring it on,"The first book usually starts out pretty good. Not much violent, but a lot more tearful writing. The first book gives the reader a brief outline of the children's lives. Ryan, Judd, Lionel and the gang have their lives torn apart when their familes desappear."
1,Badly written propaganda written with ignorance,There are lots of really good distopian novels out there that show the complexity of morality and promote considered thinking of how societies work. This book is not one of them.This book prompted me to think how harmful a literal interpretation of the end of days is. It prompts unthinking individuals to sit back and do nothing to make the world a better place. It does not promote love and understanding at all.
3,"Good book, but in rough shape","I would recommend this book along with the others that go with it in the series, but the copy I received in the mail was in pretty rough shape."
3,Good for young kids,This series is really a good one for kids who are curious about the end of days or have older family members who read the adult series of Left Behind.Relatable characters who in untreatable situations that take them to the return of Christ.
5,Great book,Simply mystifying it gives you a lot to think about..... Can't wait until i get ti read the next one but i don't think anything can beat the first though.
5,Oh so inspirational!!,Absolutely and wonderfully inspirational!! Linda does an excellent job at explaining how to open the heart to LOVE!
3,"Worked for a little over a year, then broke","We purchased this door handle for our Camry in November of 2010, and it's broken again. It worked great until it broke, and I guess for the price that's what you should expect. Here I am about to buy another one, but only because it's better than no door handle."
1,"great pendant, terrible necklace","I bought this with full expectations of receiving a 20"" chain and pendant, titanium, brushed finish, and all that. And, yep, that's indeed what it is. My gripe stems from the fact that almost immediately I started getting a rash around my neck from the chain. I'm definitely not allergic to titanium. Upon closer inspection, I found the chain links on the chain to be *sharp*. I ran my fingertips across it and they caught on each link, and when you look closely you see the sharp edges on the link. Bananas. I like the pendant so I won't return it, but otherwise this would be back in the box and on its way to the customer returns center. Be forewarned."
1,chain,i just received my product today i am not at all pleased with the chain with this product. i was to believe that the pendant and the thin chain were both titaniumIt looks very cheap and no shine or sheen even through the plastic it came in.i was very disappointed when i opened up the box it came in.i feel very disappointed basically just paying $70 for a small pendant. The contrast between the pendant and the chain is too off colourim very hesitant about buying jewelry online now even more
5,Perfect Sharpener!,"I love this! I needed a replacement for the Anolon Advance Sharpener that came with my knife block set. I think my ex stole it, but that's an entirely different story. ;) This sharpener is better than the original because it's two stage. To use it, I hold the sharpener vertically so that the blunt end is resting against my countertop. Using the rougher side of the sharpener, I make five 15 swipes downward and toward me on one side of the blade. Then I rotate the sharpener 180 and make five 15 swipes on the other side of the blade. I rotate the sharpener back and make 2 more swipes on the first side of the blade. (This 5-5-2 technique is recommended by Alton Brown, btw. [...] ) I then repeat the whole process using the smoother side of the sharpener. My knives have never been sharper! I highly recommend this product!"
4,Very good knife sharpener,"I purchased this sharpener and about 4 other various sharpeners with different surfaces (diamond, ceramic, to have on hand to sharpen my knives. I am not an expert, I am a newbie and I wanted to experiment and find which various sharpening steels would help me sharpen my Wusthof Classic knives."
5,WOLFLAKE 12/25/12,SAW A FEW EPISODES AWHILE AGO AND WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED. IT WAS TOO BVAD THEY DID NOT CONTINUETHE STORY
5,Lots of fun unless you find yourself naked by a lake at night,I knew that this animal will not complete as with many a series. But if you wait for something to finish it you will not watch much.I watched the unaired pilot with the voice over by Series Creator & Executive Producer Rupert Wainwright and director John Leelley.1. Meat the Parents2. The changing3. Soup to Nuts4. Tastes Like Chicken5. Excitable Boy6. Four Feet Under7. Leader of the Pack8. Legend of Lost Lenore9. If These Wolves Could TalkThe series starts out like the unaired Pilot did not exist.Seattle Policeman John Kanin (Lou Diamond Phillips) just popped the question to his girl. She disappears maybe she never existed. He gets a call from Wolf Lake saying someone saw her. So he goes there to find that everyone is evasive. Is there some community secret or is he just paranoid. You be the judge.See Lou Diamond Phillips again in:The Dark WindSee Graham Greene again in:Mystery! Coyote WaitsA Thief of Time
4,"""Complete Series"" is misleading","I enjoyed what there was of the program. The show must have been canceled after less than a season becase it the final episode leaves you hanging, just like ""Alcatraz the Complete Series."""
2,"OH, PLEASE - YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING","Yes, they have done it agian. Music changes and edited for dvd release. "" EPISODES MAY BE EDITED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL NETWORK VERSIONS. MUSIC HAS BEEN CHANGE FOR THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT VERSION. I really wish they would at least give you some warning before you purchase. The enterainment industry is really taking this to far. Thay are taking great shows apart to the point you don't want to watch."
5,LOVE IT!,I loved this series when it was first released and was so disappointed when they canceled it. I was very excited to find it newly released on DVD!
5,IT OLD BUT IT VERY GOOD,BOBBY JONES HAS HELPED GOSPEL ARTISTS THAT IS CURRENT. IT WOULD BE GOOD IF WE COULD HELP HIM NOW. PLUS THE MUSIC IS JUST GOOD!!
2,Tarintino may have given this movie the thumbs up but i can't.,I purchased this as a blind buy only because it was starring Kevin Costner and Tarintino gave it the thumbs up.The story was oh so predictable and the acting for these class of actors not up to their usual great standards.The PQ at times was decent for the age of the film - 3.5/5The AQ was very good especially the opening credits with the jet fighter plane but after that the surrounds were not in use much. Speech was clear. 3.5/5Being a fan of Kevin Costner i was really looking forward to this movie but at no stage could i get into its groove. I was glad when it did end so abruptly.
2,Disconnected and confusing,"I've heard good things about the original version. I can only assume the director screwed up this version. I wish they would leave a good movie alone. Are their any ""Director Cut"" versions better than the original? In this case it was a screw-up."
2,Director's Cut is not good,"I have this movie both the DVD Theatrical release and the Blu Ray Director's Cut. Honestly, I think Tony Scott is an awesome director but not such a good editor, the story flows much better in the original release and Christian Wagner is a far better storyteller than Scott.For those who don't get what I am saying; imagine Pulp Fiction shown as a traditional movie beginning when Travolta buys drugs from Eric Stoltz to the moment in which Bruce Willis departs on Zed's chopper.I hope someday they release the orifinal version on BluRay, then it's going to be worth every single cent, and more."
4,Excellent Movie,Kevin Costner is excellent in this movie. Lot's of action and unpredictable ending. Excellent streaming from Amazon video. Would recommend.
3,dated,"a tony scott film from 1990 with a puffy, tucked in shirt wearing kevin costner. what more needs to be said?"
4,Good view,Good story and good acting. Could have made the action a little more intense but it does manage to hold your attention. I did like the final meeting of Costner and Quinn.
2,Ruined the original,"The full version of this movie is very powerful, never again will I trust an unrated directors cut. I'm guessing the director wanted to get a pg rating, I should have read the reviews. The original movie was very well done, make certain you do not purchase this directors cut. Revenge is a film with adult themes and should be left that way."
4,Appeals to the senses,"This film had the potential to be so much better, but despite its rough edges it makes for compulsive viewing. You'll find yourself going through a wide array of emotions, lust, guilt, rage and sympathy. The cast is awesome. The story compelling."
3,unbelievable star crossed lovers,"beautiful cinematography, well acted and it is always a pleasure to watch Ferrer, Stowe, Costner, Quinn, etc...but what a lame script! Hard to believe the wife of a mexican kingpin who is guarded by his own private army, would not know that he would spy on her, tap into her phone etc. Could the lovers be more naive? After falling in love, they should have hightailed it to the u.s and gone into hiding. But I cried a little at the end anyway."
5,Great love story- Tragic ending,"The passion between Costner and Stowe in this movie is too real.You feel for Costner's great love for this women in the sad ending to this great, highly underrated film. Give this film a look, you won't forget it."
2,GOOD CHEMISTRY & CINEMATOGRAPHY WASTED ON INSIPID 'PLOT',"Was this a western? Number of Mexican hats per capita would suggest so. Was it a romantic film with flaring passions gone awry? The sizzling chemistry between Stowe and Costner had me foxed. Was this a mafia theme with vengeful retributions? Quinn is convincing as a jilted, betrayed, and thus ferocious husband, so I half-expected a thrilling picture. Even Tony Scott's cinematography is servicable. Sadly, my refrigerator has expired eggs that stink lesser than the script for this utterly insipid dreck."
2,man on fire was much better,"i just didnt really like this film, it was actually very slow, nothing else to say except man on fire is tony scott's best revenge movie, so pick that film instead of this one"
1,I must seek REVENGE after watching this joke!,"This movie failed miserably in the box-office? Why? Because people couldn't understand its artistic merits? Its deep ideas? No. It failed just because the public is not so dumb as the executives think. The plot here is ridiculous, cheap."
1,Tony Scott's worse,Now let me just make it clear that I love tony Scott. His work ranges from mostly excellent to decent at the least but never really terrible. This movie seems like a bad Spanish soap. Not a fan of Kevin Costner either who isn't horrible but brings the same sort of blandest he brings to all his roles. If you like Lifetime movies then you might like this otherwise stay the hell away!
4,Overlooked and underrated,"I saw Revenge at the theater with a friend of mine. We weren't quite sure what to expect. We were both pleasantly surprised.Revenge is a tale about loyalty, friendship, love, passion and forgiveness. This is defintely NOT your run-of-the mill action film. In fact, the film has very little action, but when it does, the action serves the story, not vice-versa. Costner, Stowe and Quinn all give outstanding performances.The main thing that stuck with me through this film is the HUMANITY of the characters and the story. The plot was very down to earth and the overall tone was pretty dark and depressing. Not to give anything away, but the ending is not all what one would expect from this genre of film.If you're looking for something different, give Revenge a try. If you're looking for a feel-good movie with a typical Hollywood happy ending, you may want to look elsewhere.I am glad to be able to own this film."
5,Length Of Film?,Just one question.......why is this original release listed at 124 minutes and the new Director's Cut at 100 minutes?
5,Not for politically correct wimps,"The reason (and I dare anyone to dispute me on this) that this movie did not receive more fanfare is because politically correct WIMPS refused to give it the attention it deserves. Due to the brutal way in which Quinn's character treats his wife upon learning of her infidelity, the politically correct critics and moviegoers alike simply did not want to be perceived, in their idiotic minds, as being pro-violence towards women. ""If we say this is a good movie, then we would be saying that violence towards women must be good too, right?""Lunacy.But this IS a good movie and a good DVD: Great sound, excellent quality picture, well acted, interesting characters and great locations."
2,A poor example of the revenge genre,"Lets see here, Kevin Costner goes to go visit his good friend, who he knows is a major drug lord, can't keep it in his pants, and boffs said drug lord's wife. Actually, The revenge should have rightly been Anthony Quinn's... if I was a rich and all powerful drug baron and one of my gringo friends bopped my wife, I'd be looking for some payback too, especially if it was someone as smirky and annoying as Kevin Costner... heck I'd get revenge just for Waterworld and The Postman.As for the ""extreme violence"", as time has progressed and violence in films has become so extreme that it has become rote, the volence in Revenge no longer seems so extreme. All in all a disappointing film."
1,The soundtrack says it all,Boring! One can tell exactly what is happening by the sappy music. Did I see a different film than those who liked it?
4,Why two books for the Sierra Nevada?,"Pros:(1) Clean presentation and well organized information for each campground(2) Reliable recommendationsCons:(1) This is pointed out by other reviewers too: the cross reference of map, index page and the actually location of the campground information is cumbersome. Simply reverse the order of index page vs map, and prefix the campground index to each campground name in the description pages will help a lot with navigation.(2) My main complaint: dividing the Sierra Nevada by CA 108 seems quite arbitrary. I hope it is not done to making buying the Southern California Tent Camping book necessary. Note to author and publisher: why not combining the two books? The combined book can still be very handy field guide if the fonts andlayouts are made more compact. This also makes perfect business sense: every reader pays a bit more to get the benefit of a combined book."
3,eh.,"This book was just ""okay."" Only 50 sites were reviewed, and really, for Northern California, that's not even a drop in the bucket. Still, the layout is easy to read."
4,Great detail information about this camping areas,Each one of the trips are properly explained and easy to follow. The book is simple but packed with good information.
4,"Good guide, poor index","Overall I really appreciate this guide book but it's continually frustrating to try to match up the map page to the actual index and chapters- there's no logical connection, very annoying. But the overall content is great, recommend this one!"
1,Don't trust it!,"We packed up and camped at Castle Crags State park because Mai gave it a great review - despite that it was right near I-5 near Mt. Shasta - but he said it was great and not noisy so we believed him. The campsite was seriously RIGHT OFF THE HIGHWAY. You could see cars going by! The noise was deafening from every campsite, especially late at night when the trucks would brake and woke us up several times. We packed up and went to Lassen Volcanic Park and camped at the forest service sites for some peace and quiet and managed to save our vacation. Do not trust this book! I am never using it again."
2,pixie,This product is too difficult. The instructions don't give you details on how to do the things you need to do to care for this pet.
1,Order never received,My order was never received. Communication with vendor answered 2 weeks ago saying the product was in the mail. Which obviously it was not. $ gone with naught in return except a friendlier relationship with my postman.
2,Look Further,"Shelton's Turkey Jerky, 0.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)Taste: 1 Star = Extremely hard (like shredded paper) and little to no flavor.Gave 2 Star rating only because conveniently packaged in 1/2 oz. packaging which is what I was seeking."
3,Sabres to Scimitars without World Wars,"James D Lunt has two books on this subject, the other being simply titled '16th/5th The Queens Royal Lancers'.Sabres and Scimitars spans the years 1689 to 1992 and is well researched in the area of who commanded this regiment and it's related units. However, it is lacking in content about the REAL men of the regiment and sffers from skipping through the two World Wars with not much detail.It is well worth a read if are researching the originals of the Regiment but will not help you much if are trying trace more detail on a particular battle within a certain war.I have NOT yet read Mr Lund's other book will do so shortly and will therefore be in a position to compare them both.Happy Reading and Good Luck in your Research."
4,"Gary Cooper, Super Duper","Released in 1958, this is the ultimate western. Good guy overcomes adversity, and bad guys. The hero has a beautiful admirer(Julie London), who cares for him even though she knows he is married, with children. She knows he has changed from what he was, into her ideal man. I must say this script seems to bear no woman's touch, as her dialogue and situations are definitely male oriented. Be that as it may, she professes her admiration & new feelings of woman-ness to him. Boy are the bad guys played well! Real scum bags. Mr. Cooper is just so enjoyable to watch, and you know he is just being himself."
3,Man of The West,"It's a good old western, the kind I grew up watching. It's always good to see old coop in action. It's a good movie but not extraordinary. On big screen LCD the cinamatography is very good. Cooper is a reformed outlaw that runs into the outlaw that raised him. Cooper gets drawn into a set of circumstances that makes him a hunted man again but he chooses to do the right thing and saves innocent people. This movie was made in the days when the good guy wins."
5,Brilliant Cooper Western Ahead Of Its Time,"Here's a brilliant western. More than 30 years before Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"", Gary Cooper, writer Reginald Rose and director Anthony Mann explored the same violent terrain -- that of a reformed killer forced to face the monster within one more time. Mann had made several wsterns with Jimmy Stewart, but this is his masterpiece. Almost Shakespearean in its grand, tragic themes, ""Man Of The West"" deserves mention with the greatest westerns of all time."
2,won't ship for 2 weeks!,If you can wait 2 weeks before this even gets shipped then you'll be happy when you finally get it but it's much faster to get from the local fish store if you can't wait 2 weeks or longer!
3,Great in parts but not the author's best,Geoffrey Household wrote an absolutely amazing story called Rogue Male. Most of his subsequent 'adventure yarns' seem very minor alongside this great book.Watcher in the Shadows has many good and interesting moments (a tale of hunter and hunted in the English countryside with a nazi death camp survivor chasing down his intended foe - but with a twist)but is probably a mediocre read for most people.If you enjoyed Rogue Male then give it a try. If you would like to read a 'cosy' Britich thriller then try it - enjoyable but not up to Mr Household's potential brilliance.If you want to try a Houshold novel other than Rogue Male then I would suggest Dance with the Dwarfs
4,Recommend using in a race/ run,"I curled this up in my sports bra during a 5k run and during the last mile of the race, I whipped this sucker out and twirled it around in the air. WARNING: make sure you have a good radius, because you may ""whip"" others with it and they may not be happy with you for that."
1,"DON'T SETTLE FOR THIS ""OBSOLETE"" (2nd) EDITION!","Don't settle for less than the FINAL (third), much-expanded edition of this book:The Billiard Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition - An Illustrated History of the SportAlso, regardless of where you choose to purchase (the THIRD edition), don't pay more than the $129 (plus shipping) that the author himself charges for brand-new copies via his dedicated website. [By contrast, some THIRD-PARTY sellers have, unfortunately, appeared greedily eager to OVERCHARGE unsuspecting buyers by outrageous amounts.]"
1,This thing stinks!!!,"I got 5 different ones plus the tv thing for our kids. (Yes, I have six kids.) It's not even a week after xmas and none of them will play with it. To much work. You spent the better part of an hour digging for various items, money being the most important and then have to take your money to the store to buy things,like FOOD, feed the pet just to have the pet still be hungry. What a pain the the behind!! Even the oldest won't do it!! And I'm an adult! We are taking ours back for a full refund!"
2,Small print remake,"A shrunken down version of the original that costs way too much. Look for an original that is being offered used before thinking about buying ths book, unless the price goes down to under $5."
5,Garden Ways Joy of Gardening,"GARDEN WAY'S JOY OF GARDENING by Dick Raymond, is a great resource book. I use it all the time. Enjoy all of the tips they are great"
4,great resource,I have the original from 1972 & bought this one for my son. Updated format but still the same knowledge base. Great book for beginning & experienced gardeners alike. Plain & simple how-to for success.
5,Best Gardening Book,"Garden Way's Joy of Gardening has helped me with my ever-expanding garden repertoire for 30 years. It's simple, direct and streamlined and contains numerous photos to help anticipate the end results of all my work. Couldn't do without it."
2,Joy of Gardening,"The book was not posted with a photo, so I didn't realize it was vegtable gardening and not flower. The book looked a little faded."
5,If you grow your own vegetables....,"Classic garden reference book and also a lot of tips. How to build raised, wide beds to grow more veggies with less work. A useful book for the serious gardener."
5,Terrific book for growing your home garden,This book of wide rows brings great gardening tips to amateur gardeners like me. I highly recommend Mr Raymond's book and now await my own results.
4,And I Speak Klingon Too.,"Well thank you for that refreshing take on things Jimbo from (where was it again?). ""I have 2 diplomas with highest honours in the computer field. I am A+ and Network+ certified. I have over 10 years of computing experience and I can't pass exam 70-210"". Well if his two Diplomas were at the the same standard as his A+ and Network+ Certifications it's no wonder he struggles with #70-210. Yes there are typos and mistakes but I just wonder how the other reviewers got through their exams if this Exam Cram was so bad. Whilst I agree that no title is perfect being hyper critical for the sake of it or because one is a little ""slow"", no matter how frustrating that might be, is no reason to lay into this title. Overall worth the read and the price."
3,DEATH IN VENICE BY Thomas Mann did not hold my interest.,Not too enthusiastic about DEATH IN VENICE. I love Venice and like to think of it in modern times without dwelling on the dark side.
3,"Like Moby Dick: a must-read, but now a bit of a slog.","Beautifully written, of course, but not for entertainment. Contains a lot of clumpy German rumination. Call me unwashed, but the story really doesn't amount to much either; rather moon-y, as a matter of fact. Times have changed."
1,too dense,I read about twenty pages of this upon the recommendation of a friend and gave up. Life is too short.
3,Not interesting for a non-scholar,"This was a fine translation as far as I could tell. I could only appreciate this story on a literal level and I enjoyed the intelligent storytelling, but was disappointed ultimately. I couldn't relate to what the main character was obessing about. I wish there had been some overt discussion of sex, but I guess that wasn't possible during the time this was written. I know there were literary allusions galore that I missed that might add to the enjoyment of a reader better educated than I."
1,"Could not finish, it was so bad","I don't like writing a review of a book i have not finished. But i just *couldn't* finish Death in Venice, even though i tried twice. I found it to be badly written, and very boring! Perhaps i came to it with too much of a build-up - 'turning point of twentieth century literature' and all that. I found the exploration of the main character's minutest thought overdone, and the narrative seemed to be going nowhere.I didn't even bother with the other stories in the anthology on the basis of what i had alread put myself throughPerhaps i missed something, but this was one of the most boring books i have ever attempted."
1,Disturbing,"A disenchanted middle-aged German scholar stalks a young teenage boy during his retreat to Venice during the plague. This sums up the dense and disturbing plot of ""Death in Venice."" ... it is considered great tragic literature and even added to the ""Cannon"" of Western Literature. I, for one, found the plot disgusting; dense and boring text does not help the struggle to finish the reading. Hemingway, Faulkner, and Conrad, though dense (and at times, dull in their own right), capture the attention and imagination of the reader, creating an adequate encounter."
4,Using the Evil Eye to find happiness,"ChiChi Maggiordino's life begins to improve when her grandmother teaches her how to use the Evil Eye. And in the 50s in Minneapolis, Italian immigrants need all the help they can get, including the benefits of the Evil Eye, bribery, miracles, whatever to overcome obstacles that are tossed their way like pepperoni on top of a cheap pizza.A story of the search for happiness amidst changing times. A good first novel."
4,A new favourite!,"I loved this book (like a tomato). This is a really well written, light and easy read. Although the story has it's tragic moments, I loved the craziness of the characters and the humour throughout. And who could resist the title?Can't wait for part two..."
3,"much truth, too little focus","Although it is in need of significant cutting, re-writing and re-editing, this book contains much wisdom and insight. Written from the perspective of a young Italian girl transplanted in the United States, one need not be an immigrant to connect with ChiChi's struggle to make sense of the confusion of life."
3,Bargin Read,"Like the other reviewers, I picked it up from the local bookstore bargin racks because of the title. My favorite book in the world is 'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn' and this follows the same kind of genre. In the 'About the Author' section it says this is the first of a trilogy about the Maggiordano family. I don't think the others have been written yet, but I'll keep an eye out for them. The last three pages have me curious."
5,A Great Book,"I am flat-out awed by this wonderful book. I love it! I've shared it with others who share my opinion. My boyfriend wouldn't give my copy back to me, my mother read it and ordered copies for her friends. I gave a copy to my boss for his birthday and he (and his wife) loved it. I fell in love with ChiChi and her brother, Marco, and all the characters in the book. Marie Giordano writes with incredible passion and life. I was drawn into every moment. I especially was interested in the dwarves, and ChiChi's relationship to them. Poignant, moving, funny. This book tops my all-time favorite books and I can't wait for the next book in the trilogy. I've never felt so intimately involved with a family on the page before. The voice of ChiChi is hypnotic, mesmerizing."
5,Very Imformative & Interesting,Mr. Bogart does an excellent job in explaining the culture in a neutral stance. He is very knowledgeable in his area and does a great job in making it understandable for students who had no past knowledge of Islam. The video is extremely informative and has an attracting atmosphere that keeps the viewers interested on the topic.
5,Understanding Islam,This is a great video and a must see for all ages. Mr. Bogart is very clear on his speaking and his examples were easy to understand. I learned a lot watching this short video.
5,Excellent Balanced Perspective,With all the misunderstanding that accompanies the subject of Islam these days it is good to get someone with a balanced approached delving into the subject. Ignorance and prejudice are never going to get us into a position to deal with the issues of the culture clash between Muslims and the West. I have read materials that overly demonize Islam and others that are simply extended efforts to whitewash any and issues that do need to be confronted. I believe that this effort from Mike Bogart is a positive step in having an adult conversation on the subject.
5,Understanding Islam by Michael Bogard,This video was very instructive and detailed. I recommended it for everyone who wants to learn about the essence of Islam . This video teaches all you need to know about Islam in just 35 mins. Excellent Job Professor Michael Bogard.
4,Informational,This book is very informative. The authors have not written the book in a technical way but very down to earth which is helpful for those of us who are not technical people.I'm not quite half way through the book and it can get confusing but I've learned a few things that I've never thought about and I'm excited to only learn more.If you're looking for a book that has diagrams on where to place your lights for different scenarios this book isn't for you. If you're looking for a book to understand the way lighting works and how you can arrange your lights for the look you want this book is for you.
5,Great book,"haven't finished the book yet but it's very intresting and full of useful information,some of the stuff that i alresdy knew but didn't how to apply to photography, so it was great to have such a book to put it words, learned alot from it."
5,Most helpful photo book yet...,"Although I've read many books about photography, this one really hit the nail on the head for me. Most other books I've read don't spend nearly enough time on lighting except for a few notes on outdoor back lighting versus front lighting, but this entire book is about it! Of course, the other books I've read didn't have the word ""lighting"" in their title, so this may be a little unfair.Aside from learning about photographing still subjects: metal, glass, black on black, white on white, etc., you will learn about how to light a portrait both indoors and out. The book goes into some details on the physics of light, reflected versus diffuse light, and how to position your lighting equipment to get the desired effect. Highly recommended - there may well be better books on this subject out there, but I haven't run into them yet. I think I've learned more from this book than the other ten or so books I have laying around."
5,This is the best!,"I have about a dozen books on lighting. If I could only have one, this would be it!I plan to use the book as the text for a studio photography workshop that I'm setting up."
5,The best photo book I've ever read,"This is essential handbook for about everything you'll encounter in studio. You'll learn the basics and master the laws of light & surface and how to overcome many difficult situations, written in a language that is quite easy to understand. Every photographer should own (and read) this book, from rookie to pro! Outstanding!"
3,makes sense,the information in this book is valid and easy to understand -- very easy. sometimes i feel like it is a middle school textbook
4,Very useful but a little dated,"I am a professional photographer, and I was looking for a book on lighting technique - which this book supplied excellently.Their step by step approach is easy to follow and understand, and all explainations have images attached so you can see what they are talking about.They slowly build your general knowledge on how light works rather than supplying specific lighting diagrams, allowing (and suggesting that you do) you to adapt the knowledge to your own use. They then go into more detail with difficult lighting subjects such as metal, glass, and more, and how to deal with them.My only complaint is that the book is starting to feel a little old, especially when they talk about colour. It is almost exclusively film based with virtually no reference to digital technology. If they were to do an updated version with more emphasis on lighting for digital, I would provide 5 stars."
5,Cut to the Chase,"I'm going to cut right to the chase. You want to understand lighting, get this book. You want to improve your understating of lighting, get this book. You want to improve your lighting problem solving skills, get this book. Simply put, get this book."
2,For Commercial Photographers,"I found this book to be for commercial photographers. Over 3/4 of the book describes how to photograph glass, metal, ect. If you are working with people there are better lighting books than this. Nothing ground breaking in this one."
4,Good Book...,The book is really good. Especially the cases about different photos of different objects are very usefull. The book includes teoric and pratic knowlage both...
5,Light and photos,This is a great book for photographers who want to know and understand how the light is effected for photos.
4,so much and more,The level of science for photography in this book is more than I can digest in one week. Very informative
3,light,"This book was not the most recent edition. I would have liked to have known this, but it has the same info so it is ok."
5,best supplemental shake ever!!!,"very good flavor, great when used in blender, great breakfast for a busy lifestyle!!! best of all, leaves you feeling full after 4 hours. Definitely recommend this shake specially the strawberry flavor."
5,I know what they did last winter... and I loved it!,"It was easy to see how this movie influenced ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". ""Suspicions"" is a tight little thriller with a great story and a super twist at the end. If you like mysteries, you'll love figuring this one out."
1,Can You Say Band Wagon?,"Boring, Been done a million times before,Im sick of all these bands now a days why don't they try something new. This kind of music is getting so stale that all you can do is break out your old tunes and listen to them instead"
2,eh...,"this album was highly anticipated by all pantera fans .... especially me .... phils gone .... i just figured pantera w/o phil ..... welll this sorta sounds like some random radio metal bs its really dull, whatever parts that are catchy are really lame, the new singer should stick w/ bass. and dimebag ..... dont tell me all your talent went down the drain .... what i remember of vinnie was grarly hardcore doublebass and thick slammin drums .... what happend? ..... this album blows."
1,Damageplan ?,"This cd is a joke ! I listened to it once and threw it in the trash can . I couldn't believe it was dimebag and vinnie paul playing ! To me, it sounded nothing like the two ! I'm not trying to compare it to Pantera at all . A lot of people think Phil's band Superjoint Ritual sucks . I for one do not . I love Superjoint Ritual . They have some heavy stuff on both cd's . At least Phil stayed true to the metal scene . Damageplan is horrible nu-metal . In my opinion the only thing they will damage is their reputation to the true underground metal fans!"
3,Damageplan - New Found Power,"This album really isn't that bad. Everyone says it sucks. The only reason why people don't like it is because it's 2 people from Pantera, and there not as good as pantera. I'm sure everyone would think differently about this album if it was 2 other guys. If your a fan of bands like Hatebreed than you will problably most likely like these guys. I don't really know the album that good, cuz it gets kinda repeative. It's still pretty good all and all I guess.."
2,follows in metallicas footsteps..,when i see people start to defend a cd. THATS when you know something is definately wrong. heard 2 songs too many from this cd. singer flat out stinks. music is so so. disappointing for the talent. if you're looking for pantera here. go to their back catalogue. only redeeming virtue of this cd...the name of the band. thank god they decided not to keep the pantera name. this is nowhere near worthy of being called pantera...r.i.p. pantera.
2,Disappointed with it overall,"As much as I loved Dime's guitar work, Vinnie's kickass drumming and Patrick's work with Halford on his solo releases this cd was a big disappointment.It has about 5 really good songs on it. Pride, Save Me and Cold Blooded really stand out and the rest are pretty much filler. Lot's of growling and little groove to the song structure. Pantera always had a nasty groove to it's music and this is lacking that big time. The music just seems to be missing something and has no direction at all really?It's to bad as Dime was a great player and his brother was equally as awesome behind the drum kit. That moron who shot dime took away not just Dime's playing, but his brothers as well as Vinnie has yet to fully recover from such a tragedy.If you need a Dime fix, check out Rebel Meets Rebel!! It's got that Pantera grind and it's funny as hell. It's a great way to remember a great guy and a great guitar player and was a great parting gift to us his fans!R.I.P Dime!"
2,No. No. No.,"I am a Pantera, Down, and Superjoint Ritual fan, an I'm tellin you all now, this cd sucks. There is no power in the riffs like pantera. There is no vocal power like in Down. And since the separation of pantera, Phil has gone and proven himself to heavy music and the fans. Everyone is so stuck on the idea of members of pantera in a new band that it must be good, just like if the radio plays a song over and over, people flock to it. For all the true troops to heavy music, don't waste the money."
1,Im sorry.,"We all know how great Pantera is, and how Mr. Darrell Abbott is a god, but when you review this album this should all be left behind. This album should be graded by itself, and not as an ode to Dime. And when graded by itself, most of us know what we REALLY think. RIP Dime, but the riffs on here are so downtuned and forgetable, and the whole album is so monotonous.When I picked this up I was so upset because of how awful this is, and the lack of solos on everysong bugs me to death. This Lachman dude is no Phil Anselmo. Not even close. Well, I'ma go listen to Cowboys and try to forget about this, and you all should do the same."
1,Nu Metal Radio Friendly Garbage,"Terrible recycled riffs, uninspired nu metal vocals. NOT HEAVY!!I once regarded Vinnie and Dime as gods but what the hell happened to them, this sounds so watered down and lame. Please skip this one. This even has the Slipknot vocalist on a track called F%#K You (so original isn't it?) This is so commercial to appeal to the mall goth kids. What is metal turning to, No wonder Phil left these guys. Smart man that Phil Anselmo. Listen to Superjoint Ritual those guys know how to shred. They know how to keep metal alive. This album makes me laugh. Check out ""explode"" without a doubt the biggest [...] song ever recorded. Sound like ALice In Chains mixed with Korn. Do yourself a favor please avoid!! [...]. Listen to Superjoint Ritual!! Phil will never sell Out. All hail the epitome of metal... Phil Anselmo!!"
4,Damageplan,"galtengurg, give me a break...what are you talkin about Slipknot for...how about a band that doesnt suck..like Slayer or Black Sabbath. Actually, i have not yet checked the Damageplan cd out...but i will and if it is any better at all than Slipknot...it will be just fine with me."
3,"It's not bad, but it could be better","Listening to all ""metal"" music nowadays (very bad, indeed), I heard Damageplan. Let me be honest, I expected more anger and more solos. This album stands in the middle of what I call ""I want to make true metal"". Compared with any of Pantera cd's this sucks, but I think it's a good effort by the band."
4,Damageplan-New Found Power,"Ok. At first I was disappointed. But it grew on me. I am a little upset because the solos could be so much better. the vocalist is good. But I think he tries to do too much with his voice. An example would be ""SoulBleed."" The lyrics are alright. I just don't view this as a pantera spin off. Just a new band making their debut. And its a good one."
3,What a disappointment....,"I was anxiously awaiting the Damageplan cd to come out. February 10th rolled around, I picked it up, listened to it, and was completely disappointed. The riffs and drum parts aren't all that great. I love Dimebag and Vinnie, they are awesome musicians, but this was so far the biggest disappointment for 2004. There are a few good songs on it but it was nothing amazing. I hope that in the future they make a better second album. I'm still going to give it 3 stars though."
5,Rest in Peace,That's all I can say...Dimebag was truly the influential metal guitarist of this generation. More talent in one finger than any of these new emo/indie rock bands comin' out. The metal community has suffered a great loss. Some f*cking psycho can just grab a gun and do something like this...
3,"Not as good as Pantera ,not as good as Down","Look first off I love Dimebag's Playing , as a guitarist ,he is one of my gods , but to be honest while I didn't expect it to be Pantera ,I have to be honest I was disappointed , The songs I felt were weak , you just didnt get that feeling like u just got stomped as you did with Pantera , or for that matter with Down .While im not crazy about Phil's antics I think he's a better singer than Pat , no disrespect to Pat , hes a great guitar player himself . I wanted this album to kick butt , but sadly it fell short, sorry Dime ,you still rule but this CD don't"
3,"Its not better than Pantera, but what is ?","Many of you complain that this CD isn't as good as pantera, but answer yourself this. Could Pantera themselves even top Cowboys From Hell and Vulgar Display? nope.Dime and Vinnie, although they are possibile of making better music, did a decent job.I mean give the guys a break. Would you want a Pantera-rip off, or a St anger rip off?Atleast the guy can still solo.....cough *kirk hammet* cough..."
3,Good but could have been better.,"I give this album 3 stars (one for each ""good"" song) Being a fan of Pantera I rushed out and bought this album thinking ""Cool, Dimebag and Vinnie are back!!!) But they're definately not back with a bang. This album would have been a lot better if it wasn't for the growly vocals of most the of the songs. Pride and Save Me are great songs not just because they are radio hits but because the guy can actually sing, IMO. Other than that the music is good. Nice and heavy and not too fast (Expect for ""Ef You"" the other song I gave a star to). It a good album, but I hope they take what they did on Pride and Save Me and expand on that. I'd love to here some more heavy stuff with a melodic vocal style instead of trying to emulate Phil Anselmo."
5,The King is dead. Long live the King,"A truly dark day to me, the world has lost one of the finest guitarist in all time due to one of those stupid pseudo humans, call him a beast would be too much. Where this world is going to. Now to be a rock musician is as risky as to be a marine. I won't forget the great songs you created, and the passion you added to your solos. You'll live forever through your music within the heart of all your fans.The King is dead. Long live the King.Artuto Ortiz, fan from Mexico"
2,Nothing Special,"Like Machine Head's ""Supercharger"", this is one CD that I can't get into. It sounds like ""cookie-cutter"", paint-by-the-numbers metal. Nothing special, nothing clever, nothing new. Almost like they were rushing to get something out there quick. Buy this only if you are rich and don't mind wasting money."
4,Powerful enough for me...,"The first single was doubtful, but after talking with the guys, seeing them play live and hearing Pride. I bought the CD and have loved it ever since."
2,I expect way better next time,"I hope this CD is just to get the band well-known by all new-metal lovers out there, because to the true metal fan at heart, this is crap!!! How can the brothers put a record out that sound like that? Either they got cheesy or they didn't hear the final product. The brothers have got to show what they have in their metal heart on the next album or it will be a short ride for that band!!!!!"
4,Damn retards...,"seriously, if you can't hear the amazing guitars on this album, then YOU ARE STUPID! You all must have your fingers in your ears to not be able to hear the great guitars on here, they are on par with ANY Pantera album. I can see it now...""Duh, I hate Damageplan, even though I've never heard a single song from them. Duh, they MUST suck, just because I would suck off Phillip Anselmo at any given chance. Duh, ow my head hurts, brain overload... *sob*..."" Goddamn."
5,kick ass music,"Reviewer: from phillytheres no phil anselmo but it it great music, superb guitar riffs, fast action double bass drums. It is a must for every rock fan to have , such great vocals and he has a great scream. it is an almost PANTERA, but still no, it doesnt come any closer to them. since they broke up and everyone wanted more of them , this is what you get, so get up off your ass and go by it!!"
1,Laughable,"Okay, this isn't metal, nor is it trying to be.That said...it's still pretty horrible. Yeah, a few good riffs here and there, but all in all...I can't keep this in my CD player no matter how many chances I give it."
4,Damage Plan - 'New Found Power' (Elektra),"Review no. 173. Holy sh**! This disc R-O-C-K-S! I know this will sound lame but Damage Plan was supposed to play my town like a week after guitarist Dimebag Darrell's untimely death. Due to the emotional shock that a lot (if not most) of us old school / long time metal fans were in following that tragic day - what many have NOW tagged as the Heavy Metal's 911, I simply could not get myself to take the time to listen to this CD. But after awhile, I found it to be an inspiration to myself as well as a couple of fellow patrons. I mean, Damage Plan is IN fact a branch of Pantera, so THUS it (in my humble opinion) is a darn good 'extreme metal' album. Cuts I thought made this title a keeper are ""Breathing New Life"", the in-your-face ""Pride"", the aggressive ""Reborn"", ""Blunt Force Trauma"" and the disc's acoustic closer ""Soul Breed"". If this title doesn't do something for fans of Machine Head, Soulfly, Rob Zombie and Slayer - then I really don't know my music."
2,I wanted to like it,"As an old fan of Pantera, I desperately wanted to like this album but never could even find one song to really be a favorite. They tried too hard to be current in the newmetal trend thus making for unmemorable bland formula songs. Sad."
3,Do not compare this to Pantera at all please.,"This is a totally different band. There should be no comparison between Damageplan, Pantera, Down, Superjoint Ritual, Necrophagia, Crowbar or any of Pantera's former members' projects.Now that you know that, I'll go on about my review.Everything is good with the exception of the vocals.Get a new one, make a new album, and I might listen to it more than once.But the 'New Found Power' track is pretty good, though.I recommend this to open minded people that know the difference between band names."
4,Good follow up to the Pantera legacy,"Not every song on the album is great, in fact there are only a few really amazing songs (Crawl, Pride, Soul Bleed), the rest are good or just ok. It was good to hear some post-Pantera tunes though, Dimebag does have some incredible hooks and solo riffs. And his guitar tone is much better than the chainsaw distortion of Pantera. It sounds a little richer and more mature."
3,"Well, it doesn't suck...","2.5 stars.The sound of Damageplan is rather different from Pantera so if you are looking for Pantera 2.0, you will be disappointed. It's heavy, yes, but the riff-work just isn't there. The album isn't bad but there wasn't a single song that reached out and grabbed me. I've listened to it several time now and I can't recall a single hook, riff, or solo. Still, it is probably better than the last Pantera album (perhaps, the last two), but that's not saying much as Pantera had clearly jumped the shark by that point.Not terrible but not good.Not recommended."
5,was going to give it 4 stars...but,"was going to give it 4 stars...till i seen these brainless morons reviews...if you like pantera you will like this, that is all yu need to know! I call it Pantera II, but if you want to, listen to these other greenday love'n retards :)"
4,PANTERA is still alive!!! DAMAGEPLAN is just a break?,"comming from a huge PANTERA fan, NFP kicks ass! vinnie and dimebage can do anything, and NFP is the proof. this album is very creative and musical at the same time. i love it!!! but the only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because! it just wasn't as heavy as i hoped it would be? but still kicks ass! as for my title and what i mean is that PANTERA, is not gone but on hiatus! they will rejoin in the not so distant future, and record;'VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER 2'? but in the meantime, DAMAGEPLAN, will do! STRONGER THAN ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Ah, So Close...but No","When I first heard about Damageplan and I knew that Dimebag's in the band, I was ready for something pretty cool...maybe something along the lines of Pantera or a reversal of Phil Anselmo's Superjoint Ritual (a man and band I have alot of respect for).And while alot of Dime's crafty guitar work is apparent in this album, a good solid vocalist is not. The singer is would be decent enough if he didn't sound Like Marilyn Manson during parts of songs.Overall, I rate this album a 3 because It's just not what I hoped for. It's not as bad some will say but certainly not worthy of having Pantera has a reference."
2,an honest review,i wont compare damageplan to pantera why because there a diff band. i went through the album 2 times and to be honest i wasnt impressed. i had high hopes maybe to high but they failed.i think they try to hard to become mainstream and i read that phil said that when he left pantera dime and vinnie wanted pantera to become more mainstream. well it does seem that way with this album. dont get me wrong there a few really good songs but only about 4. it would have made a great EP. but overall d/l a few and decide if you like it or not but for me the answer is no. better luck next time guys.
1,"IMO, Lame","Well I was disappointed. It sounds like Pantera mixed with mainstream/commercial nu-metal. There's maybe about 2 good songs on here, one being the last song. A few cool riffs here and there but overall nothing great. Gets boring fast, imo."
1,The damage is done,"All I can say about this album is that if your expecting it to be heavy DON'T BUY IT!!! It sounds worse than ""Saint Anger""(if that's possible). It sounds like what I would imagine Pantera without balls would sound like. Thats just my opinion."
4,talented.......album,"Iv read all the reviews for this album and id have to say that people are messed up.Ill give it to you straight,if you want an album that sounds just like pantera,this is not the album for you.If you want something that is a change that kinda is the same style or you like the sound of pantera then try this out.As for me i really like the album,because to me thers a lot of talent that i dont think that people are giving them.To go through a huge break up from pantera and still be able to shread on a new album,i give them crdeit for that.This a great album that shows some hard licks with some pretty sick guitars riff solos.If your one of those i got to buy the album because every song has to be fast and super hard core you might want to think twice about buying because not evry song on this album is like that."
3,A LACKING ALBUM BUT DIMEBAG AND VINNIE STILL KICK ASS,"IN ALL HONESTY,I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE THIS SHINING REVIEWS BEING DIMEBAG'S LAST RECORDED EFFORT,BUT UNFORTUNATELY,THE ALBUM DOESN'T RATE WHEN COMPARED TO PANTERA,I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO PANTERA FANS BEFORE SUPERJOINT RITUAL,IT DOES HAVE SOME MOMENTS AND VERY COOL RIFFS BY DIME,BUT PATRICK DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO PHIL AS A VOCALIST,WHEN I FIRST WHACKED THIS IN I EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE,BECAUSE I PERSONALLY THOUGHT DIMBAG AND VINNIE WERE PANTERA,HOWEVER THE CHEMISTRY REALLY ISN'T THERE AS IT WAS IN PANTERA'S ALBUMS AND PATRICK HAS A GOOD ENOUGH VOICE BUT LACKS ANY PRESENCE,HE IS MUCH BETTER UTILISED AS A GUITARIST,ANYWAY IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A PANTERA FAN YOU WILL NEED TO PICK IT UP,YOU PROBABLY WON'T PLAY IT OFTEN THOUGH,IT WILL SELLALOT MORE COPIES THAN IT DESERVES DUE TO THE TRAGEDY,IF YOU WANT TO HERE DIMEBAG'S BEST WORK PICK UP ANY OF PANTERA'S 90'S ALBUMS"
1,Sad,"Terrible. I was excited to hear this new project, given that i am a long time fan of Pantera. It is different than Pantera, which isnt good or bad unlike other reviewers say. I'm always open to new things, but this is straight up no holds barred new metal. lets grab the guitar, keep hitting the low e string over and over again, and hope that a cool sound comes out. As for the vocals, im not even gona comment. Lets just say you might as well listen to Dimmu Borgir. Want some real metal? Listen to Master of Puppets, or Symphony X's Oddysey, or Guns N Roses' Appetite for Destruction. This isnt metal. This is trashy new age garbage."
1,short and sweet,plain and simple:Pantera-KIK ASS!Damageplan-SUCK ASS!Don't buy it if u were looking for the brutal sound of pantera. u will be SOOO dissapointed
4,Lyd Smoked A Lid Before They Recorded This,"This band is fuzz drenched punk psychedelia as it should be. Nothing new and innovative, just amusing lyrics over wonderful, fuzzed out blasts of stoner rock in all it's garage originated glory. This is Nuggets at it's logical conclusion. Recorded in Los Angeles in January of 1970, barely clocking in at 21 minutes, it's not perfect, just a body rush of pure fun. 'Nuff said!"
4,Lyd - self-titled (Akarma),"Recorded in 1970. Until fairly recent, I've never even heard of this obscure Los Angeles psychedelic band. Plus, with this EP - you get only six songs. To bad [someone] wasn't able to scrap together a full-length CD of Lyd's work. Nonetheless, I got a lot out of experiencing ""The Time Of Hate And Struggle"", the total happening ""Stay High / Fly Away Is Still Okay"", the seven-minute ""Think It Twice Over"" and ""Trash Pad"". Personnel: Frank Tag - guitar, piano & vocals, Jack Linerly - guitar & vocals, Rob Weisenberg - bass & vocals and Chet Desmark - drums & vocals. Recommended for fans of Druids Of Stonehenge, The United States Of America ('60's band), Churchills, Invaders and possibly Fifty Foot Hose."
4,Hard n' heavy out of 1970's Los Angeles!!,"Here's a hard to find stoner/psych/rock heavy guitar album out of 1970 Los Angeles. Just three or four copies of this band's acetate were initially produced for demo purposes, but it has been reissued several times since with different cover artwork.Their style is just the right mix of the influences of the time and although it runs a short 21 minutes, it is well worth having if early 70's heavy stoner rock is your thing!!Members:Jack Linerly (guitar, vocals)Frank Tag (guitar, piano, vocals)Rob Weisenberg (bass, vocals)Chet Desmark (drumsTrack Listing:01 - The Time Of Hate And Struggle - 3.0002 - Need You - 2.3603 - Stay High, Fly Away Is Still Ok - 3.5704 - Double Dare - 1.4705 - Think It Over Twice - 7.2306 - Trash Pad - 2.14"
4,Great toy for an energetic puppy!,"We bought this puppet for our Miniature Schnanzer puppy. For a child, the tune is produced by one's hand going up inside the puppet to move the mouth, playing ""Old McDonald Had A Farm."" Our puppy gets the same result by chewing on the tongue area of the cow. The toy is made well enough to withstand rough chewing and dragging around of our puppy. My only complaint is that when the batteries are dead, there is no way to replace them other than taking the puppet apart and sewing it back together. We had bought this same toy before, so we knew its usefulness would be limited for our puppy, who played with it endlessly. For a child, I think this would be a very enjoyable and durable toy."
3,"Great show, but poor version","The three star rating is only for this release of the show because of what it's lacking. The Trailer Park Boys is a great show. A fake documentary comedy similar to Reno 911. Unfortunately this release is done by a different company than all the other dvd seasons, specials, and movies out there. This dvd has absolutely no extras. You will be much better off buying the Season 1 & 2 TPBs which has lots of extras- commentary tracks, deleted scenes, alternate takes, interviews, outtakes and a music video."
5,love tpb!,Trailer Park Boys are awesome! And the cost of this dvd made it even better! I am planning to collect them all!
1,Not XP Compatible,"This book includes a CD with samples to walk you through, but the program is not supported in Windows 2000 or XP. So unless you are using win98 or ME, you can't use this program, which makes the book mediocre at best."
2,Not recommended,"This book covers little ground. The author extends comic relief constantly, which gets extremely annoying. Many books on this subject are much better."
3,Deadly Secrets,"Deadly Secrets is a unique twist on the King Arthur/Camelot mythology. This prequel tells of the early events in the life of Lancelot (known early on only as an orphan named Darian de Paimpont). As the story progresses we see the young Lancelot engage in several episodes that portray his heroic nature and reveal their tragic aftermaths. I believe the strength of the novel is its creation of a character who is capable of performing great deeds of heroic proportion, yet he lacks the maturity or strength of character to abide to a sense of heroic integrity and ethics. Through the course of the novel, the author reveals an early connection between Lancelot, King Arthur, and Merlin. This connection is unique in that it creates a sense of doom for Arthur's Camelot before it even begins. The author does a good job of showing a Lancelot who is deeply flawed, and ultimately incapable of being a true hero."
1,awful,"The sense of humor is juvenile & it has no serious advice. Seriously, if you're not looking for old man humor, spend your money elsewhere."
1,Absolutely the lamest thing...,"I have ever seen. I am embarrassed to have this tripe in the house. This man must be the source of all those terribly unfunny e-mails sent by ""dirty"" uncles everywhere. This book might be funny if you (...)yourself laughing at the Reader's Digest's ""humour"" sections. A large section of it seems to be a regurgitation of the man's previous book: The Dieter's Guide to Weight Loss During Sex. Otherwise it is filled with useless, random, lame jokes and lists. I opened it up, flipped through it, and sighed, because it just seems to be a weighty collection of sex/dating oriented e-mail jokes, the kind you delete because they've already made the rounds three times. I am keeping this review anonymous because I'm so embarrassed to have been rooked by this..."
3,too soon to tell,"I just received my order of 8 of these. The bulbs I received do not show the ""BR 38"" anywhere on the packages. I hope they are what the page here says they are. When I try them, I will see how they do -- and perhaps report back."
4,70's Jazz Lives Again,The title says it all. Instrumental playing is clean and together and the rhythm is right on.
3,"Alternate title: Crazy Frog ""sings"" back-up","I like Crazy Frog, he's CCRRRRAAAAZZZYYY! But this album is a bunch of remixes with the frog's noises as back-up to human vocalists. Even more so than the first album. But taking that into consideration, it's still a fun time. Just not as good as the past experience."
1,"Dreadfull Irritating crazy frog album, part 2...","This is the next part of the horrible unbearable Crazy Frog waves the Music industry has dished out...And again, ind just horrifying what this album ist, a mega irritiating coverversion of Queen's We Are The Champions, and quite a few other covers of other artists, in mega annoying Crazy frog style...Please stay away from this!"
3,Very Convenient and Organized,"Our administrative assistant ordered this for me, when I moved into a desk that didn't have a top drawer. I have moved desks a few times since then and I haven't given it up yet - nor do I plan to. It is great! I slides over almost any drawer in your desk, organizes all of your office supplies, and puts it at your fingertips.There are slots forPost-it Flags with free Durable Tabs (680-RYBGVA),3M Post-it Flags in Pop-up Dispenser, Five Bright Colors 375 Count (688-AST2),3M Post-it 3 x 3 Inch Notes, Five Colors, 100 Sheets 14 Pack (654-14AU), MMM6555PK Post-it Notes, 3""x5"", 5/PK, 100 Sh/Pad, Neon Fusion (MMM6555PK) Qty-2, and tape. Along with many dividers - All of my office supplies fit and are organized.The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because during the first 2 weeks I had it - one of the tabs broke off the lid that covers the tape area.Recommended ~~ but be careful with the lid or you will break it."
1,ordinary subset of normal dictionary,on an entertainment scale I rate this as a highly under performing attempt at being amusing. This regurgitation of the dictionary is absolutely not worth the few bucks.
3,"1 part informative, 1 part bs","This book contains a lot of funny, simple truths. I got it to get a 'professional' opinion on my office romance and found some pretty funny definitions concerning that, but in the end the best place for this book is in the bathroom :)"
2,"Accurate, but what's the point?",For me it missed the mark. Wasn't that funny or entertaining. Moving on to more productive or entertaining offerings.
5,It's Funny Because It's True,"If you work in an office, you'll both laugh and cry when reading this book. It could be filed under ""humor"" if only it weren't such an accurate representation of corporate BS terminology. This is an important anthropological work!"
3,good,"good source of illustration for any speaker that wanted to further illustrate his message. buy it, its good for you"
5,Enter Sailor Venus!,"At last Sailor Venus makes the scene. I own this volume of Sailor Moon and it is one of my favs!!! It shows who is the Moon Princess at last. I have been a Moon fan since I was 8, but the show somehow got cancled. I had forgotten about it for awhile until I saw this movie for sale. I bought the movie and was hooked once again on Sailor Moon. This movie is great if you have never seen what Princess Serenity looks like. This is the best volume of the first Sailor Moon season that I own so far. I recomend this to all people who love Sailor Venus and Princess Serenity. The song ""My Only Love"" plays through the transformation of Princess Serenity. I almost forgot. DARIEN IS DEAD!!!! Or is he. The scouts may soon learn that the Darien they once new may never come back."
4,sailor moon and tuxedo mask discover true identities,"well in the first episode of this tape sailor venus appears and saves the day while Darien was wounded and in the next episode Darien and Serena discover each others true identites and the moon princess is revealed, and darien is taken by the negaverse, and the last episode is serenas first battle against darien who now works for the negaverse. this is a great tape a must buy for all sailor moon fans."
3,"Satisfactory, not fancy",Functional watch with no date/day. Setting knob is quite small for old fingers. Good value for the price if you just want to know what time it is.
3,Good watch,It's a good watch but I think the band could be bigger to fit the wrist better . If it's for a man..It's was shipped fast.Just wish the wrist band was bigger.
2,non watwerproof watch,"it is not waterproof, it has water inside now.so i can't wear it in the swimming pool so it's useless to me"
3,When will this thing grow?,I've had this orchid now for almost a year and it's still the same size. Like 2 inches! It's still very green but no stalk for buds. I may order another and see what the new one does. Maybe I shouldn't have repoted it right when I got it? Well hopefully soon it will produce something. I'm looking forward to the look and the scent!
5,Best Quality Glue Stick Money Can Buy,"3M is a quality name and their glue sticks live up to their reputation. These sticks are for corrugated box sealing and they do the job nicely. The glue is thick and flows easily, but is not watery, as some other brands of hot melt glue sticks will make a terrible mess and risk burning the skin from being too hot and too liquid and squirting when sealing cartons. Consistency is a thick gel and is just right. The glue stick won't drip out of the gun's nozzle (3M's Polygun AE II hot melt gun is what we use) and it solidifies quickly and bonds with a solid weld. Your packages will not fail in transit. What is glued, stays glued. I recommend this 3M product. [...]"
4,works great,"by the way, this is for 1 pound (15 sticks) of glue. works great. just stinks that shipping cost more than the glue."
2,3M hot glue,This glue dries (hardens) too quickly for intricate woodworking projects. Good for closing boxes or easy to work with items.
2,Hard to read,The beginning was so confusing I couldn't keep who was talking straight. The change of view should have been more obvious. Of course the ending was unexpected but not a total surprise. The descriptions were very good of the fighting and the landscape. I was dissapointed.
3,Not Too Bad,"This movie isn't as bad as you might think. Lon Chaney Jr plays a bank robber who is turned in by his supposed friends and dies in the gas chamber. He is brought back to life by an experiment gone awry by a ""mad"" scientist who is looking for a cure for cancer. After killing the doctor and his assistant Chaney goes after the people who double crossed him. Shades of Frankenstein and the return of the zombie."
4,The Indestructable Man,"This might not be one of Lon Chaney's most well known performances but it is a good one. As a note of interest to all classic TV fans, Joe Flynn (who played Captain Binghampton on McHale's Navy) has a small but interesting role in this movie as well. Chaney plays a large portion of the movie mute and still gives a chilling performance."
3,Short of Perfect,"The CD is titled Catholic Christms Classics with soul inspiring pieces such as ""Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming"", ""Puer natus in Bethlehem"", ""Bring a Torch, Jeanette, Isabella"", ""Gabriel's Message"", ""The Virgin's Slumber Song"", and the most moving rendition of ""Night of Silence/Silent Night"" that I have ever heard.However, the addition of ""Go Tell it on the Mountain"" was far from appropriate for a CD entitled ""Catholic Christmas Classics"". First of all the tune is not a Classic. Second, it is not Catholic. The hand clappin' little ditty is so far out of place among these great works that you will find yourself skipping it over and over again. The awe and wonder of the Savior's Birth is captured in the other pieces and creates an Almost Perfect Catholic Christmas CD."
5,Pristine,Received this as a Christmas gift in 2010. I must give this one 5 stars out of 5. The choir harmonizes beautifully. Excellent arrangements. The recording quality is superb. I have listened to a few too many choral CD's where the production quality has been neglected so I was quite pleased with this effort. No skimping on quantity either either (72 minutes). Soothing for the soul during the hectic holiday season. I highly recommend this CD.
1,If you are in a desert island and this the only book you have to read; go fishing,"This book is formulaic to put it politely. Another international intrigue plot, another ""James Bond like"" hero, one dimensional; rich and irresistible to every woman within ten miles from him. Hardy Boys like cliffhangers; and of course the most stupid and retarded set of bad guys in the history of literature!The writing style wants to be groovy and cool and comes out flat annoying.And by the way; people in Brazil speak Portuguese, not Spanish! (just a little detail for you there Mr. Bell)Unreadable"
1,Very poor indeed,"How depressing. I've tried one or two of Mr Bell's books and I always hope they will get better, sadly they don't. Firstly I think the audience is not clear, in my view this are books for young adults who have a less sophisticated requirement and adults will find this far too simplistic and not get hang up by too many ""huh?"" points.If you are grown up and want a plot driven thriller with pace and characterisation - this is not the book to pick up.Nick"
1,What a dumb book!,"Really dumb, filled with cliches and 1-dimensional characters. The author expects us to believe a sheriff deputizes young men (apparently teens) and sends them out as a posse on horseback? The protagonists are all gigantic specimens with extensive espionage backgrounds who do really stupid things. A waste of time if you expect any realism or intelligence in a book; an earlier review called it a pulp novel and that's pretty accurate."
4,Ted Bells: SPY,I liked the book. Did not think it was as good as previous books but I like the Character Tony Hawks as well Clancy's Jack.I recommend this book.
4,A Very Good Story With A Message,"'Spy' combines numerous events from today's headlines into a fast paced thriller.It features an alliance between drug cartels, radical Islamic terrorists, and Latin American 'reconquistas' all intent on destroying America. Although some of the technology featured in the book seems rather implausible, novelists often take creative license to craft a good story. Mr. Bell has done that very well in this story.Although a novel, it should give some pause to the open borders extremists. The author shows how a nation without borders ceases to be a nation. As the protagonist, Alex Hawke, says: 'I still find it absolutely terrifying, Conch, that somehow, in parts of America, borders have become politically incorrect.' He goes on to say, 'Without borders, we've got nothing.''Spy' is the first Ted Bell novel that I have read. It won't be the last."
4,Super fun summer read!,"Now this is a fun book! It's 700 pages so it's not the quickest summer read, but a great thriller revolving around terrorist threatening the US from the jungles of the Amazon. Fun characters and past pace, could be a heck of a movie."
5,Spy: A Thriller,"This was just as good as Ted Bell's other three books. We bought this one on CD in the unabridged form, and it was about 16 hours long. We took it on a 1500 mile drive and the miles and hours just flew by. It was hard to even stop for gas! If you liked Hawke, Pirate and Assassin, you will love Spy: A Thriller. If you haven't read the others, read them first--I had to explain to my spouse some of the relationships, etc as he hadn't read the first three books."
3,Spy - good premise,A little too fantastic. No doubt it is occurring as we speak. Maybe the apocolypse will happen and those that have prepared will laugh a short while.
1,James Bond meets Batman,"Ted Bell takes an facinating premise; Islamic terrorists using South America and Mexico to wage war against the united states; and ruins it with a cast of characters and plot twists that seem like they were drawn by teenage boys.Our hero is an impossibly rich British lord who is in the spy business and spends his fortune on toys like a 240 ft. super yacht outfitted with state-of-the-art weapons systems, and staffed with private army of mercenaries on retainer.Add to the mix some of the hokiest dialogue I've seen in years and you have a book that is virtually un-readable. I would have liked to see how the book ended, but it ended up in the trash only half-read.What Mr. Bell needs is a good editor... or to move Hawke to the pages of a comic book."
2,Far Fetched,"I couldn't get more than twenty pages into this book. If you really want to read a great novel about what's REALLY going on along the US/Mexican border, check out VENGEANCE IS MINE and INVASION USA by William W. Johnstone."
2,NOT FOR CHILDREN OR TEENS!,"We want to warn parents about this book! Not the same genre as ""Nick of Time"". We have a Kindle and love it! Bought Spy thinking it was safe read for a teenager! Wrong! Will read reviews and do a lot of research on ebooks from now on! Wanted to delete it, so we read forums on how to delete books on Kindle. Very discouraging at first. Everyone said can't get rid of unwanted books,etc.,NOT TRUE! Called 866-321-8851 spoke with supervisor and we now know how to get them off our Kindle and our Amazon account! You have 7 days to change your mind on any purchase to get your money back! In our case, money was not a factor, just wanted it gone. It was soley the content of the book not the Author's ability to write good smut!"
2,Racist fiction,"On page after page of this book, Western Imperialism shines through. It's over, Mr. Bell. The Empire is no more! I could not bring myself to finish this book. I was that offended by the apparent xenophobia and the preposterous plot."
3,Too long,"Enjoyed the story. Very innovative and entertaining, but much too long. Bell could have halved the content of this book and not done any damage whatsoever to the great story line. Overdescriptiveness seems to be a common shortcoming that most writers apparently cannot resist."
2,Dreadful!,"You have heard of story lines that were considered implausable? This one goes way beyond that.I have read some of the earlier Hawke books and liked them, but this one just asked more of me to being willing to suspend rational beliefs than I was willing to do. It is also, frankly, poorly written in many aspects.A mad man has devised a scheme to take over much of the world, assassinate the president on Innaguration Day and attack the US in a way that makes 9/11 just so much child's play.Standing between the accomplishment of the plan and it's defeat is Alex Hawke and some of his minions, a County Sherrif from Texas and one of his deputies and a former Scotland Yard Inspector.Trust me. This one is a clunker!"
4,Does what it says it does.,"This tubing does what it is supposed, or it would if I needed it. I bought 3/4 and 5/8 to make sure I had the right size and needed the 5/8."
4,Great Reference,"This is a great reference guide for students studying law or for those who work in it. Simple definitions make it good even for those with no legal training. This is a great and handy guide for a good price.I own two copies, one I keep at work and the other as a home or travel reference."
3,Not #2.5,"I love ""real"" pencils. They're not the most ""sustainable"" choice, but there's something satisfying about them--writing, rolling them between the fingers, sharpening them.The old Berol Mirado #2.5 were great, but Papermate evidently bought the name and changed the formula. Unfortunately, these are not the #2.5 Berol Mirado of old. They're really #2. Too soft for me."
3,A little disappointing....,"I found these pencils to be firmer than standard #2 pencils, but not as firm as I remember 2.5's being. Next time I might try some drafting pencils since they apparently come in #3."
2,Obstacles to learning science,"This book is organized well, but communicates its subjects poorly. It communicates so poorly, in fact, that it seems almost intended to throw obstacles in the way of learning.It is poorly written and includes (often) unhelpful illustrations. The text seems designed to obscure information rather than imparting information. It forces the reader to work too hard when searching for key information. Where tables would be helpful in comparing and contrasting key attributes of related phenomena, it includes few. Paragraphs often hide key points at the bottom, rather than using topic sentences and paragraph structures that help the reader.One would think the text was written in a foreign language and then translated into English. It seems like the ""educators"" who wrote this may be ""experts"" on education but novices at communication. The editorial staff must be asleep at the wheel, or more focused on style than substance.Truly awful."
1,Mistakes and Mistakes everywhere,I wonder how Microsoft approved this book. This book consists of Errors everywhere. There are number of errors in text too not to mention about errors in practise Tests. In short this book is a compilation of errors.
4,Great guide to help you review and pass the exam!,"There are some errors in the answers to the questions, but it really keeps you sharp and on your toes. The text really helps you review each section needed to pass the exam, then quizzes you on the section. Use as a supplement to review and prepare for the exam or as an additional reference for learning SQL."
3,Quick reference IS OK but should not rely on the test answer,This is a nice book for quick reference for the people those who are wishing to write the MCSE test on SQL Server but the answers for the test questions at the end of each chapter are not correct some cases. So you might have doubt if you are really thorough in the chapter. So do some extra effort to find the right answers for the preparation questions. I guess the book should have been well reviewed before it went to the publisher for publishing.
2,"Plenty of Good Examples, but Some Are Wrong!","Luckily, I'm an experienced SQL Server DBA and Developer. I'm only four chapters into the book, and already found plenty of errors in the answer section after each practice exercise. If you are new to this arena, then stay away from this book. The publisher should spent more time on QA of the content before its release. I'll never buy another ""TestPrep"" from New Riders again."
3,"Nice book, if you can tell whats wrong in the examples",The book is well-structured and full of information. The only thing that's annoying is that the example answers to the questions are sometimes completely wrong. It gives an uncertainty about the quality of the other material in the book.
2,Very dry history,"I was very excited when i bought this book since i am from the Caribbean.However i was disappointed with it. The authors way of telling the story is very dry and sometimes hard to follow.On several parts of the book i found myself trying to read fast so i can get to the real interesting parts. I believe that the author relies too much on the economics of the region while avoiding telling us important events and information on the region.For example he never tells us why the islands were named with the names that they have today.Why Cuba? Where doest it come from? Why Antigua? Why Martinique? Sometimes this book reads like an economics report which makes it very dull and boring at times.I guess the author assumes you know most of the story.Again, very dull and dry history on a region that is full of history and action."
2,Unorganized and biased,"As a reader of regional histories across the globe, I was extremely disappointed with this book from both a historical and literary perspective. This is a highly euro-centric history, with questionable statements about slavery, very little on Caribbean identity, and a war-to-war chronicle. The information is so badly organized that it looks like the editors didn't know what to do - so they put in headings every few paragraphs to ""aid"" the reader. Very disappointing altogether because the history is such an important and complex one to tell."
4,Interesting and very detailed,This is an interesting and thorough history of the Caribbean Islands with maps and obscure historical details.
4,A Brief History of the Caribbean: From the Arawak and the Carib to the Present,Well written account of Caribbean history covering the basics and not being to exhaustive for the average reader. Historical subjects are covered with sensitivity to the current state of the Caribbean self identity.
1,Very Disappointing,"I was looking for a book that really explained and helped a person develop healing techniques. Unfortunately, just like the author's other books, all this one did was talk a lot about what healing is...and even that was never clearly explained! There were no real techniques like you'd expect, only visualizations. If you're looking to learn healing, I'd go online and google Reiki--or check Amazon for some inexpensive e-books. You'll get useful information at a much better price."
1,Healing To Go To Sleep By,This CD is nothing more than the author reading her Healing book. I suppose having mind-controlled cult drones publishing her work that true publishers found unreadable is not enough ego stroking for the author--she's branched out into forcing those silly and sad enough to believe her meglomaniac claims to listen to her oh so boring voice.
1,Healing: Key to Falling Asleep from This Monotone Voice,"Forget Ambien, Seconal, or Halcyon. If you're having trouble with insomnia, try this audio recording. Listen to the author drone on and on about ""healing"" while never even defining what exactly it is. Lull yourself with hypnopompic visions of escaping from this monotone voice or imagine what you could have done with the money you wasted on this recording.Nothing useful here at all, unless you count fueling a meglomaniacal cult leader's delusions of grandeur with your dollars as a useful endeavor.If you're really into metaphysics, stick with the classics such as ""Cosmic Consciousness"" by Bucke, anything by Yogananda, Shakespeare, or Whitman."
5,A must for any Tolkien fan.,"This book is essential for any Tolkien fan who is unfamiliar with Tolkien's medieval sources, or who would like a well-selected collection of the most important influences on Tolkien's fiction. The selections here are very readable and will increase any fan's appreciation of Tolkien's work."
2,Looks Good Enough to Eat - But the Dogs Didn't Care for Them,"These bagels look good enough to eat, but I can't get my dogs to eat them. One absolutely refuses and the other breaks them into little pieces and leaves them."
5,Best Stainless Steel set for the price,"I've been using this set for about 4 months. For two months I looked at different stainless steel cook sets (Costco brand, the Cuisinart MultiClad 12 pc and others) in the $200 range, and settled on the Chef's Classic at $160.The value for the money is excellent. The set is pretty, sturdy and well constructed. The handles stay cool and the pans heat up evenly. As my mother would say: ""every pot has a lid"". The steamer is ingeniously designed to fit every pot.Yes, the stainless steel pan and pot bottoms do discolor (doesn't everything?). But that's not a big concern for me, as I use my set every day, and am more concerned about how they perform.I'm expecting this set to outlive the much cheaper, 20 year old set it replaced.I also got a 5.5 qt Multipurpose pot with Glass cover and a Santoku knife as a bonus mail-in gift which sweetened the deal."
1,unsatisfactory,"I returned my one and one-half quart pan which was pitted and was advised that it would be replaced under warranty. When my replacement arrived, I then sent in my two quart and three quart pans which were also pitted. All this pitting occurred only after five months of use. My replacement one and one-half quart pan started pitting after only being used three times. I called customer service and was advised that I could return the replacement, at my expense once again, and received another replacement. I told them that this would not solve anything since this was an obvious problem in them being manufactured in China. I wanted to return the whole set and receive a full refund as I had spent $56.54 on postage so far and the problem continues. They REFUSED to even consider paying the postage on the replaced one and a half guart pans second return. I have lost all confidence in their product brand after over 30 years of owning their products."
1,"Cheap, Bad Choice.","The looks are fine but this is a low quality product. They are thin and superheat, if you follow the cooking instructions that say that you should cook most of the time on low or medium, its because the thin layers superheat and burn food. If you cook on medium, its hard to achieve the nice golden brown searing. If you buy this set, you are not buying quality; there are really 2 levels, cheap/low quality and high quality/relative expensive, so choose well."
4,Very Nice,"Very nice set of cookware. It will work great for what cooking we do...It is not as ""heavy duty"" as the Biltmore or Emeril brand from Belk's. The bottom is not as thick. In my opinion the cuisinart brand should not be considered ""professional cookware"" because the the thickness and ""heavy duty"" feel is just not present as it is in the above mentioned brands from Belk."
3,maybe not worth all of the pieces,"I've had this set for about a year & I mainly use everything except for the largest pot & the steamer basket. The large pot takes a good 20 minutes to boil water & the steamer basket sits so high, that you really have to fill the large pot almost all the way if you want to cook pasta & use the steamer/strainer. Kind of a waste of time & water. I just wound up getting a chef basket which is a lot more efficient. Otherwise everything still cooks great a year later, even though there is inevitable staining somewhat on the bottom of the cookware."
2,Not Happy,"This product was not what I hoped for. The quality was very poor. I had to send it back. After one use the pot was chipping. Not sure if I just got a defective set or this is what everyone can expect. Nevertheless, I was not happy. It was the poorest quality pot I have every purchased."
2,Discoloration,"I just received my cookware set this afternoon (1-18-11). I took it out and they are very, very nice to look at. I was impressed with the stainless finish. I used two cookware that evening; pan (3 qt) and pot (4 qt). When I went to wash them. I saw the discoloration inside of the pan and was very disappointed. I called Amazaon and informed them of the discoloration that night. Amazaon is happy to take the cookware back."
5,Much better than expected,"For a logn time I looked at different cookware at the local stores and was less then impressed. I read numerous glowing reviews on Amazon with a grain of salt. I finally tkok the plunge and ordered. Wow, this set is high quality. My wife balked at the idea of stainless steel but this set is wonderful. No rust and food doesn't stick much at all. We have an electric cooktop and that may make the difference. The other thing is that with our previous aluminum/Teflon set the cooktop would have to be turned up to 7 to have the water boil. With this set it boils at 3."
4,Good Product,"Beautiful product, not as heavy weight as I expected. Short term this cookware has exceeded expectations, long term is yet to be seen."
2,frying pan came apart,Bottom of the frying pan separated from the rest of the pan. Guess you get what you pay for.
4,Beautiful Cookware,"This set is a great deal! It is very sturdy and high quality. The only negative thing I have found is that the tops are not glass, which I usually favor, but the stainless tops are probably better for cooking. The handles stay cool even though they are also steel. I was using some cheap pans that I had to screw the handles onto myslef, what a step up! I def recommend these!"
2,Good but poor service from Cuisinart,"This is a good set for the price. But expect it to discolor almost immediately after a few uses. If you have an electric cooktop, it could overheat and melt the copper and the bottom will separate. Construction and design is not for people who cook all the time."
2,Stock pot splitting down the side,"Notice my stock pot started splitting down the side the other day, presumably on the seam where they welded it together since it's a perfectly straight line. Wrote Cuisinart customer service since these supposedly have a lifetime warranty and they want me to send the pot back at my own expense and give them a check to cover their shipping back to me as if one way isn't bad enough. Then they'll decide if I ""abused"" it with high heat or otherwise (I haven't). From searching around on the internet, it sounds like best case I'd get it back in around 2 months anyway and it's fairly likely they'll just claim I abused it and not replace the pot, so I'll probably find some food safe solder or braze and attempt to repair it myself.Probably best to save for a better set. Better to buy expensive and only buy once for something like this."
2,Waste Of Money,I used it 2x two different pans an both times the bottom inside got stained nasty an i can not remove it. terrible i wrote to the company an everything. i would not recommend this to anyone an i am very very disappointed that i wasted my money!!!!
5,A great beep-dig detector!!,"Don't let it's looks fool you, this is a great machine. No bells and whistles here just simple and outstanding electronics.Pros:-Lifetime warranty and first class customer service from Tesoro-Light weight ( just over 2 pounds)-Manual ground balance to suit every soil type-Changeable coils available-Deep hitting machine (get a good shovel)Cons:-I can't treasure hunt 24 hours a dayThere is a learning curve but the more you use the unit the more understand it's language and the more good targets you'll dig."
5,Life after Divorce,"As always, Bill has tackled a sensitive and needed discussion in a way that is not only clear, but humorous, but not so humerous that he detracts from the seriousness of the subject."
3,entertaining little book,"Reprint of 1701 volume instructing young persons how to behave. Under such sub headings as 'behaviour at the table' a series of numbered points addresses the child on how he should comport himself. I LOVED ' if Thy Superior relate a Story, say not 'I have heard it before', but attend as if it were to Thee altogether new...if he tell it not right, snigger not nor endeavour to help out.' Accompanied by little b/w line drawings"
2,Good for Starters,I was looking for more information but this is a good beginning for finding out how children of the 1800's were to behave. Good manners is for everyone not just for children.
1,They Need to Think Inside the Box,"As a couple of other reviewers have noted, the boxes that these reconditioned planers are shipped in are inadequate. Mine had been dropped and the holes in the box taped, apparently by the carrier. The planer was obviously damaged and couldn't be raised or lowered. I've asked for a replacement, but I'm not confident that it will arrive in working condition if the shipping boxes aren't improvved."
3,Very Uneasy About This Purchase,"I have ordered several items from Tool Crib and have been very satisfied. However, purchasing the DW735R has not been a positive experience. My primary complaint is about the box and packing. This device was not well packed, and when I received it, some of the plastic components were broken or damaged. I have not yet used this device, but am concerned about unseen damage and accuracy of operation. The free shipping option was slower than expected as I placed the order on June 11 but received it on July 5. The shipping folks were pleasant and it doesn't appear the box was unusually mistreated. I called DeWalt and the person I talked to was not empathetic. I have been a loyal DeWalt customer and have purchased quite a few DeWalt tools (most of them purchased new). I did not appreciate the attitued displayed by this service rep. Everything may turn out just fine but I'm not sure it is worth the trouble."
2,So-So,"It arrived in inadequate packing and was damaged for that reason. I reported the damage on a provisional basis but your staff immediately sent a replacement which has now arrived, also in inadequate packing considering the size/weight of the product. I will return the original in a few days if the replacement is better."
5,A very robust machine,"Am very impressed with my planer. If this beast is portable, I'm glad I didn't order a floor model. It's heavy! However, with its heft is the feeling that it is quite heavy duty. It planes a mirror finish with minimal snipe. I built my own table with 3 foot extensions on both ends that fold up and away and snipe is non existent. I'm most happy with this machine. The only negative is the tape gauge that interferred with the mark and peeled some of the gage tape away."
1,Dewalt has no pride,The package had no padding whatsoever pieces were everywhereDewalt said that I should have told the UPS driver Who Just threw the package out of the truck while still in motion.People like Dewalt and Ups should be banned from Nascar
1,"Poor shipping, arrived broken",Equipment arrived broken. The base was shattered from poor packing. Talked to Customer Service and a second unit was to be shipped.
1,Was John F. Kerry an actual US President????,"Do NOT buy this book unless you want your children seriously misinformed. The 2005 edition of this book actually lists John Kerry after George W. Bush as the 44th president in its table of contents!!! Whatever you may have wanted for the 2004 presidential electioin, it is irresponsible to publish a table of contents insinuating that John F. Kerry is our 44th president. Shame on the editors for letting this one ""slip""...."
3,Review of Encyclopedia of Presidents,This book is written primarily at the level of a junior high student. It has a great deal of information about each President as well as some fun facts about newsworthy topics during their terms. History is a record of facts regarding the President and First Lady. The author left out a focus on several significant first ladies: Jacqueline Kennedy and Ladybird Johnson. Additionally he stated the major interior restoration was begun by Mamie Eisenhower. This was incorrect. She accepted gifts of furniture as did many First Ladies but she did not lead the initiative. This was begun by Jacqueline Kennedy who helped found the White House Historical Association.
1,A warning of the liberal bias would have been nice.,"I purchased this ENCYCLOPEDIA for my 11-year-old son, expecting an objective review of each of the President's terms of Office. Obviously, I was sorely disappointed. Although none of us would agree with every decision made by any President, as loyal Americans, we can and should certainly respect the Office and each man who has served in it. David Rubel's book will be filed in my trash can as soon as I finish typing this, and I will be sure to warn all of my acquaintances against purcahasing anything with his name on it. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!! (I laugh heartily when I see the entry in the Table of Contents for the next President--John F. Kerry!)"
1,"Shocked at Bias and Inappropriate, incorrect info","I bought this at our school book fair and was actually shocked at the inaccuracies and bias. I won't detail all the mistakes(pointed out by other reviewers) but I thought adding the children of Sally Hemings as Jefferson's children on the front page was wildly inappropriate for a book being sold to 7 year olds. One: the claim is still very controversial, a number of scholarly books have questioned the evidence, and most scientists admit the DNA evidence didn't prove anything. Second:none of the other alleged liaisons of any other presidents are mentioned (JFK is noted as the ""first Boy Scout President"", for example). Third, is this really an appropriate topic for elementary school kids? Really, this ""information"" needs to be removed from later editions unless all presidents are going to be treated the same. It's too bad the author allowed his bias to infect the text--but what about the editors at Scholastic?"
2,"Godzilla, wanna be????","I had such fond memories of the movies of the fifties however this one is not of that genre. It still does mimic the ""special effects"" complete with monster with appendages remarkly ""human-like"" in length. I was quite disappointed with the movie but still if you love the simplicity of ""old school"" movie madness ... then this is what the doctor ordered."
4,Fun Monster Flick,"I remember this film showing on TV in NY, well, it seemed like every Saturday when I was a kid. It came with one of the funniest typical TV Guide blurbs I remember from those days, something like: ""Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to bring that prehistoric monster back to London. Now its mother is coming looking for it."" And that was it. And that IS it. That's the plot. Ambitious get-rich-quick guys find monster, bring it back to London over the objections of local boy who is wiser than all the adults in the picture, put it on display a la King Kong or Mighty Joe Young, and find something two or three times larger marching up the Thames Estuary soon after looking for its offspring. Plenty of mayhem ensues, of course. This is not quite up there with the classic Japanese monster films, but it will entertain you. The extras on the DVD are good too."
3,"Film is great, DVD is not so great...","It is unfortunate that this very well-crafted British sci-fi/monster film has had such a lackluster transfer to DVD. The film was originally shot in Technicolor, but you'd never know it from the poor quality print on display here. The colors are somewhat washed out, and the shadow detail is all but non-existent. There are many nightime scenes in the film where practically everything is just...black. Or nearly. This near-classic film (with its many nicely-realized slow-motion shots of the mother and baby creatures tromping through London at night) deserves better treatment.The special effects are certainly several notches above the Japanese Godzilla films of the era, and hold up nicely even today, thanks to attention to detail in every category....monster design, cinematography, etc. And of course, the film is played dead-seriously, which adds to its appeal.Too bad the print itself is not up to par."
4,Gorgo is great..but at London's expense!!,This is a great version of a huge monster gone upset because its offspring has been messed with by unsuspecting humans. At the expense of some big time London landmarks big mama lizard comes into the city looking for it's abducted youth who's being held captive in a watery pit as a circus attraction. The film transfer of this oldie but goodie has stood the test of conversion for dvd. The movie looks great and so do the red eyed beasts. This is a must for any monster film buff's collection! Have fun with Gorgo!!
4,A Giant Monster Favorite,"I always had a yen to see this film ever since the title monster appeared on the cover of an early issue of ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"" magazine. I finally caught up with it much later in life and found it to be great fun. While I always prefered the stop-motion effects work in films like THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (also directed by GORGO's Eugene Lourie) I was never completely put out by a well done man-in-suit effect as we have here. The film plays out as a grand fable and clearly has a little bit of ""dream logic"" to it. The ""Destruction Edition"" DVD is a fine rendering of the film with strong color and decent clarity (I doubt if the film will ever look razor-sharp on disc). The extras are meager but palatable."
3,disappointing,this was a disappointing copy of the movie. with the images faded copies of copies that never seemed in focus and not crisp prints. also despite saying widescreen on the cover this was not a widescreen copy. that being said at least it was a copy of GORGO and will have to do a better print comes out
4,Give Me Back My Son!,"Ogra is not a happy monster and who can really blame her.Her son, Gorgo, was recently captured from their deep sea home and is now a freak-show attraction for a circus in London. And Ogra will stop at nothing to get her son back.The 1961 British Sci-Fi is directed by Eugene Lourie and features the special effects of 2-time Academy Award winner Tom Howard. The monsters are a combination of Godzilla and King Kong, but there is an interesting environmental message in the screenplay by Robert L. Richards and Daniel James.The military has unbelievable firepower, but the action builds up to the good guys finally winning one, though it takes the destruction of London to make the point. This is not the typical monster flick, but Ogra is not a typical heroine, either."
4,One Of Benjamin's Favorites,"One of his favorites, but it gets four stars because it isn't one of mine. This is the film noir of the 50's golden age tide. No one in this film, except Gorgo, is very likable. Everyone is after a buck and doesn't seem to be too concerned who gets in their way while getting it. I guess what Benjamin likes is that the Mommy/Daddy monster comes and saves Gorgo and I have to say that does alot to redeem the film. This is one I rather he didn't want to watch so often."
2,It's like Godzilla without the fun,"It's not so much that the Gorgo movie doesn't have enough monster in it. There's plenty of monster. But there's plenty of military stock footage too. That hurts.Whether you choose to watch this entire snoozefest or fast-forward to the Picadilly Circus destruction scene, you won't find much to satisfy you. There's not even any dubbing to laugh at between the various monster scenes.Mystery Science Theater 3000 pointed out that there are NO women in Gorgo. An entire movie without women = Booooooooooring. Watch Godzilla or Gamera instead, and leave this disappointment behind."
3,Trying to copy Godzilla,"Gorgo was a cool creature. Not as great as Godzilla. Just because the effects were better, the storyline was like!!!!!!!!! King Kong in a way.... The special effects also looked [poor], if you look at some scenes, when a guy is near Gorgo. If you look close, when the debris and parts of the top of the London bridge falls on the military, the debris and parts from the bridge are bluish, or aqua. Some scenes are like that. When a piece of the side of the building falls on the people and the cars, IT LOOKS EXTREMELY BAD."
5,Mama Knows Best,"This was one of my favorites as a child.I must have seen this one over 25 times!!Its just a great 'forget about reality for awhile' type flick. The special effects for the time were state of the art. The creatures were robots which made it so more realistic than the Godzilla flicks.It still holds up even today.The acting was fine Bill Travers( Born Free) William Sylvester(2001- Space Odyssey).The score, the cinematography, were terrific! And SURPRISE! Much to all viewers delight it DOES NOT have a typical giant monster movie ending!!! Maybe this is the reason why its my favorite out of all of them! If you like this type of a flick you have to own it. Its monster movie folklore!!!"
4,finally a decent looking DVD,"This latest DVD of Gorgo from VCI is definitely the best qualityI've seen, after the numerous muddy and mediocre VHS and DVD versions that have been floating around, available in bargain bins and budget catalogs for years. It actually corresponds to my memory of seeing it on screen years ago as a child. And in fact it is one of the few ""big beast"" monster movies that is geared to the imagination of children, with some precocious environmental consciousness woven in. The message finally is that Mommy will always protect and take care of you in the end, even it means crunching half of London into rubble. Also, it's hard to watch the William Sylvester performance and not think of his role in Kubrick's 2001."
4,original twist on tired Vampire movies,"Cool and surprising, UK movie.The lead actress is attractive and perfoms very well as the submissive (at first)Vampire, who's blood is used as a drug, and sold to a select few.But when the drug pusher starts falling in love with her, the supply runs low-if you like intelligent vampire movies- then this is for you.well worth it.What other movies is this vamp babe been in??"
4,Women in History,"I'm appreciative of all women who have worked to improve the quality of life for women -- for me. I was surprised to learn that several of the women I've admired were lesbians -- Susan B Anthony, Eleanor Roosevelt, Jane Adams and Florence Nightingale. I'm not completely convinced that they were all lesbians but even if they were, you can't erase what they have accomplished. When I was in college we didn't have the option to focus on women's history. So I enjoy reading about the struggles and accomplishments of women. I admire strong women. I wonder if the history we study in school shelters us from the truth. It's easy to dismiss the contributions of a group if you don't know what or how they have contributed. To Believe In Women is an interesting perspective on our social history."
5,A great reference for your desktop,"I use Excel on a daily basis as part of my job and have an educational background in spreadsheet modeling. I have purchased a number of books searching for a one-stop desktop reference for the intermediate to advanced Excel user, and this is the best I've found! I frequently use it for help with nested array formulas, which are complicated (with a lot hard to remember rules) and powerful. The title is easy to understand and suitable for anyone has even a cursury understanding of Excel. I would highly recommend it - it is the only Excel reference you'll ever need."
5,Well Worth The Investment,You will earn back your investment in this book many times over. It is full of easy to use and understand examples which can be applied to many different situations.It will raise you to an EXCEL Guru level in no time.
2,Buy a different book,"The book was OK. I have been using excel for about 6 years and I needed something that was a little more geared to saving me time at work. The some of the tips were good but not for files that need to be shared (what good is it if someone doesn't know how to modify them). This book is decent but not as useful as advertised.I am now looking for a more practical book with pivot tables, VBA, and more analysis oriented tips. I wouldn't recommend this title if you are familiar with Excel from work or academic experience."
3,An avrage read,"This was the second fantasy book I ever read (after the Hobbit) and although I never got round to reading the trilogy I think that it's a decent book by itself. The action through out the mid-section of the book is'nt ground breaking but enough to keep you intrested. But the climax is very good. The last battle stretches over a couple of chapters and never lets you down where excitment is concerned. You'll enjoy the fight against the blood riders, Im sure."
2,The characters are the only redeeming quality...,"...and even that isn't good enough. Niles is an amateur, and marks himself as such clearly in this series. Predictability, boring descriptions, and poor sentence structure are everywhere in the novels, jarring the reader from their ""suspension of disbelief."" The characters might have been good, but Niles treats them one-dimensionally. Foreshadowing ineptly reveals the entire plot early, making the only suspense in the book the curiosity of who will be knocked off. The books follow the ""small problem / adventure / big problem / dramatic battle of epic proportions with lots of carnage"" formula that leaves little room for originality (kind of like the cheesy ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" series). All in all, the books are only worth it if bought for $2 or less used."
1,"I would give it none, but I cant.","The trilogy STINKS!!! The characters were bad, the story line was lame, and how do u kill a dracolich just by touching it with a stick??? The first book was the saving grace of the whole sorry thing. It was 2 1/2 stars, max. Sorry Mr. Niles, but that was the second most sorry trilogy I ever read. First being the Maztica Trilogy."
3,"Kraft Good Seasons Salad Dressing & Recipe Mix, Basil Vinaigrette","The dressing is good with any salad; however, I have found when it is mixed with Italian dressing it enhances the flavor of the Ceasar salad. It is also good when baking chicken."
5,Glad to see this flavor back!,Had a hard time getting this particular salad dressing for awhile but it's back and I am a happy camper. It has a nice delicate flavor that compliments lots of different combinations. It goes together so easy and quick and always fresh tasting. Love Good Seasons Salad Dressing mixes!
4,Wow!!!!,"I read this book way before it was even being considered for publishing, and let me say, I was really impressed. I liked it a lot, it's action-packed and full of lust, love, desire, magic, fantasy, and decision-making, it is really awesome. You may be confused in a part or two, but it'll all make sense in the end. I suggest you get this book now. I am in the process of reading the second one, so make sure you look for it in the future. This a great book, it's worth the money, so get it while ya still can."
4,tight Jam,"this was Prime time Snoop Dogg.this was the First cut on His Solo Album that got the Ball fully rolling.Snoop with his trademark flow&Vocals is still tight. the Vocals,production&vibe just captured a time in Hip-Hop that was on point.this is a really Good Jam."
1,Don't waste your money. Get the real Buddy Holly songs.,"If you like Buddy Holly's music, you might have a passing interest in Connie Francis' efforts. However, once you have heard her versions, you will wonder why she chose to call her album 'I Remember Buddy Holly'. The fact is, she proves that she doesn't. I bought the disc and have great respect for Buddy Holly's talent. Unfortunately, Ms Francis was more interested in making some quick money trying to sing, and in some cases, rework some of Buddy's material. Perhaps, the most unusual item is her version of Peggy Sue. Ms Francis did well enough with her own songs, but was less than successful with Buddy's. Buy it at your own risk."
3,search for deep lasting flavor in coffee,I had Farmer's gourmet dark roast (decaf) in a restaurant and it was outstanding. This Farmer's Gourmet Dark Roast (regular) didn't have any of the deep lasting pronounced flavors that the restaurant Farmer's had.
2,Not worth the extra price; not the same as restaurant fame,"I was disappointed. I was ready to re-experience the Farmers Brand of my restaurant memories and was thrilled to have found it online. I almost cancelled when the price and shipping equaled almost $20 a pound! Then, when brewing and tasting, I realized this was not a lot better than my store brand for which I could buy four for what this one container cost.Just not the same. Keep your money in your pocket."
4,Watching this DVD over and over again,If you buy a gospel DVD this year this is one to consider.The choir sings briliiantly and the soloists are really good (especially the hymn 'Trust and Obey').The sermons are inspirational and so are the songs.The video quality is excellent. My only gripe is that there is no 5.1 or DTS encoding. PCM is so sub standard and for this price I would expect no less than 5.1 encoding. (Which is why I gave it four stars and not five)Definantly worth the price!!!
3,Not for sports,"The product was fine but restrictive when taking action/sports shots where quick movement at close-in subjects is required. Would not dissuade anybody from buying it though. Solid construction. DON'T BUY FROM 17TH STREET PHOTO. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, HAS YET TO ANSWER THREE EMAILS, RUDE TELEPHONE REPRESENTATION."
2,Descend into Insanity 1 Page at a Time,"In another rehashed treatise on Savage's perverted sense of truth, he sells a miserable, peripatetic screed to his lemming-like followers. This man's politics and principles have been condemned by such well-established conservative journals as The Economist. We all need someone to trust, and for Savage that person is the MD who will prescribe him some thorazine. Gets 2 stars only because of the book's educational value as an example of the ramblings of a lunatic. Barry Goldwater must be spinning in his grave."
5,Savage is the man,"I loved this book. God bless Dr. Savage, he sure knows his stuff inside and out.Its so nasty, and sad that there are all of these hate mongerors out there trying to inflict harm on those who disagree with their extremist ideals.Thesre radicals will lose, and the truth will set us all free."
5,Great conservative book,I highly recommend this book. If you are tired of both political parties and need some incite into what is really going on with America - read this book.
5,Elixir for Liberals,Michael Savages' clear voice of reason rattles the cage that imprisons the minds of liberals. A great addition to his two other political books. Dr. Savage is a man who isn't afraid to tell it like it is.
2,Why do people attack the Dr's sexuality?,"Though I can't pretend to like the book what I like far less is the way most of the negative reviews seem to revolve around him being `in the closet' before going on to attack him for homophobia. The irony! And worth a few stars in vindication of at least part of his thesis.However though the loony left does exist, to suggest a national conspiracy on the part of the left is laughable in a historically conservative America and following two republican presidential terms. This smacks of invisible monster syndrome, lets face it we have enough problems post 9/11 without inventing extra ones! Trying to put ideology above economics, consumer demand and the physical sciences did not work for the Russians and it wont work for the Americans either. Americas success is and was built on pragmatism, the far left and the far right provide unworkable solutions."
1,Who the hell is Michael Savage?,I brought this book in good faith believing it would be an invaluable insight into actor Fred Savages hysterical right wing views only to be confronted with this idiots ramblings. Boring!
1,Limpid,"I wish this guy could live up to his own delusions. Ooh, liberalism is a mental disorder! Boy that sure teaches those libs! Alas the book merely gives a weary beer gut to back up that and other attempted ""outrageous"" statements. What did intrigue me about this book was that I kept picturing Michael as a fat little kid who was picked on and bullied, and now that he's uh ""grown up"" (well sort of) he's going to be one tough dude - or at least from the safety of a microphone. And true to those who have been trod upon too long instead of taking up the cause of the downtrodden Mr. ""Savage"" attempts to become one of the oppressors. All very psych 101 and explored with more interest in Orwell than here. But I suppose if you've had a few too many bong hits and Hannity is feeling a little to intellectual steep for you one might slum it out here if you need shelter from thinking, self dignity, or genuine virility."
1,Absolutely Pathetic Mindless Drivel Dravel,"I found this book to be absolutely pathetic with its mindless drivel dravel. This is coming from the same guy who says all people with AIDS should die. Savage is a homophobe of the first order and hates liberals. If you are a right-wing fanatic with no mind, you will love this garbage."
5,Insightful as always,"This book is an insightful look at the liberal methodolgy. Not as harsh as the title implies, it dissects the left's thinking and how it differs to the extreme from middle America."
5,The Most Important Literary Set Of Our Time,"Dr. Michael Savage is one of the most important conservative literary figures of our generation. This trilogy is required reading for every American not yet ready to hand over America's traditions, culture, and values, to the far left America-haters."
3,Very similar to radio broadcasts,"This book is a little bizarre. It is very interesting but you'll have to read it with a salt shaker handy (ie: needs to be taken with more than just ONE grain of salt..). But, just like his radio broadcasts, if you can filter through some of the stranger assertions you'll find some very interesting insights. And as one of the other reviewers stated, the research and cites are first rate. If you listen to his radio show regularly, you'll love the book. If you listen occasionally, there will still be some assertions that you'll find insightful or even enlightening. If you've never listened to Savage radio, you're in for an eye opener!"
2,Savage-maybe needs medication,"Savage goes by the classic rightwing tactic of taking on callers who might disagree with you. Mute them and then shout over them. Time tested and big mic advantage. Savage is a better author then some of these rightwing talk show books, I will give him that. He ignores though that liberals brought up women's right to vote, end of segreation (liberals and not necessary democrats as this is a difference), child labor laws etc. Things that conservatives eventually support over time. Americans will one day look back at people like Michael Savage and wonder why we in the present generation were thinking by supporting people like him."
1,you will love this book if....,"You are extremely stupid, incapable of independent critical thinking & think that even the most complex problems can be boiled down to simplistic, jingoist bumper sticker slogans. If you fit in that category - I highly recommend this book to you. Of course, if you are looking for something with a little more substance & reality - may I recommend the Harry Potter books to you?"
1,Fascism,"Savage has rightly been banned from entering Britain because of his hate-filled diatribes against everybody not exactly like him.In reply, he has now called on all Americans to boycott all British goods - so he has proved that he is no friend of Britain.With Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, he hates democracy: they are in truth modern fascists."
3,Some good ideas but...,"Michael Savage calls himself a nationalist. In that respect, he is more like Pat Buchanan than he is like mainstream conservatives. Although he rails against illegal immigration, I suspect he would also favor tight controls over the number of legal immigrants. He is also economically illiterate, hence his blind attacks on free trade and his support of a minimum wage. He makes some great points on the moral decay of Western civilization and he understands the left all too well in terms of their desire to replace capitalism and a republic with socialism. Unfortunately, the book is poorly written and looks like it was put together hastily with little to no research."
1,Savage is a moron,"I cannot even begin to fathom how this boys mind works. It seems he just wants to destroy all this nation has worked for. Throw away all acceptance, knowledge, rights, cultures, and just go back to the 1950's - if not earlier. Go back when people like him were in charge. He's a bigot, and racist, and anti-feminist. People like him need to be uncovered for the silly ideas they uphold, there are too many people out there who are blinded by people like him and need to be exposed to more factual based political commentary."
1,Today's conservative thought is sociopathy conning ignorance,"Cynical sociopaths are manipulating the ignorant, racist and homophobic toward following their highly destructive vision. This is what amounts to ""conservative thought"" these days - a type of conservative thought which would be unrecognizable to true conservatives of the past.Savage, as with his generation of putative conservatives, falls in line. He uses the mental illness offense against liberals just as the fascists in the USSR used it against their enemies...just as Hitler gassed the liberals. All fascists first attack the liberals and academics. And now as we have a very cynical sociopathic horde attempting to force fascism on our Republic, they bring this nonsense to our own nation."
5,"Strong point of view, not afraid to be an individual","On the Iraq war, there's lots of talk. I like Savage's idea of partitioning Iraq. But world politicians are on the path of one world, they don't want break ups, they want consolidations.Savage was on First Voice (www.firstvoicebooks.com) for this book. When I first heard his oil for food program, I rolled with laughter.That's the thing about Savage. He can stir you up. Some people don't want to stir."
1,Remarkable,"This moving biography of O.J. Simpson is essential reading for any American who considers himself a patriot. Mr. Savage spends the first half of the book focusing, oddly enough, on Joe Theisman and Carl Yastremski. But then he hits his stride, tackling Simpson's life with a thoroughness, and level of empathy, unseen in less comprehensive studies of the killer's narcissistic personality. Savage then surprises, at the end, with a stupendous reconsideration of Baldwin's Go Tell It On The Mountain, before concluding with some shocking, even lewd, takes on the blind, defenseless Helen Keller. All in all, this is a disarmingly ambitious performance, to be read in more than one sitting (but no more than two)."
1,"Want to know what evil really is, let me break it down for you....","What is evil?Evil is a man of high intelligence, verbally gifted, with good critical thinking skills, who willfully and knowingly makes a career out of inciting the latent fear and hatred lurking within us all. Evil is loving fame and money so much that this man finds a niche spreading the most hateful, paranoid, and violence-inducing propaganda imaginable, which he himself does not believe. Evil is this man using his verbal skills and intelligence to cloak this poisonous rhetoric in the garb of patriotism and religion."
1,Michael Savage is a Rectal Disorder,"Rants written by a pathetic, lonely old man who's still hurting over the fact that he never got his college professorship. He'll go to his grave insisting that he was qualified beyond everyone else; if he'd submitted this book or one of his previous diatribes, his interviewers probably would have called campus security right away. Written for other angry white men who can't come to terms with the fact that they are simply losers--so affirmative action, women, gays, lawyers, muslims and just about the rest of the world is at fault.A pathetic waste of paper and ink, but it's even more pathetic that there are people who lap this trash up."
1,Conservatism? Nope!,"I don't know what's happening to conservatives in the US, but this book has little to do with conservatism. What Dr. Savage espouses is much closer to fascism than anything else."
1,Savage indeed.,"The blueprint on mental disorders where the ""savage solution"" was the final solution carried to its conclusion by Jim Adkisson in Knoxville, Tennessee."
4,Savage is on the mark,"An honest, thought-provoking book. The ""savage"" language is his hallmark and leaves little doubt as to where Michael Savage stands on the important issues of today."
3,A Venomous Book.,"Michael Savages book ""Liberalism Is A Mental Disorder"" is a venomous and rathing critique of liberalisms effect on America today. The book had its ups and downs. I found the section regarding Muslim not being a religion of Peace and protecting our borders to be the most interesting parts of the book. Some of it became too political and his nicknames for government officials seemed a little immature and and unfunny. I do applaud Michael Savage for not just protecting bush but rather calling him a liberal aswell on certain aspects of his presidency. No one is safe from critique in this angry and bitter rant."
5,Simple Logic,"Dr. Savage has a wonderful insight into the liberal mind. He takes the liberal arguments and then shows how ludicrous they really are. Liberals, including those ""high ranking"" left wing politicians, don't even make sense when they speak. Why is it that most Americans can see the fault in the liberal lunacy but keep electing extremists? Not only has Dr. Savage spent the required time in researching this book, he uses the liberals own mindset against them, showing that they really have no position or solutions to what they say is the problem. I, along with many others, have come to the conclusion that the left has no real position. The only platform they ""pontificate"" from is ""let's just apologize for being Americans and let the rest of the world tell us what we should think and how we should act"". Excellent work from an excellent mind!!"
4,Time to save the country boys and girls!,"Be an adult and purchase a copy.Read the book and learn how dangerous the nuts on the left are becoming. As the Left would say, ""it will raise consciousnes.""You gotta love the Left's creativity, but should they have control over our country??"
5,Worth Reading,"Michael Savage is hard to ignore. He can be very funny, very entertaining, and very thought provoking. His belief in ""borders, language, and culture"" makes more than a little sense in these increasingly degenerate days. The President seems to be unable to understand what the flood of illegals is doing to the country. Savage can understand it, and speaks for those who are genuinely alarmed at what is happening to the country.Savage, in short makes sense. His chapter on illegal immigration is well worth reading. So, in truth, is the book. Americans are losing their country to a flood of problems, and the refusal of Americans to look at the dangers they are facing is frightening.Savage may or may not be agreeable to everyone, but his concern is real, and the points he makes are valid. He, at least, believes in the nation, and the good that exists here. So many seem to have lost all concept of what they have, and what they are losing.I appreciate the fact Savage wrote this book."
5,More truth from the only independent voice on radio,"Savage is unique because he is an honest intelligent well educated man who speaks from his heart. While you definitely will disagree with him on some issues, he always has a reason for his opinions and is willing to reevaluate those opinions in the light of the evidence. And he is never boring. In some ways this is the best of his politically oriented books because he is more comfortable with writing on these issues and there is less repetitive discourse than in the earlier books.Does Savage make the case for liberalism as a mental disorder? Surprisingly (I'm a recovering liberal) I believe he did. But read it for yourself, and if you still have any doubts that liberalism is indeed a mental disorder, then read any of the one star reviews below."
5,Sylvia-Straight Grandmother,"From the perspective of a straight Grandmother, Sylvia tells of her long sojourn of being ""pushed"" by God, to arrive at the conclusion that Gay people are indeed among God's children. This unique book tells of Gay people struggling with an orientation not yet accepted fully by heterosexuals. Sylvia, a beautiful person, spent the rest of her life ministering to hurting Gays everywhere, bringing God's love and acceptance. She also wrote: ""Good News For Modern Gays"" which deals with the Biblical ""clobber"" texts and ""Ex Gays? There Are None"" refuting claims Gays can be changed. A ""can't put down book."""
3,"Likeable, But Scarcely Above ""Made For TV"" Quality","The gay werewolf couple are endearing. The two old lady maids who plot to kill their mistress and lust in advanced age over the local Vicar are terrifying. The teenage girl who lusts after one of the wolves is spunky and forthright. Her kid brother is curious, fearless and honest to a fault... This could have been a much more interesting movie !This plays like a BBC 'made for TV' drama, but the BBC in considerably less than top form. The odd plot elements could have made for something highly unusual, but instead , you get British small town cliches.(Not so very different from American small town cliches ! The prejudiced townspeople, the repressed Vicar etc. etc.)The rural cinematography is gorgeous, but this in itself is a cliche of British small town drama."
3,Gorgeous window dressing and not much else,"Though the idea is inventive (gay werewolves - not exactly an overdone story), it is also underdeveloped. The stars are really nice to look at, but the plot is uninvolving, and the rest of the cast is unexceptional. Only buy it if you are interested in a post-party night, not too taxing, entertainment for a Sunday afternoon."
4,"Haunting, mind-blowing","This is one of those rare movies that upon first view it enthralled and frightened me with it's subconsious familiarity. From Boy George's first words of narration to the strange interaction of a local women to these two ""wolves"" I was hooked.And while it could be seen as simpistic. When have fairy tales ever been complex? A case could be made that the acting is all over the place. Have you seen Star Wars II?The great ""secret"" of this movie seemed a bit obvious. But considering the current stuff in the paper seems sort of precient.Entertaining. Sensual. Evocative. Strange."
1,GE PAR 20 Bulbs glass falling out!,I bought about 20 of these lights and now the glass keeps falling out of the bulbs and smashing on the floor. I would find a different manufacturer to buy from.
5,Loved it.,"I enjoyed this volume, one of my favorite series. Harima all day everyday, 24/7, 365, and 366 on a leap year."
2,Way Too Long,"I enjoyed the first two books in this series, but I was unable to finish this one, even after I started skimming about 150 pages into it. Very few writers can sustain a work of this length --- taken together, the three volumes run about 1,800 pages --- and the pacing wasn't lively enough to keep me interested.The series has some compelling concepts, and even the battle scenes in the first two were vivid enough to keep me interested, in spite of the mostly two-dimensional characters, but after a while it got very tedious for me. Stephen Vincent Benet, a great American story writer, once said that ""writing is the art of abbrevation."" Unfortunately, Stirling doesn't get to the point too often, and the plot is weighed down with long, windy descriptive passages that don't advance the story.Looks like most readers who liked the first two will enjoy this one as well, but it was too much for me."
3,A potboiler,"Well, if you have read some Stirlings, there are very few surprises here. The heroes always win on the whole, and I certainly agree with other reviewers who thought that the protagonists are a bit shallow and haven't been getting much better from the previous books onward. Some more shadows on their immaculate souls could have helped make them more believable.I also found it hard to care about some subplots, but as I said, it's a potboiler. Good enough to read if you like the general stuff."
3,Disappointed,"I was really expecting an ending to this trilogy that befit the action of the first two volumes. I was upset at the way this book ended...I mean, the resolution was kind of weak...and did anyone else catch the Draka-like qualities in this book that Stirling has presented in his other novels?"
3,It f-f-fades away...,I read the last 75 pages of this book with a feeling of dread. It had become obvious that all the threads were being gathered together for a quick and unsatisfying climax. There were far too many loose threads and 'oh yeah' sections to cover off all the leftover characters. The missing line at the end of the book was 'Stay tuned...' If Stirling is going to write a trilogy in four parts he should have the good taste to be clear about it. Or perhaps he could have done 5-10 pages to show us the new world of 199x and let us in on that secret.
2,Anticlimactic ending to an otherwise noteworthy series,"I loved the 1st book and was satisfied with its sequel, but I was sorely disappointed with this book. I guess I am so bitter, because I found the set up in the prior books to be really thought out and plausible. I became so invested in the characters and their fates, that I was really looking forward to this last book. The book was on par with the first two, I felt the set up led you to believe that the ending was going to be really good, but then it shifted and it just ended.. It feels as though the author was rushed to meet a deadline, thus ending the series abruptly. Spoiler***it was especially anticlimactic because the 2 leaders never faced offed, the evil leader was poisoned by some random person, that is never given credit for it. Even having him end that way could have been better written to give the reader satisfaction. I was so dissatisfied with the ending, I felt I wasted my time reading the 1st two books."
2,I am glad it is over.,"This novel was not nearly as good as the previous two. A fascinating premise and somewhat interesting characters, if sterotypical, made for some decent reading previously. I really bogged down in this book when the plot line became obvious. The conflict was resolved too easily and too simply. It was almost as though the writer didn't know what else to do with this convoluted plot. I made it through the book but struggled with my conflict between sheer boredom and keen interest. I would recommend that you read the series in order."
2,More of Same,"This series starts out with an interesting premise, but this third entry in the series really doesn't offer anything new. It's a competently enough written novel, but it just rehashes the same ground covered in the first two stories in the series.If you are a die hard fan of the Republic of Nantucket, then it's a must buy. Otherwise, it's OK but no Hugo winner."
3,Good story but little drama,"As always with Stirling's stories he constructs a believable alternate world using accurate depictions of ""real history."" This third novel of the series follow the same path as earlier stories but fails to build up to much of a dramatic climax. What happens to William Walker, his friends, and his empire may be realistic in terms of history but hardly makes for an exciting drama. Hopefully things will progress to a more exciting climax in the next series set in this alternate universe. On a different note I liked the recreation of the Battle of Rorke's Drift in Zululand in this novel, although I'm not sure how much of it had to do with the actual history versus the movie version of the same battle. Good job nevertheless in integrating the history with the fiction."
4,Mind the story,"Ever since I started reading SF (and alternate history) I have wondered why the genre is so often disregarded by ""mainstream"" literature. The IitSoT trilogy is a good example: a thrilling, well woven story, with (apparently) a lot of research into its writing. As I finished OtOoE, the last installment, I guess I finally found the answer. SF writers in general, and Stirling in particular, are great with the premises and plot, but are usually unable to provide depth to the characters. ""On the Oceans of Eternity"" ends nicely (although in a somewhat corny fashion) the adventures of the RON, but enthralling as he plot was - I kept wondering what would I've done were I in the characters shoes - the characters are doomed to early oblivion...That doesn't mean there weren't great characters in the book (like Rapuasha, Kash and the Hollards), only that they were somewhat underdeveloped.Overall, it is a great book, so forget the character depiction minor flaws and enjoy the story."
1,"Not Worth The Trouble, Unfortunately","This series starts out with a bang, with a terrific idea. Although there are interesting scenes, and I have no doubt that the author knows what he's talking about when it comes to every military tactic and the design of every sword, ultimately, it is a complete let down. I was so disappointed by the last book, that I wanted to send it back to the publisher for a refund. Maybe the author will write a proper ending."
3,Tim Robertson Review,"An okay book, but after a while I just wish the writer would move the story a little bit faster."
2,More of Same,"This series starts out with an interesting premise, but this third entry in the series really doesn't offer anything new. It's a competently enough written novel, but it just rehashes the same ground covered in the first to stories in the series.If you are a die hard fan of the Republic of Nantucket, then it's a must buy. Otherwise, it's OK but no Hugo winner."
4,Another thought-provoker by Mr. Stirling,"More of Mr. Stirling's ""Change"". The effect of modernity on the ancient world are explored - another interesting read in this series."
4,Great book for these times,This book is about very serious matter and judging by the cover it says it all.A good read for tough guys who may feel better reading something like thisthan other war hero stuff and other heavy actions ect.
5,"Another one of the ""change"" novels...","Oh my... A friend of mine suggested these for the hubby for a present. Yeah, nice talking to you! He has been sucked in and taken away! It's especially cool, because we live by where these are set. A GREAT set of books!"
2,A better read,"I agree with the writtings of the one and two star reviewers. I would add a much better read is Eric Flints 1600 series. The 20th centuary people go down to the 18-19th century level and the 16th centuary folk basicly stay at that level. The HS library gives knowledge of the lives of the 16th Cen. people and enables them to change it. It is NOT like the Nantucket library that somehow gives info on how to make advnced 18th Cen. weapons.Inc. sailing ships with cannon of all things and Gattleing guns. Give Flint's books a look at,they are much better."
3,A fragmented excuse for a novel,"A must have book if you have read the other two - but... The previous format of jumping from one area to another has been used to the extreme in this novel. This could be justified if it was necessary to tie all the parts together for a grand finish that depends on timing between the various groups but this never occurs. Instead you get 32 chapters with 3-4 jumps in each - forcing (this reader at least) to either constantly refer to the chapter headings (not always helpful - who is currently in Damacus etc?), or lose the impact of the first few paragraphs until you are sure of where you are. I can't help thinking this would have worked much better as a main story vs Walker's forces, along with two attached short stories, one with Alston and Swindapa vs Isketerol and the other with the Rangers out West. Additionally, the whole Egyptian thing was originally a short story that has been weakly attached to the book."
3,Still too much to follow... and make sense of,"Well, I finished it. And I still mourn the lost stories of the years between Island in the Sea of Time and Against the Tide of Years. Perhaps Mr. Stirling can fix that :) Or maybe fanfic!Like AtToT, there are a lot of characters, history, geography, politics to keep track of. Actually way too much for me. There is so much ground to cover, and an emphasis on history and geography, that character depth remains shallow.That's why I've found his last two books in this trilogy less than satisfying. I'm a character reader... and the characters and situations from Island in the Sea of Time enchanted me. I still read that book over and over to remind myself that Stirling can write character depth."
3,Not as good as the first two in the series,"This is the third in the series and I beleive the last. You almost need to read the first two ""Island In The Sea of Time"" and ""Against The Tide of Years"" to realy enjoy this one as the premise and most of the real character developement was done in the previous two, which is why I rated this only 3 stars while the other two deserve 4 stars.The story is the continuation of the Island of Nantucket being sent into the far past and this book resolves the majority of the islanders taking care of the rogue element that is taking advantage of the natives.I read the book 1632 by Eric Flint (which I liked immensely) and Stirling was recommended as an author who would also be liked, so I read his series. I felt Stirling's story (3 books) to be much meatier and more realistic then Flint's story, but if you enjoyed this series and time travel , DO read 1632 for a light enjoyable dessert."
3,Mixed and Disappointed feelings,"Was hoping for a better ending to the trilogy than what happened. Didn't we keep reading because we wanted Walker and (at least for me) Hong to get theirs? It was way too much.. "" and then the battle was over"" As another reviewer mentioned, when I got down to 75 pages I realized that Stirling was going to cheat and rush the climax. Although it is blatently obvious that another book (or even trilogy) is potentially in the works, don't think I'll bother. (Could Marian really survive another war?)"
3,Nantucket rules the world.,"While not as fine as the two preceding novels, Oceans is the end of one of the greatest alternative history series ever written. It is long, consists of a cast of thousands, the lesser ones easily lost in the mix, and can get a little tedious. But, if you're hooked on the series and the author, (I readily admit to both), it's necessary reading."
3,More obvious plot contrivances than in first 2 books,"I really enjoyed the first two books, but found the third a bit disappointing. Part of that is because much of the action seemed like slightly-changed versions of action in the earlier books -- and part of it is that the plot ""twists"" seemed more telegraphed and clumsy. In the earlier books the plot seemed to flow more naturally out of the situation, the characters, and events. This time there were several occasions where the hand of the author moving chess pieces around became overly obvious, and it interrupted my ability to get lost in the story. Still enjoyed it though."
3,Losing steam at the end - but a reasonable wrap up,"In general, I thought Stirling did a good job of maintaining the pace and texture of the series in this final volume. Initially, I was surprised by the fate of Walker and Hong, but now feel it was actually more credible than the ends such characters often meet in this type of literature. The really sour note for me was Stirling's virtually detail by detail, incident by incident, character by character rip-off of the screen-play from the 1964 movie, ZULU. Unexcusable, and maybe actionable. Makes one only wonder how much more in these books is owed to authors other than the one whose name appears on the cover."
2,Plagiarized scenes,"I'm very disappointed by the fact that Mr. Stirling plagiarized scenes from the movie Zulu for portions of this book. I was loving the series and reading it as fast as I could when I came across scenes virtually copies from the movie. I've enjoyed everything Mr. Stirling has written so far, but this was just very, very disappointing to me."
1,Lame Ending for OK Series,"At the risk of repeating what others have said here, the ending of this series was a monumental let-down. The reader's impression is that the author suddenly tired of the entire concept and decided to wrap it up as expeditiously as possible. The conclusion is so lame that I would recommend you not even get started with this series."
4,From a New Admirer,This is my first experience in reading a Rebus story. I can not wait to read more of the series although I think I will have to wait a bit because Rankin writes a dark book. A few weeks in between will be necessary.I will not repeat the plot which others have summarized. I would say that there are many questions about Rankin and I wlll read the rest of the series in order so I can see Rebus' development. I am very interested in watching the development of the relationship between Siobhan Clarke and Rebus. One of the interesting parts of the book there is little description of Siobhan.The plot has many turns but the strength is not the trick ending but the characters that are met. There are no American writers like him.I really enjoyed this effort.
3,A very winding road,"It kept me hooked, but there were so many characters and scenariosgoing on, it was a little confusing. No great payoff until the end. My friend guessed the ending by reading the back cover."
2,Routine,"After all the fanfare leading up to the appearance of ""A Question of Blood"" in the US, I found this novel vastly overrated. There is nothing new here. Inspector Rebus is a loner cop who Doesn't Play by the Rules. His sidekick, Siobhan Clarke, is slightly more interesting, and of course she Doesn't Play by the Rules either. The crime is not hard to solve and the book is easy to put down. The plot lacks urgency. Disappointing."
3,The title is the key,My first experience with Rebus and perhaps my last. His biggest fan is undoubtedly his lady side-kick.Why does he make life so difficult?
5,Inspector Rebus Mysteries,This book was received as described; on time and in excellent condition. This is one of my favorite authors and one of my favorite mystery series novels.
3,Meh~,"Fans of the Rebus series tell me I should have started with the first book. Maybe so. This was entertaining enough, but a little predictable. I did not find the characters compelling, and in fact found Rebus a little pointlessly manipulative. Frankly, I got a little tired of his unprovoked bursts of temper, and by the end of the novel was glad to be rid of him. Oh well."
3,Not His Best But Still A Joy,"Have read and enjoyed all of Ian Rankin's John Rebus novels,but I found this onea little to convoluted to rate more then three stars. The play between Rebus andSiobhan Clarke are a joy and it seems to get sharper and better all the time. The plot was very interesting,but the ending was too obvious. Would have liked more between Gill Templer and Rebus, I always found their relationship very interesting.All in all a good book."
5,My first Rebus novel,My first Rebus novel and I like him. Only to discover that his career comes to an end in two more books. I enjoyed the interaction between Rebus and Clarke. I visited Edinburgh in the 1980's and very much enjoyed the city. Rankin's writing brings back memories of my visit. I will eventually get around to reading the rest of the Rebus stories and hope that Ranking continues with Siobhan Clarke.
5,A very good mystery,"I had the pleasure of hearing Ian Rankin speak while he was on tour. Enjoyed him so much, although I had never read any of his novels. I immediately got myself a Kindle version of ""A Question of Blood"". I spent a whole Sunday reading, I just got so interested I couldn't put it down. A compelling mystery, interesting protagonist, provocative back stories. I am happy to be hooked on Rebus & Ian Rankin & am looking forward to more Sundays spent immersed in these fascinating stories."
3,it's very good movie,"Geet movie is released in 1970. Rajendra Kumar, Mala Sinha are the leading actors in this film. This film is directed by Aandaji Veerji Shah. And produse by the Ramanand Sagar."
1,Now Worth the Money,"This book is nearly Sixty dollars, which makes it more expensive than any other book in its category. For all the money you would expect thorough explanations, a few practice tests, maybe even color.Well you will be disappointed! This book explains things poorly, and does not even offer explanations. At Sixty dollars for a copy I think I deserve explanations and a book without typos on nearly every other page.I called the publisher and asked for the explanations for someof the problems, and I have yet to hear back from her.Do yourself a favor do not buy this book, but if you do hold on to the receipt because you will want to send it back.!"
2,XAM Math High School (Ftce Series),Material not covered adequately. Dont rely solely on this book - you wont pass...
1,oh give me a break,"I see, some guy kills 7 people, and we're all supposed to be in awe of his many followers who write him love letters. You gotta be kidding me? I don't know what's worse, the fact that hundreds of people write to him to profess their admiration or that his lawyer published a book his letters.Would all of these Christians be so forgiving of Berkowitz if he hadn't converted to christianity? You know the answer to that one. What a waste of paper, and a pathetic reflection of our society."
3,good,good for the price didn't come with fuse dat sucks but ok going to run 0 gauge to a 2000 watt sound stream tx1
4,This is an excellent product,"I love Source Naturals, and am pleased with the quality of this product. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is that I prefer to take my alfalfa in capsule form."
2,Size....,"It would be nice to know the LxWxH of the cage so I can know if this would be the proper cage for my Conure. This seems like a cuter cage for a child, or a lady with little birds."
4,Great stuff,I really like the Doobies with Michael McDonald - but the pre-MM Doobies are so much better. It's just that they were more of a band of musicians playing together rather than something that was produced in the studio. Their music just seems fresher and more creative with more variety to me. This and Stampede are the ones that I like the best. 4 1/2 stars if I could.
4,Jesus is Just Alright,I bought this cd for this song. There are a couple of others that are good too. The Doobies are a favorite group of mine.
5,I Doobie-lieve it's a Gem!,"Toulouse Street was the ""breakout"" Doobie Brothers album which spawned such rock classics as ""Listen to the Music,"" ""Jesus Is Just Alright"" and ""Rockin' Down the Highway."" But the hidden gems are the more acoustic numbers---""Snake Man,"" ""Cottonmouth"" and the title song ""Toulouse Street,"" which compares favorably to Simon and Garfunkel's ""Scarborough Fair"" in its clarity and beauty.The wonder of it, is that the songs remain vital even now, 28 years since the album's initial release in 1972. Without a single ""B"" cut, it's a ""must have"" in any pop music collection.Like the song says, ""Listen to the music..."""
5,This book is a food for thought when we are in pain,"This is a must read for anybody under going any kind of pain and suffering. It is very important to believe in something strongly either God or medical treatment and firmly stick to it. It is amazing how Africian Americans strongly beleived in God , despite the dreadfully life in American. It thought me that God in its infinite goodness is inexhaustaible when it comes to his grace for his children. By reading this book you will learn the other aspites of life that is so enriching despite lack of material wealth but just with faith in Christ. There are many lessions to learn for everybody from this book either from the power of Jesus or from practical faith on something."
3,exactly what you'd expect,"detailed enough. it's one of the few atlases of this area so i didn't really have too many options. serves its function, though!"
4,swank deep house.,"Excellent house, soulful without being unintelligent, funky without being cliched. The songs don't have that ""made for club consumption"" feel that you get from, say, Naked Music. A very warm and personal album and very much worth owning."
1,Garbage !,Half these CD's didn't work. Buy another brand. The worst I've ever used and I'm a recording engineer.
5,Good Quality,"Had these before. Good Qualioty, great deals at Amazon, makes me stay home to order them"
1,Stupid,"In the middle of the pack, I get two pitch-black cd's! You can't write information on a black cd! It's ridiculous."
5,Most important new framework of organizational behavior,"Mrs. Schein Organizational Culture framework must be one of the most important ones to study and understand organizational behavior. Mr. Schein's clinical psychology approach lead us to a very deep explanation about what kind of personal, groups and organizational dynamics are involved in the process of stability and change in an organization. A very interested framework including inconscious references. The clinical diagnostic approach Mr. Schein offers here is a very interesting methodology every organizational research or practitionaire must know and think about."
2,cheap quality,"Feels cheap, light weight for specific purposes is ok, however, the edges are very sharp and could cut you. Things could get burned really easilty because of the thinness of pot. I almost thought the pot would melt once, defeating the purpose of camping with a campfire for your stove."
2,does nothing my old fryer can not...,"I got this expecting crisper fries etc..but they seem soggier..follow all the directions but not impressed. Several things wrong with this. I do not have children so not happy with these ""magnetic"" plugs..They pop off very easily..There should be a provision to have a normal plug for more stability. The other thing I do not like is the gimicky filtration system. Most of the crumbs stick along the sides of the container and fall between the little space of the strainer and container..therefore they go to the bottom and never get filtered out...plus..cleaning is a chore..to many parts to take out and clean..The filter does nothing..same greasy smell in the house..My old unit had 2 pieces...basket and unit. Also goes up to 400 degrees...this goes to 375..maybe that is why things come out somewhat soggy and greasy. Taking it back and digging out the old cheapo fryer...save your money."
2,"Just out of warranty, FIRE!",Great fryer for 12.5 months. Thermostat burned up and got hot enough to melt it's plastic housing. It sent molten flaming bits of plastic on to my counter top and filled my kitchen with smoke.
2,"T-Fal FR400750 Ok, but died young","I bought this unit from a warehouse store. It is not model FR4008002, but instead is model FR400750, but judging from the picture and reading the description and reviews, I believe it is the same model. It seemed to work just fine, although some recipes ask for temperatures above 375F; which this unit cannot handle. My gripe is that I used it about 10 times total, over the course of about 2 years, and then it died. At first, it just stopped heating, and the reset button needed to be reset in order for it to heat up again. This happend about 3 or 4 times. But now, it completely died. No light, no heat. I'm currently looking for a replacement. Waste of money."
3,Was OK while it lasted,"Worked just fine for about 2years. Must have just burned out, doesn't light up doesn't heat up....dead. The screen catches about 75% of the crumbs, so you will still need to strain the oil to reuse. Food came out fine, usually used it near the highest setting."
1,Overrated,"My wife bought this CD as she's a Mary J Blige fan, and even she made a comment about it not being as good as her other CDs. To be honest I think she is incredibly overrated as a singer, and this CD shows that all too clearly. I assume it's been overdubbed in parts, as she's not as off key as I have heard her in other gigs (Superbowl, Grammys, etc.).If you like this sort of thing I guess it's OK, but it's not really my thing. I think what I dislike more than anything else is how she is touted as such a great singer, but you can hear that she sings flat throughout this (she often sings flat on her studio CDs too though), and she oversings some songs to the point where her voice cracks.I would say if you're going to buy her CDs, stick to the studio albums, as they don't expose her vocal shortcomings as much."
5,If you never buy another music dvd then buy this one!!,"What a voice, what a show, what a singer you are Mary. I sat down with two of my closest friends the other night and we watched your concert take us through your life. We felt like we were right there in the auditorium with you, your voice live is utter perfection and the feelings you put into your music is unquestionable. I cannot rate this dvd highly enough - 100 out of 10."
4,Well done,"The book reminds me of an all-time classic, ""Mechanics of Composite Materials"" by Robert M. Jones."
2,"Disjointed, disappointing","Living in Wyoming, I am attracted to books about Wyoming. This book was a great disappointment - it is too disjointed and is full of exaggerations."
3,A woman in Wyoming,"Gretel Ehrlich does for the state of Wyoming what other writers have done for other states: Terry Tempest Williams for Utah, Robert Michael Pyle for Washington, Bernd Heinrich for Maine, Jennifer Price for California, Scott Russell Sanders for Indiana. She has given it a space on the literary map. In this book she makes no really brilliant discoveries, which isn't surprising given that she is a relative newcomer to the ranch life she attempts to describe. She can be faulted, I think, for her idealized depiction of the lifestyle and landscape on a Wyoming ranch, and she never addresses some of the hard issues, such as reconciling the ranchers' alleged intimacy with the land with their pillage of that same land. But the prose is beautiful, and her insights about people and landscape are sound. I would tentatively recommend this book, but if you haven't read anything by Terry Tempest Williams, read her books first."
2,Where was the editor?,"Highly praising blurbs on the back from big guns: Tracy Kidder, Annie Dillard, Ivan Doig, and Edward Abbey. Yes, Ehrlich is literary and poetic about the landscape and weather, about the pain and dirt and beauty of sheep and cowboys and Indians in Wyoming--but she ladles it on a little thick at times, in my opinion. And, in describing a Crow Fair gathering she writes, ""John Whiteman, the last surviving Custer scout, rode on the back of a big ton truck. . ."" This book was published in 1985. Give her a half-dozen or so years since she wrote that sentence, and draw your own conclusions! (Curley, at about age 20 in 1876, was the youngest of Custer's scouts.)"
5,Well Written,"I first read this book when i was a junior in college. It was my last block of the year. When i first though of Nature Writing i think of Transcendentalism with Thoreau and Emerson. Though this book among others changed my mind.Ehrlich writes of living in Montana and during cattle drives. The details of life in the far west are great. The descriptions of what cow hands do with a years worth of money still, by blowing it on booze and fun it great. The book can be slow at times, yet I feel that this is deliberate in that cattle herding can be slow. In some ways the books is evenly paced. When she talks about the reasons for going to Montana to live there for a time one has to wonder if you, yourself, could do that. I know that for me the answer would be no.This book is for anyone who likes reading about American Nature Writers."
3,The Solace of Open Spaces,"This was more a personal essay than anything and of course that was the intention of the author. But all in all I could not get through it. It was not that interesting and the writing style was lacking for my taste.However, it was pretty good at times and being a writer my self I have to admit that just because I didn't like it to a 5 star extent doesn't mean it was bad."
3,Interesting but not groundbreaking,"This book offers a good description of what rural Wyoming life is like from the perspective of a newcomer. Unfortunately, it too often relies on the caricature of Wyoming rather than digging toward the truth of life in Wyoming. Of course, this is not surprising given the fact that Ehrlich wrote this book only having lived in Wyoming for a few years. You'll learn about Wyoming by reading this book. But realize that not every place is beautiful, that not every person is some quiet, semi-psychotic loner, and that Wyoming is much more complex than the cliches that Ehrlich presents."
4,Open spaces have always attracted me.,Wide landscapes and open land as far as the eye can see have always been a draw for me. The middle of a very large city can be so confining if you don't have the time/money to get out frequently and that is what this book does for me.I read it 25 years ago and had since lost my copy and I'm glad Amazon had one ready to shoot to me. I'm in a different mindset (along with being 25 years older) but same feelings are here. Gretel Ehrlich's story is of personal loss and the strength to make it through.
4,Worth reading,I did not get my impressions of what a cowboy was from Hollywood. Instead I grew up in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming and talked to the people in this book every day on the streets of the small towns there. What this book did for me was to remind me of the childhood notion of manhood that I had and help me to strip away some of the garbage that had been piled on me by the Political Correctness movement of the late 1980s.
5,Great new ideas in this book,"I attended AIRS classes several years ago and they changed the way I recruit and how I use the Internet. This book covers even more territory than the classes I attended, and has opened my eyes in new ways again. My company uses newspapers, job boards and job fairs to recruit, but there's no question we get the best candidates when we use AIRS techniques. AIRS is definitely the leader in this field, and seems to keep coming back with fresh new ideas. Highly recommended for anyone in recruiting or HR."
5,Live from Nashville by Daniel O'Donnell,The above product arrived quickly after I received a message that it was coming. The DVD is great. I am a great fan of Daniel O'Donnell so this added to my collection. I cannot wait for volume 2 to come out in March.
2,A little tired,"This video is a little boring. The format is alphabetical by country and gets a little redundant and tired, not to mention the music begins to wear on your nerves. But if you love soccer, you will still enjoy some of these highlights."
2,Doesn't taste like Caesar...,"I had read the reviews and so I ordered the Good Seasons Caesar Dressing. I was really disappointed that it didn't taste at all like Caesar dressing. I do remember reading that one person said that he/she didn't think it tasted like Caesar, but with all the good reviews, I took a chance. I am just as disappinted in all bottled ""Caesar"" dressings as well as in the many recipe's I've tried. Wish this had been ""the"" dressing, but sadly, it wasn't."
4,Excellent,"This is a delicious salad dressing that was not easy to find in my local stores. It is also available in bulk plus free shipping makes it so very convenient to keep from running out. No wonder some people go into a panic when they occasionally find that it's out of stock of thier favorite things! So far, I've never run completely out before receiving that notice! Good Seasons Caesar is the only salad dressing my husband wants, & he eats LOTS of salad. I buy the wishbone Italian sometimes for myself; & I experiment with various vinegars, oils & other ingredients like fresh oregano, etc. in both Caesar & Italian. I've read some reviews that reported Good Seasons dry mixes to be the best-tasting salad dressings on the market,"
4,This is the real stuff.,"You have to love Tom Doak for his honesty. He's not afraid to take aim at the big names in the business and tell us what he really thinks about the hundreds of golf courses he's played. I'm told the original version is much more scathing and I wish he'd published that version. It would have made the book even better. While the book is expensively produced, many of Doak's photos are too dark: perhaps there was something wrong with the production of my copy. For afficionados of golf course architecture, this book is a must-have, even though it will dent your golf budget."
3,Fun to look through but ...,"As a golfer, I enjoy just about any book on golf course architecture. This one included. BUT Doak is on the arrogant side. He reviews courses he has not played; and in one case, puts a review of a course in the book that he has not even seen because he got lost trying to find it! And, in some cases his descriptions of the courses are simply erroneous. One wonders just how much ""study"" he did of each of the courses reviewed in this book. Still worth it ... esp. at Amazon's discounted price."
5,Great citrus press!,"This is a great citrus squeezer and I am surprised at how hard it was to find. A friend got one years ago at Williams Sonoma but they don't carry it anymore. I actually prefer theirs as it is solid aluminum, but I searched high and low and this is the only one I could find of this model. The orange coating makes it easy to find, but I don't think it is supposed to go in the dishwasher, so it may as well be all aluminum (prettier). I have other citrus squeezers that are round that are available everywhere. Although those work, this one gets more juice out and is easier to squeeze. Also, you can squeeze the lemon/lime anywhere and then pour it into the measuring cup or dish. With the others you have to squeeze over a vessel. This one you squeeze and pour later as the spout is up high. I have not tried it for oranges but think it would work for smaller ones."
3,Are they serious? $15 for ONE ball???,"Sky Bounce (usually) makes good balls, they are often used for Big Ball handballtournaments in the NYC area...and commonly used at the local parks. My reason forthis review is to inform the masses that these balls are typically sold for$1 or $2 at local stores (in the NYC area)! How can any legitimate retailerpossibly sell them for $15 (and where on earth do they *list* for $25 EACH??!!!!).Maybe the price is per dozen or half-dozen???? :-oBefore you pay more than $5 per ball, buy a Penn or Ektelon racquetball at yourlocal sporting goods store for about $2/ball!!!"
1,Handball,In brooklyn or maybe New york all the handballs are for a dollar maybe because in new york handball is a commonly game we played.
5,The Blues but not music.,"This is a story of two girls who's mom is having drinking problems. The eldest is asked to take her little sister with her to Chicago. There is only one delima she doesn't want to stay with her, she wants to go home. They are having problems with getting along when suddenly their dad shows up and he is not approved by the eldest. He is always staying out late with her little sister without asking her. Are her problems solved? That's something you'll just have to find out when you read the book. This easy read book catches your attention and you can't put it down once you start!"
5,Really good book,"Applets are fully explained, thoroughly documented and easily understood. I really enjoyed reading this book (in fact I am currently reading it for the third time)."
1,Basically an advertising piece for Dr. Gray's techniques.,"This book is filled with testimonials for John Gray's approach to relationship development and enhancement. The overriding theme is essentially, ""And then I read Dr. Gray's book"" (or, preferably, ""attended my first seminar"") ""and my live was changed forever."" There are a few allusions to the specifics of his theories, but basically the jargon is used and the reader is assumed to be familiar with the subject already. The book has been marketed as a collection of real-life experiences of ordinary couples, with many of whom the reader should be able to identify, but this is not the case at all. It is a glowing ""puff piece"" which reads as if it had been drawn from the evaluation forms submitted by couples at the end of his seminars. I am not disputing the significance of Dr. Gray's insights and presentation in the slightest, just the thrust of this book."
4,"Liked, Wished The Manga Was Longer","Liked the anime, wished it and the manga wre longer.It is such a good story.Why did the mangaka kill off Ran after only a few years,which ended the manga?"
5,An objective look at the culture of the Tuareg,"First published in 1977, The Tuareg: People Of Ahaggar by Jeremy Keenan is an even-handed and objective look at the culture of the Tuareg people of the central Sahara, who are perhaps most famous for a fierce defense of their homeland against French imperialism, a struggle which ultimately resulted in the expulsion of France from Algeria in 1962. Part history, part anthropology, The Tuareg: People Of Ahaggar is offers an historical analysis which is very highly recommended for Mideast Studies reference library collections."
3,"Good, but not Great","This college guide is good at giving you some quick facts (sat scores, background, number of students, etc.) about colleges you may be interested in, but it leaves out too many colleges in my opinion. It doesn't have any of the California State Universities (CSU, although it does mention the 3-tier California system. It also leaves out many private schools that I think are worth noting in a book such as this. One thing i would like to talk about is financial aid that colleges award, but it doesn't mention it at all. 3-stars because is leaves out too much, but is great on what is there."
3,Average book - Roger Craig's book on the same season is better,"If you are a Tiger fan, you might find it an interesting read, particularly if you didn't experience it. However, for the most part this is a very vanilla book. In fact, if I had to get this book or pitching coach Roger Craig's book, I'd get Craig's.Tiger fans should get it if they can get it for a cheap price (say $12 or less). Others might find it interesting, but don't set yourself back too much in terms of price if you aren't a Tiger fan."
3,Elementary,"It was interesting to read about the inside of the team, but it was written on about a third grade reading level. I got through it it one evening. I would recommend for those under 13 but it's pretty elementary reading for anyone with an eight grade or higher education."
5,ALMOST FAMOUS EP,YUNG BERG'S DEBUT ALBUM IS THE CD OF THE YEAR. HE IS MY FAVORITE AND THE BEST NEW ARTIST OF THE YEAR. HE HAS THE BEST EP ALBUM EVER. AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS ALBUM THEN GO GET IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Jekyll + Hyde (Bryan Fisher),"The movie came without its proper/original case which I disliked. The movie overall is good but i'm not willing to pay the extra shipping and handling for it as it isn't THAT great. Yet, this is by far the best version of Jekyll and Hyde if you're familiar with the story/movie."
3,Boring,"I guess you have to watch the show, because reading it is boring. Even when you know the characters. Not sure why, but i didnt enjoy it."
1,Bad fitment and low quality materials,"I bought this rear drivers side door handle by Kool Vue to fit a 92 Camry XLE along with several other door handles from another manufacturer. This one was extremely difficult to get the bolt to grab properly at the back of the handle (also in a very hard to reach spot). Unless you can get the thing screwed down tight, the handle will not lift enough to actually open the door. It did not line up very well so it took a very long time to even get it to work. Also, this was a much cheaper plastic than the others and has a textured, matte finish so it does not match the other door handles I bought from the same seller."
2,Faith and Fate: A Short Cultural History of the Hungarian People through a Millennium,"Rather dry reading but the basic history, which is what I was looking for, was provided."
2,First-gen TabletPC to avoid.,"It's not the worst tablet to own, but it doesn't hit any of the sweet spots for a tablet other than WiFi abilities.1) It's not convertible, so you have to buy a USB keyboard for data entry.2) It's not using WindowsXP for Tablets, so you don't get the integration of Microsoft's specific handwriting recognition abilities.3) The hardware is pitiful, clearly offering power-saving compromises to overcome some engineering problems. The CPU is slow, the RAM is limited, and your hard drive isn't exactly fast or large.The best of the first-gen tablets was the Fujitsu Stylistic, but it cost twice as much. Of course, it also had twice as much ability. For tablet shoppers, the second-gen offers WindowsXP for Tablets, Office 2003 with OneNote (really leverages the tablet's strong points), better CPU selections and more mature engineering (convertibles!). Toshiba's Portege 3500 is probably the best tablet in the second generation, and that's the one you buy.Fred"
1,CPU too slow for WinXP's hefty hardware requirements,"A 800 Mhz Celeron CPU doesn't cut it. MAYBE if they had included Windows 2000, but WinXP needs a 1.5 Ghz or higher cpu to feel snappier.I still don't know what's the hype with the ""tablet PC"" idea.I recommend a SONY VAIO P4 notebook, instead of this."
3,"Catches 90% of spam, but buggy","I don't understand the person who said it didn't catch much of anything. I'm up to over 100 spam a day and increasing and Spamkiller catches most of it. It seems to get hung up now and then however and I can't trace the root. Anecdotely, it seems to get hung up on blank sender emails, but that is conjecture. It also just plain hangs up now and then. I just upgraded from version 2 to 4 and I still have the same issues. I don't see the complaint anywhere else on the net, so don't know if it my system (I'm still limping along with Win95 at the moment. When I first got it, I was ecstatic. There is the extra step between spamkiller and my email program (I pop with Outlook express). But it saves me from all the web bugs and activeX attacks in spam and removes the insanity of weeding through the spam myself."
1,Hopelessly confusing and ineffective,"Has there ever been a program so obtuse and frustrating to use as SpamKiller? What a horrible waste of time to try to make this work. When McAfee purchased DeerSoft and their wonderful Spam Assassin Pro system, I purchased the McAffe program assuming it was Spam Assassin Pro. It isn't. This is pure rubish."
1,"The Invasive, Uninvited Security Center","SpamKiller installs the McAfee Security Center without user permission. It is nothing more than an intrusive marketing scheme by McAfee that tells the user which McAfee products are installed. It necessitated a reboot several times when it ""hung"" my computer. It cannot be uninstalled unless ALL McAfee products are also uninstalled. It is an excellent reason to avoid the purchase of this product and ANY McAfee product unless McAfee changes its aggressive marketing strategy. There is too much excellent competition to accept nonsense of this type."
1,Don't waste your time with it!,"First of all, it only blocked 60% of the junk emails. not a good batting average by any standards.It's very hard to use. Takes forever to delete or block a message. Why? I'm using DSL, connection speed is pretty consistent. Tech support is no help what so ever.For couple days I didn't have any message. at first I thought maybe it's the ISP. Then I remembered I can check my email online. Turn out Spam Killer is not working for some reason. Maybe too much junk mails. I cleaned up the mailbox and Spam killer worked again.The last thing pushed me over the cliff is the program will delete everything in the accepted email folder when I simply asking it to delete or block one message. An error will come up and then everything is gone.Deleted the thing from my computer, now everything is back to normal. I can live with the spam, can't stand this POS!"
1,Inconvenient,"Not happy with this product. Works as a stand alone software. Does not reside within your email software. So you have to go into SpamKiller first, view your messages and then go to your email software and get your mail."
1,complete garbage,problems:1) only checks the inbox for hotmail accounts. (mail in the junk folders and bulk mail folders still show up in outlook express)2) doesn't support ssl (check to see if your email requires)3) doesn't support imap.4) poor interface.there are a ton of free spam programs out there stick with one of those.
1,"Might be good, but I couldn't figure it out.","McAfee Spamkiller 4.0 is so bad I am sorry I spent [the money] on it.1. Very difficult to use.2. Rescue option is dumb. They should just leave the email on the server then delete it when you confirm it is spam. This would save me from having to ""rescue"" (re-email myself) the message.3. The exit option is greyed out and I can't find an ""option"" for load a bootup so I am going to have to uninstall it to make it not load."
2,Not as happy as others,"I didn't realize that this would work in front of my Netscape Mail...all my mail went to SpamKiller, even the messages that I approve of, and I could not print off anything from there..I could not figure out how to forward on to my Netscape mailbox so I could in fact deal with it there, forward, print, etc..Finally I uninstalled it and decided I would try another as-of-yet decided product...too complicated for me, I need a product that works within the email product, not in-front of..."
2,mcafeee spamkiller,I bought the security suite and now find that it is nearly impossible to get assistance. They have blocked me from logging onto e-bay and refused to accept my acknowledged password. My account was locked and I still seem unable to unlock it with their new assigned password (which was given after they refused to accept the one I have always used before. I am not happy with my inability to get on e-bay even after submiotting the appropriate overrides. Terrible software until they fix this problem for me. Don't buy without further review. Norton isn't much better either. I had no problems until these programs created glitches.
1,A practically useless software,"Spamkiller downloaded all my e-mails from the mail server and checked the title and text of the messages for spams. This frequent process took up lot of time and it caught less than 1 percent of the spams. The update center was really annoying. I didn't pay much for the software, but it wasted my time and system time. The software was deinstalled after two weeks. I ended up using a free software 'mailwasher'. Mailwasher didn't catch most of the spams either, but it only downloaded the titles. I checked which are spams, which I need to read. The program deleted the spams on the mail server directly. The solution is not prefect but it helps. McAfee Spamkiller did nothing execept wasting time and resouces."
1,AOL,"All I can say is that it doesn't work with AOL, so if that's what you're buying it for, save your time."
5,not bad,I bought this to complete the Michael Myers mask I had bought. I bought an XL for my significant other who is 6' and about 220lbs. It fits him well and the quality of the coveralls are more than what I had expected.
1,Quality coveralls,"Short and sweet review here....................... These are very good coveralls. They are made very well and I have been looking for some to replace mine for awhile now. My old employer used to supply them and since mine were finally wearing out, I started looking for new ones. The tags in my old ones used to bother my neck (Tickling and the like) so I tore them out a long time ago and that is why I could not figure out who made them. I bought several different brands and none seemed to be the quality of my old ones. These are heavy material, but not too heavy either. After a few washes, they are just perfect. I would advise on taking some real measurements and when ordering online, let them know so they can figure the best actual size for you. : )"
3,Not bad. Not great. Certainly not exhaustive.,"This is a ""where to sleep, where to eat, where to shop, where to do outdoorsy things"" type of guide, with very little dedicated to historical and cultural contexts. You're not going to find nice long essays on the local history and culture (a la Rough Guides) and you're not going to find page after page of glossy color photographs. You will find the state completely covered, but very thinly covered, with an emphasis on outdoor activity (in a very indoor-activity rich state). To be fair to the author, Maryland may be small, but it's so packed with stuff it would be a monumental task to attempt a truly comprehensive guide. Bottom line, this one is more pragmatic than a real culture or history buff will like."
1,Read the Original,"Women who want to take charge of their lives (or anyone else) will get little out of this book. The author projects her own emotions and conflicts onto women of the Bible, extracts illogical conclusions, and wraps up the whole thing with empty, chirpy imperatives like ""deal with it!"" The author comes off as brittle rather than inspiring. Further, the book needs the help of a good editor to reduce the rambling, unfocused narrative into more cohesive text.A better way to deal with life is to read the Bible yourself for its richness and wisdom rather than heed the author's superficial conclusions, which are only ""sound bites"" posing as actual exegesis."
4,Great read I recommend we all deal with it,Pastor Paula White delivers an awesome read that offers great practical application that offers the reader the choice to move past their pasts. Those who follow her ministry will find it a more in depth explanation of the spiritual teachings and messages available through her television ministry. I recommend this as a must read for anyone who is living life after trauma especially incidents that were done against their will. Look to the words of this anointed woman of God and know that you can deal with it but you gotta confront it first. This book deserve a Silver rating because it is a great effective read.
4,It's Your Time to Live the Victorious Christian Life!,"Are there things in your life-spiritual or otherwise that are blocking your emotional, physical, relational or financial healing? Paula White writes about women in the Bible who have overcome increasing odds and equally painful situations to live out their God given destiny. You can too. Deal with it, confront and conquer and your latter shall be greater than your past. A must read for every woman, young or old who feels stuck, discouraged and weary. Truly inspiring as Paula White also weaves in testimonies from her own faith walk. Recommended.Review by The GOOD GIRL Reviewers--www.goodgirlbookclubonline.comThe GOOD GIRL Book Club (tm)"
4,A passion for passion . . .,"A very well protrayed pseudo psychoanalysis of the dynamics of obsessive love. Asylum explores the pathos of obsession by way of a female character (Stella) that falls in love with a patient in the mental institution where her husband is positioned to become the next superintendent. The film does an excellent job of exploring the ""at all cost"" behavior of the obsessed. From a lifeless marriage to a life-threatening affair, Stella ends up without love, passion or security. The destruction of her life slowly unfolds, leaving the viewer guessing what will happen next and exactly how far she will take an affair that most sane people would have realized as dangerous, partially fulfilling, at best, and extremely short-term."
3,light gone dark,The story of passion lost and passion found and passion gine horribly wrong !!! Too many twisted lives and twisted hearts
5,A must read for anyone whose lost the love of their life.,"I've read many books since my husband died. This book is at the top of the list. I found it on a shelf in a small book store while visiting relatives. Now I give it as a gift to others as the author gave it as a gift to his spouse. The messages are universal, the words are personal."
2,Think Twice,"Sorry, this toy is a hunk o' junk. Like other reviewers wrote, it's a good way (the only way?) to get the talking Roley, but the shelter itself is pathetic. Just look at it funny and the thing falls apart. Think twice before you waste your money."
2,Better suited for older kids!,"My 2 year old is obsessed with Bob. I'm sure other moms know how difficult it is to find Bob toys. Even still, steer clear of this unless your child is older. I don't know a single small child who wouldn't immediately take this toy apart. I agree with the other reviewers with regards to its' durability. It just doesn't stay put together. Probably a great toy for OLDER kids! Little ones just don't have fun with it. My son loves the Roley included! (You have to install the batteries in it for it to talk.)"
2,Not a very fun toy,"I purchased this toy so that my son could park all the Bob the builder mini vehicles I bought for him in it. He does play with it some but it doesn't do any more than a shoebox turned on it's side would. It doesn't stay put together. The ramp is placed into a space underneath the shelter but doesn't snap together, so if the shelter is moved at all it comes apart. The mountain scene that snaps on top doesn't snap in well. The Roly vehicle that came with it doesn't work. When you press the top of it down it does nothing. NOT AT ALL WORTH THE MONEY. If it closed together to form a carrying case then it would have been worthwhile"
2,Flimsy stuff,"This series is pretty lightweight. You don't feel that you've visited ancient Rome -- the city doesn't come alive, the people do not behave as we expect, e.g. Milo, Cicero, Cato, to behave. The scenary feels like cardboard, and it is hard to care about any of the people, including the 'hero' Decius.Historical detective fiction has been done a whole lot better than this. Lindsay Davies' 'Falco' novels are far better written, and much more fun to read.The funny thing is that Roberts can write a good tale when he wants to. But he seems to know nothing about ancient Rome, and it shows. I was disappointed, anyway."
3,The First SPQR,"Written in 1990, SPQR is a lightweight addition to the Roman historical novels. I read it from cover to cover, not because it advanced my knowledge of Rome, but because it was so easy. I like the writing style, but prefer books that are more gritty and less reliant on coincidences. I would have enjoyed it more if the character of Claudius Pulcher had been expanded. I want to know more about this interesting ancient Roman. This 'first-in-a-series' was a fun 3 hour read but not one I particularly want to repeat. Perfect for the high school reader but give me Maureen McCollough or Barbara Tuchman any time"
3,Not a bad Roman Romp,"Very similar to the Roman books of Steven Saylor. You'll learn a bit about ancient Rome during the rise of Ceaser but although the hidden plot is interesting and reasonable I felt that his portrayal of important persons was a little forced at times and it distracted me, but I'm looking forward to reading more of these books."
3,Roy Clark is an incredible guitar player but...,"This album is not showing his lightning speed on most songs. They should have left ""lightning"" out of the title."
2,Less than expected,"Roy Clark is one fabulous guitarist, but this album does not do him justice. There are two or three songs which are worthy of the album title. The rest are nothing special. I expected one hot tune after another, but most are nothing to get excited about and the arrangements are lacking as well. It was quite a disappointment."
5,The HeeHaw Wiz-Kid,"Yeah, there is always a treat out there if you look hard enough and ask yer elders. Does anyone out there remember Roy's numerous guest appearances on the '70 TV Sitcom, ""The Odd Couple""? He could just melt the audience with that acoustic and make you forget you were supposed to laugh at Felix and Oscar. What a gift. It's as good as finding those rare, early LP's of Glen Campbell doing nothing but picking a twelve string. Yeah....that's another treat you need to seek out! Enjoy!"
3,Feeling Cavalier,"I bought ""Feeling Cavalier"" by EBN-OZN because I had a vague memory from back in the 80s of the song ""AEIOU Sometimes Y"".So I did a search and found it, ordered it at a fair price I thought.I really enjoyed ""AEIOU Somtimes Y"" and there is another gem on it called ""Bag Lady(I Wonder)"".These two songs are a real piece of work, the other songs are just filler. Overall I am not dissapointed with my purchase"
5,A fantastic synth pop treasure!!!!!,"EBN-OZN are best known for ""AEIOU Sometimes Y"" and ""Bag Lady"", but they're lone album ""Feeling Cavalier"" is a fantastic synth pop treasure with lots of other great songs besides the two they're best known for, such as ""Stop Stop Give It Up"" (which was another single, but didn't have a video. I think it was only issued as a promo though.), Kuchenga Pamoja, Video D.J. and a crazy, but fun cover of Rockin' Robin, just to name a few. EBN died in 1998, but I don't know where OZN is now. I guess he's still involved in the film business, but he doesn't have an official site or anything. Anyway, ""Feeling Cavalier"" is an album that every 80's fan and/or synth pop fan shouldn't be without!!!!!"
5,Great American made product!,"I had purchased 2 of these for my wife's car,and couldn't believe the difference in the ride and the handling and stability! This is the way to go when replacing struts. Buy these loaded struts,so you know that everything is new. Do not just replace only the struts. Most mechanics would recommend the same. You are getting a quality product here,and the beauty of it is that it is American made.(Hard to find these days) I would recommend these to anybody,and would definitely buy them again,if need be."
3,"Great copier, so-so printer","If you can handle the toner costs, this units works well as a copier and it's very impressive at copying photographs. Sharp puts the same workings into a slightly different case and sells it to Xerox where it is retagged as a workcentre. We've had this Xerox unit at work and it has been great as a copier but we had to remove it from printer duty because it was always locking up and printing solid black pages whenever we asked it to print documents over about 3 pages long. I bought the Sharp for my home hoping the problem was fixed. Long story made short: It wasn't. I took it back and got a Brother that produces quality that is about the same but it prints faster and doesn't lock up."
2,In Albert's shadow,I loved the books I have read about Albert Einstein's life. I thought this would be just as good. But all the letters really didn't tell the story. I got through 1/2 of the letters and stopped.
1,"Old, Out-dated book","This book may have been good once, but now it is out-dated and can even be embarrassing for people to learn from and use at work. The author has written new books which I bought and like much more. They are easier to use, and include more commonly used expressions. I do not reccommend this old book."
4,The '70s,The show was nice to watch. It's a collection of music that will bring back memories to those who lived during and through the '70s. The younger folks can stop/listen and maybe appreciate what music their parents found to be hip at the time.
2,good old times,"I got this dvd hoping to see those artists that i liked from many years ago to bring memories back from old times but instead i saw aged artists that try to act like what they were 30 years younger,i was diasspointed and this dvd did not appeale to me eventhogh i still liked all those old songs"
1,Disappointing,"The photo of the product did not show the true condition of the book. The dust jacket was pretty ragged, and the book underneath seems to be water damaged.The ease of ordering and shipping was good, however, and I love the contents of this book. I've used it with my fifth grade students for years and years.I recently ordered another one in newer condition and am very satisfied with it."
5,Awesome!,"I had never heard of this movie until a friend introduced it to me and I fell in love! The cutest thing, and it definitely worked well."
2,you will do well; trust me.,"If you are reading this review, you don't need this book. You already have what it offers-motivation. If you care enough about the SAT to read reviews of the best practice books, you will do well; trust me. This book is for students who need a push to prepare. While not a bad book for its purpose, it spends too much time motivating, and not enough time teaching. There are relatively few practice exercises, and the answers are too basic for motivated students. Instead, I recommend buying Cracking the New SAT 2005 from the Princeton Review. It has three complete tests, and the main text provides excellent strategies for attacking questions in math, verbal and writing. With time and practice, you will definitely do very well on the SAT."
3,Helped some,"If I had studied this book like I should have, it would have helped a lot more than it did. It's a really good guide. I do recommened it."
4,"Interesting..., and a Good Value.","I found this book laying around in the library and decided to pick it up, even though it's outdated, I still thought it would give tips for the reading and math sections. It did that and in addition, it made some good jokes worthy of a real laugh. A quick and enjoyable read, it may not be for people who really wanna get serious and straight into studying the SAT. If you want to use your time to the best of your advantage, you should just go ahead and do SAT problems on your own, but this book is basically the talk part of it (it instructs you to practice on your own using a book written by the collegeboard). Nonetheless, i still had a good time reading this book and i liked it, so read it at on your own time and at your own risk. It does include a good 600 word vocab section that suggests how to remember each individual word, and I found that pretty valuable since a side vocabulary book would cost around the same price."
5,This book rocks!,"This book got my score from a 1420 to a 1510, and my verbal alone went up 70 points! the vocab section is particularly good, and the section on Guessing is unique for a this type of book, although helpful.. plus it's really funny! i highly recommend!"
2,Not what I expected...,"While the story behind why the author lost the weight was inspirational, I was disappointed to find out how small this book was. It also seemed as if there was not an editor for this book. There were many grammatical errors. I felt like the book was thrown together in a very short period of time. In my opinion, it was not worth what I paid."
2,Fiennes Sleep Walks,through this movie. Not much to recomend here. The girl is attractive and Liota adds a little spark to a mundane movie. But Fiennes seems to lack the charisma or the intensity to carrey off this role. I disagree with the other reviews which state that he is the only reason to watch this movie. I feel Liota is starting to grow as as actor. He seems to be adding a little bit more to his charcter; instead of acting like he is in a complete rage. I hope he gets better parts and continue to grow. I enjoy a good mystery; they seem to be few and far between. I feel the writing of script's has been below par for years. This is a movie that needed a good script. It is not a all out action movie; once again the writing does not measure up. And those who like a good mystery are left wanting and wondering when they will be treated to a good movie of this type.
3,Fiennes and Mol Light Up the Screen,"I watched Forever Mine last night and thought it was a pretty decent essay of an extramarital affair. We begin in the 1970's where Alan (Fiennes) is working at a swank hotel as a cabana boy. When he sees Ella, played by Mol, he falls instantly in love with her. The problem is she's married to a lowlife businessman (Ray Liotta, in full scumbag mode). They begin an affair which results in Alan getting disfigured from Liotta's goons and left for dead. Now it's 1987 and Alan is returning for revenge.The dialogue is very cliche heavy, with dreamy declarations of love between Ella and Alan. But I thought that Fiennes and Mol were believable as the doomed duo. Liotta has got to stop playing the heavy. After seeing Heartbreakers and Blow, I know he's an amazing actor who can do so much more."
4,One of the better love stories,"At night I will flip through the channels and set theTV timer for 30 minutes because I know I will fall asleep. When I found this movie, I set the timer and then cancelled it. I watched it all the way through. It wasn't over until 2:30 and I knew I had to go to work the next morning but couldn't quit watching it. I enjoyed this movie very much even though I didn't care too much for the end."
1,Really really boring - yuk!,"Ray Liotta has been in some bad movies, but this one ranks right up there among the very worst. Some reviewers enjoyed the love story, but these two would-be star-crossed lovers were incredibly unappealing to me and dull. This film didn't work for me on either level - boring love story or boring revenge story. I usually enjoy even the bad Ray Liotta movies because he can be so delightfully crazy, but he isn't quite crazy enough in this one even though he's the bad guy (he does make an attempt toward the end to come through, but it's too late by then - anybody who has stuck with the movie this far, doesn't really care by now.). If you really want a star-crossed lover's tale, surely you can dig up something more exciting than this one; and there are definitely better revenge plots out there than this one. I wanted to smack Alan and Ella by the end of the movie for being such sappy idiots. They deserve each other."
4,Fiennes-esque,"Can it get anymore passionate than Joseph Fiennes? I don't think so. Interesting plot and believeable characters abound this intense romance with Gretchen Mole. Great twisty climax although the ending kinda left me bewildered. Dark and deep at points, but its worth it to see Joe in cabana shorts and shirt. Fun, fun, fun."
2,Forever Mine,I love this movie but there is a problem with it. The sound and video do not match up.....it is off-sync which makes it hard to watch.
4,great family film!,I loved it! Awesome characters and story line as well as a well rounded score. It was intellectually intriguing and fun. Highly recommended for all ages!
3,"Exciting, but than stupid",This film was very exciting with Holmes as a youth uncovering an old civilization that are killing people by making them see things that aren't there with darts fired from a blow gun. There are some very stupid parts in it but it was pretty good.
2,I don't like fantasy in my Sherlock,"Just recently the nerds on one of my favorite television shows ""The Big Bang Theory"" mentioned enjoying this movie. I remembered enjoying it when it first came out. And especially liking the teaser at the end of the credits which most of the audience missed as they had left the theatre. But re-watching this was a big disappointment. First of all the special effects take up way to much time in the movie that could have been given to establishing a better story line. The idea of Sherlock and Watson being together in school long before the ""Study in Scarlet"" is distasteful. The actor playing Holmes was badly cast. And the sensational ending is just too out of step with the real mood of the Holmes stories.The only thing really good about this is that it may have inspired the idea for Harry Potter."
2,Far fetched story line,"I have realized that every spin off of Sherlock Holmes disappoints me greatly (I am an ardent fan of the BBC series with Jeremy Brett as Holmes).I do not intend to spoil the plot and hence I shall write no more about the mystery.On the bright side, they have tried hard to do justice to Sherlock Holmes whimpsies, e.g, fencing, the hat, existence of Mycroft et al.This one simply adds to my big fat collection of Sherlock Holmes DVDs. I wont dispose of it, but I wont be watching it for the second time either."
2,"Great production values, but weak casting!","Why anybody would want to make a movie about Sherlock Holmes & Dr. Watson as teenagers is beyond me, but I don't think this one was very successful. The story line was weak and unbelieveable, and I didn't like the main protagonists at all!"
5,"Attacked by pastries, what a way to go","I saw this film in the theatre when it was released; it was one of the very first films to use CGI. Watching it again gave me a nostalgic pleasure, even if the effects look terribly dated in spots. Holmes fans should give it a go, as it really is entertaining and clever."
4,A 'What If' Story ...,"This is one of the very few non cannon Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson movies I like out there. I found it very imaginative and a good beginning for kids. This is a more what could have happened, if John and Sherlock had meat each other in their younger years."
1,skip it,"very little to do with and entirely unlike anything genuinely holmesian. just a bad, rambling often incoherent production with ghoulish effects in place of genuine invention. pass."
3,Light entertainment,"This movie is moderately entertaining but doesn't really add anything to the genre. Some good plot twists, a rather fantastic conclusion. OK not great."
5,"Entertaining - from the first time I saw it, to the latest","Even if the plot is a bit outrageous, it is still a pleasure to watch. Nicholas Rowe is well cast as the young Sherlock. The picture was nominated for an Oscar for visual effects - the ""knight"" was a ground-breaking technique from ILM - Industrial Light & Magic.And I like the fact that the movie 'rewards' viewers who stay through the end credits. If you rush to leave ....you lose."
3,fun little homage,"not the best Sherlock Holmes out there, not with the BBC Sherlock, or Robert Downey Jr's or even Elementary, but it's a fun little homage 1980's movie to Sherlock Holmes"
1,What...the...Hades...,"Fan of Sherlock Holmes (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as well as current BBC version). Poor movie if you're looking for anything remotely resembling ""Sherlock Holmes""; amazing if you're interested in a ""Mystery Science Theater"" type film.We watched it with Amazon Prime, so it was ""free."" Definitely NOT worth renting or buying.P.S. Let's go Pens!"
5,What a great movie,our family just loves this movie. I don't know why it was not a blockbuster. It has a wonderfully storyline and some nice special effects.I think anyone above eight to eighty would like this film
2,Even Spielberg!,"Even the greats have bad days, maybe bad seasons, during which the filming of a movie takes place. This particular movie veers away from the canon and everything it presents to such an extent that if the darker stuff like ritual killings and death of teenagers are taken away, this movie almost becomes a spoof of Sherlock Holmes. Probably Spielberg had simply offloaded some Indiana Jones material in this movie by giving us a mushy Holmes, an irritating Watson, and some of the most OTT villains which can be produced only in Hollywood.If you are not in the mood for the original stuff, as portrayed inThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Boxed Set Collection)or the latest ""reboot"" (Sherlock Holmes) or even its more intelligent ""updating"" (Sherlock: Season One), and simply wish to have fun, better pursueThe Great Mouse Detective (Mystery in the Mist Edition), which, let me assure you, is vastly superior to this particular movie that is under review."
4,Spielberg Does Holmes & I Proclaim It Good,"This nifty movie is sooooo Spielberg. In fact, it is more Temple of Doom than Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, but that's okay because the results are terrific. Barry Levinson cranks up the juice as Nicholas Rowe (as great a Holmes as Jeremy Brett) and Watson (Alan Cox doing a Nigel Bruce, foot in bucket and all) team up in a wonderfully atmospheric boarding school and fight computer generated bad things. Holmes falls in love with an English beauty, and not to give too much away, he loses her (gotcha), thus beginning his famous lonely path. There is so much to like ... especially for any Anglophiles. The gothic and the Victorian, the Spielbergian excitement, and a slick production with a lot of heart. And that's what really marked the best Spielberg-produced movies ... a lot of heart."
4,a fun romp for lovers of Holmes,"This movie has been a favorite of mine for years. Watching Sherlock and John become friends and make their way through not only the mystery and loss involved, but also through the rigors of being teen outcasts at school gives a very human face to the staunch detective."
4,One of my guilty pleasures,"I loved this movie when it came out, and I still enjoy it today. Cleaver story-line and character interpretation, great acting, and just plain fun."
5,One of My Favorite Movies,Had to finally replace my old VHS copy when my VHS player died....wasn't ready to be without this GREAT movie.
1,Misleading/Fraudulent Listing,"The title for this item is ""Case of 24"" 100-watt incandescent light bulbs, with the price listed as $1.99. Seemed too good to be true, and, sure enough, went to the linked external vendor's site, and that price is per bulb. The case of 24 is priced at $47.76/case. No problem with their pricing, just with the misleading item listing."
1,I was disappointed,I had purchased this expecting a chemistry tutorial. It is actually just a bunch of test questions. There is no intial instruction. It is not what I was looking for.
3,"Inspiring, but...","As others have mentioned here, there were no before/after pictures, which really would have helped.The summaries about each person were very brief and over-simplified. Each focuses on one ""tip"" that ""helped them lose x pounds"" but it makes it sound like that's the only thing they did to lose the weight. For instance, one person lost weight by following a strict diet during the week and then eating anything she wanted on the weekend...there has to be much more to the story..no one can lose weight this way. There were a lot of stories such as that one."
2,Wish I had checked it out from the library...,"I was very excited about ordering this book and immediately started reading it upon its arrival. However, several pages into my reading my ""excitement"" turned to disappointment. Not only are there no pictures (I always find before and after pictures so motivating!), but the stories were much shorter than I expected. The 145 ""secrets"" (which the author will comment on after each one page story!) were many that we've all heard before. Eat more veggies, exercise,set goals, etc. I found the Oprah show that mentioned the book much more motivating than the book."
4,I will read this over and over!,"Over the last several years, I have kept stories of those who have lost a lot of weight in a healthy manner to give me inspiration in dealing with my own struggles. Now I don't have to! There are 145 short (1-2 page) stories told by people who have lost from 10 to 200+ pounds and how their lives have changed. This book's tone is that it's about wanting a healthier you over the long term and not about a quick fix. I loved the book, but only gave it 4 stars because I think that each of the stories could have been a little longer and maybe have included before and after pictures to really make the points hit home."
3,No earth-shattering news,"As a dedicated reader of Prevention magazine, I thought this book by the magazine's editor would be truly inspiring. However, I was disappointed that much of the book had already appeared in the magazine itself in summary. Many of the ideas mentioned were not new to me, and I wasn't motivated by the book much at all."
3,Okay for Motivation,"After all the hype, I thought I'd check this out and it's okay for motivation. I still haven't found a weight-loss author who surpasses Gary Rempe. I've lost AND KEPT OFF a lot of weight with his book."
3,Overkill,I can't fault the content - it's very thorough and fairly readable - but I simply don't find myself reaching for it on my office bookshelf. If I need marketing guides or ideas I find myself just Googling it.Ie. Comprehensive but unwieldy.
3,Excellent but..,"This is an excellent book. I didn't realize that the pricing was in Euros, but other than that it is a great book."
2,"read, used, successful","As a teacher in an affluent school that demands competent and creative teachers, I am always looking for new ways to engage my students and help them to develop critical thinking skills and a love for education. Having read the four book series and having instituted the ideas into practice, I can say it has made me a better teacher and has enlivened my classroom. Although it is true that the book lacks any scientific data to back its assertions, so it is with most books on education. Education is a difficult concept to scientifically quantify, and first one would have to answer the question...What is education? That notwithstanding, this book helps in all areas of teaching from the teaching of intelligent, curious students to less inspired and motivated student to those who have been mainstreamed into the classroom. It helps develop a ""whole"" classroom that benefits each and every child."
4,Habits of Mind,"The series of books are interesting reading. Many good ideas, but tough to implement as an individual. These would be good books to use for a Professional Learning Circle or professional development."
2,Habits of Mind,"The description stated that there was some highlighting. Actually, there was quite a bit of underlining in the book. Had I known the extent, I would not have purchased it. But, I am glad that I have the book."
1,"ZERO STARS. Completely useless, hazardous and idiotic.","This is a pathetic piece of compressed sewage.Maybe back in the mid 1990s it was funny, ha-ha, but it is not any more. Not since 9/11 anyway. Anybody reading this book stupid enough to follow any of its suggestions is likely to either blow their own head off or end up in jail on terrorism charges.It has nothing to do with a sense of humor, it has to do with having more than one brain cell in your head in operating condition. A far more practical book than this one would be any one of the numerous texts available on the captivating field of animal husbandry."
1,"A stupid, dangerous book","This book is full of some exceedingly bad information that can easily result in serious personal injury. As a one-time professional pyrotechnician, I shuddered at some of the recommendations in the book. The reader following some of the plans in this book is almost guarenteed serious personal injury and the possibility of being charged with violation of various Federal laws and regulations"
2,Not to be Taken Seriously,"I like model and high power rocketry. This book, though, is not for those with similar interests. It is for those who would like to learn how, theoretically, such rockets could be made into improvised weapons. There are not particularly good or accurate weapons, they have the form rather than the functionality of the real thing.It is interesting in a curious way. The ideas put forth are certainly correct in their conception. The details are all very fuzzy, however. This is probably for the best. Most of what is contained in here is DEFINITELY NOT SAFE. The author says as much.I wouldn't take this very seriously. I'm rather sorry I took it at all."
4,Great price and great taste,This dressing is priced a lot higher in the supermarkets in our area. We've tried a lot of balsamic vinaigrettes but prefer this one. Nothing exotic but it works for us. Kudos to Amazon for including it in their subscribe & save offerings.
3,"Good, but Lacking","I found this DVD interesting, but not what I was looking for. I grew up in Detroit and wanted more information on the whole area. This DVD did not provide it."
4,The real story of Detroit,"Detroit is an important study for all cities in North America - what happened there can happen anywhere. The movie clearly shows the results of decades of systemic racism combined with unrestrained capitalist ideals and corruption at all levels. It is so sad to see such waste.But there is more to Detroit than is shown in this movie, and that is why I haven't given it 5 stars. There are tremendous cultural and artistic resources that provide a counterpoint to the decay. This is a much better movie than Detropia if you want to understand what lead to Detroit's current state, but it paints too bleak a picture. Watch the movie, then go to Detroit and see for yourself."
1,"Ha, ha, ha. * sarcasm *","As other reviewers before have noted (and others will note), this book is being listed under Amazon's ""recommended instead of"" feature for albums from bands such as Slayer, Pantera, Damageplan, Black Sabbath, Alice Cooper, et cetera. This is getting quite old. Why is this spamming going on? If Christianity is about loving people, then why are some people (or should I say some person) being so close-minded and judgemental?Seriously, whoever's behind this, knock it off. Please leave me and my ""devil music"" alone!"
3,So Sad,"You know what's pathetic? That this may actually be an alright book to read - the premise of it sounds interesting enough. Too bad all it's done is make me wonder if Kurt Kobain would be writing as nice of a review here as I am considering it's taken my time away from his sweet box set. I know for a fact David Grohl and Courtney Love would be pretty pissed; they need the money, you know? Anyway, point being, I don't know if I should blame zealots or retards (one and the same?) here, but I do find it very sad that Normis has such a bad rating based in people that never even read the book."
1,I want five minutes of my life back,"I just so happen to be a satanic metaller, and the link to this book as a suggestion instead of Isis' Panopticon album took five minutes out of my time (both to read the description and write this review) which would have otherwise been spent drinking goat's blood or offering alms to Ra. Only satanic metallers would write a review for a book they've never read, right? Well, only idiotic Amazon.com shoppers (who just so happen to be Christian) with absolutely no marketing or PR sense would think that suggesting this book instead of an album with absolutely no relationship to said book would think that anyone duped into viewing the page for this book would actually want to pick it up for any reason other than to use it for its full potential as 260 pages of quality toilet paper!"
1,I'm a Red Sox Fan,"For goodness sake - I wasn't even looking at metal bands. I was looking at the Red Sox. I don't care if you have a vendetta against heavy metal, which is pretty stupid if you do. But how could you recommend this over the most historic win in baseball? Avowed Christian Curt Schilling would be disappointed, as am I, also a Christian."
1,The Last Street Fighter,"Killswitch Engage. Slayer. Black Sabbath. Mercyful Fate. Meshuggah. In Flames. Fear Factory. Unearth. Shadows Fall. Guns And Roses. As I Lay Dying. Metallica. Iron Maiden. Arch Enemy. Satyricon. Chevelle. Each and every one of these bands has had ""The Last Street Fighter"" recommended instead of their albums, and Im sure there are many more. Christians, stop doing that. Im not going to convert. In fact, I think from now on for every CD I see with this book recommended instead of it, Im going to write another 1 star review."
1,THIS IS BS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"do not get this book, get everything that this book is against!!! (ie Black Sabbath, Slayer, classic rock). those religious fanatics WILL NOT WIN!!! get these albums instead of this spamming book.SLAYERPINK FLOYDROLLING STONESMEGADETHMETALLICAetc, etc....."
1,I have an idea: Let's have an online vote!,"If you are gonna recommend this book instead for metal albums, vote 'not helpful'.If you, like me, say all these freaking chrsitians are spamming up the amazon website by these recommendations and believe they should stop, vote 'helpful'.If I see another recommendation of this book instead of an album, i'll recommend 'Scars of the crucifix' by Deicide instead of the bible."
1,Keep looking --- elsewhere.,"Out-of-stock??? Don't be sad, be glad!I read the book (I found it at the dump) and was left feeling quite flat. Here's the problem: this book probably never had any potential, though an excellent writer may have forced a little anyway. Sadly, Ms. Thomas reinforces throughout her book that --- and so it was --- she can't write."
2,If size does matter...,"Then first of all its small. That is, its smaller in size than the average design book. (24X19 cm). I don't know what I was hoping to find there but looking at stills from a work that is very much time and movement oriented seems awkward especially when these breathtaking Film titles are easily found on IF's web site. (imaginaryforces.com) So what is there in the book after all? A nice summery of the (short) history of Title design. Commentary about coopers work. Some nice drafts and sketches for works. (Seven - Coopers most revered work appears in the book only in sketches) Note that they were drawn by storyboard artist and not by cooper.Kyle cooper a genius of his art deserves much appreciation but if this book does it, well, you be the judge.As a regular graphic design reference book, any David Carson or such would be better."
3,Kyle cooper book,"this book was very good in informing about Cooper however i wish someone would produce a more in depth look at him as this is the only book about him and research needs depth, the book is good but could be soo much more and there need to be more like it"
5,Great Book,"Excellent book for any level of player looking to learn Irish style mandolin. For complete beginners, it features a very well written intro to holding the instrument, tuning, basic scales, etc. that are as good a beginners guide as I have seen. Then the book starts on songs, staring with some slow airs and basic polkas, then gradually getting more difficult. The songs are a very well chosen progression. The songs are broken up with tips about practicing, embelishment/improvisation etc. Complete beginners will find a great mandolin method, intermediate players can skip to the tunes and improve their playing bit by bit, and more advanced players will find a nice collection of Irish tunes for the Mandolin. Very highly recommended."
4,This is too weird...,"After I took a look at the songs on the CD, I thought to myself, ""Dang ! It's soooo close."" It's missing ""Sailing Without any Sails"" and ""25 Words or Less"" from the Michael Johnson Album. Then, I look at the reviews section and find very similar comments from a couple of other reviewers. Glad to see I'm not the only one who would like a shot at a CD version of that great album. If it's not on Amazon, I'm not sure there's much hope in finding it anywhere :-("
3,Get it to hear his early work,"Johnson's country efforts hold no interest for me. But his rendition of ""Almost Like Being In Love"" is a must hear."
2,"Can't be ""The Best"" without...","...""Empty Hearts"" -- one of the greatest guitar/vocal pieces ever recorded. Not to mention (but I will anyway) anything from ""There Is A Breeze"" including the title track, or his take on Jackson Browne's ""There's a Train..."" or Greg Brown's ""Rooty Toot Toot For The Moon"".Just too many good, obvious choices missing, and too much Nashville factory music include to be a good sampling from a guy who started out recording with MN greats like Kottke..."
2,"Release ""The Michael Johnson Album"" on CD!!","Would someone please just reissue ""The Michael Johnson Album"" on CD or in MP3 format, in it's entirety, in domestic form. It is his greatest piece of work ever. It is so ridiculous that so many great albums never make it to CD in the U.S.A."
1,WISH IT WAS THE ORIGINAL B than B,"Used to listen to Micheal here in the Twin Cities at some of the local clubs when I was attending the U.of M.in the late 60's and early 70's. Sadly, all my old tapes and records are shot. Wish I could get a c.d. of the original B than B, and For All You Mad Musicians.Still attend his concerts at Northrup at the U. Any one have access to any of his old stuff?"
5,Active form of vitamin B6,"This is the active form of vitamin B6. Multiple vitamins and ""mega b vitamin"" formulas rely on your body to convert the inactive forms to this form before your body can use it. Some people do better with the active form. For instance, I can take the active form in large doses, but even 50 mg of the inactive forms give me a headache."
5,THE TRUE HISTORY OF OUR WORLD,"The most powerful, cohesive summary of world history I have ever read. Supported by incredible research (500+++ footnotes per chapter). Marilyn French has formed a work of such astonishing clarity and vision that I am at a loss as to how describe it. Buy it, read it, and LEARN!"
5,Perfect highighter,"I bought these as gifts for monastic friends so they can highlight the liturgical texts they are studying. They love them. The yellow underlines the pencil makes is bright and strong enough to pull the eye to where they need to focus, without being too intrusive. And the eraser allows them to undo. They'd love more!"
1,"Misleading advertising, buyer beware","The ad is for 1 pencil, not 1 box of 12 pencils. The description is not specific of the quantity.Way overpriced."
5,Only place I could fine yellow pencils,Only place I could fine yellow pencils. After checking all the office supply store and local department stores I tried Amazon where I found just what I want at a price that I would pay. What can you say about a pencil. these yellow pencils do what they are design to do. I use them to check drawings with and have found them to be very good. The eraser is a bonus when ever I mark something that should not be marked.
4,"Excellent color pencil, the bar code sticker isn't as bad as made out to be","This is a great color pencil. The lead is firm enough that it doesn't splinter or break excessively and it erases adequately although it does leave a trace behind. Please note that if you're looking for a deep red that really jumps off the page when underlining you may want to go with a pencil that's not erasable. Also to address the issue many other reviewer have about the bar code label that's on the pencils, I didn't have an issue with removing it and I was able to get the adhesive residue on the pencil rubbed off just by using my thumb."
3,They don't erase as well as they should,"Prismacolor pencils are always awesome and vivid, but these just don't erase well at all. They lighten in color, but don't disappear as they should. I probably wouldn't bother with these again."
1,junk!,I use red pencils everyday and when you sharpen these pencils the tips break off when writing therefore you must sharpen again. This goes on until there's no pencil left to sharpen. 1 dozen pencils turned to dust.
3,This is a red Pencil,These pencils are pretty good. They are red and they come in a box. The only problem was that it took about two weeks to get to me. Besides that it is a good pencil.
1,False advertising!,This better be a good pencil because you're paying nearly $5 for 1. There is no verbiage that says this - buyer beware!
3,problematic for neat freaks,"The pencils themselves are just fine, but I did not anticipate that they would arrive with large barcode stickers wrapped around the eraser end of each and every pencil. If you are the sort of person who enjoys ordering red pencils in bulk (read: a little neurotic), you might find this a little offputting. Be warned."
1,Only one pencil - go elsewhere.,"I got 2 pencils for $10!!!I returned them, and bought 12 for $7 elsewhere.What a joke! 0 stars."
1,Buyer Beware,"Whoever is selling these places a misleading picture of an entire box of the Prismacolor pencils. It is only one pencil, and you are being charged $5 for it. DO NOT BUY!"
1,They don't erase,"I would give them more stars because everthing else is great, but when your name is Col-Erase you better erase."
1,BIG FAT BAR CODE LABEL ON every pencil in the box.,There's a big...at least an inch long...wrapped all the way around....bar code label on every pencil in the box!!! And it's not easily removable and leaves sticky residue behind.What a STUPID thing to do.I guess I'm just labeled out in this world we live in now.....labels EVERYWHERE...non removable....with stupid warnings and ads and....OK I'll stop.But just wanted to let others know....these beautiful pencils are RUINED by the label.....on every single pencil in the box.....I know I'm starting to repeat myself......stick a fork in me...I'm done :o)
2,Too huge,"I will never buy this map again: it is huge, thin paper, you can never fold it back properly again. It is just waaaay too big: too big if you walk, too big if you drive. And besides these two what else can you use it for?.. No, thanks."
4,A book for the serious student,"Let's Dance is a fairly comprehensive step by step instruction book best for those with some dance lesson experience. Although the footwork diagrams are a little confusing, the narrative and the pictures help to bring it together. The book itself is well designed in the coffee-table style with excellent photography.Another reviewer mentioned that swing is not mentioned anywhere in the book. Swing is actually part of the chapter on jive and I found it very helpful."
3,Can't learn how to dance from this book.,"It's a good reference book if you know how to dance. If you're a beginner and try to learn from this book, you're in deep trouble. Unless you can translate ""move you left foot to left, reflex your right knee, shift your weight on to the left on beat 3"" description into movement right away, you'll go through one basic movement in hours. If you want to improve your dance skill, it may be helpful. Since I'm a total beginner, I can't say that for sure."
1,Disapointed,"DisappointedIt looked like a very easy reading book, and it turned out to be a very confusing bunch of steps and pictures. And by the way, I have asked my swing instructor about the steps and he had found some mistakes."
1,BEAUTIFUL BOO K - ALMOST USELESS INFORMATION,"BEWARE: This book describes the International Style of ballroom dance. NOT the American style. Perhaps 10% of American dance students are learning International.EXAMPLE: THE WALTZAmerican Waltz:The basic figure is a square in which the man starts by stepping forward with the left foot and the dancers return to the starting position in 6 beats, making a square.International Waltz:The basic figure is a zig-zag. The man starts with the RIGHT foot and the dancers travel around the dance floor in a zig-zag pattern.It would be great if Paul Bottomer would write a similar beautiful book for American ballroom dancers.Dave Palmer"
4,so far so good,"The headphones are very good, pretty big for my 10 years old daughter but she is happy with them. So far So good"
4,It's NOT that bad!,"I have been kind of surprised with the real negative reviews of this movie. I have seen much much worst. I am glad I rented this movie because I actually enjoyed it. Yes, there is a lot in this movie that makes absolutely no sense but I found the atmosphere to be quite creepy and I thought it was good for a B horror movie especially with some of the other stuff that has been released lately. I was not bored watching this movie and felt like it moved along at a pretty good pace which is important for me- I hate when you watch a movie for 80 min and it seems like 3 hours. I would give this 3 stars but it doesn't deserve just a star so I am giving it an extra star for that reason. Rent it and give it a chance."
1,The WORST of Everything...,"....the script had to have been written by a third grader, the acting is worse than anything I have ever seen....I could go on and on.Don't waste your time on this....'nuff said."
2,what???,"It might had something to do with me being intoxicated when me and my fiance watched the movie, but this is not a good one. i am a sucker for horror movies but at the end of this movie i was confused and dissapointed. like the other review...the beginning was ok. i actually thought it started pretty cool but then it got worse each minute.the acting was pretty bad and the dialogues didnt go very far. and at times i really didnt know what was going on. save yourself the trouble. anything but this.:-)"
1,CAN I GET A REFUND,"I WOULD GIVE THIS MOVIE ""0"" STARS, ONE OF THE WORST SO CALL HORROR MOVIES I'VE EVER VIEWED, THE ENDING WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING, MUCH OF IT DID NOT MAKE SENSE, WHO WAS THE WEIRD PRIEST OR MONK OR WHATEVER HE WAS? WHO WAS THE PREGNANT WOMAN TIED TO THE BED? THIS MOVIE COMPLETELY LOST ME. I'M STILL MAD."
2,i've seen worse,"a fat guy chases two young girls (one very hot) around a castle in the califorina desert. how bad can that be? actually pretty bad but the girls keep things somewhat interesting and there's some gore and a few laughs along the way. the movie never really tries to make any sense but for some reason with this one that didn't bother me at all. as redbox rentals go, i've seen worse. how's that for a recommendation."
5,My absolute favorite.....!,"There is not much more to say. I honestly love this Creamy Italian salad dressing more than any other that I have ever had.Years ago, it made it easy to go on a diet when I knew I could look forward to eating salad with this dressing. I eat others...but this is the one that I eat on a daily basis...and crave. My whole extended family likes it as well.When my local food store stopped carrying all of the fat free brands, I found it here on Amazon and I had boxes regularly shipped to my house. Recently, it seems to have gone out of stock and I am hoping they get it back. Otherwise, I'll need to find it somewhere else....sigh. (And Amazon is my favorite and most reliable place to shop)."
1,Low Fat does NOT equal Low CARB,This dressing has 12g of carbs per serving; many times more than regular dressing. This is NOT a low carb food. Low fat and low carb are not the same thing.The seller should remove this from the low carb category.
1,No Thanks!,"I eat the zesty italian all the time and decided to try this...yuck!did not taste as I thought it would...It had a sickening sweet taste...Now I am stuck with 5 bottles, no one in my family likes it, so now it goes to the food shelter..."
4,Worked fine....,These items worked fine for the purpose intended and the price was okay. They were delivered quickly and I would probably purchase this item again....
4,Good Start,"This is a really great book and it has a good basis for what a new learner of the language would need, especially someone who is planning on traveling to the Philippines. The only thing that I have a hard time with is how fast they speak on the CDs, but that does make it more like it would be like in a real life situation."
4,Helpful!!,I dont why people gave it such bad reviews. Evidently you cannot learn one language with just one book!!I like the way the author use a story line of an American family who just arrival to the Philippines. It also has writing exercises to make sure that you are learning the materials. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because I did not get the cds.I truly enjoy learning tagalog with this book.
1,Wrong wrong wrong,May be a good book but this ISBN is not shipped with cd's as stated here and the shipped copy was published in 2003.McGraw-Hill sent me an email saying that this ISBN is shipped with two cd's and cost $24.95 which is what Amazon says is the retail price.I recommend you buy from McGraw and get the cd's.
1,Very Dissappointing,"The authors didn't even know the difference between Jesse Livermore & Edwin Lefevre. In the bio about Edwin Lefevre, the authors simple pull segments from Reminiscences of A Stock Operator to describe Lefevre's life - They thought he was the main character in the book!! They write, ""Edwin Lefevre was a self-styled Stock Operator from the early 1900s, who had been in the speculative game since he was 14"".The authors didn't even know that Lefevre was a writer (an author of more than 1/2 a dozen books) & that Reminiscences was about Jesse Livermore.The above gives you an idea about how well this book was researched!Save your money!"
5,I Do: A Celebration of Love in Four Inspirational Novellas,"I highly recommend this book to any reader who loves inspirational romances! Each story combines romance, love, relationships and Christian faith. ""Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Peace"" by Veda Boyd Jones conquers love at first sight and its consequences. In Sally Laity's ""Once Upon a Dream"" the fact that love is not just for the young is dealt with elegantly. ""Something Old, Something New"" by Yvonne Lehman proves that matchmakers know a thing about love. Louree Lough's ""Wrong Church, Wrong Wedding"" shows that accidents are not always bad. Each of these stories are great, but ""Speak Now.."" and ""Wrong Church..."" are my favorites! Read this book now!"

1,Mediocre at best.,"These openers work ok at best! If you have anything like ""Homelink"" in your vehicle, these remotes will not let you program it;They don't stay 'on' long enough. It also takes 2 or more press' of the button to open your garage door, and even then it still takes forever to open. I know it is not my garage door because any other device I use to open it with works immediately.It was bot very easy to program. The only nice thing is the compact size."
1,it is not working,"This item is not working as it described. By the way, it's no customer service available to help. I don't trust this product."
2,Can't program itself based on another transmitter,"I was hoping this thing would just be able to pick up the signal from another transmitter and learn it (like a universal VCR remote). Since I live in an apartment building I don't have access to the garage door base station, and the remotes we have don't have the security codes written on them (and, upon opening them up, don't have DIP switches). I suppose it would work if you did have access to your base station or you knew your security codes. In my case, I had neither."
1,Did not Work with Lift Master,"I spent hours on December 30, trying to get this to work with my Lift MasterIt would not work. Then I went to return it and it was too late I will still try..."
1,Did not work,I received this item and it took me quite some time to configure it. The problem was it was not working. At least another person I know has the same remote for the same garage openener so it is not a compatibility issue. Terribly dissapointed.
1,Does not work with newer Craftsman Garage Door Openers,"I bought 2 of the Skylink 69P Universal Remotes for my 2010 Craftsman Garage Door Opener, but I tried to program them with no success. I went on the Skylink website with hopes of some help. This unit is not programable to newer units. and not ones on 315 MHz. If you have a newer unit than 2002 past this by."
3,"It works with Genie intellicode, 1 second delay response time.","This remote was shipped and received within 2-3 days, pretty fast. The instructions look complicated but getting set up was pretty easy. For our year 2000 Genie intellicode garage door opener. At first, we thought it does not work, nothing happened as we kept on pressing the button, then we realized it takes about a second for it to respond, unlike all other remote controls which open garage door instantly, this one has a one second delay. You press the button, wait, and it works. Coming home tonight, I pressed the remote about 50 feet away around the corner from garage, through columns, walls, by the time I see the door, it is opening. It works, the distance is very good too, the 1 second delay is annoying but we will get used to it, not a big deal, and it is $20 cheaper than Genie remote($14 including freight)."
2,Horrible range!,This item does work and open my garage door (that's why it gets 2 stars) but I have to be standing next to my garage for it to work! I have other openers that can open my garage from 2 houses down on the street yet can't be more then 15 feet away! Would not recommend this opener.
1,Unacceptable,"This is advertised as 'Universal' And says there are only THREE simple steps, however each step has sub categories and long drawn out directions. You have to disassemble the whole thing as well as take apart either the garage door opener or an existing opener to locate settings. I have worked on this off and on for days and days. Still not working. I emailed the company and the email address was disabled. Going to try one last time and call during business hours. Such a huge hassle, i would never recommend this product. - Update, they have been trying to work with me to get it working, no success. Now they say I need to purchase another one that costs more. Dont think I will. Update.... Do not purchase this, you will regret it!"
2,Stopped working,"A bit difficult to figure out how to get it keyed right to fit my garage, and it sometimes doesn't work to open the garage on the first button press or two (that's probably a function of range, I haven't really tested the range). But all in all, a good value and I'd buy one again if I needed another replacement.EDIT - I recently just replaced this with another universal remote for similar price (from Chamberlain, which has been better). This one never had good range and eventually just stopped working altogether"
2,short lived,These remote seems to have a life of about six months. I don't think I will purchase any more of the Skylink products.
1,"Didn't work at all, Had to send it back Customer Service Bad","The remote was set up exactly as instructed, and as other users articulated, we couldn't get it to work. The ""customer service' dept. was pretty much worthless."
1,too hard,This item is to complicated for the times. There are so many simpler items around the same price that work allot easier.
4,Great little remote,"There is some delay between pressing the button and the garage door opening/closing, but it's great just to have a small reliable opener!"
1,"Difficult to program, doesn't work on Craftsman openers",This remote is difficult to program (you have to work to pry the casing off) and it doesn't work on Craftsman door openers.
1,"Case is not good, fragile","The good: it works fine and it's small.The bad: the plastic case is so hard that there's no way to open it without causing cracks in the plastic. I've bought two of them and both were the same. You open it, you damage it. My first one didn't last long either, maybe about a year.Pretty disappointing. I'll look for something else next time."
2,Universal garage door opener,"Several years ago we purchased two universal garage door openers that looked identical to these. The first ones were simple to install...simply match the code on the door opener and you were in business. Needing a way to get into our elderly parents home in a emergency, we bought two more to carry in the car. These were anything but easy to install. It was a several step process and ultimately it would not work on their garage door...it would only turn on the light. My brother-in-law gave up trying to make it work. We will keep them and attempt to program them to our door for backup units. I certainly liked the old version much better."
1,Terrible service by skylink,"First I purchased the Skylink Transmitter G6MR since it was ""100%"" compatible with my Overhead Door Company opener. It IS NOT. I was told by skylink support to go by a 12 volt adapter for the receiver or get the model 69N that would work with my current Model 100A receiver.So, I returned the G6MR and ordered the 69N and guess what. It is not compatible with the U100! According to the first support tech it is, but the second one says they mad a mistake. So I have to make another return to amazon and buy a model 66C!Just not worth all the aggravation.David"
1,Waste of money,Spent over two hours trying to match frequency with no sucess to a lift master unit. Never buy this unit
2,"This is NOT a ""Universal"" Garage Door Remote Control.","Please research the exact model using other on line sources in order to make sure that this remote is compatable with your garage door opener. Upon return of the item, the seller promptly refunded my credit card."
3,Ok product,The remotes were easy to set up and program. The response is some what lacking in that sometimes the garage will open/close on the first push of the button and from a good distance away (end of the driveway). Other instances the button is pushed 3-5 times with the car stopped right in front of the garage.
1,50% opportunity it will work,"I purchased a similar product over 10 years ago, re-programed it 9 years ago and worked for 8 year. Last year I found this remote, got it and worked, so went ahead and got a second one just a few weeks ago, identical to the first one but it has never worked, sure it blinks, it has the same awkward jumpers as the first one (instead of easy to use dip switches), but it just will not open my door."

2,Amigas y Rivales Poorly edited,"I saw the full version and they cut very interesting part as was when Roxana killed her made and how was that Laura's sister came back to life. I am thrilled at all. Poor editing, very poor."
3,"Interesante volverla a ver, pero no me gustó del todo.","Fue rico volver a ver la novela.Como se sabe ya éstas ediciones vienen super editadas, pero da pesar que eliminen historias que le dan cierta gracia a la novela como la de Moncho en el rol de peluquero o la conversión a ""buena"" de la amiga de Roxana. Sobretodo si le meten escenas de ""recuerdos"" y además bien largas o, escenas eternas que no llevan a nada y que sobran porque se vuelven redundantes; podrían utilizar ese tiempo para las otras historias.Sin embargo me divirtió volverla a ver, aunque no me dejó satisfecho.De todas las novelas editadas que he visto, la mejor ha sido ""Pasión"". Ahora empezaré a ver ""Heridas de Amor"", vamos a ver que tal sale."
1,bad,"this book was a crude attempt to make fun of star wars. if you want a good one see ""space balls"" the movie."
3,Couldn't agree more: First Album vis a vis Forward Motion,"I'm in complete agreement with Paul Gallagher's review. The first album, simply titled The Section, is significantly better than Forward Motion - IMHO. *Please* release The Section (with the pie on the front : )"
3,Mixed Bag,"Microphone is oddly routed and utilized though ""decent"". Headset is comically large. Let the kids use this one, not an adult headset. Nothing special in the sound department considering the size. There's some better choices for the money."
4,"Nice Quality, for ages 14 and up, so it says...","I ordered these for my son's Halloween Constume. They are a nice quality, The metal frames are 2-tone and there is a Harry Potter label on the side wires which I thought was a nice touch. The packaging says ""Adult Glasses not Intended for Children below the age of 14"". I do not remember seeing this in the description (but honestly, I do not know if I read it at all). My son is an average 10 y/o and the glasses are a little big for him, they slide down his nose a bit and he has to push them up. I think this adds something to the overall look of the costume and am pleased. I would not recommended these glasses for kids under 10 simply becaue they would be too big."
3,For smaller heads,"Bought it as a fun gift for my friends because we are going to Harry Potter world (we are all in our late 20s btw). They are cute but are definitely made for kids heads, they fit my face but are not the most comfortable."
3,Too big for 5 year old...,"He loved getting them, but the glasses would not stay on his face very well. Too bad, because they are really cute."
2,Adult size,I am not sure why I thought these were children's size. They are not and were even large on me.
5,Great kid glasses,"After reading other reviews, I wasn't sure about buying these, but the price was right. They have held up very well. I have two, active boys and they are not easy on these, but they are still holding up after lots of Harry Potter action! They fit my 6 yr. old well, pretty big still for the 3 yr. old."
4,Perfect match for Harry,"These wire glasses were the hit for Halloween!They made the costume and my son really looked the part.They are pretty durable as well, my soon to be 8 year old hasn't broken them yet."
4,Excellent Harry glasses!,"Our son really looks like Harry Potter in these glasses and they fit his face really well --he is 7 years old but is about the size of a 9 or 10 year old. They fit me, too, and I am small adult -I think they fit the target Harry Potter age group well. Very nice quality for a costume; the lenses even offer UV protection! The frames are like low quality regular glasses that you would get from glasses store."
1,Cheap alternative sent by Cashco1000,"If you think you are ordering officially licensed Harry Potter glasses with the Harry Potter name on the side (that fit most, have UV protection and that most reviewers really like), I would not place your order if it is to be filled by Cashco1000. They sent me a cheap alternative (that is not licensed, does not have the name on the side, etc. and is not only too big for my 7-year-old, but is also too big for me and my 6'1"" husband). Cashco1000 says that this happens all the time. If your Amazon picture shows the officially licensed glasses, according to Cashco1000, Amazon posted this without their knowledge. Their picture should be of the cheap alternative (that should not, in my humble opinion, possibly get a positive review by anybody unrelated to that seller's company). Seller does say I'll get a full refund, but I'm still out my time and energy. Please be careful out there fellow shoppers."
1,Better Harry Potter Glasses on the Market!,"CONS:- May not fit your face at all- Lenses are not the same size as Harry's- Lenses are spread too far about from each other to look like authentic glasses**The Halloween glasses from Rubie's are not any better & face the same inaccuracy issues****Search for ""Tinetto Round Glasses"" to find the MOST AUTHENTIC Harry Potter-style glasses on the market**"
4,Very good for a costume,"I wore these glasses to the Harry Potter premiere and they went very well with my costume. However, when I got it there was already some gold showing from underneath the black. But covering it up with sharpie fixed it well. So far, I think they're overall durable. If you're looking for a good costume for a good price, these are the ones to get."
3,Exactly what you pay for - a cheap pair of Harry Potter glasses,"Bought these to where to the midnight release of Deathly Hallows Pt. II. They're just a cheap pair of glasses, nothing special."
5,Heaven in a pencil.,"I love these pencils and use them regularly for figure drawing and general sketching. I also use them for finished work, especially massed areas of dark value. The hardness and large lead size are just what I need for medium-sized works. I'll buy them again in a heartbeat."
1,Broken Graphite,I have to sharpen constantly the pencils because the point falls off. The graphie inside is broken. This was a waste of my money.
4,Not what I expected...,"I bought these to assist me when learning to draw, and sadly, I was a bit disapointed when they arrived. These are listed as 'jet black' but they're basically plain graphite pencils. I thought they'd be kind of like black colored pencils for sketching. I'm disapointed for the fact that I ordered this along with some wooden #2 pencils."
4,Pretty good for outlining,"The pencil did make the outlines a bit darker, but it's not completely black and it can still be erased. Although, I don't know if that's good or bad, because it could be good if you make a mistake or want to change something, you could erase and change it, but it's also bad because if you want to keep the outline of it, you'll have to erase softly and more than likely it might smudge. At the same time, it's good for shading and helps in blending shadows and a bit of color with proper technique. Overall, if you want the permanent outline, get the solid black one, but if you want a bit of challenge or experiment, try these pencils out."
2,very cheap wood,I agree with the previous reviewer who found these pencils to be poor quality.They are made with very cheap wood that sticks and splinters in a sharpener resulting in broken lead and much frustration. Ive already used an inch off the pencils just trying to sharpen them. Im hoping the Design brand I also ordered are better quality.I know the standard in general for pencils has gone way down over the years and the quality of wood is a common problem.
3,I bought it only for Rules of Engagement...,"At the time I bought this, the only thing I was interested in was Rules of Engagement - it was unavailable by itself. RoE is a decent movie. The others are gorp and I just scanned through them without spotting any cinematic triumphal moments."
3,disappointed,"I was excited when I ordered this book. I was shocked when I received the item. It was not much thicker than a pamphlet and did not have the depth of information I expected. If your skater has had ballet classes, dance and or drama, than the information in this book will not be new. Most coaches understand the basics of putting together a balanced program together with choreography that enhances each move. This book was basic and I should have saved my money and kept looking for one that was more in-depth. I was truly disappointed with this one. I thought it was over rated and definitely not worth the price."
5,Did Fly The Bird-Dog in Viet Nam,It was a good book and I did fly with Bird-Dog shot down three times. One of my pilots wasw killed. And took me for six days to get back to South Viet Nam.
1,Auto zone balancer installation tool,"HI, Im writing this review to make sure no one buys this installation tool, it will snap the bolt into your crank with very little force, im building a 383 sbc blown 671 supercharger, I needed a installer to install a new crank hub, this tool is trash---trust me and buy good one, proform looks good, but i havent got it yet, the issue is that the bolts have a hole for the universal ends and the metal is very thin, thats why it snapped, from what ive reserched, the proform looks solid all the way (crank adapter) if its not solid it will fail, good luck, I hope you understand what im saying (same as auto zone 27144)"
1,Doesn't fit,"I bought this, being informed that it worked for Chrysler products. The salesperson was half right. There is a crankshaft adaptor with thread identical to the crankshaft harmonic balancer bolt; but it isn't long enough to engage the recessed threads inside the crankshaft. Being totally useless to me, I returned it."
3,book ok but disk not much help,The book is very basic and helpful as a starter but the disk is difficult to navigate
4,Eay to use,"I love these cameras. They are so easy to use, and a lot easier to deal with when it comes time to get the film developed. No fuss with having to wind the film and no worry on your part of exposing the film to light."
2,"Cheap, Inexpensive way of taking Color Pics!","Low in Price, these Camera's are a great way of taking Color Shots. However, being lower in Price than the Max HQ and the Advantix Single Use Camera's you sometimes tend to get Pics that aren't as clear. A Great idea for a Child's School Camp or Excursion."
2,"good history, but biased and very speculative...","an interesting read, but about halfway through the book it is clear that the author is alligned with the miami cuban community, which has proven itself to be even more oppressive of free speech than fidel's cuba.....there do not appear to be any direct interviews between the author and castro, and she appears to assume a great deal of knowledge about places she only visits briefly (for a week, for ex.)...a great deal of histrionic conjecture....too bad, because it detracts from the many truths the author does reveal about thisbrutal and heartless dictator..."
2,A comprhensive work plagued by superficial analysis,"Geyer's book is interesting, but espouses numerous unsubstantiated claims. Her main sources are personal interviews conducted with numerous persons once connected with Fidel Castro. An overwhelming bias against Castro surfaces in these interviews, as most of the persons interviewed are expatriated Cubans who possess a considerable, although justified contempt for Castro. As a text to be used in academic research, Guerilla Prince is, therefore, inadequate. Geyer's book, however, does offer some intriguing pyschological analysis of Castro and his policies. Her summary of Cuban history, and Castro's early life are particularly insightful. Yet Geyer's pitifalls are superficial analysis and outlandish conspiratorial claims which inflate the status of Castro, making him appear as global figure more powerful than he ever was."
1,Pop psychology masquerading as journalism.,"Although ""Guerrilla Prince: The Untold Story of Fidel Castro,"" is touted by the publisher as ""historically, politically and psychologically definitive, the consummate account of the meticulously secretive Cuban leader,"" Geyer's account of Castro rings hollow. It is filled with cliches and weak writing. Geyer arrives at overreaching conclusions supported largely by testimony from (what else would you expect?) anti-Castro exiles. While she shows that Castro was a master at political and personal manipulation -- nothing new there -- Geyer shallowly explores Castro's psyche, leaving many still unanswered questions. That Castro is an unbending dictator is not a new revelation. But in trying to answer the all-important questions -- who is Fidel and what makes him tick -- Geyer resorts to pop psychology and tenuous connections."
4,Great start off on Castro's Story,"This is a great book! I do think it is up to the reader to analize the information condensed in this book. They are all from outside perspectives.Still, I believe the book provides a good well rounded image of what Castro really is all about."
4,What a Story,"""God Shaped Hole"" was mesmorizing. Tiffanie DeBartolo will take your mind and turn it inside out with her love stories that are interwoven with desparity and tangled with self-doubt.Then, once your mind is totally consumed with the fire she's tented to, she washes you down with a pile of ocean water, drowning you in sorrow and pain and grief.But, not to be let down- there is a bit of understanding in there too!Great read. Very entertaining and very lovely.I love the pop culture references."
3,DeBartolot Can Write About Love (But Not Much Else),"Although everyone is raving about the story, which I dug, I have to point out that this is not a very well-written book. The scenes dealing with solely Jacob and Trixie and their love, like when Jacob cries on the beach, are obviously written from the heart and ring true. However, all the other characters - even the beloved friends - have stiff, unrealistic dialogue and the prose doesn't flow. How amazing this book could have been if the other characters were limited somewhat; we can all relate to the meaning of the title . . .but it novel itself is very cluttered up with unnecessary characters and awkward writing."
5,you want love? read it,"there's nothing like a love story to polarize reviewers. butto those of you who gave only one or two stars, i have to askyou: are you jealous? do you wish you were as cool as jacobgrace? or as sensitive and funny as beatrice jordan? i haveto think so, because GOD-SHAPED HOLE is a superfly love story.it hits it all: the laughter, the joy, the love, the feelingsof there-is-nothing-else-like-this-on-earth, the agony, thebitterness, the growth, the heartbreak, and then--finally,painfully--the feelings of loss and grief.it is a book that will make you exhilarated with the thrill of romance and the possibility of happiness. who doesn't want tohear about this? who doesn't want to hear about it from a writer who is nuanced and hip and totally, totally honest?i don't know. maybe you one- and two-star people out therewill be happy waiting for the end of the world with a copy of BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL in your hand. maybe that will comfort your heart. but me, i'll take GOD-SHAPED HOLE."
1,ooooh pleezeeee,"i must be getting old. this book was highly recommended to me by someone who isn't an avid reader so i should have known better. reading this book was like eating junk food. it definitely did not ""fill me up."" it was way too sappy for me. i think college-age girls will enjoy this read though. i did like the sex though - pretty raw and explicit (see I am getting old). everyone has written that they flew through this book. i am struggling to finish it. it has been too predictable from the onset."
1,"Could you lay on the sap a little thicker, please?","Purple prose, flat characters, predictable plot. This reads like something you'd write for a high school creative writing class. Clearly a first novel. Let's hope it's her last."
2,thought i might like,I have only used a couple of times. The disc should give longer use. . I never get it out anymore. You cannot use a longer lasting disc so to much waste for me. May be great for someone else.
2,Started good then faded,"Update 1/19/10 - This camera was great in the beginning but we started having problems with it about 6 months after we got it. Have now replaced it with a Sony. I wouldn't buy this if I had it to do again. On the bright side, when it's working the picture quality is still pretty high.We got this camcorder just before Christmas so I've only had a couple of opportunities to use it. That being said, overall this camera has performed pretty well. My only complaint is that it doesn't do well in low light (maybe none of them do). It's very easy to use and gives you a good picture on playback. Compared to other camcorders, I think this one's a pretty good value."
1,Very Difficult Camera,"Very disgusted with this cameara. Hitachi's web site said this camera had a built in flash, the unit does not have one. I got constant disc error when using various diss. They have 4 formats and is it extremely difficult to figure out which one to use and when. Once you start to record on a disc, if you get a disc error the data is lost and the disc is ruined. To get rid of disc error you need to take out disc, you can not finalize to save data because of the error and your precious moments taped are now gone. I returened it and bought a Panasonic Pv-gs300 and had it taping sucessfuly within an hour. Simple to use, great detail in the film"
4,Live with the Southwest Louisiana Mass Choir,"The CD I rec'd was in very good condition, although I didn't care for the case it came in."
3,Needs Some Work,"This album wasn't exactly packed with what I consider Naughty By Nature's greatest hits, but it wasn't all too bad. I picked it up figuring that it would be packed with hits from their previous albums, but was somewhat dissapointed once I started listening to it. Overall I'd say that it wasn't too bad, but unless you're a die-hard N.B.N fan, I'd suggest you stick to IICons or one of their better albums."
4,GREATEST HITS INDEED,"TREACH,VIN-ROCK AND KAY-GEE HAVE MADE A DECADE OF HITS IN A COARSE OF ONLY THREE LP'S. NAUGHTY BY NATURE IS LIKE THE FIRST RAP GROUP,BEFORE THE LOST BOYZ,TO RAP ABOUT BAD TIMES AND MAKING SOMETHING GOOD OUT OF THEM WITH ANTHEMS. I'M NOT A BIG N-B-N FAN BUT YOU CAN'T FRONT ON THEM,THIS IS THEIR BEST IN A SET,REPRESENT. EAST ORANGE,NJ'S N-B-N IS HISTORY MAKING ON THIS DISC. COP IT."
3,this is a pretty good cd i like it.,"this C.D is a pretty good cd but, I dont like some of the songs on it.This C.D is cool!"
4,BUY THIS ALBUM!,"This is the only NBN album you will ever need 2 have! It has all the classics: Hip Hop Hooray, OPP, Feel Me Flow, Clap Yo Hands, and more! Buy it if U R a true hip-hop fan!"
3,all that you will ever need by nbn,"it seems that every summer that naughty has a catchy song and then disappears.and this disc sums up their careers perfectly.catchy and something to bounce to like hip hop hooray,opp&feel me flow but nothing that is classic or essential still give them credit for surviving the rap game for a solid decade."
5,"I especially liked the cover. Very colorful,indeed.",I especially liked the guy with the half open head with the cool things coming out like the plane and the remote control and the blimp and the compact disk. That was so neat
2,Inaccurate,"Schildt makes numerous errors.One example:printf(""%f"", sizeof f);Clearly wrong: sizeof f has does not have type double.Another example:/* Write 6 integers to a disk file. */void put_rec(int rec[6], FILE *fp){int len;len = fwrite(rec, sizeof rec, 1, fp);if (len != 1) printf(""write error"");}Wrong again; rec is converted to a pointer to int, rather than an array of 6 ints, because it is in the parameter of a function (try it if you don't believe me).Another example:You may also declare main() as void if it does not return a value.Not at all. main returns int and only int.One last example:x = *p * (*p++);This was his attempt to give a code snippet where the order of evaluation is specified. It's blatantly wrong: *p or may or may not be evaluated before p++.There are many many other errors. This book is only useful as a reference if you are competent enough with C to not need it, in which case, why buy it?"
1,Not Good,The book has errors in the examples. A lot of these examples do not work. This shows that the book was written carelessly by a guy that just wanted to make some bucks with a crappy product.
3,Had to revise my review,"I never had C in school but had to pick it up to handle engineering subroutines. While painful apparently this book is the Bible of C programming. Using basically this book and tidbits I found on-line basically I learned C programming well enough to do my job. This book is one of ""The Staples of C Programming"".The book looks very impressive but is not balanced. E.g. it devotes a lot of it's 800+ pages discussing arcane subjects (like the origin of the B programming language) and doesn't treat basic concepts fully or properly. I still can't get a print fcn to do a line feed and nowhere in Schmidt's book does it really even fully explain the print function.Also he devotes 1/2 of a page to LOOPS: that's it! Basically you figure out what to do by compiling your programs hundreds of times.Also there are really NO really detailed program examples for the concepts. You read about something and that's it. There are some code fragments but not enough to illustrate critical C concepts."
2,"Content OK, but it's in a hundred pieces.","This is a reference book, and not a bad one. I would have given it 4 stars, but the quality of the binding is terrible.I think a few pages fell out, the first time I opened this book. After some mild usage, I've just got a big ole pile of papers, with a bunch of missing pages."
5,The best book on C,"This is the best book on C ever written with a possible exception of K&R. But what K&R explains in terse language , this book explains in a lot of depth and in a manner which can be practically implemented.I have loads of books on C, but think that this one is by far the best and ought to be used by each and every student who ever wishes to learn C."
5,If I could have only one book on C this would be it!,"As a computer science major at UCO, I have spent a greatdeal of time in libraries, bookstores, and on the weblooking for material on the C launguage to help me with my programming assignments. Schildt's book, C The Complete Reference 3e, is THE book I refer to most often. Schildt clearly explains topics such as: data structures, linked lists, stacks, queues, and gives code examples for virtually every keyword in the launguage! If you want to learn C or expand your knowledge of it, you MUST get this book!"
4,A good book for C learners,"When I contact C, its this book that led me into the entrance of C programming. And I like its 1988 version more than the 1995/1998 version. I think the Dos-based graphic skill is important for anyone who want to lean more about the machnism of computer graphics"
4,Easy to read,I read this book with in 3 weeks. I found it very good written who ever there are some minor mistakes in the explonation
4,Good learning book,This was a requirement for college. I have the kept the book after college though because I think it is good reference.
5,Very useful,"While void main(void) is technically incorrect by the ANSI standard (and a very common mistake among writers), the book is still very useful. The book is referenced very frequently for obscure methods by programmers I work with and I would hate to be without it. Very organized and concise."
2,Not what I expected,"After purchasing this book and skimming through all of it while reading the sections I was interested in more thoroughly (VBScript and Custom Forms), and then going through everything a 2nd time, I was extremely disappointed.I found the Author was not thorough at all when going over the Outlook Library objects, methods, and properties. I was constantly going to the MSDN site to fill in the gaps. The sample code was also quite limited I thought.In my entire life, this book is the only book I have ever taken back to the store for a refund. I instead purchased the QUE book written by Patricia Cardoza, which I have found to be far more to my liking."
2,The book title should not mention Outlook,"I have been disappointed by this book. I wanted it mostly to learn how to program Outlook. When I started reading it, I have realized that only a small portion of it was dedicated to Outlook. Perhaps that I am harsh against the book value because I am not part of the intended readers but I guess that even readers interested to programming Exchange would not find much value of this book. I am saying so because the book is huge close to a thousand pages but it sounds like a cut and paste of the Exchange programmer user manual. When I purchase a book like this one, I expect it to be a complement to the product documentation, to give a better insight of how and why a given software works like it does. This book does not deliver up to these expectations. The best Outlook programming book that I have found is: Microsoft Outlook Programming, Jumpstart for Administrators, Developers, and Power Users. Skip this one."
4,Different...,"This is the second book I've read by Brockway, and it's very different than the other one...The plot was quite scandalous, of course. One thing I wished Connie would have done was to write a better prologue, maybe explaining Letty's situation and how she got to be taking Agatha's train ticket in the first place. Elliot was a wonderful gentleman. Honorable. He was of complete propriety, while Letty came from theater. The way this book was written was almost...boring. Maybe... I can't put my finger on it, but it almost seems as if it was an early piece. There were very intense moments, though only a few love scenes. It certainly is not the best, but it is definitely worthy of reading, for the emotion stress Letty must endure is significant."
3,Flawed but entertaining; 3 & 1/2 stars,"Letty is a delightful character, so much fun. Elliot is a sweet man; it's rather pleasant to have a hero who is simply a nice man. And Catherine is a selfish little.....Intriging and funny with just a hint of heartache and danger. The first love scene is a disappointment; it's more about hurt and anger than anything else. Very romantic ending, even if it seems a little out of character for Elliot.My first Connie Brockway book. Good enough to try more from her, but not the best I've read."
2,All froth and no substance,"My first foray with Connie Brockway was ""All Through The Night"". Too bad - it created rather high expectations from this author!. Unfortunately, ""The Bridal Season"" was silly, shallow, weakly plotted and poplulated by one dimensional characters. I think that the author can really crank up the angst when she goes for the more serious side of romance and she is not cut out to be a writer of what is essentially light comedy. I agree wholeheartedly with reviewers Darlene and Jane Harrison; the author is clearly capable of much, much more. I struggled to read this and found my mind wandering almost from the first page. The narrative was full of out of context flavour which did not make it easier to digest. I won't give up on the author, however, as she is very talented. However, I don't believe this sort of nonsense is her true forte."
3,"Strong acting, but...lacking","It's about 3 parties of people with agendas screwing each other over. There's a very Gratuitous Sex Scene, a kidnapping, a psycho, etc... but somehow it fails to gel. It's really not bad, it's just.... not good either. It tries very, very hard to be True Romance (with a smarter, tougher girl) but misses.It's sort of sweet, but also sort of obvious. And I HATE the lame title.Upside? Joy Bryant acts her socks (and pretty much every thing else, in the aforementioned GSS) off - she's good. Dominic Purcel is as adorable as always. The two dumb kidnappers are excellent, the psycho is terrific, they're all pretty much brilliant. I wish I could put my finger on why this movie didn't do it for me. Oh well."
3,Decent Performance,"Clever use of ex-convict as main character trying to come up with a plan to squeak through a series of criminal misfortune. Decent story line, good solid performance by the players, strong use of lesser known players to carry the flick. I'd recommend it if you enjoy a good plot."
1,"1 for Ali, 0 for the movie","I give 1 star for Ali Larter who always look very pretty, but she's far to be a good actress, she tries to be seductress but she doesn't get it. However she's worth a look in the movie. The movie it's really bad and you see they didn't had enough resources to make it good, the director uses many POV's of the characters. That makes things difficult to follow the story for the audience. They used many nudity in the movie so they can attract people, bad resource to attact the attention of the movie. Not the best movie I've ever seen."
3,little rascals,I wanted my grandson to see the Little Rascals-he was somewhat amused but it wasn't as funny as I remembered.
1,Nokia 8801,"The battery charger doesn't work anymore, the light is up but no current flowing through, I test my cell phone with another charger from a friend, and it is fine.It is very bad."
4,"Great product, weird feel","We love this product. Truly has changed our Rat Terrier's attitude in a fantastic way. My only quam with the device is the buttons - they're uncomfortable to press. I know that's a nit, but I had to find something, right?As for anyone who has battery issues: I don't know why, but sometimes it seems like the batteries are dead. Once replaced, the unit works again. BUT, I went back and tested all the previously ""bad"" batteries, and they're fine. I'm guessing that a reseat of the battery pack will get it working again. Next time it seems the batteries are dead, I'll give it a whirl."
2,not what I expected for the money,"The zapper on this works about 50% the time. Fortunately the buzzer sound works 75% of the time and that's usually enough to get my puppy's attention. Also, it gets turned off easily, so when you're standing there trying to get the zapper to work it isn't even on anymore. If more expensive = works better, this product is overpriced for how poorly it works."
5,shock collar,"We have a pug and it works great with him. He was a runner not anymore. the settings go upto 10, we have it set at 2. Within a constant couple of hours walking and stopping he was controlable."
3,A little disappointed in battery life and distance,I am a little disappointed in battery life of the unit. Also the range is much closer than described. After one training session as described by the manual you must replace the batteries in the collar.
4,"Works, but some things to consider","First thing I did was test these things on myself. I didn't think it was fair to use them until I knew how strong they were. I could handle it up to 5, and that's as high as I use it on our dogs. As for the device itself, I think they work well. The range is decent, even working through walls in a pinch. The size is great, even for small dogs. The biggest downside is the batteries. They don't last long. The one in the remote is fine, but the ones in the collars seem to die fairly frequently. They seems to last a few weeks at the most."
4,Great Training Aid,"The collar was easy to get started with, pretty much take it out of the box, read the instruction and place on pet. Our dog was having problems ""returning"" to us when called. A few gentle reminders with the collar and some possitive reinforcement, she has become a much more attentive companion."
5,Excellent buy,"We purchased this for our beagle, who would run wild throughout the neighborhood when he got loose. After working with him for only a few days, he responds immediatly, not to the shock, but to the beep. We try to use the shock as infrequently as possible, and have found that is really isn't necessary all that often. Every once in a while he will challenge the beep, and we are forced to shock, but really not that often. This item has not only allowed us to enjoy time with our pet outside, but has given him more freedom to roam the yard.I've read that the battery is an issue. We've used it for a few weeks, and no problems, but have always remembered to turn it off. I can see, though, how not remembering could be an issue."
1,Died,"First one they sent us was broken, they replaced it promptly. The replacement worked well until the first batteries wore down and then when I replaced the batteries it no longer worked. Tried different batteries just to make sure that wasnt the issue, still nothing"
5,Excellent,We were unable to train our Yorkie to stop unaccepted behavior. The sound is enough to get her attention and very rarely the use of gentle stimulation is necessary. Her size is tiny but she at 14 mths acts tough. This has helped us immensely. She happier and so are we.
3,Could Be Better,"The collar works fine but is too big for ""Little Dogs"". I had to adjust it with zip ties to be tight enough for my dog to feel it."
3,Batterys go dead to fast,Well it does work well when the batteries are up to speed. The range is great and it does not appear to stun my dog into outer space. That being said the batteries are going dead after just two days. I only buzzed the dog twice in two days and the batteries were dead on the third. I think you might have to turn off the dog collar itself to keep this from happening. This is a pain. It should go into idle mode or something to prevent this. Other collars have this feature. OK i am out.....
4,Excellent training tool.,"I already own the Petsafe bark activated collar which is excellent. But I decided to take it one step further by using the remote controlled version so I could train him with commands and such. This collar has an audible ""beep"" to use as a training tool or you can use various levels of shock to train. I rarely use the shock. The audible beep works like a ""clicker"" training tool. I have worked with my Sheltie regularly for over a month and now I don't need the collar. He responds to my voice command instantly and is very obedient after using this tool. I highly recommend! The only drawback is it is a pain in the butt to change batteries. You have to use a screwdriver to access the battery compartment. Otherwise I would have given this device a 5 star rating. Because of the battery access difficulty I give it a 4 star rating."
2,Eats batteries,"I have had 3 training collars. The first two stopped working after a week or two. Both were replaced by the manufacturer. Because of the interruptions of either not having a working collar, or batteries being dead (batteries last less than 2 weeks) I haven't found the trainer to be very successful. Unless you want to keep replacement batteries (found at jewelry counters and are just under $5), I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,Good product,"The collar works well. This collar has good shock adjustment for any size dog. Mine is 10lbs so I wanted a collar with minimal shock. The other collar I had made the dog jump and yelp. This collar when adjusted down, the dog will stop react calmly and listen. Although the distance is only about 50 feet at best."
4,Worked great for 2 weeks then it stopped working,This product was great! But unfortunately it broke after 2 weeks. My dog is 11 pounds and I only had to shock him 2 times before hearing the beep was enogh for him to stop running out of our yard.
3,Eh...,The battery life is short. Mainly because it's hard to tell if it's on or off and has likely been left on numerous times.
2,Should not buy,"I went through the set up and checked the collar for operation. It checked out okay, but my dog never responded to it.I may return it when I have time to deal with the process!"
4,Pet Safe Remote,Works better than the regular shock collar for dogs with smooth coats since it does not have to be directly on the vocal cords. It is wise to turn it off after awhile to save the batteries. If we are expecting visitors we turn it on.
1,Doesn't Work Half The Time (Poor Button Response),"I returned the first one I bought thinking it was just defective. The second one did the same thing and I ended up returning that too. I don't know if the problem is in the remote or the receiver but about half the time when you press the buttons (either shock or beep) it doesn't do ANYTHING.Sometimes I had to press the button 2 or 3 times until it would beep or shock so this device will often times fail you when you really need it. Because of the delay in delivering the shock/beep it makes it very difficult to train your dog. The dog doesn't know why you shocked him AFTER he has misbehaved, you need to be able to correct the dog right away. When it works, it works great but 50% reliability is just not acceptable."
2,Breaks easily,"I have been having a a lot of problems with this animal collar. The range is very bad; sometimes at close range it doesn't even work- very bad for attempting to train a dog because timing is everything. The remote control stopped working. I assumed it was the battery which I had just replaced, so I used a new battery. It still does not work. The battery moves so I had to put a piece of tape to hold it in place. It was working a little but now won't work either. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product. I have barely even had it or used it for more than 2 months."
3,Not completely reliable,"This collar works 95% of the time. At times you have to press the tone button several times or for several seconds for it to sound. It hasn't happened often but I worry this will fail me when I really need it. I suggest all buyers to try this several times in your own hand before you dispose of the packaging and decide to keep this product. Maybe mine is just a fluke?????? I am giving it 3 stars because when it does work, it is very effective. I have a 30lb dog and I only need to use it on 3. I have tried all the settings in my own hand and I wouldn't go any higher than 3, unless you absolutely have to."
1,Poor Range and battery life.,"This is useless even for our little 10 pound dog.The range is terrible, if the dog is more than 20 feet away it doesnt work at all which is pretty much useless when the dog takes off after a squirrel or another dog.Example. You're outside in the yard with the dog, someone comes down the street walking their dog. Of course your dog takes off after the walking dog, by the time you grab the remote and try to correct your dog it's already out of range the signal and you have to chase after your dog anyway. The battery life is ridicuously short. It takes 2 watch type batteries which cost at least $5 and they go dead quickly even when you havent been correcting the dog. I turn off the collar whenever the dog is inside (which is most of the time) but they still die in a matter of a few days.NOT Recomended."
2,;(,Wouldn't buy this product again. The batteries last about one week and then need replacing. So I spend about $25/month just in batteries for it.
2,GOOD --- WHILE IT LASTED,PURCHASED THIS FOR UNRULY DOG AND IT WORKED AS STATED -- FOR TWO MONTHS. HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT W/ MANUFACTURER BUT HAVE GOTTEN NOWHERE SO FAR.
1,Not worth the price,The Petsafe collar does not work. It keeps shutting off when you most need it. I have tried new batteries. This product does not deliver as promised. I am returning it after 60 days.
5,"I am keeping my Pomeranian, Missy Lou, thanks to Petsafe","I have a 15 lb. Pomeranian who is just 18 months old. Live at a Senior Housing unit and I could not stop her from barking at everyone. She is quiet in the apartment, but if someone comes in to the building, or if she saw someone strange walking around building, she would go into another zone and no matter what I have tried, it didn't work. I had the citronella spray (nope), the shock collar (I didn't like shocking her, it was very painful for her and for me), and then as a last resort, I bought the Petsafe remote. I put it on her two days ago and only used the shock at #6 twice, and now I just have to pick up the remote, and she stops whatever she is doing that I am scolding her for. It is amazing. This morning I didn't even have the collar on, and I picked up the remote and she stopped. Have I died and gone to heaven. I was at the point of looking for a new home for her. I thank you for this great remote trainer."
1,Simply doesn't work.,"This product has spotty effectiveness at best. After the first couple of uses, it stopped working. We have replaced the batteries a few times, to no avail. Sometimes it shocks, mostly it doesn't. Apparently I have missed the deadline for returns, so this was a complete waste of money."
4,Remote Trainer,"After months-years of my almost 2 year old Boston Terrier ignoring all my commands, I finally resorted to trying this product. I had immediate success with the product, and barely even have to use the shock on her. As soon as she hears the warning beep, she knows what is up. This product has helped tremendously!"
2,Worked Well but poor battery life and Broke Quickly,"Ok so the product performed as needed, and even though it was draining those expensive little coin cell batteries quickly it did what we needed so we were happy with it overall.That is, until a fatal design flaw caused it to stop working after 6 months of light use. The antenna comes out of the collar box, and is woven into the fabric collar. There is not a good enough strain relief or something because it becomes detached from the circuit board and then the thing wont work outside of 10 ft range (can you say useless) because there's no antenna connection. I would have opened it up and soldered it back onto the circuit baord, but the plastic shell is not servicable since its 2 brittle pieces of plastic glued together.Cheaply made. If you get 1 year of use out of it you'll be lucky so keep that in mind!!!!!!!!"
4,"""Better together"" batteries are not the right ones","The trainer itself is working fine, but wanted to alert folks, and Amazon.com that the ""Better together"" batteries are NOT the right ones. The small dog unit shipped to me uses 2 3V CR2032s, but I was sent 2 pre-packaged 6V RFA-67s (PetSafe's part number) which are obviously for some other unit."
3,collar,it works fdor a while then stops even with battery change. and if dog is near fence then collar doesnt work to well. Needs to be able to adjust more so connection to dogs neck is better.
5,Works great!,This collar is great if you are within range to use the remote. I like the fact that I can give a warning beep without using the voltage.
2,inconsistent,"When this product works, it's great. Unfortunately it randomly turns itself on and off so just when you need it, it isn't there. I would not recommend buying this product."
1,Doesn't work on my dogs barking,I have a yorkie jack russell mix and this didn't work on my dog to stop him from barking and nothing. First off the collar was to big I had to adjust it and cut quite a bit off so it would fit his neck. That was not that big a deal. But when it came to getting my dog to stop barking at nothing it didn't work he just shook and continued barking. One good thing I can say is that it did help in stopping him from digging. I bought this collar to help me with two things one and most important was to control his barking and second was to stop him from digging. Well like I said it works good on getting him to stop digging but no matter how high I go on the control he doesn't stop barking. I would not recommend this collar if you want to control your dogs nonsense barking.
4,Zapped,This item is okay. It turns off on its own a lot and that obviously means you have no control. The product could be better
2,Not a good choice for Hunters,"I bought this product expecting it to do what i needed done and it worked the first time i pressed the button and the range was about one hundred yards but then when i continued to use this product throughout the week i noticed the range getting smaller and smaller, then my dog figured out if she can get away from me as fast as she can she can run get out of the range of the collar and get away. I was very displeased with this product because at the end of the first week i bought it the range was down to about ten yards. Also this collar goes through batteries like crazy. I bough twenty-five batteries to go with it and within three weeks i had to order another twenty- five batteries and trust me these batteries are quite expensive."
3,Ok with a couple of problems,"It works well enough, although it seems a bit finicky about whether it will respond to the command module or not.The shock seems pretty weak, and of the three small dogs (10-20 lbs) that we have had it on, only one noticed the shock at all, even on the highest setting.They all respond quite well to the tone however (when it decides to respond to the control button.)The collar goes through batteries pretty quickly, just from being powered on. So remember to power if off when ever it is not in use.For the price, it's a decent trainer."
2,Not for an aggressive dog!,"We never tried the collar because we decided after reading the instruction manual that we needed to return the collar. The manual says very plainly that it's not to be used on an aggressive dog. Our Chuckie Lee can be aggressive so we decided the collar wasn't for him. I'm only writing to save someone the hassle of ordering this product if their dog is aggressive. We are returning the collar, but are stuck with the extra batteries that we bought. They can't be returned so I suggest trying the collar before buying extra batteries. I'm sure that it's a good product, but it's not for us. We're going to find an animal trainer to help us. Our dog hates our cats and we have lots of them. C. L. is a rescue dog so we don't know his background."
2,Works Like Hell (Literal),"It doesn't work that well. My dog still barks and doesn't follow my commands. My neighbors still complain about this. I feel like I wasted my money on this. It works just a tad bit. Next time, I'll buy it directly from the pet shop, and I'll bring my dog as a test."
2,Worked well for a month,Worked well for a month.. got it out next spring and it was dead... tried everything... a high dollar collar with a low dollar life spam. Hard to find quality these days. Probably made in China.
3,disappointed,"I tried to use this on my cat and couldn't get it to work reliably. It was a larger cat with short hair and I tried everything I could think of, but the only way I could get it too work is to have the collar very tight on the cat (looked like it was choking the cat) and also have the fur slightly damp. I know the shock worked because I tried it on my arm, but it appears that it just won't keep contact with the cats skin enough to work. Yes, I know its a ""dog"" collar, but I figured it should still work."
2,Bad video,The promotional video starts buy the girl saying sit repeatedly while pulling up on the dog's leash. This is what the company considers an obedient dog?
5,I'm a Good Dog now!,"Our Jack Russell puppy is so smart and easy to train to do tricks, but he just would not come! He knows his boundaries, but we also had trouble with him running into the street after children and were afraid he would get hit. If he fails to respond when we call (which is very seldom now!) we buzz him and he comes running. We only had to use the zapper a couple of times. He's so much more responsive now. This is an outstanding training tool for the independent small dog."
5,Love it!,I am VERY happy with this purchase... I wish the batteries lasted a bit longer but still very happy with this product! Am using it to teach my shih tzu to not bite strangers when they come to the door.
5,Results within the first 10 minutes,"Amazing !!! Responded to verbal commands using the Petsafe collar within the first 8 to 10 minutes.Our 6 month old Pitbull mix puppy was uncontrollable especially around our 14 year old Border Collie. He wouldn't stop jumping up on her and nipping at her ears and rear legs. We only had to buzz him twice along with the command ""STOP' and the behavior ceased. After that, we simply used the tone button with the verbal command when he would 'forget' and he's reminded. We simply leave the collar on him ( turned off ) and now he's calmer and more obedient. Next, we have to work on not chasing the cats.This was our puppies last chance before we found him another home, which we did not want to do. We had tried everything ( training sites, books, videos, etc) and nothing worked. THIS WORKED !!!"
4,can't complain,"It's a little on the large side for our 6 and 7 pound ""yappy"" Yorkie-poo's, but it's okay. We don't keep it on them for very long. Only during the busy time of the day when we need to open the front door (for the kid's little friends who come and go all afternoon).The problems: 1. They bark. 2. They slip out the door and run away.With this thing, there is very little of either because a little ""jolt"" (we have it set on #1) is enough to correct their behavior. Now the trick will be to see if it sticks."
2,"Terrible Battery Life, Low Quality Parts, But it Works","While there is little doubt that this collar will have your dog responding to the stimulus immediately, I don't think it is good value for the money. The battery lasted no more than a week and these are not cheap batteries to replace. The plastic buckle is cheap and easily breakable. There is no loop for a leash to attach so your dog will need to wear at least two collars if you are on a walk and want to use both leash and shock collar. My strong recommendation would be to spend a little more money and get a collar with a rechargeable battery and higher quality craftsmanship."
4,"Boy, do we have a stubborn dog","Well, it works, that's the main thing. But for our female ""German Lab Chow"", it's a major challenge to her will. We've been using it for two weeks and out of the 1-10 range have the collar set at 7 - yes, 7. If you believe your dog has a extremely stubborn streak, then brace yourself for a battle."
5,"Awesome products, worked on a stubborn mule of a dog!","This product is excellent! We tried everything, even obidence classes on my jack-a-pug and NOTHING worked, but this collar did!"
2,Works and then breaks,"Doesn't seem that many of these sorts of devices work for very long. The Petsafe Little Dog Remote trainer is no different. The transmitter works via a 9V battery while the collar unit works on a couple of button batteries. The unit works ok but the battery life goes down the drain in only a few days. If you forget to turn the collar off, you'll be faced with dead batteries in a short time.This is unacceptable because the collar unit, while not even being used to administer the slight electrical shock, runs down the battery quite quickly by just being on.The unit failed to function in less than a year. Not recommended."
1,"worked well, but broke quickly","This collar worked well for our dog for several months, but then the wire antenna inside the collar broke off where it attaches to the receiver. We tried soldering it back on, but it broke again. It is just a bad design, not meant to last. it only works within about 10 feet without the antenna, and our dog figured this out.We just bought one of the Innotek units after a friend highly recommended it - no antenna to break, and is rechargeable."
5,Great Great Great,This collar works wonders.... Only had to use the electic twice now I just give our Pug a beep and he is all good. This system really changed my dogs behavior... This is a must have....
4,Works good for the Money,For the price this product works well. It does have a somewhat limited range but as long as you know this going in it fits the bill. It is good to have the tone only correction. It most cases that is enough to get my beagles attention. Be sure to turn off the collar when not in use to conserve the battery. If you need more than a hundred feet of range or a super heavy duty system spend twice the price and get the pro collar and remote. If not this one is well worth the money.
3,"Works, but the remote is horrible.","We have a 6-month old dog that likes to jump up onto furniture and fight though the fence with the neighbor's dog. We tried for weeks to get him trained to stay down, and not bark when outside. We finally bought a training collar.The actual collar isn't too large compared to the dog, and it seems comfortable on him, as far as he doesn't try to remove it. So far the batteries have lasted for a long time, but we also only use it while doing actual training.The ability to dial-in the amount of shock works very well for a stubborn dog that likes to ignore commands.The remote however is horrible. The buttons sink and tilt in all directions often missing the actual contact, which means you never know if it actually worked, or if the dog ignored the command. The battery door is also loose and easily falls out."
2,Does Not Last -stop working less than a year.,"I had returned the first PDL training collar because it was using batteries like crazy. I had to replace batteries every other day. I finally figured that it might be defective, and contact Amazon. They replaced it with another one. The collar works as suppose to, but within another 5 months-it stop working. Though, I got a use of it because my dog is now trained not to go too far into my neighbor yard. I was hoping I can use the same one for my new dog, but it stop working less than one year. I will be looking for another dog training collor, but not this one."
2,Poor design for small dogs,"Although this collar does what its designed to do, the collar design is very poor- esp for little dogs. The antenna is attached to the inside of the collar and thus, on small (less than 15 inch neck dogs) you CANNOT get the collar clasp flatly closed and cut the collar to fit properly.Also, the on/off switch is on the front of the collar where it could be easily hit/bumped off by a stumble or wrestling with another dog.The remote doesn't always work well and often you have to hit the tone only or stimuli button more than once to get it to work. There is also no way to tell if the batteries are getting low.Not worth the retail price of over a hundred dollars."
1,too big for a little dog,We bought this collar thinking it was for a little dog and we have a 14 lb Italian greyhound who is actually quite big for the breed. The smallest setting is so big it could go around his neck twice. This product is more for medium to large dogs as it is long enough to fit a great dane with room to spare.
5,Very pleased,"I bought this collar for my 6 pound Yorkie-poo because of his excessive barking. I was a little concerned at first, because he's so tiny. However, this collar is perfectly safe and it works very well. I've had this collar for about two months now and I've only had to use the shock option two or three times (at level one). He responds very well to the beep option alone. Not to mention, after only a week of using the collar, his barking decreased quite a bit - even while not wearing the collar. I am very pleased with this collar and would definitely recommend it to others."
4,Very satisfied,"I have a very sweet, but VERY stubborn dog. When she gets excited she won't listen to a word I say or respond to a thing I do, so I finally decided to get a shock collar. Although I originally thought it was a bit harsh, once I recieved it I was ok with it. It has variable settings which I tested on myself before putting it on my dog and also an audible tone for corrections if you don't want to shock your dog. My dog has really responded well to the collar. I take my dog to the fire station with me when it's cold and everyone has noticed a vast improvement. After having the product for about a week the reciever stopped working. I contacted the seller and they quickly sent me a new one. Overall I'd say I had a great experience with this seller."
2,disappointing,"This product claimed it had a ""training manual."" It does not, at least, not in the sense of giving you any idea how to use the product in a humane way to teach the dog something. It just has a manual telling how the device works (ie, push the button to shock him). It also includes a little light bulb you can use to make sure the shock works-- come on, if this is so humane, it shouldn't hurt too badly to test it on you own arm.Also, Amazon said ""better together"" with a replacement battery, so I ordered it. And it wasn't for this device!"
4,battery eats power all the time,love this its pavlows secret- if you use beep before shock you can train them to obey beep only. Big problem is knowing whether its on or not hold in button when light blinks 2x its on 3x its off- have gone thru so many batteries and at 10 a pop its expensive if you leave it on the batteries will die very quickly so teach- train and turn it off
2,Turns off often,"This product turns itself off often, or the button is in a bad place and it gets bumped by my dog often, either way, the few times we need it like when our dog is trying to steal food or eat the cat, the collar has turned off. Very frustrating, I am returning it as this is already a replacement from the first one we got that did the same thing."
2,Battery runs down constantly,I would like to return the item. It's not been good for the money because the battery constantly runs down even with limited use. I do turn it off between sessions. I even bought a new battery thinking the one that came with it must not be fresh. Same thing. You use it a couple times and the battery is zip.I would not recommend due to the battery issues.
2,Problem,I can't get this product to work on dog. Works fine off the dog. I put it on the dog and it shuts off. Don't know what the problem is?Please HELP
1,Don't waste your time,"I purchased this for my 9 pound Brussels Griffon with the hopes that it would help with correcting small problems. I followed the directions but could hardly ever get the collar to work correctly. Half the time I pressed it, nothing would happen . . . so I would continue to press over and over again and it finally came on shocking my puppy for no reason at all.Would not recommend this - not reliable at all."
2,Poor range. Poor battery life.,"This unit's range is no more than 30 feet, definitely not the advertised 100 yards. The batteries are the expensive lithium CR2032s which do not last very long. On top of that they are a pain to replace. You need a small (I mean really small, not your standard #1 cabinet, smaller) screwdriver to get the batteries out, and the the screws are not captive. Luckily I haven't lost them yet. The stimulation mode is adjustable and it has a beeping mode which is good. But again, with the limited range, it's only good in the yard, nowhere else. The remote uses a 9 volt battery which lasts long and is easy to replace, but it also falls apart if you accidentally drop it on the ground. Cheap. You get what you pay for."
5,Love this product,i love this product because it works..my 2 puppies are doing great with this product. They know now when the collars go on they have to mind me completely and they do. The batteries are lasting longer than I thought too.
2,does not work,"bought this for my 16lb king charles, i used it rarely and always turned the off button when not in use..battery did not last..replaced batteries in color and remote 2x and it still has no power,,,,i feel it was a waste of money...the batteries should have lasted and the fact that now it does not work at all even with all new batteries very disappointed with product..."
3,No direction for the stories,"I think that most writers have a burnout where they just can't come up with an original story line. I suspect that this is the problem with these stories. After re-inventing Spiderman and his support cast, they ran out of steam. They re-examine the character and his opponents, give a slightly more realist approach to their creation and motivations, and turn them loose. But they're beginning to run out of ""new slant on an old face"" ideas. Hopefully they will begin to go in their own direction, like the other ""Ultimate"" story lines have gone."
3,Not as big as I thought,I thought it was big.the close up of the image makes it big.its ok though. nice design. its just not that thick.
2,Disappointing...,"The bracelet arrived quickly and was as described except its color was dull, unshiny and not particularly appealing. I was disappointed in its lack of brightness compared to the photo in the description and returned it immediately."
2,Not as it appears,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this bracelet is neither masculine looking nor 8 1/2 inches in length. It might be acceptable to give to a young teen, but I would hesitate if considering it for an adult. It doesn't have a particularly substantial look or feel to it and it comes closer to appearing feminine."
1,For skinny wrists only!!!,"From the picture and another review, I expected this to be a nice bracelet. First it is not 8 1/2"". If you stretched it to its breaking point, it might be 8 1/4"" from the tip of the chain to the end of the clasp. The chain itself is less than 8"".It might fit nicely on a child's wrist, but on a grown male, it will probably cut off your circulation. The links might be 6mm long, but I doubt they are much more than 2mm wide. When you open the box, you'll be surprised how small this is, especially if you paid $85 for it (or even $60 in a Gold Box deal).I've always been wary of jewelry from Amazon, but this was an absolute disappointment. I'm surprised that anyone could call this tiny chain 'masculine' looking."
2,Bald dragon love...WTF?,"Throughout this entire novel I felt like I was watching a badly acted out soap opera with an odd dragon and a bald heroine. First off it wasn't original - virgin tied to a tree as a sacrifice. Hungry villain villagers are trying to appease falls in love instead of hunger. Yeah. Deja vu big time. If you want a little erotic entertainment, by all means partake, but don't expect to be intelligently titillated. But, than I wouldn't watch a porno movie and expect to see academy award winning acting right, so what the heck do I know right?"
5,always right on,"The oppenheims never fail to recommend kid tested toys, books and videos that have been perfect gifts for my friends' kids. I read a bad review from a grouch who thought name calling was helpful.It was probably written by a toy person who did not get a good review.I think the Oppenheims use excellent toy testers and I truly respect the assessments done by children. They are always right on!!Myra Klahr"
2,Goes over VERY few toys.,"I thought I'd love this book and that it would help me pick the right toys for my baby on the way. Unfortunately, I quickly realized that the book analyzes very few toys (only the ones sent to them for free). It actually recommends very few toys too. The book helped me learn the categories of toys I should be on the lookout for but that's it. Also, their website being updated more regularly than the book, I'm tempted to sell my book back and use only their website for guidance. Haven't learned anything from it so I say : Not recommended."
5,Great guide for new parents,I have purchased several issues of this book. Everyone is very pleased with the contents. A very valued source of reference for all new parents.Two books were for my grandchildren and I wanted them to have the best in educational toys at the appropriate ages.
5,Wonderful resource for parents!,"While their website does provide a good amount of information, the book is much more in depth and detailed. Our son, 6 months old, loves all the toys we have gotten him that were listed as winners by the book. We make our christmas shopping lists based upon the recommendations from this book. I would highly recommend this to any new parent."
1,not inpressed,"My wife and I bought this book but found that the baby bargains toy reviews were better. Not much meat to anything in this book and to be honest..it's like a reference guide, not a book."
5,Saved time & money!,"Gotta just say, coming out of the holidays, this book turned out to be such a life saver! It ended up saving me not only time, but money. This year, we had no disappointments with toys that don't work, or do what they're supposed to do. I was able to look up toys, read about them, get ideas, suggestions. Have to say, I'll be consulting this book throughout the year, for birthdays, etc."
5,Awesome Sauce!!,"I really love this product. I have about five of them that have never been sharpened because they come in all the accessory packs that prismacolor makes. They also last for ever! This is basically a clear colored pencil that can be used to bend together to colors such as green and blue will blend to aqua:) I can also be used to easily fill in those pesky little white spots that are sometimes left behind when coloring sloppily or lightly. These are worth ever penny and are quite cheap. I have found that they don't work very well with the verithin pencils also made by prismacolor and other brands of pencils, such as crayola. They are also good if you make a mistake, you simply color over the mistake and you can usually just go right over it with the new color. I would recommend these to anyone who uses prismacolor pencils to any extent."
1,"2 months, no camcorder and no info","i purchased on a cps warranty for my camcorderi had a problem with my lcd screenfirst, i had to send it to ny from califoriawhen supposedly there are local repair places!!??had to send a $30 check for them to returnnow, 2 months later and still no camcorder and no infohopefully this is just a fluke and not the normi'm bummed i don't have a camcorder for christmasand curious as to what the outcome will bei will report back"
5,A must-read sanity-saver for anyone getting divorced!,"This book is worth it's weight in gold. It covers all there is to know about divorce: financial, custody/visitation, legal, how to deal with lawyers, emotional, and practical aspects. My ex recommended it to me, and it was amazing help in getting through the process -- I only wish she had read it more herself!"
4,"Don't forget, ""consumables"" also means batteries.","This is a terrific labeller. I bought it after reading David Allen's ""Getting Things Done"" and falling in love with his organizing system. My home filing system is now not only organized but legible.It has a lot of bells and whistles I'll probably never need - I've been using the same typeface but there are others as well as frames if you are so deoratively inclined - but overall it's a workhorse.The reason I give it four stars instead of five? No AC-Adapter plug. If my portable cassette player can have an adapter and still cost no more than this labeller, it can too. Six AA batteries is excessive, although I've printed hundreds of labels without yet losing my charge.Of course, I should be investing in rechargeables.An excellent product that works like it is supposed to."
1,Very short battery life,"This labeler would have been perfect if you could plug it into an outlet, or battery life was longer. Every feature is excellent. However, the battery life is maddeningly short. It seems like batteries only last one day, if not less. I don't use it a lot - just for my home office, so it's completely unacceptable. Seemingly every time I charge them, it works fine when I put them in, and next day batteries are dead."
5,Great Product,"This is a great label maker, and has always been reliable for me. I've had it for about 2 years now, and am still running on the batteries it came with. Although i do not use it excessively, I use it enough to be able to give a good rating.What I like about this machine is it gives 5 different sizes, fonts, and styles to choose from. You can underline it, put a frame around it, etc. The tape is easily replaceable and it's not too hard to peel back. A built in scissor tool cuts the tape perfectly every time.I've never had a problem with a jam, or short battery life, so disregard those who have. Just keep it in good condition and it will work perfectly."
4,a no brainer,"It's so cheap you can't go wrong, especially if you get a refurbished unit. The replacement tape is really cheap too. My only complaints are that there is no memory for recalling common labels, and it's a real pain trying to peal the back off the tape."
2,"Works, but glitchy, poor manual","Just got this device yesterday. Had a problem immidiately because the print size wouldn't change despite my trying everything. Nothing in the manual addressed or corrected the problem. Called customer assistance and they were able to suggest a somewhat cryptic fix not described in the manual, but then acted as though this wasn't a problem. They were not able to explain why this had happened in the first place or if/how often it would happen again. Worried this means I should expect more problems. Customer serive was rude and manual is not very detailed. No troubleshooting or FAQ."
5,Can I Come Over and Label Your Stuff?,"This was one of those ""I'm so glad I read the reviews"" purchases: there are much more expensive labelers out there, but this one kept getting such accolades that I thought I'd try it. I LOVE it. Right out of the plastic - no instructions read - I started making labels, and it completely changed the look of my files. It is truly the easiest thing ever and yet makes a world of difference. Right now I have no complaints: would it be terrific if it had an AC adapter instead of or as an alternative to the 6 AA batteries it requires? Sure. But I'll take it as it is for its ease of use and usefulness."
4,Excellent Product,"I've had my P-Touch for a couple of years. I use it mainly to label keys. I used to stick on a tiny label and ink on the apartment number. Inevitably either the label would fall off or the ink would smudge until the identification was no longer legible. The P-Touch produces a label that stays on and remains legible. Bravo!My complaints: As has been noted elsewhere, the backing is not easy to get off the label. You need nails of a certain length to pry it off. My second complaint is that if you print a short label ""6FW"" for instance, and need to fit it on a key, you end up cutting off half the label as the letters themselves take up only 40% of the label. This is a minor complaint and admittedly somewhat specifc to my usage of the labels for keys."
2,Labeller died - twice!!,"Bought the first one in 2006. Usage is very low as we use it for labelling kids' text books at the beginning of the year. Don't know why the unit stopped working in 2008. The Brother service centre said that the lifespan is considered good (give me a break!).As we have 4 rolls of tape, we decided to stick with the same brand and bought a 2nd unit shortly thereafter (not worth repairing the first unit). The 2nd unit just died last month - the LCD showed gibberish running about and then it stopped functioning altogther. Changing batteries didn't work.In addition, the metallic blue and pink M-tapes became spotted with small black dots in about 2 years, rendering any printout unreadable. I give up!!"
5,Very satisfied!,"First of all, I also had the initial frustration of trying to seperate the label from the sticker, however, I quickly learned that instead of trying to hold the label/sticker in your hand and try and seperate them with your finger nails, just hold the label against a flat surface (i.e., your desk) and with your finger nail just press down and pull apart - very easy (hope that helps).Great product, very easy to handle and type with your thumbs - you quickly get used to the keyboard. The labels are about $.../pack so keep that in mind."
4,Great little labeler,"This labeler comes with all the functionality that I need in order to label my products, and is remarkably easy to use. The learning curve is very slight, making this an easy tool to master.The only problem with this tool is that it doesn't come with an AC adapter, an will only run off batteries."
1,Had to replace it twice,"The first machine I had would print in only one size. I had it replaced, and the second machine has the same problem."
5,A great little labeler.,"This is a nice labeler. I got it as a present more than a year ago and have found that it has so many uses. I label everything with it. I can choose different type styles and sizes. I can underline and choose a frame. I can even check the length of the label before I print it.The labels are waterproof. I've labeled ice packs that I keep in the freezer and send to school with my kids. I've also labeled food containers that end up in the dishwasher. The labels do not come off when wet, not even in the dishwasher.There are so many uses for this labeler. It's a great buy."
4,It works well.,It's easy to use and prints out nicely. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a pain to remove the backing on the tape.
3,WHY this High Price?,"I purchased this labeler in 2005 for 35.00!Why does it cost over 100.00 today?It is exactly the same model!P-65.This machine has no bells and whistles, it is very simple,indeed pretty hokey outline features (logs, candy wrappers!) nodecent italics, no ""=/+"" signs.Mine worked fine until this year, when suddenly the ""e"" and the ""s"" ""x""keys stopped working. Now the machine is useless.I would NEVER pay this price for this labeler, NEVER. This is a realrip-off, unless it has some new features, which from my perusal it does not.The best thing about this machine is: M series tapes seem cheaper than others such as the ""Tz's"" AND: battery life is fabulous.Otherwise it is pretty much run of the mill."
5,Great product,"Works well, simple to use, inexpensive, very good quality printing with quite a few font variations and optional borders. Ribbons come in various color schemes, but they are expensive, so don't go nuts with it."
4,Excellent tool.,"This little baby works great for labeling just about anything. The interface is intuitive and easy to use, the print options are pretty good for an inexpensive machine, and print quality is superb. The only thing keeping this from garnering 5 stars is the printed label backing. Although it sticks great to just about anything, it can sometimes be a challenge to remove the backing from the tape."
4,fabulous machine,"I have been using this machine for about couple of weeks and impressed with it so far. It's pretty good. I wish it also accepted plastic tape as well ( I plan to purchase M831 which is compatible tape model). I also think it waste blank tape a lot on both ends. But, overall, it's a great useful machine. It's bad that Brother does not provide COVER for it. They sell it separately to make $$s. I am unhappy about this.Has anyone purchased cover for this model? If so, where did you purchase it from and for how much? Tx."
4,"Good product, good price","Bought it for my wife, and she's been a labeling fool since that day. My only complaint is it only runs on batteries. Not a big deal though, since we've been using it nonstop on the same batteries. Labels come off OK. Lots of font options. Nice product."
2,More apocalyptic teen soap opera,"""Busted!"", by Jerry B. Jenkins and Tim LaHaye, is #7 in their ""Left Behind: The Kids"" series of novels. Grounded in evangelical/fundamentalist Christian theology, the book continues the story of a group of young people living in an apocalyptic near future. The book's heroes continue their resistance mission while world leader Nicolae Carpathia continues to consolidate his new world order.""Busted!"" shows some of the flaws of the other books in the series. The dialogue is stiff and corny; many characters and scenes seem a bit forced. A significant theme of this story is the conversion of Jews to fundamentalist Christianity. I found the tone of the Jewish-related material in the book to be patronizing and paternalistic. Still, the story held my interest and did contain some intriguing elements. In some ways, it's like a good old fashioned dystopian sci-fi tale."
1,What is this?,"I was very unhappy with this music. Most songs are not from the original artists, it reminds me of the old K-Tel albums that used to advertise on TV. If I had to do it all over again, I would have saved my money."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"This 3 disc set could have more of the songs that were on the sopranos,and the songs were not performed by the groups or artists that had originaly performed them.All in all the songs are good,and i enjoy listning to them.I Just think it would of been nice to know that the songs were song by other people than was heard on the sopranos."
1,Fuhgeddaboutit is right,The songs are not done by original artists in many cases. This makes an otherwise excellent selection of music very disappointing. I have listened to these cd's once and won't again.
3,The song from the credits of the episode where Adriana dies,If anyone knows the song or artist from the credits of the episode where Adriana gets killed [...]. Its driving me nuts looking for this song.
1,Awful!!!!!!!!,"I was such a fool to buy this 3-CD set despite the negative reviews. I had been waiting soooo long for music from season 3 and 4, I simply ignored the existing reviews. This is a horrible collection, just awful. I skimmed through the cuts and heard enough from each to justify making these three CD's a ""gift"" to my public library. Please do NOT purchase this set, you will regret it, AND be out several dollars. Better to hope eventually the show's producers will put out a legitimate soundtrack of seasons 3, 4, etc."
2,Things they didn't tell you...,SOME of the music is by original artists - some are poor covers of songs. The MOST disappointing song is the THEME SONG - a very poor cover by an unknown band.
5,Best stuff for a clean bulk,"This product works great for two things. Bulking with minimal fat gain and just fat loss by itself. I've literally tried a million different supplements and this is the only one that works for me personally. I have a hard time getting rid of stomach fat and with the right diet this stuff works wonders. It's not a stimulant so don't expect a ephedra type supplement when you get this. That's not how it works. No jitters, or energy with this. Just good and relatively quick fat loss."
3,Basic communication,Sometimes it helps to have a little refresher on the basics and this book is a wonderful one.
2,Next book: 1001 ways to cook Y2K rations.,"The book was well written, but the premise of the book was flaky."
3,Consider This,"Seems to be a beautiful watch, and I was considering getting it, until I found the Certina DS First Automatic for about 1/3 the price. Great quality, decent service, and also a reputable (but not so widely known in the US) name. It is actually a Day/Date watch, but aside from that, I find the design to be strikingly similar. The movement is an ETA 2824-2, similar to the gussied up ETA Calibre 5 in the Tag. I'm not knocking the Tag, but if you are into it for the design more than the Tag name, you should definitely give this watch a looksy!"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!,I purchased a $1800 watch from this company as a gift for christmas. My husband decided he rather have another style (MORE EXPENSIVE) I returned the watch to the company with in the allowed time frame only to be told that because the RMA number was not on the box they would not return the product. The product was returned Un used 2 days after Christmas. They would not listen to the fact that I wanted to exchange for a more expensive item all they were focused on is what they could not do for me and how I did not follow the directions. I am so displeased and now want to take my money else where. I am disputing my credit card and discourage anyone from giving money to this company!!! They are more focused on rules than pleasing a customer who wanted a simple exchange and to spend additional money. THERE LOSS!!
2,Inaccurate time,"The watch looks nice. But mine is about 1 min/day slower. I know automatic watch is not as accurate as quartz ones. But 1 min/day shows poor workmanship. TAG is all about marketing. I will not buy another TAG no matter how good it looks.Oh more, the bezel scratches easily.Update:My mistake in putting 1min/week slower. In fact it is 1min/DAY slower. Thanks one of the readers for pointing out.I found out if I manually wind the watch everyday, I lose only 30 seconds/day. But what's the point of winding an automatic watch?But one benefit I got out of the watch is that it really improved my memory and arithmetic skills. I usually readjust the watch 7min faster every Sunday evening before I go to bed. Then everyday, I subtract a number of minute to get the accurate time. At the end of the week, the watch runs at the right time.See how creative you can get when you buy an expensive useless toy?"
3,Just Okay,"I looked forward to some interesting stories, and some of them were. There was a lack of depth to the information. Historical tales, such as the Titanic rescue were worthwhile. The story of the explosion in the Halifax harbor was very spectacular and historically pertinent. Overall, I didn't feel that the price was a good value for the quality of the work."
5,Cool car = ventshades,Ventshades were easy to install and very effective. The in-channel design makes for sleek look. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a similar product. Return policy is great! The first package shipped was damaged during transit. I filed a claim with Amazon and a new product was shipped before I returned the damaged one.
2,It was not what I spect !!,"The soft case don't protect the camera, the nylon and polyester are not good for protection. I think the camera needs a hard soft case. I'm going to buy other...., I loose my money."
5,Great stuff. Mindset is everything.,"I read this book for the first time at the beginning of this year. One thing I can say is that Dr. Kimbro emphasizes mindset as being one of the main reasons for people becoming success stories. If you tell yourself you can do something, you can. If you tell yourself you can't do something, you're probably right. This should be REQUIRED reading for all African-Americans."
5,Be The Very Best You Can Be,"I couldn't put it down and it's fulled of good encouragement and stories for a black person's point of view who's willing to do what it takes. This is nothing you can't deny or turn away from. Considered to be the black version of THINK AND GROW RICH, Mr. Kimbro put a superb excellence creating everything necessary for all black people and especially to all people we can make a difference if we willing to sacfrice what we want from life.Don't ever stop trying or believing hard on yourself. You only got a chance to make it all happen for YOU!"
3,great stories,"When someone overcome obstacles that is always a great to read. Many self help books have that and some stories are better than others. Dennis Kimbro has managed to find some inspirational stories. However, it has that new age feel in some parts of the book. Metaphysics is theory and many books speak of it as fact. Speculation cannot make you a better person. If you want to read the stories then get the book. If you want to change your life then don't get it for practical advice."
5,Think and Grow Rich: A Black Choice,This book is a must read for any individual interested in improving themselves and others around them. Highly motivational and inspirational. This book have transformed my life.
5,Think and Grow Rich: A Black Choice,Great book. I would recommend this book to anyone who want to be successful in their respective field.
5,Great book!,"I stumbled across this by chance and being African American, wondered what new information it had to offer. After the first few pages, I was completely drawn in. That the individuals profiled were able to, even in the most disheartening of conditions (slavery, illiteracy, and poverty) change ""their worlds"" leaves no excuse for us (Black or White), in this day and age to continue or promote a mediocre existence.This book is worth a second read, and a third, and a fourth ... until its words become law to you."
5,Awesome book! A must read for anyone not just African Americans!,This book was recommended by a friend. It is one of the best books I ever read. It is inspiring and motivational. It guides you through goal setting and steps for accomplishing the goals. I wish I had read this book years ago. Napoleon Hill hit the mark with this classic!!!
4,"Murder, mayhem and manipulation","The Murder of Dr. Chapman is an intriguing book for mystery lovers, psychology buffs and history afficionados.Ms. Wolfe is a brillant researcher and her rendering of Philadelphia in the 1800's makes me feel as if I were there.This is , amoung other things, an account of one of the first documented ""cons"" in U.S. history.I like the way that the author unfolded the story, piqueing my interest to find out more about the characters(although they were real live people!) and their actions.The trial scenes are riveting.Although the writing is gripping, I think that one forgets when reading it all of the hours of original research that had to go into it.I particularly liked the reference to historical figures that put it all into a larger context.I would definitely recommend this book!"
3,For Thomas fans.,Bought as gift for Thomas fan who enjoyed it. Another child of same age thought it was a stupid book from a boring T.V. show. I think in general the stories are outdated and some reflect classism. I think it would be more practical if the book had a sleeve on the cover to hold the disc.
4,BUEN PRODUCTO...,"LE QUEDARON MUY BIEN A MI TOYOTA CAMRY 1992, LE PUSE CUATRO ESTRELLAS PORQUE NO BENIAN EN LA CAJA ORIGUINAL Y NO PUDE RECLAMAR UN DESCUENTO DE PROVEEDOR."
4,One of the Best So Far,"I've collected a number of McFarlane figures, and this Owen Nolan figure has got to be one of the best I've seen so far. He's captured coming over the boards, most likely during a shift change(unless he was knocked over the boards). The attention paid to the detail of this figure is outstanding. This is the first McFarlane figure that you can look at and, without reading the back of the jersey, actually tell that it is Owen Nolan. Most of the figures come close to an actual likeness, but this one is almost dead on.I highly recommend this figure to anyone who loves collecting McFarlane figures. It is one of the best so far. If you love the Maple Leafs, or hockey in general, I recommend this figure."
1,Terrible,"Like the other reviewer said, this video is only for advanced dancers, even then I think advanced dancers need some instruction. The video starts and she just busts out with a ton of complicated moves. I pretty much stood there with my mouth open. Watching this video is just like turning on MTV and trying to copy what the dancers are doing in a video. She just starts going crazy and there is no breakdown to the moves AT ALL! Awful!!! I highly recommend D's Hip Hop Aerobics. She breaks down each and every move and it is fun and you learn some fun dance moves. During the workout I didn't really think I was working that hard, but the next morning I woke up sore. I really enjoy that DVD."
1,Doesn't break it down,I was very disappointed with this DVD. Although the choreography is interesting she does not break down the moves at all. I wouldn't reccommend this DVD to anyone who isn't interested in an ADVANCED Hip Hop Cardio routine.
1,Made Simple?,This is one of the most complicated dance DVD's I have tried to do. Not enough time taken to demo the moves in the tutorial and absolutely no help during the actual workout. Nice to look at but not nice to do.
2,Lisa - Not so Simple,"I purchased this video based on reviews that I had read. I was very disappointed with this workout. I did not find the steps ""simple"" and trying to keep up with the jerky moves wasn't easy. I did purchase this video used and I am glad that I did. I really don't care for the style or speed of this video and will probably just give it to someone else to try."
1,Bausch & Lomb Pre-Moistened Lens Cleaning Tissues,Terrible. I tried two of them and they both left greasy streaks on the lenses.
1,Can and will scratch plastic lens,"Pros...The formulation I have does a good job of removing haze build up, and light finger prints.Cons...The base material is NOT made of cotton, which is a fiber that will NOT scratch plastic. Instead, the base material is pulp-based (aka PAPER) and the wood fibers used to make paper are harsh and will scratch plastic after repeated use.I gave up on these and just use the remainder I have as hand-sanitizer. The alcohol is good for cleaning fingers, but the paper base was scratching my plastic lenses. I now, hot rinse my glasses first to remove any grit and dust particles, then clean with a soft cotton cloth and re-clean with 91% alcohol. Does a much better job than Bausch & Lomb Sight Savers."
1,Too wet for glasses! Don't buy these.,"These lens wipes are too wet for glasses. Open up a packet, unfold the cloth, and try to clean your glasses, and what you'll get is streaky smears of beaded water all over both lenses.No matter how many times I tried to wipe the glasses and get the liquid to evaporate, all the wipes do is smear beads of liquid and leave the glasses in worse condition than when I started. The only way for these to even be marginally useful is to follow a wipe immediately with a microfiber cloth to dry the lenses...which pretty much defeats the purpose of handy pocket wipes.Windex and paper towels is less of a hassle. Definitely do not waste your money on these."
1,Important Steps for Successful Use,"OK, so it took some experimenting, but these work well if you take the following steps:(1) Take the wipe out and lay it flat on a clean surface for 5 minutes to dry it out.(2) Use the wipe with side to side and up and down motion, not circular.(3) When done, get out a tissue and clean your glasses."
5,Excellent,"I have used these lens wipes in my job for years and they work the best of any lens wipes I have used. The individual packet makes it easy to keep them in the car, bag, pocket, backpack, etc."
1,What happened?!,"I LOVED these wipes. As someone who has to wear her glasses or be blind, the cleanliness of my lenses is a huge issue for me. I was thrilled for over a year with my Sight Savers wipes...then they suddenly changed the formulation or something, because now they leave horribly smears all over my lenses! It's not just a bad pack; I bought several before I believed the change was permanent.If you get hold of an older box, they'll be great, but if you buy new, they're a waste. (Now they're just like the Zeiss ones, which I also tried and disliked. Had the same problem with Walgreens store brand.)"
1,They changed the formula!!!!,"Warning folks, these USED to be great. If you're looking at reviews be sure to compare the date the review was written. MOST of the great reviews are from over a year ago. Most of the bad reviews are recent.They went and ruined a great product, probably in a money saving move. But the upshot is this product is not what it once was."
2,Leaves Some Lenses Cloudy,"I have glasses with an anti-scratch/anti-reflective coating. At first glace these wipes do an OK job -- but I did a lense/lense comparison with Zeiss Ultra Clarity wipes, and the difference was dramatic. The B&L leaves a cloudy film -- the Zeiss treated lense was sparkling clear."
1,USELES LENS TISSUES,THIS ITEM IS GARBAGE ...The wipes are too big ... too wet ... and only spread the dirt all over the lenses.Bought two boxes and threw them away.
5,I JUST LOVE THIS PRODUCT,"THESE PRE-MOISTENED LENS CLEANING TISSUES ARE JUST FANTASTIC FOR CLEANING YOUR EYEGLASS. THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN ANY DRUGSTORES OR ANY OTHER STORE IN MY AREA. WITHOUT AMAZON, I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THEM ANYWHRE AT ALL AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE AS MY GLASSES WOULD BE SO DIRTY.THE PACKAGING IS ALSO GREAT AS THE LITTLE INDIVIDUAL PLASTIC WRAPPED TISSUES CAN BE SLIPPED INTO YOUR PURSE OR BILLFOLD OR EVEN YOUR POCKET."
3,haven't tried but...,"i'm trying to find some of these little cloths and in reading the reviews on here i wonder if people who think the product has changed recently didn't get one of the other formulas by mistake? on the bausch and lomb website there are several products, including one with silicone, and the boxes all look exactly alike. check it out:[...]"
1,Lousy Lens Tissues,"Very disappointed in this product. Leaves smears and film on any screen surface I tried the tissues. My eyeglasses worse after I cleaned them with this product. Had to use soft cloth, warm water and mild soap to remove the mess these tissues left. Will never order any Bausch & Lomb products again. That's a promise."
1,Disappointed,"These wipes do not clean the glasses well. They are actually too moist and leave the glasses with water on the lenses. I need to re-wipe them with a tissue. The packaging seemed funny too. Almost like it had been emptied and re-filled with a product. The top of the box was sealed, yet the bottom was not. Left me suspicious. Disappointed regardless."
1,Streaks and Film!,"I've been buying these for years, they used to be spectacular, these large wipes though have too much solution, and leave massive amounts of film. Very nasty. I recently also ordered the set of 16 count boxes, those are much smaller wipes and work well. Stay away from this bulk box!"
2,Not good for cleaning glasses,These are too wet to clean glasses. They leave streaks. The Zeiss wipes are more dry and much better. The Bosch and Lomb are good for computer screens but too wet for glasses.
1,Dead in 1 year 2 weeks,Bought brand new and in 1 year and 2 weeks the bearings started making incredible noise. Very little warning that it was going to die. The 1 year warranty had expired at that point.
4,New Fathers,I never knew having a daughter would be so much fun. This book offers a slew of activities that all father\daughter relationships will benefit. From simple little games to gift ideas. After all our daughters deserve there childhood.
5,The Adventures of Isabel,This is absolutely my favorite children's book. Every little girl should read and enjoy it. I recommend it for big girls too. It's the best!
5,"There's only one problem,","no all Ogden Nash's books have been illustrated and published for children. Actually, there are two problems. Most of these books are now out of print."
2,QUALITY ISSUES,"WARPED DOOR THAT NEEDED BENT TO GET TO SEAL, MAX TOOL WOULD RATHER DISCOUNT ME $45 TO GET THE DOOR FIXED THAN TO REPLACE IT, I THINK BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARRY PARTS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. SILICONE SEALANT ON INSIDE SEAMS FALLING OFF. THE CABINET IS BUILT FAIRLY WELL. DEALER DOESN'T CARRY CONSUMABLE PARTS, AND GUN DOESN'T SEEM TO BE COMMON. I CAN'T FIND REPLACEMENT NOZZLES FOR IT, I GUESS I WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE A GUN THAT I CAN GET NOZZLES FOR. IF YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT, I WOULDN'T COUNT ON MAX TOOL FOR QUALITY ISSUES. IT TOOK NEAR TO 2 MONTHS TO RESOLVE THE DOOR ISSUE."
4,Excellent Guide,"Couldn't get much better. Comprehensive, all-inclusive, and easier to understand that Leonard Maltin. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars id my dissagreement with several of the ratings."
5,A definite must-buy,"I am updating from my 1995 version, which is falling apart! If you want to see what movies an actor has been in, or that a director has made, just look in the index. I rely on this book like I rely on the dictionary! AND I have found that the reviews are actually useful. Compared to Leonard Maltin's version, this is the one I would definitely pick."
3,Haven't read it all yet,"Had to buy this for a class. It is hard to get into, but I will finish it soon I am sure."
3,Pirates of the Inside Passage,"This book proves to be rather interesting and somewhat entertaining murder-mystery. Its part of Sue Henry's Alex Jensen and Jessie Arnold series. This time around, Jessie is without any doggies to help her around, a changed of pace for her. Most of the story take place aboard a ship and the story - which proves to be somewhat unoriginal - still was well written and paced.I thought due to the fact that it take place aboard a cruise ship, this was one of Sue Henry's lesser Alaskan atmospheric books. Tidbits of Alaskana flavors is shown but this proves to be rather a run of a mill thriller. This book is more of an Alex Jensen book with Jessie Arnold playing somewhat of a second fiddle.Despite of this rather lackluster endorsement, I still thought that the book was a page turner and the plot ended up working out pretty well. But overall, Sue Henry readers may regard this book as one of her lesser works."
3,Husky Owner,"Not as good as some of her books, but if you enjoy reading about Alaska with a little action this is a good book."
4,Death Takes Passage,This is another fast-paced murder mystery by Sue Henry with great descriptions of the Alaskan countryside. It keeps you guessing until the end.
4,Adept shipboard mystery in beautiful scenery,"Fundamentally, this is a good ""locked room"" sort of mystery. On a ship with less than 200 people (and 15 tons of gold) there's only so many places to look for a murder. Still, Alex and Jessie have quite a search on their hands as sub-plots emerge. Periodic, anonymous conversations by the bad guys only add to the suspense. The final 20% of the book has lots of action (and remarkably little blood).The use of the scenery is both a strong and weak point in the book. This series is a favorite because I enjoy the armchair traveling experience of going to Alaska in the books. Maybe it was having to listen to every word on tape, but the traveloge was a bit too much in this book.Finally, make sure to read the author's notes. This book is based on a real ship and a real anniversary sailing. Lots of real people are used as characters which is fun."
3,good book,"the book death takes passage was a good book but the beginning was very slow and it was hard to keep track on what was going on with alex and jessie, the theifs, and the people planing to steal the gold from the ship. But as the book went on it got more interesting and when the crooks hijacked the ship the book got really interesting and i couldn't put it down."
2,Not for a good review,This book is more for factual use-less knowledge that youwill never use in the real world of EMS. I would be happy to use mine as campfire kindling.
2,No Substance,Don't waste your time.It's way overpriced for the amount of content.Too much silent film that offer nothing in the way of historical info.Too short also.
4,Jack is back on track with this instalment,"I have to admit I stalled with the Repairman Jack series after HOSTS. However, it is back on track with HAUNTED AIR. When Jack is asked by a couple of fake Mediums to deal with a rival who is trashing their business he expects it to be an ordinary fix-it. Things become messy when he gets another seemingly unrelated job and a real ghost moves into the Medium's house.This is an enjoyable read with no real slow spots. Jack has obviously been affected by the events in HOSTS but the fix-it is both interesting and still has its funny moments. I'm looking forward to picking up the next book in this series again."
4,Tiny Tiny Print,"Another in the always enjoyable Repairman Jack series. If you liked the others, this one is in the same mold. But the print is very very small. I found it a great bother and I can't believe the author would settle for this."
1,Repairman Jack in need of Repairs,I have read EVERY book written by F. Paul Wilson and Repairman Jack novels are super. I have enjoyed every single one until now. This one just does not fill the bill.I got the feeling this text was simply an endeavor to continue with the character and blend with earlier novels.Rather boring and not up to par with previous works. Lots of the pages seem to be filler material to allow for a similar ending.Might be worth your while to save your money or check it out at the library. Pass on this one.
5,Guv's Triumph,"The long journey from dissertation to book is at last over. Carnochan's focus on counter-transference is essential for any therapist attempting to balance a humane versus *objective* approach to the patient/client/analysand. Therapists' careful self-revelations CAN further the cause of healing. In street parlance, ""keepin' it real"" is a far greater gift to the patient than the most rigorous ""technique."" Your technique often IS your subjectivity as a therapist. Kudos to Pedro and Sandor..."
5,clever and witty,"I've been searching for this book forever, and was glad to find it. The rhymes are clever and pointed, and, unfortunately, still timely. I first heard some of them on a Chad Mitchell Trio album. This is the man who wrote the lyrics for the songs from the Wizard of Oz, among others."
4,disturbing yet absolutely worth reading,"i have only read the 2nd volume of <<La Preuve>>, but it was enough to see that Agota Kristof is a truly one of a kind writer. i loved the character Lucas because of the refreshing way he seemed to be almost emotionless, acted completely on his mood, spoke with factual, to-the-point sentences, and how he was extraordinarily intelligent yet never thought so of himself. many parts of the book disturbed me quite a bit, especially the relationships between some of the characters. however, the cruel, sickly despressing reality of the world during war and bare human nature shown through the book is inspiring, and thought provoking. the plot was complex, and full of unpredictable twists. overall a great, unusual book."
2,Not much light,"This light gives you a bright ring but that's about it. If you need to light up anything but a small area, this light will not do it. Sorry but I am not to impressed."
4,Employee Retention,"Excellent book, well written and logical. Gives the reader the insight into what the intrinsic cost of replacing employees over and over again."
5,Dead or Alive's Evolution,"Dead or Alive's music, the hits featured in the DVD collection Evolution, stands the test of time. Peter Burns voice is almost a deep growl and definitely not what one would expect from him. DOA was born along side the MTV generation and consequently have always been a strikingly visual band. Glad to have all their hit videos and Japanese concert finally available on DVD. I just wish Dead or Alive would release some new music."
5,Law of Ueki Vol. 5,It was a action packed volume that lead us deeper into the thinking of Robert's 10.
4,Soul Touching Gospel,"I have purchased this CD for not only myself but for others that were looking for that old time religion gospel music, the kind that touched the soul and remained with you long after hearing the songs. I am just a nobody trying to tell everybody about Jesus, the song says what you are feeling as well as the many other songs on this CD. I would recommend to anyone looking for gospel music that relates to true Christian feelings."
4,Quirky filmmaking,"I appreciate the quirky filmmaking techniques used inHappy Endings, from the text narration to the disconnected storylines and split-screens. The personal stories are generally pretty entertaining, from the Mexican gigolo to the homosexual couples. Sometimes they go a bit too over the top. Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting style comes across as trying too hard. It's never really clear what her characters motives are, except for being as obnoxious and sleazy as possible. Overall,3.5 stars."
3,Great Acting but it finds a hard time to get to that Happy Ending.,"starring Lisa Kudrow, Tom Arnold (in a very suprising performance) and one of my favorite actresses Maggie Gyllenhaal in one of her best performances. The film itself goes in all directions telling three different strories that involve all the players indirectly then directly and then back. The film lacks depth in some areas and gets kinda depressing (Using subtitles instead of having a narrator was kinda unique). But the perfomances from Kudrow, Arnold, Jason Ritter (John's kid) and Gyllenhaal make it a real gem."
1,Don't waste your time,While I'll admit that there were some humorous lines in the dialogue and it kept me somewhat intrigued throughout the movie as to the various mysteries despite how slow it was ... the ending made me feel like I had completely wasted my time.There is really no story besides events in peoples' lives that I don't really care about and most of the characters have pretty much no redeeming qualities that make me like or respect them in any way.
3,Classic indy-type effort,"Lots of hand-held shots and relationship-driven drama get around a limited budget. The knowingly self-referential indy filmmaker also has an important part in one of the three Pulp-Fiction-style relationships that eventually intertwine, somewhat incoherently.Was the movie worth the investment in time? Yes, it's good enough for that. Lisa Kudrow and Tom Arnold are great in their roles. I wouldn't make a monetary investment in the movie though. It's not *that* good."
3,Funny US Comedy,It is a funny American comedy in which a group of friends and relatives engages into mutually per-lapped relationships.Two hours of screening is too much.
4,quit suprised,I was suprsied about what kids asked and wondering why I did not think about that answer myself
4,"Loved it, But....","First I have to say that I absolutly adored this Manga. In my opinion it was almost better then the Anime. However, the one thing that I had a problem with was the bad editing, especially in the last three books. There were quite a few blatent mistakes. Often there were even empty circles. I truly adore this Manga but I really wish that they had done a better job editing it. This however doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. This Manga series was absolutly splendid, you just have to try and ignore the mistakes."
3,Popeye's sad slide into sap and cheese,"I'm a completist, so I'm not sad that I bought this set. But now that I've watched it once, I don't need to watch it again. These cartoons are mildly entertaining, but elicited few laughs from me. They simply do not measure up to those in Volume 1, which were so delightfully quirky and creative."
3,WOW!,If you have to (want to) buy Popeye this is the series to buy. I prefer Volume One the best but there you go.
2,Popeye begins to poop out,I thoroughly enjoyed volumes 1 and 2 of Popeye classics. Volume 3 reflects a transitional period for Popeye in which he is relegated to nothing more than a hen-pecked fall guy. Even the animation appears to have suffered from the studio cut backs. From my personal view point...don't waste your money on this set unless you are interested only in the historical aspect of this pooped out period of Popeye's pathetic performance. Stick with Volume 1 and 2.
4,WAR!,"I received this set as a Christmas gift and just finished watching it.While many of you may be offended by the ""politically incorrect"" replications of the Japanese and German characters in some of these cartoons, you can only imagine how people felt back then after Pearl Harbor was bombed, not to mention the impact of WWII on everyone (if you haven't seen it I strongly recommend viewing the Ken Burns documentary called THE WAR, which you can find elsewhere on Amazon's site).How did YOU feel after 9/11? I'm guessing that's how everyone felt back in the early 1940's also. But instead of Osama it was Hitler and the Japanese! You can't imagine how people in theatres just loved seeing Popeye ""take care of"" the enemies as only Popeye could do!If you want to see the seldom (if ever) seen war classics, buy this DVD set.If, however, you're looking for the more common Popeye episodes you may be more familiar with (with Wimpy and more of Bluto), check out Volumes 1 & 2 instead."
4,VERY GOOD TEA,I was very pleased with this order. It was shipped in a timely fashion and is very good oolong tea. Will continue to buy from here.
3,Works enough,"Tried it out on a sweaty day in the rock gym, worked for the entirety of one climb. I'll use it up, but not sure I'll order more."
5,Chalk,If keeping a firm grip is important to your success use this product. It is less messy than a block of chalk also.
4,Cute! kitty,"I saw this on youtube.com, The other person who made a comment is apparently lyeing , Very sweet and cute and Frankly,I have yet to see something cuter"
1,Disturbing...,"The third in a series of the strangest ""Children's Programming"" I have seen in quite awhile. I have no idea who thought this was a good idea to market to little kids. The characters all hurt each other, launch each other into buildings, or hit each other with mallets while a voice over says ""Oh no, My Melody has an owwie now."" It is incredibly disturbing. The characters don't talk at all, just the eerie saccharine voice over. Skip this one, head for Hello Kitty's FurryTale Theater if you are looking for good Hello Kitty!"
5,Great movie,"Watched it on my x-box ...Great color! No problems with viewing!My wife and I try to have at least one escape movie a week,This was a great fun family film-typical of that time period (65-74)Ed and Rose in Red Oak, Iowa"
2,Mostly for Anorectics and Bulimics,"I picked up this book because all signs seemed to point to a self-help book about compulsive overeating, and how to stop binging, etc. What I found was that most of what I was reading pertained to anorexia and bulimia, rather than the rest of us who do not purge what we take in. It does contain some useful information here and there, but minimum at best. It is a helpful tool for realizing some of the underlying reasons behind the compulsive desire to eat, so it is not all a loss. However, it would have been nice to read more about how to overcome the problem. That section is rather small, which I find most important. The book is also filled with typing errors, which can be pretty annoying after the first 5, and you're still counting. Rather disappointing as a whole."
4,"Easy for a novice like myself to Install, works as described.","I'll start off by telling you that I am not a tech-savy person. With that being said, if you give me a ""how to YouTube video"", I can usually get the job done. I was operating with the original 1 GB of RAM that my computer shipped with. My computer had become a bit sluggish running bigger applications, so I decided it was time to stop putting off upgrading my RAM. The RAM was for my mid 2007 24 inch iMac. The RAM was easy to install. and has my computer running at full speed again. It literally feels like I am working on a different computer. If you are having any reservations about buying this RAM for an upgrade, I think you will be surprised at how simple the process is and what a big difference it will make.I recommend the following ""how to YouTube video"" for installing RAM. Just copy and paste this link: [...]"
2,fine when it works.,"I purchased two of these RAM sets: the first caused an immediate beep-of-death on my Mac. Amazon replaced it without question. The second worked *just long enough* for the replacement interval to lapse, then it, too, started causing intermittent crashes and death beeps. Unfortunately, by the time I found out that the second set was bad, it was too late to replace it.Kingston is usually a pretty good brand, but it seems like the quality control process for this product needs work."
5,My Mac Mini has 4GB RAM,The Core 2 Duo is only supposed to accept 2 GB of RAM. Mine works great with 4GB. Fusion really likes it!
4,Windows run 3GB and not 4GB RAM,"I just installed the 2x2GB RAM combo on my new Sony Vaio NR laptop. The BIOS shows that everything is fine, 4096 MB RAM is installed, but when I look at the Windows Vista System overview, it shows only 3062 MB RAM. Where is the rest of the RAM? I googled ""Vista 4GB RAM"" or ""Vista 32-bit 4GB RAM"" to see what was the problem and found out that if you are running 32-bit Windows, Windows Vista's architecture allows you to use only 3062 MB RAM, and you will never see all 4GB of RAM you've paid for."
5,Great book for the price. Delivered on time and condition better than expected,"I needed this book for a Mental Game Coaching certification course I was taking. The book arrived as advertised. As for the content in the book, this seems to be a very solid book on the applied research and understanding on sports psychology. As a non-psych specialist, I found it an easy read."
1,Not that good of a book.,"The book contains outdated information on hardware, but beyond that it is mostly a repeat of what is already covered in the Adobe Photoshop manual.I did not learn anything new from the few interactive examples in the book, and it looks like a resume for struggling young artists with all the user profiles. You would be bnetter off buying another Photoshop book and learn the video portion yourself. The book really needs an update for Photoshop CS and hopefully the author can get some professional examples other than his own home photos.I forced myself to try reading the book, but could not stomach any more and just skimmed through the last 200 pages."
1,Bad Samples Nothing New,"There is no professional level work in this book, and I did not find any useful content. No broadcast issues are covered and most of the book covers issues found in Photoshop Elements."
5,A must-have for ANY editor who uses Photoshop,"Quite simply, this is THE book to have if you're an NLE editor. Richard Harrington brings a comical, jovial style to what could be very boring geek speak and it makes it almost fun to go thru this book. (OK, that WAS a geeky comment, but whatever...)Anyhow, if you edit and need to work with images - be it for text or still images - Richard's book will help you step up your game. To get specific, I've never seen the process of Alpha channel creation - a key for any top-flight composition - broken down so simply. Other standout chapters include color correction, photo restoration and working with gradients.As if the printed material weren't enough, there are videos, PDF tutorials and some excellent goodies on the accompanying DVD-ROM. An absolute bargain."
5,This is a GREAT PHOTO SHOP BOOK!!!,"""Photoshop for Video"" is not only a well written book on learning how to use Photoshop as an artistic tool to create graphics, with lots of Gee-Wiz tips, techniques & tutorials to make you a better designer and Photoshop user, but if you have anything or want to have anything to do with using Photoshop along with your favorite non-linear video application, buy this book NOW.From DV to High Definition video this book is an indispensable reference guide on how to get your graphics from Photoshop into your editor correctly. The included DVD has 2 1/2 hours of training video, tutorials and images to work on to will help you sharpen your skills.My favorite parts in the book are the so called ""PROfile"" sections' highlighting editors and motion graphic designers and detailing the many ways these pro's use Photoshop to make graphics and save time."
5,friggin' greatatudes!,"i set this up to watch my parking lot and this is a constant show of the neighbors fighting and jamming plus my car is safe thanks to the notice with the product. Like a tv show, better than any, cause these neighbors, move over, brando in streetcar, and quit yellin' her name! Great product!"
4,Rollerball Classic,Great to find this item and get my pen (a high school graduation gift) working again
3,A little leaky; takes a gentle hand to write cleanly.,"I bought this to replace the old cartridge in a pen my father gave me, after I finally used up the remainder of the ink. The original was fairly generous in its ink flow, but this one is even more so. You need to touch very softly if you don't want blurry letters, but you need to be consistent if you want ink to run at all. it takes some getting used to.Also, the cartridge sold here was Chinese made. The original cartridge proudly stated that it was American. A slight disappointment, but not terribly surprising."
5,Love this book...and I am not a coach!,"Great book. The table of contents is set up to help you pick an activity to match your out come... communication, trust etc. I plan to use the activities for training sessions at work. (shhh I am not a coach but an instructional designer) The best part ....the wrap up questions. You can find activities anywhere but the wrap up questions will give participants that ""ah ha"" moment."
5,Great Read,"Well written book with lots of interesting ideas on team building trust and communication. I have been using it with our team and it has really opened theirs minds more, and moved them from the ME culture to US culture. If you are a class teacher, sports coach, office manager, or in any position of leading a group to success then GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great resource for anyone working with teens or teams,I had this book before and someone borrowed it and it never returned so I bought it again...that's how much I loved it! A lot of great activities to use in a number of situations and with a lot of different groups.
3,Great !,"Great booklet to have the kids practice...The only problem is that the answers are right beside the questions.... so in order to have my kids solve it - I have to photocopy it, covering the answers first...I did NOT read the reviews on thin one before purchasing.... had I known that - Would not have purchased it... too much hassle...."
4,It's Not About Butch,Knipmeyer's years of exploring and documenting historic inscriptions has produced a fascinating and informative catalog of western life on the Colorado Plateau. It is a great addition to any western history or culture library and a good coffee table piece. But the trite and overworked reference to Butch Cassidy is misleading -- a blatant and bad marketing ploy by the publisher. Knipmeyer's book contains numerous photos and historic snippets of folk more interesting and important in western history. Read it an enjoy a unique glimpse into the region's colorful stories!
4,Great Book!,"I bought this book as a guide to check out Butch Cassidy marks and their history, as I live in the Four Corners region. It's a really great book to read about the history of Southern Utah and its outlaws. If you're interested in old western outlaws or just geographical history of Southern Utah, this is a great read."
4,A Writer's Reference,A Writer's Reference by Diana Hacker (May 99 ed.) is a great reference book. It is required for my English Comp class and is filled with up-to-date information that is extremely helpful with writing in accordance with MLA guidelines.
5,A walk through time with a Great legal author,"Some may not agree with all or much of Holmes legal philosophy, but regardless, this book is well written and provides a first-hand perspective on one of America's foremost legal figures."
4,Good Book,"I am not a lawyer but I enjoy reading on the law. This book is definitely very educational. I like the way the book was set up with various sections such as liability, criminal law, and torts. If you have any interest in our laws, you will find this book to be a good read."
5,"""Reader-oriented"", In-depth, and Well-organized","I like this study guide more than any of the others I have seen because it communicates the essentials of NT Server to a greater depth. It also reads easy because it is very well-organized and ""reader-oriented"". I can tell that the author has a tremendous desire and talent to make sure the reader understands concepts. Highly recommended. Don't miss out. It has built my confidence for the exam, and I am only halfway through the book."
3,Too Much Errata in Review Questions,"This book, as well as the others in the New Riders MCSE series, is well-written and informative; however, take the answers to the exams in the book and on the enclosed CD with a grain of salt. Some of the errors are quite glaring, others are more subtle. It might be best to find some other method of self-assessment for the 70-067.Were it not for this shortcoming, I would have rated it five stars."
4,Well produced genuine Caribbean folk tales,"This book contains 13 short folk tales collected from Paule Barton - originally a Haitian goat herder. They are accompanied by drawings by Norman Lalibene who has captured the spirits of the stories. The stength of this book is that it has kept an oral flavor and oral structure while being sufficiently literary to make the stories easy to read and enjoyable - this is not an easy feat.In the tales you will see a card-shark outwitted, a man unwilling to make a decision,a duck handler mistrusting a witch, bargains with ghosts ... in short, bits of Caribbean life.If you enjoy folk tales, give this volume a chance."
4,Very Cute Panda,"My daughters own this panda and it is very cute and well made. However, it is not their favorite. They prefer the chipmunk, barn owl, and the guinea pig. They pretend they are vets and they nurse these little animals back to health."
5,Lovable Panda,"This little panda was a Christmas gift for my Sixteen year old daughter. She loves it, I love it, and she often takes it with her in her purse.I would recomend this for anyone, child or adult, who loves stuffed animals.I give it a 5-star rating."
5,Folkmanis Puppet Mini Panda,"Cute little finger puppet Panda. My granson has a nickname ""Anders Panders"" so he will receive this as a stocking stuffer. We will all have fun playing with it. Thanks."
3,"Weird, but I'm sure younger children would enjoy it","This book was about a girl named Faith who moved to Mexico. She didn't know how to speak Spanish, and didn't think it was possible for her to learn. This presented a problem at school, where most or all of the people didn't know how to speak English. She wanted to move back to San Fransico, but her mom said no. So, she built a rocket ship and ended up flying to some island. It was really strange, but I assume younger children would like it."
5,This is a hilarious book!,"Faith and the Electric Dogs is such a good book! Patrick Jennings, the book's author, let the reader see the story through the eyes of Edison, a Mexican street dog, or electric dog, who has been rescued by an American 11-year-old named Faith. Faith hates Mexico, mainly becuase a boy in her class is incredibly mean to her and teases her, and no one can understand her due to her not knowing Spanish. Therefore she decides to leave by rocket ship and go back to her home in San Francisco with Edison. The fuel leaks, though, and Eddy and Faith land on a bone-shaped island inhabited only by other electric dogs. I found the definitions in the margin very helpful, because they tell you the definitions of Spanish words and other languages, mostly Woof and Bow Wow. You don't even have to like dogs; anyone who loves a good laugh will love this easy-to-read book. This would make a great Christmas present!"
3,"Tool belt is fine, but hat is awful","My 2.5 yr-old loves wearing the tool belt, although he still prefers real tools! Some real tools will fit in this tool belt. The hat is a bust - will not stay on and is VERY frustrating.... he has a real hard hat, so this hat is collecting dust on a shelf."
2,Has some quirks,"This product was advertised as being ""under 3"", but when I received it the packaging said for ""3 and up"". I had ordered it for my 22 month old. He only received a couple of toys for Christmas (he mostly got clothes), so it kind of sucks that he really can't have this one! I do allow it for ""monitored"" play, but he really does not have the imagination yet to actually try and use it on anything. Also, you can't tell from the pictures, but the measuring ""tape"" does not fit into the toolbelt unless you take off both screws first. Then you have to put the screws BACK on to get it to stay on the toolbelt. My 6 year old can't even do that! However, I do like the hat and toolbelt for dress-up play. He does look pretty cute in his little get-up!"
3,Bob the Builder- Deluxe Talking Tool Belt Set,"This is a really cute product, but it's a little hard to get the tools in and out of the toolbelt. My son can't do it by himself and gets a little frustrated. He does love to wear it though with the hard hat. And he loves to push the button and ""talk"" to Bob while he's playing."
4,Great tools but the hat doesn't stay on!,"The tools in this set are very sturdy and have good detail. The belt is good too. There is a piece that plays part of the Bob the Builder theme song that is a big hit with my 2 year old. The only complaint I have is with the construction hat; my son loves it but whoever designed it did not think to put anything inside it to keep it secure on a childs head. It is literally just a round, plastic hat. It falls off constantly and that frustrates my son, my husband, and myself. I am looking to replace it with something more kid-friendly. Otherwise, great set of tools!"
4,Nice toy,My 15 month old son really loves the hammer & the talking toolbelt. He's a little young for rest. Nice toy though.
2,ok,The tools are great. But the hat doesn't stay on and the belt is too big to wrap around a child's waist. The belt is of poor quality as well.
5,Tells it like it is.,"Practical, wonderful, no-nonsense wisdom. The individual sermons are not long reads but give much for thought."
5,Practical and Spiritual!,"I liked the Cure of Ars Sermons, in fact more than many I have heard in the last 25 years. They speak to the person and address issues forthrightly and with sound catholic wisdom. I recommend this book to any priest, seminarian, religious or layperson."
1,TOO EXPENSIVE,GREAT PRODUCT THAT IS WAY OVERLY PRICED. THE LISTED SELLING PRICE IS ALMOST $2 PER BAR. WALMART AND TARGET SELLS IDENTICAL PRODUCT FOR AROUND 95 CENTS PER BAR.
4,These giants have a message for us all,"Katy Payne's Silent Thunder is a giant of a book about the giant of land animals. These salient creatures were here long, long before us. (Remember learning about the hairy mammoth?) They survived ice ages, plate technonics, fire, draught, meteors and more. But can they survive us? Does it matter? Once you read Ms. Payne's sensitive account of the elephants of Africa and the people who study them, the survival of these giants will matter as never before."
1,Not the real deal.,"I played on the original sessions of this album for Atlantic, and this album is not even remotely the same. Not even the same songs! Simon Phillips played on all the tracks I worked on. Jeremy then went to L.A. and had re-recorded my bass parts with Jason overdubbing my tracks, he did a great job.The original was o.k., this release is pretty bad. I'm disappointed."
2,only worth if for a song or two,in the summer of 79 i fell in love with the breezy tune ''cool breeze'' and have been pining for it ever since. i finally ordered this cd and the song still sounds good. the other songs dont fare as well. except for ''flee'' and ''travelin''' which are nice adult/contemporary tunes. the first three songs sound like jeremy was trying to duplicate bob welch's success but instead sounds like bad leif garrett i just dont think this album would have even sounded good back in 79. even without knowing his fleetwood mac or blues roots.
1,Wholeheartedly agree!,"Sorry I even got sucked into this one. Only track worth anything to me is Travelling (the last song)!Sorry you all wasted your money. I wasted a whole lot too, and time involved in it! A big lesson learned!"
2,Early 80's music,"Not quite what I had expected, but since I am a great fan of Jeremy Spencer, I wanted this album for my collection."
3,My Dad Is On This ALbum,"He wrote the 1st song.The problem with this record is the cult Jeremy was in (same one I was raised in), and they had enough control over it, well; the musicians were also in so the vibe was not as ""black"" and bluesy.If that makes sense."
1,SPENCER MEETS ABBA,"IF YOU THINK YOU ARE BUYING A FLEETWOOD MAC BLUES INFLUENCED CD,YOUR WRONG.WHAT IN FACT WE HAVE HERE IS A WEAK ATTEMPT AT DUPLICATING THE ABBA,BEE GEE'S,COMMERCIAL ZONE.IT DOES NOT WORK....A RE-ISSUE OF MATERIAL THAT WAS BEST LEFT IN THE VAULT.SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
2,Try Baltsa or Mignes Johnson,"There are three other Carmens on DVD and all of them are better than this one. Even better is the Karajan that was released on laser and will perhaps make it to DVD. If you insist on Maria Ewing get her other one.The staging is not misguided and I think the singing and her supporting cast is better. I prefer Carreras and Baltsa and Ramey and the Metropolitian Opera who give a great performance. The movie with Raimondi and Mignes Johnson and Domingo and is terrific. Both also have great Michaelas. Both of these DVD's also provide French as well as English subtitles,and wouldn't it be nice if original language subtitles were available for all opera DVD releases. They all CAN do it but they all don't because they are just not willing to put in the little bit of extra effort that makes the difference. 2 stars instead of 1 just out of respect for the music. Better to have this Carmen than no Carmen."
5,Best Production of Carmen EVER!!!,"I kept checking this out of the library, so I finally just ordered my own copy. This is a fabulous production of Carmen. Maria Ewing is so spectacular...as a Mezzo AND as an actress. First of all, she looks like a gypsy. Her eyes are remarkable...you can see them bulge and glare, even on a long shot. She is just so brazen and sensuous and sullen...and she does great little theatrical ""business"" gestures, like picking lint off her dress. She's Carmen as a woman in charge. Everybody else is fabulous, too. The tempo is upbeat. The theatre is in the round. And there are lots of surprises!"
3,brilliant and magical artwork,"I saw this video when I was a child, and it is absolutely brilliant (and practically seamless) stop-motion puppetry and extremely creative and beautiful storytelling. The Pied Piper is the first of the two stories and has a narration along with the action-- But I was actually very disappointed that the Cinderella story had no verbal narration or dialogue- only a (admittedly lovely) musical score. Otherwise it is a marvelous and UNIQUELY magical film worth seeing."
4,PIAA 15660 H4,Better light only I think I need to rewind stator to be able to use all of the watts. Good white light color.
1,Blah.,"Bad story/plot, dialogue -- very bad, acting...not even bad enough to qualify as so bad it's good. You are likely to laugh at some moments of unintentional humor, but nothing you'll want to ever waste time watching again. Perhaps if they would have fleshed out an actual story and plot and cut all the senseless dialogue that has the characters bantering worthless words and did something about the acting (different actors and/or more rehearsal time), this could have been something. It was like filming an early draft of a bad script."
1,Beware,Don't be fooled by the two five-star reviews on here (as I was). They both are obviously connected to the movie in some way. The other one-star review pretty much says it all. I just wanted to chime in and save another unsuspecting victim from having to sit through this excruciatingly bad movie.
1,This is the first edition,This is the first edition basically useless don't buy save your money hopefully you have a smart phone or you can find an up to date map book as they are no longer making them
5,Very Handy for Small Groups,"I first watched this video on VHS tape borrowed from my church library then I bought this DVD from Amazon. Owning this on DVD is very handy for using it in a small group for discussion. There may be other resources that are more detailed and in-depth in the topic of ""ape-man"" evolution. But I found this one most useful as it has covered some of the most famous ape-man fossils in less than 30 minutes, thus leave time for group discussion. It also interviewed some of the most famous authors, scientists and theologians in this field from both sides of the debate. Some further reading on this topic may be even more helpful. I found it helpful reading ""Bones of Contension"" by Marvin Lubenow, who is also interviewed in this video."
3,Brittle,"The erasers fit my Zebra M-301 pencil just fine, but the eraser itself is made of a different material than the stock eraser. It is brittle and my first one snapped at the top after about a day or two of regular use."
4,could have been better,It took a while to receive the erasers and I'm glad to have them but the rubber is harder than the original one and seems to smear the pencil until you go over it several times.
4,Moses wasn't Fat,I found this book very insightful - educational and I recomend it to anyonewho is health concious and wants to maintain good health
4,Betrayal,"A unique story that is told backwards, each scene followed by another from earlier in the story. An unusual format. Betrayals are made even more aggregious when you know what will come later. Irons and Kingsley are superb in this gripping tale of betrayal."
2,An ok movie,"This movie was ok I guess, the boy was a little hick though! :) Kind of sad, kind of sappy-bad actors. I guess the horses were beautiful though, so that at least deserves some stars. I wouldn't recommend rushing out to buy it though, it's not the best movie in the bunch thats for sure!"
2,Please call the vet,"The horse gets sick, the kid gets sick. Not much before or after. It's fun to see a young Roddy McDowall as the kid, but his character is a limp noodle. If you are looking for a family alternative to the action, shoot-'em-up movies, forget this one and try My Neighbor Totoro."
4,My Friend Flicka,"This is an all-time classic horse movie. Along with the others in the series which I am trying to get such as""Green Grass of Wyoming"" and ""Thunderbolt;Son of Flicka"" but unfortunately not having much luck. They are all excellent movies not only do I expereince laughter but also a few tears to a not so emotional person. I think it is movies like this one that will never cease their popularity, it would just be nice if they were played more often then what they are. I am in my 20s and I love many of the new movies, but My Friend Flicka will always be a childhood fav."
3,Great But Sound Is A Dissapointment,"The movie itself is good quality but at some parts in the movie the sound is terrible, either to soft or too loud. You have to keep on switching volumes to hear.Otherwise a good purchase."
2,Awesome horses - less than awesome actors,"Sorry, but I just cannot get past Roddy McDowall's English accent. He's supposed to be a Wyoming rancher's son, yet he speaks like a Brit. No one else in the entire movie speaks like a Brit so it comes off as really annoying. It ruins the whole movie for me.PS - I love Roddy in nearly everything else I've ever seen him in - especially ""How Green Was My Valley"""
4,Flicka hits close to home,"Well, owning a horse named flicka, i figured it was my deauty to read/watch it, luckly it wasnt wasted time, i found it heart worming cinderella story, although the tear jerker parts ripped my heart out."
4,Classic but....,"This classic film from the 40's has a lot going for it; great scenery, realistic approach to the story, and captures the period well. However, the main character played by Roddy McDowell is wimpy and effeminate. Perhaps the fact that the writer and subsequent screen writer were women has something to do with this? Personally, I think the story works better with a girl in the lead role. This is exactly what the remake ""Flicka"" does, and it works much better."
3,"OK movie, beautiful horse","The movie is just OK - definitely a kids movie, but people who just love horses will enjoy watching this beautiful horse."
5,Flicka Family Classics Collection,Great Grandmother wanted my great neice and nephew to see the Flicka Classics Collection. The children are 5 and 3 years old and have watched each of the three movies included in the collection several times. They play act the scenes all the time while playing. The collection was great. Lessons learned are unforgettable.
1,Poor Quality Control,"Product was impossible to open without breaking the CD case. Why can't these folks figure out how to make a product that is easier to open? The music is 5 stars, of course."
1,"CHEAP, DONT SUGGEST",PIECE OF S***T. TURNED IT 5 OR SIX TIMES AND WHOLE CENTER POKED OUT. EXPECTED TO BE WELL BUILT BUT WASNT. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. NOT FLAT LIKE PICTURE BUT GLOSS. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.
1,"Cheap, fake image (photoshopped)","Very poor quality, glossy and cheap looking.The images of the knob are completely computer generated - photoshopped - not actual photos at all."
5,Such a great series,"If you have watched the anime series, then you will want to continue with the manga. I've read the manga (online) a few years ago when I finished the anime and just had to find out what happened.I stumbled across the print version at Borders. From there I knew I had to get the entire manga collection. They are reasonably priced and well worth it.If you are squimish, then this manga isn't for you. For the rest of the world - this is a must have."
1,Graphic SF Reader,"This didn't interest me at all, unfortunately. Some ultraviolent characters, where you are not quite sure what is going on, who they are, why they are doing it, or where they are trying to get to. After that, there was little to interest me. Maybe for fans of androgyny in art?"
3,Was OK,"It was OK. The quality of picture could have been better. Having said that, it brought back alot of nice memories from when I was younger. It would have been a 4 or 5 star except for that."
3,For Christmas,Kids get a chance to visit this wonderful Storyland and hear some of the traditional music associated with the season. Introduces little ones to this magical story and the Nutcracker.
2,A little Boring,My daughter loves the carebears but this movie is a little boring. Normally I cant drag her away when there on but this one she loses interest real fast.
1,"""I have never been so scared in my life""","This has nothing to do with Nutcracker. Some parts were similar to Lord of the Rings (mice slave toys and burn the Toyland) and others similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark. My 6-year old daughter said: ""I have never been so scared in my life."" Definitely not suitable for young children."
2,"Cute idea, terrible quality","Amazon did a great job with shipping and packaging, so this review is in no way meant to be critical of them, just the product. The characters are adorable, and the story of the Nutcracker is told in a unique way (though there are some scary parts, even for my 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 year olds, which probably could have been portrayed in a bit different way). Sadly, the quality of the visual experience is absolutely terrible. Grainy, sometimes disjointed; pretty bad animation to begin with, but even that may be forgiven were it clear and sharp. Neither is true, unfortunately. Would not recommend."
5,Carolyn Kaut Roth,"This book is a must for any MRI technologist.Carolyn Kaut Roth explains things in ""english"" so you understand.If you have ever been to her confrences you know what I am talking about. If you have never been, I suggest you go even if you are not an MRI tech, she is GREAT!"
3,returned book,"I returned this book because it was not quite what I was looking for, and I had to return it to a third party company. I returned to the book depsitory in the UK on the 12th of november and still have not received confirmatiion that they have received it on the 26th. I don't want to do business with a third party again, I should be able to return merchndise to amazon."
1,Great Book-Worst Seller,"This book is great for the information, but I will never purchase from this seller again. Purchased on 4/17, email received shipped 4/18, received another email on 5/2 stating I would receive in a few days. By 5/8 still not received. I sent three different emails and could not get answers, when and where shipped from. I finally received the book 3 1/2 wks after purchase, and the book shipped from South Bend, IN to OK. It doesn't take 3 1/2 wks. even by pony express!"
3,"Some great ideas, but just not enough.","I though this book had some nice ideas for a few page layouts, however, there are not 200 designed scrapbook pages as the book says it does. There are not even 200 pages in the book. Some of the designs would take so much time, there wouldn't be time to take the pictures. I don't know of anyone who has that much time on their hands. I want to create a scraobook that is fun to look at, but did not take three years to make. I was looking foward to a book with a ton of pictures to give me a lot of ideas and I did not get that. I thought this book had too many words and not enough page layouts."
1,Not sized to attach to wall studs,"I hadn't realized that the screw holes on this are distanced 24 inches apart. Most wall studs are 16 inches apart, making it impossible to attach this rack to wall studs, as required.Maybe there is some way around this, but my husband and I are not the handiest people. I'm returning the rack and trying to find one more logically made. I plan on hanging a full set of All-Clad pots on it, so it needs to be attached safely to the wall.It's a shame, because it's a nice looking piece."
3,"It's Montblanc, for goodness sake!","I bought a Montblanc pen not because it was practical but because I thought it said something about me. Yes, the refills run out quickly, but that has always been the case with the Montblanc rollerballs pen. You could buy a lifetime supply of Bics for one Montblanc. We got what we paid for: they write incredibly smoothly, so live with it. The mediums last much longer than the fine points, BTW."
1,Drys out at the drop of a hat,"Have to agree with the previous reviewer. These Montblanc refills run out at the drop of a hat. I have both the black and blue versions and both of them have run out after 3 days or so of use. At first I thought it was just clogged with paper debris or an air bubble, but after several minutes of trying, the ink just will not flow again.These refills come with a little plastic end cap on them. I think you might need to store the refills (even the ones you are using in a pen) with the caps on in order to stop this dry out problemm but that's a ridiculously impractical solution. You might as well buy a cheap ballpoint pen."
2,I agree with the other two guys.,"I am glad I bothered to read the reviews .I agree with the assertion that MB just makes cheap refills.I went trough a set of two refills in less than a year.Mind you,I only use it to write checks and for the last six months I've been struggling to issue checks until the irritation just got to me.""So now what"" I say ? Live with that ! I can't really say I will throw the beautiful pen away.besides,writing checks is going the way of casettes,so how many refills will I need ?"
4,Great product.,I have just started a business and needed several contracts printed in duplicate forms. I did not want to go to the expense of ordering 500+ copies of each type of form. These worked nicely as a substitute for the print house forms.
1,Creature Of The Night,plain bore with no redeeming values at all unless you enjoy listening to demonic barks or watching dog attack training techniques for fun
2,BAD INVENTORY MANAGEMENT,THIS PRODUCT AND THE HORSERADISH I ORDER BOTH (CASES) WERE WITHIN 15 DAYS OF OF THEIR EXPIRATION DATE. THE HORSERADISH HAD NO TASTE. CASES SOLD TO INDIVIDUALS SHOULD HAVE SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE EXPIATION. THIS IS BAD INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. I NORMALLY DON'T READ DATES BUT THESE JUST DIDN'T TASTE RIGHT. THEN I CHECKED.
5,none,this was avaiable at the store. but they quit carrying it so i seen it on amazon and bought qne case i like the sweet taste the pricr was right and intend to buy more
5,Loud and sophmoric - just how rock and roll should be,"There is no substitute for the Ghettobillies live show. Raucous, jubiliant, profane and alcohol soaked, these four have more fun than ought to be allowed banging out their tunes and feeding off the audience. Although not a live CD, Still in the Pink comes close to capturing that energy. From the opening groove of Hiding Out to the show closing One of Us, this is the best CD I've ever heard by an unsigned band."
1,Don't waste your money - a very bad book,"Don't waste your money. This is some of the most unorganized, poorly commented code I've ever seen. Some of the code is in German! The book is in English so silly me, I expected the code to be use English words for variable and function names. An example of their lack of attention to detail is the first example in the book (circumcircle) is not even in try.cpp. Yes, I fixed the example myself, but this is an example of the author's sloppiness. How about file names like a.cpp, b.cpp, c.cpp, etc! This was an ... waste of time for me."
4,Don't expect a miracle...,"The concept of Recipies 1-2-3 is intriguing: recipies with only 3 ingredients (water, salt, and pepper not included). In many ways, this simplifies recipes. However, the tradeoff is that cooking techniques or unique ingredients (e.g. tahini) are often substitutes for creating flavor, which may challenge some readers. The book also offers tips for adding ingredients to improve the dishes, complete menus using recipes from the book, and helpful wine pairings. I will probably check out Rozanne Gold's other books in the future."
5,Excellent book! Ideal for new and experienced Outlook users.,"This book provides an extensive coverage of the features of Outlook 2000. Everything from basic (and more advanced)Contact Management and e-mail to Net Folders, publishing Free/Busy time, printing, using the Journal, File and folder management, integration with the rest of Office 2000 and customizing Outlook 2000 to suit your needs is covered. Peppered with humour, I found the book very easy and enjoyable to read. The exercises and examples are clear and very easy to follow. Keep a copy handy at both work and home. The extra time on your hands after learning to use Outlook 2000 from this book might be needed when you become a source of knowledge on Outlook 2000 for your friends and colleagues."
1,very poor company poor customer service,"I was once a owner of a clip hangar with a lifetime warranty. They changed their policies and when my clip hangar broke they would do nothing. This company has very poor customer service, and does not stand behind their product. The item costs pennies to produce they charge a lot and then change their policies. BE AWARE BEFORE YOU PURCHASE"
1,"Good product, not long lasting","I bought my second clip hanger after using a new one for the second year. Each broke within one year of service. Duh, who keeps receipts? I enjoyed the convenience, had the clip on my dashboard. I wish there was no ""warranty"" or else I am now feeling cheated. Just explain that plastic wears in heat and cold. And viola, you may need to order a new one in one year!"
1,Ceased to work properly after 10 months,"I really feel like I wasted my money. The unit stopped being able to record from the TV after about 10 months - when I noticed it was too late to claim on the warranty. What a waste of money at a time when no one needs to be wasting money. A great disappointment of a purchase. I am sick every time I think about it.Still, I can continue to dub VHS tapes to DVD, but I am quickly running out of old VHS tapes to copy. Now what?"
2,Should have listened to the other reviews,"I should have paid more attention to the other reviews. This has got to be the most complicated vcr/dvd I have ever owned. It does take FOREVER to do anything, even turn on. Plan on having 15 or 20 minutes to get everything set up if you want to watch a movie or record anything. I finally was able to figure out how to use it and it does do a good job of recording and playback, although vcr playback isn't great. You have to use three remotes in order to playback or record anything and I am afraid to even try to set up a timed recording. I have not attempted that yet. Overall, I really don't like this product and would not recommend it."
2,sorry i purchased,i am very disappointed with this product. the player was unable to play a disc previously recorded. the sound control is poor. the recorder is not user friendly. i wish i had purchased it locally so that i could return it.
2,Review purchase,"Everything was fine as far as the prompt delivery, etc., but the product leaves something to be desired (Toshiba DVD Recorder/VCR Combo. D-VR600, However I am keeping it because I don't have the energy to return it."
3,Xam Math 9-12: So-So,"I wouldn't say I've found a better book anywhere else for this task.I did read through it and I easily passed the NYS CST for Math, but I feel the book's organization is rather weak. It looks like it was very hurridly put out. And I found several real math errors in it, which shows the proofreading was pretty weak.It's a fairly expensive book, and I expected a lot better product for the price. Still, there isn't much competition in this area for review products, so it still may be something you want to purchase. I took the math test after being out of college (engineering) for almost 25 years, and needed a quick review, so I felt it was right for me."
1,Good for topical review BUT too many typos / errors!,"This book was helpful, especially for someone who had been away from the subject for a while ... as it gives you a good idea of range of topics. (Though it should include a section on transformations, rotations, etc. in geometery).BUT definitely needed more proofreading, at least the version I used in the Spring, 2004. Many errors and even a problem that switched log and exp functions! (Too quick to rush to market maybe?). So if you use it... watch for this.Book could also use more exercises."
4,Great radio for the mountains,These radios are great for trips to the ski slopes. I've used them to talk to family members skiing or snowboarding on other parts of the mountain. Definitely worth the money.
3,"Not bad, but.....","A pretty decent book on gardening in confined spaces. There are a lot of useful tips and ideas that are presented throughout. However, the book in my opinion is poorly illustrated, which is somewhat strange for a gardening book. The illustrations are sketches with no color, doesn't give you that feel I think one looks for in a gardening book."
3,"A Quick Read, Could Use More Illustrations","I ordered this after discovering that the Meat Cake Compilation is practically out of circulation. I'd say this is a nice little introduction to Dame Darcy, but I was hoping for more of a graphic novel or comic layout-- where as this is more like a storybook, with pictures appearing on pages of text.The stories are simple and you can tell what her favorite words are because she tends to re-use them again and again... this shows her style off well, but I almost hoped for a more expanded vocabulary or just a greater variety of words.All in all, not bad, but it makes me all the more interested to read the Meat Cake series to see how they differ.SPOILER FOLLOWSAll of the stories, however, have happy endings, which honestly was not what I expected."
5,Fantastic,"I have know Danny for 5 years and would like to say this CD is one of his best. He put his heart and soul into this album and the love for his family and for God truely shines through. If you have not listened to this CD, take my word and buy it, it will be the best CD you will ever buy! Good Job Danny!"
1,Great!,"I would like you to buy this CD to clean your mind. Frankly to say , best of buying I had ever bought,indeed."
5,Cute cuddly kitty,I am an older adult female. My cat is old and will probably not live much longer. I got this toy cat because I won't be getting another cat. This one is fine. It's well made and I can pet it and hold it just fine. Nice product.
2,kind of creepy,"I do not like this thing! It reminds me of that toy in the TV ad where the family really wants to get the thing out of there. The eyes, which some have described as beautiful, to me, look demented and pretty scary. Its little mouth is red and open, as though ready to take little nips out of me while I sleep. The fur is kinda ratty and I did not care for the texture and feel. I replaced it with an Aurora calico kitty, much more to my liking. Also, keep in mind that it is a puppet, so it is not really fully stuffed. I also had a lot of issues with the company, Folkmanis, which I guess were not allowed in a product review. Anyway, I returned it as fast as I could, despite being a major cost to me."
2,PUPPET- not a stuffed toy,"This is a PUPPET, so if you want just a stuffed animal this is NOT it. The product should have included the word PUPPET in it's name."
1,Not what I was expecting,"The photo makes this look like an adorable stuffie. I was certain my cat-crazy little one would love it. As it turns out, this is a puppet, not a standard stuffed animal. Also, it may just have been mine, but both my husband and I found the face and eyes to be rather ""off"" which made the cat's demeanor creepy rather than cute. Couldn't wait to pack it in the box and return it."
1,Folkmanis Puppet Ragdoll Cat,The hand only goes into the head and I can barely get my hand in. It looks cuter in the picture. I plan to return it.
4,Sigma macro review,"This is a great lens. We've taken some great shots of flora and fauna with it, also a few sports shots. Image rendition is excellent. We use it on Canon 30D and 40D bodies. It focuses quickly and without a lot of noise. We have no complaints at all with this lens."
5,Excellent lens,"This lens can get you within about 3"" of a tiny subject and affords stunning detail, even with the 12 mp limitation of my Pentax K-r. If you're ordering a macro lens, you already know what it's for - this one will do the job brilliantly. At 70mm it's a little long for some applications, especially on an APS-C camera, (which brings your field of view down to the equivalent of a 105mm lens.) But in most all situations that's just fine and gives you a little breathing room with small, live subjects. If you're using it to double as a portrait lens, this one might be too big - they also make a 50mm in the same high quality EX series that might be better suited. (There's also a true 105.) The specs are outstanding - this is a very bright, high quality, low-distortion lens. Only complaint: the auto-focus can get confused in lower light situations, more so than happens with my shorter kit lens. (18-55) But some of these shots are best handled with manual focus anyway."
4,Sharp macro lens,"Sigma 70mm F/2.8 EX DG Macro Lens for Nikon Digital SLR CamerasVery satisfied with the sharp photos. The autofocus works well and I like the focus limit feature as allowing the lens to search the entire focus range for each shot requires several seconds. Easy switching from manual to autofocus, but no focus touchup. I get a little vibration during focusing if the camera is held at a certain angle. Overall, for the money this is an excellent lens."
4,Great Lens for a Great Price with a few caveats,"I purchased this lens about three months ago so I've had plenty of time to give it a thorough testing.Pluses:- this lens gives me nice sharp pictures from f/2.8 to around f/18- great soft bokeh at f/2.8- unlike the reviewer of June 2009, my lens DOES shoot at f/2.8 even when I am 2-3 inches from a subject at 1:1 macro- very solid construction. I had the lens roll off of my fanny pack about 4 inches to a gravel surface. Didn't bother it at all.- no perceptible lens creep (even pointed vertically down)unlike my Tamron 18-250.- nice price (I paid $439.00)Minuses:- the weird screw on lens hood!!! Sigma needs to really rethink this design.- the need to move my position not zoom the lens (oops! that's a minus on me for being too used to zoom lenses)On the strength of this lenses pluses, I am considering purchasing, at least, one other Sigma lens in the near future.I am a semi-professional shooting on a Canon 40D (soon to be 5D Mark II)"
4,Long and Heavy,"The Sigma 70mm 2.8 lens gets an excellent review at [...] for its optics and image quality, and I think the 70mm focal length works well for close-up flower photos. I returned this lens only because I found it too long and heavy to keep steady while used with my monopod for garden and wildflower shots (it weighs 1.2 pounds). I just don't find it practical to use a tripod on hikes in the hills.If I buy another marco lens I'll probably go with the Canon EF-S 60mm f/2.8 USM for my Canon EOS Rebel XSi, which is significantly lighter and shorter."
3,Macro With Exceptions,"I must qualify my review by stating that shoot macro lenses in manual. I shoot flowers. I never goto 1:1. I'm using it on a Nikon D80 and a Nikon D300.The Sigma 70 is a nice lense. It's well built. It handles well. Color is acurate and contrast is good. My only issue with this lens is it is not sharp at F18 to F22 which is common amoung many macros. If I stay at F16 with moderate magnification then it stays sharp. As a matter of fact its shrpness at normal magnification is identical to the Sigma 50mm macro and Tamron 90mm macro. When I want higher magnification I goto a longer lens which is why I have 50mm, 70mm, 90mm and 105mm macro.If you want to do macro work at less than 1:1 and you stay away from F18 and F22 then this lens will work fine. I gotten some great shots with it."
2,Disappointed with the Sigma,"Optically the Sigma 70mm macro was a decent lens for macro, but not a good all purpose lens at all. The build quality really turned me off. I tried the Tamron 90 macro, better build quality, better optices for both macro and general use. Decided on the Nikon 105 micro with vibration reduction. About 300 bucks more but a world apart in build quality and optics. A truly professional lens. In fairness though, I have to say that for the money, the Tamron was OK."
3,The first book was A LOT better.,I don't know if the author has children but the words and thoughts she gave the 7 year old were way off. Many times I had to stop and roll my eyes. Anybody who has had a 7 year old or is around them all the time like I am will know what I'm talking about.This book was just okay for me.
2,This story is a fake!,"I live in MA and on MyFoxBoston.com today it was reported that the author admitted that the story was fake and she isn't even Jewish!Quote from MyFoxBoston.com: ""BOSTON (FOX25, MyFoxBoston) -- Author Misha Defonseca of Dudley is causing quite a stir, after admitting that she made up her international bestselling book ""Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years.""Here is the URL copy and paste to see the video report:http://www.myfoxboston.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail?contentId=5909557&version;=2&locale;=EN-US&layoutCode;=VSTY&pageId;=1.1.1What a sad pathetic thing to do and what a slap in the face to everyone who lived through and suffered the holocaust. This author is a hack and should be outed as such. I am tired of people playing on the emotions of others to make money and gan fame. The news reported that this book has been translated into 18 different languages and is now going to be made into a movie in France. God have Mercy on this author for making up this story!"
1,Unbelievable,"I've known for years that this book had been exposed as a fraud by several enterprising forensic genealogists.But I recently read the work anyway. It's quite well written, as faked stories go. All the same, it is hard to understand how anyone could ever have believed this story --- much less the Holocaust victims who wrote blurbs for the book jacket before it came out. And how the book was published in 18 languages is beyond me.The entire story --- of a 7 year old Jewish girl leaving her safe house in Brussels, wandering across Europe in search of her parents, and surviving in part with the aid of wild wolves --- is just incredible. That is, unbelievable.My copy cost only a few cents on a remainder pile. But it's worth even less."
3,One Thing Is True,"I met Misha and read her book several years ago. Misha felt Jewish because she had shared the fate of Jews: her parents were murdered by the Nazis and she was raised as an outsider. From the begining, it was clear that the story was the false memory of an injured psyche. But there is an essential truth in the story; wild animals would have been safer companions than the Nazis and their collaborators."
1,AUTHOR CONFESSES HER STORY IS FAKE,"This is a fascinating story. But it's not a true story. The author finally admitted that she made it all up. The truth is after the author's parents, non-Jewish resistance fighters in Belgium, were arrested in World War II, she moved in with some relatives who treated her as a traitor. This made her ""feel Jewish"" and she made up her story to feel better about herself. A shame, an insult and an affront to all those Jewish people who truly suffered. (But nonetheless quite a moneymaker for the author who, before her confession, got a judge to award her tens of millions of dollars from the publisher for unpaid profits from the book.)"
2,"A touching story, but is it all true?","The recent allegations against the truthfulness of Binjamin Wilkomirski's ""Fragments"" should make us hesitate to accept this story as completely nonfictional. It is hardly surprising that a tragedy of the magnitude of the Holocaust will inspire some accounts which are either fabricated or embroidered in ways that will appeal to a wide public. It is not impossible that Misha Defonseca survived alone in the woods, but improbable that she was adopted by wolves as she claims. There are much better books for people who want to know what happened to children in the Holocaust. I recommend books by Eva Kor, Magda Denes, Cordelia Edvardson and Livia Jackson."
1,It's not true...,"This is not true... even the author has admitted it...Almost nothing Misha Defonseca wrote about herself or her horrific childhood during the Holocaust was true.She didn't live with a pack of wolves to escape the Nazis. She didn't trek 1,900 miles across Europe in search of her deported parents, nor kill a German soldier in self-defense. She's not even Jewish.Defonseca, a Belgium writer now living in Massachusetts, admitted through her lawyers this week that her best-selling book, ""Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years,"" was an elaborate fantasy she kept repeating, even as the book was translated into 18 languages and made into a feature film in France.""This story is mine. It is not actually reality, but my reality, my way of surviving,"" Defonseca said in a statement given by her lawyers to The Associated Press.""I ask forgiveness to all who felt betrayed. I beg you to put yourself in my place, of a 4-year-old girl who was very lost,"" the statement said."
2,You should refund all money,"I found this book at the library yesterday after I heard the news (I wanted to see it without paying for it). I read through a lot of it to get the sense of what the book was about, and I am stunned that it has taken this long for the truth to come out. Yeah, it's a fascinating story, but come on people.The people who bought this book should be given a full refund of their purchase in the same way they would be given a refund if they bought a box of cereal and opened it up to find potato chips. After the author and publisher give back all the money, they should then sell the rights to the true story to Hollywood; this entire story sounds like Pan's Labyrinth: a young girl in the most terrible of times escapes through her imagination into a fairytale of her own."
4,Unique and Inspiring!,"What a fabulous story. I stayed up half the night to finish the book. This would be an excellent book for pre-teens and up --except for one half page where Misha witnesses a rape in the woods. It is far less graphic than a lot of evening TV. I would still recommend it for ""required reading"" lists- just giving a heads's up for parents/teachers. I read this book over a year ago and am leaving a review now because the book left such an impression on me."
4,Different but still great,"This album is quite different from say... Powerbait. Seems to me that the band put more time into the music..the songs are more elaborate then the previous albums. the result is a great Digger album, just as unique as the others. If you don't have a Digger cd yet, I'd get Powerbait first. Monte Carlo is still a great album though.."
4,Relive your geek days..,"I picked up this book and loved it, even though I am 21 years old. I suppose hindsight is really 20-20. Vizzini is a talented essayist with an endearing wit that most people will like. I read it and actually wanted to go back to high school!"
1,Only for the self-absorbed,"Nothing insightful or witty to be read in this book. The childish writing style could only entertain a true dullard and left me feeling talked down to. That being said, the WORST aspect is that the author would actually want to make a public record of his disgusting self-absorption."
4,Review courtesy of [...],"It's pretty cool because there are little mini-stories in the book. Each of them are interesting. I loved every one, but I have to say that my favorite story was Cable Access Says No. It's pretty funny because I was like, did he REALLY do that? It made me laugh so hard. But what's really cool about the book isn't just how funny it is, but that it is from when he was in high school--like me. I guess it's just pretty neat to see that even your favorite authors had to suffer through high school.Anyways, reviewing an autobiography is kind of tough for me because I hardly ever read them. If I were you, though, I would invest in this one. It's so good I want two copies. It's so good I want to punch a sheep, for no apparant reason except for how good this book is. It's so good that I want to end this blog post so that I can go read it."
3,Pretty disappointing,"I absolutely loved Be More Chill and It's kind of a Funny Story, but this was pretty boring, i don't just mean the content, the delivery and writing style felt a dry, there were some really interesting moments but not quite enough, and the story's ending was a too abrupt, the whole thing was just a bit of a bummer."
1,Battery Does not have a Brand Name and No Specs,The Product description does not match the product as I got. I don't even know what is the Power Specs
2,Effective?,"Nothing close to ""Effective C++"" ( as title might suggest tothose familiar).This doesn't imply, that the author doesn't know the subject:but the book isn't good.Wordy. Little code.Not worth a place on your shelf.Hope there won't be ""More effective Java""."
3,A decent book that didn't live up to it's title ...,"This book can't really seem to find a target audience. It jumps around giving advice about how to comment in one section, and then talks about cache coherency in multiple processor environments in other sections. So after being a recent Computer Science graduate, I found that about 35% of the material was useful or interesting."
2,Good book...,"Too bad Peter Haggar already wrote the same exact thing a year-and-a-half ago. See: Practical Java, Peter Haggar, Addison-Wesley, 1999, ISBN 0201616467"
4,Lots of great nuggets,Josh Bloch gives great insight into best practices that really can only be discovered after years of study and experience. The idea being that you won't make the same mistakes that he and others made during their tenure designing the Java APIs.
5,Like buying a couple years of experience,"Bloch apparently has ties to Gosling the creator of Java which explains his depth of knowledge of this Language. We all develop many practices with different languages that experience teaches us is the thing to do but we never found these practices in books (or seldom). This entire book is ""this is how you should do this"" or ""This is the language you don't read about in the books"". Very good stuff."
5,Can't praise it highly enough,"It's rare that a book really cuts to the nitty-gritty of good software design in a practical, immediately usable way. This is such a book. It doesn't have a lot of high-concept baggage. Rather, think of it as a sort of Strunk-and-White for Java programming. Each item reminds me of something like Strunk's""Concise writing is vigorous""-style aphorisms, with examples that are to the point and illustrative. From the utility of immutables to the best practices for enumerated types, this book talks about what just about any programmer will encounter very quickly in his professional development and throughout his career.It's also the kind of book one can open at random and find useful information.Effective Java Programming Language Guide belongs on the shelf of every serious professional programmer, whether beginner, intermediate, or Java guru."
5,Absolutely the best Java book I've read,"This book is the best resource I've encountered for someone who knows the Java language, but wants to master its use. I can virtually guarantee that the rules and techniques covered in ""Effective Java"" will form the new foundation on which you will build the rest of your best practices for writing excellent Java code.Written by the Joshua Bloch, the acknowledged expert on the subject, it is as authoritative as they come and extremely well-written. After seven years as a senior developer architecting and implementing algorithms and class libraries in Java (and another 6 years using other languages before that), this book shocked me by summarizing much of what I knew about how to use the language effectively, while teaching me much that I did not know. It continues to top my recommended reading list for all new software developers at my company."
4,Good but a little outdated.,"Good book, but a little outdated.Surely it's a must if you program in Java (but the same applies to all the books on improving programming languages), it is not enough to know the syntax of a language to know how to program in that language."
5,Still Effective,"With so many reviews on this book, I will put it short.Java language has been evloved and adopted significantly since its debut in 1995, a lot of features have been added to enrich and enhance it. But the advices in this book are still and will be held solid.Some of these advices are design principles not specific to Java but shown how to Java to realize, others are the core fundation of the language itself.Also the book lists some anti-pattern/principle codes made by author himself or other developers to alarm the reader to avoid such pitfalls."
5,A great mystery,"Chasing Shadows is a mystery that will compel you.Shelby gets a job at a restaurant. Then a waitress, Nadine, goes missing. This book will grip you as Shelby finds the clues that will lead to where Nadine is. Who took Nadine, and why? Read Chasing Shadows to find out. Chasing Shadows is a great installment to the Shelby Belgarden mysteries. I've read the other ones, and they are mysteries worth your while. I suggest reading every book in the series."
3,Color darker than my phone,Took longer to arrive than it said. Color is off from what I consider ivory. Color is darker than my phone.
2,Somewhat Useful,"This book is pretty outdated for the most part especially with much of the formatting that it uses. If you use this book you should make yourself aware of the new industry standards via AAMT Book of Style.However, this book is very good for learning or brushing up on your grammar skills, and it has some pretty helpful lists and things that you can pull out and place in a notebook."
3,Medical Transcription Techniques and Procedures,"Medical Transcription Techniques and Procedures with CD-ROM, Sixth EditionThis is my second Medical Transcription book that I've ordered from Amazon. The books are great,but it is the CD Rom that is difficult to work on the computer so that you can use it.The reason I bought the books are to use the CD Rom for practice and to keep up with my skills.But overall the book is a great study guide and I am sure that the CD Rom will be too."
3,"Lots of questions, but watch out for errors !","The best thing about this book was the volume of questions. There were quite a few errors in the book. They have an errata sheet posted on the web, but even the errata sheet had errors. All of the questions in the book will not be covered elsewhere in the book. The only time you will see some information in the book will be in the form of a question. Again, the best part about this book is the volume of questions it offers."
4,.,Some of the sheets had folded corners. BUt the book was new as was described and with all the pages
1,One Dimensional. Uninspiring.,"I won't recommend this for adult readers. The ""lessons"" are delivered in the narrative style. However, the characters are one-dimensional and I find it difficult to relate to them. The dialogues are contrived and leave a chemical taste, making the lessons hard to swallow. Lack of soul."
4,Servant leadership,Mr. Hunter has written a book which is easy to read and has a profound message. We truly lead according to the amount we serve others. The setting in a monastery giving leadership thoughts through a class discussion led by a retired business leader was simple but catchy.I recommend this book to those who want to be leaders and expecially those who need to look beyond their own interests.
5,Excellent Read- A must for all!,This was definitely a great read for anyone wanting to be a better leader in whatever capacity. I will never sell it back!
2,Didn't enjoy this,This was assigned to for a class I took. Its about a guy who goes and spends time examining himself at a religious retreat. Honestly I felt like it was hard to relate to and difficult to figure out the point.
4,The Servant: A Simple Story About The True Essence of Leadership,I found this an excellent exposition of leadership told in an engaging and entertaining way. It breaks down the principles that anyone can adopt to be a better leader in any family or business.
3,Not new Ideas,"This leadership ideas are not new, I have a leadership course about 20 years ago with the book principles, the thing is that you have to believe them to put them in practice and not always you can do that.As all the theories in paper this is very feasible, but to work with them is difficult for some people and easy for another, it is worth to try them at least one time."
4,Great book,I got this book for a class and it turned out to be a great book. Easy read and informative.
3,The Servant,"The message of this book is right on and it is extremely great information for front line managers all the way up to the CEO. If every company would abide by these golden nuggets of truth, employees would jump through hoops to ensure the success and longevity of their employers, which would in turn increase productivity and the bottom line. If only managerment the world over would get these concepts into their heads and really put them to work in their companies, this world would be a much better place.The down side of this book is the writing style. Yes, the scenario is a group of people in a class and it is largely filled with conversation. However, I think the author could have expanded his vocabulary within the conversations he wrote of over the seven days this book covers. It came to the point where I thought to myself: If he uses the phrase, ""Come to think of it..."" one more time, I AM GOING TO SCREAM!!!"
5,Amazon Book Ordering,Item being reviewedThe Servant: A Simple Story About the True Essence of LeadershipI needed 8 of these books quickly for a manager meeting and could not find any locally. I received all 8 in perfect condition within 3 business days. All for a reasonable price! Thanks Amazon!
1,A real loser,Priscilla Oppenheimer says it all. I couldn't wait to give my copy away. The phonetics chapter is such a disaster that I had to ask a friend to teach me phonetics! I hope that a publisher comes out with an alternative so the beginning linguistics students don't have to suffer anymore.
1,Linguistics,"This book is unimaginably boring and stupid. It is filled with cartoons and the text is redundant. What this text really amounts to is a class in common sense. I am a CS/Math major and had been led to believe that Linguistics was a real science, probably because Noam Chomsky teaches at MIT, but I discovered that it is actually a wretched humanity (U Chicago agrees) and that little could be gleaned from a text in such a muddled discipline such as this one. Don't make the mistake I made! Take Physics instead!"
3,its ok i guess,"Geeky guys that can play and sing? A few of the songs are good and folksy, but the rest of them seem to have the same boring sound. You might be better off buying the sound track to the movie."
2,The Best of the Proclaimers,"I bought this because it is where Celtic Thunder got their idea to record 500 Miles.Most of the Scottish Folk Songs are not entertaining to me, but I am glad I have the music.It is fun to hear the scottish accent."
4,REAL music,"As with The Beatles, Bruce Springsteen, The Clash and many more, I first heard '500 Miles' on the radio. In less than a minute I thought,""WHO are these giys...?!"" The song jumped out of my radio and my foot and butt were moving without giving it a thought...wow.REAL music--pure emotion, energy, and so needed in the world today, JOY, unabashed joy. The boys harmonies are so clean, their songwriting interesting and well crafted--except for a couple of duds (I never liked 'King of the Road'--even when it was a hit 40 years ago) the CD is packed with pretty songs and upbeat mood-changers. I bought it for '500 Miles' (the louder the better!)and have played that song at least once a day for the last week or so, but there gems all over this CD. You can't lose!"
5,Made in the USA,"Great coffee pot to have with you on your outdoor excursion. This coffee pot is light weight, easy to use and makes a delicious cup of coffee. We just bought it and used it this past weekend and are satisfied with product 100%."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this item. It is more like a camping kettle than something you use at home. Guess I should have taken more notice of the title. Anyway, it has been sent to the RV and I got a better one from Kmart for hubby to use in the house."
3,"Love the pot, but hate the leak...","I have purchased this pot two times as of this date. I had to return the first one due to a small constant drip that leaked from the handle rivets. The leak was constant in that it leaked whether the pot was hot or cold. Besides being annoying, it created a bit of a mess while the pot was heating on the stove. Figuring I had bought a defective unit, I returned the leaky pot and bought a replacement pot. Unfortunately, the new pot leaks slowly from the pot's same handle rivet area. With this replacement pot, the leak only occurs when the pot is hot from heating on the stove (metal expansion?). Obviously, Open Country has some quality control issues with leaks originating from the pot's handle rivets. The handle needs to be redesigned so that leaks will not occur. I love the pot and its size, however, a pot holding hot liquids should NEVER leak... period!!!"
4,Good for occasional use,"Took it camping for a few days. Worked well for something that will only get used once in a while. Heats up quickly, to include the handles. They are extremely hot by the time the coffee is ready. One great thing is that the pot keeps the coffee hot for a long time after you take it off the heat. We are satisfied with the purpose."
5,perfect for 2 Cups in the backcountry,"Good features for backpacking; handles fold flat, lid stays on securely while pouring, light but not so thin as to be flmsy. You can pack a small stove and fuel inside for transport. Infact the pot is a good size for an individual cooking pot.Remember that in the culinary world a 'coffee cup' is 6oz so be clear and use the unambiguous metric system, this will make about 890ml of coffee. Start at full flame till it stars to perk then turn flame down to the lowest which suppors perking for 5-10 minutes depending on taste.Great value at his price. highly recommended."
1,Language ruins this film,This may be a great movie but the language use absolutely ruined it for me. The Cree (characters) speak English and don't understand Cree and the white Canadians speak Cree and don't understand English.Here is how it works: A Cree chief meets a Canadian arm officer. The Cree chief (in the movie) speaks in English. The Canadian officer does not understand English. So his white interpreter (in the movie) translates the English into Cree. The officer replies in Cree which then has to be translated back into English so that the Cree chief (in the movie) can understand it.Apparently the whole movie is like this. I gave up after about 20 minutes. This absurdity absolutely ruined the movie for me.
3,great musicans,"i have seen these guys in person and the are great musicansthe album has lots of great music and house of the rising sun was #1 on the local radio station for several weeks.if you have never heard them you should give them a listen, they are worth it."
5,What's better than Carpenters and Amazon Prime?,I've been a Carpenters fan since the beginning and the Close to You CD was wonderful. It brought back so many memories. Thank you.
4,Good Music,"This was one of the first albums early in the Carpenters career, the hit We Only Just Begun is beautiful. Another interesting song is Crescent Noon, a song about the seasons! Not the greatest, but certainly a must buy for Carpenter fans. Good delivery time,and the c,d, was in great shape.James Mell"
5,Hear the music that started it ALL!!!!!,"For most people, this CD holds the music that started the Carpenters rise to stardom with the songs ""Close To You"" and ""We've Only Just Begun""!!! (There were other ""first"" albums...""Offering"" and ""Ticket To Ride"".)Hard to get that old vinyl version onto today's gadgets, so the option of a CD is nice = )TIMELESS, BEAUTIFUL...The Carpenters music will truly LIVE FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,How dare you send me an oudated Magenta cartridge,"I was very upset to see clearly labeled on the Magenta cartridge something like Use Before 11/2008. I had ordered this in Jan. 2009. When I called customer service, I was confused by the labeling of the different cartridges. So I called Brother who told me to return it. Somehow, Amazon decided to send me another black cartridge instead but I had already two black cartridges. I think you should send me a free magenta cartridge if you want me to be a customer. I returned the black cartridge. thanks for nothing since I still need to order a magenta cartridge from someone else who can be trusted."
4,Changi,"I have seen this first in the Hallmark Channel but never got to see all of it. It is an interesting depiction of the situation in the Japanese prisoner of war camp in Singapore during Woeld War 2. It is quite good, but can get dull at times."
2,Beauty and Power : Transgendering and Cultural Transformatio,"I felt this book gave a good understanding of the traditional versus modern life i the Phillipines. I felt this book could have been written better but it wasn't so, I only gave it 2 stars"
2,Ok if you want a quick read but...,"This book is fine if you want to see what's mainline academic today. However, it is a brief intro. If you need a scholarly text, go read Erhman's full NT intro. You must also read Donald Guthrie's NT Intro to obtain a balanced view of the subject."
4,Great tool for a project manager,"The 2007 version is more tightly integrated w/ Office, great tool for a project manager or someone that spends a lot of time on calls/meetings taking and organizing notes."
5,Most used part of office,"I had Office 2003 but never use onenote, I actually removed it cause it was never used. I moved to Office 2007 and I took it out again, till I was looking for a single place to take notes and tried Evernote and didn't care for it, its a great product, don't get me wrong. I installed OneNote 07 again and played with it and found it to be easy to use and it worked well with the rest of Office.I have been using it for a year now... I have it on both of my computers and the folders that contain each notebook is setup to be syncd from notebook to desktop and the other way around. I found a plug-in for Firefox that lets me pull website information easily, you can copy paste as well. I have a app for my ipod touch that lets me sync to it as well,so I have my notes with me.As you use this product you will use paper and pencil less and less. If I ever left Office, I would still buy this as a standalone, its that useful."
5,How did I ever live without it?,"Microsoft OneNote 2007Seriously folks - this is the best program ever. I'm an information junkie, and have a huge amount of notes from books and the internet. This program allowed me to put my notes all in one place. I can find things now! Notes do you no good when they're buried under more notes on your desk. My desk is clean, and I can reference anything anywhere, anytime all on my laptop now. Best money I ever spent. :o)"
5,OneNote 2007 a winner!,"I purchased Microsoft OneNote 2007 as an upgrade to OneNote 2003. The install went smooth. All my OneNote 2003 notes were imported into OneNote 2007 correctly. While I have not tried all the new features in OneNote 2007, the ones I have tried worked as expected. OneNote is a great tool for keeping notes. I use it keep notes on Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Photography, etc. techniques I find in books, magazines, etc. This have made finding a technique to use for a particular application much easier. I believe OneNote 2007 has earned a 5 star rating from me."
5,Excellent software for students,"The design is intuitive, the layout options on each page are flexible, and overall the software has done excellent things for my organization and productivity. I highly recommend it to students looking for a better way to keep notes for classes and writing projects."
5,Excellent,"Product was received rapidly, exactly as described. OneNote is an excellent utility for tablet PC users - much more sophisticated thatn Windows Journal, supporting much richer content collections."
5,The best kept secret in software,"Truly, the best kept secret in business software, changed my life right side up.Organizing issues is a pre-requisite for clear thinking. Stumbled upon this software a few months ago and now wonder how I ever managed without it! I work in multiple domains and information overload is a universal issue. So I bless the good Lord and the buddy who introduced me to this application every time I am trying to organize material.Very simply an electronic organizer with workbooks, section groups, sections, tabs and sub tabs, pages. Use them to organize your notes, emails, calendars, etc. into domains."
