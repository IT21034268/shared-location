3,"Better than most girl books, but didn't quite hit the mark.","I liked this book somewhat. For girls who are raised in the world and have extreme feminist roots, this book might be a good ice breaker, however, it doesn't quite teach what the Bible really has to say about becoming a Godly women. It definitely is better than ""A Young Women After God's Own Heart,"" which I feel is very feminized view of the Bible, but the best choice is ""So Much More."""
1,Cheap Rip-Off of the book Driving While Black,"A crudely written , self-indulging short story that should be in the fiction catagory. A rambling on collection of qoutes and supposed evidence taken out of context. Seems to be a troubled individual, jumping on a band wagon all the way from Atlanta to Chicago. If what this author says is true, she needs to learn how to write a book on a subject such as this, including opposing views and verifiable sources. You don't kill the flock to get to the wolves! I can't believe a publishing company actually spent the money on this, was there even an editor to do spell check? I'm glad I borrowed a copy instead of buying one. Now I know why its rated at number 1.5 million on the list. PS I didn't know the list went down that far."
1,do not agree,Ms. Harris has a tainted view of the US Customs Service. She violated the law and put numerous USCS employees in danger. Ms. Harris is seen by her co-workers as lazy and useless. Even the black female inspectors do not want to be associated with her. The US Customs Service has a difficult job protecting our nations borders. Employees like Harris waste a position that could be filled by a motivated worker. Do not believe this book.
1,Flying While Black,"This book is outrageous!! The author, this civil rights heroine, is nothing more than a hypocrite looking to cash in on the backs of others. She repeats many cases of abuse in this book and yet she not only wants to continue to work for this organization but work side by side with the people she accuses. The author is using this book to systematically take apart everything that our civil rights movement attempts to build...I guess you really don't think that it is that bad. If you do, how can you look at yourself in the mirror while putting on that uniform? Besides it is poorly written. Don't waste your money on this."
4,true punk,"Pride Bowl is a true punk band, they are nothing like blink 182, sum 41, and all the other MTV ""bad boy bands."" Their lyrics are meaningfull and their music is creative and original. They are truly a good band, up there in the ranks with NOFX. Any of their CD's are worth buying, especially ""The Soft Song"" not seen here."
4,"Grizzly H6143 2 1/2"" Finish Nailer",A solid product. I bought one of these nail guns a few months ago and it has performed nicely for nailing trim -- no jams or major problems. One odd thing is its smell; since the day it arrived it has had a strong chemical odor like that of freshly molded plastic which hasn't faded much in two months. I've been storing it in an open-air barn since having it inside for any length of time tends to stink-up the room or even the garage.
2,"Jammed nail, again jammed nail and again","Grizzly sells always non-expensive products. I do own couple of them. It is in fact: you get what you paid for. This nailer is classic example of Grizzly equipment. It does job somewhat, but so unreliable, heavy and Grizzly's trademark - non-elegant design.Can I fix this nailer in Grizzly service center? No, you cannot. Any Grizzly tool should be shipped back. Can you just image inconvenience and frustration when their tools operate poorly? Fortunately I don't own their chipy table saw."
1,Heartbreaking for 9 year old,"After desperately wanting a sewing machine, our 9 year old recieved this item on her birthday. She used it with my assistance one time and it broke. The bobbin will not thread, even after employing the assistance of 2 seamstresses. The product is cheap and the experience was very sad when you have a child who wants nothing more than to sew something for her mom.Everything I have ever read about this machine says the same. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I purchased 3 of these machines. Each one broke after 1 use. One of them only lasted 5 minutes. To top it off, AMAZON will not stand behind this product. After begging to return them, they only gave me partial credit. Simplicity states the warrantly lies with the seller and so now I am left without the 3 machines and I only received a credit of $46.98 for all three. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
3,Could go either way,"The first machine we recieved would not pick up the bottom thread. After contacting simplicity they said is sounded like a timing problem and because it was not a full size machine it was not repairable and to contact the seller. I requested an exchange from amazon and they immediately sent a new machine. I had to pay shipping to return the bad one, but the second one so far is working fine and threadng like it should. It is a simple machine to work and my two girls 6 and 9 learned how to run it quickly. I did however have to work fast to get it replaced and returned when the first one didn't want to work. I recommend the machine, just beware that it needs to be tested early because I think timing may be a common problem with these small machines."
5,Ghostbusters is a great soundtrack & CD!,"I think the soundtrack to the excellent movie Ghostbusters, is as good as the film. ""Ghostbusters"" by Ray Parker Junior is one of those songs that will never go away, especially around Halloween when many radio stations still play it. Other songs are good, but aren't as good. I can't remember off the top of my head some of the other good songs, but most of the others are good. What I find interesting with this CD is the instrumental version of Ray Parker Junior's song. It's just good even without him singing."
5,So totally reeking of awesomeness!,"I bought this CD last year and i tell you, it hasn't been out of my CD player since. The songs are so catchy, especially 'Cleanin' Up the Town' by the Bus Boys and 'In the Name of Love' by the Thompson Twins. And we can't forget the original and best 'Ghostbusters' by Ray Parker Jr. There are so many things right with this Cd, that I can only find one possible complaint which is that there are only ten tracks. But don't let this put you off buying as the CD lasts for about forty minutes. I mean it, this is a fabulous CD which belongs in your CD at home and believe me, if you ain't afriad of no ghosts then you shouldn't be without this!"
5,The Best Movie and SoundTrack ever made!!!,"I thought that Ghostbusters was the best movie ever made. I just bought the movie and i have watched it like a million times. I'm probably going to watch it again today... The soundtrack is just as good. If you don't have the Movie and soundtrack, get them NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The soundtrack to my childhood,"Being a child of the 80's I've seen this movie countless times. ""Savin the Day"" has been stuck in my head since I could crawl. ""Ghostbusters"" was even playing when my wife and I walked into our wedding reception. This CD will get a lot of playing time in my car stereo!"
4,Another great mystery from Beth Saulnier!,"This is Beth Saulnier's 5th installment in the Alex Bernier mystery series and yet another gem. Read the book and discover the twenty-something reporter/sleuth that is Alex living her life and getting herself into all sorts of predicaments - thanks to reporting and eventually self-investigating mysterious deaths at a music festival.Beth Saulnier again makes the most of referencing all sorts of Central New York area locales - something I really enjoy about her books, being a Central New Yorker myself. This novel is never boring and will keep you turning the pages to find out what can possibly happen next.I can't wait for the next installment! I thank a local book club for introducing me to Beth Saulnier!"
1,awful and repetitive,I read the first two books in this series and enjoyed the first one. I picked this one up at a book exchange in the library. It's time for this author to start a new series or write a novel comensurate to her growth as a person. Is she serious? Life is short.
4,"Exciting, but tacky ending","I always love Adventures in Odyssey, and this is no exception. That being said, I have a few comments.- The actor and actress who play Sam and Lucy are not very talented.- Eugene's ""conversion"" is the result of the imagination station.- The ending was a little tacky (I am not going to give it away.)Other than those points, however, this is a fun listening experience."
5,The best odyssey collection yet!,These tapes are full of reunions from MR Glossman to Richard maxwell to DR.Blagerd. it also includes Eugene becuming a christian. It's the best hands down
1,wish it were longer,I have amazing memories of exercizing in high school P.E.to this music. I have looked everywhere for it and am glad to have located it. I just wish that this CD had the whole version.
1,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed when I received this CD. It wasn't at all what I expected. I was looking for a fun CD that my daughter dances to in dance class and instead, I got a drill sergeant CD. :("
4,Not Quite The Same,"While this clearly is Robert Preston and parts of the Chicken Fat I grew up with, it is only a 4 minute version, not the 10 minute version used during PE classes when it was raining to too cold for outdoors classes.So you will get parts of what you remember, just not the entirety."
2,Chicken Fat CD,This was not the same as the original 45 record I have. I did not like this cd. I still use the record. This just sits in my cd holder. Do not recommend.
1,Chicken Fat,This is not the same recording that was popular in the 1960's and played in every gymnasium in the country. I was very disappointed that it was an abbreviated version of the exercise routine that I remember doing in grade school.
1,"Original version, Robert Preston--NOT","I ordered this because it came up in search as the Robert Preston version of ""Chicken Fat"". It is not. It is about 2-3 minutes of the introduction then it is a changed version without Robert Preston through the rest. Very disappointing to me and I wasted money on the CD."
3,"Go you chicken fat, go away...","This isn't the ""Chicken Fat"" you remeber from grade school--it is a shortened version, but it's fun all the same! The CD does have a longer version included that is instumental only, so if you can fill in your own aerobic exercises, it works great! I love the music. It reminds me of those days back in grade school when we would all line up across the room and work out to ""Go you chicken fat, go away--go you chicken fat, go!"""
5,Chicken Fat,This was a grade school favorite that I am going to pass on to my grandkids. I hope they find it as much fun as I did.Chicken Fat
4,Exquisite work and a wise selection of musicians,"Not that ""Four seasons of life"" is a bad album.But this is,by far,much better.This time,Mr Grapow made a serious effort to work as a real band,and man,it really sounds good.Vescera is a good singer,and I don't know if it's due to his presence that the album has a Malmsteen flavor all over it.But it's better that Grapow this time got himself a real singer,instead of taking himself the charge of vocals.Grapow,as a singer...is such a good guitarist.This is a heavy album,without grandiloquences or whatever kind of things like that.All the band sounds very tight,and Vescera sounds quite better than he did in his last work with Malmsteen.The jewel of the album?""Listen to the lyirics"",definitely,an instrumental called that with the peculiar sense of humor that seems to be Mr. Grapow's trademark.A must have for metal fans,but a must have too for guitar fans.This won't disappoint none of them."
5,I was referred by my golf buddy dan,I am another happy buyer of this product for over a year. Never had any problem.
5,great value,"I waited for about 8 months before giving this a review, as I really wanted to put it through its paces. It is a tremendous value and works very well. I had a minor communication problem over e-mail, but it was resolved, and when a part broke after 7 months it was promptly replaced. My course is in So. Calif. and is hilly, and the Explorer works like a champ on it. Many others who play my course have brands that cost twice as much and do not perform any better. I am very pleased with the cart and reccomend it without qualifocation."
5,This is a wonderful book,"F.B.Meyer is a wonderful Christian author, I love his books, I started reading them when I was sixteen years old, thanks to his devotional writings I grew up in grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. I advise all of my brothers and sisters in Christ to read and possess all of the books of this gifted writer who (being dead yet speaketh.)"
5,A blast from the past,"A really good read... I purchased the title, because I love classic science fiction, and I was not dissapointed. This is the kind of book, that would make a great movie... and I see Kurt Russell in the lead... I don't know why, just do.Pick it up and give it a spin, I think you'll have a fun read."
5,Awesome Read,"This is an excellent science-fiction book, written in the classic style. I should know that it's awesome... because I wrote it."
3,Very Verbose,"This book consists of 12 disjointed essays looking at basing American education on a more holistic ""kindergarten"" approach. While I thought the basic premise of the book was interesting, I didn't think the book did very much with the idea.After reading books like The Teaching Gap and Why Johnny Still Can't Read (I highly recommend both!), I found this book disappointing. The articles lacked real world examples and down to earth language. There was one noted exception: Essay 2 written by Susan Ohanian which was extremely well written and worth reading.I guess my biggest problem with this book was for the most part, I couldn't find ""This is the problem and it's causes and here are our suggestions."""

4,"Good for the ""whys""","This little book is very good is very good at explaining WHY we do what we do at the Mass. I bought it for my children and have found it to be a wonderful resource: we don't want them in church just following along in boredom with no understanding of Jesus' great sacrifice, made for His love of each one of us. This book is simple enough for a little one of five or six to understand and uses little poems (which adults find cheesy, but children generally seem to love) to describe the various events. This book is not a missal that gives, for instance, the actual words of the Penitential Rite or the Creed -- for that you would need an actual children's missal. In spite of that, I am glad we have this book to help us teach our children about the enormous significance of what happens at the Mass."
4,INSTRUMENTALLY YOURS,"Throughout Alan Parsons' musical journey, his albums contained imaginative instrumental breaks which thematically reinforced the vocal offerings. Arista decided to take ten of these instrumentals and THE INSTRUMENTAL WORKS is the result.As much as I like Parsons stellar albums, these tracks don't truly stand alone out of their original environment. Whle PIPELINE and I ROBOT are polished and melodic, MAMMAGAMMA, HAWKEYE and URBANIA seem repetitive and uninspired, although they are more effective in their original settings.Of course, Parsons fans will treasure this collection as a reminder of how inventive Parsons could be."
3,For Beginners only,"I was expecting a more advanced book based on it was written by ""Lou Krieger"" a well know Card player Magazine columnist. But this book was just written to capitalize on his name the growing popularity of online gambling. Only buy this book if you are new to both poker and online poker. There is a lot of fluff in this book and in the fast evolving arena on online poker most advice will be outdated in 6 months."
2,Not much here...,"Signing up and playing for free at any online site will teach you 90% of what's in this book. I've played a little over two weeks online, and found nothing in this book that wasn't already obvious. The practice hands are a useful idea, but while I waited for this book to arrive, I've played hundreds and hundreds of hands and started reading books on poker.I skimmed and understood everything in this book except the practice hands in a couple hours. It contains nothing that you would ever refer to once you know how to play.If you want to learn poker and play online, buy a book about POKER, not online play. You can figure out the online play without much time or effort."
2,Save your money,"I've purchased 5 poker books in the past few months and this is by far the poorest. It's Texas Holdem section doesnt go beyond pre-flop play - literally! No advice on what to do after flop, on turn, at river. It comes with a free CD which, from what I gathered, promotes an online poker site. My guess is that they are marketing the site. No real content in book.(...)"
2,"Great for Beginners, but thats all","I was slightly disappointed with this book. I have been playing online for a month or so and have learned 96% of the information in this book myself. If you are a new poker fan (a la Travel Channel Wednesday nights) looking to play online, then this is a good read. If you are familiar with the internet and have a basic understanding of poker this book will not help you much. I would suggest taking the money and just playing some games online."
1,What is this game called poker?,"I was greatly disappointed by this book, although I'm not an experienced player myself. If you've never played poker, and aren't quite sure what the internet is, this book might be a suitable start. However, for most people reading it is just a waste of time. The author spends as much time at telling you what's best of a flush and a straight, as what hands you should play; the lack of important information is the most striking feature of the book."
1,disappointment,"I read this book after playing online poker for 2 weeks, and was disappointed. The best way to learn is get on and play with money you don't mind losing. This book would be for somebody that is uncomfortable doing even that. And if you're uncomfortable testing the waters with a small amount of real money, maybe you shouldn't be playing poker. Bottom line is you can learn more in an evening of real online action than you can from this book. A footnote, the index is completely off, if you're looking for specific data, it sends you to the wrong pages. Weird. Read some of the classics by Sklansky instead."
2,Reconsider...,"....will the reading of this book improve your game, personally as a semi Professional player that has participated in the WSOP, I would urge all new players to start off just playing for play money. To improve your tournament play you should play freerolls. If you find yourself, hitting a place, then it is time to play for real money online, not before."
3,"Too Much Beat, Not Enough Melody","Had This one on my wish list, based on the reviews here. My wife just got it for me, for my birthday. Now I'm wishing she had picked another one. I was expecting to hear more Indian music, but what this has is mostly techno & tabla beats, with sparse melodies and harmonies. It really doesn't give me the kind of exotic flavour I am looking for. Also, all the beats on here are up-tempo, and there is very little dynamic in the music. All this adds up to listenable music that gets boring fairly quickly. There may be one or two standout tracks on here, but nothing you can really hang your heart on."
3,interesting,"this album is a sort of strange blend of indian and electronica. Its a good intro to the new loungy sound if you're coming out of petshopboys and 808state. the sound they come out with is approaching the talvin singh-y sound but with synth and drums that'll make you new order fans start tapping your fingers. i'm not sure how to slot it, its not lounge, and its not electronica. its interesting to listen to, but for some really good loungy/downtempo stuff head over to nitin sawhney or thievery corporation."
5,Never liked techno:,"I have never bought a techno music album. I always thought that techno music was souless. But One and One is One is techno music with soul. I loved its combination of synthesized sounds with that of the human voice and the organic sounds of flute, sitar and other traditional eastern instruments. This fusion of the technological and the traditional, the synthetic and the organic, make this album interesting and exciting to listen to. And man, can you dance to it! I highly recommend it."
4,Cool Asian Dance Vibes,"One or two of the tracks on this album lose their way a bit but songs like ""Fingers"" and ""Asian Vibes"" more than make up for it. I love the breakbeats and the uplifting female vocals and the eastern style samples. A record that really grows on you and one of the more accessible albums to come from the UK asian dance scene."
5,One of my favorite versions,"Hyman is a wonderful illustrator and her version of Sleeping Beauty is beautiful. It is one of the best versions since Edmund Dulac's classic illustrations. In fact, I don't have many favorite versions that have been published in the last fifty years. This is the version of Sleeping Beauty that I prefer to keep on my shelf for reading to children. The characters appear real and magical all at once. Hyman is a Caldecott award winning illustrator. This book is another example of why she is so honored."
3,gestures book,"The service of the vendor was great, but the book left a little to be desired -- not what I thought it would be."
4,"Useful, interesting and funny","This is a nice book. If you are going to travel abroad or you meet foreign people, you would like to know what these people understand from your body language. Of course, the book also gives you good material for chatting with friends from anywhere (including your own coutry).Don't expect the book to tell you what a gesture means in every part of the world or to show you every gesture used in some part of the world. The book of course doesn't do such a hard task, though it tries: it explains you the gestures that are generalized (or most common) in a country. However, be always aware that there are exceptions and gestures you should know and are not included in the book.Below are some questions you'll answer reading the book. In some cases the book gives you also the explanation about the gesture (what it comes from).Where should you avoid the ""OK sign""?Where should a man enter before a woman?Why Latin people get closer to you when talking?How should you bow in Japan?"
3,Not sure if I like this,"From the title it sounds good, but it seems like he spends more time explaining the problem than actually telling you what to watch out for."
3,Become a soldier drug dealer!,"Yeah, okay, way too much ""how to become a drug user"" for my taste. I was bored to tears for half this book, and the ending... eh. I got it free, and glad I did, as I would never had purchased it myself otherwise. Well, glad I did in the fact that I read it. But the story itself, while well written, was simply not my cup of tea. At a time when I have relatives serving overseas in a war, the corrupt dealings in this novel left a bad taste in my mouth."
2,No Catch-22!,"At least it didn't resonate with me, except when I was offended, which was often: at each of the many occurrences of racial pejoratives.The novel is written in the second person, and it suffers therefrom. When it says ""You . . . [think or do something grossly out of character for the reader] it creates (in this reader, at least) a distracting cognitive dissonance.The blurb on the front cover calls the book ""blindingly funny,"" a great overstatement. There are a few laughs, perhaps the choicest of which is 'you' leaving a Coney Island trout under the top sergeant's pillow (clearly an unwise thing, which I would never have done)All in all, a great disappointment.watziznaym@gmail.com"
2,Funny but wildly out of touch with reality,"Others have reviewed the comedic style of the author and compared it to Catch-22, et alia. That's fine: It's an okay style, sometimes amusing, sometimes distracting.But the book couldn't decide what it wanted to be. O'Connor seems to have waffled on whether he was writing a realistic book about the military's dark underbelly, or writing a Douglas Adams-esque preposterous farce. Ultimately, it's a book written set in amongst the military by someone with zero apparent military experience, who skimped on research.Still, even if those who know the military will be distracted by the implausibility of important plot elements...if you ACCEPT the fantasy in the same way that one might accept the premise of a swords-and-sorcery novel, THEN it becomes a funny read. It's all a matter of suspension of disbelief."
2,A Disappointment,"To be honest, this wasn't a book I would have read on my own, but, as O'Connor was a guest to a college fiction class, I read Buffalo Soldiers regardless.The book was meant for the male half of our species, to be sure, as there is absolutely no endearing value whatsoever to a female like myself. Being that it is written in the second person, an unusual choice but an effective one, it puts the reader into the life of the lead character, Ray Elwood, immediately. Unfortunately, I was very uncomfortable in that role, to say the least. I was not alone in that, either, as many of my fellow students also reported that they did not enjoy the book, and would never have read it except for the grade.Does it evoke emotion? Definitely. Even though I came to hate Elwood, that very feeling convinced me that this was a gifted writer. I do hope that O'Connor continues in what appears to be his chosen field. But would I recommend this book to others? Not a chance."
4,"Odd, but fun to read. Great storyline","Ok, this was a VERY strange way to write a book, but I'd felt like I was there!Read in a day...so I may have skipped over some parts that needed to be read slower (I can read 75-150 pages an hour). Was tough getting adjusted to [""bla bla bla"" you said]. Compares itself to ""Catch-22"", but why go up against the best? Come on now."
4,"An interesting story, non-fiction in some aspects","When I picked up this book I had a good idea what I was getting, and for the most part I was right. Its fiction, but revolves around the concept of armies and how they aren't all glamorous. While I didn't expect facts and dates being that the book is fiction I felt the story did try to make it seem like this could be real.. and I wasn't really a fan of that.The story itself is a solid writing and if fictional war concepts are your thing, this book is for you. I did notice a couple other reviewers saying the content was inaccurate, and not a good read for a solider, but being that its fiction i'm not 100% sure how that is even relevant. In this case I say read the synopsis, other reviews here on Amazon and decide if its the book for you."
2,Redeeming?,"From the title Buffalo Soldiers, I thought there would be some brave individuals, independent perhaps for the army but none the less brave. Instead, I found no characters with integrity, a sense of responsibility or even a smidgen of patriotism. I slogged on, expecting change but it never came with the book ending, the print anyway with no real resolution. The writing , descriptions and action was fine but without characters or a plot, this was very forgettable."
2,"The ""You are there"" narrative approach doesn't work for me.","I was totally put off by the narrative conceit of this novel - the author writing about ""you""(as in: You are reading a book, you are walking down the street, you are selling drugs inGermany, you are an idiot!) There were some interesting story elements, but the style effectivelydisconnected me from it.I wouldn't recommend this until a really good editor has had at it."
3,Uneven.,"Parts of this novel were captivating and parts of it were very funny. Other chapters (where the main character was hanging out with his ""friends"") were dull. It doesn't help that almost all of the characters in this novel are idiots. I actually liked the book better after I had finished it. The finale is surprising and defies formula."
4,Roman Historical Novel,This is one of the best continuing series for Historical novels. I have read both of the gladiator books and look forward to the next one.... Duffy has created a true hero and basically sticks to the facts. Great book
2,Port Authority- Denim and Twill Letterman jacket J761 - X Large,"iF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICE, I'll KEEP QUIET WON'T SAY ANYTHING, I WOIULD NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM PORT AUTHORITY AGAIN."
2,it's really not that bad.........,"The Big Noise isn't the worst L&H film, far from it. Though it certainly isn't anywhere near their best. It is a fun little film with several good gags and a pleasant tone. Fans of the Boys will be pleasantly surprised, and youngsters just getting to know the joys of L&H will love it."
5,The funniest of their later 1940s films!,"In his video guide,Leonard Maltin described The Big Noise as Laurel & Hardy's worst film.If you ask me,he's exaggerating.In fact,I find this to be one of their best and funniest movies.There is a lot of laughs in this film."
3,an explosive invention?,"In 1944 before the atomic bomb became public knowledgeit was humor for an inventor to come up with avery powerful explosive.The comedy here is classic L&H; with both a little on the plump side.A pretty blond and a black widow round out the cast besides the little Indian who makes some trouble for his father the inventor.I liked it, but it was a little slow even with the apartment of the future and the new explosive."
2,"If you love Laurel & Hardy, please skip this comedy bomb","""The Big Noise"" deserves its reputation as the worst of the Laurel & Hardy feature films. In this 1944 films for 20th-Century Fox, the boys are janitors for a private detective agency who, of course, pass themselves off as real sleuths. Hired to protect the inventor of a new ""Super Bomb."" This film might have the minor distinction of being the first comedy about the atomic bomb. The boys managed to outwit the enemy agents and end up using the bomb to sink a Japanese submarine. Strictly for children, if you are true fans of Laurel & Hardy you will want to skip this one. It will only make you sad."
2,Worth a look:a textbook of familiar Laurel & Hardy routines.,"Critics have slammed this picture more than any other Laurel & Hardy comedy because it's loaded with tried-and-true material. But that's part of the fun with L & H, and the film isn't as bad as they say. If you like Stan and Ollie you'll certainly enjoy (and recognize) the jokes. The video transfer is excellent, with crisp, clear picture and sound."
1,Stupidity,"""Faces of Death"" for rightwing paranoid Chickenhawks who need justification for sitting on their couches rooting at the war like it was a football game while their countrymen die for Bush's lies"
1,American Brainwashing,"Are the terrorists sick individuals? Certainly!Did the US have moral obligation to invade Iraq and execute countless innocents? Certainly NOT!More cheap propaganda to brainwash the American public.Never forget the REAL reason we invaded Iraq...WMDs!Bush LIED and we are paying the price (along with London, Spain, etc.). Don't believe the hype."
1,Wast of money and time,"A waste of money and time. This is a one sided Docufactory to boost the moral of the politicians and to get more votes. Sorry to have to subject my self to a half truths. I do not condone what Saddam did but having another Saddam in deferent clothing's is not what the Iraqi people want or a puppet government whether in Iraq or Afghanistan. The blunt attach on Islam will not get us any where it will drive us farther so nothing is solved. I had hoped that some one will have the guts and get us a Documentary, not to pass his or his pay masters opinions of view to us the viewers but to really tell us the truth ""truth"" if there is any.If there were a minus I would have rated it with a -***"
2,"""Faces of Death"" meets ""Hearts and Minds""","I'm torn over this little documentary... on one hand, I think people need to see the full extent of the savagery of Islamic terrorists and middle eastern tyrannies. I'll never forget seeing the documentary ""Night and Fog"" in college in 1983. This was before home video. Few of us had ever seen graphic images from the Holocaust. A few people had to get up and leave the classroom... I stayed, and my perspective was changed forever. Images truly are stronger than words.But good grief, did they have to get so political? The dialogue comes off as cheap propaganda. It almost has an infomercial feel to it. And why is the host in a dog kennel?"
1,How excuses can turn Lies into Truth,"This can only work on it's pornographic depiction of violence and also as a first-rate propaganda material that exploits it's shocking quality to both convince the narrow-minded people, by presenting them with the excuse they need to justify their beliefs, and the naive people, by presenting them with images of the 'so-called truth' creating in people's minds that have a 'black & white' worldview the impression that the only 'logical' reaction they are experiencing while watching this material (revolt) is also the reaction their country ought to take... Garbage for those that can't (or won't) put two and two together while all the time thinking themselves perfectly able to put one and one together..."
1,Only for sick sick people,"Nothing to be proud of. A collection of garbage, for collectors of garbage.It makes me ill, and so does the marketing of it.I wonder if they ever collected footage from Rykers Island or some of the other high security prisons around?Nothing to be proud of here."
1,Hypocritical,"Taylor accosts the left for siding with the Muslims (a hoot in itself) while at the same time showing Kerry, Clinton and other liberals singing the right's tune. This is pure hypocrisy in its purest most unadulterated and visible form. These movie makers should have more had brains than this - but it simply highlights the two-tongued,twisted logic of the right and its propagandists."
2,What a let-down!,"This book was a disappointment! The patterns for mittens, socks, and scarves are nothing special and can be found anywhere. The pattern for the felted cat/dog blanket calls for 4-8 skeins of Brown Sheep Lamb's Pride wool for each (at a cost of approx $7/skein) I think my local animal shelter would be much happier if I donated an old blanket and $56 worth of pet food instead of one felted blanket. The kid's hat with flaps looked a bit ""off"" with the flaps small and oddly placed. And the booties don't stay on."
4,Very cute patterns!,"I just got this book and have enjoyed looking through at the pictures. Since I am trying to finish a project for a baby right now, I haven't had a chance to start any of these new patterns, but I can't wait to get started on one. The only problem that I have is the use of double pointed needles. I have not tried that yet, so it scares me a little. Also, some of the yarns that she uses have been discontinued since the book is a few years old. For instance, Berrocco Pronto is mentioned a couple times and they don't make it anymore. Muench/GGH Goa is a good alternative."
3,Not for Beginners,"I haven't knitted since I was a child in the 1960s. With the arrival of my first grandchild, Iwanted to try my hand again. While the projects in this book are attractive, I take issue with some of the instructions. For example, making some of the hats requires use of double pointed needles and circular needles. Since I had not made any projects requiring these needles, it would ahve been useful to have illustrations and instructions on the use of these tools. I had to go to the internet to get this. I think that the author either took too much for granted or the book is targeted to a more advanced knitter."
4,the jedi training book,This book was not to bad. It's not the best book because there were very hard questions.But you do learn a lot.
2,Don't expect your mouth to look like Angelina's!,"While Sovage works well to soothe chapped lips, I got absolutely no benefit in the plumping department that this product boasts of. I cannot recommend this product in the least on the basis of its plumping capabilities. It does provide a nice gloss; however, I can think of a lot of good lip glosses that don't cost the same as a tank of gas."
3,Okay condition,My cookbook came on time. It was in okay condition for the price I paid. I would consider doing business with this seller again.
5,"Fun, Spunk, Meaningful Lyrics, and Originality!","One Eighty (Or Flight 180 as it should be called now) has everything one should look for in a Christian album. A good sound, good singers, and the lyrics actually mean something. I'd also like to show the ""One Eighty"" from Tulsa their great shame for following the world by suing their Christian brothers and sisters in Flight 180. Very immature, and unchristian, and just UN-BIBLICAL! Happy Peace folks!"
5,5 stars - Still not enough!,"Holy Cow! I LOVE these guys. Their album Crackerjack hasn't left my cd player for weeks! I love Assiduous Blues, Tick Tock, whatever you want to call it. I'm 16 and I go swing dancing every friday night and I can't wait until ""Caitlan's song"", as my friends call it, is played. I Love This Cd. I can listen to it constantly, which i pretty much do, and not get sick of it. I would totally recommend this Cd to just about everyone."
5,Awesome-Original Ska/Punk/Swing/Pop!!!,"One-Eighty are just an awesome band... I bought this CD, thinking ""ahh, they'll be something like the Dance Hall Crashers (who are excellent in their own degree)"", but 180 has their own style and are a unique and talented band. Although I don't like too many ska bands with female vocals, Madelyn & Kim harmonize together so perfectly that you can't help but sing along. ""405"", ""Sally"" & ""Just Like You"" are some of my favorites, but every track on ""Crackerjack"" are spunky and worth the low price amazon.com offers. If you like upbeat and catchy tunes with a twist of awesome lyrics and original vocalists - get this CD!"
5,the most awsome christan group ever by brian buster,the most amazing group to ever hit the ska-swing scean poped up a few years ago there name one eighty. this cd in piticular cracker jack is awsome because of the combination of the styles in the music they play but my favorite is the female volcales of kim teenenburg and madelyn mendoza. they sing beutifly they also have alot of fast songs for those who like to skank. there new cd lineup comes out sept 14
1,"Not robust, broke during first installation","Cannot recommend this product. Blasted thing's plastic clip (one of two) broke when putting it on the basket hoop. Only thing I can think that might have contributed to this was that it was stored in the garage before putting it on (temperature probably 45 degrees) and I guess that contributed to it ""snapping"" when I put it on. Hard to believe. Maybe they should tell you to only install this product during the summertime? Tried to follow up with Mfg but no response so $30 dollars later I am stuck with a broken product."
1,Not worthy,Bought this for my sons. Sounded like a good idea. My husband installed it and it broke the second time the ball hit it. We literally had it one for ten minutes. Not worth the time it took to order it.
1,Product broke within 10 minutes of installation,My 11 year old shot no more than 10 baskets for each side started cracking then popped off. This is junk.
3,ok,"Flimsy,but works.Thought it would be tougher for the money.My son likes it because it works,but as a consumer there are better ones out there."
2,plastic,"whole thing is plastic with hooks that clip on the rim. the clips wont stay on and it is very flimsy,Not worth more than ten bucks..."
4,Basketball return,I really like this product works really well I will say that I agree with another person's review about how after my shots the Hooks will come off the rim and it's a pain in the butt to have to put it back on the rim so i just taped it to the rim and it works perfect.
4,We like this item,"We have had several basketball returns. This one is the best so far. Main reason for this is the ball comes out the basket and back to you more smoothly. It looks and seems bulky at first but does the job it is supposed to do. The ""yellow"" springy one we had (two different times because the first one broke) sent the ball in different directions depending on how the basket was made. This return is more consistent. We did have to modify how it was mounted on the rim because the net would get caught between the ball and the return after a basket was made and ""keep"" or ""hold"" the ball up in the goal. One could also remove the net. Our fix was to mount the arms a little differently on the rim so the return had a different angle. My teen sons and I play a lot of driveway ball and therefore need the ball to ""stay"" on the drive. We would make this purchase again!"
1,broke first hour!,Clips to the back of the rim both broke within the first hour and during normal shooting - no horse-play was involved!
1,Terrible - don't waste your money,This is terrible. Broken first time my son used it. It is made of cheap plastic. Don't waste your money
1,Breaks pretty easily,"It actually broke during the installation. I used some wire to secure it.I don't think it is going to last very long.When it ships, it comes in a flat package."
3,Graham can do better!,I expected more from this effort! Will see you at the Park West in Chicago in December. looking forward to your reunion tour/1
4,great stuff!,The bonus tracks were a bit repetitive but a very nice addition to an already exceptional album. A fantastic collecton of music from a innovative artist. Highly recommended.
3,Three excellent songs and some that are alright,"Graham Parker is indeed an interesting artist, refusing to be labelled. His mix of different musical styles like rock, soul, pop, punk is usually very attractive and it's a shame that Parker is so unknown or unappreciated. But ""Squeezing out sparks"" is far from his best work even `tho it includes three of his finest songs ever: ""You can't be too strong"", ""Saturday nite is dead"", and ""Protection"". These tracks make it worth to buy the album but I think you better get ""Howling wind"" and ""Deepcut to nowhere"" first, since they are both excellent and superior to this one."
5,"yes, a classic, but...","this does indeed rate five stars, but then ""howlin' wind"" and ""heat treatment,"" by the same standard, rate six. i could listen to nothing but those three works by this then-angry brit (mellowed a lot since his marriage and parenthood) for the rest of my life and be satisfied. gp knows how to write rock 'n' roll, and at this point in his life, he had the gut for it. the rumour was also one of the finest backing units in rock history. for the record, and since there is some confusion in these reviews on the subject, ""you can't be too strong"" is not pro-choice. it's not pro-life in the sense of being strident and preachy, but it sure as hell ain't pro-choice. it's scary and real. and it's pure rock genius, which is perhaps no more than lots of talent, but when listening to the likes of this, i don't care."
5,Great work! (& a correction),"A landmark recording that helped tp sculpture where rock music should head. Just a note to let Geoffry Himes, your staff reviewer, know that ""You can't be too strong"" is in fact an ANTI-abortion song----not a pro-choice. Parker was quite the conservative punk. Regardless, this is indeed a fine effort!"
1,it doesn't work,"I bought two and both worked bad.one the battery did not work, and another one the memory..."
1,1 star is as low as it goes.,"This mp3 player, bought for Christmas, has stopped working already. First the names of the songs got all wonky, saying one thing while playing another. Now the battery will not hold a charge at all. Spend your money on something better!"
3,if it dont work then send it back to amazon,"i got my first one of these a few weeks ago. everything was fine, but the usb cord sent with it dont work so i am using a digital camera one. but before you start addin things to it you must first format it. the manual wont say it but the nextar site says to. i requested a return from amazon and got the new one sent to me in like 3 days. and all i have to do is send back the bad one at a nominal cost to myself. no 25 bucks like the nextar company wants. but as for now the new one is working fine. just remember to format it when u get it and always use the remove hardware safely feature on your computer."
1,totally disappointed,"received the mp3 player very fast, looked good, but unfortunatly wasn't working. returned it to the shipper,at my cost, for a replacement, that one came after 3 weeks, but wasn't working either. now i am told i have to pay $25.00 for them to shipp another replacement. contacted amazon, amazon said i can return the item, at their cost, and they will refund the money including the shipping costs."
1,It doesn't work,"I bought one of these for my 15 yr. old. It came in the mail fairly quickly, but upon plugging in, all it will do is say low battery. The unit will not take a charge. I contacted the seller, and they refunded the before ship price. All in all, I would have to say this thing is junk, buyer beware."
1,Junk,"I don't remember all the things wrong with this. Mostly, it was very poor quality. I'm pretty sure the one I received didn't work and that's why it got sent back."
1,NOT WORKING AT ALL,"I bought 03 of this players, the first one i tried to format as the web page recommends; it couldn`t be formatted. the second one doesn`t turns on and the third one got the format, turns on and off normally but the battery never gets charged!!!!! that`s a very bad product, i might give a D- qualifying"
2,An 11-year-old legal book can not be relied on.,"The book was outstanding when published. Unfortunately, that was in 2000. While some of the material in this book is still reliable, one should not rely on a law book that is a decade old. That is dangerous. When the next revision comes out, I will be the first to buy it."
5,Great Resource!,"Our local writers'critique group is often stumped by copyright laws. This guide is written in plain, understandable language. It covers questions I didn't know needed to be asked. The DVD is most helpful. The online web site will insure the information stays current. While interesting information, it's more of a resource than everyday reading. Nice to have on my bookshelf."
4,A Myriad of Information at Hand,I find myself referring to this book constantly. Has been a useful tool for me. I purchased this book from Amazon and am very pleased.
3,It is what it is,It's big and it's thin. We applied it to the wall of the entrance of our party. It's a plastic table cover type material and should be bought at a dollar store so don't spend more then $10 on it!
3,I don't consider this item a toy. As a decoration it was excellent.,I used this item as a decoration. It was very colorful & great. I would recommend it for any luau!
2,noisey and underwhleming,"norma jean seem to live souly on break neck, off key rythyms. they also have a knack for show casing choppy time changes and blasting out tuneless riffage and meadnering screams. They aim for the uncomprismising but they somehow,despite how loud and noisey they are,they just sound underwhelming. while the sole track on their previous release ""memphis will be lade to waste"" (and maybe ""face:face"") actually conjured up a dizzying array of breakdowns and cahotic confusion, here they offer just conufsion. theres not much shape to the tunes and they seem to end and begin without much of either, and their tuneless riffs get irritating fast. if theres any listenably in all this is the odd rythym changes within each song. But i guess alot of the hardcore nowadays lives off that aspect alone. noisey and underhwelming"
4,Good Album Marred By Bad Production,"I know this album was made to parallel the sound of We Are Romans by Botch, and the parallels are obvious, but there is no reason the production should suffer. OGTA could have easily been a 5-star album if it wasn't so overly saturated and crushed in the mix. The music is solid, albeit a bit repetitive, but that's really their shtick after all. More importantly, it's as aggressive as rabid dog leaping for your throat. Unfortunately, said dog is chained by the aforementioned problems. Shorten it up by a song or two, touch up the sound quality, and you have yourself a near perfect album."
4,People are Crazy,"One thing that I do not get is how many people ther are that hate this cd. They are all of a sudden saying that Norma Jean is bad compared to the first cd. I remember when Josh was first leaving the band and they had gotten Cory there new vocalist. Everyone was so glad because ""Josh Sucks."" I heard this several times. Now when they come out with this cd and it isn't good and has deep meaning, now everyone hates the new NJ. We'll all you people need to make up your minds. Of course you cannot measure up to the first cd, and yes this cd is full of meaningless riffs and chords. But this cd isn't bad, it is just not as good. Everyone needs to just take a chill pill and relax. It is only music. It should be 3.5 Stars."
3,Listen once a twice a month or so,"A decent album following up a hard to beat ""Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child"". O God the Aftermath is a album that should be listned to once or twice every few months. By doing this, it retains the music so it's not to annoying. Certaintly not a c.d. that should stay in a c.d. player for months on end."
3,GOOD ALBUM NOT GREAT,"Norma Jean the christian noise-core band from Atlanta is back with a new singer. I like the old one better, the original singer had a sic scream. But still this cd is better than most of the new releases this year. Tracks 1-4 are awesome but beyond that is nothing that has spoken to me. I just can't get into it. But maybe if I listen to it alot it'll grow on me. If you've never heard of Norma Jean I recomend The 1st album ""Bless The Martar Kiss The Child"" if you like it give this one a chance stand out tracks on this one as I said before are 1-4. Check out 1-2-3-4-9 on Bless the Maytar...Also the old singer is now in The Chariot. Looking very forward to hear where this band goes. Also enjoy the christian aspect."
3,the old norma jean is officially no more.,"i remember the first time i heard ""bless the martyr"" about 2 years ago, i was blown away at how different norma jean sounded compared to the other hardcore bands like avenged sevenfold and atreyu, they had something that made them different, a special uniqueness that made me want to hear more and more of them. i can say without any reservations that the uniqueness in them is gone. their new album isnt bad, it just isnt norma jean. to call this album horrible would be unfair, becuase its not a bad CD, it just isnt what i expected to hear from norma jean, so i reccomend this CD, but only with the warning that if youre expecting to hear the good ol' norma jean that its not going to live up to those expectations. i think that it would have been a better move for them to change their name, then it would feel more right than it does right now."
3,-----------,"After listening to this new album, I must say that there are a couple standout tracks. ""Bayonetwork"" being one of these. The rest of the tracks sound all very similar. the new singer sounds like a copycat of Botch's vocalist, Dave Verellen (Botch is a great band, by the way). I'd rather listen to Norma Jean's preceding album, ""Bless the Martyr, Kiss the Child"".. or Botch's ""Anthology of Dead Ends"" or ""We Are the Romans"". Its okay, but definitely not what it was hyped up to be. Definitely a letdown for me."
1,where's the rhythm?,"This cd should come with a warning label saying ""not for fans of previous norma jean album"". I miss the old norma jean"
3,Can You Say... Norma BOTCH?,"This just isn't Norma Jean if you ask me. The songs are pretty bland and the new singer doesn't hold a candle to Josh. He has no range or emotion. I feel that the band may know this and thats why they sound more like a watered down Botch on this album then anything. But Botch would have done a better job.Don't get me wrong. This isn't bad, its just a step in the wrong direction compared to Bless The Maryter, Kiss The Child."
2,This sounds like...,"well Botch. Of course Botch pioneered that kind of sound and these guys just listened to it as we all did back in the good ole hardcore days when it was worth something and I am not saying they riped them off but were at least ""heavily influenced""."
4,Lest you forgot what Botch sounded like...,"When I first spun this CD in my car stereo the thing that immediately jumped into my mind is that this CD sounded more like Botch than anything I'd ever heard besides Botch. This isnt necessarily a bad thing though, I liked Botch a lot and this is a great CD nonetheless. O' God the Aftermath isnt as noisy as Norma Jean's past CD's and certainly nowhere near as noisy as Josh Scogins new band the Chariot, but still contains enough mathy riffs to satisfy any fan of your standard mathcore bands (Dillinger, Coalesce, Botch, ETID, etc) Overall definitely worth a listen."
5,Different but Amazing,"The first time I listened to this album I almost threw it out because it was so DIFFERENT from Kiss the Martyr. I didnt listen to it for awhile, but eventually I started to listen to it and I noticed how good it really it really was. I think people who buy it should listen to it fully through the first time. Every song is amazing on this cd its just different. The guitar riffs are still amazing just in a different way than Kiss the Martyr...Whoever said this album is garbage should take a close listen. Yes the new singer is nowhere as good as Josh was, he really doesnt have any range but he is still good without it. The music matters more to me than the singer tho and the music is amazing but it differs from Bless the Martyr because it is much more repetitive, but Ive learned to like repetitive music much like A Life Once Lost. All in All an amazing album you just gotta break it in."
3,For those who like their hardcore hard boiled,"Straight to the heart hardcore metal. Fast, crude and in your face. Norma Jean definitely do not pull their punches. Their riffs are tight and hit all the right spots. But i don't know, an album like this make me start to feel like I'm getting old. The pace and the buckets of adrenalin involved in an album like just isn't enough to hold my interest any more.When i heard Vision of Disorder for the first time I stood up and listened. But now 8 years on and i hear a band like norma jean i just want to go to sleep. Anyway the kids will love it and i am sure that they would put on an awesome live show. For us heavy music fans that have been around the block a couple of times, well, move along, move along there is nothing here to see, folks."
3,...,"First off, go down and read Daniel McGuffey's review. I agree with him in just about everything. However, he says that the new vocalist is not any good, which i disagree with. The new vocalist is good but has a different sound than Josh. One of the things i miss the most with the vocals is the range. Anyways, on to the rest. I know that they have matured and all, but sometimes, the complex riffs and and time signatures just sound empty and muddled. I know breakdowns are easier to play, but on Bless the Martyr..., they were BEAUTIFUL. That being said, i dont want a carbon copy of that album, but i sure do miss the old Norma Jean."
2,Why did they settle with this singer?,"Norma Jeans first album Bless the Martyr and Kiss the Child was one of the most amazing cd's that i have ever heard.I knew after the old singer josh left that their was no way that o god the after math would even come close to the first cd.This cd tends to have a diffrent feel to it.It doesnt seem as ear catching as the first one.I Found that it seems like they went for more mathcore with odd time and trying to make the songs as weird and crazy as they could.Very big dissapointment from Norma Jean.The Cd should be more titled, O God let me get a refund for this cd."
1,Terrible,This band is a terrible rip off of Botch. I don't know why people like this. I would be pissed at this band if I was a member of Botch.
1,What happened?,"I loved BTM,KTC. LOVED!! But this album sucks. There is no smoothness in it what so ever. I know it is metal but it just sounds like you gave a some monkeys some guitars and a drum kit. This new singer is terrible. They even sing in a couple of tracks! SING!! What has the world come to................"
1,they should be ashamed to call themselves Norma Jean...,"this is not the same norma jean,..... bless the martyr was absolutly amazing, this album is just terrible. typical hardcore garbage, terrible repetitive breakdowns is what you will find in o god the aftermath. bless the martyr had something about it, it was beauifuly chaotic. the incredible breakdowns made norma jeans noise. now with the release of o god... they do not deserved to take the title of norma jean. this album blows."
1,sucks ass,"This new album is nothing but bs to make a few bucks. Almost everysong sounds similar with monotone screams and high pitch harmonics on the guitar. I'm writing this reveiw out of my experience with listing and writing my own ""hardcore"" and more ""metal"" types of music and im not saying that screaming is bad, im saying that the singers is. More time should have been used to make this album with alot more thought and category with in the songs. In other words....I think norma jeans new album sucks."
1,I can't listing to this sh*t...,"Honestly all this screaming over and over is horrible and if they atleast played their music decent? Maiby it woulnd sound so bad but sadly Norma jean is one of the most unoriginals and pathetic excuse for a band. If you want good mathcore or screamo doe? Go with these bands... the end , dep , luddite clone but and just look past Norma jean's ""o god, the aftermath"" its a utterly piece of trash."
5,Five stars for the Norma Jean,"Anyone that does not like this cd comes exactly from the point that is left of the the dogs sunny point. It took me a minute to go from ""Bless the Martyr, Kiss the Children"" into this. But, once that happens, I want to tell my grandchildren about this cd. The Norma Jean keep changing on every album that they have put out. To go from the goodness that is ""The whole world is counting on me....."" into songs on this cd like ""Liarsenic"" is unfathomable. Hells yeah. If you are reading this and are even questioning about buying this cd, you had better take a hard left, walk out the door and go straight to the nearest ""whoever"" has this cd for sale!!!"
2,Just not the same,I like most of the hardcore community like/love norma jean but with the loss of the original singer i think they have lost the edge that made them so great. Dont get me wrong they have great potential with the new guy but its just lost on me. Not to be too harsh but this album sounds like a really hard version of likin park which to most would be a huge let down. Overall the production of this album is great and i can see where they were going with it but it just doesnt sound like norma jean without the original .........
4,Hard to put down,"The third of the trilogy, Chad Daybell ends his series on a high note. This was the most captivating of the three books with many unexpected twists and turns. The fictional account weaves LDS theology with interesting (and sometimes harrowing) depictions of future events. It will leave you wanting to know more about the future as seen by latter-day prophets. A great read for adolescents or for someone who wants to understand the LDS perspective on the Rapture."
4,great light weight jacket,I purchased this in white for the spring and fall - and it is a GREAT light weight jacket!
2,"Just the Facts, Ma'am","This book lists some interesting bits of information, but MANY of the items listed are not inventions at all: They are discoveries. (For example, the discovery that quinine could be used to cure malaria; The story of how our national anthem came about, etc.) The book jacket gushes about the ""wonderful assortment of quirky, colorful cartoons..."" There are a number of quirky cartoons, but they are ALL black & white drawings. Overall, it's an interesting book, but a book of interesting facts should try to keep its facts straight."
1,A good book but a despicable author,"I read this book some time ago and I did enjoy it, but upon learning now that Richard Took used his time in Russia while researching this book to abuse young children, including extremely young children/toddlers, I don't feel we should promote or buy a book that lines his pockets. Amazon should ashamed that they are still selling this book.He has been jailed in the UK (search on the Roger Took article in The Spectator newspaper), and as the crimes were so severe he may never get parole, but reading the passages in the book where he lived amongst the people to get his story while abusing their children, sickens me.Roger Took's abuse went much wider than just these Russian children, and involved serious abuse of children worldwide including his grandchildren, step grandchildren and a disabled child.Before you purchase this book, I strongly recommend you google him for the Spectator and BBC articles, and then decide if you really want to buy it."
5,mauraders are pwnage,joined the AF back in '97 and one of the first things i did once i got out of basic was buy a pair of these suckers b/c the boots they issued me were garbage. my job did not require steel toes. polishing these boots is a breeze. i wore them so much the tread was totally gone and the sole was flat. recently had them resoled and i'm still using them now. the other reviewer couldn't have said it any better- they feel more like sneakers than boots. i'm civilian now and i deliver pizza on the side and i'll wear them for that; they don't weigh much more than my sneakers and i don't feel anymore tired after running around in them all night than i would otherwise.
5,Easily one of the best soul albums ever made,"This is the best soul album to come out of Philadelphia, bar none. That's really all you need to know. If you like soul you'll adore Howard Tate's first album."
2,Cheap hide and fastening screws,"I'm a newbie and I bought it to learn, but I could immediately tell that the rough finish and soft spots on the heads was not good. Well the hide pop a hole two moths later (on that soft spot).The tuning screws did not seem to match the nuts shipped and to make it worse, the metal used is quite soft. Bottom line, if you plan to tune them you would easily damage the screws and nuts.I tried buying the new parts to get them to a good condition, but it was more expensive than buying a new set of decent bongo.Disappointing!"
2,"Great album, mp3 files are poor","This review pertains only to the Hallmark mp3 files. First off, they are in mono where the original album was in glorious stereo. Secondly, they were somehow mastered incorrectly, as if the LP they were taken from was spinning too slowly. Listen to the sample of ""Cheek to Cheek"" and you will see what I mean."
3,For Hardcore Fans Only,"The Hieroglyphics' CD single for ""You Never Knew"" is a subdued treat, especially for those won over by this cadre of hip-hop luminaries from the Bay Area. Complementing the album version of the title cut is producer Domino's remix, which nullifies to some extent the sweet melodic component of the song by employing a jarring backbeat that doesn't detract, but somewhat adds to the appreciation by coming from a completely different angle. The single rounds out with ""At The Helm"" and ""Heat,"" 2 unpreviously unreleased numbers that revolve around the central theme of rhyming prowess -- competent, but hardly essential."
3,"Average reading... not a bad book, but not the best, either","I found this book to be mildly interesting, but certainly not the best book I've read. I found it to be a bit dry at times, with too much focus on the police, FBI & Secret Service personnel and too little on the criminal and his crimes."
2,Not worth the money,I found this book to drag on so much that I never finished it. It was just simply too full of facts and was a complete bore to read. I get enough required dry reading material in my college courses.
1,"Error filled and unreliable, but interesting.","Unfortunatly, this book is so full of errors and mistakes, plus just poor editing from the 1st to the 2nd edition, that it is an unreliable source of factual information for a serious baseball fan. While some of the quotes from notable baseball pundits are interesting and often humorous, and the historical pictures are worth looking at, the ""facts"" are so questionable that you should take them all with a grain of salt. The author does not purport that this book is a reference book, but some of the mistakes are just plain unexcuseable for any author and his editor. Buy it only for casual reading...and don't make any bar bets on the facts, because you may be a loser...just like the books editor."
4,"Gray Matter, Piece of mind","Finally a band who's not afraid to release a rock album void of a DJ samples and electronic beats. GMG sounds contemporary with out the trappings of todays recycled trash rap metal hybrids. Real rock still exists! From the heavy stomping riffs of Gray Matter's opening track ""Decide"" to the sweet verse, chorus of ""R+R"", Gun Metal Gray delivers the goods convincingly start to finish! This rock fan has found piece of mind knowing that a new rock revolution may have begun!"
5,It's OK,"I think their last one was better. This one makes my toes moveand all, but the last one really made me want to kick something. I guess [they've] ... mellowed ... out too much."
3,Very solid album,A very solid album. I was not very familiar with the album and it is not the masterpiece of a Something Else or Arthur or Village Green but very good nonetheless. I enjoy listening to these 70's concept albums the Kinks did and buy one when I can afford it. Pleasantly surprised.
5,Kinks Classic,"What can you say about Schoolboys in Discrace? A timeless classic for a timeless band. If you owned in on vinyl, you owe it to yourself to update and keep it in your collection."
2,disappointing,"I love the Kinks but if yer looking for something like ""Something Else"" or ""Face to Face"" you'll be disappointed..."
1,Major mistakes I want Refund,"This book has so many editoral mistakes throughout the book, talk about making me feel smart for catching on, but isnt this book supposed to help people not confuse them and make studying harder. I am outraged that this book was released without editing. I would love to get a refund..and will never purchase McGraw-Hill again."
1,Never recieved,I bought this and never recieved now granted it was used and so I guess not recieving it isn't amazon's fault but I never recieved it.
2,Not Everything you need to know.....,"While I appreciated the simple format, and agree their is a need for a precise book that speaks directly to teens about this important topic, I would NOT recommend this particular book to anyone! Among other faults, it minimized the importance of breastfeeding and the magnatude of abortion."
2,LIFELESS RETREAD,"HAPPY HELL NIGHT takes you places you've been before and there's nothing really remarkable about this 1992 release. A top billed Darren McGavin has little do in the movie and that's a shame since McGavin starred in the superior NIGHT STALKER series. Sam Rockwell also has a small role as the younger McGavin who opened up a portal of hell when he was a college student and released a deadly spirit priest. The director tried some Freddy Krueger joke gimmicks but they fall flatter than the proverbial pancake. The movie's plot jumps around so much it never makes coherent sense, leaving HAPPY HELL NIGHT just another entry in the countless teen slasher flicks and not that imaginative of one."
3,Happy Hell Night,"This movie could have been one of the creepiest films of all time but it was mostly wasted. The lead villian looks and sounds creepy but he's reduced to Freddy Kruger style puns. The puns are so predictable that after a few times you can guess what he's about to say. The guy carrys a pick hammer, which he swings, but you only see the aftermath of it. The ending could have been seen from miles away. Is it good? Yes. It is worth checking out? Yes.Overall, despite a few flaws, this is still one good movie. However, the villian needed more lines and a better back story. I'd check it out if you're a fan of horror."
3,Worth buying if you collect slasher films,"This film can't really compete with some of the best slashers, but it's still a pretty good film. The kills don't display over the top gore, but they're still pretty bloody and the body count is pretty good. The maniac is sort of creepy and the film moves at a fairly fast pace. The film tries to be a little comedic with the killers idiotic one liners after each kill. I thought this was kind of stupid and eliminating this could've improved the film, but it's still recommended if you're a big slasher film fan."
3,"Stunning title track, but not worth it","Be There is a stunning track. The best vocal track UNKLE have ever done, in my opinion. Both the Underdog and KZA & Kent remixes are quality, too. Unfortunately the rest of the EP doesn't hold up as well. The Knock-On Effect is a middling, if interesting, thrash version of The Knock. The 3 versions of Celestial Annihilation are pretty inessential, with the DJ Assault version being the best."
1,Pfaltzgraff April Burner Covers,Product was not as described but very thin metal. It gave the appearance of a cover for a popcorn tin but the metal was not as thick. Color was washed out and pattern was a very poor copy of the original April pattern burner covers.
1,Not what I expected,"The item was not what I expected. The description said metal but it should have said ""Tin""."
4,"Great watch, cool clear band only stays clear for about 6 months then turns dingy.","I'm trying to find a replacement band for it and it's a hassle.Love the watch, just wish the replacement band was cheap and easy to find!So, I would give it a 5 star, but due to the clear band turning dingy so fast I'll downgrade it one star."
5,Better Than OEM,This charger is better than the Nikon charger. It's equally fast and more compact. The base unit plugs directly into the wall without a cord. I love that! It also includes a car charger adapter.It's also a lot cheaper than OEM!
4,Creative Bold,"Ed Littman is an original musician. The compositions, and ideas expressed here highlight that. One of the hardest things for an artist to do these days, especially on guitar is to have an easily defineable sound and identity.And Ed accomplishes that with this albumI've seen the group several times, and there is a coherent artistic fresh sound happening.Interesting for the listener and fellow player."
2,"Inaccurate, to say the least.","We bought this book prior to our moving to Korea. We have tried to use it on a number of occasions. More than half the time, the romanized pronunciation is way off. And frequentlyly the entire word is wrong. On occasion, Koreans don't even know what the word is written in Han-Gul or romanized. I think a person coming to Korea should have a book like this, but it should be one that helps native english speakers better in pronunciation. Also, the words themselves should be accurate. Sometimes the word written is the OPPOSITE of what you're trying to say. For example, the word given for a definiton for the word 'delicious' was actually an equivilent to their word for strange. You can imagine what kind of problems that would make in a restaurant or a person's home. So be careful!"
5,Good read!,"This was much better than I thought it was going to be. It had a different twist than most time travel books which made it more interesting. Well worth the money. Most importantly, it's not one of those terrible tiny paperback books. The print is easily read!Song of Isis"
3,An Okay read,"The book was okay at best. It was a very interesting premise but Alex as so annoying it took away from the story. I almost started rooting for Tem. I think it would have been much more interesting if Kirk had not rushed the ending. It would have been so much fun to see how Tarik functioned in the future. On the whole, interesting premise--adequate to poor delivery."
4,These Guys Did A Great Live Show!,"Back in the early eighties when I was in law school at UCLA, I loved running around with my sister and my law school buddies (Black and Latino and White) to the Bus Boys' live shows! Sometimes their opening act was this adorable African American singer fronting a band she called Roach and the White Boys! She was supposedly one of the O'Neal brothers' girlfriends, and she not only had a similar Bus Boys sense of humour but boy could she sing! We went practically every other weekend for a year to see them play all over Southern California - in places like West L.A., Santa Monica, Hollywood, Anaheim, San Diego! Crazy, man! Funny, theatrical, and GREAT musicians. The lead guitarist, Victor, could really seriously play! And as my sister noted, he was really cute! This is a great album by a band I really miss. Bring back the Bus Boys!"
4,been waiting for this one!!!,the busboys were a hard rock/alternative band from years ago/ this cd rocks and is very creativeadd it to your collection
4,A long wait for this CD,"Back when they were touring in support of this album, the ticket price was....minimum wage! (then about $3.30). Now 'American Worker' needs to be released."
5,LOVE THIS LITTLE BOOK.,"This work is rather realistic. For anyone who grew up in similiar surroundings, it brings on waves of nostalgia. Growing up in the Ozark Mountains was quite similar to the setting of this story. These were simpler times, for good and bad, and it is good that we have something like this to pass on to our children. The illustrations in this book are soft and wonderful. The text is quite to the point and quite readable and understandable. The book leaves much room for open discussion, although it helps a lot if you actually grew up in these conditions, when discussing it with the young ones. I find that the simple fact there there was no electricity, no T.V., no radios, no running water, etc. quite difficult for children to understand and grasp. This book helps a lot. Recommend this one highly."
1,I CANT BELIEVE THIS PIECE OF JUNK.......,"Ok I have to addmit it did look kind of sexy on my desk before it broke. heres the story, I bought this screen a couple months ago the first week it was great but then the screen bacame dim and lifeless. It flickered on and off. My screen has now become completely dead. Ive tried everything I could to fix it i even hired a professional. There is also the fact that though it may look sturdy it actually has tipped over quite a few times for me. THINK BEFORE YOU BUY THIS JUNK! AND DONT BY IT."
4,Crosby Did a Good Job Again,"Phil Crosby has a good manner of presentation, making his books easy to read and his presentations clear and easy to understand. Unfortunately, most US managers will not follow his directions as US business schools care little about manufacturing quality, only cheapness."
5,"Fast,High Quality Service",Book was in great condition; it arrived quickly and was wrapped in protective tissue within a cushioned mailing envelope. Excellent customer service!
4,"The fetish, & other stories","This is a splendid book. Short stories of Moravia are of totally different nature from most of the conventional short story writters like O'Henry or Gogol. Moravia deals with human relation - again not to the extent that it crosses the boundaries of relation and flows into the pshycological world of human feelings like Satre. He deals with the polemics of man and woman - mostly trying to manage through the grey background of their daily mandane matters. Little friction often is the source of firest fires destroying family or little frictions which die out after a small flash. What ever the case may be he dscribes it beautifully. Well translations have their own little problems but alas I never knew how to read Italian. All the stories have very small canvas and deal with few characters. Some stories are notable like ""Insomnia Together"" , ""All Right"" ""Family Life"". I have not given it full 5 stars as I feel the translations could have been better"
4,Classic Soul with a New Jack Swing touch.,"The gorgeous ballads ""The Best Of Me"", ""This Time"" and (especially) ""Quiet Guy"" all deservedly got plenty of airplay on Quiet Storm radio programs. While classified by many as a New Jack Swing group the truth is that Kiara's ballads and mid-tempo numbers were very much classic Soul-flavored and thus were well received by many. This was a very strong album which still sounds wonderful today--the only thing (desperately) missing was a major crossover hit."
2,"Useful, but ...","I think this book teaches you the basics about script formatting, but sometimes you get the impression the author is doing guesswork instead of delivering valid information. And the funny thing: Even some of the examples are wrongly formatted."
5,Excellent,"If you are interested in the Ayurvedic lifestyle and in Ayurvedic health, this is one of the best reference books you will ever find. Each recipe is coded by body type: Kapha, Pitta, or Vata. I use this book all the time. And the recipes are VERY easy to follow. I an not at all a great cook, and even I can prepare these recipes fairly easily."
3,book doesn't meet my expectations,I purchased the book from The Art of Books - By booksellers For booksellers. The customer service was EXCELLENT. However the book itself is a disappointment. I tried some of the receipts and found them boring. It is confusing and I believe I have better receipts and cooking suggestions in other vegan cookbooks. The seller was great and I would order from them again - if I can find them. The book was obviously used and I'm glad I didn't pay more the #2.99 for it. I don't think it is worth near the full price.
3,Ayurvedic Cooking for Westerners,"I found this book disappointing, and much prefer her previous book."
2,Low watermark,"This is perhaps the weakest Mott release in large part due to the paper thin and expressionless vocals of Mick Ralphs( unemotive on the slower tunes and straining for the notes on the rockers).There are some great songs here and Ian Hunter and all the guys are in fine form but in the end Mick's voice simply cannot carry these tunes.On it's release this disc did not recieve good reviews and this was the start of the bands demise even though they were still pulling fanatical crowds in the UK,they just could not seem to move forwards.Happily all that would change and the band would go on to enjoy some real success twelve months later with ""All the young dudes""."
4,Git along little Hooples,"Here Mick Ralphs attempts to lead the band into more genteel and countrified territiory after the gruesome sonic overload of ""Mad Shadows"". Only on the frantic live version of ""Keep a Knockin"" does the band rock out on this one.But it really works. If only Ralphs could sing, I'd give it 5 stars. Despite his singing, Ralphs' numbers are pretty good, although a bit saccharine aside from ""Wrong Side of the River"". ""River"" is such a cool song even Mick's poor vocals don't hurt it much (I'd love to hear it covered by a good vocalist).Hunter's work on this album is simply excellent. ""Angel of Eighth Avenue"", and ""Waterlow"" are cool and mellow and among the best he's ever done. If you are a Hunter fan, this album is a must. Buy it quick before it goes out of print again."
3,"Another dumb, whiny hero","Well I just hit page 428 and I think Galen, our hero, has finally stopped his [...]and moan'n. The book is more or less OK. At least the plot is not driven by his stupidity, as is often the case with these miserable hero types. It simply goes on with him whining in the background, (or foreground as the case may be.)I simply do not understand why otherwise talented authors feel the need to impose these endlessly whiny heroes on us poor readers. Is it really necessary for the protaganist to be such a blind jerk? The book is really quite interesting and has a lot of potential ... especially when any of the other major characters take the forefront. But I find myself shuddering when it is once again Galen's turn to come forward and whine."
2,Slow and Uneventful,"The idea behind this novel is great: three worlds which are somehow linked together by dreams and each dreamer is a unique personality (and race). But I found the beginning of Mystic Warrior to be almost unbearable. The story progresses slower than a snail. The only reason you keep reading is because the chapters are so small (about 5 pages) that you find it an incredibly easy read. But it takes nearly 200 pages before the story really beings to progress to anything interesting. Honestly, I just recommend saving your money and buying another book."
3,Sigh,"I held off writing this review until I had read the first 3 books in this series. Of those three, this falls in the middle.The concept of three worlds (man, faerie, goblin) is interesting, but hard to pull off. The book relies on dream sequences to set the three heros in motion. In this book the dream sequences are vague enough to not get in the way of things. They work pretty well in revealing th plot. The problem is that worlds of man and faerie work pretty well. The goblin world appears populated with morons and that's being generous.It was good enough to get to the second book."
1,Mystic Boredom,"I've liked Hickman's work in the past, but I found this story rather slow.While Galen is likeable enough, he's too complacent with his 'insanity' and I quite simply didn't CARE about him OR his madness. The visions he had seemed more suitable to a Disney movie (I kept thinking of Belle with the talking broomsticks and teacups), and quite frankly I found Galen's relationship with his wife boring. (Then again, I prefer my fantasy characters to be single at least at the beginning of a story).Perhaps its my fault for listening to the audio version, which only prolonged the first section of this novel -but I found this book tedious and dry. Perhaps the sequel will be better?"
3,Blah blah blah blah,I bought this book right out when it first came out and i am still trying to force myself to finish the book so that i can stick it in the back of the collection to be forgotten about. It starts out okay but it just takes a nose dive after a while and it just doesnt get better from there on. I will borrow the next one before i go out and but it
5,A wonderful weaving of worlds,"This was the first book in along time I have actually gone back and read again in the same weekend. I enjoyed the Goblins and hope to read more of there world ""Mimic for President"". I would recomend this book as a fine read with a pint of dwarven ale and a pouch of old toby. This series is definately going to be gracing the shelves of my collection. From all the Folks at Baldspats Inn we give this first book of the Bronze Canticles a rousing Cheer.ThanksBadelong"
3,"Mystic Warrior? Ha, more like Mystic Whiner.","3 worlds. One of men, dragons and dwarves. One of goblins and mechanical titans. One of elves, dryads, nyads, etc. One man, Galen, is taken as an ""Elect"", or madman under the laws of the dragonkings. He dreams of another world. The fae world. His dreams and communications within them become real. Begins the start of humanity throwing off the chains of the dragonkings. It seems that all 3 worlds are somehow going to become one and the dreams are precursor to it. It seems that communication between worlds opens up the user to a well of ""deep magic"".Good in some parts, draggy in others. Will reserve judgement until I've read the rest of the trilogy, but I am planning on finishing it. Galen annoyed me though. Whine, whine, whine."
2,Dissapointing,"Having read several of the series Tracy Hickman co-created with Margaret Weiss, I expected much of this new series.My expectations were not met. The writing style is bland and forced. The world is interesting enough, but the concept of several worlds linked together has already been done in a previous series of Weis and Hickman (the deathgate novels). A series that was way better and more entertaining.I disliked all the characters and was bored by the dream sequences. For some reason it was quite annoying that Galen spoke in first person.The ending was predictable yet slightly better than the rest of the book.I would expect this work from a fumbling beginning author not a great like Tracy Hickman. He should simply stick to working with Weis, cause their co-authored books rock."
2,A great fantasy action adventure story with no action or adventure....,"So the Hickmans have written some of my favorite stores over the years but I think they approached this knowing they wanted a ""$ Trilogy $"" so they had to stretch this one out a little too much. Not to mention my favorite storyline killer: the unlikely hero thrown into the heroic situation, which he doesn't want. Don't they all..... Why can't the main character just have the inner drive to get the bad guys and right the world's wrongs?Discussing this with my friends who have also read it we all agreed: it was a disappointment.That said, I went out and picked up the second in this series in paperback last week in hopes that this series does get better."
3,"Slow beginning, but it gets better","This was a good book. It took a while to get into it at the beginning, but it gets better. Once the story got going I found the magic system interesting, and the way things just happen between the dream and the real world are great. The ending just leaves you hanging, and since the next book starts 10 or 15 years later I wonder how things pan out between the two books."
5,Looks great,"This is a gift for my granddaughter, but this is exactly what I was looking for. She has a guitar, and the desire, this will help her learn some of the skills."
2,Computer dictionary's are difficult to keep current,"Because of the popularity of the Internet, computer's have become very popular. The technology has leap-frogged several times during the past year.This book has a lot of dated terms that do not apply to today's environment. An example is: Hayes Compatible Modem. The Hayes Company and the Hayes brand are now defunct.XML is not mentioned as a computer term. Other new terms are not mentioned either.This subject changes too much to have a good guide in paper form."
4,YOUR EARLY COMPANION,"If you are an average computer (or Internet) user whose requirements include a portable Computer/Internet Dictionary, I will recommend this one. It is handy, concise, and easy-to-use. But, if your computer knowledge is advanced, it will be wise to look for something else. This dictionary will not be of much benefit to you. It has a beginner's outlook; and offers a modest 2,500 definitions."
4,Recommended,"Barron's Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms is a good computer/internet dictionary and rather inexpensive. Although there are not some updated terms in the dictionary, I'm sure they will be included in the next edition. I believe the context is comprehendable for beginner computer users up through near-advanced computer users."
1,Not Up To Date,"I bought this hoping to be able to get simplified explanatios of high-tech terms for use in my writing. What a waste! It doesn't have definitions for some of the newest Internet and computer terms, and the definitions it does have are way too complicated for the average human. I keep looking up words, hoping for the best. Invariably, I am disappointed. Try Microsoft's Computer Dictionary - it's easier to understand and more complete."
2,Annoying...,"As a general computer dictionary I would rate this as 3/5 stars. Although, all-in-all, this is suppose to be an up to date terminology reference for Internet terms as well...not really up to date in that department unfortunately either. As for a programmers reference...look elsewhere! For example, there is a definition for CORBA; but no definition for COM or COM+! Not very well thought out...look to another book for a more complete vocabulary."
4,a solid worth while source book,"This is the latest in the Barron's Business Guide on Computer and Internet terms. It is up to date has has over 3200 key terms made easier to understand by diagram, pictures or examples (as in programming). There are some terms not covered for some reason such as the types of networks, only a generic reference that if you were looking up networks you would know anyway. I hope they correct this over-sight and add more network terms but otherwise a very useful and helpful book."
5,A Terrific Resource,"This dictionary is quite useful, handy, and informative for anyone who is even the least bit curious about computer terminology.Compact-sized, fits in your pocket and/or computer case or backpack. This little gem will help make you much more knowledgeable on the topic. Once you learn the lingo, you'll immediately know what is being talked about, because this book covers and explains abbreviations and illustrations are fairly plentiful. If you are a novice or even somewhat experienced, this is a great book at a greater price and deserves to be in you library."
2,MCSE (Microsoft Certified SOFTWARE Engineer)!?,"That is just one example of the many errors in this book. Note: For those new to modern technology, MCSE stands for Microsoft Certified SYSTEMS [not software] Engineer -- systems engineers and software engineers have very different roles. Hopefully, the next edition will be edited before going into production."
5,Lorie Rocks!,"I'm not French, and I don't speak French either, but this is an amazing CD. I heard Sur un Air Latino on a plane to France, and I have been addicted ever since!I recommend this CD to anybody."
5,Exellent,"Be warned, once you listen to Tendrement, you will not be able to stop!!! This album is addictive and Lorie is so enchanting. If you are a fan of French music, make sure this album is in your collection, it's a classic!"
1,Repititious Blur,"I accidentally came across this book while browsing through the history section. As a history student it looked interesting. I got about twenty pages into the book when I just gave up. The reader is bombarded with seemingly useless, repititious facts and the cast of characters/survivers becomes one large blur. Not to mention that the story itself becomes lost in the midst of the author attempting to connect everyone and everything in London during this time. Overall, I would not recommend this book."
2,My Laundry List is More Interesting.,"I bought this book having read the book cover where one reviewer talks about Mortimer's ""gripping narative"". Where?From beginning to end, it's dull, dull, dull. It reads like a laundry list. Mortimer drearily goes from one person's account of the events of that evening to another person's account, with flat explanations of what happened. And because he doesn't paint a descriptive picture of each person he introduces, I was constantly confused about who was who. And, also, why did I care? I'm sure if I had met those people personally I would really have cared about what happened to them - but, because Mortimer made them all sound so uninteresting, I frankly didn't.This evening was one of the great events in London's history, but I didn't get that at all from the author's narrative. It reminded me of yet another boring history book I read in school. Not recommended."
5,a truly beautiful mind :),Mr. Tomonaga deserves that expression more than others because of his sensitivity and sweetness (if such things can be said about physicists ;) .. the book speaks for itself and is a 'must read' for anyone interested in physics or the history of physics :) enuf said ;)
3,Underwhelming,"I'd heard about Warren Miller's films and this is the first one I tried. It won't be the last, but overall the movie was pretty disappointing. It could be this isn't holding up well with the passage of time. The comedy is cornball stuff. The ski/board runs are a bit tame. The narration is largely on the dull side. Some of the music is good but otherwise I didn't find much particularly noteworthy."
3,boring,"This vid is pretty tame, even compaired to Freeriders. Bad music and boring skiing (for the most part) -> GET GLOBAL STORMING IF YOU WANT A REAL SKI MOVIE!"
5,zep football,"very pleased with item, can't get anything like this in the u.k. unless its a poor quality bootleg. very favorable with good exchange rates in my favor."
3,"Nice Jersey, But....",Very nice jersey but it's made of cotton t-shirt like material. Nice fit. It weighs in at 9 oz which means it can ship 1st class mail for 3-4 bucks. Yet they charge $7.95 shipping.
4,"Good, not great pocket radio","Good - Small size, light weight, sound quality and battery life.Average - tuner sensitivity and selection leave much to be desired.Overall I like this radio, but I don't know that the increased price vs a comparable Sony are justified."
2,Reception is justnot great,"I bought the Sangean DT-180V AM/FM/TV Band Pocket Radio to replace a Sony digital pocket radio that aged ungracefully. I do not know how the Sangean will age yet, but the reception is a major disappointment. To be clear about it, it is only used to listen to an NPR FM station in a major city. No AM stations, no obscure radio station, no out of the way towns or remote locations. No mater where I walk, reception is consistently not good, and significantly worse than what I had with the Sony radio (which was not perfect either, but definitely reasonable). For lack of motivation to purchase another Sony radio and after not finding a better option my conclusion is that the only solution is to listen to the ""radio"" via podcasts or other forms of digitally downloaded content."
2,A neat concept but with too many short comings,"My Sangean DT-180V started out as a good miniature radio. It has good reception and is fairly sturdy and attractive. The on/off button and volume switches are the only controls that work as designed. The band selector and station scroll buttons work as designed most of the time.The station preset buttons seldom worked properly. The erratic preset button behavior got worse over time.I had to press harder and harder to get them to respond. When I pressed a button, it very often selected a station programmed for a button otherthan the one I pressed. Eventually I got used to it, I would just keep trying again to get the intended station.The other problem is that the labels for the buttons on the front of the radio wore off very quickly.(Luckily I had memorized their functions).I finally got fed up with the radio and stopped using it."
3,"I returned the item because it did not have a speaker, it could only be used with earphone",The product was fine except it was not what I was looking for. I need for it to be used without earphones.
2,Not a good camera for a child,"I bought this camera for my 7 year old and was really disapppoined with it. It was really light plastic and seemed like it could get broken quickly. The piece that holds the batteries in the bottom comes completely off and was rather hard to replace after loading them, also it could be easily lost. You also need to manually advance the film after each picture and the winder is not at the top of the camera so that is also hard to do. I would not recommend this camera for kids."
4,Cheesy and delicious,As a big fan of B-horror movies I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had an interesting cast and a hilariously evil villain. Over all it quite the corny decadence worthy of MST3K any day.
4,Obscure Psychedelia from minor Liverpool band,"The Koobas (also known as ""Kubas"") originated from Liverpool in the wave of groups who came after the Beatles. They produced a string of singles on a variety of labels in the prevailing styles of whatever era the single was released in.This set consists of the Koobas' one and only LP--a low budget ""concept album"" of great psychedelic guitar rock with the tracks running together in the most classic 1967/68 mode. This is a good entertaining set, but do not expect soul because the Koobas definitely were not doing soul music by this time. The extra tracks include the Mod classic ""My Face,"" the overblown psychedelicized version of Cat Stevens' ""First Cut is the Deepest"" and the one song which can lay some limited claim to the soul designation--""Sweet Music."" If you love low budget British psych rockers such as The Smoke, you will love the Koobas."
4,A fun read,A nice mix of history and fiction. The book moves at a nice pace and was a great vacation read.
2,Straight to DVD,"This is the third Manfredi book I have read, so much for making the same mistake twice (or thrice). The publisher touted the upcoming movie release, of which I believe never saw a theater. The story is sophomoric and fantastical. The author creates an unrealistic plot and employs very stereotypic and two-dimensional characters to to pull of the story. No matter how good the actors are, they can't defeat the writer's ineptitude as much as they can thwart their enemies. I appreciate Dr. Manfedi's qualifications as a historian, but that does not make him a good story teller. My suggestion--rent the DVD instead!"
3,5th century AD ramboes,"This book is Ok. The author undoubtedly holds narrative talent, but the story is rather weak, the plot development has some contradictions and in the end, (aprox. the last quarter of the book) it becomes utter fantasy (instead of keeping the historical/fictional framework it displayed from the beginning) The plot has been shaped to keep the reader engaged with Rambo-style-action (lot of hack-and-slash, running and chasing, some gore and the old-cliche hollow romance)mixed with some kind of decaffeinated suspense (the outcome for most of the situations is rather obvious). The best thing is, for me, the description of places and things: again, the author has talent for describing from a well balanced poetic/plausible point of view events like the decay surrounding, or the sentiment of the people in the time they had to live. A recommended lecture for metro stopping or a long flight."
3,Could have been great,"Maybe it is just the translation but this could so easily have been a great story.It has the key ingredients, fascinating place and time, strong lead characters, interesting twist at the end... but it just didn't make it.Why? The story didn't flow well, the narrative felt clunky and awkward, the pacing was a bit up and down, and although the ending was interesting it had become rather expected and cliche when it happened.I guess we're still waiting for that great historical novel about the last Emperor of the West."
4,A great romp,"In complete contrast to the previous reviewers I found the book an exciting and captivating read. As our great warriors treked across Europe I could visualise every battle and landscape.It reminded me of ""Raiders of the Last Ark"". I think it will make a great film one day.An excelllent piece of escapism."
4,nice,"i have nintendo ds lite in which it can play GBA games as well.. but for me, I just buy ds games, so its hard for me to look for an organizer thats why when i saw this, i immediately bought it. it looks durable and it carries 12 ds catridges! nice!"
2,Not his best,I believe I've read most of Christopher Rowleys' books and I have to say I consider just about any of them to have been better written than this one.
2,Can't hit a home run everytime.,Even Ruth didn't hit a home run every time at the plate.If you want to read some of Rowley's GREAT sci-fi then tryStarhammerorThe Vang: The Military Form. You will not be sorry. They are both great reads.
5,Not your run-of-the-mill fragrance,"This has been my absolute favorite perfume since it came out in 1969 and it is increasingly hard to find. Very unusual, light, fresh fragrance - floral, but with a warm note. This is NOT a strong perfume in any of its strengths, so it is impossible to overpower wearing this scent. I wish it lasted a little longer, but it may on different people.It seems so many fragrances from the same maker smell the same these days. This one is decidedly different and a real treasure, in my opinion. If you hate Shalimar (I do) you will be pleasantly surprised by this scent."
5,Continued excellence,"Once again the tenors do what they do best. Nerve tingling and very emotive stuff, especially after seeing Ronan's performance at the rememberance for September 11. The vocal range and selections once again show the range these three guys can reach. As I live in the UK I live in hope that maybe one day a concert tour will take place. I will be first in line for tickets. Bring on the next album."
3,If only it was THE Irish Tenor!,"This is a very nice CD. The song selection is very good. The first song ""Isle of Hope, Isle of Tears"" alone makes it worth owning. However, this CD has the same problem that all the Irish Tenors' performances have. On the one hand, Anthony Kearns has one of the most melodic voices on the planet. If he would make a solo CD I would buy it knowing little about it. When playing this CD I experience disappointment when he not singing. On the other hand, there is Ronan Tynan. This man's life story is surely inspirational, but he does not sing very well. Sometimes he shouts. His voice sometimes cracks. He sometimes sings through his nose. He struggles through songs. By himself, his limited vocal skill would be apparent. Juxtaposed with Anthony Kearns, it is painful. Since the only way I know to get Anthony Kearns on a CD to buy Irish Tenor recordings, this CD is worth it. However, let the buyer be warned of the less than satisfactory listening minutes that come with him."
3,Where is the Ellis island song?,"I originally bought this CD after listening to the performance during the Yankee Stadium tribute after 9/11.I wanted to find the version of the song he sang about Ellis island. I found a song similar called Isle of Hope Isle of Fear, but it still wasn't the same as the version I remember hearing.The CD is of excellent quality and lots of good soothing songs. But does anyone know where I can find the Ellis island song from the Yankee stadium memorial concert?"
5,Ellis Island: The Irish Tenors,"This is the best album yet! All three tenors are in fine voice, and the orchestral arrangements show Frank McNamara's expert touch. Highlights are ""Macushla"" and ""The Croppy Boy"" by Anthony Kearns -- whose voice continues to improve. He can raise goosebumps when he hits notes like high C and high B flat. It's unbelievable how the clarity and sweetness of his voice adds to a song. Finbar Wright is superb In ""Slievenamon"" and ""The Old Bog Road"" to both of which the mature quality of his voice and his mellow sound is eminently suited. Ronan Tynan's rendition of ""The Green Fields of France"" is enough to make everyone go out and end war for ever. The Gaelic medley is wonderful -- the blending of their voices is better than ever and the climactic ""God Bless America"" is the icing on the cake. Buy this CD; you won't regret it."
4,A great read,"This is an interesting look at the power of film, and what affects it can have on a family. As an attorney the first amendment issues were interesting to think about. I enjoy the characters of the series, and the suspense of the books."
5,Engrossing,"This is a fascinating novel with a number of important elements.I found it to be a excellent piece of fiction, with strong characters and an interesting story line. As a legal/mystery novel it stands on its own as a very good thriller. However, it has added interest in addressing issues related to the first amendment, the pornography industry, and a variety of psychological aspects. I appreciated that the author was able to discuss the subject matter in sufficient detail to convey the message, without gratuitous use of the sexual content. All in all I strongly recommend this book to people who like legal thrillers."
5,Marianne Wesson's Chilling Effect,"Another powerful and gripping novel by Marianne Wesson, with a very unusual storyline. I have read both her earlier books and enjoyed them thoroughly. Cinda Hayes is one of my favourite characters, gusty, smart and sympathetic. I was very disappointed to learn that Wesson has only written three books. I wish there were many more."
4,Enjoyable!,"Truly one of the most fascinating and enjoyable books on film history. However, there was one disappointment - mainly Harvey's chapter on the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers movies. It struck me as an essay on 1930s musicals and he does not give much credit to Ginger Rogers' contribution to the dance team."
4,A Very Good Start,A very good book. The only critical thing I would say is that it lacks boat building terms and does not use WoodenBoat magazine as one of its many fine references. I saw the book advertised in the WoodenBoat catalog and assumed it would help in my new boat building project. I am still looking for a resource. It still has 2000 other terms. Not bad.
5,"""The perfect addition to your nautical library""","From THE LOG, Southern California's boating magazine, July 3, 1998: ""It's hard to believe the amount of information that's packed into this volume.... A useful tool for beginning sailors and proven seamen.... Brings readers up to date on modern boating language.... Easy to read."""
3,Not a dictionary for newbies!,"For a small book, this dictionary covers a lot. Unfortunately, many of the definitions use terms that are not themselves defined elsewhere in the dictionary, breaking a reasonable and inviolate rule that definitions should give a clear, freestanding explanation. Spending a little time to cross-reference the definitions themselves, to see that they are also in the text would be welcome. Some definitions are so short as to be useless to anyone who is not already an ""old salt."" The illustrations are welcome and well done."
1,Your own best customer?,"You suck for writing your own ""customer"" reviews (three of them no less). I bought your book anyway though."
2,Picture is misleading,"I was disappointed to find only one band in the package. The picture and title ""cords"" (plural) led me to believe that all three were included. Had I known, I would not have ordered this product. There were others with a lower price that included a workout guide. This one comes with nothing extra."
2,perpetuates racial grievances,"The artwork in this book is very appealing. The seemingly simple illustrations convey expression and mood. Remarkable.But...Jackie Robinson was black.Jackie Robinson was black.Jackie Robinson was black...And don't you forget it!That seems to be the message of this book. Was Jackie nothing more than a black man? Should that be my main takeaway from this book? Jackie was black, really? No other accomplishment gets nearly the emphasis in this book as his skin color. How aggravating -- do we have to just bludgeon that fact home again and again? What a waste of an illustrator's talent - this book could have been so much more.Some non-standard English grammar (""I ain't never""..."" ""my dad and me...""). Great illustrations."
2,Not what I expected,"While I did receive a Websters New World Thesarus it does not look like the picture used to advertise the product. My expectation was that it would be the leather bound June 1999 version--it was not the item I ordered. In fact, I was sent a blue hardcover to add to my home library. If I had wanted that I would have purchased locally. As it is I have a product that I didn't order, tabs that are falling off, and an eyesore on my shelf."
4,"Great thesaurus, easy to use","I prefer the old style that had two sections to reference. Well, I may be a bit biased because I also love the smell of an old book. But aside from that, this thesaurus is complete, very extensive, and easy to use. A powerful tool for any writer from scientific to fiction."
5,A must for a writer,I purchased this item for my wife who is a writer. She uses it constantly and swears by it.
5,Good Thesaurus,This thesaurus is really good. It does a really good job of finding good words to use instead of other words that aren't as good. They do a good job of putting the words in order and make it easy to find the good words to use. Over all this is a good purchase.
3,Not what I ordered,"This book is exactly what I needed for college, but the only problem is; I don't like soft back books! I ordered a hard back book and received soft back. I am disappointed, they do not last as long as hard back. By the time I am finished with my degree my book will be in really bad shape."
3,Solidly Written Police Procedural--minus the sparks,"This is a by-the-numbers, well written and plotted with good characters police procedural. Many readers enjoy this style of book because everything is orderly, logical and expected. The trouble with that is it easily can become plodding and average. The author carefully keeps to reality, modern day, with no ""bells and whistles"" or outrageous components requiring the reader to suspend belief. The romance between the lead characters is something to anticipate but it comes way too late in the story and wraps up quickly. This book could be recommended to anyone from an older teen to your grandfather and they would enjoy it. But for an experienced reader, a better book using the characters of a wealthy male businessman and a dedicated female cop is any of the Roarke-Eve Dallas series by Nora Robb. Understanding in advance, that it would be like comparing an orange to a candied kumquat--both equally delicious, but requiring a different taste expectation."
1,tales of the abyss,VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD. I THOUGHT IT WAS A MUSIC CD IT IS NOT. NEWBURY COMICS WILL NOT TAKE IT BACK. BE CAREFUL BUYING FROM THEM. I WOULD GIVE THEM 0 STARS IN REVIEW.
5,Worked out well.,Quality is great. Metal tubes vs plactic will allow these gutter screws last forever. Paint on end all was good vs other vendor. Price was competitive also. I recommend these gutter screws.
5,Beautiful!,"Love it. Small, fits in my purse so I can always have it with me running around town as I make appointment and purchases for my wedding."
2,OK album. Not as good as debut album.,"After the success of their debut album, ""Adults Only,"" teh gang at Club 69 got a bit overly ambitious and put out an overly produced CD that was decent but not universally appealing.They bring back some of our favorite vocalists from teh first album but teh songs are pretty disposable. It's nice to have playing in the background but nothing that really stands out.I suggest you buy the debut, ""Adults Only."""
3,Modern Greek,"If you want to learn Greek by audio book , don't buy this product . When you will want to continue learning and will want to buy the next lessons you will see that it is not posible to buy NEXT lessens and you must to buy again all CD's that you already purchased , So buy directly the ""Modern Greek I"" with all this CDsIt is OK for informations ,to get the notion of what is Greek language"
5,Pronunciation Experts,"I used other cd's for a trip to Turkey and Greece. The Pimsleur method of teaching pronunciation from back to front proved to be amazing. We were complimented throughout our trip for pronunciation. They've got a system that works. I recommend combining their CD's with the ""Idiot's Guide"" Books for reinforcement. Good Luck"
1,Incompetent customer service,"I ordered the Modern Greek Pimsleur program. What do they send me? Hebrew. In the box, there is a receipt for the Greek language program, yet some incompetent and careless person working there sent me the wrong order. This is infuriating.This company ought to have better quality control. This is time lost that i will never be able to recoup.Frustrated with"
5,It is amazing how simple it is!,"I have a 4 month old daughter and I am excited to get started with Glenn Doman's Math, Reading and Encyclopedic Knowledge. My Husband and I are both teachers and see children struggle every day with reading and math, especially fractions. If we can give our daughter a head start, it is more than worth the time it takes to create the materials.I found that a Red Bingo Dabber works great for creating the math dots. Not only is it cheap, it makes it very quick and easy to create the math cards. I did 100 in 20 minutes. The reading cards take more time, but it is less time than I usually put in creating classroom materials."
2,194 pages of drivel before any instructions.,"I was pretty disappointed with this book. It was recommend by a co-worker, so I bought it. There are 194 pages of anecdotes about why its a good idea to use the exercises in the book before one gets to the first exercise. This sort of thing is usually covered in the introduction, or maybe the first chapter, but not the first 15! Does anyone really need that much convincing *after* buying the book?"
5,Insightful!,"I discovered this book eleven years ago as a new mother. I was amazed and delighted to find out the wonderous ways that my baby's brain worked. I followed the 'essence' of the book - tempering it so that it was always low-stress and joyful and following the suggestions according to our daily mood (not the rigid schedule suggested). We modififed the suggestions so that everything was fun - she always begged for more. Fast forward to today...I have three children, ages 7,9 and 11. They are all happy, confident, independent and secure. They are all outstanding athletes. They all attend school in a gifted program and excel as students. But even more - they love school, they love to read, they love learning. Do yourself and your child the favor of a lifetime - read this book!"
5,I was there!!!,"There is something special about going to a Rockapella concert that is different from the average concert experience. Not only do these five gentlemen make you smile and give you gooseflesh with their voices, but they are just so darn nice that you have to love them. Each member has something wonderfully unique to bring us. The day of the concert had to be exhausting for these guys and there they were thrilling us for 2 1/2 hours!!! This CD really makes me feel like I'm back at the Lobero theater, it captures a great deal of the magic of that evening. If you've never been to a Rockapella concert, buy this CD! It certainly is the next best thing to really being there."
3,The Complete Reference C#,"Herb Schildt is my favorite programming book author. I like this explanations and his method of evolving the subject he is teaching. The C# complete reference, 2002 has several errors that have perplexed me for hours causing me visit the osborne.com web site.At the site, I found no listing for this book, but Schildts' other great books are listed.It appears Osborne has given up on this book! Why don't they list the book and why do they not have an erratum on this book?Schildt is a great author but Osborne is not a good publisher! If you can, wait for his new C# book."
3,"""Complete"" is misleading","The title ""Complete"" Reference is misleading, because the book is definitely not complete. Schild does his usual good job of explaining C# syntax and construction; in this respect, this book is one of the better ones. However, his almost parenthetical discussion of actually building applications - which is what most C#.net programmers want to do - is woefully inadequate. There are a number of C# idioms which are very useful to know and understand in the building of C# applications, and Schild doesn't even attempt to cover them.If you want a book to learn C# syntax, this is it. If you want a book which will teach you how to build applications, definitely look elsewhere!"
3,Average at best,"Unfortunately, Herb seems to have written this book with another language in mind, perhaps Java, C? I say this because his explanations of topics seem so generic that you'd forget your even reading about .net. That's not good. I've read several other C# books that do a much better job of pulling me into the .net world. Also, Schildt apparently made a blatant decision to not code accoring to the recommended MS standards of camel and pascal case. This is very annoying. Other books even take the time to tell you exactly what these standards are. Herb does not. I get the feeling he just recycled some material from past books and rushed this out the door. If he even wrote any of this book at all, who knows. Look elsewhere folks."
3,"Erudite meditation on power, would've like more bio though..","I was recently in Prague and having read a Havel play (and being a fan of Kundera and Klima) I felt like I needed to know more about the man Havel is. Fortunately I am also interested in the machinations of power structures and how humans spin their webs. This was the main theme of this book, and Havel was it's main character. The chapter about Havel in jail was riveting, but I must say, throughout the book, I would have like more detail regarding the important stories that add dimension to his life, so I would say I should have read something else. Still, Keane's intelligence and insight connect Havel's life with the historical context from which he arises very well. I would say that this it the books greatest strength. I learned a lot, though not always about Havel."
3,Not his best...,"I was very excited to receive IMPACT in the mail from Netflix, but was disappointed in Miller's latest effort. After such gems as COLD FUSION and STORM, this film didn't quite live up to the sequences of his previous films.The Chamonix sequence was excellent, as was the sequence of snowboard jumping at Mammoth, but the film didn't have as much of Miller's dry humor or 1950s ski nostalgia, and I missed the obligatory base jump sequence, such as the spectacular winged suit jump from the top of the Eiger (in STORM, I believe). The soundtrack was not as stellar and varied as before. I simply was not as wowed as I was by his previous films. I hope this year's HIGHER GROUND returns to his more exciting, better shot films."
2,Too commercialized and....,"I bought this movie without seeing it first and have now watch it at least two times through. Some chapters, I watch several more times.This movie has three things against it. First, I was very disappointed with the number of product placements in this movie. It takes alot away from the whole movie. Second, it has too much of the same stuff that can be seen in any recently released WM movie. Same people doing the same exact things. Third, the sound track was way below par.I'm still a Warren Miller fan and the movie does have some good ski footage. But, I don't think the WM bunch went out of their way to make this a good ski movie."
2,Disappointing,"After 'Shiver' I expected this to be no less cutting-edge. However, if I listened to 'Shiver'for ten times, I did to 'Brave' only once. Not worth your money, save them for 'Shiver'."
5,Country Music,I Enjoy listening to music and the CD is a great artist! The Cd is a great Cd for learning the words of different songs you enjoy singing!
3,"Great Voice, not so great songs...","I like two songs on this album, Somebody's hero, and Trying to Find Atlantis, but not sure where she is going with the rest of it. The songs don't really stick with me or make a big impression. Great voice, just needs the right song. ""There is no Arizona"" had a great melody, and story but this album lacks what that song had."
3,Brave,"Jamie O'Neal has finally released her second album. Originally slated to be released in 2003, she suddenly left Mercury before it's release, and the album remained unreleased. A few of the songs make an appearance on BRAVE, including ""When Did You Know"", ""On My Way To You"", ""Ready When It Comes"" and the first single ""Tryin To Find Atlantis"". They are all fine songs in their own right, but the rest of the alubm doesn't follow up. In fact the only other songs I like are the title track, ""Follow Me Home"" and ""Girlfriends"". The rest of the album is lackluster at best. ""Naive"" tries to have that nostalgic feel to it, but the lyrics just ruin the song, it just doesn't fit like it should. ""Somebody's Hero"", the second single, is a bland anthem for mothers. This is a real disapointment, since we had her marvelous debut album SHIVER, this doesn't even come close."
4,"Jamie is learning how to be ""Brave""","Jamie O'Neal hit the country scene in 2000 with the award-winning album ""Shive"" which included the hit single ""When I Think About Angels,"" and now, 5 years later, Jamie has proved that she still has the voice and the attitude that it takes to make it big, on the new follow-up album ""Brave.""The album starts out with ""Trying To Find Atlantis,"" which is the first hit single and moves onto ""Naive,"" which is about love and just running away from true love then followed by ""Somebody's Hero."" More of the stand out tracks are ""Devil On The Left"" and ""On My Way To You."" With the new album ""Brave"" I can listen to the full album without skipping one track!! I can't wait for the next album from Jamie O'Neal. This girl has proof that you can leave and come back again with style!!"
5,Great classic series,"Thess BBC broadcasts from James Herriott's classic books are awesome. The stories are so entertaining, whether you read the books, listen to the audiobooks or watch these TV broadcasts. It really makes the stories come alive to see the vet practice acted out and the actors/actresses are wonderful in this series."
1,Outrageous price,You can get the U.K. version(33 discs) delivered to your door for under $100. A good region free DVD player can be had for $50 to $75. You do the math.
5,All Creatures,Absolutely wonderful! This was truly money well spent. Everything about the contents of this series is wonderful. The acting is superb and the stories are heartwarming.
4,Need subtitles,"My husband and I love this series and watch it over and over, but we miss a lot of lines because of the accent. B. Adams"
3,Don't let the age requirements fool you.,"As some of the other reviewers have already stated, this is a very small vacuum cleaner more appropriate for 1 and possibly 2 year olds.'I don't know why this listed under the three year old section. Having said that, my three year old does love this toy (even though she has to stoop to push it) and she plays with her vacuum constantly."
2,Over Rated,For $25 this toy doesn't do much. It is loud and only says a few things. My 18 month will play with it for a little while but it's not too exciting. I was kind of disappointed and glad I didn't pay full price.
2,disappointed,"This toy was bought for a 18 month old child. The child was excited when he saw this toy but when he tried to use it, it was too short for an 18 month old to push around. Therefore, the child did not want to play with this toy. Money wasted."
4,"Good Toy, But not hold interest","My son loved it, for about a week. We gave it to him for Christmas. He did like and still will occasional play with it but never more for than a couple of min at a time. Not worth it, and now I jsut have a large toy to store. It was the perfect size for him tho, and it was not too loud and he loved them talking to him."
3,Little girl is afraid of the noise and vibration,"This is a noisy toy and can be scary for little ones, especially with the vibration AND loud noise. We tried to introduce the giggle vacuum at around 1 year and it was BAD - screaming and crying and no fun at all! We've tried every month since then (she's 20 months now) and she'll tolerate the vacuum being out now but has no interest in playing with it. Perhaps someday she'll enjoy it. Overall it is just way too noisy, in my opinion."
3,Sized for a small child,"We bought this for our 16 month old graddaughter--it is just the right size for her, my 3 year old grandson has to bend over to push it.She does have trouble keeping it going on carpet, the handle tends to flip over so she ends up dragging it around. She has a toy lawn mower at home that she pushes all over and has a great time--I was aiming at that for Grandma's house but she get irratated with it a quits easily. I would probably not buy this again."
4,good album,"the singing leaves a little to be desired, but the playing is outstanding, he covers a lot of differnent sytles"
1,A Stone's Throw is apparently not too far,"If you're a Mick Taylor fan, then you are going to be excited when this CD arrives! Unfortunately, once I listened to it all the way through, I put it at the very bottom of one of my CD stacks, hoping to never see it again, except to show people how genius can turn into the mundane. The album has nothing; no punch, no drive. I can't say that I didn't like anything on the album, because I did kind of like one saxophone solo. When Mick first came on the scene as a teenager, he was full of Freddie King and Albert King and was possibly/probably one of the best white blues guitarists in the world! Actually, he still had it in 1979 on his ""Mick Taylor"" album (listen to Slow Blues). But over 20 years of being a session musician, and doing some gigs with Bob Dylan (yeeeech!), he just doesn't have it anymore. Buy the CD if you want to, if only to satisfy your curiosity. Oh yeah, he sings on every cut and there are no purely instrumental cuts. Geez......."
2,Mick's Best Years Ended in 1974....,"Musically, and inspirationally, this album is very, very weak. It has no drive or ambition at all. Even the guitar playing is marginal. And I like Mick Taylor. At least pre-1975 Mick. I had a lot of hope for this CD, but was very dissappointed upon first hearing it (and with subsequent listenings). The worst part are the vocals. Horrible. Why Mick insists on doing the vocals is beyond me. Friends should give him some honest feedback on that. On the larger side, maybe Mick really does need some help with production or some good old Keithian riffological guidance to bring out his best? Sorry Mick...."
5,a littlegem,"this low key, relaxed album is a pleasant journey through a variety of guitar styles: from slide guitar to wah-wah to overdriven power blues. the songs are well crafted and noticeably different from each other. 8 of the 10 songs were written or co-written by Taylor, and I recommend the first 2 cuts, "" Secret Affair"" and ""Twisted Sister"" as well as the quirky ""Lost in the Desert"". his singing style is adequate, and reminded me of Clapton . but the guitar work is extraordinary. the net result is a little gem of a album that will please any blues fan"
2,O.K.,"Haven't seen all the movies yet. So far, about 66 1/3 are o.k. But for the price, can't complain."
3,"yes they have a lot of stars in them, but not their best movies","i own most of these 50 packs and like most of them.i liked this set but felt it wasn't as good as some others. while the quality is good some of the movies are not.some may like it better than me ,so i have to say it's good just not the best."
1,50 pack movies,Save your time and money You get wehat you pay for-a lot of D movies rhat never quite made it pastthe box office.
5,"Nice work, Sony!","The added touches mean a lot to nostalgic nuts like me. As mentioned by others, the Elizabeth Montgomery intros, the bumpers and the restoring of the ending Screen Gems logo after each episode (which was also included on the 7th season set) are all very cool and add a lot to the whole package. These classic television show sets sell partly due to the retro appeal (besides their quality entertainment value), thanks Sony for recognizing that!"
4,"Almost as good as ""I dream of Jeannie""","Many of those who loved the ""I dream of Jeannie"", ""Bewitched"", ""Flipper"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens).I wish these wonderful old TV series and many others like ""Yancy Derringer"", ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance), ""Adventures of the Seaspray"" would finally be released on DVD.The Baby Boomers would be more than happy about it!!!"
3,The Last Season,"This was the worst season ever. Many of the story lines had been done during previous seasons. There has never been any chemistry between Elizabeth M and Dick S. so after Dick Y. the show went down hill. If you are a collector like me I say buy it. If your looking for a quality show, I say pass."
3,"Some magic, not a lot.","Bewitched was the number one show of its time. It was so successful that NBC had to emulate it with Dream of Jeannie, another magic-based show.That witchcraft, historically held as the worst form of behavior, was held to be noble and funny was an odd choice. They obviously were trying to undo the stereotype, as the beautiful and gracious Liz Montgomery was chosen for the lead role. People of my age might remember her from several serious roles on the Twilight Zone, of all things...The series was divided in two; she had two actors to play her husband. Most people prefer the 1st actor, but I preferred the 2nd one(i.e. the one here and in later years)."
5,high quality,"These brandy glasses are beautiful, high quality and easy to care for (dishwasher safe). I'll buy more when I expand my glassware collection."
3,Poor packaging,"Nice glasses (price is right); however, Amazon does a poor job of packaging these. The first order they sent had one of the four broken & the second order had two of the four glasses broken. They ship in small box within a larger box. The inner box is poorly packaged...I'd be surprised if any make it through shipping without some damage. Only up-side is that Amazon sent replacements in one day & that I could get a complete set out of the two shipments."
5,My favorite,"I have not been able to find a good Chocolate Raspberry coffee since Barnies quit carrying it. Absolutely love this one. The chocolate is pleasant, but not overpowering and is followed by a nice raspberry taste. Great coffee."
2,Didn't like,This is one of the worst chocolate coffees that I have ever had. I definitely will not buy again and would not recommend it.
3,A little too mild,"I love most of the flavors Perfect Potful makes. This one is a little too weak to get a repeat order. Raspberry should be much bolder and this one barely tastes like chocolate and I detect no raspberry. It's still a decent coffee, I just don't really detect the advertised flavor."
4,Good Product,Keeps things nice and hot for a long time! Had some problems with the delivery but the vendor eventually solved them to my satisfaction.
3,"Winning Stars, just three of them","The first thing that made this tape noticeable was Zig's southern accent (or Texan?) and the funny jokes here and there which were actually funnier than most other personal development speakers. The theme (the beef of the matter) however, was pretty much the same as many others. The only differing part was that he just doesn't believe we can do 'anything' with a positive attitude, but at least we can do 'everything better that with a negative attitude'. It wasn't that bad. Not."
2,I wasn't pleased with this item but.....,"Maybe I didn't read the description carefully enough, but it was much, much smaller than I had hoped it would be. 5 or 5 1/2 inches isn't very much to work with when you're putting on your makeup. The seller was most gracious in giving me a refund and there was no problem with that at all. Of course, I had to pay over $12.00 in shipping back and forth."
5,Luxor Mag Mirror,"I received this mirror for Christmas last year. It is wonderful for checking make-up, tweezing eyebrows, etc. I recently purchase another one for my daughter. She loves it. Also, her husband thinks it's great. You will wonder how you got along without it."
4,Great introductory field guide,"This is a terrific guide for the amateur bird enthusiast, and comes complete with lots of primer information on how to go about bird watching. By focusing on the most common representatives of each family branch of North American birds, the book makes classification far easier than a more comprehensive guide. For the typical bird watcher, the species covered in this book will allow for accurate identification at least 95% of the time, and you won't be wasting time agonizing over the slight differences between two subspecies. Each entry has a short descriptive paragraph that includes the size of the bird, a map displaying the range of the bird, and a beautiful color illustration that amply displays all of the identification points. A hard-core birder will no doubt prefer something more in-depth and comprehensive, but this is a great book to ease oneself into this captivating past-time."
4,deja vu- oh I have seen this before thats why,"I totally felt like I'd seen this movie before, and as soon as I saw the first review it confirmed why it reminds felt like deja vu. parts of it are like the show The Bachelor. It's a good movie, a little predictable but it's still a fun date night movie to watch with your significant other- oh, he said this movie is boring lol okay Well I say it's a cute movie :)"

4,The best guitarist you don't know,"Domenic is the BEST. A musician's musician, rock and jazz guitarist extraordinare, and member of the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. Give this a try, if you like r&b-inflected rock that's not the same old thing."
4,50% Awed 50% Bored,"The name Warren Miller is a household name for ski enthusiasts. He's built a great reputation for his documentaries of filiming skiers. This DVD collection shows skiing places all over the world and great footages of a few going down extreme slopes. What bored me most of the time is how monotonous the footages were no matter what country they take you, the shots are always at close-up range. It doesn't have that feel that you're watching that person ski down that Italian Alps or down that Scottish glens or even down our local slopes in Squaw Valley - all footages in different countries were filmed at close-up range so after a while it will get monotonous. It does get boring after 1 hour and then there's two more DVD's to go. This DVD collection is great for parties where you put it on a big screen in mute with loud music blasting from your home stereo and people having loud conversations and just happening to see footages of skiers while talking. Good collection to keep though."
5,An excellent volume!,"Elsie Singmaster, ""Gettysburg's Poet Laureate,"" has long been neglected, her books forgotten and out-of-print.This volume remedies this injustice and brings her work back into the public eye. Her spare, direct prose will strike a chord with the modern reader, as will her stories of everyday folk stricken by the terrible battle and its seemingly neverending consequences. Many thanks are due to the editor and publisher for returning this fine writer to the noticeof modern readers and the Civil War community. Her stories, once read, will not soon be forgotten; they will return to the reader at intervals and provoke more thought.Buy and read this book!"
1,Quite okay when it works,"The unit broke yesterday after only a little over one year in use. No power went throught the unit. I took the unit apart, but did not see any loose wire or burnt part. We have to throw this away.This is the third hot water dispenser we have. The first National (Panasonic) was thrown away after 10 years of use because of the deterioration of the inner lining. The unit still worked when we threw it away. The second unit Zojirushi is still in use after 4 years of use. Unit still looks like it is new.You really get what you pay for, in this case. However, considering the price vs year of use, this broken unit is actually much more expensive."
5,Great hot water dispenser,"Works very well, haven't had any troubles with it - it's not fancy, but it does the job well and saves me time by not having to boil water on the stove. Very convenient!"
2,Not as good as Zojiruchi,"I have a Sunpentown and a Zojiruchi - The Sunpentown doesn't work properly, as per other reviews here; the Zojiruchi works perfectly after a number of years of constant use. Also, the Z- uses less energy than the S- in standby mode, and probably while boiling as well."
1,"Purchased in May, Broken in November","Cheap, yes. I got what I paid for. I suggest you skip this product and go straight to the best in the market - Zojiruchi. You may pay a little more, but it will last longer than 6 months."
5,Great for trips outside the house,I like this invisible ink book. I've tried other versions and the marker is dark ink. This one is truly invisible so you can safely take it places (stores while shopping) without worrying about your kids coloring on something and ruining it.
4,I remembered the ink showing up darker,I had these as a kid and wanted it for a long flight for my toddler. He LOVED the stickers that came with it. Also having a marker that would not draw all over our house (or the airplane) is a plus. However I remeber the images (when you use the pen) to show up darker than they did....however I used these a long time ago. Great product for the price and for what we wanted it for.
4,Two Lives of Charlemagne,I purchased this book because my Latin II class was reading a excerpt in Latin from Einhard's life of Charlemagne. I wanted to see what the original version was like. I have enjoyed reading both lives found in this book. Even more interesting were the introductions to each life which talked about the authors' lives.
1,Ever had the plague? It's probably much more fun than this.,"Although summer reading alone is a pain, it is usually not that bad when the books are pretty good. However, I would classify this book more or less as pretty boring, and that alone is being kind. I thought it would touch upon interesting aspects of Charlemagne's life. Instead, it rattled off dates for page after page. I agree with the other reviewers: This was a book that was just too easy to put down and forget about."
1,If you are thinking of killing yourself read this book first,"Initially I thought that this novel would take an interesting look into the life of Charlemagne. However, after reading only a chapter I felt myself dozing off and disgusted from the vast quantities of useless facts in it. There was no climax to the novel at all. It was as if the author had written a three hundred page list of mindnumbing facts, and then tried to sell them as a true literary work. I felt as if I were reading the encyclopedia and the dictionary all at once. I would have to imagine that anything in life must be better then reading this book. It actually deserves 0 stars. Everyone should boycott this horrible novel"
3,Two Lives of Charlemagne,"Thorpe's compilation of two biographies of Charlemagne is an interesting start to understanding the Emperor's life. The book consists of a lengthy introduction by Thorpe; a biography written by Einhard, a contemporary of Charlemagne's; and a biography by Notker the Stammerer who lived sometime after Charlemagne. Einhard's biography is simpler to read and really more complete although it is much shorter than Notker's. Altogether, both ""Lives"" were an enjoyable read."
5,A Hydrangea grower,"The product was exactly what it was presented as, to wit, hydrated lime #5. It doesn't get any better than that."
1,"Plastic, cheap, junk! $500 for the worst machine ever!","This thing is the worst investment I have ever made. I had high expectations based on the companies slick advertising and quite honestly the high price. For this amount of money one expects a high, quality, refined product that will last for years. It lasted about 14 months, before it made horrible noises from the beater bar constantly hitting against the cheap plastic housing it is contained in. Plastic, is sometimes fine, but this is the cheapest type of plastic known to man, ABS, terrible, it scratches easily, and moving parts that are assembled in recesses in the plastic soon wear themselves out of their positions. Even the design is faulty, in order to clean up a simple mess with the wand attachment the cord must be unwound ENITIRELY.Save your money, or invest in a genuine quality product!"
1,Dyson: The Worst Vacuum I've Ever Owned,"A couple of years ago I convinced my husband to spend the huge bucks on the Dyson Animal Vacuum. It worked okay at first, but not what I expected. Within a couple of weeks plastic parts started falling off and the suction power decreased significantly. The brush on the bottom easily clogged with hair and was not easy to remove. I frequently had to turn the thing upside down, cut hair away and empty the plastic compartments just to get the thing to work properly. Finally, the belt broke last month. The same thing happened to my friend's Dyson and to one of our cleaning lady's client's Dyson. I will not even bother to get this vacuum repaired, because I don't want it! I will never buy a Dyson again."
1,Not happy,"Have a Dyson Animal. Thought it would be great for a golden retriever. Great if you want to stop and clean the fur off the beater bars regularly. If not, the vacuum looses its famous efficiency. After time, the seals on all its parts seem to loosen up. I'm going back to an Orek. May have a bag, but the machine does what it's supposed to. If you have an animal with long fur, forget the Dyson."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Do not buy this vacuum. I have debated for some time if I should write this or not and have decided that I should. This vacuum has been nothing but trouble since I bought it. Yes it has a warranty but can you really live without a vacuum while it is being repaired? Save your money, this is no better than the $100.00 vacuums I have owned. I agree it doesn't lose suction, because it can't lose something it doesn't have. It is also made of plastic, which breaks over time. Do yourself a favor, do the research and don't believe the hype. This is an example of what a good advertising campaign can do. This vacuum does not perform."
3,"After two years, I have mixed feelings...","I've owned the Dyson animal for just over two years, and the suction is still incredible and it is incredibly easy to keep clean. Except for the beater bar which needs all the hair and string cut out of it frequently (and I'm the only long-haired person in my family) It has a bent wheel and the hose just developed a gaping hole. I need a second vacuum anyway so that I'm not hauling this one up and down stairs and I really don't know what I want to do because I can't bring myself to spend so much money on a new Dyson. The suction is great but the overall quality of the vacuum is poor and I really can't afford to spend $500 dollars on a vacuum every couple of years. I think I'll look around before choosing Dyson again..."
5,Amazing Vacuum Cleaner,"This is only day one, and I'm already impressed with the Dyson DC14 Animal! We have an old, yellow Labrador Retriever who sheds terribly, and I was just amazed at how much hair that the Dyson picks up! It's easy to empty the canister, although I think that one would have to be careful with some of the plastic parts - that they could easily break, but I plan to be very careful with this little jewel! I waited because of the price, but especially if I have no problems with it, it will be well-worth the money!"
2,Regret buying it,"We've owned this vaccuum for about 4 years now and it worked ok for the first couple years, but now I absolutely hate it. First it is expensive to have repaired or maintained. There are two filters on this and they are each around $50 to replace. The last year or two the machine just keeps clogging to the point that I have to take a lot of time cleaning it all out. And it's not like I'm pushing it to its limits or not emptying it appropriately. Don't waste your money."
3,Not Clean,"Unit works ok ,but was very scratched and not cleaned. I took it apart and cleaned the cannister and all filters and the areas around them.I only then, could give it as a gift even though it was represented as used."
1,Save your $$$,"I bought this vacuum because I have two cats, a lot of carpeting and I wanted the best, however, I'm very disappointed in its performance. It works just as well but not better than my last vacuum cleaner that only cost 150$. For the price of the Dyson, I assumed it would pick up everything it went over, yet it doesn't. I recommend consumers to save a lot of money and buy a vacuum that's priced more reasonably as this Dyson certainly doesn't outperform other well rated cleaners!"
2,Watch out for warranty,"I was expecting a much more robust product for the money I paid for this vacuum. It performs fine, but one of the hoses kept coming loose causing it to lose suction. I eventually fixed that myself. The mini turbine head attachment stopped working a year after I bought it. For me, the mini turbine head was the best thing about the vacuum. It worked very well at picking up pet hair. I called Dyson and they said that the warranty did not cover the turbine head. If you ask me, Dyson should stand behind everything they build, not just some things."
4,Hand attachment not for the short but great vacuum overall,Overall this is a great vacuum. The hand attachment wand is very long and kind of cumbersom to use on furniture. Once of the plastic prongs broke off on the place for one of the attachments to be stored on the unit (the first day I got it). The suction is great though and overall I am very pleased. I would recommend a re furbed Dyson to anyone and already have.
5,NO REGRETS!,"A friend of mine with who owns 2 cats suggested the Dyson DC 14 Animal vacuum to me. We own 4 dogs that continually shed. We have been using a bagging Hoover which has frankly not been performing very well. The Dyson DC 14 blows away anything I have ever used or heard about!! After vacuuming the living room with the Hoover I quickly assembled and ran my new Dyson over the same area. Holy Cow!!....I filled the canister twice!! The carpet looked better than it usually does after vacuuming AND shampooing!! INCREDIBLE!! The best part is that there is NO ODOR that usually accompanied my vacuuming. I was very skeptical of spending over $500 for a vacuum cleaner, but this has turned out to be the best money I have ever spent. BUY THIS PRODUCT AND PAT YOURSELF ON THE BACK FOR THE SMARTEST PURCHASE OF YOUR LIFE!!!!!!!"
2,Dont Waste Your Time or Money,"I thought paying more for a vaccum would mean better quality. BOY WAS I wrong. Lost suction after about the first six months attachements were always falling off at odd times, the vacuum literally started to fall apart after a few years of light use. I replaced it with a $60 vacuum and am more impressed by it than this spendy model. I would say don't buy into the HYPE or the COMMERCIALS because thats all it is, is HYPE!! SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY, I wish I had. Lesson learned, you WILL NEVER see me buy another DYSON AGAIN!!"
2,Pulls stuff out of the carpet but....,I have 2 dogs and 3 cats. One of the dogs is a Golden. The vacuum does pull a lot out of the carpet but much of the golden fur gets stuck in the beater bar. I have to cut the fur out of this bar at least once monthly. I vacuum daily. I thought their may be something wrong so I sent it in for repair. I was told that with long hair dogs it is necessary to self clean the beater bar monthly. This is a real pain and negates any advantage to having a canister when I have to manually cut the fur out of the beater bar.
2,surprised,"I was very surprised to see so many very good reviews. I have wooden floors and you can see the Dyson blow the light dirt (dust kittens, small clumps of dog hair, etc.) away from the machine. I use a stick vacuum to finish the job - pick up the light dirt. Based on these good reviews we sent ours back to Dyson. I will let you know how it works when we get it back."
1,Hose Problem,"The hose component of the all the Dyson machines is poorly designed and structurally defecient. We have had a Dyson Purple machine for less than 2 years and in that time have had to replace the hose twice and it is now broken again. At $75 per replacement the machine has priced itself right out of our household. Dyson has refused to stand behind its machine on this defect, although I will pester them once again."
1,Never loses suction b/c it has no suction!!!,"Seriously? Almost $600 for a vacuum that works worse then my old basic $100 machine?? I was SO excited when my husband bought this for me, but we were both so disappointed when the suction that was so hyped up turned out to be pitiful. I had to vacuum the same spot several times before it picked up what I was vacuuming!! I mean seriously, that is basic vacuum operation. It just goes to show you that the more money you spend doesn't mean better quality!! Save your money!! Buy something else...I am still on the search. I am currently trying out the Bissell Healthy Home model - it is alot like the Dyson but cheaper and so far it has more suction!!"
2,Are you serious?,"After two years and two golden retrievers, ours is broken. I took it to the local repair shop and he said this was the cheapest worst machine he has seen in a while. He can't fix it because the part that is broken has been made impossible to get to by the cheap construction. Direct comment ""I can't believe they have even made a Dyson disposable"" very unimpressed."
3,Horrible,"Terrible, terrible design. Picks up great when it works (on cutpile carpet) but almost uselss on Berber. Constant loud grind from the clutch. Got a replacement when the first one did this, but the second does the same. A design flaw. Rue the day I bought it. Should be a one star rating."
2,What a vacuum pro has to say about Dyson vacs,"I've had this vac for a year, and have had to take in for professional cleaning twice during that time. The vacuum is very prone to clogging and blockages, especially the extension hose/wand. I asked my local vac repair guy to give me the low-down on Dyson vacs and why they require such frequent maintenance. He walked me through the many design flaws, most of them related to the bagless feature and the fact that everything in the vac is plastic and--no surprise--plastic wears down quickly. In a word, he confirmed my experience that the Dyson isn't worth the high price.Don't be fooled by the marketing: it ""never loses suction"" but its suction is poor to begin with! I liked the vac for the first month or two until I caught onto its frustrating propensity to clog up badly with ordinary use. I wished I had invested the $500 bucks in a Miele or Royal or other brand that has withstood the test of time."
1,HATE IT!,"I bought the Dyson vaccuum for myself for my birthday and have cursed it ever since. It is overpriced, heavy, unwieldy, does not transition easily from wood to rug, does not pick up small particles, and is very inconvenient to use. To utilize the attachments you must pull up a long pole that is in the handle which is attached to a hose has little flexibility and you must drag this heavy, clumsy machine around, bumping into walls and furniture. Forget about stairs -- the Dyson is EXTREMELY arkward to use. What a costly disappointment! For the price I paid, I could have had the best, most powerful, easy to use Hoover or Kenmore and still have had money left over. Forget the hype and stay with the proven favorites!"
3,you have to push the handle up pretty hard,Great vacuum. My only complaint is you have to push the handle up pretty hard to get it to stay. The power is amazing as we can vacuum a floor with our older Dyson and this one will pick up even more things from the carpet.
2,I wanted it to work,"Yes, it took away the animal hair I had in my house and for that, this machine is the best. BUT it is heavy and awkward to use. The attachments fall off easily and it seems I have lost two already. How did that happen I ask myself? I have no idea.I wanted this machine to work but I was very disappointed. I would not recommend it to anyone. They need to lower the weight and make it easier to work. I bought it because of the positive comments that were stated here. I wish I had read one like mine so I would not have wasted my money."
1,UGGHH!,"I've taken this thing in three times already on its extended warranty. ALWAYS loses suction. The last time I got it back, suction still was virtually nonexistent. I don't understand why they say this vaccuum never loses suction since it doesn't have much to begin with."
1,Clutch Issue with DC14 Dyson,"I've only owned this $500 vacuum for 2 years and now the clutch has gone out on it. I talked to a vacuum repair specialist and he informed me that oh yes this is a common problem with this vacuum. He added insult to injury when he said it will cost around $200 to fix it. If this is a common problem then Dyson should provide extended warranty for this issue or they should quit selling a very flawed product. I for one will never own another Dyson product in my life and I'll will post as many reviews as I can to warn other potential buyers. Dyson, I very unhappy with your products!!"
1,"Ridiculously overpriced, underperforming vacuum",BEWARE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK! It does not live up to its advertised ability to pick up animal hair on any surface and on hardwood floors it just blows the hair in the air and around the room more. The attachments are a joke -- they won't stay on when you try to use them. Getting the wand out to use the attachments is easy -- getting it back in correctly can take much of an afternoon.I wish I could get my money back so I could buy a real vacuum cleaner!Do not be fooled -- pass on this vacuum cleaner. It does not do what it is advertised to do on animal hair or any other material.
1,it sucks,"We bought it today and it's going back tomorrow. For $550.00 we want a $550.00 vacuum. It has no power and it is build cheap. The wand is pain. It will be hard to replace the belt when we need to and the beater bar rattles (slips) if you look the wrong way. They are correct in their ads though. You never loose suction. Well, you need to have suction first in order to loose it. We buy a miele"
5,Dog Owner Review for Dyson,"This is the best vacuum I have used from serveral standpoints. Firstly, the suction power is first rate and I don't have to breathe in the debris when I clean out the filter. Cleaning out the filter of the Hoover Windtunnel is another job unto itself and it is hard to avoid getting the dust in your face and on the floor again while cleaning it. Ugh! Also, the long wand on the Dyson enables one to vacuum the stairs from the landing below and you needn't carry the vacuum up the stairs to do so.Another important element is weight. It is noticeably lighter than the Hoover and I cannot understand the reviewer who said that the Dyson was heavy. It is not heavy and it is easy to manuver. It is also relatively quiet and does not torment my dogs with a blast of sound. Truly, I no longer hesitate to vacuum (the can it wait till tomorrow question) when I feel the floors need it. It simply has made the job easier and less complicated. Yes, it is pricey, but I am very glad I have one."
4,Dyson Hype?,The dysons are definitly heavily marketed. And since we have a cat that sheds way too much we decided to get this vaccum. It is a bit pricier than other vacuums but we bought it anyway. It works well but I dont know if it works any better than any other vaccum. The wand tool is a bit of a pain to use at times.Overall it is a good vacuum but I am still unsure if it is worth the money.
2,An honest review....really,"It's all about the marketing people...really. I've had this vacuum for a few years now. When people hear from the ads that it doesn't lose suction, they think ""awesome!"" Well great suction is great for floors and carpets, but what good is it when it makes the hand tools nearly impossible to maneuver? I mean really, you have to really strain yourself to use the hand tools. Awful design on the hose (not flexible enough to reach without pulling the whole vacuume along or tipping over). If I had to do it over again, I may have paid $150 for this vacuum but definitely not $500. Just like a lot of products out there now, the spiffy marketing campaign about the suction and cutesy design are what makes for the high sticker price, not the machine itself."
5,EVERYTHING AND MORE,"Have had DC14 for 3 yrs now and handles everything w/ ease. Have 4 dogs & 4 cats so pet hair can get out of control very easily. Easy to use, on-board tools are great and the long flex hose reaches everywhere I need to go. No breakdown problems or other problems. Like it better than my old Hoover or Kirby G6. Would not hesitate to recommend this cleaner to anyone. Expensive but worth it!!"
1,Not worth the money,This vacuum is not what it is advertised to be. The first two weeks it worked great although it is heavy to push around and then it was impossible to push either forward or backward. I called Dyson and they had me remove two rubber strips from the bottom and it seems to work a little better now but I would never buy another one. The wand is a nightmare with hardly any suction at all and the accessories keep falling off if you bump anything even slightly... So not worth all the money for the name Dyson...My phantom that I have had for 13 years is a much better vacuum and still working great so I will go back to using that.....
1,Was Considering Dyson but NOT NOW,"After reading all the customer comments, old and new, I have decided NOT to buy a Dyson. We have 2 Shelties. We have hardwood, stone and tile floors with large area rugs. I'm tired of cutting hair off the roller and seeing clouds of dust come out of the vacuum bag, bucket, or whatever. I'm going to shop around more. Anyone have BETTER suggestions?"
5,Dyson DC14 Animal is Awesome,"This is simply the best vacuum ever for picking up pet hair off of everything. The carpets, the furniture, the car. The first time we used it, was right after we had vacuumed with our old cannister machine, we could not believe how much more dirt and pet hair this machine was able to pick up. Simply awesome. Worth every cent."
5,Dyson DC14 Vacuum --- A Must Have !,"This vacuum is well worth the money spent. I have two dogs and plenty of hair to sweep up every day. This Dyson works wonderful. The unit is very quiet, lightweight, easy to use and best of all it is easy to dump the dirt canister with no messes. This vacuum in hands down better than the bagless Hoover I had before. Everytime I used the Hoover the suction became less and less. With the Dyson you can tell by the way the carpet looks that loosing suction is not even a question. One other great feature is the lifetime HEPA filter, this will save tons of money in the long run. I had to replace the Hoover HEPA filter every six months and that cost $30 each time... not very cost effecient. This vaccum lives up to everything Dyson claims it will do!!"
5,"If this vacuum had a pulse, I'd marry it.","I could care less about the price of this vacuum because it is the single greatest cleaning machine I have ever seen. As an impulse shopper, I'm completely ignorant to comparison shopping, consumer reporting and other such things, which probably makes me stupid but I don't care...the point is that I just let my girlfriend move into my relatively clean house with her super- hairy-shed-machine dog (further evidence of my stupidity I'm sure)...and the Dyson Animal could, has, and will time and again save this relationship. It sucks up colossal filth and debris that you couldn't possibly imagine you've been living in. I was completely and utterly shocked by it's sucking power. I'm not kidding, it's awesome. If you can get past the dichotomous (although quite humorous) nature of loving something that completely sucks, buy the Dyson Animal."
5,Roar,I LOVE this vaccuum. I have never felt this way about an appliance before. It picked up dirt I couldn't even see. Well worth every penny.
5,The Best Ever,"I have heard alot of reviews about the Dyson vacuum from pet ownersbut when my son gave me a Dyson 14 for my birthday a few days ago I usedit for the first time. Wow!!!I had a Kenmore canister and thought it wasa good vacuum, but the Dyson brought up stuff, ie: dog hair, dust, dirt,from carpet that looked clean. I have asthma and to think I was breathingthis stuff is unbelievable. Thanks go to my son and to Dyson for thismarvelous vacuum.Corgi and Aussie owner in Colorado"
2,It's great... when it works,"I would recommend that you make sure that you have a Dyson repair person nearby before you make this purchase. In the two years that we have owned a Dyson, why have spent close to the equivalent of the purchase price in repairs. This vac picks up the dog hair as it promises, but don't go near a rug with fringe. When the fringe is pulled in by the roller, the belt will snap before you even have time to shut off the motor. And the limited two year warranty is exactly that... limited. We traded ours in for a Sebo."
2,Great if you don't need attachments,"The only (BIG) problem for me with the Animal is that it will NOT fit under beds and sofas and dressers and the attachments do not move at all well over the carpet. And it is so strong that it shuts off or eats bath rugs...So, while it may be the best cleaner FOR WHAT IS OUT IN THE OPEN it gets an F from me for cleaning under furniture. So really my room is not clean at all, when all the dust mites and dust remain under my bed. It still has all the problems of a clumsy upright with a bunch of attachments that rarely get used because it is such a hassle to stop everything and ""attach"" the attachments. UGH - still dusty in Virginia."
5,"I love all animals, including this one!!","I would've never thought I would have an emotional attachment to one of my cleaning supplies...but I have been proven wrong by my Dyson Animal Vac! I love this vacuum. This vacuum not only sucks all the crap thats buried deep in my carpet, but it does it well, and it does it QUIETLY compared to my Eureka. It didn't even phase my dog or my lovebirds! The amount of crud that showed up in the barrel amazed me. I don't believe I was lying around on such a dusty carpet! The animal vac comes with a lot of accessories to boot--my one gripe is that it's a pain in the behind to switch them in and out. Also, some of the accessories don't attach to the vacuum--but to get my carpet that clean...wow, it's worth it."
2,"Great Ad Campaign, Doesn't Deliver","Dyson's got a great advertising campaign. I bought the Dyson Animal DC14. It does have great suction and only clogged once in the 5 years I owned it...but it doesn't work on hardwood or tile floors (even with the special attachment) and I was disappointed to find that the animal hair attachment is not really self powered and didn't work very well. The beater bar had to be cleaned every time I used it and while it seemed to pick up dust from the carpet, it would not pick up anything else so I'd end up having to pick up bits of dirt, etc. that it would leave behind. I finally got rid of it when it started making a deafening noise that couldn't be fixed.It was so expensive! I honestly tried to work with it but it never really was a good vacuum. I would never buy another."
5,Loved it!,"This is one of my favorite Spike Lee movies. Story of an aspiring actress who refuses to do nude scenes, gets 86'd from her acting career, and becomes a telephone sex operator. Great cameos with Madonna, Spike himself, Quentin Taratino, with great music from Prince. Translation to DVD is excellent. Highly recommended"
1,just cause of madonna i bought this dvd,this film bored me to tearsi just bought it cause madonna makes a cameo appearance
1,Questionable movie,"I found the movie unpersuasive, repetitive, boring and unattractive. The plot is not quite integrated, does not ""flow,"" and has twists and turns that do not make much sense. Acting is mediocre. Props. are generally OK, but not much more. Music is OK."
2,Uneven and Inaccurate,"The film had uneven humor throughout and little accuracy in it's portrayal of the phone sex industry. I am in the phone fantasy business and ""Girl 6"" is largely fantasy. While callers do indeed have a racial bias and many quirks; offices never are even half that nice and working from home isn't scary. Although I suppose there are girls who give their personal number out to callers and obsess over their work; most of us are well adjusted educated women with normal homes and families in suburbia who keep a safe distance from our clientel."
2,Fair,"Girl 6, directed by Spike Lee is a film which takes several dark bizarre turns. This film, which centers around the events of a young woman's passion to become an actress. (Played very well by the attractive Theresa Randle), Girl 6, becomes frustrated and broken, she takes a job as a phone sex operator. The job becomes her center-point as it sets a tone of dark strange obsession for her life. Interesting premise, the film is overlong, uneven and there is a lack of passion throughout its length. Spike Lee's character provides minimalist comic relief in a film that is not meant to be comical. Excellent cinematography. The Prince music is a plus. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
1,Spike drops da bomb,"Girl 6 is, to put it bluntly, a mess of baffling proportions.The stunning and talented Theresa Randle rises as far above the material as she can. But Suzan-Lori Parks' script is implausible as drama and too silly for comedy. And even the great Spike Lee's direction is uncharacteristically amateurish.More can be said, but after wasting a maddening hour and 45 minutes wading through this disaster, it would be twice as aggravating to invest more than five sentences urging this one be avoided at all costs."
4,Lee making some good stuff here!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Iz notz getz what all u all complaning aboutz. Lee makes a great movie alwyazs and this is included two. Theresa who looks fine plays a sex phone operator and findz herself stooping going for her drem aboutz actring. a paasionate film thazs about doing whatz su soppsue to do inz life. great movie in ever way....peace brother!
1,STUPID AND BORING,"I think this film showed how far Spike Lee has felled off as an great director after delivering such great films as Do The Right Thing, Malcom X, Mo Better Blues, School Daze.. some pretty good films in Get On The Bus, Crooklyn.. to the so-so Clockers.. This is absoutely his worst a very weak attempt at comedy that isnt funny at all.. The only good thing about this film is all the old Prince music .. Suggestion by the soundtrack and just avoid this at all cost."
4,Borrowing From Many Great Sources,"From 1969, this was Mott's best album, a level they never subsequently reached again. They combined the music of Bob Dylan, Procol Harum, the Who, and the Band in a dense, rocking sound covered by Ian Hunter's best Zimmy imitation. The borrowed material was all over the map, from the best cover version of the Kinks' 'You Really Got Me' to a soulful, dirge-like cover of Sonny Bono's 'Laugh at Me' to a psychedelic rendering of Sir Doug Sahm's 'Crossroads.' The band's own 'Rock and Roll Queen' is a classic that will get at least two parts of your body moving, and their 'Half Moon Bay' could easily have been additional cut on Procol Harum's 'Shine on Brightly.'They rocked and had a hard edge, but they forgot all the great influences on subsequent albums and slipped ingloriously into glam rock. A shame, because they definitely had the right idea."
3,not very good,"I wish i could say something better about this cd ,when i bought it i thought they reminded me of a forgotten band kings of the sun .That band just had a sound of it own and they could write .This cd did nothing for me the songs all sound the same the last song is the only good song on it .Yea it does remind you of acdc at time but it falls short of being a good cd.I dont recondem this one but if you like whiskey rock and roll whit a little drugs mess in you probally will like it ,as for me ill stick with kings of the sun and acdc.I hope this review was helpfull to you"
2,Frightening glimpse into others' lives,"Shute does an excellent job of portraying her two main characters, warts and all. Unfortunately it makes both of them unlikable and hard to sympathize with. The ease with which Vera's identity is stolen and her credit destroyed is terrifying, but it's also frightening to think that this book could be used as an instruction manual for any wannabe identity thief. Shute is terrific at writing out Vera's innermost thoughts, but she does so in a way that no one should ever be exposed, but perhaps that was her intention. The ending was disappointing to say the least. As the reader I wanted more anger from Vera. Perhaps the biggest flaw in the book is that Shute chose a poor character to be the protagonist."
3,Frightening that this could happen to you!,"When Vera de Sica pulls into the wrong parking lot at the car rental place, the car is stolen. This is only the beginninf of her troubles, since what the thieves really wanted was her identity. This is a fascinating look at how easy it is to have your identity stolen. Watching the thieves systematically run through Vera's money and credit is frightening. The book was good, though the ending seemed false to me."
2,Pretty Bad,"I think the book had a pretty good subject for a story but the writing isn't interesting at all. The writing is just boring and bland. It's not really much of a story. The book offers some identity theft ideas on creating fake id's, obtaining credit information, and using it. The author tells the story without moral conscience. At no time does the main character ever seems to feel any guilt about stealing. There's no sympathy showed for the identity theft victim. Also, the book never shows the possible punishment for identity theft. In alot of ways it's very morally irresponsible.I borrowed this book for free from the library. I wouldn't pay fot it."
1,because I can't give it 1/2 star (hey have to give author credit for writing),"I felt so bad about not liking this book when i began it that i felt compeled to finish it hoping for some grand ending. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. need i say more? Charlene was a believable character, in a stereo typical white trash sort of way. Vera reminded me of a boring timid little blah mouse, and her boyfriend had the personality of a toothbrush. (no wonder they were together) I love a good mystery, but there is nothing mysterious about the rating this book is getting! Watch a good Lifetime Movie instead"
5,Excellent golf shoe,"This is the second pair of G-Sok spikeless shoes I have purchased. Put them on at home, drive to the club, play 18, get back in the car and drive home. No worries about putting the golf shoes on at the course (always seem to get dirt on my pants from the bumper)...but the best part is that these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever played in! Furthermore, these shoes are waterproof and grip wet soil as well as any cleated shoe. Kudos to Etonic! Buy a pair and see."
4,Fishing versus Whale,"Careness needed, eyes wanted.More black, deeper melancholy.Stand like Lightening, carved like leaves.Fierce appoint, hard shave."
2,Claudio knows it full well...,"...that Anna Netrebko is not a coloratura soprano.This album is therefore 4/5 below par.The best part is the part that Abbadao suggested Netrebko to 'include' in this album - excerpts from Verdi's ""Otello"".Well, the booklet says that Netrebko took less than two weeks to master those pieces - this shows the lack of in depth understanding of those works by the recording producers, for even if those excerpts represent the best 'technically finished' product in this album, they are by no means the best recorded excerpts.Even so, Netrebko has a sound propensity for the lyrical repertoire, and by now, I would add the spinto repertoire, if she could eventually give up her self-consciousness and equally great, if not greater, propensity to go out of character in her singing.As for bel canto and coloratura, g'me a break!"
4,Wonderful Recital,"This follow up recital by Anna Netrebko is surely pleasent. Her lucious voice is just as beautiful on this CD as her recital debut, and her readings of old favorites are fresh and inspired. Maestro Abbado manages to present an ensemble of orchestra, chorus and singers that provide performances that deserve to be heard. One bothersome thing about Ms. Netrebko's voice that was not as noticeable on her first album is her lack of control of her lower register. In ""Sempre libera,"" her attempts at singing the lower notes of a coloratura passage sound like gaspy stabs. This is slightly worrisome, and one hopes that it is something that can be fixed to help her voice become a little more even throughout her entire range. Nevertheless, this recital and this artist are nothing short of thrilling. Her voice is unique as it is beautiful and her interpretations are as simple as they are inspired. Don't miss this beautiful treasure of an artist."
3,poor coloratura work,"I don't know why people are giving this CD 5 stars... I guess it's a matter of opinion. I agree with what other reviewers are saying: Netrebko is definately out of her repetoire here. She shouldn't be singing coloratura roles... she simply cannot do it well. Her 'Sempre Libera' was awful... weak, strained, forced high notes, bad passage work, and poor breath support... she even ran out of breath a few times. Her coloratura arias don't hold a candle to someone like Joan Sutherland's, who raised the bar very high. I listened to Netrebko and Sutherland's 'Mad Scene' from Lucia back to back, and sorry to say but Netrebko doesn't even come close to matching Sutherland's agility, pitch, strength, talent and artistry.A pretty voice, but she needs to know her strong and weak points... she should stick to lyric repetoire, and not try to 'show off' in coloratura roles. Overall, I agree with what another reviewere said: sloppy."
5,simple stunning,"having just found this young womans CD in our local speciality store I was transformed from the mundaine life to the peak of ecstasy with her wonderful voice and the intense colours created by her own intensity.Here is a woman who can fill the heart with words that are pure gold and like velvet on the mind ,a truly wonderful voice and a stunning person to go with it .Here at last is a worthy successor to Dame Joan and others who gave opera to the world ,now we have in Anna Netrebko someone to give the passion and drama of opera to a new audience with the fire and fun of the pleasure this style of music can give.It is great to at last have an opera singer of this caliber who is unafraid to be herself and to let her own warmth and passion come through LONG May she continue to be the standard for others to attain.May she never change her love of singing and life"
5,ULTIMATE OPERA PERFORMER,"AFTER INITIALLY SEEING HER ON TV , I PURCHASE 2 OF HER CD'S. I THEN PURCHASED TICKETS TO SEE HER LIVE AT THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE. ALL THE HYPE ABOUT HER IS TRUE ! THE ENTIRE HOUSE WAS TOTALLY CAPTIVATED BY THE VOICE,THE ENERGY AND THOSE DROP DEAD GORGEOUS LOOKS. SHE PERFORMS EVERY ROLE AND SINGS EVERY ARIA AS IF IT WAS MEANT FOR HER. SHE IS TRULY CAPTIVATING AND UNFORGETTABLE....WARHORSE41"
3,"Soaring voice, rushed and commercialized","The purest soprano since Maria Callas is being rushed and commercialized. An absolutely astounding voice has been taught no sense of orchestration or tempo. She is always overrunning here accompanyment, or being overrun by it.If she ever gets some proper training, she will be the greatest the world has ever known. She herself should begin by listening to the late great Slovak soprano Lucia Popova (a.k.a. ""Lucia Popp""). It is frightening to think of Nebrebko's voice with Popova's discipline."
2,Ok but not a bel canto singer,"Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe, and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart.Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note. The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything.Too bad; she could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M. Caballe, and of course Maria Callas..Listen to these and hear the difference."
3,Read it if you love Lizzie,"""The Golden Veil"" is a novelization of the life of Lizzie Siddal, the wife of painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Enthusiasts of Victorian history and the Pre-Raphaelite circle will enjoy catching the inaccuracies Paddy Kitchen's detailed (and often hilarliously overdramatized) story. Casual readers will only be annoyed by the melodramatic tale of an auburn-haired beauty doomed for failure in love and in life.Some passages are mildly entertaining (most notably the suicide scene) but a few good parts don't make up for all the shortcomings of this novel."
4,good but not his best,"Great album from a sales standpoint. But his best work by far is his 1978 Motown album Frontiers, which introduced us to the members of Switch.This album also contains his Quiet Storm classic ballad ""Castles of Sand"". His second best album was Let's Get Serious (co produced by Stevie Wonder) This album comes in third."
2,Missing Track,"I have this CD from the 80s. There is a track missing. My CD has 10 tracks and track 5 is ""When the Rain Begins to Fall"" as a duet with Pia Zadora. That is the best track on the album. Why is it missing?"
5,jermaine's best album,"This is without a doubt Jermaine Jackson's best album that he ever made and released. The only problem, at the time of release of this album, little brother Michael wouldn't allow the duet by them Tell Me I'm not dreaming (Too good to be true) released because Michael was on another record lable and Jermaine was on Arista records!! Sounds like little mikee wanted all the royalties to go to himself and nobody else!!!! Regardless of that incident, there many other hit singles on this album, including ""Dynamite"" ""Why Don't You Do What You Did"" and the duet w/Whitney Houston (prior to her demise w/Bobby Brown) ""Take good care of my heart."" If you like Jermaine Jackson, buy, download this album and add it to your collection. It's that good."
4,Jermaine Jackson - Not Bad,"I am not sorry I made this purchase. My favorite songs on this album are ""Do What You Do"" and ""Tell Me I'm Not Dreaming."""
5,A live stroll through 30 years of Magna Carta,"This concert was held to celebrate 30 years or touring and recording by Magna Carta. The songs cover all the inervening years and are linked by narative extracts from Seasons. There's a special guest appearance by Tom Hoye who was with the band during the 1970s.Sound quality is pretty good for a live album. All in all a very enjoyable album, but I must admit to being a little biased as I was somewhere there in the audiance for this recording."
2,Semi decent quality,The folder has good enough holding size but the buttons fall off pretty quickly. Good for organizing and storage but not for carrying with you.
1,item fell apart,My son said he opened one folder and the button just fell off and I paid $9.97 for three in a package
4,They'll Never Make A Zombie Out Of Me,"The Kinks play Dixieland?! ""I'm too terrified to walk out my front door.""The Kinks play country?! ""Take me back to those Black Hills that I ain't never seen.""The Kinks do social commentary. ""They're putting us in identical little boxes, no character just uniformity. They're trying to build a computerized community, but they'll never make a zombie out of me.""I've always loved the Kinks. My favorites are probably ""Tired of Waiting"" and ""Who'll Be The Next In Line"" which my band covered, and ""Jack The Idiot Dunce.""Muswell Hillbillies is my favorite Kinks album, the only one I still own."
5,"The Kinks' ""Let It Bleed.""","I am grateful to the friend who recommended this one to me because it's become a favorite. Ray Davies' lyrics are funny, scary, sad, and sometimes all of these at once. Displacement and loss of privacy resulting from urban renewal is one theme. Other songs lampoon fad diets, portray the melodrama of addiction, and whimsically celebrate English teatime. The musicianship is excellent, featuring judicious use of horns and keyboard and some of Dave Davies most incisive guitar work. Well-produced and arranged, the record's sound nevertheless remains raw and rootsy, reminiscent at times of The Rolling Stones' ""Let it Bleed."" This is especially evident in the greasy, prickly slide guitar on ""Holloway Jail."" Released in 1971, ""Muswell Hillbillies,"" like Stones' records of that same era, has country-blues and country-rock leanings, but with more specifically English content and style. It also features more head and heart and a little less crotch!"
5,excellent exercise is country rock by classic brit combo,"The Kinks had by the early 70s exhausted their fascination with all things British which had epitomized the albums ""Something Else"" ""The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society"" and ""Arthur"". This album is a drastic move away from that style as it embraces american themes and country flavour. While I would not call this a country album as such there is a distinctive rural american feel that touches on country, blues and folk along with good old rock and roll. This album stands as a distinctive statement for a band with a long and distinguished career. The album has a mood and a flow and feels very much like a piece rather than tracks just thrown together. An enjoyable listen from beginning to end."
4,Second Level Kink Greatness,"Can't really preach against the choir and say this is not a good album, but IMO it's in the second level of Kink greatness, after Something Else and Village Green Preservation Society, two of the greatest albums of the era. The music here is very fine, if unoriginal, but I think Ray's voice is too affected, as if this was a camp offering. The opening track is great, and Uncle Son is a favorite, but if you're not a Kink Completist, you might try one of their mid- to late- 60s albums to sample their very best work."
1,The Kinks become hillbillies? No thanks.,"This album is a severe letdown after ""Lola Vs. Powerman & The Money-go-round"", which found the band in excellent form, musically and lyrically. Here, Ray Davies has abandoned the rock sound in favor of twangy, strident music & lyrics. This was the beginning of the end of The Kinks as far as I'm concerned. I saw them many times in concert in the '70s, primarily to hear their Reprise/Pye material live. Seek those LPs out and leave the turgid, joyless RCA period to collect dust as it should."
4,"The Kinks album to buy, if you want to buy or try only one","If you are going to buy one album by The Kinks, make this the one. It's got their sound, the good songs, no filler. It's not overly-pop like ""One for the Road"" which, I think if you want to hear The Kinks, is not what you're looking for, and it's not full of filler like ""Greatest Hits.""My second Kinks choice would be ""Something Else by The Kinks."" The only way you'll do better than these is to have someone compile songs for the greats you miss here. Greatest hits has too many unnessecary songs and not enough ""great"" songs.If you want to listen to The Kinks, go with Muswell Hillbillies. It's better than you might anticipate - Good Music... Really Good Music. Meaningful and toe-tapping too. Deep *and* fun. An excellent band."
1,What was Ray thinking?,"I once listened to ""Muswell"" several years ago. Once. Other than the brilliant ""20th Century Man"" and ""People in Grey,"" this album is unlistenable. What was Ray thinking? I know the Kinks are marketing geniuses... but come on. They even out-do themselves on this one. Go with ""Arthur"" or ""Village Green"" instead."
5,The most perfect pop album ever written......period.,"What about a record in which every song is great...maybe even classic? What about a record in which the least song is better than anything most rockers ever even contemplated? For, example, the simple ""Skin and Bones"" is unforgettable. The Kinks have many records but this comes out of nowhere and establishes Ray Davies as one of the great pop song writers, perhaps the greatest pop song writer of all time. In a league with Cat Stevens, Neil Young and a small handfull of others. The last two songs are out takes. Good they are, but they should have been left off, because the original line up of songs is perfect...as my review title suggests."
2,CHECK YOUR STOCK NUMBERS FIRST!!!,"Sometimes the pictures on Amazon can be a little misleading. In this case the part number did not correspond with the picture shown. Before you buy anything, verify with the manufacturer's site that the part number listed is the one that fits. If you go by the picture, you might have to return it (like i did)."
1,wrong item in picture,"the item that was sent were the wrong item on the picture. The pic is of the 403 model, be carefull you purchase what you buying."
1,Disappointing,"It is to be expected that a memoir by a Palestinian girl should not give ""equal weight"" to both sides of the story.But I found it very disappointing that not only did Ms Kharmi not give equal weight to the other side but that she ignored the fact that the ""other side"" existed at all.It's as though she was able to see the British side of things but not the Israeli one.I hope she will keep writing--but that her next book will contain more introspection."
5,Palestine,"The untold story of the displacement and suffering of the Palestinian people. I am certain that few years from now, the world will once again say:IF WE ONLY KNEW!"
5,i loved the story,"i was walking in the library and looking at books and the cover caught my attention ,, i dont know whybut when i started reading the story ,, i absolutely loved itit talks about the struggle of a middle eastern girl living in the western worldit talks about the struggle of interfaith marriages .. how the love and romance suddenly disappear by the huge distance of geography and personal backgroundand the struggle of Palestinians ,, and the love of one's homethe feeling of belonging even after years and years of separating"
5,I love this machine!,"I haven't sewn since high school, and this machine makes it super easy. I love the automatic needle threader. Winding a bobbin and switching out thread takes just a minute or two. Super easy to thread the machine. Super easy to insert the bobbin. (I did have a problem with thread tension until I figured out I wasn't bringing the thread around the right way). Great stitch options. I've been thinking of new projects just so I can use it more! I will say I'm not a professional seamstress, so I can't account for the ""quality"" of the stitches. But they work great for what I need!"
1,Didn't like this machine,"I didn't like this machine at all and had to return it. The seams were never straight. The reverse button would never go straight back but always at an angle. The tension was never right. It kept giving me bubbling on the seams. I'm a very experienced sewer and I tried adjusting several things to make it work better but it never did.I would not reccomend this product to anyone. And to make matters even worse, it's been 2 weeks since I sent this product back to Jo-Anne's and I still have not gotten a refund or even an answer as to when I can get a refund.Poor product and service all around."
2,sewing machine,"Brother XL2610 Free-Arm Sewing Machine with 25 Built-In Stitches and 59 Stitch FunctionsOk machine, good for beginners"
4,Voltage in (UK),"I purchased this machine for my granddaughter who specifically wanted a PINK sewing machine. We could not source the same model in the (UK) so went ahead and purchased from Amazon (USA).(UK) purchasers beware, the voltage for all USA models is 110/120V and will not work properly in the (UK) without the correct foot pedal.Our machine arrived in the (UK) without any problem but then found out that we had to purchase a different foot pedal at an additional cost of approx 35."
5,awesome!,The brother sowing machine is the best you can buy in my opinion. The instructions are clear and easy to read so even a new comer to sowing can learn how to use it. The sowing machine is flawless and awesome.
5,Brother XL-2610,"I happened upon this at a local garage sale, and with my other machine currently broken, decided it wouldn't hurt to buy it and use it until my other was fixed. I'm so glad I did, because I love this machine! I make cloth diapers for a living, and this takes anything I can throw at it - elastic, 6-8 layers of fabric, attaching velcro, etc. I honestly cannot say enough good things about it!"
4,pleased,"Now, I know nothing about sewing. This is my first time with a sewing machine. I think the machine is responsive and basic. And it's got enough features and gizmos for when my skill improves. I found the directions to be vague and geared toward someone who already has a clue about sewing. However, I did find a you-tube demo. and my questions were soon clarified.The machine is rugged enough, but not overly heavy. I think the pink is cute and the size is perfect. The free-arm feature is already proving itself. I'm happy with the purchase."
5,Great!,"I bought this to get back into sewing. While the settings can be a bit intimidating, it's extremely easy to use and the manual is fairly thorough. I always test my stiching on a piece of fabric first so I can do the necessary ""tweeking."" Enjoy!"
4,Solid machine,"I have just started sewing, and I have taken a couple of classes to help me learn the basics. I wanted to purchase a machine that didn't cost a lot but provided some variation in stitch selection. So far, this Brother machine is holding up pretty well. I have sewn over ten projects with the machine, and materials have ranged from fleece to flannel to sateen. When you get to four+ layers of thicker fabric, the machine will kick up the noise, but it pushes right through without issue.I am happy with the purchase so far. I haven't had any issues with the tension that can't be adjusted easily; bobbin winding is a snap; and free arm design is great for cuffs. The directions in the manual are easy to follow for beginners. This isn't the product for a professional seamstress, but if you are looking for a fairly cheap sewing machine that will work very well for beginners or infrequent sewers, this is a good choice. Right now, I am loving this machine!"
3,Okay for beginners,"I bought this machine because it was inexpensive,...but I should have saved a bit more. Its a nice one for a beginner but it has a computerized internal chipboard as opposed to the real deal inside. So, it is a bit shaky when sewing and the bobbin has a tendency to bunch up. Overall I can do basics with it but will most likely be upgrading soon."
4,Great Value,This is a great machine for simple work. I bought this model instead of the one below it because of reviews here saying this machine is great for multiple layers of fabric. It's true! I was making a skirt that had 5 layers of fabric and this machine breezed right through. Totally awesome.
4,Not bad at all,I enjoyed this book. Loads of facts and alittle bit of humor. This is a must for anyone interested in Bible history. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because Dr. Gipp pushes his Baptist veiws when all I want is the truth. But I still see the book as a wonderful tool. Thats why I own two copies.
4,4.5 stars,"The product works well. It sealed a crevice around an old door quite adequately. It set up dry enough to touch in about 24 hours in the bitter cold. The squeeze roller thing helps you to get every drop out of the tube, so that was cool. The problem for me was that I needed about 25% more to complete the job...it wasn't a big job either. The point is that I think that the tube could be larger...is that enough to knock it a star? Um, I don't know. I recommend the product, but I recommend buying two tubes for any real, ordinary job."
3,Great Steam Engine Movie,"For all steam engine train buffs, this is the movie to get. The film features roundhouse, yardage, switching, and a great scene going into the Chicago railway yards in the 1930's. The main figure, Armstrong, is the same hero in the 1930's version of 'King Kong'."
5,If you love Trains,"I love the Milwaukee Road! And this all about Milwaukee Road Steam, with a plot thrown in, that will make ya cry!"
1,where is it??? Is this a legit company??,can't rate it cause still have not received it??????????? it should of been here 10 days Before Christmas?? I will have to try to contact the company?
3,An average 3 star graphic novel.,"Nothing special here. It did have it's moments, but overall it was an average to dull read. I only paid 5 bucks for this book, so at that price it was a good value. Pay any more and your certainly wasting your money."
2,Well...,"I'm not sure whether or not the recording is well done, but none the less I have problems with his performance style. Though his articulation is executed well, he has somewhat of a hollow tone to his playing, and the fact that he doesn't use vibrato much doesn't help him."
2,Not the Best...,"Although John Edward Kelly is a gifted saxophonist his tone sounds like its missing something, his minimum use of vibrato sounds as if he is an inexperienced saxophonist. In my mind nobody plays Ibert's Concertino de Camera like Marcel Mule(truly one of the most gifted saxophonist ever)"
4,Varied degrees of excellence,"John Edward Kelly is truly a unique saxophonist. While I don't like his tone that much, his decent technique and brilliant musicality shine through. His interpretations of the Ibert and Larsson are very good standards for these very popular pieces. The Martin, while not as popular as the other two, is still brilliantly presented and is worth a listen to. The only recording of the Ibert I would prefer over this is John Harle's, that's just my opinion. I would definitely recommend this cd especially at this price."
4,"Rossini - Le Comte Ory (Rossini Opera Festival, Pesaro 2003)","Rossini - Le Comte Ory (Rossini Opera Festival, Pesaro 2003) is a 2004 Deutsche Grammophon recording starring Juan Diego Florez in the main role of Le Comte Ory. Jesus Lopez-Cobos leads Orchestra Del Teatro Comunale Di Bologna in this a act comice opera. This is opera light and whilst not being a huge fan of this genre this is a delightful recording that I very much enjoyed listening to. The booklet contains all the lyrics, and well written music notes. Recommended. 4/5."
4,valuable tool,"I don't know how I got by without this nailer.now attaching rafterhangers is a snap not a thumb busting chore!Like all tools Grizzly sells, this one is worththe money."
2,leaks air,This Grizzly plam nailer leaked air with in the first hour of use. It makes the compressor come on even when the tool is not in use. It's not worth any more than they ask for it. (get what you pay for) I guess.
2,You get what you pay for,"I purchased this nailer because of the low price...thought I would give it a try and wouldn't be out much cash. It worked great for a total of 2 hours use. Then it started leaking air. I took it apart, cleaned, oiled and reassembled it...(this fix worked once before)...the second time however, same problem. I guess I'll get a more reliable brand next time. BTW...I was using it to drive in 6"" spikes in a fence line. The leather cover is a Joke...they should just leave it out of the box."
3,Great Value,I had bought this one instead of the bostich or portor cable b/c of price. I do not use it everyday but it feels like it would last even though it was so cheap. I have used the bostich before and I can't see much of a difference in the use or quality of the two products. Maybe if you needed it everyday I would think differently but I mainly use it for getting in tight places and joist hanger nails. To be totally honest even for joist hanger nails it is sometimes quicker the old fashion way. If you can get your hammer in the area. Then to put a nail in the nailer line it up and push. Handy tool for $20 + s/h I wouldn't have bought one of these nailers if it wasn't for Grizzly. Good going Grizzly way to keep tools affordable. BTW: it comes with a leather boot and has a magnetic tip.
4,Grizzly H6141 Air Palm Nailer,"I am continuing my review of this tool, promised to come back and add more about my opinion of this tool; so here it is; Grizzly Palm Nailer works perfectly great tool for the price. I'd like to give it 4 1/2 stars but unfortunately Amazon don't offer that option, would give it a 5 star rating but because of the leather cover/sheath tearing I can not give it that, sorry Grizzly! and that the fact that the coupler on the end where you attach your hose is aparently epoxied that gives it a much lower rating than it could of had. But guys if you want a good less expensive palm nailer than go for this one."
3,Grizzly Palm Nailer - Get what you pay for,"I received my grizzly palm nailer a few days ago and while it does everything it said it would, you can tell it's cheap. My first concern was that the magnetic nail holder was mounted on the side, not the hammer header like other devices. The concern here is that it makes it difficult to correctly align long nails. Next, when you press on the nailer to trigger the hammer, it takes a lot more pressure than I expected. Again, when using long nails this makes it unstable and you're more likely to wobble off of the nail than to actually fire the hammer. Perhaps with age the tool will bed in, but right now I'm a little disappointed. On the up side, however, palm nailers are a specialized tool and not used all that much day to day, so for $20 i can live with these foibles. Next time I'd pay a little extra and trade up."
2,It works,"All I can say is that it works and the price is low. I purchased this tool because I wanted to use it to drive landscape spikes, which my Grip-Rite nailer (which is MUCH smaller and lighter) can't handle (the Grip-Rite is limited to 16d nails).This tool is functional but very unrefined. And the leather handle is really flimsy.I would have returned this tool, but didn't because the cost and time I would spend on the return would exceed what I paid for the tool."
2,"Disappointed, Good for higher level Rangers","The book is well organized. Writing style is reader friendly. However, over 60% of books is of interest only to players running Rangers above 7th level. I bought the book because I knew nothing about Rangers, and wanted more information for running a beginning level character than found in the Player's Handbook, or the the Skills & Powers book."
4,Great use of page space,"This book provides a great look inside the persona of a Ranger. It's a great reference for Role-Playing and a handy guide for a few new proficiencies, skills, and items. In addition to being a great guide through the life of a ranger, this handbook also features some of my favorite art work."
4,Could have been a major comeback CD for the Four Tops...,"By the time The Four Tops joined Arista Records in 1988, they had not scored any major hit for a while. This album was their (purported) comeback CD--but it (sadly) just didn't happen. Granted, Levi Stubbs' lead vocals are as soulful and powerful as ever and most of the songs are superbly produced. ""Let's Jam"", ""Loco In Acapulco"" and the duet with Aretha Franklin (""If Ever A Love There Was"") are highlights but the entire CD is almost as good as anything The Four Tops recorded for Motown prior to 1972. Although Arista boss Clive Davis is credited as Executive Producer this album was poorly promoted and was not the big hit it deserved to be."
3,Unknown Mott,"Even most Mott the Hoople afficianados haven't heard this one. The high point is Sweet Angeline, which was a concert regular that Mott played for many years. A snarky, cynical rocker that has Ian Hunter comparing his girlfriend's mouth to a snake. Not sure that I get it, but it works. The lead song - Death May Be Your Santa Claus - gets kudos for the title alone. The rest of the songs are just so-so. All in all, not Mott's strongest work, but you can see glimpses of the genius that Ian Hunter would show on later work like All the Young Dudes."
4,Comes charging at you like a wild boar,"The snarling opening cut, ""Death May Be Your Santa Claus,"" stands beside ""The Chase,"" which leads off the first Family album, as two of my favorite beginnings to classic rock albums. And what a classic this one is. Mott the Hoople not only prefigured the punk sound but drew a line in the sand, daring their more timid contemporaries to follow along. Few did, and even Mott the Hoople mellowed considerably when paired with their soon-to-be mentor David Bowie. I would give this recording 5 stars for guts and glory but about a 3 for sound quality. The CD is unaccountably muddy sounding in places and Ian Hunter's vocals are sometimes buried so deep in the mix you have to just forget about them."
5,"The ""Real"" Military",A good movie with some definate insider knowledge of the way NCO's wish they could work!I never saw the old series but as an active duty Army Nco I did like this movie. Too bad the Army wouldn't help make it.Good movie!
2,Even Steve thinks this film sucks,"After doing this film Steve Martin quit doing movies for a while and even turned down scripts written for him so if your a huge fan you may enjoy it, but Roxanne, LA Story, and Bowfinger are some of Steve's best works."
3,Close -- But No Cigar,"I give credit to Steve Martin for trying to portray a Phil Silvers-like Ernie Bilko. Steve Martin came close -- but, no cigar. Also, Ernie Bilko (Phil Silvers) needed his support cast to be really funny. Unfortunately, the support cast in this movie remake of a great T.V. show just wasn't there.There were some laughs in this movie: Using mirrors to make a stock room look fill, moving boxes to make it look as if everything was on hand, and the daily ""Bilko"" lottery. However, there just weren't enough of these ""con-man gags."" At times the dialog became overly boring and trite.This isn't the greatest movie on earth. Frankly speaking, I have seen Steve Martin a lot funner. By the same token, this movie isn't all that bad, and it could be viewed to pass the time on a rainy/snowy afternoon. For this reason, I rate this movie three stars."
4,an ok movie,"Ok, so it isn't the greatest movie on earth. The dialouge is a little boring sometimes, and the characters could have been better. Still, an ok movie. At sometimes, I have to admit, Steve Martain had me laughing like crazy. And the drag scene is hilarious! Pretty good if you like Steve Martain comedies."
4,Steve Martin at his best!,"What can I say? I grew up watching a TV sitcom called, ""The Phil Silver Show""! I used to roll with laughter at his antics. No doubt about it, Steve Martin has out done Phil Silvers! Pay attention to the beginning and you have to be quick to catch on to what ALL is going on!It is one movie that I can look at over again and laugh at the same lines and scenes!It does not have any violence whatsoever, nor does it have vile language and sex. It does have a lot of gambling scenes since that is what the Sgt. and his platoon do all the day long! They have a racket going but it is one funny show! Buy it and put it on for some good belly laughs!"
2,"too long, too boring","This book has a ton of great information, but it is too long and too boring. It is more usefull as a reference book than a casual read."
2,better do you homework,"""The Crusades: A History"" by Jonathan Riley-Smith is a dull but thorough retelling of the crusades from their inception by Pope Urban II in 1095 to the very last crusading vows made in the early eighteenth century. His narrative is filled with names and places that speed by and unless one has some degree of familiarity with them before reading, they become a blur. Being a reader of historical narratives I expected more about the actual crusades than the events leading up to and surrounding them. I forced myself to keep reading just say I'd read it but there were only a handful of pages where I was able to give my full attention and interest. My suggestion: know some people and places before reading this. You will get no explanations as you go."
4,Real history,"Make no mistake, this may be ""a short history"", but it is, very definitely, a reference book, complete with huge quantities of names & dates. The bed-time reader with a love of military history (which is what I am) is likely to be disappointed. Whilst there definitely is a story, the time-scale is a little dis-jointed, but excusable, given the, length, range & diversity of the whole crusading movement. One follows the saga with some interest, but the short, almost dismissive, pen-picture treatment of some of the principle protagonists, I found annoying. Typical history book, I suppose. Mind you, this is quite a heavy-weight, short history, & while one may feel cheated & frustrated at not finding out more about the characters involved, one cannot help but marvel at the nature of man, to take on this series of momentous, magnificent but ultimately naive & useless actions, over the centuries."
2,"Better, bigger & cheaper alternatives","Price and scarcity are not usually useful measures of quality. If considering this title at the kinds of prices people are asking on Amazon you would be better searching for the readily available Howard Roberts three volume Guitar Compendium. The Guitar Compendium represents material honed by Howard Roberts over many early articles and several books. It is comprehensive and well written. For those who want to buy from Amazon, Mick Goodrick's Advancing Guitarist or Mark Levine's Jazz book are worth considering. The publisher of the Levine book is very considerate of the reader by providing it with a spiral binding as the book is very thick, so it lies open on the table making it easy to read."
1,Not all that great,"Although this product may appear to be very versatile, it can easily be broken if cutting branches or othe harder material. Comfort is something, but not everything/"
3,Not Too Bad,"I hate to damn Gloryline with faint praise, but it's a pleasant piece of jangle pop. If I lost mine, I'd buy another one (especially at these sub-dollar prices). But I'd buy ""Rough Night in Jericho"" first.There are a couple stand-out tracks on this CD that are pretty much worth the price of admission: ""Stand Tall"" was probably the ""hit"" off this one - I remember hearing it on local radio, but then I was in and around Athens at the time. It's a straight-forward piece of country-tinged rock, all chiming guitars and tambourines. ""Overton Park/Faith"" is a nice instrumental-cum-rock-out that appears on a lot of my mix-tapes from back in the day.Many of the songs have a soft Christian overtone to them, if that sort of thing matters to you. Other than the stand out tracks, not much else sticks in my memory, which may explain why there was no follow-up to this one. If you were wondering about Dreams So Real, go for Jericho. This one's an also-ran."
3,"Slightly weaker than ""Rough Night in Jericho""","Bigger production waters down the sound of Dreams So Real in their 1990 major label follow up to ""Rough Night In Jericho"".You can still hear the passion of the 1st album in tracks like ""Gloryline"", ""We Have Danced The Night Away"" and ""Here Comes The Train"", but the majority of these songs suffer from the increased production.Stick with ""Rough Night in Jericho"", and spend the rest of your energy looking for 1986's excellent ""Father's House"", with the outstanding track ""Everywhere Girl""."
2,Get the other ones first!,"Go start reading through the pile of glowing reviews for ""Rough Night In Jericho"" and you'll quickly realize that this was a really good band and was recognized as such. However, I think ""Gloryline"" was an attempt to move toward the mainstream and get more radio-friendly, quite possibly due to pressure from the major label who put it out. As a result, it was a failure musically, as well as commerically, and it was the last anyone ever heard from this band. Aside from a good, short instrumental piece, ""Gloryline"" was not memorable music, and a guest spot from Kate from the B-52s certainly did not help. (Going for another Shiny Happy People, I guess!) Do yourself a favor and check out Rough Night In Jericho, and, if you can find it, their debut album ""Father's House"" (only came out on vinyl, as far as I know) - those are the ones we want to remember Dreams So Real by."
3,Can You Say BORING!!!,"I bought this game when it frist came out! I played it for hour and got extremly bored! I ended up throughing my gameboy color when I got so sick of losing control. If you play this game under the age of 8, you will have problems! And after I played this game I wondered, do Mary-Kate and Ashley accually play their boring and stupid games, because if they did... they would be boerd out of their minds too! And if your the kind of person who likes hores's... this game is mostely about fashion!!"
3,"......Frustrating, Boring, Not Enough Horse Interaction","When I got this game for my birthday, I really liked it the first few times I played it. But it was 20$, and I beat it in six days. The codes were such a hassel for me, they got lost all the time, and I had so many codes I got them mixed up and wasted a bunch of paper. This game was a little challanging, I guess someone under 9 might have fun with this game. But for adults, older children, don't waste your money, and if you want a good horse game, it's racing mind you, but you should get Gallop Racer. One more thing, the makers of this game could've atleast made it possible to groom your horse!"
1,DUMB DUMB DUMB,"If you want a good horse game with care ( feeding,grooming,braiding manes and tails, and cleaning out poop ) get Horse illustrated Champion season. That game is millions of times better than that game."
4,WHERE IS THE REUNION SPECIAL? Uncut....PARTIALLY UNCUT,"I was looking forward to getting this season. BUTClaims to be UNCUT. ONLY PARTIALLY UNCUT. SOME language is uncut, some IS STILL CUT as aired on VH1 Other things uncutAlthough I enjoyed the season I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE REUNION SPECIAL WAS NOT INCLUDED.WHAT HAPPENED VH1?This is a BIG let down for me.A lot of other extras but NO REUNION SPECIAL"
4,Not as funny as season one...,"You already know about this. Flav is outta control and the chicks are dominantly bangin. I really do dislike ""New York"" though. However, she is funny as all get out. haha"
2,where's the reunion show?,"honestly, i am a big fan, loved the first season -- had high expectations about the second season -- IT IS MISSING THE REUNION SHOW!!!other than that i loved it"
2,Rotozaip Grout Removal Bit,"Bit wore out very fast I purchased two of the items and they did not last long enough for me to complete the job, which was removing grout from counter top. I had to finish the job using a grout saw"
4,Grout Bit Review,I agree with the other reviews that this bit wears out quickly. I am using mine with the Roto-Zip to remove mortar from mosiac tile that I am installing. I use a spray bottle full of water and keep spraying the surface. This keeps the blade cooler and lasting longer. This blade is best for detail work that isn't straight (ie. mosiac) If you are removing grout or mortar in between tiles I highly suggest using a Dremel Multi-MaxDremel 6300-01 120-Volt Multi-Max Oscillating Kitor comparable product. The grout bit on that works great. The bit (blade) does seem to last a long time. Just don't apply too much pressure.
1,Don't waste your money,"I attempted to use this bit to remove grout from a 2.5 x 3' shower stall with 3"" floor tiles.After 15 minutes, the bit was completely gone (ground away).I purchased another, and used it at a lower rpm.... bad mistake. Again, the bit ground away quickly.$ 30 later (2 bits)... only 50% of the shower was done. I had to finish it by hand.THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE ON THE MARKET. Don't waste your money."
1,POS,"I had a Jabra Dog tag bluetooth devive and love it until I lost it. I was looking for a replacment and came across the S705 Sound Pilot. It worked ""ok"" for th first few days but then it would not charge and power on. Needless to say I need to go back to the dog tag as this device will not work after such a short period of time. I do not recommend this at all."
4,Exellent BT Headset,I purchased this BT Stereo headset to connect to my Palm Pre Plus (as there is problems with plugging in standard headphones and loosing sound all together). I am using this device to steam music while I am at work. I can average about 10 to 12 hours straight with this device. I have read reviews that stated that the sound quality is not the greatest. I purchased a pair of SkullCandy Titan earbuds and I have NO complaints about the sound quality with a 192 Bitrate MP3. The menu's seem to be alittle bit laggy and the joystick can be easy to bump. All in all I would Highly Recommend this device to anyone looking for a BT Stereo Headset.
3,Not bad for the price but sound is iffy,"I wanted a blue-tooth device that would allow me to connect ANY pair of wired headphones I own. Sometimes I'm in the mood for ear buds, other times over-the-ear types.PROS:- you can use whatever 3mm headphones you want- long battery life- easy to see/use controls (back light is cool)- wear on belt...shirt...lanyard...whateverCONS:- they said 300' range...uh...NO. I didn't get any further away from my phone than my 30' headset- the sound isn't good. Not really sure what the deal is but the same song on my wired or blue tooth headset sounds WAY better. The sound when wired set is plugged in to the phone sounds worse when plugged into the device. There is a slight echo/static sound. Hard to describe but it does NOT sound as nice as being wired or using my Rocketfish headset.In summary, for the price...when mowing the yard...yeah they are fine. When sitting in the hammock I prefer my headphones."
3,Motorola S705,Having stereo for your telephone is nice. The ability to use your favorite earphones is wonderful. Music streaming is good but you have to keep the volume limited to avaoid distortion. As with most other bluetooth devices the sound of your voice on the other end of the line is lost. Microphone placement is the issue. In a moving vehicle it's only inteligible to the party you're talking to if you hold it right in front of your mouth. Hardly hands-free.
2,Wow. Missed it by _that_ much!,"Loved the A2DP, hated the microphone. They were sooooo close! Had microphone problems with one, and everything else worked great when connected to my LG VX8300, so I figured I'd exchange it for another. Even tested the voice command and made a call on the new one. Worked once, and I took it home. The next two times, the mic was so bad I couldn't do a call by voice command and the person on the other end couldn't understand me.I would have given 3 stars, since the MP3 player control was great, stereo sound was great, and the radio was a total bonus. But Motorola tech support was horrible. I emailed and the first thing they asked was ""when did you buy it?"" Lady, the product hasn't been out long enough to be out of warranty! And the second response was ""ship it back"". That's the best Moto can do with an early adopter? Geez, glad I didn't buy a Moto phone!I see the Sony/Ericsson pendant has gotten great reviews, maybe I'll try that one."
3,Virtuoso violin - Topic compilation from good vioiln players,"This is a topic compilation from violin players from the past. It contains some recordings from Kreisler, Grumiaux and so on. Very good for people who wants to get into this world."
3,No significant difference noted.,"These enzymes (and this brand) were recommended to me by the Whole30. I was having digestive issues with adding meat back into my diet, and these enzymes were supposed to help break it down and make digestion easier. After taking them for about a week with every meal, I didn't see any major difference, positive or negative. I've stopped taking them and wouldn't necessarily recommend them to others. Then again, maybe they'll work better for you?"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this product from Amazon based largely on the positive reviews. Unfortunately, this didn't do anything for me. My problem is with bloating and bacterial overgrowth. I had been getting pretty good results from GNC's Multi-Enzyme Formula, but decided to try the NOW product because it is more affordable. Sadly, my old bloating and discomfort have returned so I am going back to GNC."
3,back to brand products,This product works and is a cheaper alternative to other products and that certainly was my motivation when I bought it. I had better experiences when taking half the recommended dose as it occasionally upsets my system. There's no specific info given on the product of what's in it which I would not buy again.I was fearless trying out a product yet I am switching back to a more expensive and vegetarian enzyme product that leaves me with a better feeling altogether....
5,Digestive Enzymes,"Great product for a good price. Since having me gallbladder removed, I have been taking these to help my system with digestion. This product along with a probiotic does wonders. Heal the gut, heal the body!"
2,No benefit,I used this product for several months before my doctor (gastroenterologist) advised me that there is little if any benefit to be gained by using it.
3,~Unable to take product~,"Unfortunately due to my gastritis and sensitive stomach issue I was unable to take this product. There is an enzyme ingredient called ""protease"" that is not recommended for people with gastritis and sensitive stomachs. I order a product called Integrative Therapeutics Similase, 180-VCaps which I am hoping will help me. It is a lot more gentler on the system."
3,It is ok!,"I am not totally sure that it works! It was definitely better than other brands like ""Enzymedica-Digest Spectrum"" or ""Source Naturals Essential Enzymes""."
4,Capsules vs. Tablets,"I personally prefer the capsules, they seem easier to swallow. So if you are the type of person who has trouble with taking pills get the capsules. Helps keep your digestive system in balance and helps with the breakdown of fats and carbs, which is something everyone could use some help with."
1,Caused Incredible Heartburn,"The reviews for this product as a CURE for Heartburn and GERD were so enthusiastic across the web, that I really held out hope that this was ""IT"".I even ordered the item NEXT DAY DELIVERY.Took it at dinner with a medium sized pork chop , broccoli, and a few small potatoes. Within an hour my chest was on fire. The worse heartburn I had, had in months. Nothing relieved it. Not Tums, No-Reflux or Zantac. It only resolved itself the next day at about 3 pm.Be careful with any product containing HCI and Ox Bile if you have Acid Reflux. I wish it had worked."
1,Adverse reaction in mouth,"I am giving it 1 star because the upper part of my mouth is broken out and tip of tongue is sore.I did have it in my mouth longer than I should have, but still I wouldn't expect this product to cause what looks to be bacteria breaking out in my mouth.If it does this to my mouth what would it be doing to my stomach and other parts of the body.Because of this, I am not using this product any more."
1,fake,please do not buy this it is a fake just from the box you can see its only suppost to say era in capital letters dont buy this
4,"Huggable, if you're careful.","Pros: Adorable, series accurate, very worth the low price.Cons: Not very durable and re-attachments are highly likely to be needed.This Ed plush is very cute, and nicely series accurate. I've had him for a while now though, and as darling as he is he is not nearly as durable as plushes I've had from other lines (such as an 'L' plush from the Death Note line up). The shiny silver material used for his automail arm has begun flaking off and his boot straps and hair tie came off quite easily, I have managed for the most part to restore him with the liberal application of super-glue and since that he has held up much better! I wouldn't suggest giving him to a child or handling him very much without reinforcing the his glue, but I would suggest buying him if you're a fan, he's much cuter than his pictures and perfectly pocket-sized!"
5,Offensive and disgusting... I like it!,"A friend of mine recently showed me this comic, and my face actually hurt from all the laughing. The comics are not exactly politically correct, and do have a lot of jokes about crap and molestation, but hey- it works. I don't recommend this book to everyone, however, because the content is a bit extreme. If you're like me though, this'll be the comic you were always searching for and never found."
5,Unique Family,"I just learned that the patriarch of the family died; Mr. Zambelli will be missed but this writer has brought him, his work, his family to life. This is an extremely well written book, and beautiful colored pictures."
5,One of a Kind,"Exceptional writing, an interesting family, colorful photos, and recipes for every holiday make this book an excellent one. I bought a couple for Christmas gifts. I don't think anyone has explained fireworks and the people behind them as well as this book does."
5,EXCELLENT,My family and I loved this book. We thought it might be too technical but instead it was a joy and gave lots of good info on the fireworks business and a very interesting family.
5,Especially recommended reading for fireworks buffs,"Zambelli: The First Family Of Fireworks is the success story of one of America's most successful immigrant families and its flourishing business so closely associated with major American holidays and celebratory events. Tracing the Italian roots of the Zambelli family, as well as the prestige and beauty of their colorful displays during traditional and holiday celebrations, Zambelli: The First Family Of Fireworks is an engaging, informative, and entertaining success story which is especially recommended reading for fireworks buffs."
5,Careful - it blends!,"I just used my new blender for the first time, but having been used to using a blender with a very weak motor, I must have not put enough ice in the mix... because after 20 seconds of blending, the ice disappeared. Completely gone. I was left with nothing but liquid! So I poured out half my liquid and added more ice - and after 10 seconds of blending I got ""the perfect margarita."" I love my new blender! Now that I've got a handle on the power this thing has, I can't wait to make perfect margaritas (with plenty of ice) every time. The best part is that this blender has a very small footprint and fits easily in my cupboard assembled, taking up half the space of my old blender!"
4,Nice Blender,"This blender looks wonderful and holds a lot of liguid, easy to clean and very sturdy. I did notice that it sometimes has difficulty blending chunks of fruit and needs to be stirred a few times to get the right position to blend. And it's also a bit noisy when blending. But over all, I'm delighted to have it."
4,Almost the Greatest!,"I have NEVER had a blender that could make a great smoothie. Always chunks of frozen fruit, blocks of ice, but if I leave this easy to use off-on machine on long enough, it about gets it done. It a beautiful color, easy to clean, no leaking (yet) and hopefully the blade rotor on the underside will hold up -- I've had this part go on 100% of blenders. I'll know next year!"
3,Should have gone with my first impulse.,"I tried a Cuisinart blender at a friends house and was impressed by the way it absolutely destroyed ice in a frozen drink. Reveiws of this product on Amazon, however, disuaded me from buying it and instead persuaded me to buy the Hamilton Beach. It doesn't work as well and leaves small chunks of ice in the drink despite 30 seconds of ""blending"" and ""pulsing""."
5,"Well designed, easy to use","This blender is a dream. It is easy to use, with two speeds. (I never could tell the difference between Frappe and Whip anyway.) Its looks good with its designer lines. I got the red blender, and it is an accent piece in my kitchen. It is also well thought out in that its pitcher (glass) has a wide base, making it useful to serve from. Hamilton-Beach has done a great job with its Eclectrics line of appliances--they are well made, fun to use, come with a great warranty and all have great looks about them."
2,"Was below-average for a while, then jammed","I received this blender for x-mas last year. It has some nice design features (good heavy base to prevent tipping, measuring cup built into the cap). However, I experienced the same problems that others here have -- the blender doesn't do well with anything thick like milkshakes. It just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly, forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart. While it worked OK for a while, the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months."
1,Bad Blender,I have had this for a month and the rubber blades have sheared off. I am attempting to contact Hamilton Beach but they put you on hold forever and I don't have forever to wait!
1,! ~ Broke the 3rd time I used it ~ !,"I carefully researched prior to purchasing this blender. The reviews were favorable, overall, but i did see someone had reported breakage the first time s/he used it. i figured it was a fluke, as most reviews were positive. well, mine broke the 3rd time i used it. it broke at the base connector. one of the small 'fins'/pinwheels (not sure how else to describe) that connects the base to the thermos portion broke and what looked like small wafts of smoke came out. i only had soft fruits, soft veggies and almond milk in it, so it is unfathomable to me that this happened, much less so early on ~ ! ~ I've never returned anything to Amazon before and I want a refund, not a replacement, as I no longer trust this product. Hopefully Amazon will do the right thing ..."
4,The blender that's better than the bullet,I had a bullet and it worked like crap when it came to making smoothies.. Now since I purchased the Hamilton I can make smoothies like a mad man.. Oh and my wife loves it.. She now makes things like margaritas..etc... Love this unit.. I will say it only has two speeds and a pulse selection as well but my thought on that is how many speeds does a blender really need.
5,Great blender,"I use this thing a lot. Really nice, have had it for a over a year now and still no problems."
1,Very disappointed,"I have never paid this much for a blender, and it turns out I should have followed that logic again. This is the worst blender I have ever used. It sprays whatever I am blending all over the place every time I use it. The only way to keep it from doing this is to fill it only 1/4 full which completely defeats the purpose of having a blender with a large jar. It never crushes ice completely and the plastic piece on the top leaks even when it is screwed in as tightly as possible. I dread needing to use the blender for my recipes. The only positive aspect of this blender is that the base is sturdy."
5,I loved this book and I love the series!,"Thanks, Mr. Kritlow, for such a great series! I am really enjoying it. When's the next one coming out? For those possible readers out there, these are a delightful Christian, love story, comedy, mystery series - how's that for everything in 1(or should I say 3 so far?) - They are great!"
2,Very Disappointed,"Was very disappointed, very cheaply made, the face plate fell off when my husband opened the package. The lettering on the front is half off. Also the buttons are all out of whack...I wish that i had not purchased this mp3 player.Pay the extra and get an ipod!!!!!"
1,Whoo hoo: Chess HISTORY!!!,"Don't bother wasting your time and money on this book. It is not worth either if you're looking to get better. All this book has in it is information about Chess ""History"" (the forfathers of the game, etc.) and some ""basic"" endgame knowledge."
4,Good book for beginners/intermediate but not for advanced players,"This is definitely a good chess book.It contains 40 easy-to-digest lessons that always combine chess history with chess theory so you get entertained and learn something in each lesson, which makes studying the book fun.But IMO the book definitely should be most valuable for players between USCF ratings 1000-1750 instead of the proposed 1750-2050. Players with a 1750-2050 rating may be disappointed."
1,Boring and overrated,We are so fascinated by Soviet stuff when it comes to chess. Most Soviet chess people exhibit all the humanity of a dead fish. This book is no exception; it will dryly put you to sleep. It is overrated and not important. Save your money. There are so many good chess books. Check out the lists along the sides of these reviews. Those are the classics. You will not find this book on any of them.
5,Unual Music Great CD,"I have waited years for someone to perform the Uhl piece recorded here. It is a stunning piece, superbly played. The entire CD is outstanding and the Halcyon Trio is to be congratulated"
2,When professionals write books to promote their business,"I found this book to be of limited value. It seems to be written to pat the author's clients and contacts on the back, and to promote her business more than provide deep insight. Reading it felt more like a primer for ""want to be"" entreprenuers. It certainly didn't deliver on the promise of the subtitle ""inside secrets for growing a billion dollar business."" Really? This is how you build a billion dollar business? The repetitive references, and lack of depth strucj me as ""baby steps"" at best. Being an entreprenuer myself, and having chaired two dozen nonporfit organizations in my life, I've experienced or faced the founder syndrome numerous times, and couldn't relate to the broad observations provided here."
3,"Gaines begins with good pace, but story fizzles a bit . . .","Gaines created some great characters and the scene description really paints vivid imagery, but the story doesn't end with the climax that you'd expect from this type of story. Gaines methodically leads the reader and plants the idea of a big show down only to give away the ending in such a way that the last few chapters of the book sort of fizzle. However, due to the smooth story telling style that you'd expect from Gaines, you stay till the finish just enjoying the rythm and end up realizing that there will be no big climax long before the pages end.Gaines enjoys toying with race and the American class system while subtly preaching to the reader. Not his best Novel, but a good Saturday afternoon read."
4,It's outstanding to read and easy to read.,Everyone should read this eye catching and exiting book. Once you start to read you will not put back down.
5,Fascinating and True Trial of the Century in Rural Wisconsin,"This book first masterfully puts the events which transpired into their context in mid-19th century Wisconsin. It then sets out excerpts from the fascinating transcript of the murder trial of DuBay, a ""half-breed"" of high repute. The trial arose out of DuBay's killing of a Californian who moved into Wisconsin and took DuBay's land, with DuBay alleging self-defense. In addition to presenting a historical and colorful true factual story, the book is highly interesting for the insight it offers into the criminal justice system at this time."
5,Much better than the American Version,"Don't bother with the American version, this is the original, and done way better. The story line sits much better in it's proper cultural context, the American version leaves out a lot of stuff, and the character's motivations are way clearer in this version, the later version is really pretty unrewarding next to this. Worth paying attention to the subtitles to keep up with the story line."
5,Shall We Dance? Koji Yakusho.,"A must see movie, it is a better then the American version of Shall we Dance, this is the Orginal vershion."
4,An Excellent Movie! Why not the complete version?,"The original movie merits 5 stars. Unfortunately before it was released in the U.S. market about 18 minutes were cut. This is the same version that was released in theaters and, for most people that is enough. However, if you're a completist and have a region free DVD player I would recommend buying the Japanese version from Amazon Japan. Just click on Japan at the bottom of this page. The Japanese edition also has English subtitles for the movie but not the many extras."
5,A gentle Miracle of a movie! Enchanting!,"First of all, DO NOT PASS THIS MOVIE BY BECAUSE IT HAS SUBTITLES! If you do, you will miss one of the most wonderful films of recent years, or for that matter of any year. Shall We Dance is such a pleasure because it has a great story, marvelous performances and a terrific sense of humor...all the things which are so rare in most films. Although this movie takes place in Japan, the themes are so universal that anyone will identify with them and be taken in by the sweet story. The balance of humor & drama is absolutely perfect - I just love this film. The fact that it doesn't follow any of the cliches that you would expect is a breath of fresh air that I return to regularly. A joy from start to finish."
2,Shall we sit this dance out - I've two left feet.,"I had heard that this was really worthwhile DVD to see. I was disappointed. I felt that the acting was wooden & the film didn't move along - it had a tendency to get bogged down. Also the stars seemed to be self-conscious when dancing. I had seen ""Shall We Dance"" with Richard Gere & Jennifer Lopez before I saw the Japanese version & felt that it had big shoes to fill. I wasn't wrong. Richard Gere's ""Shall We Dance""? is streets ahead with an immensely watchable film."
4,Soundtrack has changed from the original,"For my college film series I ran ""Shall We Dance?"" DVD last night. Eight years ago I showed the VHS version. Both audiences love this movie.However, the soundtrack of the DVD version has changed from what I remember, and not for the better. About two-thirds of the way in they play the old Ben E. King song, ""Save the Last Dance for Me,"" and I thought, hey, that wasn't in the original. It's still a great movie, especially the wacky supporting characters, but the DVD soundtrack was a bit of a letdown for me. Not to mention that they need to do a remix of the voice track, as it was hard to pick up the dialog on a high grade theater system. But it's in Japanese with easy to read yellow subtitles, so no big deal--unless you speak Japanese!By the way, visit the Ebert and Roeper video archive of this movie. In it they review the 2004 Richard Gere version, not the Japanese original. Roeper (thumbs down) has it right; Ebert (thumbs up) has it wrong."
5,Hilarious and nonstop laughter,"I had been wanting to see this movie for several months because of my growing interest in Japanese culture. Every time I had talked with others about this movie, a smile crossed their faces, and even as I am writing this review thinking about the movie, one spreads across mine. This movie is hliarious and heart touching. The story is good, the acting is superb (esp the character of Aoki), and the mood is wonderful. I recommend this to anyone who wants to be swept of their feet with laughter and love. A definite good buy!"
5,"Wonderful, incomparable, a gem!","Absolutely one of the best films I ever watched! The entire cast works so well together--wonderful chemistry. Their convincing portrayals leave you so immersed in the story, you forget about time and subtitles. The sub-plots build nicely into the main story, and the film leaves nothing undeveloped or unfinished. You find yourself in empathy with all of the characters--you want to cheer all of them, blush with embarassment for Sugiyama, tear up when Toyoko degrades Tanaka, bask in Tamako-sensei's glowing warmth, edge in on Mai's cool reserve, take on the world with panache with Aoki--wow, what a ride! I would not change a thing about this film. Enjoyable through and through!"
5,Rediscover the passion for living,"Shall We Dance? reminds us that life is not meant to be routine, but instead a journey of passions. What you get in this film is a delicate view of personal discovery that will leave you not only wanting to enroll in a ballroom dance class, but also desiring to reach out and make new acquaintances."
4,And I don't even like foreign films...,"My daughter and I rented this *by accident* at the video store. We meant to get another dance flick and got disctracted. When we got it home and saw what it was, we almost didn't bother to watch it, but agreed, ""what the heck...it's paid for.""And wow, were we surprised. This movie is so stinkin' funny. The characters are hilarious, but believable. The dance scenes are a joy to watch, too. (And I don't even like dancing!)I've always had a big mental block when it comes to foreign flicks, but this one is a real treasure.My daughter still can't talk about this flick without breaking into a serious case of the giggles."
5,Dancin' DAncin' DANCIN'!,"A sheer joy to watch! Wonderful and heartwarming. The cast was an incredible ensemble.Delightful! I could watch it over and over again! RENT IT, BUY IT, SEE IT!"
3,Shall We Dance-Foreign version,I bought this movie because I really like the US version of the movie. This one is not as dramatic and heart-warming. I liked the dancing part because I love to see people dance the classical dances.
5,Hysterically funny with wonderful clean humors(for a change),My husband and I saw this movie twice already. Once in the theater and once at home. We can't wait to own it. The director did a wonderful job presenting the true view of a boring japanese way of life and hilarious ways that the japanese try to find excitements in such environments. I think we can even relate to most of the movie in our american lifestyle. It is a very good clean comedy.
1,This is the short version of this film!,"I have ordered this movie twice and had to return it twice because they sent me the 119 minute version both times. Amazon assured me they would remove the current product description, but they haven't yet, so be warned you won't recieve the 136 minute version."
5,Feeling light in the loafers?,"I watched this movie by mistake. Someone had put the Shall We Dance DVD into a Gladiator case. I'm glad they did.It took all of two seconds to love this movie, about an uptight Japanese account who spots a pretty woe-be-gooten girl in a dance stuido window.The movie follows our Japanese account as we see him, having an internal struggle, with one hand on the door of the dance studio and one foot on the sidewalk ready to bolt.This movie seems to be the Japanese answer to Strictly Ballroom. And a great answer it is. Unlike Strictly Ballroom that awes you with the tough dance routines, Shall We Dance makes you feel as though YOU could do the routines!"
4,Shall We Dance?,This is an awesome movie. i recieved the movie within the time limit and it came in excellent condition. i enjoyed it very much.
4,The World says 4!,Well the movie I think is great. Better than the new one with Richard Gere. Though there was just one problem with the dvd it takes a chunk out of your wallet. The movie itself is 5 stars it's just that $30 dollars for 1 dvd is just a bit too much
4,A amzing subtidled movie,That was only the third subtitled movie that I saw and it was grate. I really like subtidled movies and that one also had a lot of heart and soul plus pizzaz and I highly recommend people to rent or buy this vedeo and its PG so pretty much anyone can watch it.
5,Finally!,"Everyone else has written a great review on this movie, so I just want to say that I've been lying in wait for a long, long time for the original to release on DVD here. So in a way I'm glad for the remake of Shall We Dance (which I couldn't bring myself to see), because otherwise we might have never gotten the US DVD release of the Japanese original."
3,"Kiara Are ""The Perfect Ones""","This Detroit Duo, Kiara (not to be confused with the Latin Continuum group), debuted with To Change And/Or Make a Difference on Arista in the late-'80s. They returned in 1990 with Civilized Rogue, but the duo's sophmore effort never expanded the success vocalist Gregory Charley and guitar/keyboardist/drummer John Winston enjoyed with their debut. Civilized Rogue peaked at No. 53 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, while the first (""You're Right About""), second (""Every Little Thing""), and third (""Mr. Dee Jay"") released singles successfully charted on the R&B charts; ""Every Little Thing"" struck the top-10. Rogue doesn't lack both standout ballads and uptempo dance or new jack tunes, but for some reason, it had the effect of bringing them back down to the pack (Mac Band, Main Attraction, Riff, ect.) and losing whatever momentum they'd earned from their winning debut in '89."
3,"Overpriced, Chintzy.",I bought this for stripping wire and general cutting. I own lots of Klein tools and chose this based on their quality. The knife is not horrible but it feels cheap. The blade is thin and the handle and locking mechanism are lousy. This knife is not worth more than $10. I will give it away when I get a better knife.
5,Doubles as a garden-defense weapon!,"Bought as a gift for my mom to use in the garden. Seems like it'd be good for cutting roots and hard soil. The tool looks like a love child between a combat knife and a spade.In any event, my mom got to replace the old steak knife she kept with her gardening tools."
2,they sent me the wrong tool,"I ordered the carbon fiber hori hori and they sent the stainless steel model. I didn't want to bother with returning it, but still pretty frustrating"
1,Not happy!,"Tool came with three rust spots. I take care of my tools and would never allow rust to take hold of any of them! I can't believe that I had to pay for a ""new"" tool that came with rust does not make me happy!"
3,Hori Hori Knife,"Item was a Christmas gift for my husband. Since it's winter and he's really not going to be able to start using it until the Spring, we really don't have anything to share about it. I purchased it soley on the reviews I read about the product from others who have purchased it."
5,Super gardening tool,"This well built multipurpose gardening tool eliminates carrying many other tools around. Digs, cuts, saws, scoops, the perfect tool to carry around the yard and garden. Well constructed. A+"
4,A big hit with my 2 year old,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter. She loves it. Its a little hard talking on the mic but enough for my daughter to hear herself and not be heard around in other rooms. The only thing I would change on this product is making microphone cord a little longer. Otherwise, its a great gift."
3,Backyardigans Sing-Along Music Maker,This thing is soooo annoying! Why is there no volume control?!?! It's just loud and LOUD... seriously! I love the backyardigans but really? It even hurts my son's ears-- does it really need to be this loud? It's not like the kids can go very far from it with the tiny little cord that's attached to the microphone! It's not a very well thought out toy (sad to say) had hoped it would be a favorite... but we just keep it turned off ALL THE TIME
2,I'm Going Deaf!!!!,"My son, 21 months, loves it. Personally, I'm going deaf. There is only one volume setting and I feel like I'm stuck sitting next to a massive speaker at a rock concert. This gift was opened 30 minutes ago and I'm ready to hide it. The decibels are brutal."
5,LOVE THE TOY....but $150?? Is this a joke??,"This is a great to, for sure - both of my kids LOVE it - but for this to be listed for $150 as ANYTHING but a typo is ludacris. Many are saying it's ""hard to fine"" - Take it from me - check out seasonal consignment sales - it's just another toy kids outgrow and we actually got ours in PERFECT condition for $5!"
4,Kid pleaser!,"I agree, it is loud and you hear the same songs over and over but isn't that every kids' toy? My only complaint is that it should have more songs. Otherwise, it seems to be very enjoyable to toddlers."
4,Your child will love it but you might not.,"Our 18-month-old daughter LOVED this toy. My only complaint is the lack of volume control. It's VERY loud and you can't adjust the volume in any way. When it comes to your child, though, they'll love the toy. I'd say it will make a great toy for any child with a patient (ad somewhat hard-of-hearing) adult. =)Like someone else said, the cord could be a bit longer for the child to use it better, but I'm sure that it's short for safety issues."
3,Too loud and mike cord too short!,"Those are my two biggest complaints, no volume control, and the mike cord is way too short, so if my almost 3yr old daughter want to move around at all, the main component flops all over...Yeah, the songs are repetive and annoying, but who of us with a toddler in the house hasn't endured the same Blues clues or Dora DVD over and over and over just for a little peace, lol. I wish the cord for the mike were just a bit longer, my daughter wants to move around a bit while singing along, and she really cant...so after playing with this on and off for a week, she's pretty much abandoned it and its in the consignment sale pile to be sold soon."
1,ANNOYING!!,"This is my first review of any item I have ever purchased. I thought for this price I better warn others. My 17 month old son loves the Backyardigans and so do I but this toy is a waste of money. Loud like the other reviewer commented, and heavy so all my son does is drag it along the hardwood floors. Take an aspirin or hide it!!"
5,Award Winner!,"""Macromedia Flash MX: The Complete Reference"" was awarded the Referenceware Excellence Award 2003 for the best book in the Graphic Design and Multimedia category at the Waterside Publishing Conference held in Berkeley, CA on April 10, 2003. This award is based on actual readership, so it is an excellent indicator of the high quality of this title. You won't find a better choice of Flash MX titles."
2,Where's the New Stuff?,"I have not received Flash MX yet. But I read about it. So I went to the bookstore yesterday looking for a reference manual and picked up this one. I was eager to see the descriptions for embedding video, the new testing capabilities (drag and drop, matching, etc.) But I couldn't find anything.Perhaps I missed something. But the book seemed more like a Flash 5.5 manual than an MX manual."
1,Flash 5 or MX?,"I'm sorry for the author, but i see not much about Flash MX in this book and a lot about Flash 5. Just a fiew pages about components and a superficial tractation on actionscript. The rest of the book is a good book about Flash animation, but not suitable to learn applications development in Flash(that is supposed to be one of the Flash MX main goals)."
1,The worst I've seen in a long time,"This has no examples of Action Script that are useful. I continually pick it up and give it another chance, but time and time again I find frustration. I am very dissapointed in this book. As a flash author, I need more examples of script and less simple definitions of what things are. Much better books are available from the publisher ""Friends of Ed""."
4,Super Furry Album!,"This album is great. I had never heard these guys before, but this cd is a great way to get to know them. I think it is better than ""Guerilla"", and the songs are all catchier. Best song? The International Language of Screaming(followed by a close second of She's Got Spies)"
5,Rock On!,"SFA rules!I bought this cd without ever hearing the music, my only source to go on ""Bad Behaviour"" from the Twintown soundtrack. This album has loads of great songs (Tracks 1 through 10). The best are #10(sung in welsh!) and ""Play It Cool"". BY the way, ""She's Got Spies"" is one of the most interesting love songs I've ever heard. Let's hope to see more SFA in the future."
4,Radiator,"Radiator being Super Furry Animals 2nd studio album and their 1997 was hit among both the critics (Allmusic gave it 4/5 and Pitchfork 8.6/10) and it peaked at #8 in the UK charts. 4 singles were released from this album, i.e., ""Hermann 's Pauline"", ""The International Language of Screaming"", ""Play it Cool"" and ""Demons"". Super Furry Animals can be defined as being a mixed between psychadelic rock and electronic music. All the lyrics are included but we do not get a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5."
5,herb pharm,I think herb pharm products are great the connective tissue is wonderful thank you i been using their products for years
1,Another wacko conspiracy fairy tale,"This book follows the usual conspiracy nut formula. Ignore all the proven evidence that points squarely to James Earl Ray as the assassin, and dream up alternate stories for everything. This is rubbish, start to finish. Just do some basic internet research and learn the truth. There's a good reason that people have never heard of this book, because it's fiction of the worst kind."
5,Bringing back the spirit of Christmas,"I recently read that there are really two Christmas holidays: the federally-recognized secular ""day off"", and the true holy day. Quite true. If you seek to return to the latter, look no farther than this collection of music that harkens back to when Christians really understood the significance of the day. The angelic voices of Anonymous 4 will quickly become a seasonal favorite."
3,Compilation,This 4-CD set is simply a compilation of previously published volumes.This was not disclosed in the product description.If you already have On Yoolis Night or other Christmas volumes you do not need this set.
4,True Philly Hip Hop,"This takes me back to when hip hop was fun. Hearing these cuts, especially dividends & greatest man alive brings it all back. This may not ever be considered a classic, but the album and the group are among the most under rated in all of rap music. Find this, buy this, then play this!"
4,I miss 1988,yeah this was a good lp greatest man alive by est on vocvals was tight funky divedends was my favorite with that delagatiobn sample man miss those old school rhymes and scratches.
2,Terrible,"This game is the worst in its genre. After the 2nd quake, which was also bad, came something even worse quake 3 arena. After playing the pc, then renting the game for ps2 i realized that both were bad. Terrible controls, you can't win on normal diffuculty since the guys kill you easily, and the arenas are small and are terrible-looking graphics. Don't buy this game, it is a waste of time and money!"
4,Quake 3 Still King,"Quake 3 was definatly one of the greatest FPS on the PC, the PS2 version is no exception. Despite long load times and a slight lack of variety, the game plays like a dream. The graphics are better than any I've seen on the PS2 so far, and the action never skips a beat. I've read the game even runs slightly over 60 frams per second and never below. Buy this one as soon as you see it!"
1,Buy this game for your PC,"I've spent hours playing Quake 3 on my PC. These hours add up to days, months even. I play online. I play in tournaments online. I can't get enough. The PS2 version is a mere shadow of the PC version. Graphics are muddy (even with an S-Video connection), control is awful. I could write paragraphs expounding on the awfulness of the control. This game is designed for use with a keyboard and mouse. Some first person shooters can pull off the use of a controller (Southpark for N64 works wonderfully). If you've never played Quake 3 and you like first person shooters, buy it for PC (it almosts warrants buying the PC). Anyone who likes this game even a little for PC should not consider renting this game - in fact, avoid even looking in its general direction,I admit to playing only multiplayer (with two others). I did not try the story mode. I did not want to.Run away from this version. Better yet, destroy it as soon as you see it."
3,Nice try ID,"Stick to pc's. It was a nice try, but this game just fell short, way short. The level graphics themselves and the guns' appearences were pretty good, but the shots hitting the walls and or people looked like something out of the original Duke Nukem. Gameplay was a bit too fast for my liking, and the game was but a shadow of it's original self. I was used to the guy w/ the railgun running maps, but now, w/ the difficult controls and speed, it's the guy who can pump the most lead into a room. This game was just short. I liked fighting that annoying guy who says ""excellent"" during the game, and the level/gun graphics brought it up a little. Don't bother renting it, just stick w/ the pc version."
4,Quake III Revolution for PS2,"This game is excellent if u like games like doom and timesplitters. I find this game slightly better than timesplitters, but it is very slow. The controls are very easy, but aiming up and down can be a pain if you are in that kind of situation. I guess i gave it four stars because it is the best game of its kind by far,for its slow speed i took one off. I can probably finish 2 eggs and orange juice while it is loading the level. I love the gameplay because they actually went a little past a few drops of blood spilling out, unlike most games. Don't buy this game unless you have friends to play multiplayer with, because it can get boring playing the same thing over and over just to beat the vadrigar. THAT'S ALL !!happy gaming!!"
1,Playstation butchers another one!,"Ok lets be honest, Playstation has already bought out Dreamcast in their babyish attempt to get rid of competition. You're going to see Sonic the Hedgehog on PS2 soon. But one thing that itches me is that they butchered Quake 3. Its a mere shadow of its former self now that PS2 got its grubby and greedy little hands on it. The graphics are one thing thats merely good. Dreamcast version was BETTER, because it had more availabilities. Now that the moneyhogs at Sony got their wish of getting rid of competition (the Dreamcast whooped it big time), you will begin to see Sega-based titles appear on the PS2. Maybe we'll see Mario on the Playstation 2 in a few years. Who knows."
4,i need more...,"If you've played all the Quake you can get your hands on, including the mission packs, this is the only place left really. I've done half life, unreal and red faction in an attempt to dim my quake urges but nothing worked except Quake 3! All I can say is I NEED MORE QUAKE!"
3,OK but a lttle off,This game is fun to play when you have some friends over. However it takes five to ten minutes to load and it loads after every screen. The gameplay is fun but there aren't alot of weapons and you run out of ammo pretty quick. The characters look pretty 2D. If your looking for a shootem up game go with Unreal.
5,five stars,"Manifestly this is a popular CD amongst Milwaukeeans, Wisconsin people, and Midwestern regionalists amongst others; the reasons why there was not a sequel et cetera is a complex question and maybe owes something to Reaganomics? Or maybe not. In any case, it is a CD I often throw on when I sit down at the typewriter or computer or drive down the motorway and is the only ""Top 40""-type competition I am aware of for Schubert, Strauss, and similar fare for this purpose."
2,Old product,I have bought this product several times from other vendors and it was good. This one from nutricity turned out to have a weird smell and it is darker in color. I think it's just an old product. I also notice now they have lowered their price to less than half of what I payed for it. The price drop may have something to do with the state of the product. Just wanted to let people know that there is a possibility that the product they receive is in the same state as the one I received.
4,Deceivingly simple,"The Twistii is a deceivingly simple apparatus that makes it possible to create your own updo style. When I received the Twistii, I was a bit surprised. It is amazingly simple, consisting of only 3 parts. A piece of flexible, clear plastic, and elastic band and a clear plastic stick.The instructions came with it and were short and easy to understand.After a little practice and with some preparation, such as curling with hot rollers and spraying the hair with hairspray, the Twistii is very successful for creating a quick and easy updo style."
3,Only covers beat patterns,"If you want to know every beat pattern, this is the book for you. I was looking for a more in-depth look at cueing, cut-offs, how to use both hands. I found it slightly helpful but covered very very little. I read the entire book in 9 minutes."
2,Down Beat Up Beat and not much else,"I bought this book because it was written by same author who wrote ""Beyond the Downbeat."" I thought DB/ UB was sort of prerequisite to BTD. It was not. I would not say it was money well spent."
1,Fake Reviews,"Obviously the other 3 reviews are from the same person and he works for the store that sells the DVDs, this is not an honorable thing to do because it only confuse the buyer."
2,Get what you pay for.,"Like most Dj's, I am always trying to find the best products for the best price. I saw this NADY for $149.00 and read a little about it and pulled the trigger knowing NADY was one of the first in the wireless biz. I got this in yesterday, hooked it up and thought it was ""acceptable"" considering what I paid for it. I got some buzzing when the signal get weak (What is Squelch for anyway?) mic tonal quality not great. I used it while setting up for a wedding and I turned the transmitter off and POW! Huge POP! Oh! according to the manual I am supposed to ""mute"" the mic before turning it off! WHATEVER! Good Luck! The power switch AND mute are right next to each other.I returned this thing and got an Audio Technica I don't have to worry about. I didn't want the Shure PGX because I want to ""pick"" my frequencies.If you have a great mic, you only have to worry about your announcements. If you have crap...it will reflect on you and your business."
2,mini cooper sure is mini,Would have helped if there was a measurement description. Way smaller than what I exepcted. Won't get fooled again.
3,Wrong Product,"I'm sure this works for the proper skin condition, but it certainly did not help mine, it made it worse. I broke out in a huge rash over my entire back and it took weeks to heal. I'm not sure what is in this cream, but it did not agree with my skin."
5,Awesome Service,Got the product in just a couple of days. Also enjoyed the free things that were put in the package!
4,"author, in prose and poetry, urges consciousness shift","Author Dismukes recounts her recent recovery from alcoholism as paradym for African-American led needed change in American consciousness, which she finds both an ongoing process, and a desirable end.The poetry is moving, some of the essays poignant, and the African graphics all provide a terse and thought provoking introduction to current 'Afrocentric' thought. Whether discussion of SM in a chapter on sex adds to, or detracts from, the author's otherwise spiritual approach cannot be determined by this reviewer who has no special knowledge of this particular sexual practice.Except for this sidetrip into current fad sex, the book is a strong contribution to the recovery literature from the African-American view, with prose and poetry mix an African-American tradition."
4,We love it!,"I was concerned the stroller would not be large enough for my 6 month old pug and seven month old chihuahua, but they both fit in there comfortably, with room to move around. I received it very quickly and found it was not difficult to assemble, except that the screws mentioned in the directions, were not there. Thankfully, my husband has any kind of tool, nuts, bolts and screws a person could need, but this could be a big set back for someone else. Thus, the four stars. Expecting to have to pay at least $100 for a stroller, this choice was perfect and seems to be well made. I am happy with this purchase."
2,This may not work for cats,"I ordered this but found I could not use it for my cats and ended up giving it to a friend for her two dogs. The problem is that there are gaps between the top and the bottom of the stroller that makes it very easy for kitty to get his head out of. Once a cat gets their head out, the rest of the body follows. It was my intent to use this to walk my cat outside but with other animals and cars I can't take a chance with any gaps where kitty could wiggle out. The wheels are great, the material seems good, it all seems well made but it's a dog stroller not a cat stroller."
5,Just for the spoiled,"Wow, finally was able to take our two spoiled cats, ""zoi"" and ""tigger"" out on their maiden stroller ride. Did I ever get the looks. ""That woman lost her mind.?"" was the thougt I was getting. And besides this, I talking to my cats along the ride/walk. You wanted my review, here it is."
4,Happy Cat,"Very Happy with the stroller. Our cat loves the extra time outdoors as a result of having it.My only negative is to Amazon or their warehouse charging me 40% of the stroller cost for shipping & handling. I did not find it cheaper anywhere else, however, but would have spent the same money elsewhere if the shipping costs were in line."
4,A Daily Devotional,"This is an abridged edition of Butler's four-volume set that sits on our shelves. This volume list one saint for each day of the year. The editor uses the day of their death, which has been restored as the principal occasion for liturgical observance of a saint's life, work, and virtue. The work has also been updated to list those blesseds who have been become saints as of 1956. The reduced number of biographies of the saints in this book has a slight bias to Anglo Saxon saints and the two wholly new saints are from the United States. The editor has also updated the entries and modified the language to modern English, He has also deleted pious exhortations allowing the saints achievements and eccentricities speak for themselves. Though a handy modern catholic beside book, it is no substitute for the original four-volume set."
2,religious,A starting point in studying the lives of the saints but lacks a lot of depth that the full set has.
4,Clear and Concise,"As a ""daily devotional"" this book is clear, concise and very informative. Following the lives of the lesser-known saints is every bit as revealing as reading about the major ones."
3,Butler's Lives of the Saints,"The rating of 3 stars does not reflect THE BOOK - actually, I have another copy of this book and love it. However, I ordered (I THOUGHT) A LARGE PRINT EDITION. Your presentation on line was very confusing. I requested large print offerings, and, found that not everything that came up for perusal was large print. I made the mistake of selecting what I thought WAS large print only to find, upon receipt, that it was not. I was purchasing this book as a gift for my neighbor who desired a book about the lives of the saints in large print because he is legally blind and cannot read the normal type. For that reason I rated my experience as a 3 because I am disappointed. I AM STILL LOOKING FOR A BOOK ABOUT SAINTS IN LARGE PRINT AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE ME. R. Ford"
2,CD rom available.,I understand there is a CD rom available which contains four volumes. Has anyone used this?
4,Exactly as I expected...,"Lots of reviewers complained that the sound & picture quality were below average. Since most of these serials from the 40's were all but forgotten by their studios, the copy I got (really cheap) by Pacific Entertainment, was adequate enough to enjoy the silliness of the whole thing. The sound and picture quality on this DVD is adequate; I heard and saw all that was necessary to enjoy this sweet piece of nostalgia. I wasn't expecting Criterion quality, or Lawrence of Arabia production values. I was entertained, and that's what it's all about."
5,A wonderful CD for guitar lovers,"Dreams of youth : this CD is a marvelous tool for playing my guitarThank you Mary, thank you Les... Idid'nt know you enough before I bought this CD.Nice to ear you ""agaiiiiiiin""(as Mary used to say !"
5,A FAR GREATER LOSS TO MUSIC THAN MICHAEL JACKSON,"Today we lost one of the fathers of rock & roll. The man that gave us the solid body electric guitar, multi-track recording and arguably the most iconic musical instrument of all time, the Gibson Les Paul model.The man was a true innovator and an artist. He will be missed."
5,LesPaul,Bought this for my Mom who digs this type of music. She's 82. She said she waited til my father went out and cranked up the CD and sang along with it-etc. She said it's a good recording and has most of the best songs that she likes. Guess it's a good thing-
5,Totally Awsome Remastered Sound!,"How we yearn for the bands and sounds of the 1950's. Good old Days? Hey, I am only 44 years old. This sound is before I was born. Compare to today's music, I will get lost in the 1950's anytime! Thanks Guys! Thanks Les! JimmyMac Clifton Heights Pa."
4,A delightful ride,"This trip through Les Paul and Mary Ford's recordings is so delightful that every time I listen to it, I wish it were longer. I find myself singing along every time.The long excerpt from the 1950 Les Paul radio show at the end of the disc is interesting and fun, but all known episodes from the short-lived show are available and easy to find on the Internet."
5,Classy Classic,"I actually tried to find the original full recordings but the only thing I could find was on e-bay and it was over $100.00 for cassettes! My mom, who is 80 and had been bed-ridden remembered years ago and wished she had bought the set at $75.00. This is a great substitute. The sound is clear and crisp and there will never be another like him. (Although at this writing he is still alive) What many people don't know about Les Paul is what an inventor he was. He was the first to do double-tracking where the same person's voice is recorded over another track and he did it on wax discs! Mary Ford was one of the greatest singers of all time and probably underrated compared to her contemporaries. When you hear Tennessee Waltz you can't help thinking you are listening to Patti Page. If I have one very small gripe it is that I could have done without some of the talking but that is a small thing and may charm others."
4,missed synthdance from the end of the new wave era,"Just as new wave dance music was about to be washed out by 90s techno and house, acts like Kon Kan and Celebrate the Nun were just being signed to record deals--and as a result, most had about one fairly popular single. Boxcar was pretty much overlooked, but this is an extremely catchy dance album that screams Kon Kan, Electronic, late 80s era New Order--think ""Round and Round"" and ""Vanishing Point."" The male vocals are incredibly similar to New Order.Well worth adding to your collection of 80s synthdance music."
3,ALARM CAR,GOOD PRODUCT CONSIDERING THE PRICE GREAT QUALITY AS WELL GOOD AND STYLISH AS WELL FOR THE PRICE IS A GREAT ALARM
3,should be a five star...,"to put it simple, this is a great watch, i love this set, but i wish i could understand it or watch it not on mute. To explain, the voice actors were the worst!! it's one of those movies, and if you watch anime you'd know, where they give a chick that shoots people the most annoying high pitched soft spoken girly voice they can find on the planet. I can't listen to this anime because of the voice. it is that annoying, i hope some others point this out for people interested, but i hope that won't stop you from buying it."
5,When will America get it?,"Once again the Brits have us beat with their taste in music. This album is brilliant yet you can't even get it here without buying it on import. If your tired of listening to the same American rehash we've been hearing ever since ""Nevermind"" give this a try. You won't regret it"
3,what can I say? We`ve heard them better!,"In this record, I`m quite dissapointed. With International Welvet I thought Catatonia finally was back on track again, but it looks like I was wrong. This CD is too booring...easy as that. The moment of joy is when Cerys Matthews with her sugarlips sings ""make hey, not war"" on the song ""dead from the waist down"" Cerys voice is exactly what makes me give it three stars instead of two! I know Catatonia will make a great record if they only try - they`ve got all the potential!!! As a big fan I can only sit down and wait..."
5,Excellent Altan album after a series of slumps (the best since Island Angel),"In my opinion, Altan hasn't released a single good album since Island Angel until now. After the death of Frankie Kennedy, they got worse and worse, culminating in the horrible Blue Idol with irrelevant guest artists and poorly conceived tracks. However, that appears just to be a slump.Local Ground picks up right where Island Angel left off, showing a mature band in top form. ""Eirigh 's Cuir Ort Do Chuid Eadaigh"" is one of my favorite songs and hearing Altan perform it is such a delight. Mairéad ní Mhaonaigh's voice is perfect for this song and it reminds me of Altan's recording of Dulaman several years earlier. The sets on this album are impeccably performed and the guests on this album are both relevant and sensitive to the power of Altan's playing.Overall, an excellent CD that rivals the playing on their first albums. I highly recommend it!"
2,bush bashers need to get a life,"for real,i used to love otep until she fell into the same stupid trap of bashing a wonderful and intelligent and listen up you stupid liberals: HARD WORKING president like president bush.the music isn't as strong as i would have liked and her singing (well if you call it that) just doesn't do it for me.two stars for hanging around.all you bands need to get over it and face the facts: bush will win in november and otep's words will be lost in the shuffle."
1,"Gee, haven't seen this before","Wow, you mean this is a nu-metal band that does nothing but whine about their problems with pathetic self loathing lyrics?!?!?! I have never seen that before. This is total trash. 99% of the bands in this genre are garbage. Also, anybody who compares these guys to Pantera should be beaten without mercy."
4,SIK!,Otep are hard and depressing if you happened to stumble onto this cd you might need a pill or a bullet or both.There is no balance to these songs not grouped or individually they just sputter and crash like so many corpse off a bridge at dawn.Like Sevas Tra Otep are a band you either love or HATE!!!Its that simple.nuff said.
2,Not my kind of metal,I'm not really a big fan of Otep but I liked some of her songs to give this album a listen. I thought it was alright through a first few listens but I didn't feel too interested in it anymore - this music is really angry and depressing (very personal stuff). It's just not my kind of music I listen to over and over again.
1,"1 1/2 good songs. Yup, that's about it.","Sepsis and the first 1:30 of Hooks & Splinters is great - remeniscent of Seves Tra (still their best work). The rest is dissodent, atonal, wandering, b-side grade material. Warhead's ""ok"" but who wants to hear Michael Moore propaganda smashed out to hardore riffs? Less politics, more music please!"
3,JUST LISTEN TO WARHEAD!!!!!!,"First of all I'm not a big Otep fan, but Warhead is awesome! Ofcourse thats coming from some who hates the lying, murdering tyrant that is BUSH. If don't see it the same way as her and I, thats ok, your just a bi-product of mass minipulation. I must have heard this song 500 times and its due for 500 more. Plus Joey from Slipnot plays the drums and this track. All in all the whole goth thing is not for me. I love free speach, and free point view. Thats why I love metal and the chic form Otep! However if you like dark slow goth like music ""mostly chics"" sorry guys, then you should dig all of Otep albums including this one.THIS IS A CATASTRAPHE, WEAPONS SYSTEM ACTIVATED PURATINS HAVE INVAIDED!!! DO YOU-MY FRIEND NEED A GAS MASK."
5,Pure Genius!,"This album is awesome because the girl sounds like Wendy the Retard from the Howard Stern show!I dont know about you but, i think Wendy(otep) screaming over loud music is genius!!!especially if you liked when Wendy was goin crazy over her power outage^^mixed with sum guitars deserves an Emmy!!!"
1,My God...,"I only gice this 1 star why? Only Warhead is the only good song and 1 or 2 othyers that are ok, What happend?? Sevas Tra is a f**king amazing cd! Brutal and Insane!...And now this? I really hope if they do make a CD they go back to there OLD STYLE! Just take this cd and throw it out the window when your driving, and dig and ifnd that old Otep cd and blast Blood Pigs!"
2,it was ok,i don't get this album it really isn't that goodto industrial sounding for me i love metal but never like industrial metal its too boring and so is this albumif you want a good female vocalist on a metal album try KITTIE
2,Bad Secrets,"This isnt the Otep we've come to know and love. Jihad and Sevas Tra were amazing cd's. The lyrics were original and filled with all kinds of emotion, and the singing was hardcore. In House of Secrets it seemed Otep lost some of that edge. Still good music, but kind of a let-down."
5,House of ... Metal,"After listening to OTEP's first fullength album, Sevas Tra.After listening to short clips of the songs on otep.com and on Abominations.After reading that OTEP had mr Joey Jordison banging some drums at 6 tracks of the album.After reading awsome userfeedbacks on their Board.After waiting somewhat 4+ months from the first date the new album was anounced.So you see, for this album my expectations were Pretty High to say the least.And what did i get?I got a CD with a very tight crew, you could almost feel the extra studio time this album had compared to their previous.I got a CD with some Intresting instrumental combinations.I got a CD with the previous Metal-Rap mixture, is completely blown away.I got a CD with Metal and Poetry mixed, into one savvy blend.I got a HEAVY CD.Artists, Metal heads: its worth every penny."
2,Wow.....,"I own all of oteps other albums, and at one time I owned this one too. The song warhead is absolutely great. And house of secrets has it's good points too. HOWEVER, this could be the most depressing album I have ever listened to in my entire life. It put me in such a bad mood that i actually had to sell it. I liked Sevas Tra and I love the new one, ascension. This one could go down as one of my least favorite albums. Just way too depressing."
4,Not so good as Sevas Tra,"When I first listened to ""House of Secrets"" I got a little disappointed not just for the lyrics, but for the sound itself. What you have to do is open your mind... and try to understand the evolution the band is going trough (new members).I'm really sorry she is not insisting in fighting for women's rights as much as she was in Sevas Tra for example in ""menocide"". I think she's in a narcissist stage now.. the most part of the lyrics talk about her.Anyway her voice is still amazing and she still sings with all she has to give, so if you want to hear not only good music, but Art buy this CD."
3,title of review,"The songs are loosely structured. The riffs are meandering and almost never lock into a catchy groove. There's very little here to get into. The songs all feel like a mishmash of underdeveloped ideas. I don't dislike the album, I'm just disappointed. I liked their first album, but thought they had the potential to do better, to make an album that is great rather than good. With this album they've proven me wrong. If you own their first album I don't think there's any need to pick up this new one. The metal riffs are all very similar, still sounding a lot like Slipknot (pre-wussout) with no progression or improvement, and there are more quiet parts where the music just seems to be played for the sake of it, to make background noise and atmosphere, with little regard for composing any substancial chord progressions and melodies. To fans of conceptual art, this album may be worthwhile. To fans of music, I say look elsewhere."
1,HOW BORING!!,"I thought I was buying an album from a Heavy Metal band that played music! Instead I bought an album of horrible, boring poetry that has some musical interludes thrown in as an afterthought. I was bored out of my mind! During each track I waited for the next song, hoping to hear some music, some glimpse of the band that played on their debut album. It didn't really happen. I was totally disappointed! Here's my poem: Save your cash, this stuff is trash. Let Otep keep their secrets in their own house!"
3,Not very impressed,"Otep, like Atreyu, Killswitch Engage, and countless other bands that I've heard such rave reviews over, don't offer anything special on ""House of Secrets"". Featuring a female singer, who you'd never guess was a female until you see the band, Otep shows great promise to become something special, but almost everything on ""House of Secrets"" is average at best. ""Requiem"" and ""Buried Alive"" are solid tracks, but the rest borderlines on mediocrity. The music itself is generic sounding metal riffs with some poetry laden vocals and talking in the beginning of the songs. Otep's ""House of Secrets"" may be worth a look for metalheads looking for something different, but with other bands out there like Soilwork, Morbid Angel, Black Label Society, and Biohazard; you're better off looking elsewhere."
2,What a let down from there first 2 CDs,I was expecting to be blown away with this CD after loving the first 2. To much chat and not enough music....what happened to the low end grow ...the driving beat... The music! They {she} needs to get back to what made them get noticed. With the exception of 3 tracks I have to give this CD a thumbs down.
2,TOO MUCH BITCHING,"I sorta knew when i bought this that there was gonna be way more crying and bitching from Otep. The songs are OK but Sevas Tra is much better. It was cool to hear jon davis from korn do it on thier first album and it was cool for the first few songs from Otep. But she just over did it this time. I wanna hear some actual songs. Not just tracks of some poetry with bending guitar notes and cymbal rolls. If you're gonna say poetry, at least make an actual song out of it."
2,dissapointed,"i had been waiting for this cd ever since i played out sevastra. i was happy to see that they stayed away from rock/rap whatever the heck its called. but they made up for it with the long boring ""i'm a depressed angry girl"" poems and her awful attemps to sing, making her sound kinda, almost like shreyl crow. when are they gonna learn that we just want a whole cd full Blood Pig type songs"
2,Not what I was Expecting,"This one just didn't have the same effect as Sevas Tra. Sevas Tra is excellent. What happened here? Where did the good songs go? What happened to those wierd, creepy sounds on songs like Thots? It was different and I liked it. But this one bombed. The only good songs are Warhead and Burried Alive. Other than that its just mindless screaming. Sevas Tra, in my opinion wasn't so much mindless screaming as this one. Sevas Tra had this wierd, intense feeling I had never felt before in any kind of music. Not House of Secrets.Skip this one. It gets two stars for Warhead and Burried Alive."
4,Hooks and Splinters...,"Yes this is different than Sevas Tra, but that's not a bad thing, not at all. I thought this CD was great. 'Burried Alive' is by far my favorite one here. I think her voice is infectious, creepy, but infectious. 'Hooks and Splinters' is great as is 'Warhead' which I heard was about Bush...and that's why I gave this only 4 stars. I'm getting kinda tired of the political crap in music today...My opinion but it's a little lame. Find another topic..."
5,Awesome to work on your own car,Simply a must-have tool in your garage if you like working on your own car. Last time I saved $600 by doing it myself. It is a little complicated to get used to the way the book works and how they send you to different sections during the same repair. But if you are patient and read the whole repair first then it is very doable.
1,Not happy...,They sent me the wrong CD. I sent them an e-mail to point out their mistake. I never got a reply.
2,Still missing scenes!,"There are still scenes missing from this season. Many of the Roseanne episodes have opening scenes, and there arne't any in this dvd. I'm disappointed because I bougth this dvd thinking that the episodes are unedited."
5,Roseanne,"LOve the video. Will have for years to come. Wish you could get more from the earlier years, do not care for those of the last few seasons. Would order again from this vender."
5,I couldn't go back to a trackball if you forced me to...,"WOW. I cannot expressed what a difference an optical mouse makes. I now have one of these for each of my computers at home and when I go to work and have to deal with the trackball, I just want to scream. The transistion is so smooth, at first you will think it is too smooth, but you get used to it pretty quickly. Logitech, in my opinion, is the best computer accessory company. Buy this mouse."
4,"Works fine, Click a little too loud","Works fine and was at a great price. If i were to get picky, I'd say the click was a little too loud."
4,VeryGood Product!!,"The mouse work wonderfull specially because you forget about it, it will never start working wrong because it doesn't get stuck anyware with anything! the only problem is when you have to format your thisk and reinstall windows, since it's a USB device you need an old ps2 or serial mice to do the dirty installation job."
5,Good Optical Mouse,"If you're looking for a good quality optical USB mouse, this is a terrific option. I recommend highly."
2,Not Compatible with Docking Stations,"I called Logitech about the way the scrolling was not working, and they attributed the problem to the fact that I was hooking it up to a laptop through a docking station. (Dell Inspiron)I love the look and feel of the mouse, and the button action feels good, but I really wanted the scroll wheel to work."
1,Terrible Lag,"This mouse goes into hibernation after a second of inactivity. There is then a second or so of lag after you move the mouse again before the cursor moves again. This makes the mouse UNUSABLE for games! It also makes it very frustrating to do any fine work with CAD or graphics.The sort of lag I am talking about is typical of cordless mice, where, as your would it expect, it has to conserve as much battery power as possible. But this is a not a cordless mouse! It seems that logitech used the same parts from their cordless mouse in this corded one and the results are terrible. To make matters worse sometimes the mouse doesn't want to wake up at all without physically picking it up and shaking it violently. At other times it appears to sleep, then wake randomly on its own. In some apps the mouse cursor vanishes off screen entirely when the mouse decides to sleep, then reappears on the other side of the screen. Like I said, its unusable for games."
3,A Good mouse but......,This is a good mouse but it dosen't track well on my glass desk. I was forced to use a mouse pad even though the reason I bought an optical mouse was to get rid of my mouse pad.
5,Great,Shipped out fast and in original packaging. Great Condition. Would defineately recommend seller.
1,worst mouse ever,The mouse jumps up and down on the screen like it is a live mouse. Never ever buy this model any more. Go for the similar microsoft product. I have been satisfied with that product until it was stolen.
4,Works Great,"The Optical Wheel Mouse was easy to configure and use. I found that after installation, if it is connected at boot up the driver loads allowing me to use the third button as programmed. If I plug it in after the boot, the programmed button does not work as it uses the generic driver. Size of mouse was suitable for me and I found it works much better than the ball system for precise graphics editing. I am using it on a white patterned formica desk with no problem."
4,Too Small For BIG Hands,It is a GREAT product. It has no delay in going across the screen. It is a product made for small hands but if you have bigger hands you might want to keep shopping.Its appearance is slick and appealing. I reccomend this product to those who rest their palm on the pad or if you have smaller hands.
5,Just a good mouse. A very good mouse.,"This mouse is great. Nothing extra: just simple, regular ergonomic mouse, VERY accurate and very convenient to use. Works on any usual surface. Not that good on a naked lap or arm, but this is not what you use as a surface that often, really :) This mouse is good-looking too: I don't mean only this black and silver casing, but it's got transparent sides and bottom which lets it glow with red! Ahh..! I like it! I also took advantage of that mail rebate offer and bought it together with a Logitech Elite black keyboard. These two things together make a great set and I'm really happy with it."
1,Logitech rocks!!,"I miss the Logitech mouse with the weird force-feedback (I don't know if it's still out there, I'll have to look), but that one lasted for 6 years, even after the ""buzz"" function went away. I hope this one is as resilient!"
5,"I'm not going to argue, but...","Hey,What's with bashing Microsoft mice? I own a Microsoft Trackball Explorer, and it works just fine, no ""cheap"" noise or anything. I'm not saying this mouse is bad though, cause it couldn't get this good a rating if it was bad. I suppose it's all a matter of preference. Also, my Microsoft mouse refreshes at a rate of 1,500 times/sec, which, if I remember properly is...150 hertz?PEACE!!!"
1,oh god,"This mouse is oo unbelievably bad, they shouldnt even waste valuable plastics on its production, it must be stopped"
2,"New Mac owners, beware!","If you own a Mirror-Door G4 tower (Mac), be aware that you may be buying a mouse that you won't be able to use after the first 2 hours. When I first plugged it in, I loved it completely. It's very smooth and responsive, and feels like you're mousing on silk. However, after my Mac went to sleep, then woke up again, the mouse wouldn't recognize any movement at all. I can still right- and left-click, and use the scroll wheel, but any efforts to move it even a pixel in any direction fail. The red light that glowed in the beginning doesn't light up at all now, so I suspect that the optical sensor is dead somehow. An email to Logitech got me the (fast and polite) response that they are aware of a problem with ""dual processor"" Macs, and are working on a fix, which they will post to their website. I would have given this mouse 1 star, except that it DID work at the beginning. If it still worked, I'd give it 5 stars without hesitating."
5,The Better Mouse,"I have worked in Tech Support for some time now so I have used many different mice, but I have never found a mouse with as high a level of quality and precision as a Logitech Mouse. The benefits of an Optical Mouse over a ball mouse are many, and in this case the price is also quite nice. Anyone who has used a Logitech mouse knows that they are far superior to Microsoft mice in many ways. This mouse is NO exception! I fits right or left handed people and has a much better feel. I have noticed that the wheels on Logitech mice seem to stick less than MS mice also. If you need precision, and hate having to continually clean your ball mouse than this mouse is a MUST HAVE!"
5,Great mouse for less $,"If you want an optical mouse, I think this is the one to go for. It's less expensive that Microsoft's, and Logitech is a trusted name. I got mine to use with my laptop (the little red mouse button IBM makes causes my tendinitis to flare up), and it works just fine through USB. The packaging is a little weird (there is a flashing red light on the box, run by batteries, that kind of alarms a person when you open the package), and I wonder if Logitech couldn't have cut the price just a tad by not having that extra, but otherwise, this is a great mouse. It's all you need in an optical one."
4,Great Value,This mouse costs less than most optical mice and it is very comfortable. I use it with my laptop and I love it. Since it is optical there is no need to clean the insides of the mouse and it tracks on almost any surface so you don't need to pack a mousepad in with your laptop.
4,Good but Some Problems,"It is a very comfortable mouse and the scrolling is very smooth but the pointer has a tendicy to jump and dissapear, this is very noticable when playing games, other than that reason its is a very good mouse"
4,Close to perfection!,"This mouse is a boon if you are still using older rollerball based mouse. Its very smooth and very responsive and less prone to wear and tear. On top of that it has the swanky red glow underneath shouting for attention :-).The only thing missing on this mouse is a set of two extra buttons on the sides for going back/forward while browsing. As a workaround I have programmed my wheel-click for Back button and I don't think forward is as much useful for me.I've been using this very happily since last 1 month.One piece of advice: try to use this with a dark, preferably black, mousepad/surface since the darker the surface the more responsive this gets. I guess its true for all optical mouses."
3,"Nice and smooth, but...","I've found that optical mice are incredibly superior when compared to traditional ball mice. They effortlessly glide across your mousepad (assuming that your surface isn't reflective or glossy at all, then they tend to get a little confused.) This mouse is a nice relatively inexpensive way to get that. ...As great as that seems, the scroll wheel (on Logitech mice in general) is pretty [poor]. It's very choppy, it sometimes goes several clicks before it decides to start scrolling, and it often keeps going after you've stopped scrolling. It was very frustrating at first, I'm now sadly used to it."
1,Wild Mouse,Got tired of my old mouse of not working properly so I replaced it with this Logitech optical mouse. For the first few days I was delighted with it and then it started acting very erratic - jumping all over the screen - very difficult to use at times and hard to be accurate with it. Am currently looking for a replacement.
5,I love this mouse!,"This is probably the best mouse or at least the best cord mouse ever. It doesn't get stuck with me. It has it's own scroll wheel, and it's much better than your average mouse. However I always recomend the wireless one, but if you wanna play it safe with a normal mouse, then this one I recomend. I am very pleased with it. Handles well. Maneuvers well. Feels great on the hands. All frustrations with the average cord mouse dissapated with this one. I strongly recomend purchasing this."
5,this mouse is excelenté,"This mouse, though basic, is really, truly, excellent. For me, it is replacing mein apple pro mouse. Not only is it Mac OS X compatible, it is pre-configured; Plug it in and go, nothing to load. The Disk that comes with the package though does not have the OS X package installer on it, however, so if you want to customize the experience (read: Button programing) you will need to load a 10 meg installer from the manufacturer website. Once you have it however, you find yourself wishing for more buttons. All in all, a great mouse, perfect for anybody, power user or newbie, and all that live in between. An excellent upgrade from the monotony that is one button. Indeed."
5,Tips on Optical Mice,"Optical mice are wonderful. I use two different optical mice, one at work, the other at home. Both are Logitech because they are the best I've experienced. You'll find a wider range of mouse movement without a lot of hand movement. The things you will want to remember in order to keep your mouse working properly are - keep the optical sensors clear of dust, etc. (your dog's/cat's hair, fuzz bunnies, etc.) and make sure you use a solid mousepad (no pretty pictures, etc. - they confuse the sensors). I'm sure you'll be happy with your experience!"
1,Logitech Wheel Mouse .................. not the right one,"I purchased this wheel mouse and after trying to use it on ""almost any kind of surface"" as the literature claims; you can't. You need a mouse pad or it doesn't move at all. It contacted Logitech and they informed me that this mouse is an oudated discontinued model. Don't waste your time."
5,"Ergonomic, excellent mouse - software buggy","The mouse itself is very nicely designed and cool looking. I use it with my Apple Mac G5. The optical tracking is great, no moving parts. The scroll wheel is indispensable for browsing the web and scrolling through documents. I just wish the software that comes with it would be more stable, less buggy. I had to uninstall it and use another mouse driver with more options, functions and less bugs."
4,Does what it is supposed to do...,"Simply put this mouse does what it is supposed to do.I bought it as my first optical mouse in Feb 2003, with a rebate I believe it was $15. It is going on two years of moderate use and it is still working fine.The only con to it would be that it is not ergonomically designed, but for $10-20 more you can get yourself a wireless optical mouse that IS ergonomically designed. As well I don't think it bills itself as ""ergonomic"".My job requires working in tradeshows and we had bought this mouse to replace our old wheel mice (about 10 of them). The Logitech Corded Optical Wheelmouse are cheap (in price) and you don't have to worry about junk gumming up the internals of the mouse.As I have used this mouse mainly for web browsing and clicking through MS office applications it has served its purpose very well.I would suggest this mouse as a ""first mouse"" for a young child learning to work on a computer. Look, the peanut butter and jelly wipes right off the optics!"
5,Best Mouse I've Ever Owned,"This is the most comfortable and easy to use mouse that I have ever owned or used. It is very precise with selections, and provides ease of navigation that I've never experienced before. Highly recommend this product."
3,"Ok mouse for the price, suggest a different logitech mouse","This mouse is okay for the price. I would suggest a Logitech MX, a little bigger mouse for comfort. A mouse with more than three buttons is suggestable."
3,Good Product.,Optical tracking system is very good. The scroller wheel is smooth.Very comfortable to work.
5,"Accurate, elegant, and hassle-free","I bought this mouse to replace a Kensington trackball. The trackball was getting repeatedly clogged with dirt and was becoming increasingly inaccurate. This optical mouse solved both of those issues as soon as it was connected to the PC. It's phenomenally accurate and a joy to use -- any surface seems to satisfy it. Plus, it's quite inexpensive. Mouse heaven. :-)"
3,hmmmm,"This is a nice mouse, but I find it jerky when used a certain wood grained surface. I think my desk surface has a wood grain pattern that is difficult for the sensor to adapt to. But the Microsoft optical mice work perfectly on this same desktop. Other than that, this is a good product."
4,And The Logitech Shall Set You Free....,"Brothers and sisters, I was once like you...burdened and bound by the sinister immobility of the common trackball....meticulously digging with my fingernail at the sinful iniquities that tended to collect in that little satanic recess on the underside...blowing the breath of futility into that little hole and slamming it repeatedly on its hellish accomplice the mouse pad when it refused to move the little cursor across the screen...But then friends, I found the light of Logitech...In particular, the little red light at the bottom. It eliminates the need for the mouse pad and for taking out the little ball and cleaning it. You really can run it off of every surface. If you get the cordless one you can run it anywhere (but what for? Then you'll be changing batteries...just stick to the one with the wire. You've got to stay in your chair to type anyhow.).Fall down on your knees and repent, users!"
4,watch out for shiney surfaces,"i love this mouse.if only it were cordless.works without a hitch.one problem do not try to use on a desktop that is reflective.use a pad.the light comes back to its self.duh you say,ok but we all want to elinminate the pad.worth the price.."
2,Its scroll is the worst among Logitech optical mouse,"The scroll is heavy, noisy and gets stuck sometimes especially forward. I have a cheaper white Logitech optical mice(USB/PS2) and it works great. The only thing I don't like from this previous mice is its bright color. So I bought this black one. Movement is the same but I could not scroll smoothly like the Logitech Optical Mouse (USB/PS2). It doesn't worth to return the item but I hate to touch the scroll of this mice. Try at a shop before you decide to buy it."
5,Balless Wonder,"My old ball mouse started acting weird, so I thought I'd upgrade. I'm glad I did. This thing is smooth. Unlike conventional mice there is almost no resistance when moving it around. It's very precise. Don't listen to anyone who still likes mice with balls, they're living in the past. For the price I would have to highly recommend this."
3,Great Series..... Poor packaging.,"Masters of Horror is one of those series that comes along every 10 to 15 years. More Tales from the Crypt than Twlight Zone, This series gives you horror tales directed by some of the greatest horror movie directors of the big screen. My only gripe is that its not a boxed set of the whole season. This might be the route to go if you watched the whole series on Showtime and only want to get the few episodes you really liked. True Horror fans will most likely wait for the boxed set of the series."
3,"Brilliant, Complex and A Bit of a Challenge","The interwoven stories of residents of an unspecified Egyptian town and the Imam for whom their worlds revolve, The Fall of the Imam is profound, poetic, and complex. The narration is uncovential in English and does pose some challenge for English speaking readers. First person and third person narration seem to be employed interchangeably, with the perspective switching from character to character frequently. I suspect that in the Arabic in which it was written, The Fall of the Imam is beautiful and brilliant. The English translation, however, may prove somewhat difficult for western readers. Regardless, it is a worthwhile read and does provide a glimpse into a world many westerners are largely unfamiliar with."
5,Toe-taping Instrumental,I have several James Last CDs. This is my favorite. The variety is wonderful and proves that a symphony orchestra can improve on the original vocal hit by its rich and numerous instruments.
2,Country road took a detour.,"I have several CDs and DVDs by James ""Hans"" Last. This one is OK but not the same quality of arrangements as some of his other works."
2,Not very entertaining,"Most of these shorts are really low budget and aren't really that groundbreaking. I feel like some of them are trying too hard to be artistic and weird. Get it if you are a major indie short film enthusiast, but it's not really suited for people like me who only dabble in indie short films."
4,Heavy Lifting,I ordered this protection filter to use with my Sony NEX-5 with the 18-55 mm lens. It was beautifully made with very nice multi-coated glass. Only downside was the weight. The filter is indeed solid with the ring composed of brass. But it seemed to work against the design philosophy of the NEX-5 which emphasizes compactness and low weight. I returned the filter and purchased the similarly priced Sony (VF-49MPAM) protection filter made of aluminum with Zeiss coatings.
3,NO operational CD !!,"Hi,This is my second sewing machine. Machine is great and loaded with great features. But if you need to find out a new feature or you are new to this machine be ready to spend 1 hr or more to read the operational manual , because this machine even though a computerized one does not come with an instructional CD. If you need one, you have to pay out of pocket again and pay s/h extra. I found it very disappointing since almost everything now a day comes with a CD and we are getting so used to it, reading the whole manual is very time consuming and difficult to understand. so if you planning to buy this machine, you may want to rethink about it. Whether you are ready to read the manual every time or go for another model?Priya"
5,Black & White Pomade,Black & White Pomade works much better then most of the other pomades on the market.It holds hair shape all day and its not stiff and crunchy .. it smells great too!Would recommend to others !
4,Toslink GOOD,Fairly inexpensive and works. What more can you ask from a length of fiber optic cable.
4,Only for the young'uns,"I'm 16 and I flew through the game. It was pretty good fun, but after a while it got a bit boring and there was a part in the game (I think it's faulty) when if you don't quite jump over something, the horse gets stuck!It's good for the little kids who like to be challenged as well, as it's not that easy.It's a good game also for the people who love horses and horseriding."
5,Great game!,"VERY FUN! U finally get to make your own horse! Very nice.Pro's: MAke your own horse and name it anything u want, go anywhere on free ride, and the outfitscon's: No ability to ride in water except for crossing parts, U don't get to do the grooming, limited color choices, and annoying reminders. BR>OTHER WISE, BUY THIS GAMMMME!!!"
2,Not as great as it sounds,"We bought this game for our 5 year old and it is a very frustrating game to deal with. The menu is not at all intuitive. It is supposed to allow two players, but we (adults and kids together) couldn't figure out how to get the game started. There must be a way, but we simply can't figure it out by following the menu or the instruction booklet."
2,Winners Circle,I bought this game because I thought it looked fun and I love horses. I was very dissapointed with it though. It gets very boring after the third or fourth time you've played it. Sometimes I place first and one of the twins (not sure wich one i am not a huge fan of the olsen twins) says I did bad. The graphics are horrible and on the free ride the ribbons are no where to be found. This game could have been alot better but like I said it is fun the first few times you play it.
3,Glad I didn't buy it!!!,"I rented this game from Blockbuster, and am very glad I did. If I would have just gone out and bought this game for 40 bucks I would have been really mad. It's really hard and kinda dumb. I would not recommend this game to any little girls like under eight. It's way too confusing, I think. If I were you, I would DEFINATELY rent this game before you go out and buy it!!!!"
1,I DID NOT RECEIVE MY PRODUCT!!!!!,I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THE PRODUCT!!! I HAVE NOT BEEN BILLED BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT!!!
4,A few minor things worth mentioning.,"Pros*Well builtGreat filterGreat soundCons*Terrible hose clampsSlight machining errors (performance non-affecting)Color is slightly darker than shown.Overall this product did exactly what it was intended to do. Install was a cinch and it produces a nice deep throaty sound when throttling, accommodated by the sound of the filter ""hissing"" which is the airflow."
4,Please get it out on spanish!,"I saw this two films on spanish,a nd t he dubbing is great!, Eugenio Derbez does an excelent work on the second one, this 2 films aregreat, they are the best live action films hthat Disney has evermade."
1,"Tiny, tiny, tiny!!!....and OVERPRICED FOR THE SIZE!!!","Well, I have a Carruth Leafman masque that looks very much like the online image for this one. HOWEVER, this thing is a tiny, little, itzy, bitzy thing!! AND definitely NOT worth the price....DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE!!!!! I was expected a masque sized normal hanging like the other one. Buyer be very careful...I won't buy from this vendor ever again!!!"
2,"Not what is expected, but use it anyway.","The product description seems to suggest that the mast is five feet in length. But the one I received is only about four and a half feet in length. However, the mast is a very sturdy piece of steel.The product sketch also seem to suggest that you can connect two masts together. So, I ordered two. Connecting two together would make a nine feet mast - not ten because they are not five feet in length. However, due to the construction of the coupling the connection is not stable at all. The construction is not as the sketch seem to suggest. I end up making do with only one mast, and did not connect the other one."
3,Sturdy but ugly,"I ordered this item from Polstein's recently. While it seems to be a sturdy anodized mast (produced in China under the ""Gemini"" brand), it is also a hideous metallic gold color. This, unfortunately, is not mentioned in the product description or is apparent from the missing photo. I'll also note that the item from Polstein's was scratched up quite a bit. So far, no reply from Polstein's on an exchange or return despite a couple of emails sent to them."
1,The gauge of the metal is much too thin,"The gauge of the metal used in this mast is, in my opinion, much too thin to rely on it to hold my antenna and survive the winter winds here where I live. I just threw this one away and went to a local electronics store and purchased another mast that was at least 4 times heavier than this one."
4,Sturdy,"Had to replace a 20 year old antenna hit by a tree. These are exactly the same, price was fair. Appear to be pretty sturdy, moderate weight so one person can handle. Color not great but identical to what I had.Usevto mount weather system, used previously for tv antenna"
3,Scott Cole chair strength and stretch dvd,"I personally think the order of the program should be reversed, that is, with the stretching segment first. The strength part is not for me - WAAAYYY too much bending at the knee, very painful for my 60 yr. old knees, so I simply skip this part. Had I known the strength part was so knee intensive I would not have purchased this dvd. I've done yoga for several decades so find that the positions are not held long enough for me. I usually pause the dvd so that I can hold the positions longer, as long as my body wants to. At some point, I will write the sequence out as pause/play is cumbersome. The stretches are good and I've learned a few new ones, expanding my knowledge base. I would not recommend this dvd for folk w/knee issues whatever their age."
2,Very one sided.,"I felt that Murphy doesn't even try to be balanced. He uses words like ""witches brew"" and ""cauldron"" to conjure negative images. Also, the book is somewhat outdated, even though this last reprint was 2005. The most recent information I saw was 1989, and he gives facts that are outdated, including that there is no chickenpox vaccine. Now, all this is coming from a person who is skeptical about vaccines. I just didn't find the book tasteful, or all that helpful. Much better is ""The Baccine Book"" by Robert W. Sears. He gives facts, but helps you to come to your own decision regarding each individual vaccine rather than making blanket statements about all vaccines."
3,Flawed...,"This is the third full length release from The Church. I'm a new convert to this band and have recently been digging into their catalog quite a bit. Unfortunately, this is one of their early albums that I find myself reaching for the least. In my opinion it's a mild digression from the brilliant album that came before it, The Blurred Crusade and is far surpassed by the album following it, Heyday. There are a couple of strong songs on this, but they are often marred by overly processed and ridiculously dated production techniques. For a better taste of what this band was capable of at this point in their career, check out the EP collection Remote Luxury."
3,Reissue sounds great,"A ploy to get you to buy what you bought before, this remastered edition of Seance isn't a bad thing; it's a common trend among the major labels. If you bought it once, why not buy it again now that we've spiffed it up a bit. Regardless of that fact, Seance is a bit more consistent than their second album but also sounds a bit more dated as well. Perhaps its the cheesy sythesizers. I don't listen to this as much as, say, Heyday but it's still worth picking if you haven't purchased it on CD before.Why the videos weren't put on a DVD (with a separate layer for the b-sides), is beyond me. Oh, wait a minute, they'll probably bring that out next week."
5,Good for algebra teachers,This books helps to write in math. I like it because it gives good ideas that I can expand on.
2,Another good movie marred by sloppy DVD manufacturing,"Strand Releasing should be barred from releasing any more movies. They really don't care about the movies they've got in their stock as there have always been no special features, always burnt-in subtitles, always non-anamorphic widescreen, always low bitrate picture. Why bother stay in the DVD business anyway, let alone foreign movie DVD business?This movie once again proves those abovementioned points: 2.72GB of data, non-anamorphic, no extras. Yet it has a price tag of $24.99 SRP. This is called SHAMELESSNESS."
5,Happy with my hard to find glasses!,I bought all the Rigoletto line of glassware years ago and am finding replacements hard to come by these days unless you are willing to buy in commercial bulk (as it seems Libbey has bought this line an it is no longer in the pedestrian marketplace.) I was delighted to find a low quantity box available on Amazon for a reasonable price!
5,Great goblets!,"These goblets are great for wine (white or red) or any other drinks you might be serving to guests, or yourself. I am using one now to drink a strawberry smoothie! They make any drink taste extra special. I use mine every single day, even for drinking water."
3,Okay,This book is okay. It's not very in-depth. I would pay the extra money and get a more thorough study guide.
1,Quite useless,"It discusses in detail obvious stuff, and then references you to textbooks for more advanced topics. So it is more of a basic reference for the things you practice everyday, than a way to help you remember the topics you did during your undergrad degree"
1,Quite worthless,"Why this book is not worth buying:1.) The equations in the book does not match up with the equations used in the FE Supplied Reference book provided by NCEES during the FE exam so it's frustrating to study two sets of equations (with different units) for the same material. It'sinconvenient and time consuming.2.) Each chapter has a tiny review section that supplies equations and a few examples (if examples are provided) then users can try the practice problems at the end. The problem is that the review is VERY basic and hardly skims the surface of the subject matter therefore it is not enough for a thorough review of the subject. This means, I have to grab out my old textbooks and look up each topic and review from them if I still own the textbook.3.) Not as organized when compared to the FE Review Manual from Lindeburg (I use the FE Review Manual to study for the morning portion of the FE).All and all, not worth buying."
1,Not Recommended if you are looking for real help,"Feels like a slapped together attempt to make some money. No survey review. Most of the reviews are very confusing. The hydrology review is just a couple questions with manning's and Hazen equations. The review questions don't have real explained solutions. Don't waste time with this book, find something else."
1,Useless,"Talk about a big disappointment.I was expecting a book that would really help me prepare for the civil discipline specific portion of the EIT exam. Unfortunately this book only skims the top of major topics and does not go into any sort of detail whatsoever.It's not a complete book, i think it miss more than 50% of the course. My suggestion would be to leave this book alone and study from reference text books."
4,Good Intro Book,"This is a pretty solid introductory book to fundraising, donor management, proposals, etc. If you are new to the business I would definitely recommend it, though more experienced people might not find it quite as helpful. (though there are still a some good nuggets of information)"
3,Interesting but basic,I found this book somewhat basic. It seemed to more academic than practical. I would recommend looking at other books if you want practical information.
4,For my 3 year-old boy,"My three year old boy loves robots so I bought him this book, which he likes OK. The cover is a little wierd, but the inside of the book is fairly tame and informative."
1,Nothing but landfill fodder,"I don't know how they advanced the design of such a simple and basic tool, but whatever they did they need to undo. It failed to work out of the overabundant packaging. I tinkered with it, wiggled this, jiggled that, tried two or three different batteries and finally got it to kind of work i.e. you could see the light bulb filament illuminate if you squinted hard enough. However when I went to use it within a few days, it was useless. Some may contend I need counseling, but taking this thing by the tail and turning it into pieces provided the only modicum of satisfaction I got from it. I wouldn't recommend it to a casual acquaintance."
1,ATD Tester,"Advanced Tool Design Model ATD-5513 Heavy Duty Circuit TesterNo instruction on or in the package. I assume a battery is required, but nothing noted. Didn't see any mention in the Amazon Description or specifications.Maybe I'll have some luck returning it. Simpler to keep it for an ice pick?Herb"
4,does keep the oily off for a while,"it's a little thick, but a small amount goes a long way. it will keep the oils off your face for a while but don't be surprised if you have to reapply later on. perfect when you go out at night when spf is not a necessity. will look at other products though to compare, but i would buy this again."
5,Superb,"Superb. Very melodic. Love that base guitar and piano, even if piano is not your favourite instrument you'll love this one. Michael should be considered one of the greatest in this music field."
2,leaks,"No matter how much teflon tape I've placed on this, it continues to leak from the back connected to the main faucet when I leave the water on to a mainline out to my garden and timer. The quick connects stay on for a moment then slip and begin to leak. I yanked them off and threw them away. I much prefer the dials to turn the water on and off, now if I could only get the rear of the thing to quit leaking."
4,great piece,"works great, I have 3 gardens that I am using 3 seperate hoses for and this valve distributer is excactly what I needed. The quick connecters are a great feature."
4,"Maxi Poole, TV Newshound, is on the Job","The sudden death of Gillian Rose of Rose International, the country's largest manufacturer of vitamins, supplements, and health foods, headquartered in Los Angeles, is a mystery that stymies everyone, even the police. TV Six Anchorwoman Maxi Poole is one of the first on the scene, and soon she's right in the middle of all the action.Although the police wind up saying the death was by natural causes, Maxi believes otherwise and she has a few suspects, like Gillian's husband, his ambitious mistress and a wealthy entrepreneur from out of town in this glitzy novel that will take you right inside the TV news business.Ms. Lange, for years a Los Angeles TV journalist herself, knows what she's talking about when she describes her industry and it shows. She gives us ample clues and enough red herrings to keeps us guessing in this witty mystery."
5,Great book for digital video basics and tricks!,I bought this book and it helped me out a lot!Well worth the price. Right to the point learning!
3,Superficial and dated,"If you have a non-mini DV camera (HDD, mem card, etc.) you'll skip a good part of this book. It lingers about the technical difficulties of transferring a mini DV video to the computer, and also about storing mini DVs. That may be useful for mini DV users, but wasn't for me.I bought the second edition, that briefly mentions that there are another, newest media being used, but doesn't give any useful advice about this - on the contrary, seems to be a bit wary of these, doesn't add anything that an average computer user'd know. That part looks like a simple footnote to the previous edition.There are some good advice bits, and the general tone is home-video-oriented as proposed, but most parts (as editing in a home computer) lack more in-depth discussion.Overall, though you can learn something from this book, I'd recommend looking for a more comprehensive one or even going after good tutorials on the web."
4,Excellent guide for making great amateur home videos,"My home videos are better already because of this book! This book is not necessarily aimed at the pros, but at the amateur who wants to make better home videos. The information and tips are excellent, but some of the writing style could have used editing."
4,Classical Eighties Soul With A Sweet Twist,"Great Album, several classic songs, including amazing duet with Michael McDonald and the everlasting ""You Can't Take Me For Granted"""
2,What you expect is not what you get,"I was really disappointed with this cd by Aretha.It had all the potentiality to be a hit and it turns out...this!Burt Bacharach and Carole Bayer Sager definitely wrote better tracks than the ones handed over to Aretha for this album.Must admit the one with Michael Mcdonald is good, though - maybe with having in mind their previous # 1 smash sung by michael and Patti LaBelle?.The dancefloor tunes are ok, EVERYDAY PEOPLE is infectuous and the title track is very '90's R'n'B.The duet with Luther Vandross DOCTOR'S ORDERS is fun and uptempo, a grammy nominee...maybe a winner too? Can't remember...The rest is very mediocre; given the fact the woman's voice is no longer the one of the '60's/'70's and '80's is no excuse...Feels like all this material has been thrown in too fast to have an Aretha Franklin release on the market.Better job next time, 'Ree!"
3,How can one sweat when there is no HEAT?,"Sorry, but this is only an album for fans, of which I am one. It features some likeable tunes but it is far below anything done by the ""The Queen of Soul""."
2,Attempt at a Paula Abdul dance sound doesn't work here,"Aretha Franklin has always made quality music. Her reign as the Queen of Soul will never be replaced. But What You See Is What You Sweat is not one of her best albums. There's too much of attempt of her trying to go for that Paula Abdul dance sound on most of the uptempo numbers. Only Everyday People stands out because it's funky. But the other songs like Mary Goes Round, and the lame title song the members of Surface did, come off flat. Aretha sounds out of place on them and it would sound best if Paula or Janet Jackson did the songs. Doctor's Orders with Luther Vandross doesn't grab me. Everchanging Times with Michael McDonald and You Can't Take Me For Granted are both elegant ballads. But they seem lost on this dance driven album that doesn't fit with Aretha's always soulful voice."
4,Thunder Wagon from the Wind River Series,"I have been reading the Wind River series, and Thunder Wagon is proving to be as interesting as the first book was."
5,Very good read!,You need to read the entire series from book one through book seven to get the full story. Very good reading and very enjoyable. Good characters and interaction between them. Plots keep you guessing abut the relationships.
2,Why isn't...,"...Tom Waits' song, ""Underground"" on this? It was one of the greatest songs in the movie, because it went very well with the theming of the scene it was in, and they excluded it from the album. The only songs i'd reccomend this for are Ricky Fante's ""Shine"" and the score piece at the end. Otherwise, don't bother buying it."
1,Not for kids,"I got this soundtrack and I have to say it's not all that. I thought it'd be the songs from the movie but no. My daughter loves the ""Singin' In the Rain"" part but it's not on the soundtrack.Not only is the soundtrack incomplete, but there are songs that are totally inappropriate. This soundtrack is from a children's movie, aimed at children, and categorized by Amazon as CHILDREN'S MUSIC. Yes, there are things in life that we can't protect out children from. There are also things in life that we don't need to buy for our children - this is one of them. Save your money and buy the Lilo & Stitch soundtrack instead :D"
1,DO NOT BUY FOR YOUR KIDS!,"I got the dvd soundtrack set and omg I will never let a kid hear the cd ever. with lines from the song right thurr by chingy on the cd!""Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a l'il bit I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal"" ok what is that doing on a kids cd?!?!?! oh it gets better he has 2 songs on the cd I like that: ""Put ya hands upShake it fast on meI'm that pimp you needTen G's in tha pocket and I'm ready to rollI'm on fire like a rocket and I'm ready to blow"" in the real song it says nigga not pimp do you want your kid singing that?!"
4,The first album,"This album was Zoltan's first solo album. I think his music is dreamlike, sincere and passionate music.I also recommend to everybody, who is like the world jazz, should listen the newer album of Zoltán Lantos, called Mirrorworld."
4,"No real changes from last year, so still very solid","It has been said before and I'll say it again, this new version is almost exactly similar to its 2001 counterpart. The rosters have been updated, so A-Rod is on Texas here. The new stadiums from last year's version, such as Enron and Pac Bell have been ""spruced-up"" a bit, so they look nicer. TP 2001 was a great game, and since this year's version is the same, this is also a great game. However, if you are not into baseball that much, and own TP 2001, there is no real need to upgrade to TPB. Overall, it is what you would expect from an EA sports game."
1,what's new?,"This series has the best batter-pitcher interface, and graphics, but that's about all. The defense and base-running are terrible! It's pretty easy to use a conservative swing and go the other way, but the way the ball reacts after being hit is not good... I've been playing baseball games since the original RBI... I've owned and played at least 25 different bsaeball games, [but] this series is terrible!"
1,Did they just copy tp2001 and put Giambi on the cover?,"I decided to take this game from the video store a few days ago surprised to see it still there. A newly released game still there on a friday, wow that is a surprise. I had the knack taht this game would be very similar, i didn't think it would be almost EXACTLY the saem. Not a single new feature. If the game says its going to dazzle you with new rosters you know that there can't be much else. I'm also disturbed with why Buck Martinez is still anouncing. Buck, if you didn't know your coaching the Blue Jays pal. This game really got me mad. Other than new ballparks, the graphics, gameplay, announcing, and overall game is just the saem. 1 word, disgrace."
1,Triple Plague,"this game is horrible. no changes except for rosters....TP 2001 is the one to go with...EA Sports, i used to declare you guys as the epitome of the sports video game industry. sorry....you're losin more points every year, and this latest piece of garbage is added proof. how sad...to go from king of the hill to the court jester....sega sports baby...thats the way to go...dreamcast is where it's at...peace"
5,three's company season six,I would like to give this seller a very high rating. It arrived in good condition and I enjoyed it very much.
2,Average,"the show started losing steam around this point big time.I think the Chemistry was noticeable big time.while John Ritter was always funny,the show was losing it's pop.Joyce Dewitt was always on point&I had a crush on that chick&still like her,but the vibe of the show with the writing was missing something.Don Knotts was a trip though.without Suzanne Somers the show lost a certain edge it had&while the two ladys that replaced her had some moments,neither captured that certain ""IT' that Somers had."
2,Very small & not very impressive,"Bought this because, lucky me, it was in my Gold Box. What a rip. This sculpture is MUCH smaller than I imagined. No more Carruth stuff for this guy."
2,Less than satisfied,I searched high and low for a copy of this out of print book for my niece for Christmas. I loved it as a kid and knew she would as well.Was so glad this arrived before Christmas--scary to have to pay for shipping that would have almost covered priority shipping but only get the choice of something like parcel post and wait wondering if it is going to show up in time or not. Thank you very much for making sure that it did.I definitely purchased a hardcover copy though (just verified with my order info through Amazon) and was sent a paperback copy. A $32.61 paperback copy. That's just bad business.
4,OVER PRODUCED,"Through no fault of her own, this second CD from Bethany suffers from a recording disease known as ""overproductionitis"". The malady happens when, instead of letting the assets of the artist (in this case, Bethany's writing and soulful voice) shine through, the producer smothers both the message and the messenger with too much slick production. The CD is like a meal with too much seasoning spoiling what would otherwise be a tasty treat for the ears. Or worse, it's like a pristine pure sonic stream polluted by muddy production. That's sad, because this girl has real talent that needs to be showcased rather than concealed. On the postive side, the few songs on the CD that aren't overproduced sound GREAT -- like, for example, the title cut, ""Imagination."" Still, the CD is worth buying."
4,I't not the bets but i't still very good.,"i really love Dj's X.travagant's new cd Double Platinum! Of coure it is not as good as Sasha or Jhon Deegweed, but a wounderfull collection from a south hustler X.TRAVAGANT. i love it and i hope you'll love it too! and i just keep waiting for some new album to come out. ILYA LIL_T"
3,The Mourning,"I have bought 3 of these. 1 for the front yard, 1 for the backyard and one for a funeral. This is not only great for gardens, but can also be used for temporary headstones."
1,Know the ingredients before you order,"This product has two types of hydrogenated oil, artificial colors, and two types of MSG (MSG and hydrolyzed yeast extract). The company can be difficult to deal with- no notification if your shipment is delayed due to unavailable ingredients for example. It took several attempts via e-mail and phone calls to get anyone to answer why the order had not even shipped after the estimated delivery date. The shipping is outrageously high for the weight as well. Not what I have come to expect from an Amazon related company."
1,Nasty fake tasting lumpy sauce,I was hoping this would be similar to the powder found in boxed macaroni and cheese. It is not. Following the instructions on the package I created a disgusting mess that nobody in my household would eat. I had to throw out the pasta and start over.
1,Tastes terrible,"I wanted to start making my own mac and cheese instead of buying it, and had hoped this would work well. What I found was that it tastes terrible, I only managed two bites before I spit it out and threw it away. I guess my first clue should of been the greenish tint to the sauce in the daylight. I would not buy this again, and I would not recommend it to others."
3,Okay,This product is okay. It does what is suppose to do. I have no regrets. I am neutral regarding recommending the product.
2,Cheese Sauce,"I Liked the cheddar cheese topping better.But the kids loved this one, it is very cheesy and sauces up pretty good too."
1,Disappointment,"Says ""cheese sauce powder."" I was expecting a cheese sauce mix. Not so. It is powdered cheese flavor to add to a sauce you make."
4,"31 Drive In Cult Classics actually, read on...","Well, there are actually 31 films inlcuded in this package from Mill Creek, each of the 12 discs are double sided.One film is presented twice (The Pick Up), and two films that are said to be included in the collection are not (those are the films Carnival Of Crime and Lurkers), this adds the extra copy of The Pick Up and includes The French Quarter instead.Still, even with the mistake, it's quite the bargain, since these films are quite obscure.Many of them are Crown International Pictures.This IS what included in the collection:Drive-In Cult Classics - 8 Movie SetDrive-In Cult Classics, Vol. 2Drive-In Cult Classics: Volume ThreeAfter Dark ThrillersPS, Carvival Of Crime and Lurkers are found on this collection:Cult Terror Cinema (12 Movie Collection)which is also a great collection from Mill Cfreek."
3,SAVE IT FOR THE LARGER COLLECTION,I DIDNT LOOK FIRST .. MY FAULT GO GET THE 30 MOVIE COLLECTION BECAUSE THESE are IN THAT ONE TOO SO NOW I HAVE TWO SETS WITH THE SAME SET OF MOVIES ..THEY ARE b movies SO WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY ..LOL..
2,Drive-In Classic 32,"It was awesome, considering the quantity of movies I got in this packet. But most of the movies didn't worth the time I spent watching them. For a while I was wondering why they even made these DVD s?"
4,"Well done, a little dissapointed","This book is well done, very flow-charty with branches of what possible things can happen and how to handle them in any given situation. I was a touch dissapointed - just that I thought it would be more concept oriented. The CD is worth getting the book I suppose, since you can just keep that handy and refer to it as needed. Neutral feelings on this."
2,big daddy,Big daddy is ok it don`t have that rock sound like some of his older stuff.I give it two star. there are 3 song`s that i like the rest of them are to slow.I LIKE THAT FAST ROCK SOUND. But still a good price for this cd. thank you.
5,Ghost Hunt,We bought this for a grandaughter for Christmas who loves to be scared. This did not disappoint her.Next season will be on the list.
4,nyc piano pop electronica,Great pop record- reminds me of early Elton John mixed with new wave mixed with electronica. If you like catchy melodies and fun lyrics you will like this record.
5,I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!,"I saw this CD in iTunes and then heard ""Take Your Mama"" on MTV. I immediatly loved the CD. So, I bought it and that was the best thing i have ever done in my life!!!!! This album mixes techno with acoustic guitars and amzing lyrics, along melodic piano tunes. The best song on the CD, in my opinion, is ""T*ts On The Radio"" followed by ""Music Is The Victim"" and then ""Filthy/Gorgeous"". I also love ""Return To Oz"" because it is so different from the other songs on the CD. ""Comfortably Numb"" is a remake of a song by some old rock band...maybe Pink Floyd or The Who. Its one of the two.THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING!!!!!!BUY IT OR DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Astounding!,"There's no words to explain how amazing this album is! I can't even explain why I like it...it's different than most things I listen to, but it's incredible!! They're simply the best. I can't stop playing this album!"
3,It could've been better,"I got this album because the first single was stuck in my head for a whole weekend. I didn't seriously think I'd have to go to four different stores before I finaly found the cd.Anyway, the album is good for the first few tracks and the last few tracks. Mary, and It Can't Come Quckly Enough always make me feel sad, which is good b/c I like music that makes me feeling emotion. The only tracks I wouldn't reccomend on the disc are.... 5 through 7. Those songs do absolutly nothing for me me - so I've never taken the time to remember the names of them. Also, the group sounds too much like the Bee Gee's on those songs - it gives an unnatural feeling."
1,There is good reason why these ugly dragons are hated Stateside,"Blue Racer: Say Beetle, I mean who wants to hear a bunch of drag queens called Scissor Sisters. Japanese Beetle: Not us Japanese people nor our friends in North America where it only sold 100,000 copies. The album went 10 times Platinum in the UK meaning it sold 2.5 million copies there(a Platinu malbum means 250,000 copies had to be sold) but in America it TANKED rightfully Blue Racer: What sickens me than eating contaminated mice is that these drag-queens covered Pink Floyd's classic Comfortably Numb and wussified it into a disco song. Japanese Beetle: I think someone forgot to tell the praisers of this record that Disco died in 1979. The Blue Racer: The Comfortably Numb cover is as bad as those chimpanzees Brownstone who destroyed The Eagles' I Can't Tell You Why. Japanese Beetle: Haasah(chops cover in half), avoid please. SAYONARA!"
1,Zero Stars if possible.,"This is one of the worst CDs I've ever heard. Not only do they DESTROY a Pink Floyd song, but they are just more NME hyped crap.To the people who bought this crap: You are supporting an evil that should be put out of existance. The only way I could see anyone liking this is if they were also fans of Cher."
2,"My God, a Survivor ripoff band!","I half expected ""Eye of the Tiger"" to follow some of the intro strings. Music execs have got to get over this 80s retro thing, its just painful."
1,terrible,"HELLO LOSERSthis cd is a dud,does music get any worse than this NO,NOT AT ALL.IS THERE ANTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS CD,NO ABSOLUTELY NOT.please dont waste your money on this awful cd.there is better music out there.DONT BUY THIS CD.adios BOBBY BROWN."
4,Well...,"Can you say ""fruity?"" With the exception of ""Comfortably Numb"" (very lame) this album is very entertaining. I hope the lead singer gave his entire paycheck to Elton John--I mean, is he going to wear crazy wigs and outfits on stage, too?"
2,Shear Fudge,"When I first heard the name of this band, I thought they were some demented beautician take-off of Twisted Sister. I may have been wrong about that, but definitely not wrong about the 'sister' part. Their self-title debut album is full of songs that give contrasting emotions that make me want to dance one minute and resort to self-mutilation the next. And when one song can do that, you know it's gold. (Just like the gold lame pants the 'sister' lead singer wore on the SNL performance.) And if their own songs weren't genius enough, Scissor Sisters had the audacity to cover Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" - the result sounding like screeching cats stuck in a garbage disposal. I look forward to their next album, if there is enough skin surface left for me to abuse."
2,"OVER-RATED, OVER-HYPED","My best friend called me the other day raving about this disc and insisted that I go out and buy a copy. ""It's FABULOUS!"" he squealed. Reviewers ( both here and in various magazines ) also sang the praises of this album. I had heard their cover of Comfortably Numb in a nightclub and thought it was just ""OK"" ( I'm not a fan of disco-fied covers of old rock songs...they tell me the artist in question doesn't have a lot to offer, especially considering this is their first CD .) What I really liked is the song ""It Can't Come Quickly Enough"" which is on the Party Monster soundtrack. Moody, melodic, and just groovy enough. THAT'S what I was expecting this album to sound like. Was I ever wrong. Most of it sounds like something you'd hear on AM radio circa 1972 - in and of itself not such a bad thing, but here I JUST DON'T GET IT. Besides ""It Can't Come Quickly Enough"" and the Elton John-ish ""Take Your Mama"", the remainder of the album is just too light weight for my taste."
3,Mediocre,"One of a stack of CD's I borrowed from a co-worker, this is the album I truly expected to hate. After I listened to it, I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. Scissor Sisters are sort of like a kitschy Elton John disco band. It is interesting on the first listen, but I can see it getting old on repeated listens. I'm a big Pink Floyd fan, but apparently I'm not so much of a purist that I didn't get a hearty chuckle out of the Bee Gee's vocalized, ""Edge of Seventeen"" sampling, disco-sounding ""Comfortably Numb"". Still, this band is destined to be a 30 second segment on flash in the pan bands in a future VH-1 ""I love the 00's"" special."
2,AMERICA THE BEST COUTRY IN THE WORLD?,".... YEAH!!!!!! RIGHT!!!!!This album maybe terrible, but it still wipes the floor with the Eagles!"
1,Only large doeses of Prozac,"could make you like this deplorable screeching. Has the general population become so devoid of intelligence that they can't recoginze COMPLETE GARBAGE anymore?!!? Anyone who enjoys this music must be on powerful mental drugs, or they are just mindless cattle following the others who say they like this trash. They couldn't even get the lyrics correct for Comfortably Numb! Morons! Whoever signed this band should be fired and blacklisted from the music industry. Pink Floyd should sue the band into oblivion. If this talentless bunch can get a record contract, then so can everyone else! Where do I sign up? I wanna grab myself and yell about how I hate squaking faries. That should get me a record deal! (not that I do, I'm just stating this to make a point) This band makes the BeeGees look like the Beatles."
1,Really bad!,"This has to be one of the worst albums to be put out in years. I'm not going to jump on the whole I hate disco bandwagon, however I will say when you take a classic song like Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb and redo it, then you better do it well. I am very disappointed in the ear torturing sound that song represents to them and the lack of creativity it takes to butcher it like that. The rest of the album pretty much drags on bad musicianship and overall lack of lyrical depth. Do yourself a favor 1. Don't buy this album and 2. If you happen to see the lead singer in concert or on the street punch him in the nose from a horrified Pink Floyd Fan."
1,"Yeah, get this cd now...........",...if you're having trouble with birds in your garden. It should work as well as or better than an aol disc to scare them off. Anyone who calls this band talented may be interested in some swampland I have for sale. I'd rather hear Yoko Ono.
2,"Geez, are you all crazy???","As Dick Enberg says, ""Oh my!"" What a letdown. If you don't believe me, listen to their horrific cover of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb, one of the most celebrated rock songs of all time. The song evokes the image of the Bee Gees on crack. The disco references in their music are embarrassing. Maybe I'm missing the point, and the whole thing is a joke. But until I find this CD in the comedy section, everyone stay clear."
5,First album to inspire a review from me,"I'll start by saying my musical tastes range from ABBA to Rob Zombie and yet this is the first CD to inspire a review from me EVER! Yes you won't be able to listen and not compare to Elton John or the BeeGee's, but I'm not particular fans of either. However, this is taking the best of their 70's pop/rock and adding a beat actual FORCES you to move to the music. It was something I stumbled across and listened to on the net in full and was just amazed. I'm not fan of today's club music...and as ""gay disco"" as some will describe this to be...it is EXACTLY what would get me to walk into a club again and enjoy. SHOCKINGLY INCREDIBLE is all I can say...a must listen. You will most likely HATE or RUN to the store to purchase...enjoy!"
4,Hedwig and The Angry Inch PART II,"Think 70's Elton John, think 70's David Bowie, think rock, think pop, think electronica, think dance, think 'Hedwig and The Angry Inch' (this is SO like it I had to check the credits for writing credits) but ultimately think FUN!!A really enjoyable album, which has more substance than I expected it to (I thought they were a novelty group) mainly up-tempo, with a couple of strong ballads.This UK edition comes with 2 strong bonus tracks - which complement the cd perfectly.My personal favourite tracks are Laura, Take Your Mama Out, Filthy/Gorgeous, and Return To Oz."
4,Pretty cool music,"Good beats, good vocals, cool, catchy tunes...seems like that right combination is harder and harder to come by these days. This group sounds like a combination of White Town, Elton John, and Fleetwood Mac, all without sounding like a copycat. Thumbs up!"
1,I couldn't agree more with Zero Stars guy below,"I can't believe Amazon actually e-mailed me this promotion and said people who like Franz Ferdinand bought this album. I'm beginning to wonder about the integrity of both this site and these reviews.And yes, David Gilmour should sue.By the way Zero Stars Guy...for living in a small town with less idiots, I'd learn to spell better before criticizing others...or risk getting kicked out of that town.And for those of you who believe our party affiliation somehow influences our taste in music, you must be a Democrat with some kind of social axe to grind. Take it from another Democrat...quit whining. You're giving the party a bad name."
1,What a joke!,"I can't believe that anyone could take a classic song such as Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" and make it garbage.Do not waste your hard earned cash for trash!"
1,Roger Waters Should Sue,"The only thing more unbearable than listening to this garbage is watching this ""band"" perform. Comfortably Numb is one of the most amazing songs ever written, and what Scissor Sisters has done to it should be punishable by a lifetime banishment from the music-recording industry. Composing and performing their own truly awful songs would have been bad enough. Tampering with the work of a band that was, perhaps, the most creative, original and qualitatively superior of the 20th century is far, far worse."
1,disgusting,i can't believe anybody could do this to Pink Floyd. who could have possibly given them the permission. i hope they get sued. if i ever regretted not being married to a milionier it's now - i would have bought every single copy of this travesty and destroyed it for the sake of good taste and the future generations. there should be 0 star rating just for this crap.
1,Abominable!,This group doesn't deserve any of the hype it has been given. And to think I trusted the fact that the B-52s chose them to open for them on their recent tour! A helium-voiced lead singer and silly disco music adds up to an annoying experience. Fans of Pink Floyd beware - the Sisters' version of Comfortably Numb will drive you to jump off a cliff. Probably the worst CD of the year. Ugh!
4,DIFFERENT,"(...) Anyway, enough of my rambling, here's the review.Although I didn't grow up in the Disco era, I don't mind SOME Disco although I'm not generally a fan of 'dancing music' - trance, house.etc is definately not my cup of tea. But although the Scissors Sisters' debut draws heavily from all of those genres and more, it also combines more 'tradition' song elements adding a healthy dose of mid-90s Gorillaz/Regurgitator style fusion, with a bit of 70s glam.I actually only bought the album yesterday so as often happens I need to get listen to the songs more before I get used to them, but so far the picture is overall positive. 'Take Your Mamma', 'Laura' and 'Return to Oz' stand out with their infectious beats, falsetto vocals (except the latter) just the right degree of computer-generated sound effects. The production, etc is very good (necessary for this kind of album). Overall, this is one of the more truly original groups atm that doesn't try to copy others, so is definately worth a look."
2,"""a day of authentic retro-rock""?","If your idea of ""a day of authentic retro-rock"" is wholesale style piracy, then, yes, this is ""a day of authentic retro-rock."" I wanted to love this CD. I tried to love this CD. I cried myself to sleep at night, praying that somewhere in my soul I had the capacity to adore this group of fashionistas from NYC with the ironic hair and ""I'm smarter than everyone and no, the suit-jacket-with-jeans-look-is-not-unoriginal-and-tired"" air. I did my best. But in the end, after 5 listens this disc becomes a novelty album that, unfortunately, is most likely destined to become an artifact of a day of authentic retro-stagnation."
3,comfortably brilliant!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't care too much for this CD which sounds rather mediocre to me but the version of Comfortably numb they did is COMPLETELY FANTASTIC, such a smasher.Pick up this CD cheap and put Comfortably numb on repeat. It totally kicks butt~!John"
4,Disco-Rock...This is new,"The Scissor Sister have broken a sound barrier with this album. This CD has a disco-funk-modern rock sound, which is definatly something you dont hear every day, and is definatly something we need more of. Being typically more into the hard rock thing, I did not initially associate them with the Bee-Gees or the Pet Shop Boys. My first thought was, instead, that they were more a disco-ish version of Twisted Sister. But in any case, they rock, this CD rocks, and their music is definatly something to dance to."
5,"Pop genius, quality fluff with a heart and a brain","Sure it's fluff, but this album grows on you. It's candy-coated pop, but the lyrics are great. And the amazing thing is...they sound better LIVE than on the CD--they're a real rock-pop band like the B-52s or Roxy Music. The guitarists and drummer are TIGHT. Comfortably Numb is cute, yeah, but other songs like Is this the Return to Oz? and Filthy Gorgeous really stand out. The single Laura is just a dumb record company pick, for easy radio play. It's their live performances and genuine-ness that will see this group thru anything they want to do. Plus they're just a bunch of samrt-ass down-to-earth New York slut-bunnies, you gotta love that."
3,Worth hearing,"The influences (BeeGees, Elton John, rave-era before pushing as many beats as possible) can be nearly overwhelming but if you're going to ape your influences, at least they do it well. Some of the tracks, ""Take Your Mama Out"", ""Filthy, Gorgeous"", ""Laura"" are strong enough to work off the dance floor.There's absolutely no excuse for the dire cover of ""Comfortably Numb"", which ignores both the famous guitar solo and the floating dread of the song. You can skip one or the other but not both. Maybe it works for late night club kids, tired, doses fading, but I'm too old for that: all I hear is a K-tel release. BeeGees Cover Pink Floyd! Special Budget price! Special bundle with Disco Superman Soundtrack!There's nothing on the album with a fresh sound--""Return to Oz"" is strong but may as well be a Stardust era Bowie outtake--but these guys are obviously talented."
1,they should use it at gitmo,Scissor sisters debut album is really horrible.they should make use of it to torture inmates at gitmo.dont buy it.there are better bands which make better music.
1,a really lousy album,Scissor sisters album is a horrible joke on the people who have bought it.I was apalled after listening to this garbage at a friends place.it is truly horrible .avoid it if you can.get any album from UFO or DIO instead.
1,terrible and disgraceful,"scissor sisters debut cd is one of the worst cd's i listened to.the comfortably numb cover version was bad and moronic.it is well known that such lousy music is bad for healthcoz floydian expert says so.the who,megadeth and motorhead are much better.no stars."
4,Intriguing story,"Fascinating story line with an emotional roller coaster woven through from beginning to end, would recommend to anyone who has enjoyed reading Wlbur Smith before."
5,Excellent,Wilbur does it again! Great read! Takes unexpected turns just like the Mirage David piloted in the book. Just what you expect from Smith.
5,Challenges faced that one cannot change.,"From beginning to end, an epic journey. I loved the moving around the world, the time in Israel, the excitement of being part of the air force. The sorrows faced where strong love will only help if the people involved are prepared to give was well done. The time in Africa a healing time and yet........ I think this was one of Wilbur Smith's best books that he wrote."
5,Exciting and Unpredictable from Cover to Cover,"I love all of Wilbur Smith books. This was exceptional. I could not put this book down. When halfway through all the drama that I thought possible had taken place. I really wondered what he could possibly put into the story to keep this book alive for 200 more pages?Well he did. Brilliantly wove in two or three more cleverly disquised and conceived plots. The surprise and suspense continued until the last page was written.A thoroughly enjoyable book featuring a great balance of action, courage, loyalty and love. You will not be disappointed in reading it."
5,One of his best yet!,"I've read most of his novels, and while I haven't loved all of them, this one is without a doubt one of the best. I couldn't put it down!"
2,Stopped reading,This story started out ok. I was interested partly because I was a pilot for over 30 years. As it progressed the book became a story about a 14 year old that grew to be a rich playboy jerk who was directionless and so indulgent.
2,Eagle in the Sky,"I am typically a fan of Wilbur Smith and have enjoyed many of his works. That enjoyment did not include ""Eagle in the Sky."" I waited about 50 pages into this work before I concluded that I must have picked up one of my wife's romance novels by mistake. That might even be unfair to my wife's favorite genre. In her selections at least the sex is interesting. If Wilbur needs some cash why doesn't he do like his contemporaries and hire somebody to write something interesting for him."
4,"Review ""Eagle in the Sky""",I finished reading this book in the second week of Dec 12. The book was a good story and an enjoyable read.
3,"Okay, Just Okay","This is essentially a romance -- a chick book. I dunno -- I didn't find it exciting. The dialog seemed strained. The book just abruptly hopped from scenario to scenario with little nuance or development. This was my first Wilbur Smith book and I might try another one, but this was just an average read."
3,A Wilbur Fan,"I am a great fan of Wilbur Smith and have even met him in Zambia in the late 80's. This is not one of his best books. I do not know why his quality of writing has dropped. The book is entertaining, but I expect a great deal from his literary ability; this one missed the mark."
4,This is a Gem,"This book makes you believe that love is beautifull. I could read it again and again. David is strong and faithfull to Deborah whose love is great. Never a boring moment, full of adventure and fantastic modern incite into their culture."
3,"Good, light read","I have read all of Wilbur Smith's books. There was not as much to this book as the others. It was a pleasant, romantic story, but I usually like a little more intrigue in my novels."
2,This book is alright.,"This book was alright. This book shows some of the conflict Isreal faced in the past, border disputes. This is mostly a love story, more so than the average Smith book. I recommend this book to my Jewish friends."
5,The Best,"All you negative people, wish you had just a 1/2 of 1 percent of 1 percent of the income from this soudtrack. jealousy abounds......Money talks louder than any of you ever will........"
3,ok,"Well, this was really THE BIG THING last year, but they played it WAY too much, and then it got really boring. I really enjoyed the actual MUSIC in it, the traditional part of it. It really reminded me of all the people who were lost on the Titanic, or who lost someone. The music seemed to fit with the actual tradegy."
3,Very Good Elevater Music.,"Yes, the Ship Sank, but this CD will NOT follow it easily. If you are The-movie-was-a-really-masterpiece-fan, buy this. There are so many that kind of fans in this world. But I would not recommend this to the one of my friend (He is a very particular in buying soundtrack). SO BUY THIS ON YOUR OWN RISK."
5,"Wow, this was captivating!","This Titanic soundtrack cd was absolutely by far one of the best purchases I have ever made. The entire cd is completely captivating, making you feel like you are actually watching the movie and you can depict specific scenes right out of the music! I must say that James Horner did an exquisite job and this is by far his best work I've seen out of him. I would most definately recommend this soundtrack even if you have never seen the famous ""Titanic""."
4,Where is my happy music?,"I must say that this CD contains high-quality, symphonic orchestra level music. It contains all the magical nautical themes and pipe melodies that I love in Celtic music. No doubt.However, when I bought it I was more interested in finding the music played in the ""economy class"" section of the ship. I was disappointed not to get it and have not been able to obtain it anywhere. May be the producers of Titanic (movie and/or CD) should consider publishing a CD with that music."
5,A perfect marriage of movie and music!,"My impressions of the movie are both good and bad: masterful execution and presentation of an at-best-mediocre love story, which detracts from an otherwise terrific work. However, James Horner's score underpins all of the good things about the picture, adding the right emotional touches to most of the memorable scenes, especially as the movie goes from the joys of the voyage to the horrors and tragedies of the sinking.Although it is a paradoxical juxtaposition to use synthesizers and other effects in a 1912 movie setting, it really works. The cominbation of electronics with classical instrumentation results in a mix that is varied in content, yet completely coherent in style and feel. A true masterpiece!Normally, If I like the movie, its soundtrack album is less than stellar, or vice-versa. ""Titanic"" is one of the few exceptions, and probably the best movie/soundtrack duo since John Williams' score for the ""Star Wars"" trilogy."
5,A Tearjerker,"""Titanic"" is a real tearjerker as is the soundtrack. The music is beautiful! Usually I hate soundtracks that just play music, no lyrics at all. This soundtrack is different because whenever I listen to it, I visulize the scenes in my mind. My favorite song on the CD is ""Rose"" because my fave scene is when Jack and Rose are on the bow of the ship together and they kiss. The music is beautiful and it reminds me of that scene. James Horner is a great composer and James Cameron did a great job directing the movie. ""Titanic"" is my favorite movie of all time and my favorite CDs are Back to Titanic, Titanic and My Name is JOE by Joe. I've probably seen the movie more than ten times (I've had it since I was 14), and I still cry every time! The movie and soundtracks are great! :)"
2,Space for improvement,"On the total, the tunes are able to capture your feelings well. furthermore, I can reminise the movie screens when listening to this CD. Especially Celine's ""My heart will go on"" is a big hit in Singapore. Her voice is real powerful."
5,The best I have ever heard,If you have ever seen the movie then listen to the soundtrack you can picture everything that is going on. Its like seeing the movie over and over again END
4,This is a great CD,"I thought that this was a great cd but it has gotten old. To anyone who is thinking about buying it, if you don't like music without words, don't buy it. The only song with words is My heart will go on. Otherwise I thought it was a great CD to relax to."
5,White Star Line,This heart breaking cd is wonderful! Each tearbreaking song filled my heart with greath. Titanic is my all time favorite movie!My favorite song is hum to the sea.You have got to buy the cd.I still can't belive that Titanic won eleven oscers.
2,Highly Overrated.,"Even though I'm a fan of Horner's music, this one didn't strike me at all. IMO, the only listenable music is after the ship sinks. The vocals are quite good, but I don't think that should've give it the Oscar. They probably thought since Titanic had won practically everything else, why not give it Best Score, too. Something that might have saved it, however, would be the lack of a synthesized choir. It is a good thing that Dion's song only appeared once, though. All in all, this score (I repeat SCORE for those of you who only bought the CD for that gravy train song.) is pretty much uninteresting. If you buy any James Horner CD, make sure it's WILLOW. It's kinda hard to find, but can be purchased at AMAZON for a very inexpensive price. And believe me, it's worth a lot more than the money you spend on Titanic."
3,My stereo will go on,"Maybe I've expected from this score too much. Without dramatic pictures and visual atmosphere is the music just a shadow of the great epic story. One well-known melody and that's all. And maybe I've expected from this SACD too much. The rear channels are not enough dynamic, it's like a stereo sound remastered to 5.1 sound (It's a hybrid SACD - stereo and surround sound)... I think, here is a classical stereo sound enough."
3,I'm tired of that overplayed song!,"I'm sorry, Celine Dion, but I can't accept the fact that you'll sing that song, which has been played over a million times on the radio, for the rest of your life. Yeah it's a great song, but it's not the best song in my book. However, the orchestral music by James Horner works just fine."
1,My heart will go on makes me want to scream,"Not only have I heard that stupid Heart will go on piece of sh*t about a zillion times, I also don't like it because it is a really stupid song. Celine Dion has a terrible voice. I am amazed she ever made it this far. The rest of the soundtrack stunk too."
5,Titanic Music,"This track has a beautiful melody to it, which spells of love even if you have not seen the movie. There are aspects in which the music changes to a dramatic tone to accompany the movie's eventful dangerous aspects, but I think it adds variety to the soundtrack. You do not need to see the movie to truly enjoy the music. My husband went many months listening regularly to this music and thoroughly enjoyed - even before he saw the movie."
3,Not as good as i thought!!,"I firgured this cd would be awesome, truly amazing!! NOT!! This cd only has one song with words and i am a wordy kinda person!!"
4,Good soundtrack,"I didn't care for the movie too much but this soundtrack is surprisingly good. That song ""My Heart Will Go On"" is noteworthy because Celine Dion was the chick who immortalized it from the git-ko. Since this CD sold over 10 million copies in America obviously James Horner TRIED to do something right. Right now this is the only piece of his work I own, I'm not into movie soundtracks that much at all. I also think Sissel did an incredible vocal job but everything about this soundtrack is worth noting for the effort JH put into it."
4,Titanic is DEEP,"This was quite possibly the first time in history that music matched a movie with perfection. The music is sad, haunting and deep. James Horner knows music! Some parts of the soundtrack are boring. Other parts are really uplifting. This soundtrack brings so many emotions. If you haven't seen the movie then you CAN'T relate to the soundtrack. See the movie in order to appreciate this soundtrack. This soundtrack has to given it's props for the complexity. I give it 4 stars overall. However for the depth and perfect relation to the movie it would get 5 stars."
1,yucky,"I prefer listening to bagpipes and looking at men in skirts than this CD and this movie. Don't waste your money. Ugh - ""My Heart Will Go On"" - until I stop it with a machine gun. We've all heard this song a million times...who the heck wants to hear it again?"
1,This CD should have gone to the bottom with Titanic,"When James Horner goes to bed at night his prayers must sound like this, ""Please God, when I wake up, let me be John Williams."" But alas he awakens after a tortured night filled with nightmares of Tchaivosky, Beethoven, and Dvorak chasing him for the rights to his, their, music. It is only so long before the demons find Horner cutting and pasting his way to easy success again. Hey Jimmy Boy, you can't milk that Braveheart cow forever."
1,I think this CD is a waste of money,"The only reason that I bought this CD was because of ""My Heart Will Go on"". When I finally got home and put it in my CD player, I fell asleep the second the music started. It also began to annoy me. It's pretty much the same song over and over again. Even the song ""My heart will go on"" began to annoy me. That was all anyone heard on the radio for like 4 months. I'm never going to listen to this again, unless I want to be annoyed and/or fall asleep. Sorry if I'm not like the other millions of fans but, this CD stinks."
3,NAH!,"FOUR DISCS ARE NOT AS VALUABLE AS WE THOUGHT BEFORE, AND REMASTERED CDS IS NOT THAT BRILLANT WHEN I COMPARED THEM WITH THE ORIGINALALBUMS. THE FOURTH DISC IS A LITTLE POINTLESS, AND UNNECESSARY."
5,Perfect!!!,"This CD was worth every penny. It's almost as if it was meant for me. I love the score, classical music, and music from the 1910-1940s. It's so enjoyable to listen to. It also comes with some Titanic stickers that I adore because I am obsessed with the movie and the history of the Titanic."
4,haunting music,great music evokes your emotions horner is fantastic check out braveheart aliens etc... the only omission which cant be found anywhere is the movies opeming title scene whcih for some unknown reason isnt there. The music though truly has hear and soul and at times send chills down your spine
5,As Good as the Movie itself!,"The music creates a mood that captures the movie and the story - but it also is great for listening to as you sit writing on your computer, relax in your backyard on a summer day or sit in the front room by the fire on a cold winter night. It makes your mind reflect on your own life and is great for day dreaming. The music is soft and emotional and yet relaxing as well.If you loved the movie you will enjoy the music even more."
3,CD VERSION ISN'T THAT GREAT!,"BUT THE ONLY SONG I LIKE FROM THE MOVIE WHICH I SAW TWICE IS ""MY HEART WILL GO ON"" By: Celine Dion. I Really enjoyed the ""TITANIC"" movie!!!"
5,THIS SOUNDTRACK IS MAJESTIC AND BEAUTIFUL,"This soundtrack had the best music, I am 19 and I happen to adore classical music. The songs fit the movie scenes, and they did a great job. Each song was grand and lovely. You can almost picture the people on the real TITANIC while enjoying the music. I think that some people have falied to realize that the soundtrack was more than being about violins and flutes, the music was about life and souls lost in 1912."
3,OK - Not Great - Lots of good music from the movie is not on this CD,This is a pretty weak CD of the Titanic music. Lots of scores from the original movie are not included - so overall I was disappointed by it. It's sound is repetitious and a bid monotonic and boring. Love Celine and if you love her to then the CD maybe worth buying - otherwise look for a more complete CD.
2,"horner excellent, dion overwrought","while James Horner's music was fabulous(one of the best parts of the movie) celine is pathetic,whiny, overwrought. horner creates a near masterpiece and celine gets all the huzzahs for croaking out a dog"
4,"The cd was very good, but not the best CD in the world","I thought that this CD was very well made and I enjoyed listening to the music, because it brought the experience of watching the movie back. I actually cried when listening to 'The Death of Titanic'. The only fault was that the producers didn't include the steerage party-music."
5,The Music Is Great Fits Perfectly with the movie,"The Score to Titanic is very effective it shows pure emotion , some of the songs show a deep darkness, complete sadness and death like during The Sinking of Titanic. And also The happier upbeat tempos of the happier times on Titanic.All The Songs are great and i think its one of the best scores to a newer movie . Buy This soundtrack its great And Also buy Back To Titanic it has many of the other songs that were also good that were left off this soundtrack."
1,Nice To Fall Asleep To,"Just because you don't like classical music, dosn't mean that you won't like the TITANIC CD. Very nice to fall asleep to, nice for long trips. Check this CD out."
1,Thank God Titanic's time is past!,"This CD is like listening to the same music for an hour, with lots of ethereal angels whoo whooing in the background. And Celine Dion doesn't have a subtle bone in her body so she beats the hell out of her sappy ballad, showing off her vocal prowess but too lazy to look for meaning in the song. Throw this CD over the railing into the deep!"
3,"A horner score by all acounts, but not as good as others","I honestly feel this soundtrack won the academy award for best dramatic score because of the overrated movie itself and for the Celion Dion song. It isn't a bad score, but i don't know, it is clouded to me. I didn't enjoy the score tracks expect for track 15. And I always heard ""my heart will go on"" instead of the whole album. So, that isn't a good sign, lol. It is really something that Glory and Braveheart his much superior scores did not win the award and Titanic, an inferior score to an overrated movie did! I don't think this score/soundtrack deserved it and Horner's only Academy award for best score is tainted to me."
2,Overrated because of one hit single,"With the exception of ""My heart will go on"" by Celine Dion, Horner's soundtrack is not a masterpiece but a bunch of stinking skunks who are masked by a field of sweet smelling flowers.For a soundtrack score it is not riveting and really lacks any emotional connection to the film. Overall it is just really overrated and the hit single got played so much that the masses just fell into a typical zombie trance and went marching to the store to buy it. This was after they kept returning to the theater to see a fictional tale of love built around a tragic, awful event.It didn't stop them though; they could not get enough of seeing all those depictions of people freezing to death in the water. Overall a below average soundtrack that road the coat tails of a hit single that was shoved down our throats for an entire year."
1,0 stars is more like it,Stupid and boring background music. Hardly any fast parts. This cd is the worst soundtrack I own. For those looking for a real movie score check out Mask of Zorro or almost any other James Horner film music.
1,what a lousy cd,no one in their right mind should buy this cd. please go and use your money more wisely!!!
1,Not enough.,"The party seen in steerage with ""Galic Storm"" playing the Irish ""diddly-d"" music where Rose and Jack Danced togheter was one of the musical hightlights of the movie, yet was not included on the soundtrack. When I hear some of the songs that replaced it, I cant help but wonder who made that decision. I had to buy Gaelic Storm's CD to hear the song. I was pleasently suprised as the entire CD was fantastic, so this soundtrack [being] so bad, turned me onto another good one. I guess thats why it got at least 1 star."
1,"Horner is a good composer, but he bombed Titanic!","Although I am a big fan of Horner, this is one of the few scores he has written that I was absolutely dissapointed in. It sounds SO electronic, and has no trace of the orchestral sound the Horner is famous for. Even the voice choir often heard is enough to drive you crazy, and if you ask me, it would have sounded excellent had Horner used an actual orchestra and voice choir. This is merely my opinion, but Horner strayed way to far from his excellent orchestra style he used in ""The Rocketeer"" and ""Willow."" Don't get it."
3,disappointing music,"Most of the music on this cd feels & sounds very dark. I loved the Celine Dion piece & bits & parts of some others. This is not music I'd play for relaxation, enjoyment or entertainment purposes"
2,Relive the Movie by Memory,"I was somewhat disappointed that the CD was predominantly instrumental, but on the other hand as one listened, the music moved you emotionally through each scene of the movie. A strange and different way to experience the ""Titanic"" movie."
1,IT'S SINKING!,"This is a great CD if you are really into buying soundtracks of movies that create a false sense of meaning in your life or if you live through movies insted of the real world. And Celine Dion?? I could barely listen to the song the first time I heard it. Now it's really annoying, just like any other song they over-overplay on the radio, on television, and at weddings. Help! I'm stuck in the mainstream nothingness! repeat repeat repeat"
5,The one CD for everyone's collection,"Before seeing the movie, I glanced at the cd in the store. After i saw the film, there was no way I couldn't have it. Wonderful music to fall asleep to. The first time you hear the music after seeing the movie, it's very hard to keep yourself from crying. I couldn't! ""My Heart Will Go On"" is definitely one of the most memorable movie themes ever. BUY THIS CD!!! END"
4,I think that the CD gives a very nice feeling of the movie.,This soundtrack gives you alot of the feeling from the movie. It shows the different types of emotions running through the people from the time that the ship took off to the time that the ship completely sunk. The movie was very well put together and the CD was an extra that put it all together and made this effort a sucess!!!
3,"The movie was better, but this is OK","When I bought this CD I expected it would have a lot of cool songs. But it only has one song with lyrics, (My Heart Will Go On--a really good song) but you get sick of it after a while. The rest of the music captivates the spooky, thrilling essence of the movie, but it still doesn't seem to be very entertaining. I think that if you want to hear ""My heart will go on"", you should get a single of it, or Celine Dion's CD (which has it too). Otherwise, just watch the movie. It is much better."
5,This CD is worth buying!!!!,"This CD is cool.And for the people who don't like it is because they're wild stupid brats that don't know what there talking about.Maybe the reason why they don't like it is because they don't understand music. This is thinking music, not dancing or parting. If you want to dance listen to rap, alternative, or slow music."
5,Beautiful!!!,"I don't know why people keep dissing htis cd, it is haunting and make me cry. I guess everyone has their own opinion though. I thought the movie and this cd were wonderful and beautiful and everyone should buy it!!! Also, all the songs are not the same they are all very different but all are lovely!!!!!"
5,"Hauntingly, Soulfully Beautiful","/this music has a very spiritual, other-worldly quality. Just as the Titanic and her story has many quasi-supernatural qualities about it, this exquisite and majestic score has a very spiritual quality; it stirs our very essence. This entire event is forever embroidered on humanity. We will always be enraptured by Titanic and the Edwardian age that abruptly ended with her loss."
3,"Pleasant album, marred by too much & too little","This album works well as a reminder of the film. On first listening, the tracks seemed to repeat each other, but further listenings reveal the small differences between them. I was disappointed that the music from the party in Steerage was left off. Over all, the music is magnificent, capturing the feel of the period well, but I think the album would have been improved by replacing a theme track (or 2) with music from the party."
5,A VERY GOOD CD. IT'S THE BOMB.,TITANIC CD IS A VERY GOOD CD. THE BEST SONG IS MY HEART WILL GO ON. PEOPLE THINK TITANIC IS A STUPID CD BECAUSE ONLY ONE SONG HAS WORDS. BUT IF YOUV'E SEEN THE MOVIE YOU WOULD THINK THE SONGS WITH NO WORDS ARE STILL PRETTY GOOD SONGS BECAUSE THEY ARE PLAYED IN SAD PARTS OF THE MOVIE. THEY SHOULD OF PUT THE STEERAGE MUSIC ON THE CD. THE STERRAGE MUSIC IS WIN JACK AND KATE GO TO A POOR PEOPLE PARTY(NO OFFENSE)
5,Fantastic and one of a kind,"This is the best movie soundtrack I have ever heard. Considering the fact that the majority of the soundtrack is instrumental, it's odd for someone like me to be so drawn to it. If you have seen the movie, the music will grip you intensly emotionally. Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" is a fantastic song, and obviously others agree, being that it's the Golden Globe winning and Acadamy Award nominated song. Don't overlook this incredible musical creation. END"
3,The boat sank: Get over it.,"The movie could use a little help. (Well, maybe quite a bit.) But the soundtrack is good. The only real problem I have with C.d is the fact that ""My heart will go on."" has been played so many times it gets ANOYING!!!!!!"
3,"James Horner good, Celine Dion bad....","It takes no amount of exaggeration to say that James Horner is the best at what he does, (except for John Williams) but the overplayed Celine Dion songs drags this CD down. If you like James Horner's music, try Braveheart. Much better movie, much better music."
3,"Wasn't this music and style ""borrowed"" from Enya?","When I heard the music from Titanic, I was certain that the soundtrack contained several songs from the artist Enya. I was shocked that the Titanic soundtrack was supposedly composed by someone else. Compare ""Southampton"" from the Titanic soundtrack and ""Book of Days"" from the CD ""Sheperd Moons"" by Enya. Either that tune is public domain or somebody is stealing. I enjoyed the peacefulness of the music and felt that it truly added to the film. I was only disappointed to find out that James Horner had (it seemed to me) copied someone else's music and style as his own. Please correct me if I am wrong!"
4,A sheer masterpiece,"I'd have to say that out of all of Titanic's Oscar-winning catergories, the music would probably have to be my favorite. It expresses all of the performed emotions in the film rather splendidly.My one and only complaint would have to be that the selected music on the cd can feel sparse at times. But I still highly recommend it."
5,Captures the essence of the film!,"Horner can do miracles with music. He can show the grandeur of the Titanic about to cast off to the sadness of the ship sinking and love, emotion between two characters.Horner is indeed a master of music. This soundtrack is one of the best ever composed by Horner.Horner uses classical music and some Irish/Galic/Celtic/German tunes and rolls them in to music. He also uses his choir to a great affect.Listen to this soundtrack and take a once in a life time voyage aboard the RMS Titanic."
2,PLEASE STOP CELINE & SISSEL FROM SINGING!,"ALRIGHT. THE MOVIE STUNKBECAUSE- BAD SCRIPT- MISPORTRAYALS OF REAL PEOPLE WHO DIED LIKE HEROS- MORONIC LOVE STORY- BAD SCRIPT- LEO AND KATE- CAMERON- AND ALL THE CRAP! The soundtrack was 4 stars when I first listened to it... then it got on my nerves with ""My Heart Will Go On"" and other no brainer songs...my favorite song of the whole sountrack was ""TAKE HER TO SEA MR. MURDOCH"" because it is a fresh new song, not the same melodies used over and OVER again. Also because I thought that WAS THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE DURING THAT SONG. (ENGINE ROOM PART COUNTS ALSO!) THIS is why I gave it a 2 star rating. There's NO way i'm going to buy into that crap BACK TO TITANIC, with the quality from the first I wouldn't expect number two (produced in weeks so they could make more money off of us) to be ANY BETTER! Sorry TITANIC people AND LOVERS, start reading and seeing movies about THE REAL TITANIC DISASTER...REAL PEOPLE DIED!"
2,Opposing viewpoint in a big way,"Well, in the face of all these 10s Ijust have to chime in with a dissenting opinion. Frankly, I thinkthe soundtrack is pure unadulteratedcrap. Bad writing, bad synthesizervoices, but what else is new fromHorner? But this is a typical reaction when people fall in love witha film. Happened with Somewhere InTime, happened with Out Of Africa, only the big difference is that thosefilms had good scores by John Barry.But, who am I to argue with the numberone selling album in the country?!Just goes to show you. END"
2,It's not to good,"This soundtrack doesn't have anything interesting in it. There is only one song with lyrics and the rest is like a bunch of orchestra instruments. It can be relaxing if you're trying to fall asleep or rest a bit, but it's nothing I would just turn on to listen to."
1,Horner =Mediocrity Incarnate,"Of all the music on this cd the only thing that stands out is ""Hymn to the Sea"".The rest is the usual cinematic fluff that any composer can throw together by the albumload.And that Celine Dion song-I thought she was getting her throat slit!Please don't waste your money on this nothing of an album.There are countless great recordings out there,and this isn't one of them."
1,Do not buy this c-d!,Who would put boring backround music on a cd? I am so sick of My Heart Will Go On and having to listen to it on the radio. It may look like a good cd but it's not! Don't waste your money on listening to the music that was played when people were getting on the Titanic.
1,My advice is NOT TO GET THIS CD it is boring.,I bought the cd and when I listened to it it was boring. I bought it because I liked My Heart Will Go On. When I listened to My Heart Will Go On it sounded totaly different than what was on the radio. I WOULD NOT get this cd it is not worth all the money.
2,American losers you know nothing,"Look, you American losers, why don't you just get a grip. This really isn't the best book EVER. Evidently you forget that England has the richest history of literature in the world - maybe some of you should read something worthwhile. END"
3,"I wish Andrea Bocelli had sung ""My Heart Will Go On.""","I'm sorry. ""Titanic"" was too darned long ago, as was this zillion-selling soundtrack. Celine Dion's ""Let's Talk About Love"" was a MONSTER hit because of the song ""My Heart Will Go On."" I've been reading reviews by people who say Celine can't sing and who yells out the lyrics. No offense. Celine DOES have a somewhat screechy voice sometimes, but on the whole, while she's no longer my favorite singer, I don't think she's THAT horrible. She probably just felt the power of the songs she performs, and her truly passion-filled voice allowed her to do so (and sell almost 100 million albums globally in the past few years). And no offense to the song, either: Sarah Brightman re-recorded the song in Italian on her ""Eden"" album, and it is a good song. It just isn't the best song in the world, even if the whole world has heard it a zillion times. I just wish Andrea Bocelli (who sang with Celine in 1998) would attempt the song, now."
1,Pure and Simple Crap,"Titanic has a vaguely movin theme, played some many times I want to murder Celine Dion. Horner overuses, overuses, and, hmmmmm, overuses some more the moronic theme. Don't get me wrong, I love Horner's other scores, but this one isn't worth my fat butt.(Please excuse me, but I believe that statement to be TRUE!!) Not even worth getting this for free. STAY AWAY FROM TITANIC!!! What in God's name was the Academy thinking win they gave Horner the Oscar???? If I EVER hear the totally butt-holed song-'My Heart Will Go On', MY heart won't go on anymore!"
1,Image 10.0 treadmill- noisy!,"This is a very noisy treadmill. So noisy, that I'm giving mine away. I could just have a lemon, and others may be betters, but this one is noisy!"
5,Great,its a good seaseon witha great ending but as ive stated in a review for another part of the this series laern how to wath it subbed the japanes voice acting is done alittle better with the english one.
5,season 3 with a epic tournament finale,"This season is all about the anticipated fight between Toguro and Yuske. It was a pretty decent fight this show sort of reminds me of DBZ with yuske being goke and Hiea being vegeta. but this is a great season in a great show. this maybe in the top anime. DBZ,One Piece, naruto shippuiden, bleach, full metal alchemist/brotherhood, yu yu hakusho, soul eater, in this order."
4,Solid if this is your thing,"I bought the whole series of Yu Yu Hakusho because it is a solid anime show. It starts a bit slow introducing all the characters and personalities but once it hit episode 10 it really starts to take off. I'm not a big anime guy and I've been watching this show since I was younger when it was on tv so if your into the anime that is targeted towards teens then your golden, if not this may not be the show for you"
3,The dark tournament ends,The story is a little slow after the tournament is over.However there is some excitement.yuske is kidnapped by 3 humans and demons are close to having full access to human world.This season prepares the way for yuseke to become even more powerful.
1,Item not receive.,I order this Item and for the first time ever a product never got to me. I am very unhappy with amazon. it is sad because I was a big fan.
4,Good historical reading,"At the time this book was originally written (1830), the Northwest was the upper Missisippi Valley. I originally read this book because the author had lived among the Native American Indians and knew their culture. This was before the true nature of the European White man had become evident to the Indians and the Indians treated the White man as equals. But, in his introduction, even though he blasts other authors for their shallow representation of the Indian, he automatically assumes the Indians are not as good as White people and treats them as such in the book. Frequently though, the Indian looks more honorable than the White man in the ten stories. Despite the author's bias, a picture of the Indian's culture does come through. A good read for Indian and White culture at the time"
4,"Recovering from a death, a woman learns her ultimate destiny","A woman is recovering from her boyfriend, Jerry's, death, after they had snuck into their school to count the homecoming queen ballots. She begins to have strange visions, along with dreaming of a story about ancient Egypt. She meets a man named Tom, who shows her that she holds great power, which she uses to bring her lover back from the dead, at the cost of her own. I thought that most of this was sort of silly, like when the man at the theatre related to the girl his own supernatural experiences"
4,Punishment,"A Review by CJWhen Merry lost her boyfriend, she was in a serious panic. Will she ever live through this, will she find a way out.This book was fun to read. The characters were great and funny. You would always want to find what would be next when you read at least one chapter. This book will bring you a lot of laughter once you get in to it.I would recommend this book to people who like horror and adventure."
3,The Visitor - Christopher Pike,"A story of many lifes told through the eyes of Mary, a teenager, distrought over her boyfriends death. Mary and Jerry decide to see who will win for homecoming queen when something goes strangely wrong. The plot from here, tells of what went on, the lifes of friends afterwards and finally takes a strange twist into 'the afterlife' all brought on by a seance. A little confusing if you don't understand past lives or Pike's past books. A dissapointment in that the back cover synopsis doesn't peek it's face until the 20th chapter. Still, a Pike classis where you know the characater by heart and the ending always throws you for a loop. Intresting, but mediocre, I rate this book 3 stars. I would recommend this to Pike fans as 'a book along the way'. Not a starter book. Read his other books first."
3,Pike has done better....,"While the tale in itself is fascinating, it's definitely not one of Pike's best. A lot of the chapters were short and choppy, and the plot doesn't flow as well as it could. I definitely didn't like the way Tom just popped up out of nowhere, especially since he's supposedly been with Mary for thousands of years. It's not the greatest, but die hard fans will still appreciate it."
3,Who knows,"I've never read this book, but I recomend it. I've read his entire Last Vampire series along with Bury Me Deep, The Immortal, and Midnight Club. All of these were exellent books, and I doubt The Visitor will fall below these standards."
5,Excellent,"This stuff is so delicious my family and many of our friends use it in making deserts! Can be used in salads, etc. also. Great for diabetics as vinegar lowers blood sugar. All Cuisine Perel balsamic vinegars are delicious! Even my kids love it, and that says a lot!"
5,BRINGS BACK MEMORIES,I HAD LOTS OF THESE SONGS ON 45 RECORDS. MUSIC OF MY TEEN YEARS FOR MY WIFE AND ME. GREAT TO HEAR IT ALL OVER AGAIN TO BRING BACK GREAT MOODS. YOU CAN'T GO RONG WITH BEST OF RECORDS.
2,Flip are not known for there hardware,Hey alright Flip are not a known bran for there hardware i Would et silverados or lucky they are 2 well known brands who are the best
3,not highly recommended,"The reason that I gave this game a 3-star rating is because after playing only a few times, the categories were already repeating themselves. My friend and I could predict the words without the clues based on the category title because we had just played them a couple of rounds earlier. Otherwise, the graphics and game play we very good but they don't really compensate for the lack of challenge."
3,"$100,000 Pyramid","The game is fun but frustrating because the ""celebrities"" give the same clues over and over again. Which makes it impossible to get the correct answer and prevents you from advancing int he game. I have also run in to the same questions early on in the game."
3,And the answer is.........,"With graphics and music true to its television original, this computer rendition of the game show classic is fun and challenging. In spite of this, its one major drawback significantly detracts from the game. When playing the one person game, if you miss a category or clue you're not given the correct answer."
4,Entertaining!,"I think overall this game is very entertaining and nostalgic. Pyramid is one of my favorite gameshows and it is really great fun to be able to play anytime I want. The graphics are very well done, and the music is updated and appropriate. The one drawback is that the categories repeat over and over, and it only took about ten rounds of play for me to have the majority of the answers memorized. For the most part, this was money was well spent."
3,Little Angel,"Having only in recent years become an avid gardener, I'm now reaching a point where I feel my flowerbeds are impressive enough to warrant decorative items. The Annabelle Stone was my first decoration for a bed of mums and pansies.I apparently did not read the description well when ordering and was quite disappointed to see that my stone was only 3 1/2 x 5 1/4 inches. I would have liked something at least 8-10 inches tall, as it's already becoming a challenge to find a spot in my flowerbed that's bare enough to display such a tiny stone.My granddaughter thinks the little angel is a likeness of her, so I guess that it's worth the purchase price for her to feel she has a special place in my garden!"
2,You'll need glasses!,"While this little plaque is cute as a bug, it is teeny! I was shocked to find it was no bigger than the palm of my hand. Silly me to assume I was getting somethin about a 5X7 size."
5,an intimate look at Jane Austen's life/times,"The Biography channel does the life and times of famous people better than anyone else, and this biography of Jane Austen is no exception. It includes commentary by Jane Austen experts, as well as dramatizations of events in Austen's life. Every Janeite should own it."
5,Fantastic!,"I never thought I would love a spatula, but I do! This thing is sturdy - not flimsy like the ones we have used in the past."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,I LOVE THE COLORS AND THE HEAT RESISTANCE BUT FOUND THE WOODEN HANDLE ON ONE SPATULA ROUGH AND SPLINTERY. ALSO THE SPATULA IS SHOWING NICKS ON THE EDGES OF THE SILICON....DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I DON'T USE IT ON ROUGH EDGED BOWLS OR PANS.
5,Love le creuset,Great color - green and bright and works well. I will always love le creuset quality and buy it when I can.
4,Great Tool,"I have several of these spatulas, they are my go-to tool. I like that they are full-size (handle length) but have a slender head. It's not floppy, fully functional, the perfect size to handle my needs. The only downside, if you could call it one, is the wood handle - I don't put them in the dishwasher, so it adds to my hand washing. On the plus side, they clean up super quick."
4,Great buy,I purchased this particular item at a retail store. The reason i did was because it was a need at the time. Anyway i would recommend this item to anyone that is looking for a tv\dvd remote because not only will it work on the tv and playstation dvd but you DONT NEED A MEMORY CARD for it to work.Unlike the sony version which makes you get a memory card and download drivers from a cd to the memory card which just takes up space. My buttons are not backward like the other reviews say. It works great the only reason i did not give all 5 stars is that the t.v. part of the remote does not have a mute button or a sleep enabeled button for the t.v. that have thouse features. But other than that the remote works great.
2,should have gotten the saitek one,"dont recomend buying this, the other remote is a lot better and i know for a fact cause my freind has it, it has many more feature like not haveing to plug or unplug your controler and has more buttons but i already bought it and all i have to say is get the saitek dvd remote they really screweed this one up compared to it competetion"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I bought this remote at the same time I purchased my PS2. It doesn't work with the vast majority of the movies that I rent, and I end up using the game controller, which in the end is just fine."
2,Ick,"When I picked up my PS2 I grab this thing too. It looked cool and said did all the same things as the other remotes.Home, this thing is backwards. I don't know if it is just mine or what, but when I have to hit enter I actually have to hit 'cancel'.I would have bought a different one if I had known (even if it looked dorky)."
1,Broken in Minnesota,When I bought my PS2 I bought this remote less than 6 months ago. It does not work any more. One day it just stoped working. At first I thougt the batteries might be dead but when I put new ones in it still didn't work. I didn't drop it or anything I've actualy been very carefull with the entire system having spent over a grand on the system accessories and games already. I just ordered the remote by Sony and I hope that one will last longer.
1,Don't Bother,"I haven't purchased this item, and I am a bit skeptical why anyone would. If you have PS2, then you obviously must have a controller, right? Well, there you go. The PS2 Dual Shock Controllers, or any PS2 controllers, work as remotes when you are playing a DVD. The L and R buttons work as fast foward and rewind, while pressing either start or X enables you to pull up a menu of option (pause, play, stop, main menu). Just pull out your PS2 manual and figure out the different controls for controlling the DVD player portion of PS2. Don't bother wasting your money on a remote when you can just use your controller."
3,Not bad at all.,"While this would not be my first choice of recording for Vivaldi's opus III, you could definitely do much worse than this fine recording with the St. Petersburg Soloists. The playing is even and technically perfect. There are even some interesting and creative decisions made in the playing, particularly in the double violin concerto where there is quite a tiny but satisfying surprise. The strings are decidedly modern sounding, but do provide a rich and strong sound. On the other hand, the music sounds a bit distant; perhaps the engineers were trying to replicate more of a concert hall experience, but it is not what you expect from a modern digital recording. Gantvarg himself is quite interesting, bears a striking resemblance to one of the portraits that we have of Vivaldi, and conducts from the violin. So I guess I would mostly recommend this to Gantvarg enthusiasts or those who would like to know more about the Russian performing schools."
2,long cleanup time,"This product may have saved me some time in actual painting, but the cleanup was very messy and took much of my time savings away. I had difficulties getting the pieces apart during the cleanup and when they came apart, paint went everywhere. Also, paint kept coming out of places I just could not get to and I am wondering how well this will work the second or third time. One other criticism is that the mechanism to pull the paint from the can kept slipping in the can making it very difficult on refills (which are often.)."
2,NOT so EZ Twist Stick,"I was disappointed with the Black & Decker EZ Twist Paint Stick -- It took 1 1/2 ""fills"" just to prime the roller. Also had to refill the paint stick approximately the same number of times needed to refill a standard paint roller for the same-sized wall. The paint stick might be easier on an 8-foot ceiling--would not have to go up & down a ladder (not any easier on my 10-foot ceilings).HOMERIGHT C800660 PAINTSTICK EZ-TWIST BLACK&DECKER"
2,Great 1st/2nd time use...dont count on this for uses after that though,"Exactly as described the first 1-2 times you use. After that, forget it...typical of Sears products. Very messy and time consuming to clean. The latest debacle is that paint leaks out of the fill port on the stick. The ""troubleshooting"" section of directions: If paint leaks out of fill port, replace valve kit for fill port. Well..how helpful that is! So the time saved on the first two rooms painted has just been eclipsed by the time investment to get back to sears, hope they have the replacement part...etc...FORGET IT....JUST DO IT MANUALLY LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE"
4,Paint or Clean - pick your poision,"This thing does save you a lot of time painting, but it is a much longer clean up process than a standard roller, especially if you do it as the directions state. Of course, I never clean a roller -- I would rather just toss them then bother with it. It was very nice not having to fill the roller brush all the time. I didn't have any problems with leaking or getting the paint started, but I will say that you do have to put quite a bit of pressure on it when the handle is all the way out. I am five feet tall, and generally find all rollers with extension handles akward to use. My suggestion would be to paint with a buddy -- so you can take turns using this thing. Do not break this thing out for small jobs -- the clean up time isn't worth it. Overall, you are going to save time painting but spend some of that time cleaning. I guess it depends on what you would rather do."
2,The roller pops off!,"I have used paint sticks in the past with great results. Sure the cleanup is a little more involved than with the standard roller but the painting goes quicker and cleaner. Buy the standard paint stick and not the EZ Twist. The EZ Twist has a locking endcap that leaks, becomes loose and the roller starts popping off. What a mess! I took the EZ Twist back to the store for a refund. I went to Sears and luckily they had the standard paint stick available. Sometimes you get what you pay for but sometimes you get something fancier that actually doesn't work as well."
3,Nice costume but...,The costume was comfortable and breathable. It can be a lot of fun to wear but....People WILL mistake you for a Klan member....
3,Face hole too small,"The face hole too small so it was un comfortable to keep on for any amount of time. Suspect one size fits all is the culprit. However all in, it was a fun n relatively in expensive costume to have. uTube vid at [...]"
5,"Great, compact and precise",This book is a must have for Airplanes lovers. It has a small footprint (good for travelling) and has very precise info and very good pictures. It has all the basic info regarding commercial airplanes...
2,Title should be Commercial Airliners,"Contains no business jets, as the title would imply. Airliners only."
1,Lasted 2 months,With regular use the compressor stopped working after just over two months. We have tried to call the support phone number on the unit multiple times with absolutely no response.
4,Paasche Compressor,"The compressor works fince, except you are supposed to regualte the pressure and i have never been able to figure out how to chand it"
5,34th Season opener-Biggest win ever-,Joe's leadership & Strategy beat Arizona by wide margin..a fitting tribute for Happy valley..Let's hope Joe goes on..to atleast 2000...
3,Don't Buy This One if you Own Other Paterno Books,"If I had bought this book first, I probably would have been happy with the book. But as an owner of four other books relating to Coach Paterno I found this one to be a repeat of the other writings. I really learned nothing new from this book at all. Maybe I expected too much or maybe Paterno's story has already been told."
2,Disappointed,"I received one of these products as a Christmas present 2 years ago and loved it! I used it daily until one day it just quit. I thought it was the battery, but it turned out the motor blew in just a little over a year! So I bought another one in April of 2005, I used it 2 weeks and it quit working! I have made several attempts to get some cooperation from the Euro Pro company, and they just keep promising me they will ship me parts. I have not yet received them, and are beginning to wonder if I will. Very disappointing!!"
3,Thin but all in one,"When I received this book from Amazon, it was true that I was disappointed a little bit because it looked very thin and small. Yeah, the price was good but... However, when I started reading this book, I found that it was totally efficient and portable. Very visual pictures were included in this book so it was very good to understand even thought it was a little bit hard subject."
3,Coaching Successfully Review,It's a good little book that introduces various life coaching techniques. Easy to slip into a pocket for reference as a memory jogger.
3,Serious lack of enthusiasm...,"Monotone narration, but they seem to try on the filming with some good shots of high speed sliding. Over all not bad for a first attempt. However a far cry from the statement on the cover: ""Drift Battle is a classic in the making""."
4,Slick slice of late-'80s hard rock,"Babylon A.D.'s eponymous debut is a prime slice of late-'80s hard rock, complete with slick production, heavy riffs, and huge choruses. Derek Davis' vocal work is a perfect example of the bluesy, melodic style of the time, and Ron Freschi's guitar playing is both big and memorable. Definitely a fun album to listen to, with catchy hits like ""Bang Go The Bells,"" ""Hammer Swings Down,"" and ""The Kid Goes Wild,"" plus lesser-known cuts such as ""Caught Up In The Crossfire,"" and ""Desperate."" Freschi's got a new project he's in the midst of recording called Syrym (http://www.syrym.com), and their music harkens back to the heavier melodic sound of this first Babylon A.D. release."
4,"""Billy pulled up---to Big Jim's Liquor Store""","I checked the ending credits of Robo Cop 2 to find out what the song playing during the scene at the video arcade was. It was ""The Kid goes Wild"", from A.D.'s first album. I bought it for that song but there are more. ""Back in Babylon"", is probably the best. ""Desperate"" and ""Hammer Swings Down"" are good rockers. This is some excellent hard rock with a somewhat religious tone. I could believe these guys went to the same church when they were kids. Some of the lyrics make me think of the church I attended as a kid. But don't get me wrong, this is definitely not gospel music. Sam Kinison talks in the song ""The Kid Goes Wild"". Or I should say screams."
3,Not as bad as previous reviewer,"I bought these at Sam's Club for just over $15.00. I would NOT pay anymore than that since the quality is 2nd rate for many episodes. But there are many shows that are of OK quality and depending on your TV reception back in the 50s and 60s, these might look great!Anyway, buy at your own risk but I think for what I paid it was a good deal. It might even be worth more to some."
5,Excellent CD,"I'll try to be helpful and not just gush. The songwriting is strong, the cast of musicians is wonderful and the fact that Dion could write and sing this material is amazing. It may have been the fact that Dion had people like Dave Edmunds, Paul Simon, Lou Reed, etc.., who really admire and respect his earlier work, giving their all, that made this record so good. The only other Dion ""record"" I own is the one released right before Yo Frankie, called Velvet and Steel. Very good, but not as good as this (and also out of print)."
4,one name - DION - thats all you need to know,Anyone who thought Dion made all of his best music in the 50's and 60's has'nt listened to Yo Frankie. He saved a few rockin tunes for the 90's too! -King of the New York Streets- alone is worth the price of the CD.
4,Clean Dion recording,"Good, clean rock. Fine songs. Surprising guest artists.His earlier 'Christian' 80s were more soulful though."
5,File Next to Springsteen,"It is always best to take albums on their individual merits. Ignoring who Dion was and who he is now -- we have well-written songs that have a Jersey/NYC feel, in line with Bruce Springsteen's more mainstream stuff (not Nebraska). Good, strong voice - he makes the best of his admittedly limited range. The production threatens to go towards a little too much slickness that detracts from the earnest lyrics of ""Written on the Subway Wall"", so it flows along in a radio-friendly way, but I remember that this album got very limited airplay. It isn't one of the greatest albums of all time, but it is a album that reveals quite a bit of depth and intelligence -- an unexpected treat."
4,If You Are or Ever Were A Dion Fan -Don't Miss This One,"Add this to your Dion collection, the guy was talented in the 50's through the millenium! ""Little Star"" (with the Paul Simon interlude) is fantastic, as is ""Yo Frankie"" and ""King of the New York Streets"" ...indeed he is.PS while you're at it, pick up Dion's latest, ""Deja Nu"", also."
5,excellent ear warmers,I have previously owned other ear warmers 180s style with just the plain material but these faux suede keep my ears and my MOM's much warmer.
1,Disappointing,"The product is disappointing, not the seller...they are too lightweight and totally made for looks, not keeping ears warm OR staying on - they slip off all the time."
4,Great Guide,"As the author ofMiriam Daughter of Finnish ImmigrantsI was invited to present my book at an international conference in Turku, Finland. In preparation for my first trip to Finland, I purchased The Lonely Planet as a guide book. The book provided a wealth of information about the history of Finland, the Finnish culture, points of interest and helpful hints for tourists. My sister and I used it everyday as we planned our sight seeing activities in Turku and Helsinki. Definitely make room for this book in your Finland travel gear!"
4,I love the SG,Great guitar for the money. I had to adjust certain things to my liking but so what. It comes with a hardshell case (something I did not see noted when I purchased it). I'm sure it'll last me forever. ****See the photo I uploaded in the pics section.I play this guitar almost everyday. It is that FUN! :))))))))))
4,"Dated, but useful","This dictionary is specifically intended for beginning students, it contains a limited vocabulary(I guess about 7000-8000) English entries, each entry is given from 1 to 4-5 Tagalog equivalents, different meanings of English entry words are shown by synonyms, eg. english_entry - (english_synonym1) tagalog_meaning1, (english_synonym2) tagalog_meaning2, (english_synonym3) tagalog_meaning3 etc. Accent place and glottal stops - an important feature of Tagalog - is clearly shown. The list of affixes appears to be very useful.In short introduction the author relates the troubled circumstances of the WWII in whgich this short dictionary was born.Of course the dictionary is dated, however since it deals only with the very basics of the language which change but very little with the time, it can be quite useful for the contemporary student."
4,cell phone charger,"The charger works very good. The phone charges very quickly. However, it seems to get hotter than other chargers I've used."
4,Excellent b.g. information on everyone's favorite magazine,"It was interesting to read about the writers and editors who helped make The New Yorker a magazine of such distinction. I bought this book during that whole rage of last year when ""Gone: The Last Days of The New Yorker"" was all over the place. In the time since I read this book, I resubscribed to the magazine. Periodically, I read glimpses of the magazine's former glory in its pages. I don't think I could read ""Gone,"" though. Even though I know The New Yorker is not as good as it once was, that doesn't mean I have to take a broom handle to it. That's why I found ""Here at The New Yorker"" great, pricisely because of its balance."
4,"A fine companion to ""About Town""","Having just read the new ""About Town The New Yorker and the World it Made"" I felt compelled to go back and reread Brendan Gill's memoirs of his days working for Harold Ross and William Shawn.Some critic called ""Here at the New Yorker"" ""wonderful entertainment"". That is wrong--this book does not entertain it probes. Granted there are some funny anecdotes and glances of writers like Scott Fitzgerald. But the book has a darker more serious side as well.I imagine that Brendan Gill has made many enemies with his book. He talked about Editor Harold Ross's racism and William Shawn's phobias. Of many he writers he either praises them or he says they did not produce much legible writing at all.But these dark character portraits are wonderfully written and penetrate deep. After reading Gill I think I can more carefully size up my peers. This one is a drunk never-do-well. That one works all day to keep away from his wife. Brendan Gill has the novelist's eye for detail."
1,For the non programmer or non technical reader,"The title should be asp.net 2.0 Demystified for the Clueless. It assumes you know nothing about programming then trys to explain loops, sub routines, functions and data types; if you understand these this book isn't for you.Besides the errors mentioned in other reviews this book continually let's you know you can build ASP.NET sites using notepad, while technically true who would want to when VWD Express Edition is available Free and even comes on CD with the 24 hours book.A better starter book would be ASP.NET 2.0 for Dummies by Bill Hatfield. If you are a bit higher on the learning curve try ASP.NET 2.0 in 24 Hours by Scott Mitchell."
2,"Confusing, incomplete, inaccurate","After the first 2 chapters, it was painfully clear this book was not written by someone familiar with the release version of Visual Studio 2005 - which this book references and recommends for following along with the examples. I will give the author the benefit of doubt on this - and assume that he simply tried to write this book too early using a pre-release version of Visual Studio 2005. Regardless, the result is an extremely confusing tour of ASP.NET 2.0. This is particularly disappointing given the intended audience for this book.I could find none of the downloadable examples mentioned, but even more frustrating was that I could find no errata on the McGraw-Hills Web site or on Jim Keogh's Web site.I strongly suggest you avoid this book. I will be returning it today."
2,Too many errors,"This book has too many errors where the author intended to type one thing, but wrote something different. There are also the usual typos. This makes the book confusing to a beginner as you'd only catch some of these errors if you already knew ASP.NET. In most cases, the broken examples have the potential to cause the reader hours of frustration.All in all this is one of the worst edited technical books I've seen."
3,work fine but burned ceiling,"I inserted these in the bathroom light fixture which is a foot below the ceiling. The bulbs are placed a bit lower to be in the center of the fixture, so they are not close to the ceiling.There was what appeared to be a shadow from the globes, but as it became darker over time I looked very closely and saw the ceiling was blackened from the bulbs.Never had this happen before and 25W is such a low wattage to emit this kind of heat.There is nothing enclosing the bulbs to build up heat so it is puzzling."
4,6 years and still going...,"I was so surprised to see this watch on sale, especially through a deal site. I have worn this watch almost daily for the past 6 years and it's become another appendage around my left wrist. I have other watches that I'm ready to ""grow up"" to, but my Seiko is really an all-purpose watch - it's not too classy, but not too casual. It fits any and every need.As it's primary function, timekeeping has been precise. The stopwatch function is nice, but after you get past the novelty, it probably won't be used much.A thing to note is that the date function does not auto-adjust for months with <31 days. So, that still needs to be tweaked by hand.All in all, a very fine timepiece. If I had another left hand, I would wear one on that one as well."
4,Good Value for Money,Very nice piece. Feels right on my wrist. The dial color contrasts nicely with the stainless steel bracelet. The numbers are very legible. The dial does not look too busy. Can't get a better deal for the price !!
5,Very Pleased,"Very fast shipping! The watch was perfect, just as in the description! Very happy with my purchase!"
4,EXCELLENT,"Ladybug Transistor is a chamber pop band who came and went in the late 1990s. I got this 1999 when it came out, played it6 a few times and all but forgot it until I rediscovered it in my collection.This is not a sunny, chipper take on Chamber Pop. Albemarle Sound mines a soft, slightly down beat take on the genre. The stings and horns are ready for the hearing. But they are mixed into extremely gentle, sometimes weepy-eyed tracks about love and loss. Listen to ""Here Comes The Rain,"" which slyly mixes a drippy sentimentality with instrumental craft.Personally, I find this album a bit of a downer. If there is really such a thing as sunshine pop, this is that for a stormy, claustrophobic day behind closed doors and looking out wet foggy windows. Given a choice I would shoot for the upbeat jazzy sound of a band like Swandive, but that is a sheer matter of taste.If you like the more vulnerable side of this music, you won't go wrong with Ladybug Transistor"
5,Great Story! Must Read.,"This story of cousins who share a deep bond along with some family secrets is a must read for anyone who loves irreverant humor and characters who stay with you long after the book ends.From the opening pages when I first met Charma Deane, her nemesis Bess, and the women who live in and around the Aunt Farm I was charmed, touched and tickled. The story explores relationships in all forms including social Southern small town life, true love, old friendships and new. But most of all it shows the power of women.This is the kind of book that would be perfect for a book club or just to share among friends. It will be on my 'keeper' shelf."
3,Enjoyable but not memorable,This book was just a little above ok for me which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2. It did get better after a very rough start for me but I don't feel changed in any way after reading this book and it would be hard to tell you exact details of the story. So truly there are better books out there and better ways to spend your time.
5,Looking for a great summer read,If only there were a whole shelf of Luanne Jones books to read my summer would be all about reading. Her characters are real with the flavor of the south. I am waiting for more from this very talented author.
2,Here We Go Again,"Another we were off-the-wall girls together tale set in the South, with the requisite eccentrics in the family [as in, everybody]; and old wounds inflicted by one another. The supposedly upper-crust [for their small town] characters talk like dock-whallopers, yet can't speak the truth to each other about the simplest irritants or issues. Well, down South, you know, you're supposed to sugar-coat home truths. The style which consistently withholds all except vague references to how one cousin betrayed the main character are clearly meant to keep the reader turning pages trying to find out what happened. The problem with all this is soon I didn't care. Contrary to literary belief in other climes, I don't believe families in the South are all so whacked and messed-up, and I'm not even from the South. Nor was this family interesting to me, rather--sorry to say--just tedious. The author can write a decent English sentence. I just didn't like her material."
1,The healing techniques were much too complicated.,"Other than the words to live by, the book was too complicated to either understand or put into action. Unless I totally misinterpreted the text, the proceedures had to be done by at least one other person to help. My spiritual journey is personal, I don't expect others to understand, how would you find other people to help out if they don't get it?"
2,Whine Whine,I spoiled myself by starting off watching season 6. I have just watched the first 4 episodes of season 1 and there is a huge difference. The bad guys are just as clever but there is very little in the way of the blockbuster action in season 6. Also Jack's wife is a whiner from hell and his daughter is nothing special. The old cliche of kidnapped wife and daughter does not help.
5,CHECK IT OUT,"I bought this to help train my Dane who is fearful and reacts to other dogs. We worked on the ""check it out"" to show him it was something safe. I had to start with it in another room until we found his safe threshold. All 5 of my dogs reacted in some way, as they initially thought it was real. Fun Dog. I will get others in different sizes/breeds."
3,Cute Boxer!,Very cute and sturdy. Will do well for a prop in a show. Do feel it's a bit pricey. But no competition at this size!
4,it looks amazing,"I don't really consider this plush a toy. It looks amazing, it was half the price of the store. The markings, the size is really perfect. Love it, recommended and will buy from this company again."
5,Cocktail Picks,"Excellent product and just as pictured. I would definitely order again and recommend highly to anyone else looking for stylish, inexpensive barware."
3,Only 30 minutes of music,The CD contains only 30 minutes of music. Rather short compared to other CDs of highlights of this opera.
2,"Great music, cheap packaging/insert","The music is great. I also appreciate that MovieMars got the CD to me quickly, but the CD has a cheap one page insert that seems like it's from a bargain bin - or BMG music service, which is more likely the case. My decade old tape of ABWH has a FAR better, multi-page insert, including all of the lyrics. I understand that at this price I should be happy with the CD sounding good and being in good shape upon arrival, but it would be nice to get a decent booklet (or ANY booklet) with the CD. Years ago I was in the BMG music club, and their products always were bottom basement quality and lacked ANY extras whatsoever. This CD happens to have BMG prominently listed on the CD -- I don't think that's a coincidence."
2,Not Yes,"Boring,bombastic and overproduced.What is it about these guys that the older they get,the more mediocre they become (Bruford excepted)?Truly hit and miss from these fellows.Simplify the songs and structures and give us a more visceral approach.Mariah Cary would feel very comfortable singing on this album(which is not a good thing)!"
2,"No, This Isn't....YES!!!!","This CD has it's moments, but this definitely isn't Yes. I kind of enjoy the whole ""Brother of Mine"" theme. Unfortunately, the whole concept of this CD gets confusing and annoying after a while. Save your money and buy the real deal...Fragile, Close To The Edge, or about anything else!!!"
2,Electronic drums?,"This recording consists of 4/5's of the classic Yes lineup attempting to revive the glory of their heyday. Unfortunately, they do not succeed. Bill Bruford, perhaps progressive-rock's finest drummer chose to play the Simmons Electronic Drums on this recording and as a result, his playing sounds dated and void of personality. The normally impressive Tony Levin covers for the absent Chris Squire and sounds gimmicky and is clearly the odd-man out. Wakeman does a decent job, as does Anderson although the compositions and lyrics are not particularly strong. Steve Howe was going through a phase of attempting to sound relevant and contemporary, only to lose(temporarily) that which made him unique. Give this one a pass, stick to Yes (any of their seventies output or the Keys to Ascension recordings)...Simon"
4,Ranks with classic Yes,"Anyone looking for a classic return to form - 70's Yes albums from Fragile to Going for the One - this is the CD for you. Brother of Mine is brilliant, and the rest of the album equally lives up to the challenge (with the possible exception of the somewhat long-winded Birthright). Like the best Yes music, it stands up to repeated listenings and keeps revealing new treasures."
5,WHAT ... ONLY 5 STARS????,"Well if you like YES, I mean real YES not this Trevor Rabbit stuff, this album will blow you away. Easily the best YES since Close to the Edge. On a scale from 1 - 10 I'd give this one a 12."
2,Quite Disappointed...,"Aiming to improve my YES collection, I purchased this cd based solely on the musicians playing it...and not on the time frame the album was released. I am a huge classic YES fan, and when I popped this cd in it immediatley made me cringe. Where there once was intricate rhythm and tempo changes and all around creativity, this album has 80's dance beats and boring melodies.Unless you are into cheesy pop music, this is probably not something you want to add to your library.The YES Re(Union) album is way, way more like the older sound that I appreciate. Evidently ABWH band came up with some material and Chris Squire and co. contributed some content...add a few years to trim the fat and Re(Union) ends up with minimal ABWH and a bunch of Chris Squire led Yes music with Jon Anderson rerecording lyrics over it.I would NOT recommend this album...see Re(Union) for the same era yet much better music."
3,Better sounding live,The live version of this music is mostly better because it has a harder sound. Their second effort which ended up on Union was really going to new and better sounding places but we will never know how it would have ended up.
2,Not a big fan,"I liked the YES products, their first two albums were really good. This product was mixed very badly, and the songs are very weak. But I'm a big E.L.P. fan, but I'm also a recording engineer too. This product should have been thought out alittle bit better. That's just my opinion. I was never a big Rick Wakeman fan, and I've listened to some of his other works. I can't really recommend this product to others, it just doesn't cut the mustard.I've worked with other musicians who just throw some crap together and kick it out the door. Sorry guys, you should have taken some time to put together a better production. This product doesn't show a good investment of your time.But nither did some of the E.L.P. products, every dog has his day. Alot of times this happens due to label presure to put out a product on a deadline.Sorry mates, maybe next time."
5,Definitely Yes,"I remember owning this as an album thirty years ago, and purchased it from Amazon as a CD. It is a great Yes album, and if you like Yes I can't see how you wouldn't love this album. The music is incredibly complex and the lyrics as spacey as any Yes album ever. This is a must have for any Yes fan. The only problem is the packaging, which was pretty elaborate as an album, as I recall, but in its present incarnation there are no lyrics or anything else. I would say get this soon, if you have been thinking about it, because this CD could easily go out of print, or so it seems to me, as music from this time period disappears."
5,"It's a Yes album, dammit!!!","This album is one of Yes's greatest albums, despite not being a Yes album. In a rather silly move, the band's name, Yes, was owned by Chris Squire, who didn't participate on this album (Tony Levin filled in for Chris here), so it was called Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe. Having said that, it's a great album, on the epic scale of Yes's best material. The opening song, Themes, is a great, complex song, performed and sung with great passion. Brother of Mine is a favorite too, especially in the 10 minute version (there was a shorter version released as a single). Most of the tracks here are around 9 minutes or so, and it's a pleasure to hear the Yes boys (without Squire) get back into real prog rock. This album also has one of the best Roger Dean covers ever. It's really beautiful, and my personal favorite. Surprisingly, this CD is out of print (record company boneheads), but it's rather cheap on the collector's market, so pick it up if you can."
3,a forgotten album,Brother of Mine is one of the most beautiful songs these men ever performed. You should buy the album for this song alone.
4,It's a love-hate thing,"I cannot honestly recommend this if you haven't heard some of it. It's like that disliked relative that shows up at a family reunion he hasn't been invited to- what do you do with him? Here is a couple of very fine songs, that fit well in the Yes universe- The Order Of The Universe is just a good tune. My personal favorite is Long Lost Brother Of Mine, but for sentimental reasons- when I heard this track, I was in a new city, about 1300 miles from friends and family, and I was really missing a close friend, hence the song 'spoke' to me. You just have to like it or not. Most people won't. This is one of those guilty pleasures you keep to yourself. Nobody else will understand."
5,SHE'S CUTE,"WELL THE FIRST THING I NOTICE IS THAT SHE HAS VERY! THICK LEGS. (ALL THE BRATZ BIG BABYZ DO.) BUT I GUESS THAT'S TO HELP THEM STAND UP BETTER? (THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I CAN THINK OF ANYWAY.) OTHER THAN THAT SHE IS VERY CUTE AND I REALLY LOVE THE LONG, FLOWING, KINDA-WAVY HAIR. REALLY CUTE FELICIA DOLL. 4.5 STARS."
5,Very Cute Doll,"I originally purchased this very doll from a local retail store back when I lived in Florida. Imagine my surprise when I found her, and the fact that she was marked down to a mere $13.00! LOL I suppose I purchased this doll for my daughter more for self-esteem reasons than anything else (same skin tone), but I think Felicia is as cute as a button! I like the hip flair of her little outfit and makeup, and appreciate the bands placed around the socks so that they don't slip off. Felicia remains one of my daughter's favorite dolls because of the hair, which she is always combing. It's a very durable doll, but my two older sons got their hands on it and now one of her arms is broken. GGGRRRRR!!!!!!! Sooo, I promised my daughter I'd buy her a new one. Go figure..."
1,This book talks about everything,"This book really should be called: ""The 10,000 Best Books on Sales, Marketing, Management, and General Business Compressed into 272 Easy and Small Pages So That Anyone Can Read Them."" It has way too much information in way too condensed of a format.And, you guessed it...a book that talks about everything doesn't do a good job of talking about anything. And, it's as much about marketing a service as it is an exhaustive compendium on the success of Wal-Mart.It gave me a headache. It's written in Aesop's fable format, with a short tale in each of the 300 sections, and then a simplistic moral at the end of each of them.I can see only two uses for this book. It could be an introductory book for someone who has never read a business book before, and wants a quick scan of a bunch of business topics. The other use could be for speakers. If you want a ready-made 1 minute speech on a business topic, this book has about 300 of them."
5,Just the book you need to read.,"I picked up this book at a motivational seminar where they were demonstrating the hot new software Neurosync, a behavior modification and goal oriented process. I read it this book first from a service marketing perspective. However, I found that Customer Service professionals, Service Sales and whoever actively involved or interested in service business would eventually benefit from this excellent book. I shared one of the book's concept of ""Say P.M. Deliver A.M."" with a team of customer service engineers recently and they loved the idea. This is the most important book I've read in my fast moving career."
1,Probably it's great in Hardcover. Audiobook could be better,"Have bought the audio version for educational fun during driving times.Note my comments here are only about audiobook:- Vocal variety is WEAK. Jeffrey Jones did not sell the ideas to his own heart, so he reads the text with good and clear pronunciation, but personal passion is not there and trust to him has not appeared.Ideas are very nice, but because of the above - it is very easy to loose attention especially during driving. I had to rewind a bit back this cassette several times because of that.- Tom Hopkins has worse pronunciation (for me, as for non-native speaker), but he is adorable in terms of voice, which is key for audiobook.- Again: the book should be great, as judged by other reviews, and i would probably buy in hardcover. Audiobook - NO. Not until they change the reader, or Jeffrey will buy those ideas himself"
1,"Save your money, find another book.","This book is a definite waste of money. Fortunately, I checked it out of the library and did not pay for it, so I am only out a few short hours. It is poorly written, the ideas were not well-presented and I was very let down because all of the reviews said it was good, but I found quite the opposite. I would not recommend this book to my dog."
4,marketing book,"I didnt like the class too much, but the book was fine. Another required read. Got an A in the class though."
5,"Very easy to read, obvious to understand, great examples","Beckwith seems to write in a style that enables almost anybody with a basic understanding of commerce to get the message. The messages in this book are straight to the point for anyone in a service related industry. The idea that we can choose when we wish to communicate with our customers is demolished in this book. It is full of practicle advise on how to correct behaviour that is counter-productive to your business. Why not read it, what have you got to loose."
5,Great Book!,this is perhaps one of the best marketing books I have ever read in my life. It is written in a very simple and clear language. I strongly recommend it to everybody thinking about really improving the service they give to their clients and the way business should be done.
4,It really is modern marketing,"This book is well written, clear in thoughts and full of summaries. It fits the modern age and provides you with the ABC's of sales, customer service & marketing."
4,"If you sell a non-tangible product or service, buy this book","It is much easier to sell a book than it is to sell life insurance. Why? Because the customer can hold and touch and see the book. You can't hold, touch or see insurance. (The policy is not the insurance.)Beckwith understands selling intangibles better than anyone and he tells how in this book. It is in my top ten of business and marketing books for people who sell services. Even if you sell products, you will learn some valuable information. Well worth the money."
3,Mixed Review: frequently just scratches the surface,"The ideas that the author brings up are good, but too often I felt like I wanted more. The second section was irritating. I got the feeling that the author has extensive experience in advising others, but little experience in personally carrying out - nice stories and good talk, but few real world details. On the other hand, I have been able to apply some of the ideas to my business. Stick it out past the second section and it gets a lot better.Bottom line: Not the only book you'll need to learn about marketing your service, but a worthwhile investment."
4,Selling the Invisible - A useful reading when the first goal is surviving!,"This book even after 15 years from its first release in 1997, keeps a strong stimulus as ""food for thought"" on the issue of marketing operations.The author, Harry Beckwith, is a consultant who has ""distilled"" in just over 250 pages, a remarkable series of professional ""best practices"" on issues such as:- the positioning of your company;- corporate communication to prospects and Customers;- Customer satisfaction;- Customer's decision-making process analysis;- supply, pricing and brand management.This book, written in short chapters (2 or at most 3 pages), is very convenient to read (5/10 minutes can be found even during the most ""demanding"" days) is a practical guide to marketing operations.In a nutshell, a pleasant and useful reading to explore ""current"" issues especially nowadays when due to the crisis the first goal is surviving ..."
5,Provocative!,"More new ideas on the how-to's of making a business click, than I've gleaned from multiple other texts!"
3,"""Modern?"" Marketing without mentioning the Internet","Good for the base elements of marketing, but fails to address the criteria-first-based world of the Internet. ""A Field Guide to Modern Marketing"" left out the most modern way to market. It's absence makes the rest of the ideas appear dated and quaint (not worthless) just not up to speed."
4,Just when you thought you knew everything about selling ....,"You will need to read this book with a marker. The short stories are easy to read, over and over again, and the book is peppered with quotes as well. Every now and then I open the book and read my favourite lines or quotes for inspiration; like ""don't look to experts for all your answers. There are no answers, only informed opinions"" and ""do it now. The business obituary pages are filled with planners who waited"" and one of my favourites ""start failing so you can start succeeding.""When you finished reading this book, don't pass it on for someone else to read it; buy them their own copy."
5,Read it - think - act - re-read it - think - act again.,"Harry Beckwith understands the fundamental truths: our customers are individuals and they are afraid. Yet, somehow, Mr. Beckwith imparts hope. It's a gem of a book - I keep it on my desk"
4,Very good from a communication standpoint,Very good book on communication and relationships. Well written and flows very well. Provides sound principles for marketing. Great insight on how to read customers and have a better understanding of what they are thinking. Great book for anybody in the service industry. I recommend.
3,Frustrating,"This book has some really interesting models. I primarily got it for the raccoon, which made me want to rip my hair out. Most origami books I own offer detailed descriptions of the steps in addition to the diagrams. This one depicts the steps, but most steps have no text at all. By the end of the model, some of the steps didn't seem possible. It's not easy to follow at all- poorly written in my opinion."
3,One of the better TFH publications,"One of the better TFH books, this one has actually been updated and has photos in it that don't look like they were taken in 1975! It's a small book that tries to cover basic care, breeding and common problems of quite a few of the more common species of captive kept reptiles, which means it can't get too in-depth on any one in particular.This would be a good book for someone to read BEFORE they purchase a reptile, it would help them decide (based on the descriptions of the lizards and the type of care and housing they require) which type was right for them.The one thing that really bugs me about TFH publications is that they of course use every book as an advertising opportunity to promote their own products, which usually aren't worth diddly compared to other brands. Sure, the price is cheap.. and it really shows in the quality of their products (including most of their books)."
3,"It's okay, but mine choked.","The reception on this phone works well in L.A., but mine choked and wouldn't reboot after 4 months--all I was doing was assigning images to the contacts in my phonebook. A Sprint store replaced the phone (which was still in warranty). But what is truly appalling is that there's no way to download the photos you take to your PC (that I know of) without hacking the phone and getting a mysterious data cable that may not even work. SHAME ON SPRINT for forcing consumers into buying their ridiculous $15 per month minimum just to get the photos out of the phone. The only reason I chose this phone was because it had the highest megapixels available at the time in a cell phone camera. Sigh. Verizon is doing the same thing: pay extra for this... when all you want to do is get the pictures out of the phone. Ugh."
1,Terrible Sound Quality,"This is a poor Sprint phone, full of crackle and echo. When I went in to complain, they did not seem surprised (I was beyond the 30-day return period).Seems that they sell these knowing many people will not figure out what a piece of useless crap it is before the return period is over."
4,Pretty good overall,"I just got this phone about 2 weeks ago. It's pretty easy to use. Voice quality is acceptable. Battery life is terrific. But my favorite feature is the blue lighting on the hinges/sides of the phone. I like this feature because it draws attention to the phone when in use and is just straight-out cool. It's lights are not as good as the previous T-Mobile phone that I had (The Siemens CF62T, which also has lighting effects, except they are around the rim of the keyboard) but it works. Overall, this phone is pretty good. Can take a beating, easy to learn functions/features, fair quality camera, and frigging sweet dynamic lights."
2,Poor sound quality and speaker,"* To be fair, I liked about the phone the camera resolution and the zoom, but it is very slow even on the least resolution.* The camera shutter response is very delayed, that makes it very hard to capture some thing moving even in low speeds.* The phone got a good voice dialing feature but the phone, for some reason, becomes deaf after using the feature for some time. I discovered that the phone gains its hearing-abilities after you erase the recorded voice dial and re-record it.* You can not add your wife work phone and mobile phone to the voice dialing. It has to be only one entry.* Horrible speaker* Un-acceptable voice quality.* The headset volume is very inconveniently loud. And when you try to lower the volume, it goes down but to a certain level. That level is still too loud that can damage your ear drum especially if you are using these silicon headsets from Jabra.JMG."
5,Love It,I used this book to understand my relationship with my new boyfriend. It was so right on the money it was scary. I used the book to understand why at one point I kept getting promoted on my job and kept getting raises and how I was able to buy a car years ago when I was broke and how and why my mom won so much money on the lottery in the eighties and now I know when and how to make monetary decisions and relationship decisions. I even used it to determine when it was best to apply for a consolidation loan that I was denied for in the past and I got the loan.I will always keep this book and refer to it always.
1,Liner only,"This is black with a maroon glitter.It does not blend well, the coverage is a bit spotty, not nice and smooth. I really dislike it. I use it with a liner brush and a little water. You don't get any of the reddish glitter that way though, it just looks like a dull black liner. I don't care for it this way either, but it's the only way I can even figure out how to use it. :/"
4,Bausch and Lomb 5x-20x glass loupe.,"I've used this hand lens for over 20 years and have found it great out in the field, in conditions where a low-power microscope can't travel. The glass is pretty hard and doesn't scratch readily when you clean it. You need very good light to use the 20x."
1,USELESS USELESS USELESS - promotional tool for authors,"This book does not contain a single useful piece of information. The content is made up entirely of generalities, vacuous comments and superficial case descriptions. Someone buying this book (like I) is already aware of homeopathy as a treatment option and would be looking for information that could actually be implemented. If I wanted primitive stories, I would buy ""Three little pigs"".The sole purpose of this book is to extract money from desparate parents and to promote/advertise the services and facilities of the authors."
4,Very nice,The style is beautiful and good quality. The only problem is that they need polished when washed in the dishwasher.
5,Exactly As Advertised,"The ""Greater Tuna"" VCR I ordered was delivered on time and in exactly the advertised condition, although I personally don't care for the form of comedy (ordered on behalf of a friend)"
5,It was just great! In fact I am ordering Tuna Christmas,The whole show was just great! I have never laughed so hard in my life. Even my mother enjoyed it...She thought they were really women...!
3,just ok,"its cute but not the version i saw on hbo, it offers alot less then what i saw and was a little dissipointing."
3,Greater Tuna video of stage play,"Didn't realize this was a video of the stage play. I was looking for the HBO made for TV version. It's still fantastic. fyi, it would not play on my BOSE DVD player, only a cheaper player."
2,Ehhh!,"Locals in Austin go to see one of these ""Tuna"" shows every year. So when we were there we went. It was ok. Getting a bit 'long in the tooth' for this day and age. But we bought the CD as a present for a local. The quality is not so hot."
3,Not as good as A Tuna Christmas,"I first saw A Tuna Christmas which was better than this one. In either production I was fascinated about how those guys made the change from one character to the other. Vera Carp was my favorite character. The playwright was obviously castigating all things conservative. I will watch it again, but won;t recommend it to others. I will, however, recommend A Tuna Christmas to others."
5,Classic dry humor at its best,"If you enjoy Jaston Williams and Joe Sears or not. This is sheer delight to see two men who play every character, male, female or animal and you can tell they enjoy it as much as I do."
4,Specifics could have been better,"I already knew and loved this comedy feature, having performed it on stage at my college, WVU. The production values are very good; these two men are wild talents!My only gripe is that the seller didn't identify obviously enough that this format was VHS tape instead of DVD; as a DVD, the price would have been reasonable, as a tape, the product is over priced. I probably would not have bought this copy if the seller had made it more plain that I was buying a tape, and not a disc."
3,"had mine for five years, still works",I have a used one for sale here:APC PNOTEAC150 150 Watt DC/AC InverterHad it since 2007. still works.
1,Amazing they all love the other books by THE SAME AUTHOR,"I find it very amazing that if you click on the ""See my all reviews"" box that these same people also highly recommend all the other books by the same author? WOW imagine that! Type in the names Harris H. McIlwain and Debra Fulghum Bruce in a search engine and see the 100 other books these people have in print. They sound like the experts for every sickness and illness known to man.There is some good advice, but nothing new here, snake-oil at best like so many books on the market."
5,"Great Book!!! Lots of Info,....!!!","This book has alot for me to be able to refer to & is so easy to understand,...It is so great to be able to turn to a chapter & findmany treatment options to be able to try,...like for instance the one that I hadn't even thought of,...was moist heat,...something that simple,...or a heated swimming pool,..(which some of us do not have),..but I do however have a spa tub,...which will really help meon a regular basis,....I want to suggest to anyone suffering as I am,..& so many of us are,,...with this horrible,....pain,..just check this book out,..you won't be sorry,..I know I am not,...LH"
3,"Lady of Green Cheer ""say:","Book was very vague and outdated. If you truely want to learn more about Fibromyalgia, I suggest ""The First Year Fibromyalgia"" by Claudia Craig Marek. I wish I had checked the publication date before purchasing this book."
5,Excellent Guide for those who suffer.,I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia for several years and haven't really come across any books on the subject that are both therapeutic and comprehensive as this one. I can tell those who are reading this review that I truly feel that I have benefitted physically and emotionally from this book. I recommend it to anyone that is in chronic pain like I am.
4,A great intro to this confusing condition!,I am in the process of seeing a specialist for fibromyalgia after suffering symptoms for many years. I am a 39 year old mom of 4! This book helped me feel I wasn't alone and this wasn't all in my head. The case studies were very helpful and relatable. The diet and supplement info was educational and confirmed for me that antioxidants help tremendously! Also the extreme importance of exercise is emphasized. Thanks!
5,"IF you have FMS, you NEED this book.","Best book out there on fibromyalgia. I've had FMS for seven years and NOTHING--has worked. I read this book three weeks ago--and the 7-step plan REALLY WORKS. If your chronic muscle pain and sleeplessness is affected by daily stressors--grab this book and do what it says. Also try the medications it recommends, including the new Super Aspirins (Celebrex)--which END muscle pain. The exercises also help to keep muscles flexible and ends that ""knotted"" feeling. BUY THIS BOOK! It will change the way you live with FMS."
5,My wife said THANK YOU for this book,"I bought this book for my wife who has had FMS for 4 years. I wanted her to get relief and it seemed like no medication was working. She used to be so active but the past few years have been hard on all of us as she tires easily and has constant muscle pain. The book helped my wife!!! Not only did she learn about the various causes of FMS, she found relief with the exercises and lifestyle approach to treatment. My wife even made an appointment with the author (MCILWAIN) and saw him last month in his Tampa Florida office. He confirmed the diagnosis and helped her understand the program even better. She now is taking only one medication and does the exercises daily. She is managing her time better and not over extending herself. These are simple steps to take to get your life back--and they work. I recommend. WE RECOMMEND!"
4,Good info. here!,"This was a gift I purchased and the reciever has used it well, being a good therapy for the mind and body in what can be a daily struggle in living with Fibro."
5,BUY THE NEWER VERSION of this book--just out!!,"The Fibromyalgia Handbook is the most comprehensive resource for those with this painful problem. While this book is excellent, BUY THE NEW VERSION--revision 3--which was just released in MAY 2003. IT is about 30 percent LARGER with more complementary and alternative therapies for ending pain and fatigue."
1,Pitiful,This cd is BAD!!I bought it after reading on the cover that he learned to play guitar at the crossroads.I don't know where the crossroads were but this IS NOT THE BLUES!!
1,Ain't the blues,"This album is garbage!!He should be ashamed of himself calling this junk blues.No way,no how does this even resemble the blues.The only reason it got one star is because they don't use negative numbers."
4,Back to basics,"John Mellencamp, once again, shows his superb writing attributes in this record. Through catchy melodies, and consistent storylines, he shows why he's the best in showing what Middle America is all about.By far, it's his best and most mature work in his career."
3,Another Strong Album for John..Ho Hum!,"There's cerainly nothing wrong with this solid album, it just didn't take him anywhere new after his critically acclaimed ""Scarecrow"". The singles are all as solid as ever, and he has good moments in the supporting tracks, particularly on ""Hard Times For An Honest Man"". I just felt that after the terrific step forward on ""Scarecrow"", Mellencamp would get more adventurous; he wouldn't take that step until 1993's ""Human Wheels""."
2,What the hell happened?,"After putting out some of the best CD's of the 90's(Tossing Seeds, No Pocky), filled with great, loud, pop punk anthems, Superchunk mellow out and now put out this lame drivel. Almost as bad as the decline and fall of the (also once-mighty but now lame) Goo Goo Dolls. Is success really that important to these bands that they have to stoop to this? Go buy Tossing Seeds now and rock!!!"
5,Funky Training,"Well if you are expecting every single version of every single funk song, then you better look elsewhere. This book contains progressions, licks, grooves ect., to get you into the feel of funk and includes a few pieces at the end.She encourages you to LISTEN to pieces she suggests because that is the best way to learn this style. Transcription of records would more than likely be a must. With this stlye, including R&B;, jazz and even blues, transcribing records or even buying transcription books is the best way to learn these styles, although there are some very good, thorough books on the blues that teachers you everything you need to know.This is a good book, written by a beautiful and intelligent woman."
2,"Good for beginners, useless for the experienced","I'm a funk person. I like writing funky grooves, I play, and have been playing. I've got minimal funk chops, and so I was looking for material to learn more vocabulary from.Well, this book ain't it. It covers the basic of the basic, bread and butter type stuff. I guess it's very good as an intro to funk keyboards. In other words, if these phrases sound foreign to you, then you definitely need to get these bases covered. But beyond that, the book doesn't offer too much.Bottom line: Can the book inject a good amount of funk into a stiff classical player? Yes, and it will cure his bad knee too. (funk heals) If you already know what you're doing fairly well, NO, this book isn't for you."
2,dissapointed.,"very repetitive, midi jam tracks that sound awful,and you are with nothing that you can applyto real world of playing.I gained much more from the Hal Leonard Blues Pianoand Smooth Jazz Piano Series books. i.e. useful licks,chord progressions and basic soloing techniques"
5,B5 a real achievement,"The series set a standard which has not been equaled since. Even the CGI was good for it's time. I purchased, ""The Gathering"" and was a little disappointed but the improvements made in the first B5 Season and each season there after made me very happy I purchased the set."
3,"Good series, but disks arrive scratched","I enjoyed the series of Babylon 5 very much, so I was anticipating my new boxed set of season 4 with all the extras. When I opened the box two disks were loose, and their movement inside the box had badly scrathced them. This had to have happened at the manufacturers, as the packaging is tight enough that if the disks had been properly placed on their center posts they would never have become loose through shipping. Now I have to send them back, wait to see if they refund it, and buy another set elsewhere (so I can hear if the package rattles. Beware of rattling disks, it is the sound disks being damaged)"
2,product review,The product arrived in the prescribed time frame. However one of the dvd's was badly scratched and did not work. I realize it was a used item but I think they should have screened it and let people know that one of the dvd's was bad.
5,Great series!,"The series keeps getting better for us. We watch a few episodes every week and talk about what will happen, motives and repercussions. A wonderful series."
