5,Used CD Review of #rd Force,"I was a late comer to the music of 3rd Force but I loved the Music so much I wanted to get the full catalog of their music. I could not get the Cds because they were out of print, so I was forced to buy them all used. So I found all the Cds on Amazon.com being sold used and I found all the CDs in great shape.. Any one interested in smooth or cool Jazz guitar should check out 3rd force.. All of their CDs are cool......Have a good holiday Johnny G... Long Island"
4,If You Like The Weather Channel Music...,"... This whole album just reminds me of crystal clear water. And I think that's what the artist was going for. Very relaxing, soothing piece of new age music with some nice jazz accents."
5,wonderful music,I just saw this band at the Catalina Jazz festival. They were amazing. Keep at it guys!
3,THE ANNALS OF NEWBERRY,the book does not include enough for the whole of newberry county. the stony hill community plays a large part in the developement of newberry and the county. tx david derrick
4,PalmOne IIIxe handheld,"The handheld came fast and working fine. However, it was missing an appropriate stylus and software CD. I had to purchase the stylus separatelly, whuch forced me to wait another week to use my handheld. I was able to download the software from the Internet for free. I would have appreciated if the seller had told me about these missing items before I bought the handheld."
4,Powerful,"This CD & DVD, of The Bishop Larry D. Trotter is off the chain!!!My Worship is for real and Trouble don't last always is powerfull!!"
5,A Great Book - Beautiful,"This is a timely, beautifully written, and illustrated book. McGovern treats the subject with compassion and sensitivity. The illustrations are great. A 10+"
3,A few scattered diamonds,"The instructional is on CQB tactics with a shotgun only. I dont think its accurate to say its for first responders really, rather just a film on basic cqb. i would have given it a 2 star but the free film 911 tactics which comes with it has some good tactics taught, which gives the package a 3 star rating, however, that film is cut and obviously not complete which is a shame."
5,Very good for shotgun,"Excellent shotgun in the home techniques, secound half suffers bad sound and lighting, but still useful info on securing a building."
5,"Bosch 13077 Oxygen Sensor,OE Type Fitment",I gave this Oxygen sensor 5 stars because of Bosch quialty.I had the orignal on my 1994 GMC truck that needed to be replaced.The price was very reasonable much cheaper then after market auto stores and dealerships .I recommend Bosch products to all my family and friends.
3,Sort of disappointed This Time,"I was thrilled to get the VHS and appreciated the included DVD as a bonus. I was disappointed at the quality recording of both items. I could tell they had been recorded because the clarity of the movie on VHS and the DVD was not there, which disappointed me. I will still watch the movies and appreciated them much as this particular movie was very difficult to find."
2,poorly acted adaptation,"Ustinov doesn't look remotely like Christie's Poirot, but never mind that. It is the ensemble cast that trashes this film, a group of summer actors who read their lines like they are reading graffiti on the rocks. The figure that should provide the menace of the book -- the evil Mrs. Boynton -- is laughable.Skip it. Wait for a more modern adaptation or just reread one of the classic Christies."
2,He's bacccccccccck,"I really enjoyed ""Evil Under the Sun"" and ""Death on the Nile"". However, this one was a very big disappointment. Not much of a story, not a good cast, poorly written with a horrible sound track. There was no suspense and no characters I really care about (except the doctor and Gielgud who would be interesting if he just stood there). It was hard to stay with it but I did. Ustinov looks tired and the rest look bored. Sorry to say, unless you are a collector who wants all of the film Ustinov endeavors (as I did), you will not be missing anything if you dont buy it."
5,"Great movie, but I goofed","Unfortunately I ordered this dvd not realizing it had to be viewed on PAL-enabled dvd player. So it won't play on my American dvd player.Anybody got a solution for me?I love this Agatha Christie movie, which I had a video of, but videoplayer tore up my tape and also I was trying to dump all my videos and replace them w/ dvds.This dvd arrived in perfect condition and fast--I just made mistake ordering PAL and wrong region code. Be careful on those old dvds and Brit stuff if you're using U.S. equipment."
5,"Peter Ustinov gives a brilliant final apperance as Poirot,","I really enjoyed this film, whose highlight is Peter Ustinov, as he plays Hercule Poirot for the sixth and final time. It was as enjoyable as Death on the Nile and Piper Laurie gives a brilliant performance as the malevolent stepmother. The film has a very nice soundtrack composed by Pino Donnagio.Certainly a nice change from thr three made for TV films in which Ustinov stars as Poirot, which are excellent too, namely Thirteen at Dinner and Murder in Three Acts, and Dead Man's Folly, but Ustinov's full potential is really unleashed in the big-screen appearances.Move over David Suchet! There is only one Hercule Poirot, that is Sir Peter Ustinov."
3,Not the best Ustinov Poirot movie by a long shot,"Ustinov made six appearances as Christie's Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, and while the rest are masterpieces which very closely followed Christie's books, this one made some significant variations. While the location is excellent, the cast certainly high powered, and Ustinov's performance certainly outstanding, this movie dragged throughout the first half of the movie, and the second half wasn't much better. It might be the reason why this seems to be the only one of Ustinov's Poirot movies still not available on DVD, or maybe because it was produced by that pioneer of B movies, Cannon Films. If you enjoy Hercule Poirot, then you should get this movie for collection purposes only."
4,Great Adaptation,"I think Michael Winner made a great adaptation of ""Appointment With Death"". They picked just the right actors to fit the parts.The story is about the Boynton family on a 30's Holy Land tour. Mrs. Boynton (Piper Laurie) and her long suffering children Lennox (Nicholas Guest), Nadine (Carrie Fisher), Carol (Valerie Richards), Raymond (John Terlesky) and Ginevera visit Europe and the Holy Land. But their lawyer, Jefferson Cope (David Soul), secretly joins them. Mrs. Boynton makes enemies with everyone she meets. Including Lady Westholme (Lauren Bacall), Miss Quinton (Hayley Mills) and Dr. Sarah King (Jenny Seagrove). John Gielgud makes an appearance as Colonel Carbury.I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I do!"
3,"Peter Ustinov's last as ""Poirot"".","After the success ofDeath on the Nile(1978) andEvil Under the Sun(1982) and three tv-movies Thirteen At Dinner (1985-tv), Dead Man's Folly (1986-tv), Murder In Three Acts (1986-tv), Peter Ustinov returns as Belgian Detective, Hercule Poirot for the sixth and final time in this motion picture, Appointment With Death (1988). Piper Laurie is a wealthy, well-to-do woman at the reading of a will by her attourney (David Soul, original ""Starsky & Hutch"" tv series) of her dead husband. There are two wills. One will means less money to the widow and the step-children get an amount. In an act of blackmail, the attourney is forced to destroy one of the wills. Why does this woman put her ""medicine"" in a poison glass bottle. David Soul, the attourney, is having a romance with one of the widow's adult step-children. Cast also includes: Lauren Bacall, Carrie Fisher, John Gielgud, Hayley Mills (The Moon-Spinners), Jenny Seagrove, Nicholas Guest. Filmed in Israel, London and Italy."
3,Basic Fish Guide,"A nice book, but fairly basic. Some of the fish photos could have been better, but the kids enjoyed it."
1,slow boats - not speed boats,"I was very impressed when I opened this toy, but that didn't last. Our boats would go so slow on the full charge that they got stuck on the ""jump"" ramp and in the buoys. To make one of the boats go, we had to keep the controller no more than 8 inches from the boat. I am hoping that it's just defective boats. My boys really like the racetrack, but it's not fun to play with. Please post more reviews...I would like to know if anyone else had any problems.Thank you"
4,Very Interesting,"Although I have read other theories with which I agree more (evolutionary theories elaborated upon by Atran and Boyer), the Attachment Theory perspective is a very interesting point of view on how people form and maintain relationships with supernatural beings. The book as a whole makes some pretty persuasive arguments for the Attachment Theory and does it with humor and facts combined. For a subject that has great potential to be dry and boring, Kirkpatrick leads the reader through the points in a very fluid and entertaining way. Again, I really enjoyed this book, both as a Psych major and as a Philosophy & Religion major."
2,Not Up To Holt's Usual Standard,"As a big fan of Tom Holt I was rather disappointed in this novel.This is as funny as any of his other books but is somewhat lacking in characters. The main characters are Lucky George Faustus, who has escaped from Hell, and Kurt Lundqvist, the greatest bounty hunter of all time. The problem is that even after finishing the book the reader is still left with no direction as to which side they should root for. Is this a twist like in Bedazzled where the Devil is the good guy or are the characters just not defined enough? I don't know but the book was definitely missing something."
3,Tom Holt has no equals,"While not quite up to the 5-star standard of EXPECTING SOMEONE TALLER, FAUST AMONG EQUALS is certainly more than equal to the task of entertaining a reader for an afternoon. Holt's unique spin on theology, literature, and popular culture continues to be worth the price of admission to the ""Disney-meets-Dante"" theme-park ride contained between the covers of this novel."
1,Total rubbish,"Holt appears to be at the end of his rope - a paper-thin plot loaded with every pointless contrivance he could dream up. After the pleasure of ""Expecting Someone Taller"", ""Who's Afraid of Beowulf"", and ""Flying Dutch"" this proved a complete disappointment. It does not deserve the 1 star I was forced to give it. I would have better served reading the side-panel of a cereal box."
4,Funny and engaging,"Faust Among Equals is of the school of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy type of humor. It's not as good as HHGG, but that's asking a lot. It is, however, clever and quick, with wry references to Faust, Helen of Troy, and Hieronymous Bosch and lots of contemporary commentary (Australia doesn't come off too well). I listened to the book on tape and Simon Callow is so good at droll characterizations that I cannot imagine reading it myself. Well done."
2,Needs another edit,"Wow. I can't believe this novel not only got past an agent (assuming she has one and didn't self publish) but also an editor. The writing was horrible and amatuerish. For example: ""I walked into my dark apartment and turned on all the lights. I checked my answering machine--no messages. I flopped down on the couch and tried to tickle the elmo doll that now lived with me instead of my niece Ashley....That's when I decided. Karma be damned."" (shouldn't it be: That's when I decided--Karma be damned?)This is high school writing. My apologies if this is aimed at young adults, but I don't think it is. The story itself isn't that bad, but there is no character depth. Granted, most chick lit is neurotic and shallow, but this didn't even scratch that surface. Maybe the author needs to learn how to develop a voice by not using the first person. Too many ""I""s is not a good thing. Unfortunately, I don't have anything good to say about this book. I didn't HATE it, but didn't like it."
1,Do NOT waste your money!,"Thank goodness I only spent $2.99 on the Kindle version of this terrible book. I only read it to the end because I was hoping that the self-absorbed Julie would end up alone - because that is exactly what she deserved. Also, I'd love to do a word count of ""wannabe"" in this book! It was so over used it made me think that the author herself, is a wannabe. And Elmo? Come on."
4,Fun read!,"This book definitely falls under the ""chick-lit"" column. It's funny, honest and well written.I found reference to one of Ms. Orsoff's books in a discussion panel, followed the link & was pleasantly surprised. If you like light reads about women learning their way through life and love, you will enjoy this book. Great indie book!!"
1,BORING,I can't believe there were so many good reviews. I agree with all the 1 and 2 star reviews. long tedious and boring. there was nothing to her character and the dates were so stereotypical. stay away from this author most of her books drag on like this one.
2,Not so great,"There were some interesting moments in the book but totally predictable. I don't even mind predictable if it is written in a way that holds my attention, but I thought this book wasn't worth my effort of reading it."
1,Terrible!,"I cannot believe I am the first 1 star reviewer. This book is ridiculous! The author continually treats readers like we are stupid by putting lots of obvious explanations in after a thought or conversation. Dialogue is repetitive, for example, describing Greg as a kiss-ass three times to the same character or why Joe is a wannabe. Oh, and it's boring! Nothing exciting or salacious, just big chunks of paragraphs describing dinner, what she's wearing to dinner and of course, why none of the men are good enough for the annoying and stuck-up Julie. I thought the case about the assistant and his boss might be an interesting side story but nope, just a way to introduce us to another boring date."
2,Where is the story?,"I had high hopes for this book given the mostly positive reviews and the cheap price! But sadly, this book was a letdown. This book seems to lack a real substantial story. It's basically like, ""She goes on a date with this guy and this happened, then, she goes out with another guy and this is what happened...etc."" There's not really an interesting or captivating story being told."
4,Eyes Wide Shut,"Julie truly is romantically challenged. In her professional life she had all of her ducks in a row. In her personal life the clock is ticking and she feels the pressure to find a guy, get married and start a family from parents and friends.Julie, being highly logical, decides dating is a numbers game; the more guys you date the more likely it is that you will find Mr. Right. Although, after being burned from a long term relationship, she had raised her standards unrealistically high. I didn't like her much; she had become jaded, conceited, and shallow.Now Julie is in dating hell, she has become a serial dater. She is set up with blind dates, a dating service, and she even tries speed dating. Her dating disasters are hysterical. Ultimately, I am glad she didn't just settle. But she did soften and become a little more realistic when she finally opened her eyes.I just read the epilogue on Beth's web site and it should definitely be included in the book! Don't miss it!"
4,Excellent Read Until...,"This was an excellent, hard-to-put-down, riveting book, until you got to the end. It was as if the writer just got tired of the book, or became extremely lazy, and decided she just didn't want to finish it. There was no turning point, no resolution, nothing-- just, all of a sudden, ""the end"". The Kindle version has a note at the end saying that she put an epilogue on her website due to overwhelming complaint from her readers, but even that is unsatisfying. A great read, worth the money, but be prepared for the let down at the end."
5,Worth reading,Great book! Witty and funny! I couldn't stop reading it! An all around enjoyable book. Highly recommended and well worth purchasing.
2,Never caught my interest,"A single Jewish attorney sets out to find the perfect husband before she reaches 35.I couldn't get into the story. Nagging relatives and devoted losers aren't what I enjoy reading about. The characters were well-enough drawn, and certainly realistic, but uninteresting. I quit about halfway through."
2,romantically predicatable,"I did have high hopes for this ""romantic comedy"", but to be honest I didn't even laugh once.... This book was predictable in pretty much everyway: A 30 something, cute, entertainment lawyer living in LA,just wants to meet the one! The thing was that Julia the main character was a total and complete snot! She was so picky over in some cases the dumbest things! I found her to be so annoying and honestly the thing with the tickle me Elmo doll was just odd! This wasn't the worst book, but it wasn't the best either.... In most romantic type books your rooting for the ""heroine"", but I just wasn't rooting for Julia! I could see why she was single!"
4,Dating stories exposed!,"This was a funny chick-lit book! The dating stories of a single 30-something were hilarious and definitely rang true! All of her adventures, both good and bad, hit home and I really hope there is a sequel to this one! I want to know what happens next!"
3,I liked it - Good Chick Lit,I would recommend this book for those who like chick lit however I would search the free ebooks before you actually purchase this book. I have read better from the free chick lit selections on amazon. If you didn't have to pay for this book i would give it a better rating but since I have had the pleasure of reading from the free selections and have found better reads in this genre i have to say this book is ok. Not a terrible book and definitely one of the books that you would want to finish to the end but like I said there are better free selections out there.
4,Great Chick Lit!,"Romantically Challengedis great chick lit if you're looking for light reading and great entertainment.I really enjoyed this book--I found myself laughing out loud, especially when Julie's talking to Tickle Me Elmo. (So funny!)Julie is a lawyer who is single and looking for the ""right guy."" It's hilarious when she's out on her dates. Since Julie is a lawyer, it also dabbles a little into the legal profession, done very lightly.I would recommend this book to anyone woman who:1) loves chick lit2) is single and/or is dating (it's just so much funnier)3) looking for light reading4) wants to laugh5) is a fan of Sophie Kinsella or Emily GiffinThe kindle version is formatted very well, with little to no errors, but there's no TOC. Not a big deal for me.Overall, it's a great read, and I flew through this book in only a couple of days. It's well worth the read. Go ahead and pick this one up if you're a fan of chick lit. :)"
2,Predictable to the very end,"While I found this book enjoyable, it was fairly predictable. I know a lot of books are, but when I can predict almost the entire book AND be 100% right, well what's the point. I only finished the book to see how things would turn out with the guy it was VERY obvious she would end up with. All that being said, it was still a funny take on dating. Though if I was the character's friend, I would have had a hard time being diplomatic. She was kind of annoying."
3,Dating is a cruel thing.,"I really enjoyed the whole story line about a 32 year old single women in the dating world trying to find love. That I could easily identify and relate to. The actual personality of the main character Julie Burns, just got on my nerves. I think she was way to picky and didn't give some of the guys she wa sdating a chance. Sure, things like being too short and having HUGE nose hairs would be a turn off. Things like yelling at a waitress, may have been a one time deal. Maybe the guy had a bad day? I would have given him one more shot.Anyways, it was a good book, but like I said, I didn't like the main character as much as I could have."
2,Works great and seems identical to original - UPDATED,"Is the exact same size as the original switch. Can't beat the price and shipped to me fast. Highly recommended if your Dyson power switch won't stay ""stuck"" (on).UPDATE 1/9/12: This switch stopped working consistently. Now I have to mail it back for a refund. But it's not worth mailing since it cost $5. I guess I have to either just keep buying them until one works for more than a couple months, or find another supplier."
5,It fixed my vacuum,My dyson would not stay on when I pressed the on/off button. I replaced the switch on my Dyson DC14 with this one and now it turns on and stays on! I used a tutorial I found on sparesaver.
3,Installed in a snap,You will need torx head bits to take out a screw and an observant eye to know where to free things up to remove the cover plate and put slack in the power cord.No solder required for my install. Seems to work just fine.2012 update - still works great!
4,"Neo-Lounge-Pop of the first order.Dig the 'CD Enhanced,too!!","An excellent production which is actually their second release, ""Nice Set of Maracas"" was created over an extended period of time (as opposed to their self-released debut, which was recorded, essentially, over ONE weekend). The new record touches on many musical styles (blues, country, latin, the more vague sub-genre of 'lounge'), all showcasing the unique attitude and lyrics of the band and its frontman, Don Dazzo.This recording has just received a terrific review on BILLBOARD magazine (7/10/99)which you should check out. I'm sure they will continue to pick up more good notices for this CD and their wild live shows, where they usually mix their own tunes with unpredictable cover versions.Fans of such varied artists as CAKE, SMASHMOUTH, the Iggy/Bowie/Eno axis and, of course, forefathers like Louie Prima and Prez Prado should seek out Everlounge."
5,Perfect Fit O2 sensor!,Great O2 sensor! This was a perfect fit for my 1999 Tahoe. Great quality considering the price was half that of the local parts store I just do not see how you could go wrong. This is just one of the many parts for my vehicle I have started buying on Amazon. Most of the time you will find exact OEM parts for much less than parts stores. Great Stuff!
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!,"We got the house and accessories for our three year old over a year ago for Christmas and it hasn't lost it's appeal yet. Over the past year we were excited that when Dora became a big sister on her show the house came out with a nursery set with the twins. In addition, the new SUV was a big hit. I am hoping they continue to add to the set in the future, so far every new addition has been a hit. I would recommend this set to anyone with young children, boys or girls."
5,Chaser - Game On!,"The duo of Lars Sandberg (better known as Funk D'Void, purveyor of fine tech-house) and Nigel Hayes (known for his deep house & downtempo output) blend their sensibilities together on their Chaser project, of which Game On! is their first album. And what an album it is. It begins in definite downtempo territory, with the jazzy ""Sleazy Listening"" and the mellow, jaunty ""A Friend Like You"" and ""Blue Planet."" But by ""Everything Must Change"" arrives, everything does: the beats kick in, and we're treated to gems like ""Tall Stories"" and ""F-Train."" ""Life in Loisaida"" returns to the more relaxed side, but ""Sides of Iron"" gets back to the funky house part of things. My favorite track, ""Theme From Chaser,"" is deceptively simple: just a plucked bass and some synths, but it is incredibly memorable. The same goes for the rest of the album."

5,The Queen's Wrath,"This video is filled with excitement, adventure, suspense, and action. It contains the last four episodes of Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue. They are ""The Wrath of the Queen"", ""Rise of the Super Demons"", ""The Fate of Lightspeed, Part 1"", and ""The Fate of Lightspeed, Part 2"". Th Queen is furious with the civilians of Mariner Bay for building over her palace and creating their own city. Now she'll do anything to get her palace back. Even destroy. Mariner Bay's only hope is the Power Rangers. But will they be enough? Get this video to find out!"
1,Dansk Tjorn White Sugar Bowl,"This item was damaged in shipment by UPS and Amazon was unable to replace it. Amazon failed to notify us that UPS had returned it damaged, and by the time we learned of it and contacted Amazon, it was no longer available."
3,Mixed feelings about this play.,"""Much Ado About Nothing: With New and Updated Critical Essays and a Revised Bibliography"" starts out with a plethora of information regarding information about Shakespeare, Elizabethan theatre, the writing style, controversy if Shakespeare wrote his plays and if he contributed to others, etc. Then, the play begins, and this is where I wonder if I truly enjoyed the play. I began thinking if I liked the play itself, or because it was written by Shakespeare. Which then led to my thinking of whether it would be deemed such praise, if it hadn't been written by him, and I leans towards ""no."" The wit is somewhat dry, but the plot around Hero and Claudio caught my attention. It showed me how women were regarded as objects and how easily they can be discarded. And, how quickly men would believe any fault about a woman, without hearing her side of the story. Scary, in my opinion. Otherwise, it was interesting, but I don't know if I'd recommend it."
3,Probably not the best,"There are better translations out there. I would probably choose something else. This is readable, but it lacks the oomph that this play needs."
2,Price is right if it works,"I agree totally with the other two reviews about problems with both the length of the unit (I had to install in the lower DIN slot because it hit the firewall in the upper) and it does not resume the song where you stopped, you must start the track all over again once you resume. My unit had a hardware error after three months and would not play the memory cards. The factory did confirm the unit as defective and will replace it. It's good for the price but don't expect miracles or good quality control."
3,No Resume Play,"I often record tracks/files that have 2 hour or more of continuous music for MP3 playback. This unit does not have resume play. Therefore, each time I start the CD/MP3 after the power is off or I cycle through the modes (Tuner/AUX)it starts the track from the beginning. This is the only detractor from an otherwise superb unit."
5,Fun and imaginative,"Arthur Crandall and his wife are dogs who live on Crandall Street. One morning, a fly interrupts Crandall's usual burning of the breakfast toast. Crandall doesn't believe the fly is magic, and when offered three wishes in exchange for the fly's life, he makes some pretty crazy choices. This book plays on the time-tested theme: Watch out, or you may get what you wish for. There is a little tension in the book, but mostly the book is humorous and not too scary. Altogether, it contains about 800 words."
3,Burnt Toast on Davenport Street-- by: Tim Egan,"This book is truely original, and I do not think that there will be another like it. Arthur and Stella Crandall are two dogs that live a very simple life. One thing that is very familiar about their life is that every morning while Arthur is making breakfast, he burns the toast. One day, a magic fly flies in and promises to grant Arthur three wishes in turn that Arthur does not [swat] him. Arthur, not believing the fly, makes wishes that come into his head, and he doesn't really think about them. The wishes end up coming true, and you will never believe what happens to Arthur and Stella unless you read the book. My favorite character was Stella. I would recommend this imaginative story to anyone."
1,Lightbulb was great - too bad it was ONE!,Ordered the 6 pack of bulbs per website. Received one single bulb. Arrived in a box that was approx 3 feet x 1 foot along with a boatload of plastic bubbles....Had to go through the royal pain in the butt to figure out how to return the bulb and then needed to order more. Really? What a waste.
1,No words to describe my disgust,"I am still left wondering whose idea it was to name Russian songs of the criminal underground Gypsy songs. Perhaps, it is safer that way, and it attracts customers to at least listen to one of the songs. Being born in Russia, I have had enough exposure to criminal underground songs and culture to resent it with all my soul. This is not a good CD if you are looking for gypsy songs from Russia. If you are interested in Russian criminal underground songs sung by some drunk con - you are in for a treat. Thank you."
3,Did I miss something??,"I just watched this version of the TV Pilot. Ok, besides the few sprinkled f-bombs, I did not see anything to cause me to say ""Hey... ""I've never seen that"". It also says ""remastered""... from what? 16mm film? The video is still grainy, but considering when this was made, I won't hold it against them, but it sure doesn't look ""cleaned up"" or remastered from the master film. As to the ending, I could swear in the TV pilot they showed the ""lair"" where they keep Airwolf. In this new version it just flies back over the ocean towards home. If you already have the TV Pilot as part of Season 1, I don't see the need to add this to your collection."
5,Airwolf The Best,"One of the best shows out. Have it all on tape had to have it on disc.So much better than burning fropm tape to disc. Like the add on stuff. Does that tell you how much i Like it. Giving The Movie as a Gift. When this show first came out everyone wanted to own AIRWOLF. They even make scale models that fly. As the third season opening said,This can not be left in unenlighted hands. Guys took Airwolf from bad guy goverment type to help people.Yes glad I bought it."
2,A good movie ruined by European Language License Blaspheme and Vulgarity,"Airwolf The Movie was a really good movie right up until the very beginning of the film where they Blasphemed God's name over and over.This added absolutely nothing to the film as did the sexual vulgarity. Taking intimacy down to the ""Barnyard Gutter"" isn't a good written script nor good acting. Unfortunately European society and the American one following close behind have become or are becoming desensitized to bad behavior, bad life styles and bad language. Character matters here. The special effects were very good, unfortunately it was ruined with totally unnecessary negative attitudes and bad language that are either are to suppose to impress us or try to get us following the same bad examples. I no longer own the film as I would not have it in my house."
4,Enjoyable story...but...,"Enjoyed the story. Kept my interest all the way throught. Looking forward to reading more of her stories.Needs work on grammar, though. Too many ""I's"". Polish it up a bit and it would be a first rate piece of work."
1,Weak mystery,"Characters were likeable (except for murderer of course) but mystery was so weak it was ridiculous. Plus the police were portrayed as fools with no idea of police work. I saw a review dated 2002 ? thinking story was excellent, so perhaps we are now too knowledgeable for this author. Won't bother with another of her books even though it was a free download. Stupidities were just too annoying."
2,dangerous woman,This book was a fast read but it lacked any substance. I try to always finish any book I start but this one did not hold any interest for me...not enough of a real in-depth story line. Boring!!
3,a dangerous woman,Enjoyable light mystery. Kept my interest through to the end but a little too predictable for my liking. However I did like the fact that the crimes were not presented in a descriptive way.
2,Grammar!! COMMAS!!,"I think the book is fine. It has a creative enough plot and interesting enough characters but it reads like rough draft. It's in desperate need of editing. The author needs to brush on up on her colloquialisms and, more than anything, learn how to use commas!! It's a comma free for all. So distracting."
3,"Good, but not Great","This was a good book, but not a great one. I predicted the entire plot from about the second chapter. The main character, Fay, I couldn't somehow ever like. She seemed too harsh for my taste. Fay's relationship with Mitch was confusing. I kept asking if they were in a relationship or not. Description of the setting was good, though for some reason, I found the cat annoying. Use of first person worked for me, but it was not the best book I've read in first person and that knowledge stopped me some from liking it. There were numerous trivial editing mistakes, misplaced words and such, that should have been caught before publication. It's a strictly ""ok"" book useful to while away spare time, if you haven't something better to read."
2,Editor needed!,"I kept being pulled out of a fairly enjoyable book by the desperate need of a copy editor. These were not just errors caused, perhaps, by transition to digital. These were poor English! Continual misuse of pronoun case, convoluted sentences, and sentences which seemed to go nowhere. A professional editor is certainly worth the price!"
2,Doesn't live up to its potential,"I have to agree with another reviewer about this book. It's badly in need of editing, both for copy and for content. I too, had problems with a character who was supposed to be such a good editor/publisher using such terrible grammar. There is no mystery to the story; it's obvious ""whodunit"" very early on. The characters could have been much more interesting had they been developed; I could not get invested in them at all.The author also has several phrases of which she is inordinately fond, and she uses them way too often. The restaurant where the town gathers has no name and not much of a description; it is referred to as the ""local gossip corner"". Over and over. And although I did manage to make it to the end of this book, if I had seen the main character refer to herself as ""this old gal"" one more time, my kindle would have been in great danger of being thrown across the room.Two stars for a decent premise, minus three for execution. Glad it was free."
2,Very Little Mystery,"This was a free book for Kindle. And I am glad that I did not buy it because there was not much mystery for a mystery novel. The story revolved around a middle aged divorcee who owns the town newspaper. She is also a real nosy snoop. That is how she gets involved in the ""mystery"". I figured out who done it before the first quarter of the book was over. I also found the constant descriptions of the heroines various ankle sprains to be boring. If you want any romance there was NONE in this book."
3,Good deal,"Nice transaction, smooth and easy, got on time and what was decribed, exact what I expected, thank you so much!"
4,"Clever, Creative, And Expensive","I have loved all of the MaryJo McGraw stamping books that I've read. This is most likely my favorite. It is very creative. My favorite part about her books is that the cards actually look pretty, like something I'd want to duplicate myself. With other stamping books I didn't like the cards, and there was no way I wanted to use them as a guide even if their tecniques worked. Also the writing is fun and interesting, and not dull or preachy. My one problem with it is that to be able to make the cards you have to buy a lot of supplies. Overall the book in itself is very inspiring and worthwhile although it asks you to use many different supplies."
2,Making Greeting Cards with Rubber Stamps is a better book.,"I purchased this book after McGraw's other book, Making Greeting Cards with Rubber Stamps. I prefer the other book. This book had a couple of techniques that were interesting, but I didn't feel it was worth what I spent. I highly recommend the ""Making"" book instead."
2,Very little water flow,This pumps water flow is not impressive at all. Add a 1 foot tube and you just get a minimal flow with the pump flow fully open. Odd at it has all the exact same specs as the pump it replaced.
1,Does not hold cuffs tight enough,"Had to return, no retention on smith 100 cuffs. not worth the risk. though like design, definitely not functional enough."
3,turning it off is too cumbersome,"the device works, but it was difficult to figure out how to turn it off. I could not find in the instructions how to do it. I found the instructions to be very chatty and unclear. The first night my kid wore it, the alarm went off super loud, and i had to dismantle the entire thing to make it stop. the whole family woke up. I tried to return it, but returns are not allowed. Instead, I had to call and speak to a rep who told me how to turn it off. It should be as simple as pushing a button, but no. Once we learned how to turn it off, we were fine with it I guess."
4,Best in class but could be louder,"I have tried other products, and this alarm is certainly the best. When we first purchased it as a second alarm, as I have more than one child with bedwetting issues, my kids fought over it and refused to use any other product that we had in the house. They claimed that this was the most comfortable of them all. I ended up having to buy another one to stop the pre-bedtime arguing over who would get the ""purple"" alarm.They work well and with time we certainly saw a vast improvement in the bedwetting. My only complaint is that I wish they were louder. While they are loud enough to wake the wearer up ( and the vibration helps) at the beginning it is useful if the parent can also hear the alarm to assist the child, and we couldn't hear the alarm from our bedroom. Setting up a baby monitor in the children's room helped to solve that problem though."
3,works while it works,"This alarm made a huge difference at first for my 7 year old. From wet sheets to small wet patches in the underwear in about 5 days. Unfortunately, four months later we are still fighting with the small patches, and now the ""Easy-clip"" has broken. I was watching my son undo it (I currently sleep in a bed next to his to help him wake up quickly to the alarm) and he was not being rough, or doing anything strange. Unfortunately, the clip is not warranteed by the manufacturer. The Bedwetting Store warrantees them for three months which is nice, but won't help us. So you might want to factor in an extra $27 for having another clip sent to you in the middle of training, or pick another manufacturer. Palco Labs has a Wet-Stop2 that looks very similar, but I haven't tried it."
5,I Love It,"I love this product. Light weight and easy to use. Very reliable. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
1,"If bad actors don't compel, how can a muppet?","This show, while interesting in concept, plays like a really bad version of comic book superheros, the starjammers...and the acting is poor, even for genre television...though at least it's better than the muppet acting. If 99% of human beings are bad actors, and bad acting ruins shows, why do they keep thinking MUPPETS can act well enough to keep you in the story? Yeeesh."
3,Poor transfer to DVD,"Others have reviewed the show; this is to review the DVD itself. The previous three seasons of Farscape on DVD have looked fantastic for the most part, but these discs suffer from severe compression artifacts. I don't know what ADV has done differently, but unfortunately it really shows. In some scenes the compression is so great that the entire frame ""refreshes"" only at half-second intervals, giving the whole picture a sort of stop-action appearance. Look at Disc 2, ""Lava's a Many Splendored Thing"", at disc time 34:58-35:01. The clouds in the background just jerk across the scene. And at 36:15-36:20, where Scorpy and John are talking, the entire frame just jerks forward at those same half-second steps. What puzzles me is that excerpts from these same shows in the Special Features (Behind the Scenes with Rebecca Riggs) appear with much greater clarity, color, and realism, and without compression artifacts. What's going on here, ADV? A disappointing set of discs."
1,Great Movie!,"Great movie, I have not seen this in years and wish I could see it now!This dvd will not play on my player."
4,"Before "" i dream of Genie ""","Here we have some great light entertainment for the whole family. Ourmain character finds a bottle with a genie inside,, need i say more ..Saw this movie as a kid, and enjoying it everytime they showed it on TV.They should get this movie to DVD a.s.a.p. cause i dont see it on tvtoo much anymore.Very enjoyable, good for multiple viewings."
1,DVD are defective,"I would love to see this movie, unfortunately i have ordered it twice and both times the first half of the movie is missing and no main menu, it just starts playing in the middle of the movie. So i'm just getting a refund and maybe i will try again when they get their product working properly.Very disappointed."
5,Great family movie,"This is a very enjoyable, old fashioned, funny and quick paced family comedy. I remembered seeing it when I was young and I really enjoyed watching it again. It is as funny as I remembered and well worth watching!"
5,The Brass Bottle,"I saw this as a young teen, and the humor and crispness was not just a memory. This was and remains a delight to view. Complete with laughs and small bits of wisdom. If you enjoy Doris Day / Rock Hudson comedies of this period, our sure to enjoy this Randall / Eden film. I have never understood why it is not a staple of networks like TCM."
4,The Brass Bottle,"I remember watching this movie as a child and just thinking this was a really funny and totally cool movie. I thought I remembered only bits and pieces, but I had remembered so much more than I realized. It is a cute movie and for its day (and even now) was very well done. I laughed at all the antics like I did when I was a child. Even if your child is use to movies of today, your young child will enjoy this movie."
5,Best tasting,These are the best tasting cough drop I've ever found. They don't have that medicine-like taste. They're like candy.
3,Taste normal but look strange,I love to have my Ludens cough drops around when I get a tickle in my throat at work. These taste normal and are within the expiration date but the looked old. Instead of being bright red they were more opaque pink. Not sure if it is simply the coloring or these were exposed to temp extremes?
2,A bad edition for a good book,"I've been very disappointed by this edition of Manuel Garcia's thoughts. The edition is not very clear, with continuous mistakes in spelling that, in certain parts, makes it really difficult to understand. It needs urgently someone to revise and correct all the misprints."
3,Too many good versions of these two Symphonies to mess with,I just really want to talk about the sound quality of this recording. I have an excellent car cd deck and this sounds super dull without the crisp highs like I always like to hear. I also like to hear the fourth played at more spacious speeds (like Christopher Hogwood does) than this particular recording. Maybe if I had one of those Super Audio cd decks this could be much better sounding but I doubt it. I think I might be done with Mr.Vanska.
3,What's all the fuss?,"First off, let's acknowledge that these recordings are good. But with literally dozens of choices out there, I just don't see how they rise to the top. Maestro Vanska is perfectly capable in these works, and his interpretation is fine. The orchestra is in fine form, too. But nowhere do I hear anything ""special"" -- which these forces certainly are capable of delivering in the concert hall and on CD (listen to their Grieg Peer Gynt selections and you'll hear what I mean).Actually, Minneapolis has experienced better performances of these two symphonies in the past -- and we have the record to prove it. Antal Dorati waxed them with the orchestra for Mercury Living Presence back in the mid-1950s ... those interpretations really ARE noteworthy."
4,Blood and Magic,"This strategy guide for Blood and Magic is a great guide to beginners who just don't get it and are finding it to hard. When I had just got this game I did find it challenging so I found some cheats but they didn't work. That was my last hope of ever beating this game until I heard about this guide. It helped me past all the levels and stories. It is a really great book, but some parts might be a little to hard to understand for kids, but overall it's a very great and helping book."
3,Chicken Little writes a book....,"Not a bad book by any means, eloquently writting, well researched, and Dixon often adds a well fit personal perspective and experience to his points. Still there just does not seem to be anything new here, large parts read like a pessimistic first year course in Earth Sciences or Economics, mosty of the ""clear cutting is bad"" variety. Beyond that, and the admitted ""well duh!"" premise of the book itself, little else stands out as anything more then speculative musings of the author that do not follow from the evidence he presents to any conclusive degree."
2,Remind me what the point was?,"I this book had a point, I missed it.Yes our world is full of complexity and unpredictability. And yes, we tend to overrate our ability to compensate for those traits. That shouldn't be a surprising revelation to thoughtful people.I liked a few things such as the notion of a ""fitness landscape"".I quickly got tired of the climate change message. I'm not a doubter or disbeliever. I just think the author spent so much time on environmental issues that I lost focus on the message of the book.I suggest you skip this one."
3,Not bad:,"Thundercade is one of those game you'll play a few times and most likely just kinda forget about it. Everything is pretty average. This plays like your typical scrolling up down shooter only here, you speed along on a motorcycle. You can collect various sidecars that power up your attacks but really none of them are as useful as they should be. The controls feel really sluggish and just don't feel as natural and responsive as they should be. The graphics are pretty sour as well, you can identify everything for what it is but everything is very bland and unfinished looking. Another annoyance are the bosses. When you hit them, they don't flash or do anything to really indicate that you've inflicted damage on them at all. The game is very short too, consisting of too few levels which is really a mixed blessing as once you complete it, you'll never play this again. It's not terrible but I would recommend Jackal or Commando first as those are both similar but with much more depth."
1,studying for the RNC exam,"I bought this book in anticipation of helping me prepare for the RNC exam, and it really didn't help me. the practice test questions were often poorly worded and it was difficult to figure out what the question was really asking. there was no explanation for the various answers and if you didn't know the answer there was no way to understand the rationale for their ""correct"" answer. I disagreed more than once with the book's answer and found it frustrating to not be able to read why they picked a particular answer. I also found that some of the information in the book was no longer the standard ie keeping the babies NPO for 12 and 24 hours..... I found the Core Curriculum for Maternal-Child Nursing to be far more helpful in preparing for the exam. save the $23 on this book and put it towards the $69 book that has much better information."
5,Perfection,"As NJ was the epicenter of the Rev. War, Somerset Co. was the epicenter of all the action in NJ. Truly the crossroads of the War.Some of these Arcadia local history books are better than others, and William Schleicher's are all among the very best. A gifted historian and writer (see his journal articles on Samuel Sutphin for example), he has spent 30 years absorbed in Somerset County history. As long-time head of the local historical society, and Rev. War collector and reenactor, he was uniquely qualified for this task. And it shows. A must have for anyone living near Somerset County, anyone involved in one of the many ancient churches, anyone with genealogical interests in the region, or any Rev War buff. Especially fun to introduce your children to the local history.If you live in Somerset Co., buy an extra copy for your church or public library."
5,Tre Bien!,"Fantastic! I have no idea what the heck these folks are singin' about, but frankly it doesn't matter... I love it! Upon first listen, it would be easy to dismiss this album as just one of hundreds crammed into the ""world"" or ""international"" section at the music store. However, play it at least twice and I guarantee you'll be hooked. I found the album to be an unexpected blend of a variety of musical styles. The pace is quick, with brief breaks of slow, sometimes haunting tracks. My one year old daughter loves dancing to it; ""M'Bifé balafon"" gets her going and by ""Camions Sauvages"" she is in full swing with no hope of stopping her! To summarize, fantastic!"
4,The Indestructible Beat Of Mali,"30 years on, and legends in West Africa, blind couple Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia have their commercial comeuppance in the other-than-world-music sphere, and I am not egotistical or hip enough to admit that you can count me in that group of neo-fans. What I did discover upon the solid recommendation of a sage-in-the-woods is an extraordinary juxtaposition of rhythm and glorious melody and gargantuan beats and a conviction that only 30 years of love could muster. The great Manu Chao produces with a pristine knowledge and his variegated patterns illuminate the vocal while the whole thing effervesces into an explosion of infectious tunes. Believe the hype. My grade: A"
5,Feel Good Music,"This is our first Amadou and Mariam album, but we have quite a few other albums of African music. This album is extremely accessible to the Western ear, in part due to the production of Manu Chao, but also because of the engaging rhythms and beats, and of course the singing. Looking forward to purchasing more Amadou and Mariam albums!"
4,ersatz,"Manu Chao somewhat overshadows this production by the excellent husband and wife team of Amadou and Miriam. While at most times his production flourishes invigorate these procedings, the canned village noises detract. It's not a live disc -- so it doesn't benefit from crowd noise. It becomes very much a manneristic production piece, not the more organic outpouring that was ""Tje Ni Mousso."""
5,I think there's something to this,"Well, I won't say it did, but I won't say it didn't save my live. I was in the hospital for several days and finally the doctor told me that only about 10% of my liver was functional. He prescribed a lot of stuff for my pancreas and other things but there wasn't anything for liver. Nonetheless, my blood work was getting better. That's when I started taking this Liver Gaurd. I had an appointment to talk to the liver transplant surgeon and he said that there was a good chance I'd have to have a transplant even though my liver function had improved somewhat. I've had several appointments since then and there was improvement. Well, I'm taking these pills whether they had anything to do with it or not. After 5 months I can't get on the transplant list anymore."
4,A talented artist reaching out to undiscerning listeners,"Anup is a talented artist with a light-hearted approach to complex and demanding music. I think he has weakened his music by providing a background thump-a-rump to catch the ear of those who would otherwise ignore a more classical Indian sitar style. Perhaps for this I should have ranked the release a 3 but overall the quality is high and the cause is kind.Admiringly, you can feel his cheer and it is a joyful atmospehere he kneads, something like when Stevie Wonder plays his harmonica."
2,Lacks info on how to lead and execute the moves,First off the use of multiple camera angles is quite helpful and is a feature that should be used for every learn how to dance video. However beyond that a key and essential part of Salsa is missing here - how to lead each move. There is no way to use the DVD alone with its instruction and become proficient at leading. For this reason I think this DVD is not a good purchase.It is also worth noting that this is Miami or Cuban Style Salsa - make sure that is what people dance in your area before you potentially waste money on this DVD.
2,"Misleading, but good marketing","I've taken dance lessons from a variety of instructors, and what I saw on this DVD is unlike anything that I've learned. This is not a good thing. This DVD doesn't really cover all of the basic moves one would expect a DVD for beginners should cover. It covers some basic steps and then launches into intermediate moves. Also, the man in the DVD is not very skilled. It looks as though he was pulled off the street and given a crash course in salsa, and not a very good course at that. As a DVD for beginners, it gets two stars. If it were for intermediate students, I would give it three or four. As for the DVD's marketing campaign, I give it five. It suckered me."
1,bad cuban salsa,"I didn't like this video. It's purely cuban salsa. The instructors aren't mastering basic dance principles. Technically speaking, very poor. The only good thing about this video is the way they introduce the different camera angles.Improvin'always"
1,bad basics and fake names,"I was very unimpressed with this DVD. Yes, the video was filmed well and worked well with the multiple angles. But the dancing was very confusing. The basic step is backwards from anything I've ever seen and I've been dancing for 5 years in the U.S. and Latin America. And they made up ridiculous names for each move. All in all, the DVD was useless and pointless. There are a lot of good dance instruction DVD's out there and this is not one of them."
1,Look elsewhere!,"Do NOT buy this DVD if you want to learn how to dance salsa properly. I can tell just from the preview that these two are definitely not dancers. They have horrible technique, don't know how to count music, and have no feeling. They're not even wearing dance shoes! As a salsa instructor, I strongly encourage anyone who is trying to learn how to dance to look elsewhere!"
2,One style of salsa,"This is the one style of salsa that I don't like. See for yourself. The female instructor did a quite good job, compared to other salsa instructional DVDs out there. But still this is salsa done ugly."
4,"The Quick and Dirty Guide to Salsa - Part 1, Beginners","Great product - went I first purchased this product I thought it just salsa, but later learn it was casino rueda and I was equally excited. Thank you Gigi and Pedro for putting out a great product."
2,Male beginners watch out,"Like another reviewer mentioned, Gigi doesn't pay attention to leading at all whichfrom a male point of view is terrible. You might learn the moves but you have no idea howto lead the woman.So for men I don't consider this a good beginner dvd. It's veryimportant to learn how to lead properly.Personally I didn't like the fact that all the names of the moveswere repeated so often. It was really distracting and although itmight be nice to know the names it isn't really helpful since every salsateacher seems to use a bit different terminology."
4,Good instructional video for beginners!!,"My wife and I found this video VERY helpful and a lot of fun!! We had taken salsa classes at the local high school before but they really didn't work for us. Having the dvd works much better for us. Now we practice a couple times a week for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours and we have improved significantly. The different angles and the ability to replay each new step is great. The only issue we have is that in some of the later more complex steps, a little more instruction could be given, but by watching it a couple of times we eventually get it. We are definitely going to order Part 2. We also have the dvd on our potential gift list for couples!"
4,Excellent instruction (but a little annoying),"I really liked this DVD. The clear and simple way the steps are broken down makes them really easy to learn, even the complicated steps seem easy.The only reason I don't give this a 5 star rating is because the way Gigi talks is a bit annoying (at least to me). Also, Gigi and her parnter haven't quite mastered english grammar. For example Gigi says : ""Now take the other girl's hand"", when it should have been ""take the girl's other hand"".Other than that, this DVD is excellent, I have bought part 2 because I liked the first one so much."
5,How I learned to dance Salsa,"Knowing the type of person I am I would never go to a class. I also wanted to surprise my girlfriend, so I decided to learn in Private. I didn't have much confidence when I first got this DVD, but I was incredibly pleased that it actually worked and worked well. I took my girlfriend to an open Salsa night at a hot spot in NY without telling her that I had been using Dirty Salsa for a couple of weeks. My Girlfriend actually thought I had been taking lessons in Private and didn't believe that I had learned from a DVD when I told her. Now we go every weekend to a different hot spot as we have become regulars. I'm not a big fan of ""How To's"" but this one is definitely a keeper. Anyone who actually wants to learn Salsa , this DVD will definitely do the trick. I especially liked the three camera angles which made the learning more dynamic. I would recommend the DVD to any of my friends who want to learn Salsa. A+"
1,really dumb,I hate this cd because I don't want everybody to buy it so I can put the review down some
5,One of the finest punk/ska albums ever,"I'm not a huge fan of punk or ska, in fact I only really like AFI and Boy Sets Fire besides Choking Victim. I usually find the whole genre soaked in an overabundance of mediocrity and unoriginality (just like what's becoming of nu metal) they mix several different genre's of music and like Mr. Bungle they mix perfectly. A little ska, punk, hardcore, reggea, death metal, and even lounge are the main ingredients included on No Gods/No Managers. The lyrics range from Athiesm, Politics, Satanism (very funnily done too I might add), and Stealing. Creating some of the funniest (Suicide, Crack Rock Steady, and 5 Finger Discount) songs I've ever heard and some best true punk anthems (War Story, F*** America, 500 Channels) I've ever heard.While they were great, they have broken up and have formed a new band called Leftover Crack and have an album out now on Hellcat. Definatly pick that up too if you like Choking Victim."
4,Choking Victim,Imagine if Op Ivy had a love child with Anti-Schism and Old Rudimentary Peni. This cd is pretty good. Got that Op Ivy ska punk feel with vocals and socio-political squater Marxist rhetoric punk rock that we loved so much from Anti-Schism and RP. I think they try to hard to associate themselves with squat punk... they are on HellCat Records (ie Epitaph) so you have to lose lots of street cred right there. You should buy it.
3,Great Album,"The Album was great only thing wrong was one song on side B skips at a certain part and I know its not my record player as it does not do that with any of my other records.other then that,Fast shipping little damage to album corners in shipping process."
4,Interesting challenging story of outstanding sports figure,"A great biography! A great cricket player who gave his life whole-heartedly to the Lord and was greatly used by Him. I don't know much about cricket, but I like sports, and really enjoyed and was challenged by this book!"
2,"Great man,lousy book","The book C.T.Studd by Norman Grubb is a 222 page book about this great man of God who gave up a promising sports life to serve the master.His faith to be a multiple country missionary is a profound testimony to his faith.He seems slightly charismatic as he frequently speaks of recieving the Holy Spirit after salvation.This book gets 2 stars from me because of the way it,s written not the life of the man.The book seems to jump around a lot and not be very ""readable"" at least to me, I had such a difficult time reading this bio that I only finished half of the book--thats something I never do.Want this mans bio ??--get another one about him,not this one."
3,See how they grow- insects,"I bought this to show to my first grade class. They thought it was rather babyish, but they still liked it, even though it had spiders (not insects in it). The metamorphosis process of butterflies was the best part. I'd recommend this to preschoolers fascinated with bugs, but that's about it."
4,like waking up one day to the rain?,"I love ivan klima's way of writing.of this book, which i strongly recommend to any czech author readers and ivan klima fans, i loved the last stories and i simply adored ""the white house""-the stories in this book are of... yes, love. but not only love- chance meetings, night trysts, and death, yes, as well.though some stories will hold you with their enchantment of love... others will falter you with their blunt reality of love.all in all you can expect to find in these stories what you find in your own life. a little of enchantment, a little of sadness, a little of passion, a little of numbness."
1,Bad fit,These screw covers did not fit the screws that I purchased at the same time and were matched with each other.
1,THIS COMPANY IS A RIP OFF,WANTED 4 COVERS FOR THE FRONT AND 4 FOR THE BACK PLATE..ENDED UP WITH 32 BUT THAT WAS OK AS THEY WERE 1CENT PER PACK OF 4..TOTAL COST 8 CENTS..THE COMPANY CHARGED ME $39.92 IN SHIPPING !!! THEY WEIGHED NOTHING AND BARELY GOT HERE FOR CHRISTMAS. WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN AND WILL NOT RECOMEND THEM TO ANYONE..
1,Too Bad,These were a massive waste of time and money. They cracked just trying to put them on. Don't bother!
1,Cheap plastic- waste of money!,Made of a very cheap plastic. Didn't fit the screws I had which weren't wide at all. I can't even give them away because no one I know has screws small enough for them to work. Waste of money!
1,Chrome These Are Not,"While they will serve the purpose, they are as plastic as can be and plastic ain't chrome in America! Here's the link to them so you can see for yourself that it says, ""Cruiser Accessories 82030 Screw Covers, Chrome"". http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032KC30 I already had some of these on there but I thought these were chrome and that is the only reason I ordered them. It's too much trouble to return them so I'll give them away or use them on another vehicle. But I'd appreciate if the distributors at Amazon would actually tell the truth. There is nothing wrong with them so I hate to rate them low but I'm doing that as it was very misleading."
1,Very dissatisfied!,"Very dissatisfied. The covers did not fit the current screws that are on my BMW license plate. If your considering this product, please make sure it will fit you'r car."
3,On my Tag plate,"I found out I didn't really need it, but I decided to keep it anyway,someone I know may need these."
1,"Cruiser Accessories 82030 Screw Covers, Chrome","While searching for a Chrome License Plate Frame w. Clear Cover, we were made to understand that we needed this item in order to install the License Plate Frame."
3,Kind of OK.,"First, I love natural products. But it didn't cover my gray hair at all. I will keep using this henna( I can't returun them) but I have to do every ather week I guess.So my hair is very thick , hard hair. I want to use only cover of my hair roots top pf my head area. I had stay 2hours which I thought enough to cover such a small area. But it did n't work, my roots get dark green cooler,,,,.How embarrassed to go out public. I will try some reviewer idea that I hope work for me.Smell was good - green, leafy smellNo chemical at all."
4,"Messy, ok coverage, no red!","I followed the directions in the package (hot water, henna, and some olive oil)...I let it stay 2 hrs and then rinsed with some conditioner. With my long hair, the application was a mess! The mixture came apart easily and fell everywhere - sink, counter, and floor! A little got on my hand, which discolored the area. I was disappointed with the coverage on the gray hair and had to apply the henna again in the area I have the most grays (20 -25% gray). The second application was more successful. Perhaps, I will try the other reviewer's recommendation next time. This product did take the redish color out of my hair and it made it look healthy and shiny. I would rate this product 3 1/2 stars!"
2,Warning: Earpiece NOT compatible!,"I don't know about the e315 or e316 phone models, but I do know that the handsfree earpiece is not compatible with the e317 phone. While the package might be worth buying just for the carrying case and the car charger, keep in mind that you might not be able to use the earpiece if your phone is like mine."
1,wrong headset type for e317,"just FYI -- unless i'm mistaken, this headset is *not* compatible without an additional (i.e. not included) adapter.-ewee"
2,1 out of 2 were right not bad but still disappointed,"i ordered 2 seperate starter kits the one for my wife was right but the one for me was the wrong phone. besides the leather cases are ugly and loose,the ear pieces have alot of static but still work haven't tried the car charger because after the first 2/3's of the kit were half assed i'm scared the car might not start after i use it, but the kit was only 10 dollars so i guess you get what you pay for"
5,Fortune can turn another wedding...into a CELEBRATION!,"This CD is just a sample of FORTUNE'S extensive song list which also includes titles from swing, motown, rock and pop. Julian and the gang are the real deal, they sound just like the original artist and nothing like a typical wedding band...not to mention it's just great music. Julian & Fortune have captured a sound that can't help but make you feel great while listening to these songs...you'll love this performance."
1,songs of celebration,"I am desperately searching for a song for mother & son, and none of these CD's allow you to hear any of those songs? Im not going to buy something i can't hear first, so this was very useless"
1,Disappointing,"I wish I had been able to hear some selections from this CD before ordering, because I could have saved myself some money. I went by the other reviews and I am very disappointed. The words to the some of the songs are pretty, but the whole thing sounded like it was ""homemade"" by amateurs. I know my opinion is quite different than most that have submitted a review, but I feel I have wasted...and don't even have a desire to listen to it for a second time."
2,"A nice sampler, poorly performed","There are a number of fine songs on this CD, but the performances are surprisingly unprofessional. I was very disappointed by the quality of the CD."
5,THIS CD IS SIMPLY WONDERFUL!,"THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST CD'S I HAVE LISTENED TO IN A VERY LONG TIME. JULIAN AND THE FORTUNE BAND ARE UNBELIEVEABLE. I HAVE SEVERAL FAVORITES ON THIS CD, BUT ""I BELIEVE IN YOU AND ME"" AND "" I NEED TO BE WITH YOU"" ARE TRUELY MY FAVORITES. JULIANS RENDITION OF "" I BELIEVE IN YOU AND ME"" IS BEUTUFUL. THE WAY JULIANS VOICE CHANGES IN THIS CD IS REMARKABLE. THAT MUST BE WHY HE IS CALLED THE MAN OF 1000 VOICES! THE BACK ROUND MUSIC AND VOCALS ARE UNBELIEVABLE IT MAKES THE WHOLE CD COME TOGETHER. IF YOU ARE PLANNING A WEDDING OR JUST A ROMANTIC NIGHT AT HOME THIS IS THE CD TO LISTEN TO. ALTHOUGH I HAVE PUT THIS CD ON FOR A HOUSE FULL OF PEOPLE AND THEY LOVED IT. SO REALLY IT IS A CD FOR ANY OCCASION."
4,"The Cat, before he went ""smooth""!","Gato's first US recordings were with leaders of the N.Y. ""free jazz"" avant garde in the late '60's, (Don Cherry, Carla Bley) and his use of ""screech"" tones in the high end of his horn's range concealed an essentially romantic conception. By ""Phenix"" he had gotten more comfortable in bringing Latin American concepts, and instrumentation into his music; on Phenix, he flirts with electric instruments (guitar, bass, and Fender Rhodes piano) as well.The result is intense, yet, in places, almost too ""pretty"" for an avant garde player. Within a couple of years, after a group of albums for Impulse in Latin America, and the ""Last tango"" soundtrack, he'd suddenly gone ""smooth"". But that was later..."
2,this book isnt half as good as the first!,i was very disapointed with this book! i thought it would be as well written as the forest wife(one of my very favourite books) instead child of the may seemed forced and it rushed along at a dizzying pace. also i truly came to hate magda! she seemed so spoiled and fake. all and all this book isnt really worth buying except for young children who might like it. ages 4-6
3,Works on 3 out of my 4 tires,"This gauge works on 3 of my tires. On the 4th tire, it cannot depress the valve so it cannot take a reading (another gauge works on this tire). When it works, pressing the bleed button causes the air to very slowly leak out, but the gauge needle does not move when the air is bleeding. It shows the new pressure after the button is released, so I have to press, release, check, press, release, check, press, release, check ..."
1,Not very encouraging,"I don't own this product, and after reading this listing I'm fairly certain I never will. I'm supposed to trust my valuable documents to a company that would allow such a poorly written ""product features"" statement to appear online? No, thanks!"
1,"Rust, use plastic hardware",I used a set of these. They hold water and rust out the hardware. Luckily I had some screw extractors so I was able to take my plate off with a little work.
3,Gets the job done,"They feel cheaply made, but mine snap on pretty tight and match the my license plate frame well enough."
4,good cd,"it was a good cd, not the best, but it was ok, for 3.98, it was worth it, go ahead and buy this one."
2,It depends on your personality,"If you like to curl up with volume of beautiful, rambling prose, then this is the book for you.If you grow impatient with an author who takes 9 pages to discuss an idea that could comfortably fit into 2 - 3 paragraphs, then you should look for a different book. The writing style reminded me of Charles Dickens, who reportedly was paid by the word.Yes, the book is beautifully written, but I simply lost patience with it. I also found it to be a bit preachy, as if the author believes herself to be the only one who knows the joy of simply being in a garden, observing all of its wonders, and must teach it to the rest of us morons. (I'm a bit sensitive to preachiness, however, and the average reader might disagree!)It all depends on your personality."
5,Touches the Heart...,"In this touching work I was captivated by the depth of human understanding McGreevy sprinkled with humor that makes you laugh with you soul. A wonderful book- I have already passed it on to my family, a real gift that we will share with our families to come... Bravo! I hope to read more works from this budding author in the near future!"
3,Didn't like the metal nose.,"I used this nailer for nailing prefinished cherry crown molding. The metal tip tends to put a mark in the wood. The metal tip makes it hard to secure the nailer to the curve part of the crown molding. The tip will sometime slide across the wood as I try to position the nailer. This ends up scratching the wood. The nailer tends to gouge the wood if not shot perpendicular to the wood. This could be an issue if you were using it on something that can be inspected closely. If this nailer had a ruber tip, I would probably give it 5 stars. The nailer sinks the brads nicely, and the depth is easy to adjust. The weight and balance is also nice. It's a quality tool with one fatal flaw. I really wanted to like this nailer, but will probably return it."
4,What people need to remember....,"This product DOES work if you are otherwise healthy and your hairloss isn't genetic or caused by an underlying medical condition. It could HELP in those cases, but chances are your results won't be great.Also, if you have a condition like a candida albicals overgrowth which stops proper assymilation of nutrients, this can also have a great affect on whether or not they work.I lose hair when I'm stressed. When I'm taking these I notice this doesn't happen and my hair loss in the shower is about 10 hairs. When I'm not taking them it can be up to 40. Yes, I've actually counted the hairs left in the comb!!They also make my actual hair strands thicker and they seem more rooted and strong in the scalp.Anyway, don't let the nay-sayers discourage trying this product.I would have rated this product 5 stars if it weren't so expensive."
5,It Worked,"I am one to be reluctant to buy anything even though others may say it could be a great/lousy product. Everyone is their own person; we have our own body chemicals; items, such as this, work differently for each individual. With Hair Formula 37, I noticed the hair of a woman I worked with grew very fast; whereas, mine and my daughter's grew not as fast. The outcome, we were satisfied, not only with the growth, but with the texture and shine."
3,Expensive,"This product is very expensive for what you get. I was hoping that I would see some improvement in my hair growth but I did not! Sadly, it grew at the same rate as it always has...although it is a great shampoo and conditioner...it didn't do what I wanted it to do."
3,On the fence,"I received the product, and was saddened that the bottles of shampoo and conditioner were damaged and half the product was already gone. I did use the remainder which only lasted about two weeks. I did notice some difference in the texture of my hair and it was more shiny. I was slightly confused on how to take the vitamins. I received 1 bottle of step one and 2 bottles of step 2. I do not know that I will purchase again, as I have still have no luck contacting customer service about half the product being gone, and it is very expensive... ????"
2,Decent.,"I haven't noticed much hair growth really, but my hair looks and feels healthier. I'm only had way through it but ill continue to use it i suppose to see if it gets any longer."
3,NOT SURE ABOUT THESE,I did use these as much as I could bare but just the fact that you have to swallow so many large pills got a bit much for me to take. I did use it for about a month but I can't say I notice any difference in my hair since it was already a good shoulder lenght but my nails did seem to grow a bit stronger and a bit longer but nothing outrageous.
4,Panasonic Microwave Oven.,Easy to use and easy to keep clean. Stainless steel finish is attractive in the kitchen. Replaces a GE model that gave many years of dependable service.
3,Large microwave oven but bad controls,"We bought this microwave oven in July 2007. The dial for setting time is not very intuitive. A key pad would have been better In the last two weeks the dial used for setting time for cooking became less sensitive and today Jan 2010, it died completely. I had to replace the fuse. Removing the hexagonal screws took some effort as they seem to be non-standard size."
1,Why am I surprised?,"I liked this microwave in every way except when it stopped working in less than a year's time. Rather than taking my chances with repairing it, I bought another one. When the second one died within a year as well, I realized I can only blame myself. I've consistently had bad results from Panasonic over the years, whether it was a phone, television, or 2 microwave ovens. This isn't the first time I've told myself I'd never buy from them again. Seriously. Someone needs to slap me if I ever buy another product from Panasonic, no matter how appealing or convenient it appears to be."
1,When it works...,I probably saw John from Denver's microwave in the same shop that I had mine in. Because any of the 3 times that mine has been in the shop I have seen 3 to 5 of the same model in the shop. I have never had a microwave fail on me. They often get given away to someone or thrown out still working. The opening latch on this microwave gave out after 7 months. After 13 months the magnatron tube went out. That cost me $65 for labor under the 3 year parts/no labor warranty on the tube. Then after 20 months the latch broke again. That cost me almost $100 to fix as it was out of warranty. The next time it's going in the trash. DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE!!!!
5,One of the all time greats,"With Schwarz-Bart, Joseph Conrad and Henryk Sienkiewicz, I can be convinced that the greatest writers are all Polish. I started this book many times as a teenager, and found it too painful to read. When I finally allowed myself to read the whole thing, it took up permanent residence in my heart. I am thrilled that it is being reprinted."
5,4 YEAR OLD LOVES THIS STORY!,MY 4 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVES THIS STORY. MY HUSBAND & I LOVE NODDY AS MUCH A MY GRANDSON. NODDY IS A GREAT TEACHING ROLE MODEL FOR CHILDREN. I RECOMMAND ALL THE BOOKS AND CDS AVAILABLE FOR CHILDREN IN THIS SERIES LINE.

4,+ 1/2 stars...A Christmas Album to Enjoy Year 'Round,"I first encountered Al Di Meola as the lightning-fingered guitarist for the fusion group Return to Forever and later on solo albums like ELEGANT GYPSY and SPLENDIDO HOTEL. But on WINTER NIGHTS, he is in a more subdued mood. Many of the tracks feature Ukrainian musician Roman Hrynkiv on bandura, a folk instrument similar to a lute. The two perform together to marvelous effect like on the Di Meola original ""Zima"" and the more traditional ""The First Noel."" In addition, Hrynkiv plays solo on several shorter pieces (""Winterlude No. 2, 3 and 4""). With only a scattering of recognizable Christmas songs, you can enjoy this album year 'round. [Running Time - 51:25] HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,"com""YULE""ation Cleric: Zeal for Zema`s Zenith","What a challenge ? Conceptualize the beauty and spirit of cold winter nights. Well to my ear, these instrumental interpretations distill that chill in the air and render a meaning from the twinkling stars.Eight songs are original, five imaginary revisions of seasonal standards, and two inclusions of popular pop tunes stripped of vocals yet bellowing like the changing wind. The talented trio of artists creative echoing of a fresh blanket of snow and the darkness of night upon melody, their quite complexity between percussion and other playables,and their use of todays mixing techno all combine to answer. .... Post Script~ Great background seasonal drumel and even better headphone dozing.buyit...save it..."
2,Some good pieces but average CD,"This CD contains six of Richard Strauss's more famous works. Leading of with Also sprach Zarathustra, the CD contains Don Juan, Don Quixote and Salome. Each pieces is fairly long, allowing the listener to hear most of that work, instead of just a short clip. The overall sound quality is good, the orchestration is fine, but the music itself is okay. I am not a Richard Strauss fan as I find some of his music boring, and this CD has not changed my opinion of his music."
4,driving dance release,"Probably one of the best disco divas ever, Rozalla's career now belongs to the past. It's a shame because her debut was better than any other dance cd of a female singer in the early nineties. 'Are You Ready To Fly' is among the stand out tracks on an energetic and driving release."
5,Great CD!,"This CD is excellent. ""Everybody's Free"", ""Faith"", & ""Are you ready to Fly"" are classic dance club favs of mine. The songs on this CD are written with emotion and in my opinion, are powerful. I highly recommend it if you want to sit back and think, or if you want to move your feet. It's a great CD regardless of whatever mood you're in."
2,Matisse Women's Chalet Skimmer Flat,I purchase this shoes in Yellow Snake Skin...I like them alot but I had to return them. I order my size 8.5 but they were too big...
5,Excellent!!!,"This shoes are excellent!! They are nice and they are very comfortable. You can use it with pants, dress or jeans, they look awsome. I love it!!"
2,I wouldn't buy another one.,"This kayak is probably okay as far as inflatables go, and it's very stable, but it doesn't track worth a darn, it has no 'carry'when you pause in your paddling, and you sit so low in it that your paddle or hands tend to abrade against the upper deck. I ended up giving it to my grandkids and buying a rigid kayak."
1,misleading,this is misleading because i thought i was getting the necklass with it so i wasnt happy :( they should not have the actuall necklass in the pic of the product they were trying to sell .
3,Schwinn 430 Ellipical Trainer,"The product arrived on schedule but was unfortunately damaged upon reciept. I don't know if it came from the factory that way or was damaged in shipping. Luckily my husband is a mechanic so we didn't have to send the whole machine back, just get a new part. He had to jump through a few hoops to order a replacement part and it took a while to get. So we had it nearly a month before anyone could use the machine. It's now fixed and operating as expected. If no more mechanical problems arise i'll say it's a good machine for the money."
2,WAS soooo excited to use it :(,Well Of course you hear about this machine starting to squeak terribly after a couple months. I got on mine for the first time and the squeaking started!! My fiance is trying to fix it right now. And this squeaking is SOOOO loud!! I hate it! I bought a NordicTrack at Costco but returned it because it was too big and heavy. Now I find out this thing sounds like something DYING! Maybe I should just return them all and buy the ones on Craigs list for $300.
1,Does Not Work,"Bought this machine on March 6th, have not got to use it yet because it don't work after putting it all together!! Called Schwinn and going to set up an appointment to get it fixed!! Well see when I get to use it!! Very disapointed!"
5,very good trainer,"My wife and I have had the 430 for about three weeks now and we are extremely happy with it. We researched and tried several makes and models and based on the reviews and feel of this elliptical we purchased it from Amazon. It arrived quickly and was easy enough to assemble. This was the cheapest trainer we looked at, but it seems more strudy and balanced than the more expensive Sole and others we researched.pros - price, construction and weight, heavy fly wheel, pulse metercons - no custom programs, 18"" stride"
3,Elliptical 430 trainer LCD not working,"Finally took the time to assemble this monster. A little bit heavy, but still manageable. Given the special promotion from Amazon 599 (including mats) can't resist it.took about 2 hours to assemble as what the others mentioned. getting a hammer ready is a good way to go. come with a part changes notification, but didn't specified which is which. but still i got it figured out.Everything is great, except that when i finally got the last piece assembled. plug in the AC power. darn... the LCD is not working!!press here and there, it just won't light up. would have to see how the customer reps going to handle this. will follow up my review."
2,Would NOT recommend!,"I purchased the Schwinn 430 elliptical the end of February. I wanted to get ""fit"" before my vacation May 9th. Well too bad after 1 month, the machine started making the loudest screeching noise you've ever heard! I called Schwinn (you actually call Nautilus)and we had to try to do a phone diagnosis. The rep then said that I needed a complete new wheel assembly and that a technician would call me to make an appt to come to my home to replace in about one week. Well, it's been 10 days so I called again. Now the rep says, ""No the technician only comes after all the parts are delivered to your house, and your parts are on backorder until the middle of May."" Great!! No one would have contacted me to let me know, and now the machine is basically useless to me. So much for getting ""fit"" before vacation. Very bad customer service with Nautilus, she wasn't even apologetic at all. I would not purchase this item!!"
1,Negative Experience,"We bought the machine Elliptical 430 in Jan 2008. The structure is sturdy and easy to assemble and use. However, after two months of using it, we started encountering problems. In April, we found problems with the machine Main Unit. It did not respond to resistance level and the pedaling were not smooth (not doing a circular motion) anymore.We called the Customer Service in May (and it has already past 90 days). They said it is a simple problem. They wanted us to do the fixing and replace the parts. However, we informed them that we were not able to fix it. We haven't used the machine until now.We should have researched the 'Schwin' owner Blog"
3,Nice machine if it worked from the box**Updated***,I ordered this when Amazon had this in the gold box special for $499 plus free bowflex mat. It was delivered via a shipping company which was great.We opened the box and everything was packed very secure in the box. My husband started putting it together and all the parts were there and he said the directions were very easy to read. We found the right foot pedal was broken. The plastic was in 3 pieces. I called Schwinn and they are sending the new part. After 1.5 hours my husband got it all put together and now the flywheel is rubbing in the housing. It makes this awful rubbing/grinding noise. I will post what happens in the near future.The noise worked itself out in a day. This is a great machine. We love the size. It is in the bedroom. I love the programing features. I have used it everyday since we put it together. We were actually looking at spending over $1000 for a machine but this one is great for half the price.
4,Smooth flywheel and excellent value,"This is a fantastic elliptical for the money. My wife tested one out at Dicks sporting goods in town, and we both loved the feel and stride. It's quality built and we come to find that Nautilus makes this product for Schwinn, and you can tell. They didn't skimp on much for build quality. We also have it in our workout room, and the footprint is much smaller than other brands we looked at. We shopped out Precor, Octane, and Life Fitness prior to getting on this one. Actually, we stumbled upon it as a joke and after both of us trying it, we loved it. Moreso than the Octane we were close to purchasing. I'd highly recommend this unit to anybody who wants a high-end residential unit for a fraction of the cost of a professional unit."
4,so glad I read the reviews!,"I bought the schwinn 430 based on the huge number of positive reviews. This is a great machine. It could use a couple more features, but what do you get for $600 these days. Quality, ease of assembly, and ease of use are all excellent. If I were to upgrade I would look for one with the incline option and also pivoting foot plates. I use a Precor at work and love it, but can't afford it's price tag for home use."
3,Haven't got to use it yet.,"I bought this item in early January 2009. I opted for the free shipping and it arrived almost 2 weeks later--which was expected. I was so excited that I put it together right away. Unfortunately, one part was broken and one part was missing. I called Schwinn the next day and after 3 calls I finally got the parts ordered. They shipped them via USPS so I could expect them soon. It has been a month since I ordered the machine and still haven't used it. I'm hoping for the best. I will update after I have used the machine for a few weeks."
4,Nice product - but a little painful to assemble,"I had some trouble putting it together, as the assembly manual had incorrectly labeled some of the hardware. However, once it was fully assembled, it is very smooth and quiet. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
4,Best Buy,"I love my Schwinn! I've used it consistently since I purchased it. I've used the more ""professional"" ellipticals in the gym, and for the money, this one is very comparable."
5,Very pleased!,"I did my research before purchasing this elliptical and must say that I am extremely pleased with the product. The company delivered it on time and a week earlier than expected. I had no problems putting it together, which I did by myself and it only took about 3 hours. I have been using the elliptical 4-5 days a week and it is a great product. It is a very quiet machine, so I can watch t.v. while exercising, and I don't have to turn the volume up so the neighbors can hear. This product was an excellent purchase and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
4,Good piece of equipment,"I can't give this product 5-stars because I haven't owned it long enough (about three weeks),but so far I am very happy with my purchase. Assembly was fairly easy and not too time-consuming. The elliptical trainer gives a great cardio workout."
2,Problems right away!,"Well, we put the elliptical together, that was not bad. Except, the computer won't turn on unless you disconnect and re-attach the power connection at the wheel each time. Then it turns on. However once it turns on, the resistance is very tight and although on the screen it LOOKS like the resistance decreases or increases, in fact it stays the same, which is way too difficult for me being a beginner. I barely can walk on it.....So something is very obviously wrong with the system and the computer...So i will call customer servie tomorrow and if they are of no assistance i guess i do a total exchange with Amazon...oh how much fun will this be????"
5,great addition to the house,"I really like this elliptical and definitely recommend it. I've had it for almost a year, and have had no problems with it at all. It is great having an elliptical in your living room - especially this one b/c it doesn't make noise, so you can still watch tv. Great price. You have to put it together yourself, and i did need my husband to do a couple of the harder pieces due to strength needed. The one thing I'll say is the delivery box is huge and heavy! Which I expected, but I basically had to unload one piece at a time in my driveway to bring it in. I cancelled my gym membership b/c i never went, so i could justify the price. And I use this A LOT!****Updated review - I moved this in late 2009 to a new house. I think something got knocked because it never really worked right again. A lot of clicking inside and then the display messed up. We gave it away. Just wanted to update this."
2,Back Pain City,"This elliptical was actually easy to put together with no missing parts. The directions were nice, detailed and clear. It started squeaking after a little while, but was fixed by loosening up some of the screws that joined the pedal bars to the main center piece. The only complaint I have is that the pedals are kind of small... I can't get my feet forward enough so I end up leaning forward if I want to grab the handles, and that makes my back hurt. *Edit - this small-pedal-issue is more than just a small complaint. Any time I've ever tried to use it I had sharp lower back pains the next day. I used it yesterday for the first time in about a year (I routinely use ellipticals at the gym) and I am in awful pain today. I feel like the bar underneath the foot pedals is not placed right, like the foot pedals should be moved further forward, and then I'd be fine. Anyhow, I'll be looking to sell this elliptical. Barely used, since my back can't take it."
5,Scgwinn 430 Elliptical trainer review,Ordering the elliptical was uncomplicated! Assembly was uncomplicated!!Delivery arrangements were excellent!!! All in all I would recommend buying the product through Amazon!!!!
5,Keeps on ticking,"I have had my machine since July 07. I have had very little trouble with the machine. My wife and I use the machine 4x a week, so it gets used a lot. I read the reviews on amazon before I bought this product and realized it is not a gym quaility machine. I looked at the price and realized it also didn't have a gym quaility price. I would buy this machine again if I had a reason to."
5,"As good as advertised, maybe better!",Wife had to give up running due to knee problems. She has absolutely fallen in love with the Schwinn 430! We did our research and found it to be the best value for our needs!
1,"very bad product,don't buy. very rude customer service","defect product, contact SCHWINN, four times, they said they will send a guy here, but never comes. Very rude customer service. Not responding to emails."
5,even better than high expectations,"The schwinn 430 (bought from Amazon) was delivered to my door in one week, no charge! The assembly took my wife and I about an hour or so. This 430 is totally silent in operation! The touch screen is easy to use. It has built in wheels in front and rear handle to easily move it around.It is truely wonderful to use, even better than my high expectations. Also, it seems that schwinn has improved the 430 with two sets of twin wheels on its track, no vibration, everything is very very solid in operation! I tried numerous others at the local Dicks store...buy the schwinn 430!!"
4,Great,I love the Schwinn 430 Elliptical Trainer. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because when I put it together the console did not work. I called the company and they are sending another unit and technician to fix it. Overall it seems as sturdy as the machines I use at the gym. Good Buy!
2,Schwinn 430 Elliptical Trainer,"This trainer was fairly easy to assemble though several parts were mislabeled left and right components cross labeled. The internal electric motor was defective. I notified Schwinn and they shipped me the parts required. Since this unit has a parts and labor warranty I called Schwinn to schedule the repair, after a two week wait I called again and was told that the northern California people would be in touch.Long story short I called Amazon and explained the problem and Amazon picked the unit up via truck and gave me a refund no hassle. Thank You Amazon!!"
4,Excellent value elliptical,"For the price, the Schwinn elliptical is an excellent value. Of the many models and types my husband and I tested in local stores, the Schwinn had the smoothest mechanism by far. Even when evaluated against larger models at twice the price.It took my husband much longer than 2-3 hrs. to assemble, but the directions he downloaded, and the tips he found online from other owners, were easy to understand and helpful. It was worth the time, because it runs VERY smoothly and quietly.The only negative is heavy plastic foot pads. When operating, tennis shoes make a smacking noise that is irritation. We solved the problem by using small pieces of carpet on the foot pads--a tip we read from another owner.Everything works well and we are very satisfied."
4,My first eliptical machine...,"I finally figured I better do something to help me keep in shape. Im a 36 year old male and feel that I have let myself go physically for some time and it is time for that to change. I did my research, and found this unit. I purchased it from Amazon and was very pleasantly surprised at how quickly and efficiently the transaction went. I received the machine within two weeks with no surprises. I like to build things so the building of the machine was no problem. One person could build it but it would help to have some help for the times when you need to haul the heavy components around and place them on the structure. The instructions were very clear and everything is marked well. The machine functions effortlessly and I have been happily using it now for 2 weeks. Im very pleased with Schwin and Amazon."
3,Pretty nice while it lasted,"Bought this a bit less than two years ago, and it was nice and reliable (save some noise issues) while it lasted. Last week the noise coming from the flywheel got louder and some plastic piece started to shred inside the wheel (plastic shavings were coming out). Needless to say, this appears to be the end of it. The flywheel is one sealed piece, so I see no way of remedying this. I rely on this machine quite a bit, so I need to find a replacement."
5,Excellent product for the money,"I was a little skeptical buying this elliptical since I didn't have a chance to try it out before buying it. I had looked other models at Sears and Dicks Sporting, but the ones in this price range were basic and flimsy. Going on feedback on Amazon and the web I chose the Schwinn. Had it for a month and this machine is perfect for my family - smooth, intuitive controls and, after a bit of tweaking, very quiet. Do not overtighten the handlebars to the frame - key step. In my case there was no need to spend over $1,000 for a home elliptical - this one is a perfect fit."
2,timely service lacking,"When the elliptical works we love it. Bought it in April. Electrical issues began July 2. It is now Sept. and it still doesn't work properly. Problem has been getting service to show up in a timely manner. Have now waited another week since reporting a problem and still haven't heard from the repair person. If you buy this equipment, an extended warranty is a must. Now if we could only get someone to show up and truly fix it..."
2,What an annoying piece of...,"15 minuets from assembly time it started squeaking in a very high pitch noise. I have already spent 40.00 on lubrication, no help. You need a loud headphone set plugged into your ears in order to get over it. If there is anyone home, you simply cannot use it, or you drive everyone else nut! Schwinn, please stick to bicycle...Also, when you press, results, it says, GREAT JOB. WTF? If you go over the time you have allocated, it still shows the old results. A total fit for you get what you pay for."
4,Shaky start but all good in the end,"This purchase started as a nightmare! I received the elliptical and it was so easy to put together. I did the whole thing alone and it less than two hours with no problems at all until I tried to use it. The main wheel portion made the most horrible squealing noise you have ever heard in your life. I called Nautilus/Schwinn and they were very nice and scheduled to send a technician to my home. A week later, still no call from the technician so I recalled Nautilus/Schwinn who apologized and scheduled a technician again. A few days passed and still no call, I emailed Amazon and my only two options were replacement or refund. I chose a replacement unit, put the thing together again and now everything is perfect. The Elliptical (finally) works great. My biggest disappointment is with Amazon and how they would not offer any type of compensation for the inconvenience."
5,well worth it!,Easy to follow assembly instructions. All the pieces fit well. The computer is intuitive. I love the quickstart. My wife uses the other programs. It is SO quiet I can watch tv while I workout without having to turn the volume way up. We put it behind the sofa so we can watch TV when we work out. My wife and I take turns on it. I will update in 6 months or so.
3,Mid-Level,"My wife and I got a tip that Schwinn made the best mid-priced elliptical. We were happy with the price and reviews were high, so we made the purchase. However, I don't use the machine, just my wife. The reason is that the stride is too short for my liking. I like to alternate the ride on my toes to work my calves, and then my heels to work legs and I can't do that on this machine. You have to stay on the front part of your foot because of the stride."
3,Installation Issues,"Bought the Elliptical after lot of research and with highest rating in its class I was confident to get a good product but that was not the case, I got two machines replaced because of the alignment. Also contacted Schwinn Customer service who sent me the replacement parts but that did not solve the issue with first machine.In the second machine the alignment was so bad the wheel would come out of main assembly during workout. Had to send the second piece also back.Not very happy with the product."
1,The computer died!!!,I used it only sparingly. Less than a year later the computer died. The buttons stopped responding. Replacement costs $150!
5,Elliptical Trainer,"This machine offers the greatest workout I've ever had. 10 Times better than my treadmill. I highly recommend it, if you are serious about getting in better physical health and maintaining once you've reached your goal."
5,Schwinn 430 Elliptical Trainer,"I read many reviews before I decided to buy this product. When I received it, I was not disappointed! Although the box was very heavy, I took the individual components into the house one by one and assembled them by myself. The assembly went flawlessly and only took about 2 hours. Make sure that you familiarize yourself with all components first by consulting the excellent manual. The included tools were a nice touch, and I purchased some lithium grease as advised by other reviews and used it generously on the parts requiring lubrication, even though they were ""pre-lubed"". All parts are high quality and went together easily. Once finished, the machine operated silently. I convinced my wife to try it out and she has used it several times already, although she is not the ""exercise type"". The 25 lb flywheel has been mentioned by others, and is key to the quality and smoothness of this unit. For the price, you can't beat this unit and it is compact to boot!"
4,Shipping policy unclear,"The problem I ran into is that it's not clear anywhere on Amazon's web site that the ""Free Shipping"" is delivered to curbside only."
4,Does the job,"Great product which does the job with everything you need. Quiet and stable, the elliptical has an even and smooth motion. There are many levels to choose from and an array of programs. My only gripe is that it's really hard even on the 3rd or 4th level. I may be out of shape but the machine is quite tight. I would recommend it for someone looking for a solid workout."
4,So far so good!!!!,"Assembly was a breeze, took about 1-1/2hrs. We have had the machine for two weeks now and very happy so far. My wife and I have both used it daily. We are very happy with the motion and setup of this machine. The electronic display is very simple to use and the programs are easy to follow."
4,Buyers who have owned the 430 over a year,I would like to hear from people who have owned and used the 430 for 6 months or longer. How has it held up? what about that squeeky noise?
3,Squeaky Schwinn 430,"During only the fourth use of my new Schwinn 430 elliptical, one of the right pivot mechanisms developed a loud squeal. I have yet to try loosening the screws or oiling the joint. The operation is nice and smooth, and the machine is otherwise quiet."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I bought a Schwinn elliptical (Schwinn Fitness is owned by Nautilus so they are the same products). It was fine for a week but became very noisy. Because of the cheap design it takes constant lubing to keep it quiet. The quality control on construction is horrible. While my wife was using it the mast broke off and she went tumbling. The mast bracket has four big bolts for a solid connection but the bracket was welded to the tube with thin tack welds. The Chinese peasant who did the welding probably had only one days training on how to weld.I contacted Schwinn/Nautilus but unfortunately for me the warranty has expired and they only offered to sell me a new mast even though I sent them a photo of the broken bracket, an obvious latent defect. I declined. The product goes into the dumpster and I will never buy Nautilus again."
2,Only workout you get out of this is when you keep on fixing it.,"We are into 3 years now. My wife uses this daily for 45 min workout. I have fixed it numerous times by taking apart the motor case, or by removing lcd panel and tweaking, resetting etc., I worked out very little in this machine, but got excellent workout fixing it.. Thank you Schwinn for making sure I get work out one or the other way...My recommendation to you is to spend more money and get a quality product. Not this machine. Their customer service sucks.."
4,Assembly,"The same problem Jeremiah II mentioned with not having the M8x25 bolts happened to me. I used the 6 M8x20 Flat Head allen wrench bolts, that have the blue lock-tight ""glue"" on them, in attaching the front stabilizer to the main unit, and the main unit to the ""roller assembly"", with perfect success, ie they weren't used anywhere else. He is also right in saying ""...parts changed their part number on each page they were displayed"", and I will add that the directions don't specify which M8x20 bolts to use in what location, but that I used the 4 black M8x20 Hex bolts to attach the upper arms to the mast, and the legs to the flywheel. Sorry for not being more specific, but I don't have the manual in front of me. Anyway everything else should fall in place ok. I really like the machine so far, and think it's probably the best mid range out there. I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because the assembly directions stink. But again, with the tips and patients even the mechanically disinclined should be ok."
3,Shippping was misrepresented,"I purchased the Schwinn 430 Elliptical Trainer January 13th for $599. When I tried to arrange a delivery date, I was told the elliptical would be placed on my deck, inside the entrance to my garage, or inside the door of my home. They would not move it and it was my responsibility to carry it to whatever spot I wanted and also put it together. When I tried to find out how much the 'white glove' delivery would cost, I was eventually told $499. This is absolutely ridiculous and I will have to hire some yard workers to put it where I want and I will have to figure out how to put it together. This was not ever discussed in any of my dealings with Amazon or ABF the delivery company. I am upset that I have to pay the additional money and not have the expertise to put it together."
4,"Good, but screwed up screws in assembly","I just assembled my elliptical last night and have used it once. It's my first one (other than those I used at the gym) that level 1 resistance seems pretty strong, but it may also be the course I chose to do. It's been a while since I worked out, but I felt like I got a great workout. It took me about 40 minutes to get the parts of out the box, but once I did I found it relatively clear to put together, except for one thing. There are two bolts that are the same size and while the directions say to use a different tool, you are supposed to infer that means use the different screws. Had I known this before I made the mistake the total assembly time (including 40 minutes to remove it from the box) would have been about 2 hour and 15 minutes; however, I used the wrong screws in one step and had tightened them so well that it took me 45 minutes to correct my mistake. All in all, I think it will be a good purchase."
4,Solid Machine,"I just got mine today after doing about 3 months of solid researching. Like other reviews posted thus far, many roads led to this machine.Assembly was pretty straight forward; however, figuring out which bolts to use was a bit unclear. 2 hours is about right for the over all assembly time. Some squeaks when first used, but quickly they went away.Machine is solid. Does not have the shake/rocking motion and it was a good work out when first used.Aside from the small icons on the manual, I am rather quite pleased thus far. I'll check back in a few months to give up date on any problems (if any) that arise or to brag about how good it is.In short, solid buy."
4,Great workout!,"The assembly was fairly simple and (as explained in other reviews that I saw prior to my purchase)it was better to have one person read the instructions and two others work on the actual assembly. It took one hour and ten minutes with the three of us. The computer / console was defective; so,if you can, test it before you get the whole system screwed together. This seems a common complaint though customer service was quick to remedy the situation by replacing the bad parts (both the adapter and the inside wire were defective.) After using for a short time, we have some squeaking noises but I intend to get some type of lubricant to put on the noisy mechanisms. Overall I'm very satisfied with the workout. Two of my kids use it in addition to me and we feel and see the results!"
4,I love my elliptical!,"This is a great elliptical for the money! It's smooth and easy to use and setting it up was pretty easy. There is a squeek that is kind of annoying and I can't find where it's coming from, but overall it's fantastic."
3,Nice machine for the price...but a bit noisey,This machine is a great value for the price. The machine is relatively compact compared to other similar models. Construction seems solid although it is a little noisey at low speeds.
4,Still Satisfied at 1 1/2 years of use,"I bought this product for use in a room my wife and I have turned into a home gym. Given that the room is not huge, this product's small footprint was very nice. We also like the solid feel and whisper quiet operation. Our average weekly use is about 5 hours (more when it's too snowy or icy to run outside). The resistance range is good, as well. The only problems we have had are some initial squeeking (solved nicely with some silicon lubricant sprayed on the moving parts -- please note: silicon, NOT petroleum based -- unless of course, you want the lubricant to eat the machine's rubber parts, as other reviewers have noted) and that one of the four bolts for the left-upper arm attachment wouldn't attach properly (the other three hold it in place just fine)."
4,Compact Schwinn 430 Elliptical Is Perfect For Small Area,"We wanted a low impact piece of exercise equipment to fit in our small office, so the footprint of the Schwinn was the first important criteria. It also had to have smooth action, provide a good workout with varying levels of difficulty, and look solidly built (not cheap""), with a history of reliability. All these attributes were needed at our budget of under $700. We are very happy with our Schwinn 430 and it has met or exceeded our expectations in each of the above criteria. In addition, if you follow the assembly instructions and illustrations it is not difficult to assemble in a few hours (and I'm not that mechanically inclined)!"
4,Fighting the winter blues with exercise,"Purchased this product online. It came very quickly, sooner than the estimated time of delivery. One moderate size box. The Item was packaged very well. Assembly was not very easy and the instructions were not the best either. We had 4 screws that the heads were not the same as all of the others and the included tool would not fit so we had to dig through our tool box in an attmept to finish assembly. Thank goodness we had some metric alan wrenches or we would have needed to buy a tool or wait on the company to send us one. Once item was assembled jumped right on and began to exercise. It is a smooth workout, you do need to check at least once a week and tighten screws but very pleased with product."
5,satisfied customer,"Arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as pictured and described. Plus, it was not difficult at all to put together, and I am a petite 5'5"" female. Just followed the directions step by step. I had help getting it down the stairs to the basement but I got all the pieces out of the box and set the thing up without any assistance. I've used the elliptical twice now and I love it. It is exactly what I wanted. And, it is super easy to move. It's not very heavy and it has wheels."
1,Does not work,"We purchased our EL 430 and loved it at first. We thought it was a great machine and felt we were getting a great workout with it. However, after 14 months of use the machine broke. It was not tracking your speed and calories. I called the 1-800# and was told it was the speed sensor. They mailed a new one with instructions on replacing it. However, the new one does not work either. Upon disassembling the machine, we noticed the magnet that used to be attached to the wheel had fallen off and was stuck to the bottom of the machine. After placing it back in the correct spot...it still did not work. After reading other reviews, we noticed others were having the same problem. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
5,"Excellent value - sturdy, easy to assemble and fun to use!","I researched ellipticals for almost a year before finally deciding on the Schwinn 430. It arrived in a large heavy box and took us almost a month before we tackled putting it together but it turned out to be easy to assemble but it took us 2 hours regardless. All the parts were clearly labeled and the instructions were step by step easy. Its sturdy, glides smoothly and is simple - I didn't want anything with a lot of bells and whistles. This has all you need. The best part - I look forward to using it!"
5,"Love it! Great Price, Great Machine!","This Elliptical is perfect for my husband and me. We are trying to shed those Christmas pounds, and live in a very snowy place, so running outside in winter can be dangerous! It was easy to put together (see reviews if you have a problem with a squeak (fixed instantly)), and awesome! Totally worth the investment!!!!! Smooth ride, perfect length stride, and very comfortable!"
5,Love my elliptical,It arrived within 5 days and was fairly easy to put together. It took us an hour and a half to assemble. It's very smooth and works great. Great value especially great with the free shipping!
3,schwinn ellyptical 430,"I tried the Schwinn 420 at a local retailer - and asked if the 430 would feel the same, the answer was yes however the reality is no - I like the smooth ride of the schwinn and the range of motion however the resistance is just to tough to start off - I cannot even move it beyond level 1 - I am an athlete, skier, former health club manager and an avid elliptical user at the gym and yes in understand home use products are usually not as sophisticated - however I wish this elliptical would have a little more variance in the resistance and not be so tough to use out of the gates. Not sure if it will break in - hope so because I do like most everthing else about it."
4,Good but a little short-sighted,"This book is pretty thorough it what it sets out to do: not convince the reader with evidence that alien abductions are taking place but to convey the significance of such events and to show that it is happening worldwide. I think Mack kind of discounts or ignores the materiality of abductions. In other words, he doesn't seem to think they might be actually occurring in the physical, consensus reality. Instead, he seems or his work in this book conveys that the abductions take place in some kind of spiritual realm and sometimes enter our material world. However, there implant cases (see Dr. Leir's work) and witness accounts of UFO's over houses, etc., which seems to give some merit to aliens being an actual, physical force in our world--not just in our heads, a different dimension (whatever that is), etc. Good read though but I was a little bored with or two of the philosophies of the indigenous people he discusses."
3,The curved mind is just the start,Rather an academic paper which mellows with reading. John proposes some new aspects to the UFO phenomenon with a crossover to the spirit world and an expanded universe over many dimensions with time on a different scale. Where do we go from here in trying to understand what is going on beyond our simple four walls? As a UFOlogist you can't miss
3,'Hoodwinked' by the phenomenon,"Instead of just stringing a bunch of accounts together, John Mack chooses different aspects of the encounters and examines that part of each account, such as the spiritual aspect, and comments on what the experiencers say about it. It's a bit hard to follow that way, but at least it is different and slightly more objective. Of course, from the beginning I have thought he's been 'hoodwinked' by the phenomenon. He is still trying to make it into what he really want's it to be, as most all do who investigate or experience this traumatizing aspect of the UFO encounter."
1,"""Passport"" to nowhere in particular","The latest fashion in UFOlogy places these phenomena squarely in the spiritual realm, and Mack's ""Passport to the Cosmos"" is a transparent attempt to cash in on the fad. If Mack had done a little more work with the physics, theology, and psychology implied by alien abduction experiences, he would have produced a groundbreaking work. As it is, ""Passport"" is just another shabby New Age hack. Probably the most irritating omission is the lack of reference to C. G. Jung, whose treatment of the '50s UFO scare forms the unspoken basis for Mack's work.The experiences Mack's subjects describe _are_ important, and their breakthrough into Western rationality arguably marks a major shift in human consciousness. If Mack has some idea of what the significance of all this is, he has managed to conceal it. In the meantime, we will have to await a more serious study."
1,Shamanism vs. The Flying Saucers,"This follows a disturbing phenomenon in anomalous research of whatever ilk, whenever empiricial answers do not hold adequate allure- break out the indigenous shaman routine to cast ""illumination"" on the discussion. The new agers probably ""understand"" the explainations provided from 3rd world wise men & women of crop circles, abductions, and other intrusions into the lives of certain fantasy prone individuals. But I am left wondering: ""what the hell are they talking about?"" Dr. Mack's first book still had enough healthy scepticism to make for solid reading. This book makes me want to cheer the academic committee's attempt to reel Dr. Mack back into the fold. With this work, John E. has wandered too far into make-believe-land to have much credibility. Jacques Vallee made a more reasonable sojourn into the folklore/UFO connection some years ago with his ""Passport to Magonia"". This ""Passport to the Cosmos"" has been stamped invalid."
5,"Milwaukee 48-80-0693 5-Inch 24-Grit Sanding Disc, 25-Pack","Milwaukee 48-80-0693 5-Inch 24-Grit Sanding Disc, 25-PackA excellent deal on this production grade sand disc. Come in a nice flip top box very easy to keep and store these disc in for many moons, I have even been able to gather up some of my loose disc and they all fit nicely in this box. After looking around at other brands and sizes found these to be a excellent deal and top quality Milwaukee brand made.These hog off ruff metal with ease and fit nicely on my disc sander, This seems to be the perfect grit for most of my grinding needs and wear great. I believe this 25-pack quantity will last a good long while.Buy these with confidence :0)"
2,Chineese Junk!!!,"Will not work on GE brand, Stems too short and very loose.I tried adding both stems and it was still too short."
1,broke quickly,Worked well when I got it. Lasted about 2 weeks in a tire shop. Might be OK for individual.
5,Perfect for accuracy,"Perfect for ensuring that all tires have same inflation. Both of our vehicles have sensor systems that warn of low tire pressure and if the pressures are not maintained within a certain tolerance, the sensor alarms will continue to be indicated. I bought this unit to get accurate readings and it is easy to use."
1,Stay away from bargaincell,"I have ordered products from Bargaincell. The original didn't work and they sent a replacement that failed. They then would do nothing because the ""original order"" was over 6 weeks old. Amazing. I guess that's how they ""get you"" ... on a technicality or worst ... they have a stock of bad products that only last a few WEEKS and when the first fails, they send another dud. I highly recommend not ordering ANYTHING from them."
4,cracked,"Got this in yesterday, I like the smaller profile than the Zen Vision: M's dongle, it allows me to use the car charger with my window mount in my car (which doesn't have a big enough opening to charge with the dongle)....but, today, less tthan 24 hours since I got this in, the end of the car charger that plugs into the player came apart. It easily snapped back together and seems to work fine, but it still seems loose.Still, it all works and it was all cheap, so I would still recommend it."
1,I Guess You Get What You Pay For!!,"The price was so cheap, that I ordered three to have chargers throughout the house. Within a week, two of the three were broken and the third one is barely hobbling along partially broken. Save your money and buy a different brand."
2,USB CABLE DOESNT WORK? ouch...,"i lost my original sync adapter for my Vision M, so i thought the USB cable would be PERFECT for that. and the car charger is a nifty buy too. but when i get it in the mail, the car charger works great but not a single computer i have tried will accept the USB cable and therefore it wont charge my Zen nor let me update my music or videos. HUGE LETDOWN."
2,"High Expectations, Huge letdown","I had high expectations for this item. The reviews I had read made it sound great. I plugged my Zen Vision M into the wall charger the moment it arrived and everything looked like it was going well. I came back from a nap to find my screen flashing in different spots.My Zen Vision will no longer start up. I feared the worst.Only to realize the wall charger simply was not working. When I plug my Zen into my computer with the supplied charger it connects and charges fine. It does not sync it for access but that may be worked out later hopefully.Considering the price and that this has not fried my Zen yet, I would say it is an OK deal. However I really wish my Wall Charger would work."
3,Chargers Work Great But Sync Cable Doesn't Sync With Computer,"I purchased this product after I lost the original sync adapter that came with my Zen. It was a good deal and each individual charger/ sync cable connected to my Zen without the use of an adapter which I liked. The chargers worked great but when I tried to sync the Zen to my computer it gave me a ""defective hardware device"" error and would not connect to my computer. I proceeded to try it on my other computer but it gave the same error. It would charge through the computer but would not sync. I don't know whether it was just my cable or if all the sync cables are defective but I would advise not counting on the usb sync cable working properly."
3,Worth it if only 1 piece works,"This was a decent buy for my Zen Vision M. The wall plug works just fine, but I don't know about the USB cable, I plugged it in my computer and it froze the rest of the USB ports, which had a wireless adapter, printer, mouse, and keyboard attached. RESTARTING THE COMPUTER DID NOT HELP...I actually had to take the cover off my tower and unhook the forward USB ports just so I could get the keyboard and mouse back online. I will NEVER use it again. I haven't used the car adapter much, but it seems to work ok."
3,Zen Charger set,"This set was a good deal. The Wall adapter rattles and is not UL listed which makes me distrust it. Car adapter is solid. USB Sync cable is a godsend.Pros: affordable, USB sync locks in making it so it doesn't disconnect during syncingCon: non UL listed, Wall adapter rattles"
1,Worse Product ever I bought,"If i could give this product a zero, i would. The outlet charger worked for a minutes then I said let me try the usb port. That was a disappointment. Car charger was also a disappointment. Do not waste gour money, time and shipping charges to ship back this product. Go and buy with gomadic, they are a bit more expensive but it works."
1,Does not work my Zen Creative Sleek Photo,"It stated in the ad that it would charge the Zen Creative Sleek Photo but it does not do it. One of them would not even fit into the mp3 player. I am keeping the items because they DO work my I-phone. However, I needed a charger for my mp3 player."
2,Wall Charger & Car Charger stopped working after 4 months of use,"USB cable works fineCar charger gave out after 4 months or so.Wall charger quit working after 6 months.These were used with caution and the failures were due to poor assembly or parts, not excessive usage."
2,2 out of 3,"I haven't tried the car charger yet but I have successfully used the USB. I've tried to use the wall charger but it acts like it doesn't fit. I've tried several times to plug it in to the MP3 player and it just doesn't. Great price, if you don't mind rolling the dice on which ones will work."
5,Bargaincell 3 Piece Combo Charger & Cable For Zen M,"Before purchasing, I have read the reviews about this product. Considering the price, $4.00 vs. $30.00 for the one piece factory wall charger, this was worth the gamble. There were more of working ones that were sold compared to the defected ones. I am happy to say that the set that I have received works like a charm. True, as many reviewers mentioned, that the creative adapter is no longer needed when using this combo set. Reviewer ""Glider Pendalehaven"" stated in his review that when handling with these chargers, one must be delicate. I see his point. When plugging, always handling the plugs with care as the product is made of really cheap thin plastic. Nevertheless, I am giving this product 5 stars because it works and saved me alot of money."
1,Bargaincell Combo pack - not rec'd as advertized-beware,Poor quality control in the shipping department resulted in the receipt of the wrong items. Hope this doesn't happen to you. Price is right only if you get what you ordered. Not in my case.
5,Great Book of Days Long Gone,"I picked this book up at a Library Book sale in Eureka, MO, as a young woman. I loved reading about the historic St. Louis that I had never known and about the Greek-American family living in the then little-developed Webster Groves area. I have lent this book out several times--in fact, someone hasn't returned it to me, and I can't remember who.The simple writing is not award-winning but is perfect for the telling of the true story of an older group of Greek immigrants and their loves and struggles with their children, all young and first-generation Americans torn between their heritage and their new nationality.I definitely recommend it and wish it were back in print."
3,Good style but flawed by inaccurate info,Mr. Musburger tackles a very wide range of information in a comfortable and easy to read style. He peppers his text with interesting tidbits about TV production and technology and covers a lot of ground.There are some unfortunate factual errors in this edition (I have not read earlier editions). Focal Press should improve their editing process and attempt to have more industry experts read books like this before going to press.All in all this is a good overview for someone starting out in video production as long as they continue to seek out other information from various sources. Instructors in the field can furnish errata for their students that will greatly increase the value of this book.Better fact checking would have made this a strong recommendation.
5,Perfect!,Exactly what I ordered. Arrived within three days! The whole process was painless. I'm back in business with my Cuisinar!
4,Great Type I book,"Its a great type I book. Although I didn't play magic after I went to World Championship 97, I still remember how this book trained me up on Type I tourament. This book might be out-of-date (and out-of-print also) as the tourament environment is completely different now."
1,Dreamweaver MX Database,I have waited almost two months and the book still hasnt been shipped. I am still waiting for it to arrive. I hope this book is worth waiting for....
2,"Cheap, Scratched and won't sync","I got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch. After wearing Invicta's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist.When I received it, I noticed the small scratches all over the crystal. Nothing deep, but they really pick up the glare.Atomic signal, I am unable to get it to pick up one. In Memphis, TN, I think I should be in range, and all my atomic clocks sync up fine. I have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house. Still no good.Basically I spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight. Lesson learned."
5,Casio Waveceptor Watch,This is a fantastic deal. It arrived in mint condition and is performing perfectly. We did have to try a couple of different rooms to find where it updated automatically. My husband puts it on the bureau in our bedroom nightly (facing the window) and it updates just great. He is EXTREMELY happy with our purchase.
1,Terrible,"Excellent bandPoor watchExplanation.................Watch battery lasted 3 months and when jeweler installed new one it could not be re set, he refused to try any more, and it could not be set automatically by satellite either. Re setting manually is impossible since watch does not respond as instructions say.The band is really nice with a quick release clasp. Installed it on a Luminox watch with a rubber band. Improved it 100%.Future atomic watch purchases will be in the distant future when they have it sorted out.Until then , battery power."
4,RV tissue,This was an easy way to order and insure we had enough TP for our trip. 4 of 5 stars because the product is less expensive at Wal Marts in their RV section.
1,Be careful with this tumbler,"My son is very into rocks. We had a rock tumbler that was wearing out and leaked, etc so I replaced it with one that looked exactly like this. It was bought from Hobby Lobby sold under BK Scientific. My son was very excited to finish his batch of rocks that we had started with the old tumbler when we had problems with it. This tumbler ran for about 6 hours when it started having difficulty. I worked with it over a few days but could not get it to work. It takes about 3-4 weeks to finish a batch of rocks. I emailed the company as directed in the package twice. It has taken 2 months and 28 days to get a reply that told me to read the trouble shooting directions. I think that the fun potential and learning potential of this toy is great but it wouldn't work and the company didn't care."
1,"Dull, and not rugged enough","We purchased this tumbler as a christmas gift to tumble stones we acquired ""gem mining"" in the NC Mtns.First, advice: to keep the belts from slipping I used a bit of baking soda around the outside of the plastic barrel, which keeps it running smoothly. Without this, it was sticking a lot and the belt would come out of its track. Having figured this out, I was excited to see some final results, but nothing good to say there. While it seemed to go through the first few weeks of course and fine grit with decent results and improvements, we NEVER got to a final product that is shiny and nice. They are dull. Only obsidian type rocks (glass like to begin with) look nice. I tried double washing, extending the final polish, lighter loads, etc. to no avail. 3 full month long polishes and no nice rocks.I would NOT recommend this product at all. I'm looking for an upgrade!"
1,But some rocks and sand in an empty jar. Shake.,"My son is very excited about rocks and loves to collect and read about them. I remembered the rock tumblers of my youth, and looked to find one for him. Whereas my old rock tumblers were made of steel and stamped MADE IN USA, this tumbler is 100% plastic and reads MADE IN CHINA.The device is very flimsy, very noisy, and stops for no apparent reason intermittently. If you read the other review about a load of rocks taking a month to finish, he was probably too generous. We've been working on ours for three weeks, and are only on step three of five.I really can't say enough bad things about this product. Might make a good paperweight. Otherwise, save yourself a lot of hassle and buy something else. This one is just a piece of plastic Chinese junk."
5,Rock Tumbler,This was purchased as a gift but the recipient was quite pleased to both get it and too open it and begin working with it.
1,The barrel will wear out.,"Someone put zero thought into the barrel of this product. You are tumbling rocks that will continue to grind down to a smooth nature. What about the container? It too must withstand the abuse of all those rocks rolling around day after day. We were only able to complete one cycle of rocks. When we went to do a second set about 3 days in we had sprung a massive hole and gray course grit was everywhere. I had a tumbler as a kid and tumbled many many sets of rocks. Never ever did my tumbler fail. This tumbler is made of softer plastic. As for the machine, it works great. The set is crap though due to the barrel which is a major component to the entire set."
1,Don't buy---rocks wear a hole in tumbler after 1 use,Bought this toy for my daughter because she loves rocks. It worked fine through one cycle but broke during the second one when the rocks wore a hole in the tumbler.
1,"Poorly designed, cheaply made piece of GARBAGE!","Rocks wear out the barrel in the middle, producing small holes which then leak the water and powder mix into the machine and all over the counter. If you are lucky, it will work once; the 2nd time, you have a mess halfway through the grinding/polishing process, with no way to finish, a worthless barrel and gears inside the machine that will grind themselves up.This was rec'd as a gift by my disappointed child. Note that it is sold under different brands, like EduScience (a ToysRUs label). Look CLOSELY at the barrel if you want to avoid this model; also, I think it is the only one with a clear plastic cover."
2,Works great once or twice,I did 2 batches of rocks and on the 3rd batch the grit wore holes in the plastic tumbler so it was useless. This is a toy and not for alot of use. I suggest get something made of metal.
2,"Awesome service, short life","I am 8, This product was quite good....until it broke. I got about one and a half batches before it leaked. Ruined a spot on our rug. I followed the instructions on the box did nothing wrong.Broke in 3 weeks,I put the right amount of rocks in the tumbler.But it still leaked, I am very frustrated over it but we did not protect the outside of the barrel at all.Over all I recommend if you protect the barrel from leaks GOOD PRODUCT."
3,Flip the rubber band,"This tumbler has worked fine so far. I kept running into trouble with it not spinning on its axis. I solved the problem by tilting the front of it up so that the black band makes better contact with the gear that turns it. However, after reading a review here, I learned that the band is put on inside out. Take it off and flip it so that the teeth are facing out. It runs much smoother."
4,Rock tumbler,"This product works well, however, it is loud and not well muffled even in the case. The rocks actually looked better before using step 4 polishing powder. But even my (football playing) boys loved making the jewelry!"
2,Not the Ball in the Picture,"The picture of the ball in the ad clearly shows that it is ""FIFA Inspected"". Based on that criteria, I purchased four balls to use as ""match balls"" for my son's club team. I was very disapointed when the balls that arrived did not have the ""FIFA Inspected"" logo. The picture is very misleading.The ""FIFA Inspected Logo"" is the sign of a good quality match ball. The following is from the FIFA website:""There are two levels of criteria for the three designations. Footballs applying for the category 'FIFA INSPECTED' or the technically equivalent 'IMS - International Matchball Standard' must pass the following six rigorous laboratory tests:1. Weight2. Circumference3. Sphericity4. Loss of Air Pressure5. Water Absorption(replaced with,Balance' test for testing of Futsal balls )6. Rebound"""
3,Disfunctional family Indian-style,"Naipaul is a great wordsmith, and I suspect that this novel has some autobiographical elements. It is essentially the story of a struggling , disfunctional Indian family . It is clear that the author knows the suject and the setting very well, but unless this is an area the interests you, it is likely that the book will be a long and not totally satisfying read. Tony Soprano's family is more interesting, and has more depth."
4,"an imaginative novel, but contaminated with too much detail","On the whole, I would consider this novel a pretty enthraling depiction of the Indian diaspora. Naipul offers a refreshing change from the typical ""american dream"" genre of novels that have arisen in the last decade...but to do so over 600 pages..PUHLEASE..people must realize we have other books to read and other finals to study for"
3,All before being said.....,"Basically a third person journal, very well written, with incredible prose, of the life of a ""regular"" man in 40's Trinidad. But the book becomes tedious as we hear the everyday, every month, every year progression of a unlikeable man with a family of few redeeming qualities. He is rarely happy with himself, his wife, his family and the list goes on and on. An individual if you had a conversation with would only complain in a self involved way and would disrespect you when your back was turned. When Mohun does get his house, I had no revelation or cared. I would have given it two stars but the writing made it three."
5,A masterpiece without question.,"It has been too long since I read this book [probably 15 years ago] for me to offer an erudite and detailed analysis. But I do remember vividly that when I read it that the word ""masterpiece"" came repeatedly to my mind. In a league with Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair"" and Paul Scott's ""The Raj Quartet"". Find the time to read it; you won't regret it."
5,book,V S Naipaul at his acerbic and acclaimed best. This book is one that brought him early accolades and rings true even today. A wonderful journey.
3,Accessible but unlikeable,"I picked up this book at the recommendation of a friend, shortly after Naipaul was awarded the Nobel Prize. Though I had hopes, I must say I didn't enjoy the book. The language is very straighforward and accessible, which is both surprising and welcome. However, none of the characters is sympathetic or especially interesting. The eponymous Mr Biswas is a milquetoast and unlikeable protagonist, forever bemoaning his lot in life but seemingly determined to do nothing to improve it. He marries into a selfish and domineering clan full of equally unlikeable characters. Though the writing is crisp, the story itself is meandering and slow, only occasionally punctuated by events of interest, amid Biswas' incessant whining."
4,I improved my vocabulary from reading Biswas,"The book is tedious, boring, hilarious and thoroughly absorbing. I first came across the novel 30 years ago when I was a private English tutor and had to teach it to this secondary school student who was more interested in football and girls.I can't recall a single thing about the book now except the word ""insuranburn"" (i.e. to insure and burn). Biswas was advised that an easy way to make money was to insure his house or shop, burn it and collect the insurance payout.I must check out the public library to get a copy of this book to re-read, and check whether my spelling of that word is correct."
4,Nice watch for the $ spent,It is a nice watch for the Dollar spent on this item. The catch is that it will work with the concept of Wave-ceptor. And it adjusts time according to the place you are in. So...good watch..!!
4,Nice watch,"This watch is pretty much exactly what you would expect from the picture. The case is a bit thick and the backplate is plastic, but that might reduce overall weight and compensate for the size. It certainly doesn't feel like the lead weight my fossil watches seem to be. I have a smaller than average wrist and it was easily sizable down with the proper tools. Atomic time reception is good even as far south as I am and it rarely misses updates. You can force an update if you feel like it and its really easy. What is not easy is the initial setup. I've never had to really read a manual on most electronics, but you will need it with this one. Keep that in a safe place for when the battery dies. At least for now, the price is a deal for the functionality and quality."
2,A good looking watch for the price....,the watch looks good visually and is great for the price...but the auto sync function of this watch isnt too convincing and manually puttin in the time is quite a pain...i recommend only for techie folks and specifically only for people who live in america.NOT for outside America
2,disappointment,"Kind of disappointment.I ordered this watch for my father as a gift. but when i received it a few days ago, I found a dot sticking inside face of it's cover. it's not small, and easily to be seen. you can do nothing about it, expect asking for replacement, or to break the glass cover. I have no idea how long it will take to mail it back, and wait to get another one. Two month...for a dot?"
1,Beware of Hidden Costs!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this watch even if the manual settings do not work. Once it picked up the atomic signal, it was good to go. It is solidly stylish.So why the one star rating? I hate deceitful marketing. What this vendor wants you to think you are getting is a great watch with a nice band. What you are actually getting is an oversized watchband that the vendor is apparently unloading since it can't get rid of any other way with an attached watch. The product description clearly states that the band is a men's standard. It is not. It is designed for giants and it cost me $6.00 or an additional 20% to have the band shortened by two full links although I could have had a third removed. No one ever accused me of being a small guy."
4,Great bargain!,"This watch is very attractive, and keeps perfect time - according to my puter and cell phone. I had no problem getting it started out of the box. However, it does'nt have the feel of a more expensive watch, that is, it's quite light-weight....and that may be a positive for many people. Overall, an exceptional value for $30."
3,"Great time keeper, decent style, low price, low-price feel...","I bought this watch because it looked sharp to me on Amazon's website and caught my eye. I received it and liked the looks, still very sharp. The only disappointment (slight) was how light the watch felt and somewhat ""cheap"". The case is very light, it feels like plastic coated with metal finish. It seemed lighter than it should given the bulky thickness and size of the watch. The band material is metal, but it too had a light-weight feel and sound. Overall no one would know it wears and feels like a digital watch by looking at it. It keeps good time and I like the ""techie"" feature that it synchs with the time signal (so it's always right). I suppose that's why it must be plastic, to receive the signal. If you want a dressy looking watch that keeps great time for low money, this is it. If you're giving it as a gift, buy something that won't feel quite as ""cheap"", still a decent watch though."
1,SO BAD,"I'was so disappionted when I got this watch with the scratch on it.And the real one is not that good as in the picture ---Don't buy this watch, believe me."
3,An Exciting Read,"I enjoyed this book, it is not my favorite Agatha Christie, but it was a pleasant way to pass a winter evening. Colin Lamb happens to come upon a mystery while he is walking down Wilbraham Crescent and a young woman comes out of a nearby house, screaming, as she has just seen a dead body. The house is only occupied by a blind woman, and along with the body are four mysterious clocks. The plot involves both the mystery, and Colin's own work as a spy. Overall, it's a very interesting story, with an improbable ending.There are more red herrings than necessary and a lot of the clues are either irrelevant, or forced to seem relevant. Even the clocks themselves are not the vital plot point which they seem to be. I would definitely read this book again as it was interesting and a fast paced thriller. There is less of Hercule Poirot in this mystery than I would like or expect, but all the same, he solves this murder amazingly even from the comfort of his own armchair."
3,Just ok,"I've read Paranoia and Company Man before this, and they were good to excellent. This book has an interesting premise, but it tries to be too Ludlum-ish, and ends up being boring for the most part. Yes, there is suspense, but it is quite tough to read the book for the little suspense there is. The only part that is enjoyable is the Science Fiction part."
3,Problems for Intermediate Level Player,"This collection of games presents some difficulty. The games are rather sparsely annotated and it's often left to the reader to see the tactical and strategical rationales for the moves - hardly an easy task! Fine gives the most care to annotating the opening game, sensible for a player of his calibre, but of little practical use to the reader unless they specialize in the opening that is discussed.The descriptive notation the book uses is frustrating. It has been not at all uncommon to move a piece to a wrong square and loose the thread of the game, errors that I wouldn't have made with algebraic notation.It isn't that the book is bad for intermediate players, only that the time needed to digest the games is probably better spent with different material."
2,No Zing From Zingaretti,"Zingaretti was out of his element. As Montalbano he is perfecto:explosive, comedic and natural. La Piovra 8-10 was a major disappointment.Everything went down hill: music, actors, plot,director,anamorphic screendistortion and even graphics. The plots were really absurd and thecinematography lame.These episodes should have never been attached to the previous ones.They were unnecessary and bad Hollywood emulations."
5,Octopus (La Piovra) all seasons,"I am so happy to purchase and own this product. Quality is high, record even old is in excellent condition. Shippment -you can also dream you have your order way befor the date stated. Super. Movie continue within the years from the begining of the season to describe political and game playing in this specific area in Italy. You can call Spider, or stay with the name of Octopus - movie in spectacular way present the functioning of Mafia in Italy and extented ""legs"" of the octopus to US, so much poison coming through. Enjoy the excellent copy and the season finalle. Oh btw - excellent seller to trust and do another business."
4,Building your own kayak,"My daughter and I are building kayaks in an Adult Ed class using this book as our bible. Luckily, there is an instructor who has built 2 kayaks before using this book. The book contains all you need to know, albiet that you have to spend time reading the words repeatedly because there aren't enough sketches to show what is intended. There are lots of photos, but they don't convey the same amount of info as a sketch with dimensions. But, if you keep re-reading the book to figure our how to make the jigs, you'll end up with a piece of art, that you can kayak in."
5,building the grerenland kayak,"This is THE book for the one who want to build himself/herself a greenland kayak,as well as the one who would like to anderstand the genius hidden behind the concept of this boat..."
2,Nice cover,"I bought this book and then took a class with Brian Shulz of Cape Falcon Kayaks. Chris Cunningham says in this book that he built 7 kayaks (at least when he wrote this book), Brian has built several hundred, so this isn't quite a fair comparison. That being said, I found much of the information in this book either too terse to be useful or simply outdated."
1,this did not work,"We used this alarm religiously according to the directions for six months, every night, and it did not work. My son is 8 and we were told by our doctor to just wait and he will grow out of it. So now we have gone through six months of sleep deprivation with no benefit except that my son feels like he failed."
5,Worth Every Penny!,"My 6 year old daughter had not had a dry night in over two years. After one week of using the alarm, she had her first dry night. During the second week of using the alarm, she was dry every other night. Since then, she has not had a single accident and has been dry for over two months straight!The ultimate with options was nice because we could select the sound that she liked (there is one that sounds like a telephone that she liked best--some of the others were a little scary to her). My daughter did not like the vibrations, so we just turned that option off after the first night. I had put off purchasing an alarm thinking that she would eventually outgrow the problem, but I don't believe that it would have happened any time soon without the alarm. The process was much quicker than I could have ever imagined and my daughter is so proud of herself now and so much more confident. It was the best $[...] I have spent in a long time!! I highly recommend this product."
3,Malem Bedwetting Alarm,The alarm worked well for the first few days but then my 8 year old daughter just learned to sleep through it even with the changing tones and vibrator. I would help her out of bed but she was groggy and grouchy and never really woke up. I tried it for 2 weeks then gave up in frustration and decided to try again when she has more will power to wake herself up.
1,Bad decision got worse,"I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. My son became sleep-deprived as he would wake up 4 times during the night and it was hard for him to go to school the following day. He was frustrated and as a parent, I was frustrated that you cannot return the item to the manufacturer even if my son didn't use the product we purchased. My son used my nephew's Malem alarm as a trial for two weeks. Speak to your doctor as he might recommend a medication instead with no side effects. It's currently working for my son."
3,Complicated Chord Structure,"This book had a nice selection of songs, but our problem is that the guitar tabs are far from easy. The chords themselves are fine, but the book has you doing way too many changes for a beginner. They'll have you playing a different chord every couple bars, and I'm pretty sure you could play the same songs with fewer chord changes."
3,Children's song book,"I hoped this book would have more nursery rhymes and fewer ""serious"" songs since it was a gift to my son and 1 year old grandaughter. It would be nice to see the content of a book such as this before buying. Perhaps a different book would have been better."
5,Beginners review on this book - EXCELLENT!,I had learned about 4 or 5 chords for the guitar but wanted to learn to play real classical guitar. I bought this book and a guitar without any knowledge of reading music or playing. And about half an hour after starting with this book I could pick out the first song. Within weeks I had learned 6 fantastic classical guitar songs!The book progresses perfectly for a beginner and each song brings a new challenge that is easy to master. The music is SO EASY to read using the tablature notation. It is a must have if you are learning on your own.I recommend this book to anyone who has wanted to learn to play the classical guitar but has been frustrated by hard lessons or overly advanced teachers. Or just scared of the daunting challenge of learning what seems to be a difficult instrument.
4,...,Why does everyone call this a rip-off of pokemon. Theyre very different AND Digimon came out first (not in america gut in japan). Anyways i would highly recommend this and it is far more exciting than pokemon in my opinion.
1,"Interesting, but not as unique as pokemon&#65533;.","I bought this tape for my kids(6&11) and they quickly rejected it. They have always been pokemon fans and I don't think that they'll ever stop liking it. I felt like I wasted my money. When I sat down to watch it, I fell asleep on about the third episode, but then again I'm an adult."
1,Pathetic!,"First off let me just say that digimon is a lame show. Its about 7, 8, or who cares how many, whiney kids that go nowhere for a whole season. Tai looks like a complete doofus, I mean come on! WHO WEARS GOGGLES! And the digimon can get so annoying, augumon digivolves to-who cares. This is some lame anime (I wouldn't even call it that) They need to have a zero on this rating chart."
2,"Big and Powerful, but","I bought this unit new and was pleased with it at first. Large, powerful, and nice looking, but After 5 years of not heavy use I have had to replace the touch pad at 2.5 years and now the unit wants to start on its own so it does have some problems as 5 years old is not old enough to be going bad this much so I would not recommend this unit since it is not dependable. A unit this size should run without problems for at least 15 years."
1,VERY BAD DEAL,"""Books for Haiti"", the seller, sent me a damaged product that cannot work safely because the interior cavity enamel finish of the microwave oven is split by a strong dent to the rear, exposing steel to the microwave function. I requested a full refund, and was only offered $68. This left me $100 out of pocket, and after a month, I am still without a microwave. For some reason, the seller thinks my losing $100 in the transcation is somehow ""fair"". VERY BAD DEAL. I am also unimpressed by Amazon.com's hands-off, deal with the seller yourself approach. Amazon.com just lost a customer."
1,Panasonic NEVER again,"Door BLEW OPEN on my Panasonic microwave while using it to boil water for coffee in a cup I've been using for months! Called Panasonic and right away they had me talk to their lawyer. All he cared about was getting the microwave in their possession (maybe getting rid of evidence?). When I asked about getting it replaced, they said after they had it and checked it out, they would let me know. How do they expect me to be without a microwave oven for 2 weeks? 4 weeks? When I said I couldn't wait that long, since I have to feed my family, the lawyer said that is the legal agreement I consented to by buying the oven. My only solution is to buy a another microwave. I feel like a fool for buying a Panasonic. Never again."
1,Do Yourself a Favor,"Just turn back now. Maybe you're reading this on accident. Press the back button on your browser and be on your way... On the other hand if you must see feeders, as another reviewer already mentioned, DO NOT WATCH FEEDERS 1. EVERYTHING FROM FEEDERS 1 IS IN FEEDERS 2. That being said, these films are the worst of the worst. There are a few funny parts worth fast forwarding to, but that's all. Otherwise you wait and wait for the movie to end. Its a good way to make 1.5 hours feel like 3 hours. I may never watch it again. Maybe when I'm 40, but I'm not looking forward to it."
5,Gorgeous Necklace,This was a very pleasant surprise. I did not know what it would look like in person. It is lovely. I put it on an omega necklace rather than on a chain. It looks so very nice for dressy or casual wear. I also ordered paua shell earrings in the shape of tear drops. They look as though they were purchased as a set. I get lots of compliments on both. The price is very reasonable for the beauty and quality you receive.
1,Disappointing,"The video's description promises a lot that it doesn't deliver in a usable form. Granted, the master is taped doing each of the Kata, but the quality is so extremely poor that unless you already know the kata you are guessing at what technique is being performed, much less which kata is being performed. The video is very grainy throughout and the narrator describes the action as though it is the first time he has ever seen the footage. It is more reminescent of 1930s newsreal footage than a modern documentary.I will personally not buy any other videos produced by this individual or distributed by this company."
4,A Fitting Tribute,"I purchased this box set purely on the Amazon reviews below. They were right on the money with this 3 disc set. Only being familiar with about a dozen Denver tunes, I was quite overwhelmed with the vocal range. His biggest hits are here and maybe more importantly a lot more that should have been. The reviewer who suggested some of the vocals were overshadowed by the band is correct. I found 4 or 5 had been driven through reverberation which was a little annoying. The sound quality was a little 'warmer' on some selections than others which I suppose resulted from being recorded through 2 record companies, RCA/BMG and an independent label. These are only minor flaws and can't take away from a truly magnificient singer/songwriter. He really loved Mother Earth. Some songs are happy - others are sad. If this is the Aussie budget product, I say let's have more of them."
5,love this album . . .,"I'm old enough to remember John Denver when he was a new young singer, and I've always liked his music. In the last few years I've been replacing the albums I had originally on vinyl, plus adding some new ones, particularly collections. I love this album. I believe it demonstrates very well his versatility as a songwriter and musician. His music for me has always had a variety of sound and mood, and this collection illustrates that nicely, as well as including songs from many different points in his career.The sound quality of the tracks seems to be a bit uneven, but I'm not a musician and although I notice it, it doesn't bother me. Overall I think it's a great collection that really gives you a feel of what John Denver was about. Makes me miss him all the more."
2,Disappointment,Although the voice is John Denver's the songs are NOT the performances we are accustomed to hear on the radio. Some songs sound like they were sung in an enclosed space. The volume varies considerably from song to song.On the plus side the collection includes a number of songs that casual listeners may not be familiar with.
5,Perfect Title,"""Legendary"" is perfect for this collection of John's music. His music was his soul, and this collection is example of what made him a legend. He was taken from us too soon, and we should all yearn for what could have been. The song, the passion, his style, and his message will probably never be realized from any artist again. Any JD lover should have this in their collection.Granny DiGeorgetown, TX"
2,Buy up to date edition of this book,"I saw a 2007 version of Mosby's Drug Consult and liked it, so I purchased this 2005 version because it was only a few cents and in white, which I thought was nice. It turns out that the 2005 version is not white, but yellow, and the lay-out is not quite the same either. Buy an up-to-date version of this book."
3,"Good Topic, Mediocre Effort","I bought this looking for some insight into the increasingly popular privacy movement. I got what I was looking for, but it wasn't a GREAT book, just a good book."
3,An interesting but unfocused read.,"The best thing about this book is that the author points out Vice President Al Gore called for an ""electronic bill of rights"" in 1997, showing yet again that Gore is in touch with the technological age--its benefits and its hazards. Gore believes we citizens ""should have the right to choose whether your personal information is disclosed."" I doubt some others in the political arena care much about this important subject, and if they do, I suspect they would prefer to have the rights of ""the little guy"" limited when trying to protect his privacy from the mega-corps."
2,what mr. rosen doesn't cover,Found Rosen's appearance on CSpan to discuss this book a bit of a put off in regard to reading it. He's hot to trot on Lewinski's computer but made no mention of The Defense Dept.'s release of Tripp's FBI files to Jane Mayer of the New Yorker magazine by Mr. Bacon who holds a big position under Sec. Cohen or the congressman from Washington State who released surrepitiously obtained recordings by party hacks to the Wash. Post. If you can't trust the pentagon or the congress to abide by rules of privacy why complain if Macy's tells Gimbels. I doubt that Rosen mentions these severe infractions of privacy laws in his book. If such are omitted what do we have revealed that exceeds the violations above mentioned.
3,Unfortunate author,"Unfortunately, the author has a very limited and single-minded approach. He seems unable to fully investigate or accept issues in a way that would most inform and assist readers. He seems to have a fixed agenda, and is limited in his ability to think and adapt. I saw him interviewed, and he wasn't able to break away from the script long enough to answer one single question.This type of thinking is risky and limited, especially considering the importance of the issue being discussed.If you read this book, make sure you also explore other books and articles on the subject. These will be needed both to fully protect yourself, and to be fully informed on the issue."
5,Wonderful,"Wish I would have known about this years ago. Highly recommend for anyone who has had a removal of their gall bladder. Helps with every bit of digestion. Didn't realize that all these issues were related to that but, definitely do know. You NEED this if you are having indegestion, constipation or just a general feel of being backed up."
1,Buyer Beware,Please be aware when purchasing this product that the image and description above do not show mg amount. I received two bottles of 500mg Ox Bile. Much too strong for me.
5,Wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is absolutely fabulous and for so many illnesses, it gives a functional explanation of the reason Rhodiola is helpful."
2,Confusing Verbiage,"If you read medical texts for fun, you will enjoy this book. It came in a timely fashion, but I have really had to struggle thru it, due to the verbose and dry nature of this book. I am sure I will eventually struggle through it, but even a proficient reader of over 55 years reading experience, my biggest challenge next to this book was Homer's Iliad!!!"
3,2.6,"this is barely better than a halfway decent album. this does not compare to the first one. first of all there is no Bo Loc or Lunasicc which is a big flaw. second there is only twelve songs, and lastly the beats are not quite as well produced however still good. most of the raps however are pretty good and some of the best songs are 1,2,4 and some others but this just seems like awol was kind of on its last legs on this album."
3,Just okay...,"This is a disappointing soda from a quality company( I consider their black cherry to be the best soft drink I've ever had). The flavor has an unpleasant chemical taste to it somewhat like a Sunkist or the dreaded, undrinkable, Big K. It's not as bad as those but I definitely prefer an Orange Crush, even in a can, to this. Three stars is being generous."
4,Very helpful to have around.,I got this to record measurements of my road bike. Almost everything is metric when measuring a bike so this has been very useful. It is very sturdy and well made.
4,Good metric tape,"Its of a very good quality. I am disappointed that it does not have English measurement. A very good tape for folks needing Metric(milli meter, centi meter, meter etc) measurements. Thanks."
2,Detailed,This book is for the advanced quilter. It is very complicated and detailed. I don't think I will make one of the girls. I would love too but they just look to difficult for me.
5,Bonnet Girls,"After making a Sun Bonnet Sue for my daughter, I fell in love with this design. If you like to applique, this book is for you. I can think of so many color combinations to make each period lady different. Beautiful as a wall hanging."
1,Photo is completely misleading.,This product does NOT come with the terminal nut. The photo should be accurate or at least indicate that in the description.
3,"Extremely minimal electronics, but tap your feet if you must","I bought this Donnacha Costello disc after being thoroughly impressed with his/her contribution to the Auch remix disc on the Force Inc. label. This disc is much more minimal in nature.... whereas the Auch remix evolved into a minimal techhouse number, these tracks never quite go much of anywhere. This is not to say that the album is not very good, because there is something mildly appealing about its lack of ambition. Anyone familiar with albums by snd might understand the sentiment; just because it's nothing fantastic doesn't make it unworthy of purchase. However, if you are planning on hearing something worthy of a dancefloor, you'd best look elsewhere, as most of these tracks lack the pulse you are looking for."
3,"Good, for the most part!!","This had worked perfectly for a few months. Then it started to act up. Whenever we'd close the door it wouldn't completely latch. This would cause the microwave to not start. The light would turn on and 2 seconds later, it would shut off. I complained prior to warranty end; I tried the recommended fixes from Panasonic. However, this did not work and my warranty expired. Panasonic was nice enough to extend my warranty for 30 days to fix the issue; however, they failed to notify me of that and I lost almost a week!!! I called and was told, they were supposed to call me back according to an employee named Honey."
5,Full Size Panasonic MicroWave,"This oven fits nicely on the counter, with space in front of the door. Being a larger size, it is helpful for reheating larger dishes from the freezer. We are very happy with it. The inside is easy to clean which is a large plus to me."
2,The smell is greater than the benefit,We had great previous success with a Panasonic microwave which caused us to purchase this one with the expectation of little or no learning curve. Unfortunately on our initial couple of uses it blew up a potato and burnt popcorn to a point that we cannot remove the burnt popcorn smell from our new microwave oven and kitchen.This microwave should be easy to use but has a personality of its own.
2,"Ditto: Not reliable, broke down twice, 2nd time just off warranty","I agree with the previous review. Bought this for my folks who love some of the features but it must be rather cheaply built. Broke down first time within 6 months of use.Now, it has broken again. It would cost more to fix than to buy a new one, and you only get a month or two warranty on such repairs.I'd rather spend a couple hundred dollars more on something that would last. Not repeating the same mistake twice.I'm beginning to think that things like this should come with a mandatory 3 to 5 year warranty (at least) to force manufacturers to build less disposable products -- or at least that it should come with some sort of plan for recycling for when it inevitably breaks."
4,Panasonic NN-H965BF,"The good: really large; this will take a large pizza and easily turn; it will even take a full size casserole dish (13X9). Very light weight because of the Inverter technology so it is easy to move. The inverter, as I understand it, operates the oven at the level you request verses non-inverters which run 100% power in spirts to produce the same amount of cooking over time. Easy to use programing.The bad; the inverter doesn't seem to have much of a life span and when it goes it costs too much to replace; you pretty much have to buy a new oven. And it does interfere with wireless phones. We can't have them on simultaneously.Gave this a 4 overall because when our inverter burned up (literally) we bought another one because of the size, lightness and speed."
1,Works great but not for long.,"Update: - The third one died in 4 months. Don't buy this POS. No, I won't buy another.------------------Functionally this is the best microwave I've ever owned. Thaws burger in 6 minutes. Cooks taters perfect.So, how come 2 stars?THE DAMN THINGS DIE IN LESS THAN 3 YEARS!I just ordered my third one. (Thank you Amazon PRIME!).I wish they didn't work so well, so I could buy something else.cpu---------------------Update: - The third one died in 4 months. Don't buy this POS."
1,Dead after 1 year,"I loved this microwave when I got it last year and have recommended it to friends. My bad. A year almost to the purchase date it has died. We are not heavy microwave users, just popcorn, defrosting and the occasionally reheated pizza. But apparently this was too much for it. Really not happy."
1,Back for repair within 3 weeks,"Panasonic NN-H965BF Luxury Full-Size 2.2-Cubic-Foot 1,250-Watt Microwave Oven, BlackThe microwave worked great for three weeks and then it stopped. It would not heat properly and I was getting error messages. The return to Amazon was easy. I am not sure if I will buy another Panasonic microwave at the time."
3,Failed after 2 years,"It worked great for 2 years and then stopped working. I'm tempted to buy the same model again though because it heated food fast. A full size bag of microwave popcorn only needed 1 min 45 secs. You can't beat the price for such a big microwave, if you don't mind replacing it every 2 years."
2,Dead after 2 years,"Liked it for the most part until it died after 2 years, almost to the day. Pros: inverter defrost. Put in weight of item and it defrosted fairly well without cooking. Cons: popcorn setting is MISERABLE. Never popped correctly even when not using the popcorn setting. Would either undercook (tons of old maids) or scorch. The door stopped closing nicely after about a year. I thought the door latching mechanism would fail before the actual unit did. I was wrong. Now when I push the button - the light goes on, but turntable doesn't move, fan doesn't come on/make noise, then it shuts itself off. Paid $200 for this unit 2 years ago: at $100/year, not worth it. My last microwave was a Sharp and it lasted 10 years. I think I'm going back to that brand."
1,Lously!! Door breaks and Panosonic will not honer that they have a constant porblem!,"I've owned this microwave since April of 2012 and was concerned about buying it since, I had the same problem with the last model. After you have a Panasonic microwave for a little while, the door gets harder and harder to shut! On the net, there are many complaints about this problem. I called Panasonic and they said since it's less that one year old, they would fix it. But wait! I am handicap and they want me to take it to them!! Since they have this continuous issue, I would think they would have taken it seriously and stopped putting out inferior products. In fact I think their real thought is, screw the customer and let's just make the money. I'm very done with Panasonic. I hope this helps you to make the good decision to not buy their products. Good luck with your purchases."
4,Very good for the price,"Original item arrived improperly assembled by manufacturer. Return and replacement went easily per Amazon procedure. Replacement is glossy and shows smuges/fingerprints easily. The oven performs as advertised. Pushing a button to open the door is different, had to get used to. That can move the oven if too vigorous. Large size good for our purpose. We have an opening in cabinetry which this fills nicely."
4,Good Unit,"This Unit was purchased for capacity and Brand Name. Unit replaced a same brand unit and so far is duplicating the performance for the older unit it replace (22 years old)simplcity yet very easy to usem aybe because it's layout is basically the same as the older one. Kuddo's for that, don't just change things for change purpose got a problem change not extra added gadgetry just to raise the cost, (price), No extras just does what it's supposed to and does it right."
4,Replacement microwave,"I thoroughly researched my options in looking for the best counter top microwave at a great price. This was had a great review overall and was available for an excellent pre-holiday deal that I couldn't resist. It does more than I could ever dream of and I am enjoying it thoroughly. The only exception is the total size. For my rather small kitchen, it is large & does take up counter space that is much needed. Aso I prefer microwaves without a turntable like my last one that lasted 15 years (no kidding). But this is the way they make them now so it's fine. I am still learning all the functions but I am very pleased overall with this product."
5,Great Product,"Although the microwave was perfect for our office, we had to return it for the size of space that was available."
3,The microwave works fine. The button surface doesn't.,"The microwave works fine. It is more powerful than our previous microwave. And I love the rotating plate! However, I was disappointed when the surface on the buttons started to peel off. It makes it hard to see the labels on the buttons."
4,new microwave,"This is a replacement oven for my old Panasonic. The new oven is as close to my old one as I could get. I like the large capacity. The cooking options are very handy. The quality of my new oven cabinet seems to be not as ""heavy or strong"" but it works great. If you need a big oven, fits a glass cake pan 9 X 13, and fast, this one will do it."
4,panasonic nn-h965bf,works very well only when it's been constantly used for several hours does it seem to take a little longer to work. i would buy another
5,Great product.,This oven works great and offers a lot of options. It is better than what I expected. It was shipped rapidly. I am very happy with this purchase.
2,CAUTION! Poor quality plastic door opening mechanism that breaks,"Door button is so hard to push that the right side of the oven moves backward when pushed, requiring one to straighten the oven again! Plastic door-opening-lever piece, behind the door button, broke at 2 years. The latch of the door is so hard to push up that it caused this small piece to break and we are having to replace it ourselves. (Cost of just the little piece of plastic is $10.00!!) If we took it into a service center, the cost would be $50.00. Every time you push the door button, you need to hold onto the oven or it slides backward due to the difficulty of the latch opening the door. Poor quality microwave door-opening device! Also, vividly shows every fingerprint on number panel and door, requiring frequent cleaning."
2,So Disappointed!!!!,"I bought this microwave right after the Emerson I had in college quit, hoping that this one would last at least ten years. It fit perfectly into the space in my kitchen. It is a great size, big enough for a rotating cassarole dish, and cooks like a commercial brand oven. One month after delivery it quit! I am so angry! When I turn it on I get a digital error [HR???] that can only be repaired by the Panasonic Service Center 30 miles from my home. That's right, I have to load this heavy thing into my car, drive 30 miles to drop it off to have it repaired, and drive 30 miles back to pick it up. I just realized the 1-year warranty will expire in 2-weeks so I have to find someone strong enough to lift it into my car. I am soooo disappointed!"
2,not a good buy,"Rated at 1250 watts but actually draws 2000 watts. If anything else is plugged in it blows the circuit breaker. Needs it's own line. The glass rotating tray was cracked but the cracks did not go all the way through,so I did'nt send it back. I do not expect it to last very long. When it breaks I will have to drive it about 50 miles one way to get warranty work. Then another trip to go get it. The large interior , now that I got it makes no sense because I only use it for reheating. A smaller one costs half as much and takes up alot less space."
3,First one was defective,"Needed a large microwave to fill a built in cabinet. Received this one and it seemed to fit the bill. However, after only operating it a few times I noticed a break in the inner liner at the top/back area. It appeared the inner finish was pealing off. This could have possibly been a hazardous situation. The unit was quickly replaced by Amazon with expedited shipping. Had a new one almost the next day. The unit has been working fine."
3,Exterior measurement details are incorrectly stated in specs,"I purchased this unit to replace a 20-year old Whirlpool model that just failed in a rental home. (Twenty years is certainly a good long life for a microwave!) I chose this Panasonic because I have had the 2.2 cuft stainless steel model for three years which is just fine. I carefully measured the old unit, the opening of the cabinet cavity, and the existing trim opening. The old microwave is 24"" wide by 14"" high. All the specs online and in the new owner's manual state these measurements. However, the actual unit measures 24"" wide by 13"" high. This is extremely frustrating since I double-checked everything before ordering and now have a new microwave that does not properly fit the opening. I thought I needed to write this review even before I've had a chance to put it through its paces so other customers are aware of the size issue. Also, I see that the price has gone down since I purchased on October 22 from $157.09 to $149.00."
4,microwave oven,I replaced a Panasonic oven with this one. The other was the same model with 1400 watts. It was good for about 8 years and I paid $99 for it. The oven still worked but the operating switch in the door hinge stopped working. I thought 12 bucks a year was a pretty good deal. Hopefully this one will do as well.
5,I love it.,"This is a great microwave. It is faster than most, very easy to keep clean, and easy to operate. Best of all for me, the interior is much larger than most microwaves, making it easier to deal with large quantities."
5,This Microwave is powerful!,Popcorn one touch button is just to strong for a bag of popcorn! I was hoping the extra power would get those last unpopped kernels and it did. burnt popcorn is what you get! there is a less/more button which either adds time or subtracts time. I tried it with the second or most time subtracted and got a lot of unpopped kernels. one less and the corn is slightly scorched. I'm still playing with it and cook most thing at 60% power or 1/2 the time at full power. The unit is very quite and all in all I'm happy with it. Just a little learning curve to go through.
2,"Already dying, never was great","I bought this Panasonic Oven to get the Inverter feature -- lowers actual power when you choose lower power.But his oven is already dying after only a few months. The door is getting harder and harder to open, every day.Soon it will not open at all.Inconvenient: The Quick Minute function is NOT one touch. Requires two touches to give one minute.Also, the display must be read from straight on. I need to bend way over to read the display.When set on lower power the display does not show low power, does not tell what power level is set.Only good feature is the power inverter, which does allow easier and smoother melting of chocolate.Burns microwave popcorn when I just push the popcorn button.I hate this Panasonic oven, and will not buy Panasonic again."
3,cautions,"This oven is very difficult to open for anyone with arthritis of the hands. It has a push button rather than a handle. The control panel is not back-lit with the exception of the display window, therefore, a room light must be turned on in order to operate it. Previously, we commented on the danger of the heavy, unwieldy glass plate which is easily broken. I would highly recommend that children and senior citizens be cautioned that this glass plate fractures into sharp shards very easily. So beware! A new glass plate costs about $30 and is not included in the warranty on this oven."
2,short life,I have one of these and they have a very short life. After about 15 months the touch panel goes out. I would not recommend this unit
4,great microwave...so far,Bought this microwave about a month ago to replace a 19 yr old Kenmore of about the same size. This one heats much quicker(probably due to higher wattage)and has nice features like turbo defrost that does a good job of defrosting meats without under/overcooking them as some microwaves have in the past. Price was reasonable. Only time will tell how durable it is. Doesn't seem as robust as the old Kenmore (door and outer casing aren't as heavy) but we'll see.
3,I felt I needed to put a review in context to be fair,"My mother in-law just sent me a link saying she ordered this microwave for me. When I saw the review, I wondered why, so I decided to do what I am sure she did, and put the review in context for myself. I do not think that the woman who gave this microwave one star even has this microwave. I think she had a problem with Panasonic, but unless Amazon puts a review given for one product as a review for every similiar product by the same manufacturer, this woman did it herself. I realize that she may be warning us against using a Panasonic product, but I thought to be fair, I should inform anyone reading the reviews of this fact.I hope the former reviewer worked out her problems with Panasonic, and it is not right what she described. I just want to read a review about the product I am buying.As soon as I receive and use this microwave I will write a review of it, but I thought it only fair to put this review in context."
1,2 died in 1.5 years.,"1 star because I couldn't give 0 stars.2 died in 1.5 years time.No screen across the ventilation holes means no protection against invasive bugs (roaches) who then have a perfect shelter.Buying something else.I wouldn't want this ""warranty repaired"" because that would leave me with a ""third unit"" of something that has failed twice in less than 2 years. It's just made-to-fail junk."
5,Great replacement microwave,We replaced a built in microwave with this Panasonic and are verypleased with its looks and quality. I had looked locally for areplacement and couldn't find the right color and look that we neededand found this one at Amazon. Thanks.
5,Awesome microwave,"This microwave is simply great! It is large enough for my largest pyrex dishes, and is fairly quiet for its size. The functions work well."
4,Satisfied with purchase,"We bought this oven after our more expensive one died after the over l2 power outages and surges our electrical system went through during the recent hurricane. We did not want to spend a lot of money since we plan to redo our kitchen in the next few years, but we needed this oven to fit the built in space we already have. Happy with our purchase. It fit and is working quite nicely for us. Worth the price."
5,Fully Satisfied,Bought as a replacement to a similar Panasonic NN-H965BFAPH microwave that failed after 5 1/2 years.We were fully satisfied with the old microwave.The new unit arrived promptly and it performed as advertised.
4,Really nice and BIG microwave,"We got this about 4-5 months ago and it is very good. Heats evenly and quickly and it is HUGE! You can actually put a 9x13 glass pan in it and it will rotate without even bumping the walls.Fits the hole above the oven well, and other than the door latch being too loud (and nothing you can do about it), we have no complaints."
5,Great kitchen helper,"I love this microwave. Is is very user friendly in spite of its many features. The inverter turbo defrost is great, no more cooked edges. I love the sensor cook & reheat features, no more guessing at times. It is large enough to cook a whole meal at one time. The keep warm feature is nice also. It looks great and the design is easy to wipe clean. I would definitely recommend this microwave."
4,Good value for the money,"We had owned a different Panasonic unit with similar dimensions but a few more bells & whistles, for 9-10 years. Itsdays finally were coming to an end. This new unit, though not as intuitive or full-featured, is certainly an excellent value for the money, especially with free delivery (and yet it somehow arrived the next morning)."
4,A lot of power,This microwave has a lot of power. We cook noodle side dishes in our old microwave that used to cook in 12 minutes at 100% power and come out fine. In this Panasonic H9658B the same dish cooks in 9:30 at 80% power.We actually cook most foods now at 80%. I kind of wish I could set this as the default so the quick buttons work better.Overall I am pleased.
1,Check with repair people before you buy inverter technology!!!!,"Inverter technology goes out, and you will have to buy a new microwave in 13 to 18 months or less. If still under warranty you will be without one while parts are ordered, and oven is repaired. It is not worth it unless you defrost all the time."
1,Good; when it worked!,After a year and a half; the microwave refused to work anymore. The H97 error code came up on the display and would not power up. I'm usually impressed with many Panasonic products. But I'm very disappointed on how cheap these new microwaves are. I had a Sharp before this one; and it only lasted 2 years. I take good care of my appliances and its sad I have to junk it because its not worth fixing for the same price it costs to buy another.
3,Great...While it works ...Magnatron flaw,"The Inverter tech. works great...as advertised! BUT as many others will attest, the magnatron tube will break after a very short life. Ours broke @ only 7 months of very light usage. Pretty poor considering our other 2 microwaves lasted almost 20 yrs. each. Buy it if you have deep pockets, otherwise run away now. This should be a recall item!!! ARRGH."
1,Haven't even owned it 2 years yet.,"Bought this microwave on the advice of Consumer Reports magazine; November 2, 2010. It was sold to me by Amazon.Com not the manufacturer. Haven't even owned it two years and it's broke. It's also out of warranty (1year) as well. Amazon should have real people you can talk to when you have a problem like this. Very disappointed as repair is likely to cost more than brand new unit. What good is that?!"
1,A one poem success story,"""If I had my Life to Live Over"" is the only one worth reading. Sorry I purchased - now gone to the Charity ShopSincerelyM."
1,Duh!,"I bought this book when I started to supervise a small telemarketing staff. I have been trying to dig nuggets of wisdom to share. How's this for a tip ""Don't slur your speach"" ? This book re-states the obvious and doesn't provide any insight."
5,The best exposition of KJB-only belief,"Only the Holy Spirit can convince a person that weakening substantive Biblical doctrines, as Westcott & Hort and their progeny did in those Bible versions that were written and propounded after the late 19th century, is unconscionable. I became convinced years ago and Hills's book is a rousing, believable, scholarly salvo on behalf of the Authorized Text. Read about Westcott and Hort, and not just the many ""puff pieces"" on them. Research them and the ways that the NIV, the NASB, the NKJV, the Message, the NLT, etc. came to be. (But also read this book.) Do about 2,000 verse comparisons on your own, as I have done. If you still hate the King James version, I respect your right to do so. But I will stick with the KJB."
1,"""Harvest"" pointless; ""City"" is a waste","Having now watched episodes 1-32 again, these episodes definitely constitute the worst of all the first 16 Blake's 7 videos. The plot of ""The Harvest of Kairos"" is somewhat intriguing, but the story heads the crew in a direction that I believe ultimately sunk the show. The crew's mission, which had been so clearly defined with Blake at the head, now seems to be that they wander about the universe wondering what they can plunder next. Wow, now those are characters I want to root for or care about. ""City"" is abysmal. The villain is ridiculous, Vila's love story subplot is awful and the writing overall is incredibly disappointing."
4,Seiko watch,"The watch is absolutely stunnng. The only problem I have is I need reading glasses. So its very hard to see the time. But if you have good eyesight, no problem. The multitone face is really pretty"
5,red pasta bowls,These are beautiful red pasta bowls. I use them for other food also. They go in my kitchen great because it is red.
5,Nice looking and heavy,I bought this bowl to serve pasta in for a party. It is so pretty I think I will use it as a large fruit bowl.
2,Cheaply made,I really wanted to like these but they were so poorly made I had to send them back. First of all the color is NOT burgundy. It's way too pink for that. There were bubbles in the finish and smear marks all over the place. I bet a slave made it in 10 seconds or less. I've sent back almost everything I bought from this company. I will never purchase from them again. Buyer beware.
5,Sorrento Pasta Bowl,"This item, plus the Sorrento platter were given as a gift to my daughterinlaw. She has loved both of them. They are new, with that lovely old vintage look."
4,Given as a gift,We got this gift for someone for Christmas and they really liked it. The bowl is a really nice color and the quality is good. It a big size and heavy/sturdy bowl. It will be great for pasta nights.
4,A good second book,"A friend and I travelled in Yucatan last year with this book and the Lonely Planet ""Ruta Maya"" guide. LP was better for the basic information and town maps but the Adventure Guide had waaaaay more detail on little places that turned out to be a real treat. We would never have gone swimming in the Cenote at Motul with LP, or had about the best meal of our whole stay at the palapa restaurant above -- the town isn't even on the map in LP. No one book can do everything for you, but this one combined with another, such as LP or Rough Guides Mexico, will really help you get around. I'm looking forward to their new edition."
5,Terrific,"(From Planeta magazine): Highly-recommended guidebook to this fascinating corner of Mexico, which the authors describe as a land mass resembling ""a big hitch-hiking thumb."" Their interest and hard work has paid off. It's loaded with hotel and transportation info, great maps and interesting art work."
4,weird & wonderful,"I had the pleasure of seeing The Billy Nayer show in uh, 1999? Maybe...strangely enough they opened for the Mermen at a small hall in Palo Alto, CA. I wasn't quite sure what to expect but considering that the Mermen had their new (and lesser) line-up, The Billy Nayer Show stole the show.This CD has most of the songs performed at the show, & it was new, at the time I saw them, so of course I had to have it right away, & it's still proudly in my collection. Standout tracks are ""The Skinned Rabbit"" with some ROCKIN' autoharp (you should see him PLAY it on stage), Mr. Satan Butterwolf, and The Closer She Gets. Truly oddball stuff from an alternate sort of reality, but rather fun, really. Interesting lyrics & music, in general, a very strange & quirky bunch and worth seeking out if you enjoy that kind of stuff. Can't really compare it to anyone offhand....4 out of 5 stars."
2,"""Natual"" is not the word I'd use...","This book has one basic recipe: it describes the difference between soap and detergent, and then tells you to pick your ""base soap"" from one of the real soaps available in your supermarket. Then it tells you how to add ""natural"" items to the remelted ""base soap"" to make it more attractive.The main redeeming feature of the book is it's exellant description of packaging, and suggestions for putting together a superb gift box of soap. This section, which is the largest section in the book, is definitly worth the price. It even has patterns for some pretty fancy decorating techniques, in terms of packaging.In my opinion, however, this is NOT a book about making soap. It's about SELLING soap. And, as a book about selling soap, it's very good."
1,Not for experienced soap makers,"People who really make soap - and contrary to what others have said, it is far from an arduous or time consuming process, should do themselves a favor and pass on this book. Natural soapmaking means using lye and oils, not breaking down someone else's soap and reconstituting it.Waste of money."
3,Not a definitive work on hand milling.,"This book is also available in paperback under the 1999 title ""Natural Soapmaking"". Its strong points are beautiful gift packaging aids and ideas. Otherwise, soaps shown look quite coarse and her recipes are barebones plain. If you're going to buy only one book on hand milling, ""The Complete Soapmaker"" by Norma Coney is much better. Either handmade or commercial soaps can be used. Her clear instructions and problem solving guides yield smooth soaps with a professional appearance. The book has lots of interesting recipes and several attractive packaging ideas as well. Not as elaborate as Marie Browning's, but effective nonetheless."
3,"Not quite soapmaking, more like soap crafting","I like this book, but instead of being a soapmaking book, it should be called a soapcrafting book. To use this book, one needs to already have a base soap to re-mill(rebatch) into the crafted soaps included in this book. The recipes are easy to follow, and once you have perfected the process of re-milling, the end products will make a nice expansion to any soap line of products."
4,"Wonderful illustrations, easy to understand, great overall","This is my 2nd soap book. It has a lot of information that my first book didn't have so I have found this a welcome addition to my beginner's soap library. There are even recipes on how to buy store-bought soap & turn it into your own high-quality handmilled soap. No recipes for ""basic soap"" are included."
2,Please don't confuse handmade soap with hand milled soap.,"The techniques outlined in this book in no way demonstrate the real method for making handmade soaps. If all you want to make is shredded commercial soap with coloring and fragrance oils, then this book is for you."
5,Chick at his best,"I purchased this CD after seeing Chick perform live with this sextet, and I was certainly not disappointed. As much as an album cannot usually capture the experience of a live performance, this CD is truly exceptional. This is a truly unique group, which features non-traditional jazz instruments like bass clarinet, flute and trombone among others. The result is a rich musical tapestry. Chick's piano flourishes certainly enhance the album, but he is not the only virtuouso here - bassist Avishai Cohen is one of the most amazing on the scene right now and you will see why. The best tracks : ""Armando's Tango"" - a truly rhythmic piece that provides a real taste of Argentina and the atmospheric ballad ""Home."" That said, there is not a bad track on this disc."
1,disappointed,"The Shine Max product that I was looking for was actually a ""smoother"" not the spray. (This product has been discontinued by Pureology.) SO... when I saw the picture of the product, I was thrilled. Unfortunately I did not read carefully! The product that was being sold was a spray- but that is not what is pictured!I really feel that it was a misrepresentation of the product."
5,Easy Transaction,"I love shopping Amazon.com. The transactions are easy and secure!This is a great product, but it isn't a spray. It's a liquid that only takesa few drops to do the trick!"
1,Toy?,"this is a magazine that was produced by Titan magazine, it is not a toy!Also, the listing states by Diamond Publishing, false again as this is a special issue produced by Titan Publishing for Diamond Comic Distributors for sale to the retail trade in limited edition."
3,"It's good, but....","The album contains good songs, but the song by Gloria Estefan is very loud compared to the others. All the rest are very low key, and this one song in the middle just blasts out with her voice and lots of percussion. It wakes my daughter up every time. I like the Estefan song, but it just doesn't fit with the others. I wouldn't consider it a lullaby song at all."
5,Beautiful folksy lullabyes,I listen to this CD several times a day with my newborn. Many of the songs bring me to tears as I watch her fall asleep. She loves it as much as I do.
1,Truly Awful,"The moaning, whiney songs on this CD are enough to give even the most cheerful baby the blues. If you enjoy torchy folk songs, this is your CD. If you were looking for modern, but gentle music to ease your baby to sleep at the end of the day - look elsewhere. I love the Kenny Loggins Return to Pooh Corner and More Songs from Pooh Corner, Linda Rondstadt: Dedicated to the One I love and the Martha Stewart Baby: Sleepytime(don't laugh). And my absolute favorite is one that is, unfortunately, out of print now, Lullabies for Little Dreamers: Soft Rock Classics from your favorite artists. Do yourself a favor - look for a used copy of that and skip this depressing, adult themed attempt at the blues."
1,Mostly a collection of easy listening music...,"Though this album has a 2-3 really nice songs (by Emmy Lou Harris or Mary Chapin Carpenter) in my opinion it wasn't the lullaby home-run hit that many other reviewers seemed to think it was. I'm 30 and I found that most of the songs had an out-dated, easy listening feel to them. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy ""vintage"" music. But I think I could've developed a better playlist by just going through my James Brown and Joni Mitchell and Etta James albums to find soothing and peaceful songs. The music did reflect motherly sentiments, but I'm not sure this was my primary objective in purchasing the music. I was hoping for something that would soothe my baby to sleep that wasn't cliche lullaby music. Though these songs were not cliche, they weren't more soothing than any other easy-listening music station could provide."
2,Hated about 1/2 of the songs,"a few songs are good, but I didn't like most of them. Several were of the ""dislike intensely but can't get them out of my head"" category. I would put this CD on when trying to get my baby to sleep, he didn't seem too jazzed about it either. Save your money and buy something else."
4,Must for a puzzle lover,Enjoyed the book a lot. I sometimes found the questions a bit hard to understand but that I guess that is done intentionally.
3,disenchanted,I was really excited to try this 3/8 ratchet! I'm a professional mechanic and thought this would be a great addition to my box. To me the rpm seems slow and the 45lbs of torque is more like 25lbs. Its great for dash work ( no dragging greasy shop air hoses in to customers cars ). Perhaps I'm used to my snap on 1/4 and 3/8 air tools that this tool seems inferior. Maybe with time I will grow to love it.
5,nice to work,This tool really help me is really good but is kind of strong when u tighned bolts of nuts but I liked
4,Nicely stained and crafted.,This product is very well made for small-medium dogs or large cats. The bowls are much larger than I expected. The wood is a low gloss deep maple color. I do not know how well it will hold up to water splashes (hence 4 star rating) so I may end up applying clear contact paper over the top surface. It is plainly attractive and sturdy.
5,Great help with a blind dog,"I purchased this because my old, senile, and blind dog kept stepping in her food and water bowls. Water would spill all across the floor, and she'd track food wherever she walked. My husband and I thought maybe something that took the bowls off the floor and up closer to her shoulder height would help. This food pedestal not only makes it easier for her to find her food and water, but the sturdy wood frame serves as an obstacle to prevent her stepping in or knocking over the contents. No more accidents!"
1,Not much of a plot,"Oh, dear.I must be missing something here, given the superlative reviews others have written. Where's the plot? Where's the character development? Where's the narrative arc? Where's the dramatic tension? I'm not quite done, but I have found this book almost impossible to follow. I can't get a handle on what's real in the story versus what is a dream or a fantasy. The story switches back between the past and the present, and the narrator's childlike voice leaves me confused as to what is actually happening. Not my cup of tea, though I recognize I'm in the minority here."
3,All Hail the Honorable,"Rakim's rhymes are legendary - we all know that. But had he fallen off over the years? On this album, it is apparent that he is still as sharp as ever and that his style even continues to develop.Aside from DJ Premier, who produced the 2 best cuts on the album, in my opinion, and DJ Clark Kent, there really isn't much going on in the way of production. ""When I Be On the Mic"" stands out from all other tracks, for sure. Perfect flow and wordplay to the tempo on that joint made it the obvious choice for the single. ""Waiting For the World to End"", also produced by Primo, is a less-recognized track that is dripping with soul. Although it is repetitive, that track is hypnotizing.A good effort. You can never ask for better rhymes and the beats hold together well enough to keep you interested throughout."
3,THE MASTER IS RIGHT,"WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY ABOUT RAKIM.BACK IN 1986 HE WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME,AND IN THE YEAR 2000,HE STILL IS AHEAD OF HIS TIME.LYRICAL,HE'S OUT OF THIS WORLD.ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS NEW ALBUM,IS- BEATS ARE NOT AS HOT AS THE 18TH LETTER. I BE ON THE MIC,FLOW 4 EVER,HOW I GET DOWN,ARE THE BEST BEATS ON THIS ALBUM.AFTER THAT IT STARTS TO FALL.I LOVE RAKIM.HE AND KRSONE ARE THE GREATEST,BUT I HAVE TO BE FAIR.IF BEATS WAS ON POINT,WITH OUT A DOUDT,5 PLUS STARS. STILL YOU HAVE TO COP THIS ONE"
2,Paid in Full,"I hope Ra got beaucoup dollars for this joint,'cause if he keeps puttin' out weak material like this, he's gonna end up workin' at the post office, talkin' about how he used to be the nicest MC to bless a mic.....Now don't get me wrong...there's plenty of weaker material out there, (see: New School-Puff Daddy, Old School-Audio Two) but Rakim obviously has no concept of musical mastery whatsoever. The beats are bubbly, the baselines are watered down, and the hooks are just plain corny. With a solid production team, and a voice of reason Ra should be turnin' out the nicest album of the year on the regular.All this from a man who regularly argued that Ra was the nicest, back when Big Daddy Kane and KRS were his only comp.One word for this album........Ra-ton."
4,What can you expect from Rakim,"only the best right? That stands true. This CD is speckled with great production, great beats, and of course great lyrics. Only 4 stars because nothing can be better than his earlier work with Eric B. But nonetheless it is a great CD for all you hip-hop heads out there."
5,The Master....The Legend....,"Now whereas I can not agree with a lot of folks on here Eric B tried to take over too much...which to me hindered Rakim...but any person getting into hiphop or rap should listen to Rakim, he is what Hiphop truely is...now a days rap/hiphop is a joke with the exception of Talib Kweli, Nas...etc etc...but whereas this isn't his BEST effort its definatly one of the better albums coming out of rap in the last 15 years..."
5,Perhaps there IS hope for hip-hop as we enter the 21st cent.,"The Ra is definitely BACK....if you are late to the hip hop game and not a true aficionado of the rap genre DO NOT purchase this album. If you are not aware of the contributions of Spoonie G, Kurtis Blow, Jimmy Spicer(Super Rhymes), Sonnie Cheba, Grandmaster Flash, The Funky Four or the Fearless Four and your ONLY frame of reference is Li'l Kim, DMX, Jay-Z or Biggie for that matter DO NOT(I repeat), DO NOT purchase this album. If you pass the above test, then PLEASE purchase this album. Just as in the BeBop period of the 50s with stellar giants such as Miles and Dizzy you have Rakim. The production is tight as well as the lyrical content. DO NOT expect to hear Crystal, platinum or tired designer clothing references. If you are concerned about the current state of hip hop.....you know what to do. PS-especially check for the cut featuring Rahzel."
2,How un-realistic can you get?,"Okay, so this is not one of sweetvalley's most loving, touching, mushing, exciting books. I almost fell asleep. However, if you are bored in the summer, and need a read, try this. Sure it will bore you, but it will give you something to do."
4,Better than Bland,"I get incredibly frustrated when I go to a bulk section in the grocery store and find ""rice crackers mix"" that are all different shapes with exactly the same taste. THIS mix is better. There are a few different textures and flavors (one is coated with granulated sugar, a nice change of pace) along with coated peas and nori wrapped pieces. It doesn't in any way knock my socks off, but it is better than bland."
1,Rice Crakers,"I bought this for my son who was on a Gluten Free diet. I could not read the ingredients. I bought it because of the name ""Rice"". When I received it, it was not made of rice but of gluten. Called the company and they said this is just a name brand of oriental crackers."
3,missing ingredients,"This is a good book,I have used the Cake Bible for years,however if you want to make rye bread from this book good luck.On page 326 the amount for the rye flour is missing,for step #2.I can only hope that the other recipes from this book are complete,that is why they have proof readers read books..."
4,"Confusing in places, but good to have","Beranbaum's explanation of the autolyse process blew my mind and she has improved my bread with her little tips and tricks. BUT... much of this book is belabored and reads like a poorly translated operator's manual.The sourdough starter chapter for instance is a disaster. There's good information, but it's scattered and hard to comprehend. It reads like something Jeff Goldblum dictated on LSD.It's impossible to find a really good bread baking book because the subject is so vast and subjective. This is as good as any I've read and I recommend it, but with serious reservations. The material is there to make this book great. Bad editing is getting in the way."
5,A quite comprehensive,"overview of baking. I particularly like Mrs Beranbaum's chapter on sourdough breads. However, a bit lengthy with too many repititions of general instructions. The book could easily be significantly shorter."
5,Excellent Book,I really enjoy this book. It has everything from everyday recipes to special occasion breads and everthing in between. It has great illustrations and the recipes cover all skill levels.
2,Frustrating,"1. I have exactly followed a number of recipes with consistently poor results. This MAY be because I live in Australia and Australian flour is different to American flour. Still, since this book is distributed in Australia, it should be ensured that recipes work here as well.2. At a minimum you would expect a recipe book to give you exact overviews as to ingredients and time needed. However, in a number of recipes that I tried, what was stated in the 'overview' was grossly out of touch with what was stated in the actual recipe. Thus, by a brief glance at the recipe I'd be told the resting time was 1h, only to find out later (too late) that the recipe also included overnight resting etc."
5,Wonderful Bread recipes in this Book,I gave this book as a gift and was told that there are many SCRUMPTIOUS recipes in this book for artisan breads and they are very tastey. She was extremely happy with the results of two recipes she tried and said she would bring me a sample. YUM!!!
4,A great bread book!,a great bread book for a very experienced or someone who wants to become a really experienced home baker!
1,This woman is out of her mind!,"6 pages, over a week, all just to make a whole wheat bread according to her INSANE directions, and it ended up flat as a pancake and too sour. As someone who has made artisinal quality breads many times, this book is unnecessarily complicated, confusing and badly written. Get Breads From the LaBrea Bakery by Nancy Silverton instead and save your time and many headaches with this overpriced doorstop (Which is also how your breads will end up!)"
2,Hard to follow recipe instructions.,"The instructions for making bagels were really baffling, so much so that I hesitate to try another. I really did try to figure out the recipe, believe me."
5,Bread Bible is the bomb!,Love this book! Just purchased a kitchenaid mixer and have always wanted to make homemade bread. This book gave me the tools to do just that and the recipes come out tasty and well made every time.Love it! Would recommend to anyone interested in using their kitchenaid mixer for ease of kneading.
5,Go to baking baking book,"This book has opened a new world of baking for me. It has great recipes and so much information about the actual baking process that it has emboldened me to try variations of my own. Here other ""bible"" books are on my wish list."
3,Found it great to use and have had excellent results,"I liked the Breadmaker's Apprentice a lot better than this book, not enough colour plates and I thought more complicated, but after following the receipes to a tee, great loaves came out of the oven. The Pugliese bread is excellent, but please sit down and read the tips she gives first, as they really work in a non commercial oven"
2,3 Stars Is Pushing It A Bit,"WOW! I'm not sure how to begin this review. First, the book is quite heavy (literally) and there is just soooo much information, that myself as a home cook/baker just was overwhelmed. I love to bake bread but I really have been doing fine without all the scientific stuff. The ingredient and equipment list would cost a small fortune. The author obviously does not live on a middle income or less yearly budget. Some recipes she says to use Gold Medal flour or bleached, others she says Hecker's ONLY, and others she says White Lily and still others she says unbleached! I don't have that kind of room in my kitchen. And if I had the All-Clad pans and clay pans she uses, I'd have someone else baking for me! I was disappointed, you may not be. I bought this book for a good deal through my book club, but I will not be keeping it."
1,Stickiest dough I've ever encountered,"I have been very disappointed in this book. The doughs are so sticky and runny they are difficult to work with and the proofreading errors are rampant. I know from previous experience that bread is not easy to make but her recipes seem to overcomplicate matters to the extreme. I thought perhaps mixing by hand instead of with a standing mixer was part of the reason I was having so much difficulty with these recipes, but from reading some of these reviews having a mixer won't make matters any easier."
2,No Fun,"While this book gives some helpful information I was overwhelmed by the detail. For me it takes alot of the fun out of making and enjoying homemade bread. As one who has been successfully winging it for 25 years, and experimenting with different recipes, the detail in this book, I believe, makes bread making more akin to rocket science than something to do on a weekend morning so one can have some tasty homemade bread with dinner. Keep it simple, keep it fun."
1,Worst bread book ever,"I have been baking bread for 30 years. Every recipie I try from the Bread Bible fails. Pizza dought, failed, Ciabatta failed, Focaccia failed. Do not waste your moeny, worst bread book ever."
2,Possible error?,"I was disappointed because the baguettes beginning on page 335 failed to rise enough and when baked they were what you might call mini-baguettes. One possible source of my problem is that I used a Canadian high-gluten bread flour instead of the specific brands of unbleached all-purpose flour insisted upon on p.338 of ""The Bread Bible"".ARE THE FLOUR QUANTITIES FOR THE ""DOUGH"" ON PAGE 338 CORRECT?The bread flour I used is described as ""White Bread Flour"" at:http://www.rogersfoods.com/"
5,Thanks Rose!,"I bought two different bread books at the same time and i tried recipes from them both. Each recipe was for the same type of bread...The bread from the bread bible came out sooooo much better! i rcommend the bread bible because it gives even the novice bread maker a chance to do something special. As with all recipes it's important to read it before you start! Stick to the recipes adn once you have done it by the book, then you can try a few different variations! It's fun to see if you make it or break it with bread. You can end up with a master piece or a brick! lol! Enjoy this book! As with all baking have fun!"
4,One of Several that are Necessary...,"The Bread Bible is an excellent book; one of several that you should purchase if you are serious about baking breads in your home. I particularly like Rose's section on equipment that one should buy - just make your purchases prior to beginning the bread baking journey. The other feature that I find invaluable is her dual presentation - measurements in both weight and volume are presented. The formatting of each recipe is excellent and of real value during the baking process. I've tried two recipes from this book; both were good, but not the best that I've found. I'm still of the opinion that if I could only purchase one book, Bernard Clayton's would be the volume of choice."
5,Great book for the home baker,"I've only had this book for a few months and already I've made 14 different breads from it, a record for a single cookbook. The challah was the best I've ever had, let alone made. The rye bread's great. Last week my guests made the butter-dipped dinnner rolls disappear faster than I believed possible. The potato foccaccio dough makes terrific hamburger rolls. Everything I've tried has been a success. She includes all of the breads that are popular now.NO, I don't intend to sell it!"
4,Her sweet tooth comes through,"Many good recipes here, but I wish they were sized for more than one loaf. It's a LOT of effort for a single medium-size loaf.Plenty of good and detailed information, and the recipes work. However, she does seem to have a sweet tooth and her more savory breads aren't as outstanding as the sweeter ones. It's a rare baker who admits to not liking rye bread. Gotta respect that."
1,Not So Much,"I was very dissapointed with this book. I bought two because my girlfriend and I read a story together every night, but this book left us wondering how the story was actually a love story. These stories can hardly be considered of love, two or three of them are kinda nice, but most have depressing endings involving rejected proposals or mostly death. Dont be confused by the word love in the title, since its not what the stories are about."
3,A Pocket Guide that doesn't live up to its name,"This book is for kids, little kids. The volume is too short to support more than a cursory amount of information on the many martial and combative arts that are Olympic events. Not to say it isn't a nice volume to carry around if you happen to attend one of these Olympic events and have no idea what's going on, but then again, why would you go to an event you know nothing about? Sure, it is a good little book to give to the kids while they are watching some Olympic event, but you can find better guides online. Save your money for something else."
2,Won't get what you pay for,"I thought I did research for a new microwave and USED TO trust Panasonic. No more. When I boil water in it, the door squeeks and sticks. The turntable is a nightmare. It's like flying a helicopter to get the glass ""dish"" positioned when I take it out to clean it - or when it jumps off-track on its own. There are two parts that have to fit into one another to get the turntable on the gear. It's too too complicated. There's no light when you open the door to put food in or take it out and there's some sort of screen on the door that makes it difficult to see what's happening to the food while it's nuking. If I could afford to buy another microwave and donate this one, I would. Unfortunately, I'm stuck with it."
5,"Huge, fast, easy to use","This microwave is huge with a turning plate that uses up all the internal space possible, which means I can cook and reheat family-sized dinners in it.The reheat sensor works well on everything. If you're expecting your food to be hot, it's just-out-of-the-oven hot.I'm enjoying the sensor cook button too -- because of the power of this behemoth I burnt rice so badly it burnt through the bottom of the microwave steamer. Due to that experience, it's just safer to cook with the sensor. :)"
3,"OK, but...","Replaced a 30+ year old Sharp Carousel with this product when we remodeled the kitchen. The old Sharp was a behemoth but still worked well and, at this point, I'd happily trade the Panasonic for my old Sharp. The Panasonic is difficult to use on Defrost mode, is cheaply made; the door doesn't open wide enough, and popcorn does not pop well, on either timed setting or Popcorn setting. On the plus side, Sensor Reheat works reasonably well, as does Sensor Cook. I use those settings occasionally, though I mostly use timed settings. I've found that I used the Sharp much more frequently as it popped popcorn very well. My primary uses for a microwave are reheating foods, melting butter (NOT good in the Panasonic), boiling water, steaming vegetables. Since I could do all of those things just as easily on my stove top, I'm beginning to wonder if I need a microwave oven at all."
1,failed within two years,"This oven worked very well for two years, until it failed, showing an H98 code on the screen. It no longer heats. Not sure if I'll ever purchase a microwave with the inverter technology again , since this one didn't last but two years. According to Panasonic, there are no parts available, even if I wanted to have it repaired. Sorry Panasonic, you just lost my business."
5,Great,"Purchased to replace a similar (Panasonic) unit in service for 26 years -- the old unit was still operating, just needed to be replaced. Ordering was quick and easy. Delivery quick.Unit is all I expected -- and after the previous unit my expectations were high. I am entirely satisfied with the experience and the product; will return and will send others."
1,Lousy microwave,"We bought this microwave at Bestbuy after doing some research into what's a dependable model. We paid $165 on June 30. Today is Aug 12, and the microwave broke already! We don't abuse our appliances and are basically gentle users. Today I tried to heat up some frozen bread for 10 sec, and it goes on for 1 sec and turns off by itself. The turntable no longer turns. I tried all the other features, and the same thing happens - it turns on for a sec or 2, and then lights out. What a piece of junk! How can they sell an appliance that lasts less than 6 weeks??????????"
1,Unreliable -- stay away!,"UNRELIABLE -- I have had mine about 4 years. I had to have it repaired a couple of times under warranty, and then two more time that I paid for. Now it has failed yet again. If I were to repair it this time, my repair costs would exceed my purchase price.INTERFERES WITH WIRELESS NETWORK -- when on, it brought my wireless networking essentially to a stop. The microwave it replaced has slightly more power, and has no discernible effect on my wireless network. For now, I am going back to that.BOTTOM LINE -- I'm going back to my older microwave, and if I really do miss having one this big will buy something other than a Panasonic.Too bad about the problems, because I like the large size (for large baking dish, or defrosting a good-sized roast), and (when it works) it cooks well. I just cannot see paying $60 or so per year to have it fixed (not to mention the inconvenience)."
2,latch interlock failed,"After owning the microwave for a scant 4 months, the latch interlock that permits it to close has failed. It won't latch, and therefore won't start. Our warranty is up, and we have a useless piece of junk. It seems underpowered as well, and the different presets seem difficult to use compared to our old microwave that lasted 10 years. Where is the quality?"
3,"Great Microwave, short life....",Purchased in Oct 2005 and it died Dec 2006. Shouldn't have to replace every year.
1,Another fine product from Trash-a-Sonic,"Bought this item a little over a year ago and it recently failed . It simply stopped working one day and gave the error code for ""needs service now ."" I wish I had taken seriously the poor reviews I read before , but I was too tempted by the large capacity and the low price . And this was not the only Panasonic product I have had problems with . Sad to think the company once had a great reputation , but like Sony has seen far better days years ago . Won't ever buy a Panasonic product again - the company should be called Trash-a-sonic now ."
1,Dead Magnetron or Invertor and less than 2 yrs old. Buyer Beware.,"I purchased this microwave in fall 2011 (manufacture March 2011) It runs for a minute then powers down and shows an error code. The error code is H98. I found out this code stands for a bad Magnetron, Inverter, or circuit board. Won't be buying Panasonic again."
1,EXPENSIVE PIECE OF GARBAGE-do not buy!!!!!,"This microwave lasted 8 months and then died. It just stopped working. The ""customer service"" is a joke! They want me to take the unit to a service center that is an hour away from my home. That's four hours worth of driving! The service rep was reading a response to me. How frustrating and insulting! My recommendation: Don't buy this microwave and don't buy any other Panasonic products. Total waste of money."
1,Terrible! Broke in less than a month!,"Ordered this microwave for my parents. 3 weeks after purchase, the thing stops working. The digital screen shows an ""H98 error"" message, even after unplugging and plugging back in. We checked the owners manual, which explained that when this error message shows up there's a problem with the generator and the microwave needs to go back to the manufacturer. My parents threw away the box, so now we have to go through the extra hassle of finding a new box and shipping the whole thing back to amazon. I am so irritated by this poorly manufactured lemon of a microwave. Beware this product!"
5,Great product.,Bigger than I thought. Great product especially for the price. Very efficient. Lots of settings. Light enough for one person to move.
3,Works fine but makes a funny noise with fan when starting and stopping.,"This microwave is large and has lots of features such as sensors that tell you when the food is hot and so on. The only thing that gives me pause is the fan makes a noise when microwave starts and stops. My husband took of the back and looked at it to make sure something wasn't broken, but everything was fine. It works great. Still, the noise is of some concern."
4,Mostly great,"I like this microwave pretty well. The only thing I do not like is that it takes longer to make popcorn than my other microwave ovens...like twice as long! This is when using my microwave popcorn maker, not pre-packaged microwave popcorn that has all the additives. I will probably have to get a separate popcorn maker now."
2,Didn't last,We purchased this item in Sept. of 2010. This microwave didn't last more than 15 months! I would not recommend it.
3,Great but Short-lived,"We purchased the Panasonic NN-H965WF on July 28, 2005. It was wonderful, and one of the most attractive ones we found. We selected it partly because a 9x13 glass baking dish would fit in it with ease. The microwave refused to run more than a few seconds tonight, and emitted a bad smell so it is now unplugged and waiting to be hauled away. We expected it to last far longer than four years, three and a half months! Our old Sharp gave faithful service for over twenty-five years!!!"
2,We have had two similar Panasonic ovens and I would be VERY concerned with durability on this one.,"I have to note that I do not own this particular model. Models change from year to year, and the limitation of Amazon reviews is that they tend to be made by new owners.Based on my experience with two predecessors to this oven, however, I want to leave potential buyers with a caveat:The first lasted barely a year before it died: the oven stopped heating, and the timer was messed up.Because we liked the large size and other features, we purchased the next year's model. This one lasted four years, but this morning it died the same death--would only set for a few seconds, generated no heat during that time.Our previous microwaves (Quasar and Sharp) lasted for over ten years, and based on the similar symptoms on the two Panasonic models, I just wanted to caution buyers that this may not be the best oven available."
5,Awesome size,"Very pleased, the larger area of use is wonderful. Works great! The fast buttons help make things easier and quicker"
4,I am please with the microwave,I purchased the microwave on 2/18/09 after my Kenmore died. I used it for 9 years without a problem. I decided on the Panasonic because of size and power which was also like the one I had. I read reviews on this product and agree about the noise of opening and closing and the pressure you had to use to open it. I have to whole on to the machine when opening it to keep from pushing it back. I have used it one time to pop popcorn and by the time the corn had popped there was a hole burned in the bottom of the sack. I will try a lower power the next time. Other than these things I am well pleased so far.
4,The special relationship between dogs and humans,"Allen and Linda Anderson's ""Angel Dogs"" is a perfect present for all dog lovers. As the authors point out, the original meaning of angel is messenger. The individual true accounts that follow from a variety of writers show that dogs do indeed, have special messages for us, not the least of which is unconditional love and devotion. The authors' introduction touches briefly on the unique relationship between dogs and humans dating back to the Stone Age. It is followed by individual accounts of dogs who played a special role sometimes heroic, sometimes healing, and sometimes just being there in response to the emotional need of a member of their family.It makes you wonder what early humans did to inspire such steadfast devotion from another species."
5,Angel Dogs,"This is the first book in the series I have read, I also purchased the angel cats book but havent read it yet. The stories in the Angel Dogs book are very nice and I found them so comforting at this very difficult time of grieving the loss of a very dear dog. This book gives me hope that there will be good times again and that our dear friend is still very much with us and I pray he will choose to come spend more lifetimes with us. The book also helps confirm some beliefs or thoughts that I have had already and now I have the confirmation that I was indeed visited by previous beloved pets in my dreams as well as during wakefulness. The book helps give the strength to go on and offers so many stories I laughed and cried plenty through reading the book."
5,mint condition,"I ordered this book, Angel Dogs for my sister in California. The description from the seller said ""like new condition"" and was very inexpensive. The postage cost more than the book!My sis was surprised and reported that the book is in mint condition!"
2,Religious,"My Mom read this book first and she said ""Oh my, this book is so overly religious"". She said that I should pass on reading it, it's too overdone."
5,"Great, BUT Where's the ENTIRE Show???","I was at this show, it was great. Got the DVD, it is great. BUT WHY OH WHY ISN'T THE ENTIRE SHOW ON HERE??? WHY LEAVE OFF TRACKS LIKE MR. BROWNSTONE, SUPERHUMAN, YOU GOT NO RIGHT, AND, FROM WHAT I REMEMBER, AN EARDRUM-SHATTERING COVER OF NIRVANA'S NEGATIVE CREEP??? Same with the STP Live in Chicago 2010 performance (downloaded through ticketmaster), why can't we have the ENTIRE show??? WE BUY THE MUSIC AND PAY FOR THE SHOWS, GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!"
1,"By turns ghastly, silly, and without serious intellectual merit","Madame Tu has an undeniably unusual perspective on issues, and her service to the disadvantaged in Hong Kong is a well known matter of local record. That said, most of her observations are either trite, without foundation, or politically and intellectually biased. A previous reviwer wondered why Madame Tu is no longer sought by the HK press - the reason is that her views are predictable, largely irrelevant, and not news worthy. A reader looking for a picture of colonial HK life would do better to read one of the many memoirs on the subject, or better watch Suzie Wong - the pictures at least do some justice. Unless one is merely seeking a source of questionable validation for preconcieved views of HK (the US?) - this is a waste of time and money."
4,Maybe a little slip in iinfinity quality????,"I bought these as a replacement for some older infinity reference gold speakers. The old ones blew me away when they were hooked up to my system. These lacked a little. I am still an Infinity guy, but for about the same $$$ I put Boston Accoustics in my wife's car and they destroy these in crispness and quality. These sound a bit too treble-y"
4,..,Not too bad was expecting a little more bass out off them from what the other reviews said but i have infinity reference 6x9s they work great together
4,Replacement Speakers for kick panel,These speakers fit perfect. The extra 3db for the high's is a plus. Good bass with rubber surround on the woofer. Fast shipping from World Wide Distributors.
4,good speakers,"I bought the 6022i's for my front doors. However, the rear panels only accommodated the 5022i's. They are fine, but the Infinity 6022i's are definitely a couple of grades better. Together they convert my BMW 645 into a concert hall."
1,Expensive Headache,"The two halves (4500 pieces each) comes wrapped separately in one box. Unfortunately there is no way of knowing if the two halves actually are matching. I assembled one half, glued it to my wall. This took me several weeks! Started the second half when about halfway through I realized that the two halves do not interlock!!! Almost got a heartattack! The Seller and Amazon are very helpful but this is definitely a manufacturing defect so they put me in contact with Ravensburger. Now I have to send some code from the box and prove that the problem with the puzzle is a manufacturing defect. Then maybe they will replace it. Well, thanks for nothing Ravensburger! I want the matching half of the puzzle that are already up on my wall! How can I be certain that the replacement puzzle isn't a dud either? What am I supposed to do with the already assembled 4500 pieces that are on my wall? I am very disappointed and frustrated with Ravensburger! What a fiasco!"
1,doesn't work,We find the direction book really confusing and cannot make the alarm stop going off so we have found it useless. Whenever it's connected it is sending an alarm and we can't figure out how to fix it.
5,Quality Product,"I had trouble with other CD's either skipping or not reading at all in my 10 year old car's player, but for whatever reason, these ones did the trick! No problems now."
1,Deep Sleepers Beware,"Not for kids who are deep sleepers. I need a wireless model that makes another, larger unit blast an alarm like a regular clock alarm. My son slept through the alarm until the batteries were dead, every time."
5,It Works!,I wish I had bought this earlier for both of my kids. My daughter is 8 and she has had dry sheets for 5 weeks. Really started working after 2 1/2 weeks. I slept near her for the first 2 weeks. Excellent product.
5,Why did we wait so long?,"Worked just as promised and we no longer have to wash sheets EVERY day. Been about a month so far and he is almost ready to lose the alarm. Highly recommeded for any child who is ready to make the change. Ours was and we never had to get up with him. He manages it all by himself. In only a couple of weeks, he started to wake up and go to the bathroom before the alarm ever sounded. He is almost ready to lose the alarm. What a relief for us all!"
5,Malem Alarm,My daughter is 12 and had trouble with occasional night time bedwetting.The Doctors always said it was an underdeveloped bladder and she would grow out of it.They wanted to put her on hormones every night.No way-only for sleepovers. I was never told this could be a cure. After around 45 days she is completely dry and wakes up on her own if she has to go.She is a sound sleeper so I got the alarm with vibration and she had no problem waking up on her own.Wish I would have know this 9 years ago. RXs have to many side effects. Use this and you won't be sorry!!!!
1,Not for everyone,"I purchased this alarm because of the excellent reviews. I think the item is well designed, for the most part, but it does not wake up my 10 year old bed-wetter. The sound is a sort of electronic chirping, and it blends in with white noise such as fans. It doesn't always wake me up right away from down the hall. The vibration feature seemed promising, but it's not enough. I need to find one that buzzes like an obnoxious alarm clock, I think.Anyway, this product has no guarantee and is not returnable. I hope I can sell it on ebay!"
5,Satisfaction100%,"I wish I didn't wait that long to get this alarm, my son just turned 8 and he had wet the bed almost everyday.. I tried every sungle thing i could image until i read a book about the alarms. Firrst i wasnt sure if it was a good idea, but since we've using this alarm i found out that really works!!! My son has been a deep sleeper but the alarm buzz and vibration is good enough to wake him up fast. I've seen progress after the first week... Now may be he wakes up with a little spot, but he's still on the process..Please don't be afraid is a good investment and won't regret!!!!"
4,More dry nights,"After two nights of alarms, we had a long string of dry nights but now experience wet nights intermittently. Overall 2 am laundry loads are not as frequent. We did not notice the incremental decrease in amount of wetness that others describe; she just started waking up dry. Our daughter can put it on herself and it may serve as an unconscious reminder to stay dry as she clips it on her pjs just under her chin. The alarm is not very loud and is an issue for our deep sleeper; we have had to wake her up during the alarm. I resisted as long as I could making the investment as I hoped she would outgrow this but I feel the alarm has worked and the medical literature supports the use of alarms as the best method to achieve dry nights."
2,It broke.,"The item is a bit big. About the size of a pager. On the back of the unit,there is a large clothes pin. On the second night my son used this, the clipbroke. There is another clip that slips over the collar of his shirt but thenthat puts the thing right on his neck. He doesn't enjoy that so much. I don'tsee another way to put this on his shirt. Even at that, it came off his shirton the third night. At this point, and $100 later, it's almost useless."
2,Doesn't really work,"Too many false alarms. Also didn't ring when it was wet at times. It's possible that it was because of the way my child was wearing it, but isn't it made for children and their tendencies?"
4,"Don't know why it works, but it does","My child was having trouble wetting the bed and we had tried everything. We hooked this alarm up and after two times of it going off, she hasn't had a wet bed since. Coincidence? Possibly, but it was worth the money if this little alarm had anything to do with it!"
5,This works!,My daughter is 9 years old and has always had to use a pull up as she had always wet at night. She is a very deep sleeper and never woke up to go to the bathroom. Within 2 weeks she was waking up dry as it was waking here up! Couple more weeks and she's done! Now sleeps in underwear and has not had an accident. This was important for her self-esteem too. Great product! Highly recommend!
2,"Good idea, ineffective execution","This product is a good idea -- in fact i was motivated to look for it partly because my bedwetting son thought that some such invention would help him stay dry. It works occasionally, but the urine doesn't hit the sensor, or the alarm does not go off, or the alarm is too feeble to be heard through my son's blanket, far too often for it to be effective. The alarm itself is so quiet that I put it in a tin cup for a while -- it is so weak that it rarely wakes me up, let alone my son, who I swear could drown before waking. If a child twists and turns during the night, it is unlikely that the clip will end up in a place where it triggers the alarm before most of the bed is sopping. I am disappointed with its lack of effectiveness. We are returning to the old ""no drinks after 4PM"" approach until we can find an effective alarm."
1,Disappointed,The first night the alarm went off and couldn't be turned off or re-set. Waste of time and money and a great source of disappointment for my son.
2,"Changing Rating from Overrated to ""It Works"".","Updated ReviewChanging rating to it works from overrated. After a rocky start, we tried again and within a few days we had success. I would say this is a process that takes few tries (depending on your kid). Now we have success. Still recommend the bed liners for quick changes in the middle of the night.Old ReviewThis is an overrated product. You should only consider purchasing if you child sleeps through the wetting. Otherwise, this is just a bit of extra feedback that confuses and annoys the situation. Consider saving your money and purchase bed liners."
1,Simply doesn't work,"I'm not a high-maintenance customer--I routinely buy and enjoy products that have mixed reviews. But this is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. Simply put, the alarm doesn't work. Sometimes it vibrates when wet. Sometimes it vibrates when dry. Sometimes it turns itself on and off randomly. The sounds don't seem to work. Other people seem to have better luck, so maybe I just got a bad one, but it feels plasticky and cheap, so I suspect yours may be as bad as mine was."
2,Great While it Lasted...,"The concept works great, but after about 3 weeks of use the alarm wouldn't shut off at night after my child urinated. I had to throw it under a bunch of towels so everyone could get back to sleep..Really disapointing as I spent a lot of money on it..oh well.. on to another brand.."
4,Worth the perspective,"It can be easy for today's youth to see the ministry models of their parents and grandparents as stuffy and ineffective. But take a look at the era depicted by Bruce McIver. Simple students started asking God how they could join Him in His work of loving the world and their complete surrender to Him led to a movement that shaped much of today's American (and now beyond) Christianity.The book does have a Baptist-specific tone and the revival model is certainly a far cry from most youth oriented ministries today. Also, in a less than polished style, it jumps around a bit and can get a little boring with the details of who served on what committeeHowever, the overall spirit of the students involved and the faithfulness they exemplified to the end of their lives is refreshing and challenging. I highly recommend it, both to young students and to their leaders... Oh God, would you see fit to use us in similar ways!"
5,yes man,"supercat the undisputed don dada drops a classic album, one of his best no doubt tough lyrics and nice beats also classic songs like Dolly My Baby and Yush Talk"
5,Rare treats!,"Hunter's tart and tasty collection of short stories cuts an unflinching swath from Ohio's steel mill towns in the 50's to the angst-ridden offices, singles apartments and gay bars of Manhattan in the 70's and 80's. Insightful and experimental, at times poignant and bitingly funny, the author's carefully crafted glimpses into the lives of men and women on the edge are worth reading again and again."
4,You've seen horror like this but this is somehow different!,"I'm a big fan of Horror flicks that involve mutated-like families that hunt down tourists, and that's pretty much what this flick is all about! A couple who happen to be broke so they decide to spend their honeymoon out hiking; unknowing their being stalked by crazy, inbred-looking (think of 'Wrong Turn'/'HATCHET' kind), wild man and woman. Sounds like the same old slasher story right.....WRONG! The flick plays out as an unsolved mystery with a host introducing the horrific story. It jumps back and fourth from the host, being present, to the honeymooners in which we see all the gory experiences! Horror fiends who enjoy 'Wrong Turn', 'HATCHET', 'The PREY'(1983), 'Rituals'(1977), 'Just Before Dawn', 'Madman', and maybe 'Hatchet for a Honeymoon' lol!"
1,Save your money,"The best thing about this movie is the fast forward button. Cheaply done, poor acting and silly looking masks (FX)."
4,Dance Mix 2,"Great fast pace workout!! But did not know that is was put into TWO seperate 30 minute workouts. I wanted a 60 minute workout. The bpm go up and then down; 2 different times. So it's hard to make an hour long workout the way that I want to. However, this is FAST PACE 30 MINUTER!!!!"
5,an excellent field guide,"This is a very intelligently laid out guide for the field. Pictures, copy and maps are all on the one page; no thumbing from picture to map to copy, as with Peterson's field guide. No space is wasted, even the inside covers are full of information, and there is a color code index. This was designed by persons who know what it is to hurry, in wind, rain or bad light, to identify a bird."
4,Perfect size,This is a very nice field guide. I especially like the indexes on the inside of the front and back cover. All field guides should be like this. It sure saves a lot of searching in the alphabetical indexes and eliminates all the post it markers I use in my other field guides. Will be going to Britain in several weeks and looking forward to getting a few lifers.Not the most detailed of guides but perfect for traveling.
1,Ki-Rist What a Horrible Experience,"The thing is too bloody busy.I found the first backup to an external drive OK, but tryingto do partial backups later on, so far, impossible. And I can read."
1,Don't Buy!,"I am very disappointed in this product. This company has so many similar products with confusingly similar names, that I ended up getting the wrong product (I should have gotten the Home version) and it won't work on my system. I was also expecting native support for writing to CD/DVD as advertised for the Home version, but that feature is frustratingly missing (and in a more expensive product to boot!). And the support is practically non-existent. I would never buy another product from Acronis again."
1,Acronis 9. written by Roxio? Updated,"I've installed this on 3 differnt computers (W2K OS) trying towrite/read from a CD. 9.0.3633 writes to CD but cant find the fileit just wrote. Cannot make a boot CD using 3 differentburners. 9.1 does not reconize a DVD burner (BenQ light scribeor any other DVD burner). Acronis 8.0 worked like a dream butlacked CD/DVD capabiliy. I've sent 2 request to Tech support, Noanswer.Update. Got an answer from Tech Support after 3 day,it wasdisable Roxio or preformat the Cd with Roxio. Tried both stilldoes not produce a CD. I am not a novice at this. But somecompanies new releases suck. Is it done in India??? Watch Sales drop."
1,Acronis made my system nonbootable,"I decided to test Acronis after I installed the software. I attempted to restore an image of my hard drive. I VERIFIED THE IMAGE BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO RESTORE. Acronis software indicated the drive image was satisfactory.Next I decided to give the software the acid test. The restore failed. I got a message indicating ""the archive is corrupted."" I could not boot my PC. I had to restore Windows using the ""recovery disc"" that shipped with the PC. My data was destroyed.In my opinion, Acronis is worse than spyware and viruses. There is no telephone number for tech support, just an Email address. They have not helped me.Do not buy Acronis unless you want your data destroyed and you want your PC unbootable."
2,Acronis Customer Support is THE WORST!,"I have spent the better part of 4 months dealing with these guys. They won't talk to you on the phone, don't let you get support until you register your product with a serial #, which, if you lose and need to re-install, you can't get without a login and a serial #. That makes no sense.I've had technical problems with True Image Home 9 and 10, and just can't get them to resolve it. Very unhappy with these guys. The product looks good, but if you have a glitch, prepare to wait A WEEK OR MORE for tech support to respond by email. Check out their web site and try some numbers - you'll find there's no way to talk to ANYONE unless you want to buy something.This is not one experience with them. It's Feb 07 now, and this charade began last August! Buyer beware."
4,It works!,I bought this product to do an image backup just in case my drive fails.About two weeks after I bought the product one of my drives did fail.I was able to place the image back on the hard drive like nothing had ever happened.Thanks
1,tech support for acronis true image 9.0,"first copy from amazon turned out to be defective and fortunately was replaced by amazon at no charge. unfortunately, until I realized this I had multiple contacts with acronis tech support, who were particularly unhelpful. When the same problem appeared with the replacement cd, the tech support emailed a simple fix in the registry and all went well. If you get a message when starting the newly installed program ""can't find a valid serial number"" and, therefore, will not start, contact the tech support and get the fix. I'll never understand why they didn't respond as well the first time."
2,Verify option says the backup is corrupted ...,"... even though the backup may be fine.This software is very flexible, powerful and full featured ... but what good does it do if you don't know if it's making a good backup?A significant subset of users report this problem over several different versions of the software. Typical customer support responses tell you things such as: Try running the verify by booting from your recovery disks, & try running your system with only 1 stick of memory."
3,Don't schedule tasks with this software,"This software works very well when you initiate a task ""manually"". However, scheduled tasks are undependable; some times they start at the time specified, other times they don't. I have corresponded with the support department, but this time they have not replied to my e-mails for one week."
2,Acronis,This was servicable. Would not buy again. Found several others that were cheaper and liked better. This was highly rated when I purchase.
4,Great product running without any issues,"I've used norton Ghost 9.0 in the past and came across frequent errors when trying to open the program and run a backup. I finally switched to Acronis and couldn't be happier. The backups run quickly and there are a lot of options for backup and compression.Acronis lacks a feature which Norton Ghost 9 included, performing full backups and automatically giving the backup set a unique name. Norton also offers to specify how many backup sets to keep at a time. Acronis will perform a full backup (overwriting the old one) and gives you the option to perform incremental backups between stages.Pros:Easy to use and understandBacks up data quicklyHas little effect on system resources when runningHas not crashed or caused an error at allCons:Inability to automatically give unique names to every full backup."
5,most incredable product ever,"I have no ties with this company but have to say this is the best product I have ever used on PCs. I work for a company of 100,000 people and we have some very large scale real time backup software but on a few mission critical areas we use this (Ture Image Server)as it has never hickuped and is so easy to use...there is only a few screens to learn...not complicated at all. I think some negative feed back here(not all) is either Norton employees or just giant norton fans but this product makes GHOST look like a joke. I was a big fan of Drive Image but Symantec did never incorporate that well into GHOST. At home and for my friends I insist they use True Image Workstation...bare metal backup ability is increadible and so so fast. Again I am not a reseller or have anyties but so far this is my favorite PC software. I would agree though that the main office is lacking....I find corporate sales the worst."
2,Works ... sort of,"This program states that it can create an image of the OS drive. But it can not restore it so that you can boot from it so what is the point. You have to install XP from the Win XP disk first than use True Image to restore the image. Bottom line, it is fine for backing up files but not creating a true OS image. I contacted customer support several times and they really were no help. Needless to say, I am very disappointed and now have to research a replacement product."
2,God I wanted this to work!,"I bought this program on the rave reviews given on multiple websites and was excited to install and make my first TI Image. Well much to my dismay the first gave a corrupted image error, so I made adjustments such as turning off all malware detection and defrag software and tried again. Same thing. As a matter of fact every image I make gives me a corrupted image error. The only thing on my machine that would be considered a non standard build would be my RAID 0 setup with 2 WD Raptor drives. Thats it. Norton and Paragon both have no issue with creating an image. I don't see why Acronis does. As I said I REALLY want to use this product, so I'm going to try version 10 and see if it works any better."
2,Acronis True Image v 9.0,I do not recommend this software. I installed the product on a system with a DVD R/RW and one of the key features of the product does not work. I attempted to create a bootable DVD to facilitate the restoration of my computer and much to my dismay this feature is not supported. The tech support is only available by e-mail and it seems to take 24 hours to get a reply. When they did reply it was apparent that the tech hadn't read my e-mail. The bottom line is that I am very unsatisfied.
4,"Reasonably easy to use, but a caveat.","It only took one hard disk crash to make me pay attention to the need to back up. I back up all files and folders at least daily to an external HD; I bought Acronis to create a disk image backup so that I could restore everything as it was to a new HD in case of a crash; I create a new disk image backup at least monthly. Warnings: run checkdisk /f before creating the disk image, to be sure there are no file errors; and veriy the backup. I tried to restore the disk image, only to discover it wouldn't restore because of file errors. Fortunately, restoring the disk image turned out not to be necessary, and I was still able to restore an important file from the backup."
1,I've revised my review.,Purchased to do a full backup of my hard drive. Seemed to install just fine but backup procedure produces nothing but error messages. Wish I had tried the trial version first. Don't buy this until you know for sure it will work with your system. Follow up: software does what it is supposed to do only when backing up to an internal hard drive. Trying to back up to an external usb or firewire drive resulted only in error messages. I would change to 3 stars if I could.
1,"No backing up, just breaking!","Tried Acronis for about 6 weeks and finally, went back to using XP Pro's back-up prog. The more than several problems I had with Acronis making back-ups. I spent a good part of 4 weeks following their tech. support guidlines. Reinstalled the product at least 3 times. It never was able to provide a backup with out an error message coming up. Finally, the computer crashed and Acronis would not let me access any files on the backup drive or my computer. I had to reformat/reinstall XP Pro.been using XP Pro's backup program now for 3 weeks (full backup and incremental backups)and it has offered no errors."
5,6 Stars if Possible!!!,"I had this on cassette back in '94 and I've been searching for it on CD for 3 years now. A must have for any true dancehall fan (and for fakers who want to impress others with their dancehall knowledge). Songs like ""Physical Attraction"", ""Scalp Dem"", and ""Mercelina"" a still run de place."
5,superb,"a wicked combination of deejays on this record, supercat and his bro junior cat and nicodemus with his bro junior demus come fi nice up the area. excellent lyrics and production (for 1994). this album is a classic. a must for all dancehall fans."
4,An excellent 3rd and a very good 4th,"BrahmsGunter WandSymphonies 3 & 4North German Radio Symphony Orchestra(RCA Victor - DDD - 1989)Wand has an excellent Third which makes this a fine CD to represent that piece, the Forth is very good but not the sole performance I would rely on.Symphony #3 = Five StarsSymphony #4 = Four StarsThis CD = Four Stars"
4,War destroys lives & never ends...,"White BadgeEnglish subtitles.A Korean film about Korean soldiers in Vietnam. The themes are familiar: effects of war after it is over and those who fought and survived went home.The film also shows the ripple effects and how those who fought were unable to live normal lives again. Everything they experience after the war is filtered through their memories of it. Families and relationships were never the same and eventually destroyed.I wondered why it is called White Badge. I think maybe it is symbolic of innocence lost.It's worth watching and a good story. A sad story. Not too many war movies made from the perspectives of Asian soldiers.It's also not surprising that humans react the same to war regardless of country, ethnicity or ideology."
1,A poor imitation,"This film is a poor imitation of Platoon and Deer Hunter. It's hard for me to believe that semi-illiterate Vietnamese farmers know how to write Korean language to demand compensation for the loss of their water buffaloes accidentally killed by Korean soldiers. You will be very disappointed if you're looking for war actions. Also, the director fails miserably to show the effects of psycholgical trauma experienced by the returning soldiers. The storyline is not well connected. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
5,Wonderful mood music,"This band has a unique sound and they sing in multiple languages too. A very peaceful CD to listen to and also energetic too. The music speaks to the spiritual listener and to the folk music lover. If you like the band Omnia, then you should try Faun too."
3,Not as good as Renaissance,"Totem just isn't as interesting as the only other Faun album I have ""Renaissance"". All the tracks are pleasant, but lack spark."
2,Look elsewhere,"This play had a short run at The Public Theater in New York last year, where I happened to catch it. While there are flashes of wit and emotion in the writing, backing up the many praises Gilman has received, the play as a whole fails to cohere. It's ostensibly about a cop who falls in love with a hooker, but the relationship never gets deeper than a lesson in botany. The exterior drama becomes more than a little kitchen-sink convenient, especially near the end.I'll admit, I haven't read or seen any other Gilman plays. But from what I hear, you may be better off working your way through them (especially CHURNING INTO BUTTER) before reading this one."
5,Beyond the expected,"I love this album, it heaves with something more than a typical raw black metal sound, and goes into the averse tree with deeper darker themes and layers to the sounds. I like this alot - for reference it is like Abruptum, and reminds me of Deathspell Omega's 'Frist Prayer' track a little - this is black metal for the Left Handed Path."
5,Superb,This is one of the best series I have ever read. It compares with the Ranger Series and with the Bernard Cornwall Sharps Series. Excellent and highly recommended.
2,Hmm...,"Waste of $$. They really tried, but in my opinion, nothing much really came out of it... After the 2nd or 3rd tune, I thought I was listening to really heavy/surf-punk metal... really BAD heavy/surf-punk metal!! Couple songs were okay. 'nough said."
1,Tribute to Pixies is really bad,"It is my opinion that the bands who are on this album may have never even heard of the pixies let alone their songs. I defy you to follow along with any the lyrics, they all sound like Hop Sing from Bonanza. (...)"
3,Not for the average reader,"I purchased this book as my husband and I are about to begin the process of opening our own Plastic Surgery Practice. While I am certain that this is an excellent read for a PhD candidate or a physician with an MBA, it is not for the average or even above average physician looking for advice and information concerning the management of a practice. It is most definitely an extremely in depth and detailed examination of all aspects of medical management. It presupposes that the reader is well-versed in fiscal policy, business law, and graduate level economics. I struggled with the book for several days before making it a gift to my brother-in-law who is an MBA student. At the core it is a textbook for a graduate business student and not for a physician."
5,Guide to Gears from the Greeks,"If you want to study the Antikythera Mechanism, this is where to start. It is helpful if you have a background in mechanics and in astronomy. The work is 70 pages, and should be read methodically. There are a few irregularities here and there, but they do not detract from the total work. You will then appreciate this exceptional and perceptive work. To get you started: General background: pgs. 51-62 (esp. 56-60); Description of the device: pg. 13, col II; Photos: mostly pgs. 23-26; Drawing of case: pg. 17; Gearing diagrams: flat: pgs. 37-40; side: pg. 43. This side drawing by Beverly Pope is the ""holy grail,"" normally seen in descriptions. To further you on your quest, join the gears with the question marks beside them..."
3,Small diameter piping but Adequate for the Price,"I got this product at Lowe's for $29.68. I used longer, larger pan head screws with 6' pressure treated 2x4 base lumber. Total price with lumber was about $35.00. The pipe is smaller in diameter than the other firewood rack I have. The other rack includes the base and is selling for well over $50.00. In order to compensate for what seems to be flimsy pipe size, I added a length of heavy duty rope tied between the tops of the supports. It is definitely not coming apart now. I'm satisfied with it for the money and if needed, I can replace the support rope every few years. Because in my opinion it requires ""field engineering"" to make it right, I believe it only deserves 3 stars."
4,"Simple, effective design","Assembled unit with regular 2X4 studding material. Measured the custom width I needed for the rack. Cut a set of 2X4 rails out of one 2X4X8 length and used left over piece for a 'T' brace between the the 2X4 rails. Filled rack to the top with wood. A little flex on the rails but feels sturdy enough. It works...Note: You supply the screws. Also, because studding 2X4s are less than 2"" X 4"", there is some ""slop"" in the rail slot openings - they are larger - closer to a ""real"" 2X4 size. Not a problem but worth noting."
2,Lightweight P.O.S!!!!!!!,"This product starting bending with wood stacked halfway up. The welds seem insufficient where you would attach it to the 2 X 4. So unless your stacking small dry pine limbs, look for another product."
1,lrsdodgers,The item I received was damaged. It had obviously was returned by another cutomer and then sent to me. Very disappointed in the condition of the product. Would return but too heavy to return. Would not recommend this seller.
2,Was a gift and wasnt in a plain amazon box so surprise was ruined,"I ordered this product as a xmas gift and picked the ""gift"" option when checking out but it was delivered in the actual box with the picture of the product and all so needless to say the surprised was ruined and that it is very upsetting..i havent actually used it yet considering its not xmas yet and the person cant have it until then so i cant comment on the actual product..but shipment was very disappointing. way to ruin xmas considering half of my gifts from amazon werent in plain boxes"
3,Smaller then I thought...,I bought these because I thought they were the same size as the one I already own. They are not. In fact they are too narrow for any but the flattest surface. How do I know? I returned to my house one day to find all my logs on the ground!
5,log rack,The item is very useful. the ability to use simple 2x4 lumber to make the unit the correct lenght is great.
5,Adjustable log rack,Much cheaper than the unit I saw at Home Depot. Log rack arrived early. I just purchased two 2X4 10 foot boards at Home Depot and assembled the rack in about 20 minutes.
5,wood rack,stable secure perfect for me got 16 foot 2x4 s and got a lot of wood stacked on a concrete porch
5,Log Rack,Nice rack. Was extremely easy to assemble. Used two 8' pressure treated 2X4's and will attach a middle support piece for length support. Highly recommend.
2,Ho Hum Regurgitation of past works,poor Photos from the 1950s-60sinnacurate descriptions of many homesToo similar to older works on the same homesMissing many important historic homes of Somersetwhile listing insignificant onesReminds me of those books that locals pay to be in.
2,A small wind-up travel clock.,"A small clock that does not take up a lot of space or need batteries. One complaint I have with it is that the windup keys are too close to the other knobs for setting the time and alarm. Also, the clock windup key is hard to wind, and the edges of the key become painful as it digs into your fingers. It has a windup key for the clock, a windup key for the alarm, a knob for setting the time, a knob for setting the alarm, and a tiny plastic knob for turning the alarm on and off. That makes five controls in a small amount of space. Not made for anyone with large hands. I was spoiled by the older and larger Big Ben alarm clock that had more spacing around the button, knob and windup key due to the combining of the clock and bell in one windup key, the combining of the time and alarm settings in one knob, along with a long metal alarm button.

4,good in-the-woods sharpener,"to touch up a saw chain, where there are no outlets this is the ticket . . . the angle and depth settings let you keep your cutters uniform; but it won't touch a chain that has been into rocks and dirt and is completely dull."
1,Cracked Aluminum casting,"After using mine for 3 months the body cracked in half. Aluminum casting just didn't hold up. Until it broke in half, it worked great, sharpest bade ever, not quite like new but closer then any other method."
3,My class loved it,This book is good and interesting.I liked it but it was weird. I think you should read it.
4,Good Book,'This Side of Paradise' by Steven Layne was a very good book. It's about two brothers named Jack and Troy who move to a community named Paradise because their dad gets a new job. Everything in Paradise seems like it's perfect; but it's not. The plot of this book was very suspenseful and mysterious. There are many cliffhangers that keep you wanting to read more of this book.
5,ok,"I read THIS SIDE of PARADISE and I thought it was a great book. I liked it because it had action and it made you think what was going to happen next. I like to read book that have horror, action, and suspsion. I also liked it because it had teenagers and showed there ways of thinking."
1,Insulting,"I went into this book with an open mind and I still hated it. The plot is stupid and the characters are plastic. Here is my summary:The kids fight with their stupid, angry father. He then brings them to a place called paradise which is a perfect society. The son falls in love with some girl after a minute of seeing her and that is really there only time together, but yet they are deeply in love somehow.It is so stupid that Jori ( a girl )works there because an android should work there... Like I said so many flaws"
4,A gem of book !,"If one surveys martial arts books they will quickly find that few books have been written that specifically deal with the subject of pressure points and nerve centers. Mr. Tegner weeds through the myths and heresay surrounding this subject and succeeds in presenting a realistic view of vital point striking. He avoids the hype (unlike the ""death touch"" books) and gives the reader an idea of what can be expected and accomplished from the exploitation of these anatomical targets in a very easy to understand format. (Let's face it, a 250lb man will certainly do more damage than a 120lb woman). Should be read by every martial artist"
3,To high of expectations,I read this book and my reccomendation is that you lower the price because it is not worth even the little amount that is being payed at the moment. Other then the price I think this book has good instuctions on the nerve points but compared to The Encyclopedia of Dim-mak it rates only about a 3 star. Being a Jujitsu Sensei I think that the Atemi-Waza was not bad but needed some more definition. This is a good book to read but not much more.
3,Uncolorful.,"Nerve Centers and Pressure Points shows vague points, and focuses more on the utilitarian side of martials arts. Leaving out the actual art."
2,A mix of the obvious and the incorrect.,This book is not at all useful to practicing martial artists. Save your money.
5,Great product but very misrepresented,This is a great product if you are a FIBROMYALGIA patient. It removes the fibro fog we experience and allow your legs and arms to feel a part of you body.
4,Bolova Watch,"Overall we are pleased with this product. I would have preferred to have known that it is made in China before purchasing the watch. I probably would have made the purchase anyway, but would have factored that into my decision. The ""diamonds"" are essentially a non item as far as the eye can perceive. Don't buy this if they are important to you."
1,Choppy animation. Definitely not worth it.,I purchased this video with all three volumes of X-Mix and was hugely disappointed by all 4 of the videos.The reason I purchased these videos was because years ago I had purchased Atmospherex Exotic Robotics and absolutely loved the fluid graphics and the way to moved to the music. I wanted more. And bad. So I purchased these expecting the same.The graphics were horrible and choppy. The visuals didnt seem to respond to the music. I was completely startled because I read such other positive reviews. How can anyone call this mind tingling and fluid? Thus far I think Atmospherex is the only company (of the 3 whose products I've tried) that has it right.
5,Yoichiro Kawaguchi Showreel,"The computer animation shorts of Yoichiro Kawaguchi have been a feature of the ACM SIGGRAPH Electronic Theater for over 10 years. Some of the shorts are available on VHS through the Association of Computing Machinery, however, this DVD features an extended selection of the Kawaguchi material, that is hard to find anywhere else. The technical quality far exceeds that found on VHS and all the material is presented continuously rather than scattered among various SIGGRAPH tapes. For fans of abstract computer animation and electronic music, it does not get much better than this."
3,Very nice but not the best I've seen.,"This presentation is fluid and vibrant, but it is almost entirely sphere-based animation, so there is not a lot of variation on the general theme. Also there are points in the video where it is obvious that the DVD was generated from analog originals. Overall it definately kept my attention and the music was excellent."
4,This is definately eye-candy!!!,"This is quite the deal for those searching for a visual treat! Even though Tangerine Dream isn't my bag, it was still a nice perk for purchasing this DVD title. I found this title from the folks of Mind's Eye to be very hypnotic, and it's versatile with just about any genre of music. My only complaint is that some of the images get a little repetitive, hence the 4-star grade."
5,"Yes, did meet my requirements","Yes it did meet my expectations, its been used a lot, a no negative comments I had said about it so far."
5,Works extremely well,I'm not a doctor or a nurse. We bought these so that (after a training lesson from my sister in law the R.N.) we could tell if our daughters lungs sounded OK or if it was time to take her in to the doctor. You can hear very well indeed with these. The rubber earpieces that come with them are very comfortable and block out surrounding sound very well. Definitely happy with this purchase!
4,Good,The scope has very good sound. The color is true to the choice of color that I made. I like having the extra parts.
5,Enjoyable book,"I bought this book because my ancestor was in the 123rd IL, and both regiments fought together for a period of time as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade. I found it very interesting as to how the soldiers lived day-to-day as well as descriptions of battles. This is more interesting than reading a more scholarly description of the war. The author, who was better educated than most enlisted soldiers, and later became a school teacher and newspaper publisher, was an excellent writer."
2,Good but cannot cut~!,"I like this item but if you do try to cut it to size, most likely it will leak. I have to make 4 cuts and only 1 did not leak. Other than that they work well. I need more but will not use these again. I will search for something similar from another company.TO this company - your advertising is false. You need to fix the product or remove the statement that they can be cut."
4,A Feast for the Eyes,"I have had this book on loan from the public library for over six weeks and can't bare to part with it. The library wants their copy back, so I'm going to have to buy my own. I was attracted to the book, not because I wanted guidance in painting the interior of my house, but because as an amateur artist and photographer, I am interested in color theory. The palettes of these interior and exterior settings as they relate to natural light is inspirational and beautiful. This is not a ""how-to"" book, but offers scope for the imagination. I tend to paint all my interior rooms off-white because I think that brings more light into the room. This book challenges that thinking by demonstrating through photographs of rooms in the natural light of various geographic areas how nature works with the color palette to illuminate interiors. The text supplements the photographs by explaining how this works. I like this book very much."
1,YUK,"THIS IS REALLY UNAPPEALING. THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED THE BOOK ""ATMOSPHERE FOR BEIGE ROOMS."" IF YOU WANT A HOUSE WITH ALL THE CHARM OF ""BUILDER BEIGE,"" THEN GO FOR IT. OTHERWISE, KEEP LOOKING FOR A REAL BOOK ON COLOR. (I HAVEN'T FOUND ONE I LIKE YET.)"
3,Miricle of the Desert,"This book mainly pertains to the area around Blackfoot to Aberdeen Idaho. There isn't much on the desert known as ""the Snake River Plain"" and towns such as Cero Grande, Pioneer, Tabor etc. There is a lot of history of the Blackfoot area and the area just north of the Snake River in that vicinity. This is a hard to find book so if you are interested it might provide the history you are looking for."
5,Hilarious Ren & Stimpy pay homage to the holidaze!,"As a mother of 3 teenaged boys (13, 15 & 17) I buy all kinds of music. No collection is complete without Comedy during Christmas! We bought ""Crock O' Christmas"" last year (97) when the original voices were still making their albums, and loved it! Our friends and family cracked up when they heard it. Now we sing their songs as we drive down the road... ""We wish you a hairy chestwig..."", humming the holiday tunes. Guess what they're getting for Christmas this year. Enjoy, joy!"
5,Awsome Album,"I have This Album on Cassette From Back in the day and i still play it its halirous im going to be playing it at the family christmaas party this year. One of the best songs on this album is fleck the walls, were going shopping and a wizzleteats kind of christmas. Kids love this and they dont even know who the charectors are. So i say yes by this album on CD or Cassette Its worth every cent."
3,Joy! I got my copy autographed!,"This wasRen & Stimpy's Christmas album. It's feature their usual nonsense. It is pretty funny, but doesn't really rank among their best work. Some of the humor seems rather ""forced"". The absence of Ren & Stimpy's creator, John Kricfalusi, hurts the product. But Ren & Stimpy fans will still probably enjoy it."
5,Excellent Album,"I can't remember where I heard of Frou Frou but I bought her cd and it is absolutely wonderful. Anyone who likes, anything mellow, yet a bit mysterious, would love this album. I would reccommend also any album from Enya, Bjork, or Enigma. This may be one of those rare albums that you will never get tired of listening to. Once again, This is ONE GREAT album!"
2,Mimicry.,"I cannot listen to an album that *BLATANTLY* sounds like another artist's repertoire, and I sorta can't understand how anyone can.Sure, Thom yorke from Radiohead is very reminicant of Jeff Buckley, but he's not a CLONE.But, this woman's voice sounds EXACTLY like Sarah Mclachlan's voice. Every time she hits a note, I can't help but think this.And Besides, Sarah Mclachlan's ""Surfacing"" has way more substance than this, anyway.I am seeing people compare her to Dido's singing; I don't really see that.Whether she was *trying* to sound like Mclachlan or not, Either way, If it was me, I would at least *try* to set myself apart, if only slightly."
4,Chill with Frou Frou,"Frou Frou is a mix of electronica and pop unlike anything similar because of Imogene's whispery lead vocals. The single ""Let Go"" is only the tip of the iceberg on this album. Be sure to check out tracks ""Breathe In"", ""Must Be Dreaming"" and ""Flicks"". Great chill out music.If you are looking for something a little different than the typical pop you hear on the radio give this album a try. You'll be happy you did."
4,Great to unwind to.,"I really like this one. I would not only purchase one if I lost mine, but would give it to several friends as a gift. (which I will soon)."
5,just what i was waiting for!,"this album is a perfect marriage of trip-hoppy, downtempo-spacey pop. If you like Bjork, Esthero, Dido, Everything But The Girl or Depeche Mode, you will probably love this album. Imogen Heap and Guy Sigsworth have done a great job with this album, and I really hope we see more from them in the future. Highlights are Psychobabble, The Dumbing Down Of Love, and Only Got One. But really, it's all good, there isn't a weak track on here."
5,Pure Techno-Chic delight,"I have been an Imogen Heap fan from way back (imagine that, and an American too!) This new collaboration is nothing short of genius. Of course, I am biased as I love this woman. Her haunting voice, unique instrumentations, and her pithe lyrics make this album a must! Imogen does not dwell on the woeful, ""feel sorry for me"" attitude. She is strong and beautiful."
5,Great Debut!!!,"Details, the debut from the duo known as Frou Frou is a very good one. Imogen's voice reminds me a lot of Dido's. Although with a more folky tone. The reason I picked up this CD was because of the song ""Breathe In"", which I so adore.... I love that song. ""Let go"" and ""Must be dreaming"" are other highlights on this CD. I guess you could describe this music as more of pop than anything else, but even that is kind of a mismatch in terms of description. I would say that you can't go wrong with this CD. At first there were about 2 songs that I didn't care for on this CD, but since then they have grown on me and this has got to be one of the best CD's in the last few months that I've picked up. I'm looking forward to more of this duo in the future because they are starting something that has the potential to be great!"
3,Inconsistently stunning but altogether very good,"3 1/2Yes, it all cannot live up to the intensely and dramatically beautiful starting track (with a few more included), nor does it try to. But with layered, intelligent production, and Heap's personal delivery, even casual mid-tempo numbers closer to autopilot resonate with authenticity."
4,Good album...not great.,"Good music. Only a couple really great songs. I wish the whole album was in the ""great"" category...unfortuantely this one is not."
2,Natalie Merchant meets Portishead,"Singer's voice sounds way to much like Natalie Merchant for my tastes. To popish with only light influence of bands like Zero Seven and Portishead. More of a Zero-Seven light. In short, mostly boaring and bland with a few catchy tunes here and there."
1,"tedious, fluffy dribble, insufferable...","Man, I scanned through many of the 4~5 star reviews on this album, thinking, ""Yeah, this looks like a good possibility...""Honestly, I could not make it past the 3rd cut. Then played 10 seconds of the next couple tracks, and 'click,' out it came from my player. I want my money back.Horrible. Dreck. Contrived, utterly forgettable crap of the highest order.Does she have a nice voice? Do we have competent production value? Sure. But it's like special effects in a film. If there is no story they can't carry the film.I love good downtempo/trip hop/acid jazz, etc. I listen to a lot of Massive Attack, Tricky, Morcheeba, Air, Portishead, Kruder & Dorfmeister, Amon Tobin, Zero 7, etc... Sorry, this disk ain't anything approaching this stuff.I can't fathom how this album got so many favorable reviews."
1,Frou Frou is like a dream man!,"For starters, I wouldn't give this such a bad rating if the album was sincere. I had a suspension when I saw all the advertising. This album makes you go ""Hey what's this,"" but goes no where. Every song sounds exactly the same. But that really is the only response that I can honestly have after listening to it the multiple times. The music feels so right, but has no substance whatsoever, almost in a similiar way to the lyrics. Please if you have any respect for the artists that this album is trying to emulate, don't give in to this manufactured crap. Dig deeper. If not go watch Garden State. If you may allow me to leave you with some lyrics from this album, I will end this review:Well painted passion...You rightly expect...Impersonation...The dumbing down of love..."
1,Boring and not suitable for people who are in a good mood...,"I was totally disappointed when I listened to this album....I thought that it would be the hit of the year (since all this advertising,talking and reveiw of how Frou Frou are great.)...I listened to the first couple of tracks and thought that they were a song......Even the lyrics are not that good...They are not characterized or understandable...I think that they were all written in one session...and express nothing !!!I don't care about what people say about them...This is my reveiw..and I'm really disappointed.......There is nothing that cheers me up like a beautiful song...with nice vocals and listenable tones..and in this certain album......all I found is a long sleepy song.....unforgetable regret and a smile on the cover that makes me sick.This is no good....This is something you'll be fed up in one day...Advice: Save your money ...save your time..save your EAAARRRS!!!"
4,Details,"Frou Frou is never a disapointment. Her unique voice mixed with electronic genious, a perfect match."
3,A few good tracks...,"I liked it, but just didn't get into it. ""Breathe In"" however, is almost worth buying the whole album for."
4,"Good, but try her solo work instead","Frou Frou is good stuff, don't get me wrong. There's definitely a BJork and Dido feel floating around some of the songs, so that can't be a bad thing. However, beyond the first two tracks (the first of which introduced most of us to Frou Frou, in the soundtrack of ""Garden State""), barely four years after the release of the album most of it fails to survive the test of time, feeling too much like overproduced pop-electronica.Still, since Frou Frou's beautiful voice (Imogen Heap) does stand out, I would recommend you look elsewhere, in her solo production (above all, the album ""Speak For Yourself""), so you can enjoy what she's capable of when she doesn't sound overproduced."
2,Placid at Best,"There is a lot of hype surrounding this cd. Her solo stuff is fun for the novelty, but this album is BORING. Minus the slight variations in the chinsy little audio effects added to the production, the songs on this album all sound the same. What's better? Cat Power, Liz Janes, Fiona Apple, Tegan and Sara to name a few. The Garden State soundtrack broke a few artists that were worth the attention. Frou Frou wasn't one of them."
4,beauty in it's purest form,"ahhhh frou frou. oh how i love this cd. it puts me in such a WONDERFUL mood. they combine everything i love about all of my favorite artists. they have madonna's pop sensibilty and seals atmospheres. it reminds me so much of bjork, minus her sometimes annoying vocal traits, which is never a bad thing. no matter what kind of mood i may be in, this cd has something for me to play. it's just gorgeous. the only downside for me is that it's a bit TOO poppy. but oh well. get it!"
3,Frou Frou,Track 1 and Track 4 are the best songs on the CD. She has a nice voice so if you want to relax this is a good CD to listen to.
4,Frou Frou's unique sound,"I actually bought this album because I wanted something new to add to my collection. I definitely have to say that this album is really good!!! I love her voice it is absolutely amazing. Her voice is hypnotizing. There isn't a bad song on the album, I would recommend this album for people who want something to listen to when they're working out or just wanting to sit back and relax. Because her voice is so versatile, it's hard not to find an occassion for the album. Frou Frou did a great job making this album."
5,Brillant!!,"I fist ran into Frou Frou on a boring night, flipping channels. They were interviewing them and then showed a preview of their music, ever since then i've been drawn to it. I went on a rampage and found their album. I played it constantly, even my brother knew the songs! They are a great combination of electronica and pop. Imogen's voice is like no other. It's breathy and gentle. The lyrics are catchy in certain songs and the beats are (pardon me for sounding cliche) awesome. I don't know why this isn't played on the radio, they are so much better than what's out there. I was glad to hear their song on ""Garden State."" They are the best and they should definitely be heard."
5,Superb,"If Imogen Heap could sing any more beautifully, I'd probably CRY. Her voice is so unique and resounds with so much passion. The entire CD is just amazing and ""The Dumbing Down of Love"" has to be one of the prettiest, most fragile love songs ever. Give it a listen because it's more than worth it."
4,Great speakers for the money,"Used these speakers to replace the stock speakers in my 2007 Mustang Convertible with the Shaker 500. They fit the spaces perfectly, once the speaker mount tabs were removed. Excellent sound, highs much crisper than the stocks, plus better sound on the upper bass frequencies.A great improvement in overall sound quality.Definately recommend them."
3,John Travolta is awesome !,"The man can sing and act, what more can you ask for! Sure the music is old, but it will always be good. I would like to see his singing career take off again."
1,Not a happy camper,It has been over a month since I ordered. Cannot get any information about where my CD is. Did not make the Christmas stocking it was intended to stuff :-(
4,Surprises,"This compact disc features a live performance of this 1960's band. However, it's from a 1974 reunion concert,thus,that's where the surprises begin. The most pleasant surprise was hearing 9 previously unrealeased songs from the band. These songs weren't even on the Brummels 1975 reunion album. The song genres range from country to rock to funk and a few other things. The other main surprise of this performance is how the band sounds. They do sound like a 1970's band. This is mainly acheived because of the 2 guitars players. They are using all sorts of interesting guitar effects such as wah-wah pedals. As a guitarist who has just gotten into using effects I find this educational. Occasionally, this performance gets slightly ragged, but overall it is quite satisfying. And Sal Valentino's voice is as good as it was during the 1960's. In my opinion song highlights include Turn Around/Singing Cowboy, Lisa Queen of a Magazine, & Don't Talk To Strangers."
3,Acceptable because it is inexpensive,"On the plus side, the EVA Foam protector is inexpensive and very easy to hang without drilling a lot of holes in your wall. The downside is that it is not very thick, so often times our darts will penetrate and nick the wall behind the foam protector. Also, the product image suggests that the foam protector is a single, solid piece, when in reality it is constructed from four pieces that velcro together. This means darts can penetrate between the pieces and hit the wall directly, and also that it doesn't look quite as solid and square-like as the image suggests. Overall, this product is acceptable because it is so inexpensive, but I can't rave about it."
2,Are you kidding me? Sound quality is NOT remastered,"The sound on this is atrocious. This has to be either a test copy or a well designed bootleg. I found this and several like it at a used shop, and while the song selection is great, it sounds like low quality mp3's highly compressed. with no real low or high end. If this is remastered from the tapes, the guy doing the job should be fired."
3,Reading this book is like getting your gums scraped.,"Unfortunately, I had to read this book for a class on Chaucer. The book is an unbiased, fact-filled historical account of what is known about Geoffrey Chaucer. It includes a mind-numbing string of references to actual documents related to Chaucer, anything that mentioned him. It is not exciting. It is not fun to read. The good thing is that the author does not take it upon himself to make Chaucer into some kind of hero, or super-poet."
4,Deeply,I thought that this was a good movie. I just saw it and I don't think it was like the Titanic. It had a very different story line. Yes there was an old lady but the things that the last reviewer pointed out were done in a totally different style. And what movies now are original? Anyway it's good. And Kirsten Dunst does a great job. And So did Trent Ford who played James her love interest. And Lynn Redgrave from the PBS Mystery Theater is the perfect person for the part.
2,A good movie is in there somewhere,"Found this in a bargain bin. I see quite a few movies a year and never heard of it. Now that I've seen it, I know why. It's a mess. Either the director or editor made a mess of what could have been a good film. Very obviously influenced by James Cameron's ""Titanic"", the direction leaves you wondering several times why did we get to this next scene? What just happened? Why did that character do that? Some of the dissolves were messy as well. I bought it because I think that Kirsten Dunst and Lynn Redgrave are two brilliant actresses, but unfortunately because of the storyline, never get to act with each other. The under story was the biggest mess with the character's mom and boyfriend almost afterthoughts. It could have been better."
1,The Story to no where,"Just finished watching this, not sure what the writer had to say here except maybe: A haunted island with a lame secret. Let's cast hottie Kirsten Dunst in it and maybe it'll be great. Don't waste your time on a story that makes little sense. Pretentiously trying to act like it's a ""Deep"" story. The ending of this film is so pathetic. Hey I'm sucker for a good love story but believe me this ain't it."
3,The Score,The Score made the movie. Has anyone found a CD soundtrack for this movie(DEEPLY)? Devin did you find one?
2,Not a Winner,This movie was horrible. Kirsten Dunst is my favorite actor and I just had to see it. Well now I know why it did not make it to theatres. The movie had a stupid plot about the fish going away and the town blaming a girl. Take my word and definately don't see it!
4,Unoriginal,"The only reason I watched this is because Kirsten is in it and I love her. It's a good movie with a nice story line. But it's very unoriginal. Like it's trying to be Titanic. The 3 main comparisons:1:Grandma tells story of when she was young2:Tragedy at sea3:The scene when James drowns, at the end, is the same as when Jack drownsKirsten disappoints her fans with being unoriginal."
3,An Okay Movie,"After recently watching the movie Deeply, I can tell you that this movie is extremly predictable. I kept trying to see what it was rated, but the movie was 'un-rated'. As a guide, I would say anybody over the age of 13 should be okay with this movie. I hope this review helps you!P.S.- This is not a good movie if you are looking for a comedy, drama, or romance(well, maybe a little). Also, I think I would watch this movie again if given the opportunity."
2,Suck,"THis movie sucks, hate it.. the only good thing about this movie is Kirsten Dunst's acting,she is so cute!i give 2 stars for the beautiful image! other than that this is a pathetic "" story"", a movie who gives ppls no HOPE ! But i have to say director Sophia Co is very talented!"
2,6 months of Use - Disappointment,"My old Dewalt died and I needed a new drill.I have several pieces of Hitachi equipment so I figured I would stick with the brand.This drill is complete waste. The biggest problem I have is with the chuck. It is constantly slipping and losing grip on the bit.No matter how much I tighten it, it always comes loose. You can have the best drill in the world, but if it doesnt hold bits properly - its useless.Skip this drill and get something else."
3,GUNFIGHTER45LC,WAS A LITTLE BEAT UP BUT WORKS FINE AND IT DID THE JOB THANK YOU PASSED IT ON TO MY TWIN BROTHER
1,its basically a toy,"good price, but other then that drill was really a waste of money. It broke. After about 3 months of basic around the house projects which it worked fine for, but as soon as i took it to a side job i was doing (roofing a patio)which all i needed the drill to do was screw about 500 already set 2 1/2 inch screws reinforcing the already nailed on roof. The 2 batteries it came with charged relatively quick and lasted for a while as long as it was not set on ""2"" and the drilling setting. Oh the flashlight it came with was good so i guess if your looking for a rechargeable flashlight with a worthless drill combo pack this is what u want everyone else who's looking for a good drill DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,Good cordless drill for a home owner/ hobbyist/ but terrible battery life,"This is a good package for those in search of a decent drill/flashlight package. One of the things I like most about this drill, is that it is very comfortable to use. The battery life is not great in my opinion, but with it coming with 2 batteries and they charge pretty quickly, this is a very adequate cordless drill for projects around the house. I use it a lot for wood working projects that require moderate amounts of drilling. This drill does have very good power for 14.4 volts. For heavy duty and professional use, I would recommend going with 18V drills. / Update after a little over a year of light use and properly maintained batteries, the batteries are junk. I am particular about battery maintenance and these ones do not hold up well at all. Not a bad drill, but spend a little more money and get better equipment. I will not throw good money after bad on new batteries for this unit."
5,best for the money,"I install cabinets for a living. I use cordless drills all day long, every day. After trying several brands, i have found that most are similar. The best attribute to the hitachi is the price. When the batteries are worn out, it is cheaper to buy a new drill(with 2 batteries and a charger) than to replace other brands batteries. I own three 14.4 volt drills, and one 12 volt impact driver. The impact driver lacks power."
2,skip it,I own a lot of Hitachi power tools and like them all - until this drill came along. The battery doesn't last and is only powerful enough to place long screws in wood for 3 or 4 screws. My twelve year old Dewalt 12V is stronger and lasts longer (i bought the Hitachi because the price of it was about that of a new DeWalt battery - should have clued me in).I do love the way it handles. If you need a drill for around the home that is not used extensively this may be a great buy. If you are a heavy user don't do this to yourself.
5,Excellent Drill,This drill has plenty of power for any job. I used it to go through 2 2x4's as I needed to run some electrical wire for a transfer switch. It went through the studs easily and the compact design made it lighter and easier to handle. I wasn't using a paddle bit but a hole saw so the drill has the power. I have a Craftsman cordless drill that is larger and heavier that wasn't able to handle the job. This drill comes with 2 gear settings low and high which also made the job easier. I really like the flashlight as it has a flat base and the adjustable head allowed me to point the light where I needed it. While I didn't have to charge the batteries after this use having a 30 minute charger means I will never be without power.
5,Hitachi Drill/Driver Kit,"Excellent product for the money paid. I have a business that we use this product in frequently. It holds a charge for a long time, has great torque when driving into to hard wood, and the bits to me were just a plus."
4,Functional but ugly,"I needed a driver set to install an outdoor combination lock for a spare set of keys. I saw this on sale and decided, OK, I will try it out. When the set arrived, the batteries were mostly dead. I charged each battery for about 10 minutes and it worked great.As I say in my title though, the color is pretty awful, but the drill feels solid."
2,Battery Life Questionable,"I bought this set about three years ago. The NICAD batteries are already unable to hold a charge for more than a few days with no use and only minutes with. The batteries were almost fully discharged before recharging all along, so memory should not be a problem. My Makita LI-ION drill , almost the same age, is much more powerful and the charges hold for weeks. From an environmental standpoint the NICAD technology should probably be retired and it's cheaper to buy a whole new drill set than try to replace the batteries."
1,Poor battery life,The battery life is very poor. The charger does not keep the battery charged. Battery goes dead just standing in the drill after 1 day.I would not recommend this drill to anyone. It's the biggest piece of junk I have bought. I will be buying Dewalt from now on.
2,light duty,"i like the compact size and balance, but it's not tough enough for everyday use. I have only had it a month or so and i dropped it from an attic onto a subfloor(accidentally) and the case broke and also the trigger. My Dewalt has fallen further than that onto concrete without breaking."
2,Skip it and buy a Lithium-ion instead,"I've owned this for several years, but got only a year or usage out of it before the first battery would no longer hold a charge. The cost of a replacement battery was half the price of a new unit. The second battery still holds a charge, but it needs to sit in the recharger between uses or it's worthless. Even then at full charge it's only good for a half-hour or less. Forget to leave it in the charger and the next time you need it, it's guaranteed dead. On the other hand my Black & Decker which uses a lithium-ion battery works great, doesn't need to be constantly recharged and doesn't lose it's charge through non use. On top of that I paid slightly less for it that the Hitachi drill, though it didn't include a flashlight. Bid deal! The Hitachi worked okay when it worked, but beyond that I have nothing positive to say about it."
5,great drill!,"This was one of my first drills and it works great. I am a hobbyist and this works great. I bought it solely on the reviews, that this is one the best reasonable priced drills with power and so far its true.I have been buying other Hitachi products because of this drill. Those other products didnt always rate up but this one is still going.The light is a regular bulb and could use updating to a high power LED but otherwise this is a good buy."
1,What I think of the Hitachi,"The drill is smaller and lighter than most 14.4 volt drills. I like that. The coloring of the drill looks like a pair of tenis shoes, which I don't like. It has enough power, so now all it has to do is hold up and not break and I'll be happy.Richard Curry, Ca,"
2,SMALL SMALL SMALL!,This is very well made and very warm....if you have a tiny child's head. Otherwise it will squash your nose down in a very uncomfortable way. Even my wife can't wear it.
4,Well ploted and acted episodes,"Children of Auron sees another, not too credible, side of Servalan and the deaths of numerous hench men.Rumours of death is an excellent well plotted conspiracy story. Shot on location in a large country house, the plot centres around Servalan's address to the federation and the conspiracies to kill her.Avon's (Paul Darrow) exchanges with Shrinker open the episode and makes extremely entertaining viewing. One of the best Blake's 7 episodes I have been fortunate enough to see."
3,Tassimo Coffee Review,Terrific - easy to use and great taste. Only complaint is that the price is MUCH too high.
2,Christmas gift,"I thought I was buying a coffee maker which would be very convient for my mother. I did not realize how hard it was for her to get the t disks. Not everyone shops on line, especially at age 76. She lives in another state, in a rural area and is just too hard for her to find these disks. Also I have never been able to find Maxwell house disks for her"
3,Aiptek battery,"I was somewhat disappointed in the product. The battery I received was an OEM Aiptek but was only 1000ma capacity as opposed to the 1200ma that is standard on my A-HD camcorder. The technical info did not include the capacity, which I should have recognized as a reason to check further. I got what I paid for, I just didn't get the information I should have in order to make an informed decision."
4,Just what I needed,I bought this battery for a friend and they love it . I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a new battery for their aiptek digital camcorders .
2,NOT an identical replacement battery,"This battery is not exactly the same as the original, and does not seem to have the record time expected."
3,Okay so far - still figuring it out,The first time it was used it only worked like 3 minutes in the camera. We are trying a few different things.
2,La paloma,"The purchase went very smoothly. I believe Amazon.com was responsible for that. The music on the CD was excellent, however, the CD itself was unsatisfactory. There are some blank areas as well as other areas which makes the sound not of good quality. I believe the technical aspect of the recording was less than good. This type of problem makes you not buy CD's."
4,"Not bad, if you know what your Buying","First, this is a Filler between Season One, and Season Two. It tells you that. It recaps the whole first Season, than goes into a funny, but short story about Valkrie, and her friend doing a game to see if their ready to be married. It's not that bad, and if you take it for what it is, it's an important part of the WHOLE story, which is in it's 4th season.It's Cheap, and if your collecting the season's, than you need this to complet the collection.This DVD is not a stand alone story, it's apart of a bigger picture, and this is used only to fill the time, while they were making season two."
1,Waste of money,"I bought the first three dvds in the series and i thought they were pretty good so i had to get the last volume of ufo, i was wrong.At the low price of 19.99 all i get is 1 new episode it says 60 minutes on the box but 30 minutes of is a recap of all the other episodes which is a rip off to me, but youll just have to decide if its worth the money to you."
2,Average,"Not a very funny anime...I would've given it a 2.5, but there is no rating for that. The animation is good, but the comedy just doesn't work. It tries to do too many things and then there is repetition, which isn't good when the material wasn't good to begin with. I bought this thinking it would be a hit like ""love hina"" (another harem anime), at least the best thing I can say is the series gets better from dvd vol 1, which is saying a lot."
5,A brilliant piece of music,"This amazing piece of music gets finally the major release its deserves: 10'59"" of pure electro bliss addiction, with distorted vocals by Joyce Sims. This record is simply unbelievable. Love it."
5,Absolute spledour,"What to say, what to say. Pure electronic enjoyment, a track making your head spin in seconds, driving you to the boundries of unsanity. Great vocals, wonderful bleeps, all a good track needs, a must have for all music appreciators."
5,Very nice story,This book was required reading for a course I'm taking. I'm glad it was. Beautifully written. Believable. A happy ending. What more can a reader ask for?
5,Great Book!,"This is a great ""SHORT"" book for someone who has a 10 to 14 yr old girl. My daughters are not readers, and this book works great because it is short and wonderful for mandatory book reports in school. We bought the movie also. The story is very compelling and my girls were actually interested in what was going to happen next! That works for me!!!!"
4,Pictures of Hollis Woods,"Hollis Woods is a 12-year-old orphan who has run away from every foster home she's ever lived in. As a last-ditch effort, she is placed with an elderly lady who is ""good with girls like you."" In her new home, Hollis is finally happy, until she realizes that her foster mother has a fading memory, and she must hid this fact from the state in order to stay where she is. This book is simply precious. Hollis seems so real--snarky but sad, brave but insecure, and willing to do whatever it takes to care for her foster mother. This short book could be appreciated by adults as well as people in 5-8th grades."
4,Pictures Of Hollis Woods,"The book Pictures Of Hollis Woods is about a girl named hollis who is a foster child. When ever she moves toa a new house she has these pictures in her head. The pictures are of her past, the familys she used to live with, and the houses she used to live at. She has never enjoyed staying at the houses so she decides to run away every time."
1,Eddie's Review,"The book Pictures of Hollis Woods showed me no experience at all. It is a very bad book. I never want to read it ever again. On chapter 1, the house was falling apart. On chapter 13, late that night the snow tapered off and stopped. These are the parts I did not like. I was disappointed in the whole book."
1,WORST BOOK EVER!!!,"DOSNT HAVE A PLOT, NO POINT, ALL ABOUT PICTURES!!! HELLO????? WHO WOULD WANT TO READ IT?HELLO???????????"
5,woooonderful!,"i really, really loved this book. hollis woods is a whole lotta trouble, as so many people have told her. it seems like no one wants to keep her in their life. or she just doesn't want to be in theirs. but anywho, this is written averagely, nothing spectactular. but it's good.read it, and then see what you think.it's good. so i recommend it."
4,great,This book is great. It is and orphan girl who has flashbacks that rremind her of her life. It is a good book to read if you like exciting books!!!
1,WHY did this book get an award???,"I will agree with some of the people that liked this book that it was written well. The WORDS were set up well. I cannot relate to this book at all, though. In the product decription it explained that the parts with Steven, Izzy, and the ""Old Man"" were ""memories"". I never figured that out. I went through the whole book thinking that they were at Hollis's summer home. I guess I was wrong. This book is WAY too confusing for me. Other people in my class have really enjoyed this book. My guess is that they catch on to things much quicker than me. In the book, they do not do a good job telling you who the charechters are, in my opinion. Anyways, I wouldn't read this book if I were you."
1,Did I Read the Same Book?,"After seeing these awesome reviews, I was really excited to read this book. Now I'm wondering if I've read the same one?I work with elementary students in reading groups and the writing style is too confusing for even above average readers. It was almost stream of consciousness at times, which can be really annoying.What could have been a fabulous book, based on the characters and situations, ending up being a jumbled mess."
4,"Review of ""Pictures of Hollis Woods""","This book is a pretty good book. The two main characters are Hollis Woods, a twelve-year-old foster girl who was abandoned at the age of one hour, and Josie, a retired art teacher. It begins with a description with a picture entitled ""X"" and there are descriptions of other pictures every one or two chapters. In the story Hollis runs away from Josie to her last family that almost adopted her. Then she realizes she needs Josie and Josie needs her.This book was pretty good, but had some rough spots, so I took one star away. I read this books first when I was ten, and it got me interested.The book is for ages 9-12."
3,Pictures of Hollis Woods,"There was one time whe a little girl named Hollis Woods, was found out in the middle of Hollis Woods.I like the book because it tells a life story.The part that I loved the most was when she finally found the place that she could call home.She was happy about finding a family but the thought of her having to go to every foster home in the world had to be very upsetting. I think a lot of people would enjoy this book."
3,Pictures of Hollis Woods,"I liked this story a lot. Its about a young girl about 13 or 14. She feels she has been in every foster home. When she finally found a place she really likes, she is being taken away by some people. The people figure Josie is old and has Alzheimers and can't remember hardly anything. Hollis decides she will ask Josie if she wants to run away. When they start off, Hollis realizes she is happy. Will she be found by the Mustard woman? The Mustard Woman is a woman who wanted to take Hollis away from Josie. I suggest you read the book."
5,Beautifully written tug at the heart,"Hollis Woods is a treasure, a schmaltzy tug at the heart. It is a short novella, a quick read that will leave you with a warm feeling. I'm guessing it was written for the YA audience, but I enjoyed it just the same. Great writing and great story telling."
5,Guaranteed to evoke emotions and thought,"This is a lovely story that is bound to draw out all sorts of feelings of compassion, frustration, and gratitude. I read it when I was looking for a gift for a pre-teen girl who is struggling to fit in and ended up buying a few copies to give to other girls. Many girls that age hold a lot in and I thought this book was a wonderful means to provoke thought and discussion. The main character (Hollis) is not perfect, which is a welcome change from so many books targeting pre-teens, and the reader may gain some confidence by recognizing some of Hollis's defects. It's hard to read without thinking of how you would handle various situations. A little introspection can go a long way at that age. I loved this book and highly recommend it."
4,Word Pictures,"In Pictures of Hollis Woods, Giff creates a wonderful photograph of the perfect family. Not a family without problems, but perfect for Hollis Woods, an orphan who can't seem to fit into one home.The story is told in retrospect, and the pictures that Hollis has drawn (she happens to be a wonderful artist who can draw, but can't relate to people nearly as well) are like a photo album of her perfect family. Hollis thumbs, figuratively, through the photo album as she is trying to live with yet another foster parent. As an artist herself, a new foster parent loves Hollis for who she is - an artist. Unfortunately, her new foster parent has problems too. She is old and forgets too many things. Will Hollis be placed with yet another family and never finish her perfect family photo album?"
4,My thoughts on this book.,I think that this book is pretty interesting. I enjoyed it. I do recommend this book. I hope you like this book as much as I did! Our school does English Festivle (where you read 6 books and take tests on them and go to a college for a day and do activites on them) and I heard so many people talking about this book. It's a favorite of the students! Good Luck! ENJOY!!
3,Whats all the fuss about?,"I read alot of young adult books. So when it was recommended to me by several people to read this AMAZING book called ""Pictures of Hollis Woods"" I was more than happy to find a copy. I was happy to see it was honored by the Newberry Awards, as that usually leads to an unusually good book. However, I felt that this story was rather lack luster. It was well written. The characters were cute. And the story was sweet. But thats all it was... cute and sweet. I was very dissapointed considering how much praise I had heard about this book, it didnt seem to deserve it.Dont skip it. Its a sweet book. But its not the amazing piece of literature that people are making it out to be. If you can get it on CD. The reader was excellent. If you read it, you will be entertained. If you dont, it wouldnt be a tragedy."
4,pictures of Hollis Woods,I thought Pictures of Hollis Woods was an excelent book! it told about a girl with many promblems and how running away did not solve anything. She learned that someone could reallt care about her. I think Every one should read this book!
3,Pictures of Hollis Woods,"This book was about a chid named Hollis Woods. She is a foster child, and she has a very hard time finding a home where shes comfrotables, not only that she hasnt found any families that she likes yet. She has a extremly hard time staying out of trouble. She tells her memories through photos, and she remembers certain things. My thoughts of the book was that I understand about her moving from home to home and not liking it, but personally, I didnt like the book as much as I thought that I would. It just wasnt my type. I like exciting and has alot of adventures. This book just wasnt me type."
5,Great book!,"My granddaughter fell in love with book at the library, and this was the only place I could find it. It is an exciting book about playing in the snow, perfect for 2 - 5 year olds."
5,A great treat for hardcore TMNT fans..,"Part 2 of Season 1 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a good watch for those who have enjoyed reading the mirage comics. Naturally, it's not a 100% accurate adaptation from the comics, since it's made for all ages, so you have to understand that if it was completely accurate, it would be too violent for the younger viewers. All in all, I really enjoyed the episodes very much and I am already anticipating for the Season 2 compilation, whenever that comes out..."
5,Awesome,"I never heard this--it was bought for my sister. But she went on and on of how she loves this CD. If you like the newer style of rock with a genuine spirit towards God within it, you may really like this one."
3,One for the archives,"A collection of demos produced by Kim Fowley; four of the songs were re-recorded under John Cale's supervision and appeared on the legendary 1st Modern Lovers LP; the others - with the exception of ""I Wanna Sleep In Your Arms"" - are included in the set for the ""Precise Modern Lovers Order"" live album. The sound quality is predictably poor, and the performances not considerably different from the other recorded versions. This item is basically for collector's only. Song list: (1) Roadrunner #1, (2) She Cracked, (3) Astral Plain, (4) Walk Up the Street, (5) I Wanna Sleep In Your Arms, (5) Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste, (6) Dance With Me, (7) Girlfren, and (8) Roadrunner #2."
3,Relics of a (mostly) forgotton era,"Jonathan Richman was more than just a fan of the Velvet Underground; he worshipped them, followed them and copied them, and it shows on this early album. The Underground weren't a particularly good band, but they were a very original band, and much the same can be said about Richman in this phase of his career.The musicians can barely play their instruments, the lyrics make Brian Wilson's sound sophisticated, and the songs all sort of sound the same, and yet there's that germ of raw energy that characterized the best of the garage bands, and that todays' formulaic punk bands have never been able to copy. Maybe the current crop of punks should give this disk a listen."
2,barely a singles band,"I bought this compilation because I love the Tubes 3 best known singles which are: Don't Want to Wait Anymore, She's a Beauty and Talk to Ya Later. All 3 are excellent classic 80's songs which I loved when they were played on the radio. Based on those songs, I thought that the rest of their material would run in the same vein but was terribly disappointed to find that the rest is experimental New Wavy drivel for the most part. Some of the other songs are listenable but none measure up to those 3 singles. I would recommend this cd only for people that are already familiar with the Tubes music. For all others, download the 3 songs and save yourself the trouble."
3,Not entirely pleased...,"It's a beautiful chess set, but unfortunately it was missing 6 pieces, which I can not get because I bought it in October as a Christmas present. And of course, a chess set without the right amount of pieces is basically useless. While I understand the selling not wanting me to return it due to the time that has passed since the purchase, it would have been nice if they'd have offered some assistance in trying to help me acquire the missing pieces.So, while it's a pretty set - if you want it for playability I don't recommend this set. If you want it as pure decoration, go right ahead."
3,Ok album,"The album is ok. It's definitely not ""The Score"". It's most of Wyclef yelling on the songs and making no sense. I guess it's a good effort to be different in hip hop at the time, but a definite classic is there 2nd album"
2,Blunted for sure,"The problem with this album mainly lies in its production, the beats are just too similar to offer the listener any diversity, It is a shame because the fugees are a solid group but unfortunatlly this does not become obvious until their second album the score. The only standout track is nappyheads remix but only because it is the only song with it's own identity; my advice go for their second lp the score instead"
2,Trash,This is garbage and they want to come back???? Look they can come back if they make stuf like what was on the score but not this. This Cd I wouldnt recommend it 4 nobody
3,"Good album, but not the best execution","Definitely worth while for Fugees fans.Not as enjoyable as The Score, even though the lyrics are probably just as good. My main criticism is that they don't make good use of Lauryn Hill's phenomenal singing voice with the exception of a couple of tracks. Look out for Some Seek Stardom, Hill sings an orginal rhyme to the tune of the saxophone solo in Moody's Mood For Love. A few tracks sample jazz, and the whole album is doing something a little different from straight up rap. A good effort."
4,All-around beautiful book for hardcore Kubrick fanatic,"I finally found this book in a local public library; a real treasure! Many b/w and color photos throughout, from FEAR AND DESIRE to THE SHINING, including some priceless, candid shots of the notoriously camera-shy director. Text is fairly comprehensive, though ultimately on the long-winded and dry side (you know French criticism). Well worth searching for!"
3,Get a smaller size than you think,"These are a reasonably good value, but they do seem big, especially when wet. I tried them on dry before my trip and they were ok, but got a little floppy when wet. The next size down would have been better. I did not have any problems with them coming off, just feeling loose."
4,Great product but sizing system has issues,"I bought these booties not reading about the sizing issues that other reviewers had mentioned (my bad) but found that a pair of dive socks or heavy wool socks make a size 13 regular fit my 13 extra wide foot very comfortably. I use them mostly for kayaking but also for snorkeling and diving in the cold Northern California ocean waters so the larger size has turned out to be a positive thing. Add a full sole arch support and they make a serviceable camp boot for foraging and portaging, a pair of over-sized Tivo sandals turn these into great expedition booties. Sturdy zipper and gusset with a snug upper to help control water movement and keep your feet warm."
2,Not good for wide feet; fins slip off.,"I bought these for use with Oceanic Viper open-heel fins. My shoe size is 11.5, and I prefer ""wide"" sizes when I can find them. Since other reviewers had indicated that these tend to run big, so I ordered a size 11. They seemed to fit OK out of the water, but when I wore them with the fins the front part of the boot scrunched up and made my toes uncomfortable. Also, the rubber sole on the back of the boot rounds over to the heel without any sort of lip or ridge to help retain the fin, and even with the fin straps tightened as tight as I could get them, the fins kept slipping off. I ended up returning these and replacing with Aqualung Echozip Ergo boots (size 12), which fit my feet almost perfectly and keep my fins on my feet."
4,Bueno pero no el mejor.,"Empieso diciendo q Rata Blanca si no s la mejor banda d Heavy Metal n Latinoamerica s una d las mejores. Pues hablemos del disco ""La llave de la puerta secreta"". No s lo mejor q e oido d Rata pero si mejor q algunos otros disco d ellos mismos. Las rolas q recomiendo n ste disco son ""La llave de la puerta secreta"", ""Bajo el poder del sol"", ""Guitarra Española"", ""Michell, odia la oscuridad"". Si son fans d Rata s daran cuenta q algunas canciones suena algo parecidas a su ultimo disco. Para personas q empiezan a conocer a Rata les remcomiendo el disco d ""Grandes canciones"" una muy buena coleccion d rolas d Rata. Para finalizar digo q ste disco no s el mejor pero si un muy buen disco con buen arsenal d rolas q dejaran a los fans no solo d Rata contentos pero tambien a los fans del Heavy Metal n español."
4,DESTILANDO ENERGIA,"EN ESTA ENTREGA RATA BLANCA COLOCA LA ENERGIA DE SIEMPRE, AUNQUE NO OFRECEN GRANDES INNOVACIONES EN SU ESQUEMA MUSICAL, NO DEJA DE ACENTUAR SUS DESARROLLOS ARMÓNICOS DE LA MANO DEL VIRTUOSISMO ENCANTADOR DE LA GUITARRA DE WALTER GIARDINO."
2,Disappointing,"Rata Blanca used to be power metal and you will be disappointed if you expect power metal from this album. I would even not tag this as heavy metal. Guitars have very weak distorsions and many times there is no audible guitar. The beat of some songs is good, and this makes this album deserve at least 2 stars, otherwise I would give it one. If you are looking for power metal, look elsewhere."
3,"Interesting, but a bit misleading.","Based on the title, I was truly expecting to read the ""wisdom of the ages."" Unfortunately, other than a few snippets and a couple of generalizations, the majority of this book is centered on the frustrations of obtaining the knowledge being sought and the process by which the author was able to acquire some patience with the elderly. To the author's credit, she mentions that this is how the book will transpire early on. To the author's discredit, she never changed the title appropriately. Kudos to the power of marketing and a lesson for those considering this title, ""Read the reviews."""
1,Disappointing,"The subtitle of the book is quite deceptive. I forced myself to finish this book b/c I was halfway through it when I realized that there are no lessons from centurians. The book mostly consists of her battling with her own interviewing habits and really offers nothing in the way of lessons told by the interviewees. As the other reviewer mentioned, it has no substance. Quite a disappointment for such a good idea!"
2,Maddeningly uneven book.,"When I started reading this book I hoped it would be about centenarians and offer clues into their miraculous longevity, but instead the author's digressions are frustrating. Half way through the book and we realized much of the book is about the author, her marriage, and even a visit to her psychotherapist (!).0 Many paragraphs are like reading an on-the-road travelogue as the author describes scenery and environs to and from her interviews.Do we care? How is it relevenat to the secrets of centenarians?Important questions are virtually ignored: what's their spirituality/relligious beliefs? diet? excercise? etc. Instead the author asks innane and irrelevant questions such as ""What was the dust bowl like?"" as if there are not already written accounts found in any library? Maybe the author doesn't mind wasting time figuring she too will to 100, but I sure can't say that about myself. I don't like my time wasted."
3,Not much substance for such a great topic,"Like some of the other reviewers, I also expected more from this book, not so much ""the meaning of life,"" but some wise lessons about how to stay positive, how to overcome the hardships of life and how to focus on what's important in life. I also expected more anecdotal passages about life a century ago. Instead, the book is thin on wisdom, thin on historical information and much more about the author's interviewing difficulties and personal angst over her own decisions (esp regarding children.) Moreover, I kept asking myself, If you keep finding out that these interviews should be done in many hours over several days to get really good material, why do you keep coming up short on time and information? It doesn't say much for someone whose job involves interviewing that she can't seem to get this into her head. The book is worth reading - it's an easy read - as long as you don't expect too much from it."
3,If I Live To Be 100: Lessons from the Centenarians,"If you read this book, you won't want to live to be a hundred. It's useful from that standpoint. One reorganizes one's thoughts on longevity. The pages on limbic resonance are quite interesting. My guess is that the radio show was better. In the book, the author is more intrusive than needed."
4,Simon and the Witch,"The book I read is called Simon and the Witch. There are six chapters. They are called, Chapter one, The Backwards Spell. Chapter two, The lost magic wand. Chapter three, The Witch at the seaside. Chapter four, Witch has measles, Chapter five, Halloween, Chapter six, The Witch's visitor. I like chapter Three the best. The book is about a boy called Simon, and the Witch. I read it in one day. I like that book because it was great. I liked it because it was exciting."
5,Great Gedge!,"Sequel to Gedge's House of Dreams provides closure for most of heroine Thu's issues left over from that book: her son, her pharaoh, her passion, her craft, and her own survival. High levels of poetic prose provide pleasure to literary readers and general alike. Historical base seems accurate, and cultural details were as amazing as in House of Dreams. A real treat with a believable Egyptian woman of the time period who acts always to win and to survive among the powers that surround her."
4,Baseball's Biggest Blunder,"Author Brent Kelley has explored a topic not reportdon extensively but nevertheless an essential part of the fabric of major league baseball in the 1950's. By and large, players signed to bonuses in excess of, get this, $4000 were not allowed to properly develop as they were bound to the signing major league club for two years. Some were shunned by their teammates, as they were taking up a roster spot. Others, after their two years, went to the minors, acquired the necessary tools, and flourished as major leaguers. And one was a star from day one.Kelley has interviewed many of the players and their insight is valuable to any student of the game."
3,The rule that hurt my brothers chances in the big leagues,"I have yet to read the book about the blunder that helped to thawart my older brothers career. Salvador Herrera was 18 years old and was sent to the Milwaukee Braves. Yes, he should have been groomed in the minor leagues and brought up slowly. But, the bonus rule was in effect and had to sit the bench with the big club and that was the worst thing for Salvador. He was paid a small sum by todays standards, but he said, "" is all I did was pick up splinters with the big club."" He did trade off with Bruton and with Aaron, but he was eager to play the full nine innings. The rule did him in and was the worst thing for baseball. I will purchase the book and get the details and talk to my brother. Signed, Manuel A. Herrera"
1,Complete ...,"Theory wise, the book exposes things relatively well. However, I cannot get over how thoroughly maddening it is to be second-guessing the answers in the back of the book when you're trying to learn by doing. For ...sake, it's the 3rd edition and it's still full of errors! Inexcusable! There's no way to build confidence in problem solving when many of the solutions to the odd numbered problems are wrong! No matter how clear the theory, it's still a work in progress, incomplete at best. It is, quite frankly, shameful to be passing this book off as some sort of learning tool."
2,Littered with errors,"The author states that electromagnetic theory is one of the most diffucult couses in your curriculm, but he sure doesn't make it easy on you.The text is laced with errors, from the text itself, to missing symbols, to errors in the solutions at the end of the book.It is extremely frustrating to work on problems only to find that the error given in the Appendix is wrong.It is a shame that in its 3rd edition (as well as the revised 3rd edition) that errors are still present in the text"
2,Typos ruin this book.,"This can be a much better book if the editors spend some time to proof-read it. I like the way the author present the materials. The examples are good and the explanations are clear. But THERE ARE SO MANY ERRORS which I believe will confuse many students. Most errors are trivial- wrong sign, wrong font, or wrong symbols. Unless the teacher can help the students to correct the errors, I cannot recommend this book as the text book for EM theory."
2,not a good source of understanding,"treat it like a second rate reference manual, not a proper textbook. For some good understanding of electromagnetisim and Maxwell's equations look into the Feynman Lectures on physics, the second volume."
2,Not the best book..,"A lot of examples in the book are absolutely wrong. Its more of a reference book than a text book. There are better books than this one if you really want to learn the material. The one book i would recommend is ""Fundamentals of electromagnetics"" by Fawaz Ulaby."
4,easy listening,"The composer Castelnuovo-Tedesco is primarily known for his guitar music and film scores (Hollywood). On this CD we hear his most popular work--the first guitar concerto, with its beautiful second movement. The other concerto movements on this CD are all pleasant, and sometimes dramatic, but are more like film scores than pieces of Classical music. The reader need not be worried that the music of this 20th century composer is overly dissonant, for, in fact, it is very 19th-Century in style. I enjoy this music for its relaxing and unobtrusive qualities."
4,Amazing Ukulele Player,I am impressed by the ability shown with the songs in this CD. It is definitely a grear addition to yout Uke Music Library.
4,A nice way to invest time.,First time for me to assemble such a toy. So far made first squad only. But I'm planning to spend a week to work on my army of Necrons.And it's kinda meditating kind of time spending.Overall I like it and happy with my money spent.
4,Old School,"This book has a lot of templates, drawn out step by step. It has tons of info on carving. Its a Japanese book totally in English. Its a classic."
5,Excellent Book for the first time ice carver,"I purchased this book back in 1984 and have utilized most of the templates. This is a great starter book on ice carving. At one time this was the Bible for ice carving and the information given is still quite useful. Only 10,000 books were produced. All serious ice carvers should have a copy in their collection."
4,It works,"If you have a model 1991, with a larger gas tank, then you may want to adjust length of hose. Just don't cut too much away, measure twice, cut once."
5,Lifesavers - Wildberry,I could not find these in the stores anywhere. Me & my kids love this flavor. Thanks :-)
3,riffs beginning to end,"...From there, the trío does its way, and while the things sound magnificent through and through, songwise not there is a great deal of variety &#65533; true of a lot of bands, maybe, but in the end the majority of the dudes would want some type of interruption. As result, when Fudge Tunnel treats somewhat different, you exceed him &#65533; the key song is ""Does not Have Time for You."" The touch is smooth in the center of the album, which does immediately strike in skulls, still with the aim to finalize fried. The jazzy drumming in ""Ten percent"" and the silly alt-rock foci of ""Puts"" mouth down gives other insinuations of testing. These guys get no loving in the wife, that for certain.There is a definite sense of the humor in the play in every song, though. 3 stars."
4,High Adventure on the High Seas...,"After enjoying ""The Wrecker"" by Justin Scott, I checked to see what else he had written. ""The Shipkiller"" is a 30 year earlier work and held special interest to me as a sailor. The book is long out of print, but I was able to obtain a used hardbound copy in decent condition at Amazon.The nautical action sequences are first rate, but the premise is a bit of a stretch for me at times. Peter Hardin is hellbent on revenge to the point of being crazy and yet manages to get several near strangers (e.g. Ajaratu Akanke, Culling, Miles Donner) to support his cause. And the incident in the Indian Ocean doldrums was very cliché. Anyway, it's fiction, so I accepted these shortcomings so as not to get in the way of enjoying an otherwise good book."
5,"One Of My Favorites, Ever.","I first read this book at about the time it was released. I have read it at least once every couple of years and always find something I missed or understand more clearly. I have destroyed, through reading , two paperback editions and have a First Edition Hardcover that I rarely touch. I would recommend this to anyone, sailor or not. Great story of man versus machine. I am not a sailor, power boat guy, and I can only imagine the hardships that Dr. Hardin endured. I would be honored to meet him. As previously mentioned there is a sequel Called Fire and Ice written under a different name, good story but not as good, to many holes and not nearly as probable. As to a movie, I was looking forward to it until I saw the mess that Hollywood made of ""Raise the Titanic"". I'll stick with the book. Would love to see this available on Kindle. ENJOY."
5,one of the best,"yuri bashmet plays schnittke in such a gorgeous way, so you can feel the composer deeply!!!!! highly recommend"
4,Almost brilliant...,"Thicker than the bible and more entertaining. The story about Picard is the best by far, but the rest are not too bad except for the Peter David story. Captain Calhoun is the most boring character in the Trek universe ever... Even the characters in the Trek cartoon from the early 70's were more complex then him. But the Picard story more then compensate the Calhoun story. I do strongly recommend the book for all Trekkies and Trekkers."
4,The Vocabulistic Cali Agent,"This EP is seriously dope. Being that Asia is in my opinion the best emcee, i obviously love this CD. He flips words unlike any other with an indescribable flow. The production is also pretty good; mellow and head nodding beats. The only thing that's bad about this record is the length; only 7 tracks. If you appreciate real hip hop though, this is a must-buy"
3,Wack overall,"The first song was cool ya know and then....it got worse. I thought the best beat was the first one and unfortunately you've gotta hear it again. His rhymes are tight, but the production crew leaves much to be desired. He should've stuck with Peanut Butter."
4,European Democracies,"This was a required textbook and I have found it to be informative for my class, but also very interesting."
4,Excellent insight into seamy side of early Anchorage,"This is a very interesting book for anyone who has wondered what life was like in Anchorage prior to the oil boom. It the story of a small time punk who proceeds to get involved in a variety of cheap stunts that all revolve around either gambling, prostitution or racketeering. While it sounds depressing, actually it is a glimpse into the highly spirited society (admittedly the underbelly) that made Alaska such an exciting place to live. For anyone who thinks Alaska is all about gortex or salmon, this is a must read."
5,The most widely cited book in the literature on MT,"This is the most widely cited book in the machine translation literature. It's an excellent introduction, and well worth reading. No algorithms, but a great overview of the issues and problems in MT."
3,Good info on GENETIC testing,"If I were only interested in genetic testing and genetic defects, I would have given this book at least a four star. (Would have been a five if it had a better index!)But I wanted information on birth defects, open and closed cord defects also. I thought this book was a little weak in that area. As an example, the book didn't contain any statistics about the nuchal fold translucency ultrasound and results, etc.It's not FUN reading about negative aspects of pregnancy like this, but the authors did a good job in making it readable and informative."
1,Who could possibly enjoy this?,"I really don't understand how the people who made this ""hip hopumenatry"" plan to make their money back, unless they plan all the people who went to Freaknik 2000 to buy a copy to see if they're in it. This movie is basically a video documentary of Freaknik, Black College Spring Break in Atlanta. I don't know if I can really call it a documentary because it doesn't really follow any really flow of ideas. The main idea of this movie is booty. That gets old real fast. It is amazing though to watch people let total strangers just lift up their skirts and smack their booties. Makes no sense to me, maybe you just have to be there. Anyway, pass on this one and just check out some No Limit videos and you'll fill the same booty quota."
5,"An Excellent Read -- Oh, and a Great Cookbook!","I am a great fan of Uncle Billy's DownEast Barbeque. I live in Maine and visit Uncle Billy's restaurant whenever I can. But, since I live 5 hours away at the other end of the state, I find the recipes in this book a great way to indulge my BBQ cravings. The recipes are easy to follow, and simple to make. Some recipes have many ingredients, but I find all of them necessary to the final dish. A great cookbook!"
2,For Use by Fluent Greek speaker to teach Greek ONLY,"We live in Greece and my dh is a homeschooled freshman. She did not want to take any other foreign language for HS credit, but we could not justify the many available tourist books, for high school credit.I was looking for a text and workbook that would be challenging enough for a high school curriculum. This book said directions were in English so I thought I had found what I needed. Only SOME of the directions are in English and only SOME of the words are translated. Much of the book is assumed to be read out loud by a Greek speaking Teacher to a class. Since I can't understand what I am reading to her we are like the blind leading the blind. We are struggling through but I definitely wouldn't recommend the book for home use.ALSO, we take the workbook to our neighbors to grade and our natural born Greek neighbor says there are MANY errors in the book."
3,Good source but not for self study,"This book is an excellent source of explanations and grammar but definitely no for self study. There is NO answer key. Too much role play and classroom type exercises for someone studying by him/herself. A lot of the exercises are the drill type (I see this is still a hangover from the obsolete 1950's academic type grammars concepts) instead o meaningful interaction which makes you creat sentences. Only 1 CD for a big 608 page book, much too little. 2500 words are alot for someone wanting a basic course for self study. Don't waste your money on the workbook which is more of the same drills and exercises like ""write the English word next to Greek one"". All I need is a piece of paper for an exercise like that. Vocabulary is learned by ""meaningful interaction"" in context, not lists. It could be a good complement to a ""learn yourself"" course, however."
3,Greek Today for alone learning,"May be a good book but it havn't a dictionaty for lessons or a translation of the text and this make difficult to learn alone. You need a teacher for learning. Also , evry lesson is divide in few sections and that dos'n aid to get all picture.I find a teacher to help me but this get more mony."
2,Not Anti anything,"This wedding planner book is just like any other. It's not anti anything. I found a better book with more space and easier organization. If your looking for the anti traditional wedding planning, your best bet is to just look on the internet for ideas instead of in this book."
2,Passed it on to another.,"I bought this planner when I first got engaged. I thought it was something neat, and maybe out of the ordinary. I was slightly disappointed in the fact it really doesn't give you an idea of what you're getting into. As for planning, it has some cute ideas, but when it comes down to it, it just doesn't cut it. It's definitely worth reading, but as for a planner, definitely a not the best. I gave mine to a friend who found the same who gave it to another and so on. We all agree, Good read, not a good planner."
3,Decent book- not what I would expect from the title,"I recieved this book as a present from my MOH. The title is a little misleading. This book is more for women who want to be brides- just not the normal cookie cutter bride- not for women who do not want to be brides at all.My MOH thought I would like it because my fiance is the one who wants the wedding and I do not. I have found some good tips in hte book, but it caters to woman who want a wedding."
3,so so,i thought there would be more to this book but it was pretty plain. there are a few checklists but i wasnt overly impressed by it
2,A dissapointment,"I was hoping for something unique, but it's just like all the other pro-bride, pro-industry, pro-spend-a-LOT-of-money-on-a-wedding planners (but in a ""non-traditional"" pink disguise). The mere fact that it has diamond rings circling the page numbers should have been my first clue. If you are really looking for some unique and inspirational ideas, you will not find them here. That said, it is still a pretty decent planner, has a few (FEW) unique tips, and pockets and space for contact info, etc. Look it over in a bookstore if possible before you buy."
2,"Loved it, until it stopped working","I loved this microwave. It had a lot of great features (popcorn, sensor cooking, defrost, etc.), and they worked well. Unfortunately, the microwave just stopped working about a year after we purchased it. The lights on the front panel just never came on again, and we couldn't use it. I would have expected more life from the product."
3,Worked Great for a while,"This microwave is very large and cooks quickly. It worked great for a while.Then the door started not closing completely and sparks arched while cooking and started burning the plastic around the door.Now, when I open the door, the turntable starts turning on its own. I am afraid to put my hand inside with the turntable moving in case it is still cooking with the door open. Probably a switch is defective and it is not teling the microwave to shut off with the door open.I could pay to get it fixed, but as cheap as microwaves are, I will just buy another one, probably a different brand."
5,This thing is huge!,"My wife and I are both incredibly happy with this microwave. When I ordered it I didnt realize how big 2.2 Cu. Ft is. I think I could cook a whole turkey in this thing. The controls are intuitive and simple to use. Overall, I am glad that we deiceded to buy this one."
4,Only for the PS2 Fat!,If you've got the older style PlayStation 2 this is a great carrying case and storage option (especially if you've stepped up to the PS2 slim or a next-gen console).If you are looking for a carrying case for the slim PS2 though stay away. The straps are not made to hold the thinner model console and you will not be able to secure it!
1,Not as advertised,"""I guess this comment would be for both Amazon and Beach Audio. All the descriptions and reviews and sku numbers indicate that this item would be the old style PS2 (large case). What I received was the GPak for the PS2 slim. Needless to say, this WILL NOT fit my old PS2. Since every reseller seems to have a restocking fee, even for perfectly good items that I won't open, I guess I'm stuck. This is the second time in the last 6 months that this has happened with Amazon. If they are going to facilitate product distribution with other resellers, they need to at least sell what was advertised. This borders on bait and switch! I don't think I'll be coming back to Amazon. Buyer beware, you do so at your own risk with Amazon!"
3,"""OLD"" ps2 g-pak","I was alittle disappointed with this product. It is made for the original PS2, the larger one. My boys have the smaller, slimmer model and the velcro straps just don't hold it very well. It slides inside the case. I rated this ""case"" (not game) 3 stars because it is not made for the slimmer PS2. If you have the older PS2, I'm sure you will be much happier with it."
1,keep away from this book,"This book was recommended for my course. It is very poor indeed. The first few chapters which cover the basics aren't too bad, but things very quickly become awfull. Unnecessary complications are introduced into simple programs, and not explained at all well. The author plunges into each chapter without introducing any basic concepts. In the graphics chapter, nothing is said about setting up a graphics object - the second page is already talking about methods in the package. Not only has this book not helped me one bit in learning Java, it has actually hindered it. You have been warned."
4,Still going strong,"You have to admit that the song is a classic, whether you hate it or love it. The club mix adds nothing new except to extend the original a couple of minutes. The northern light remix is neither here nor there for me. While the sequential one remix is good, the signum remix builds a great progression that will raise the hair on your neck."
5,A RELAXING DANCE MUSIC,"First time I heard this dance music at a club, damnn, i said to myself, ""I gotta get this one"". It is more relaxing, soft, smooth trance music. ""Dont Stop"" and this one have bit similarities, and it's cooler than ever. So, if you like a relaxing trance music, I recommend you to get this because once you hear it, you will listen to it over and over."
5,Excellent Club Song.,Best song for groovers. It would be wonderful if you listen to Dj Jurgen's Better Off Alone after this song.
5,This is such a wicked song!!!!,I think that this is the best song ever made and they should give it an award or something like that.
5,Dare I call it the best CD ever?,"This CD is just awesome . . . when I was in Spain it was practically an anthem, DJs would play these long, extended versions of Til I Come and people used to just go crazy . . . you'll start dancing and not want to stop, and you'll walk around singing in everywhere you go . . ."
5,"This will be the tune for the summer, a must buy for every1","I loved this tune the first time I heard it. It instantly stays in your head. It took me ages to get it, as it doesn't come out till June 20th. I found it on a cd and after so many times listening to it, I haven't got sick of it. Buy it definitely if you get the chance."
5,First-rate exposition,"This is an excellent book and should be read by non-theologians and theology students alike. Many of the principles he teaches with regard to the proper handling of Koiné Greek are very general linguistic ideas and would hold true for students of nearly any other language. Above that, it is also a good primer on logical and argumentation fallacies as well. He is a first-rate scholar and, whether you agree with (or even care about) his theology, you will find a lot of useful information, explained very well, in a fairly compact book."
3,Challenging,"This is a challenging work. It has encouraged me to be sharper in my approach to God's Word. The author is careful to relate some of his own conclusions which he has upon further examination determined to be fallacious. Such introspection is refreshing.Apparently he is still unaware of a few of his fallacies, however. For instance, he defends the NIV translation of John 3:16 ""one and only Son"" as apposed to the KJV ""only begotten Son"" based upon analysis of the Greek word monogenis. What he fails to realize is that God does NOT have only one Son. This is an incontrovertible Bible fact; to say otherwise is to violate a plethora of Scripture texts. God has many adopted sons but He has only one Begotten Son. When taken in light of Scripture, ""only begotten"" is the only possible translation.This is a profitable book. But read with a wary eye; Carson is not infallible either."
3,Exegetical Fallicies.,"I have no doubt that Dr. Carson thoroughly knows what he is talking about, in fact, I saw him in Boston recently, however the book is not what I expected, and thus even though I'm reading it, it is not holding my interest. I'm hoping that by the time I finish it, that I will have gleaned some good information though."
4,Boring but needed information - A Biblical Studies Must (you may need to know Greek to get the most out of it),"This book will have your head spinning with thoughts about the many sermons and personal lines of thinking that the author demonstrates as just plain fallacious. A hard read to get through, with a general knowledge of Koine Greek necessary for some of the thicker parts, this book is worth the hard work. A great reference for any Pastor, scholar, or devoted layman."
1,A disappointment,"A main focus (although not the only focus) of topic examples used in this book is to try to prove man's authority over the woman in Christianity. The author attempts to but fails to disprove valid arguments offered by other respected Christian authors that disagree with this author's view concerning the respective bible passages. It is at this juncture that the book content becomes long winded, in which many of the fallacies the author has directed at other Christian authors, D. A. Carson becomes guilty of the same."
4,"Loose, Wonderful Figure Painting!","The photorealistic figure painting in most books is intimidating and, to many, unappealing. Mel Stabin liberates us from this tight, souless style. His people are fresh and fast, and something of their essence of the person is captured.Stabin's instruction, which could be more plentiful, is full of useful information. Copying his paintings is very instructive. As is his former book Watercolor: Simple, Fast and Focused, this book is a gift to watercolorists and those who love looking at spontaneous, fresh paintings.Two other painter-authors who use this loose style for figures are Charles Reid and, for the nude figure, Douglas Lew (Painting from Life)."
3,A GOOD BOOK RUINED BY SPLITTING PAINTINGS,"I rate this a good to very good book on loose watercolor figure painting. Stabins flowing line brush drawings of the female figure are outstanding.THE REASON FOR ONLY 3 STARS,THERE ABOUT 10 OF THE BEST PAINTINGS COMPLETELY RUINED BY BEING ON TWO PAGES. ONE COMPLETE PAGE AND ABOUT 1/3 ON THE ADJACENT PAGE. PROBABLY THE BEST IS OF A DANCER SITTING ON THE FLOOR, AND HER FACE AND SHOULDERS ARE BURIED IN PAGE TO SPINE CURVE. I HAVE THE BOOK AND ONLY WAY I CAN SEE FULL PAINTING IS DISSEMBLE THE BOOK. WATSON/GUPTILL, ARE YOU LISTENING?"
3,Not the best book for a beginner,I would think this would be a wonderful book for someone who has a few years of watercolor experience but is trying to paint looser. For me it was just too difficult. I didn't think it gave much in the way of instruction but more samples of the artist's very loose and free flowing style. For me just looking at an artist's work doesn't help me to know how to do it.
3,Light on instruction,"The book is well illustrated and Mr. Stabin shares quite a bit of information, although it is not as in-depth instruction as a Reid book. Stabin uses an 11 value scale, in contrast to Reid's 6-7. I purchased this as it as the style of painting appeals to me. Illustrations are colorful and fresh."
5,Excellnt book!,I'm quite picky when purchasing books and normally I delegate this task to my daughter.She knows the kind of books I like.This was one of her picks and she didn't made a wrong decision.Excellent book.
5,Human figure painting,This is a wonderful book with lovely paintings in it and clear prose to help one improve and try new techniques.
5,One of the best CD's I have ever purchased!,The first time I listened to G Love I wasn't sure whether I liked the band or not. After 5 years since buying my first G Love CD I have found it second to none.
5,The whole cd is great!,I've had this cd for a while now and still never get sick of hearing it. Cold Beverage and Baby's Got Sauce are staples but the rest of the songs are very good as well. It's a must have.
5,SUPERB,"G LOVES NEW CD IS EXTREMELY SUPERB. THE MAN AND THE BAND CAN NICELY BLEND URBAN HIP HOP WITH SOUTHERN SOULFUL BLUES MUSIC. HE MAKES ME PROUD BE A PENNSLYVANIAN. CHECK OUT THE BAND IN CONCERT, HE PERSONALIZES THE SHOW TO EACH STATE, CITY"
5,"Great music, fun to listen to, from the beginning to end",I saw G. Love open for another band and fell hard. This album is one of those gems that has one great track after another.
4,Great Album,Unique funky blues recorded in a garage. I had this album years ago and lost it when a friend moved. So glad to finally have it again.
5,One of my ALL TIME FAV'S,"Since hearing G Love's ""Baby's Got Sauce"" song in a friend's car, I have been forever hooked on G Love's witty lyrics and funky blues mix. What's best about his music is that it's always fresh and keeps you groovin wherever and whatever you're doin. It's one of the few albums that I can put in my cd player and listen to several times over because I seriously ""just can't get enough"". It's that good. Hearing this band in concert is even more amazing. Whatever you do, be sure to at least get this album of G Lovin for your cd collection to truly kick it in style. ;)"
5,GLaSS: the best band in the world,"The best band in the world. The lyrics touch on everything in this world, from social problems to summer love, and everything inbetween. but all with a truth and liveliness you rarely see. their concerts are the best i've ever been to! as someone already said, if i could only have one cd to listen to, it would be g.love and special sauce, any one of them! i dont know what crappy music i was listening to before GLaSS, but no band/musician will ever beat GLaSS!"
4,Looks wonderful,It is a very nice looking watch. I received it very quickly and it is wrapped and sitting under the tree for my husband. I was really impressed with it. It is so much nicer in person.12/26 My husband really loves he.
3,Great.,For the price i couldnt beat this buy. This was something that my dad has wanted for a long time and he was certainly pleased!
4,Gift for Dad,Very nice looking watch offered at a great price. Since it was purchased as a gift I can not directly speak to how it feels to wear it but it is now the only watch my Dad wears so he must like it.
5,great watch,Great quality at a bargain price. Watch is not heavy and not to thick. It has that casual design and yet looks professional. Bought this as a gift. Looks great and sharp. Went to different department stores and cant find it better deal than this. Dont waste your time if you need to buy somebody a watch. Get it while you can...
3,good watch but,"I had a hard time adjusting the date. During my first several try, the watch stucked once but it went well later. However, I am still not sure whether I need to adjust date every month or other month since it looks there are 31 days every month."
5,Great Watch,I bought this watch for my Dad! It looks very nice and he likes it a lot! Anyway the bracelet is not crash resistant at all and he has to take care about not to put his hand on anyplace!
1,seiko men's watch # SGF719,I was very disappointed with the quality of this watch..i even doubt whether its a genuine seiko watch.Its so light like its made from cheap material from the street..iam in the process of sending it back..the watch is not just real
4,good quality for the price,"bought it long time ago. Works well till now.It is simple, but very useful. When I look at it at night, it is very easy to see the marks. Like it."
4,Great item for your wrist!,"As was expected, great watch for very reasonable watch. My son is totally satisfied with his gift."
4,Great watch overall except..,"Great watch, quality is high, looks nice, slim watch, overall excellent. I saw an old man wearing it and I told him nice watch and pointed out I had the same watch, he said I've had it for 11 years without any problems its a good watch, I asked how many times have you replaced the battery and he said only one time he thinks, so overall its a sturdy watch. The main reason I took one star off is because you can actually hear it click if you're in a quiet room and the face dial looks a bit plain for my taste, but it does have that elegant/classic look."
5,seiko watch,The new watch is bigger &heavier than the old seiko but is similar otherwise.I had my old seiko for over 25 yrs. and it worked perfectly untill it was lost so thats why I bought a new seiko to replace it.
5,Great watch for the money,"I bought this watch last month and am very happy with it. The watch looks really nice. The black face with the silver hands and hour markers looks great and you will never have to worry about this watch going out of style. It was very easy to adjust the band on this watch. I had never adjusted a band before and was able to do it in only a half hour or so using a safety pin. I am impressed with everything about this watch. The clasp seems to be very solid and it has never opened unless i was trying to open it. I went to Macys and they were selling this same watch for $135, so amazon is a great deal. The only thing that I wasnt very impressed with is the lumibright glow in the dark markers on the watch. They are very small and the watch doesnt glow very bright."
4,Seiko watch,My husband liked this watch. It came fast and on time. It was a great gift at a great price.
4,Seiko watch,"I bought this as a christmas present for my boyfriend since he mentioned he needed a watch a few months back. It came just in time, thank god. He was so surprised, he loves it. Its looks pretty snazzy and comes in handy so it really makes a good gift."
3,Nice watch--band...not so good!,"Just got the watch today. The timepiece seems great, I like the style of the band. But, could the band possibly have been any SMALLER? I'm a big guy with large hands, and not-huge wrists. I could barely get the watch on over my hand. Had I attempted to actually wear it, I would have lost the hand in half an hour! It was THAT tight, on its LARGEST setting.So, now I have my brand-new watch at a repair shop, where they hope to be able to find a couple of matching links to add to the band. I'll be without the watch for two weeks, and will spend nearly half what I spent on the watch to be able to actually wear it! Kinda disappointing, Seiko!"
2,Nice while it lasted,"I wore this watch for about 18 months before a piece of the watch snapped off and it no longer could be worn. Its a decent watch, but its of inferior quality compared to other watches in the 60-90 dollar price range. Be wary of the durability of this watch as it is just not made well enough to last more than 18-24 months."
1,avoid this watch,"be careful, it got scratched easily and the battery would be dead the first week you got it if you are unluckyand the customer service are not very helpful either.if it works fine, no problem. if not, it would be a pain to deal with the customer service, as all the online retailers."
1,"Great music, but useless to me because I couldn't listen to it in Windows Music Player","I guess I'm on the leading edge or something, but I have all my music ripped to MP3s which I listen to with Windows Music Player. I travel a lot for work and this is better than bringing CDs around with me. I could not rip this CD to MP3s (there was no mention on the CD of this fact). I also could not play it using the Windows Media Player, despite what they say on the box. I'm also pretty sure this means I can't listen to this music on my phone (Nokia 6630 which plays MP3s).This would be worth buying just for ""God is a DJ"" and ""Bring my family back"", if only I could actually listen to them! I'm returning this."
1,A big disappointment.,"Like many people, I have a lot of anxieties about public speaking and I know that I will not meet my professional goals until I get a handle on this problem. It is for this reason that I am very hungry for help with this issue. I really looked forward to getting some answers from the ""The Francis Effect"", but came away from it very disappointed.The first 68 pages of the book go into copious detail (some would say excessive detail) as to why we do not like to make speeches and being in the spotlight; however, the author does not provide enough instruction and explanation on how to overcome the anxiety producing symptoms of being in the spotlight. The rest of the book goes on to explain how to prepare and deliver a speech, but really gives only short shrift on how to deal with the panic attack symptoms that many of us deal with prior to delivering a speech. A more comprehensive book for anyone wanting help with this issue is ""In the Spotlight"" by Janet Esposito."
3,Objectivity anyone?,"Blue-collar Tears For Fears singer/songwriter fighting encroaching irrelevance with over-felt delivery does get a certain mileage out of its embracing bookends, though certainly is not as spectacularly solid as the user reviews suggest."
2,Not a good value for the price,Not sturdy and not a good value for the price. Our kids love playing basketball but this set would not stand up to the balls hitting the walls and parts inside. Do not recommend.
2,Spider Man Basketball Game,"When my grandson first received the game he loved it! Then he and his family had to re-locate which meant taking down the game. When they got to their new home, the game doesn't stay up like it did."
1,doesn't fit file tabs when closed,"Went together easily and seemed generally sufficient for the price - but when we put files in and tried to close it, it didn't fit with the file tabs. It crushed them down flat, or tried to but the top wasn't heavy enough so it basically didn't close. Would be perfect if they gave it another inch on top - but as is it is not good for filing."
1,Didn't meet expectations,"The picture is deceiving. Came flattened (not what I expected). Was smaller than my expectations, not sturdy at all and broken."
2,No BOTTOM,"Kind of disappointed...There is no BOTTOM to my box. Yes, it has a lid... but there is no bottom to the box.Functionally, I don't intent this to be a problem since the hanging folders should not fall.Nonetheless, aesthetically its ugly, unattractive, and just weird.The process of returning it seems exhausting and I will probably just keep it.If I had to do it over though, I would not buy it... I don't care how 'cute' it is."
2,Not to be used often,These file baskets look good but are not made very well. The seagrass weave was already coming loose when I received it. If you want something to put some files in to hide them these baskets are ok. But if you want something sturdy to use often this are not the one you want.
1,Hunk of Junk,"I am so disappointed. The box went together but my wires to hang my folders are too long. There are no instructions, although it should not be rocket science to put it together. The picture is misleading. It looks much bigger than it is. I suppose I can use it in the bathrrom to hold toilet paper or something. I won't purchase another one for sure."
1,Not good,This book was a real disappointment. Poorly written with bad examples. It actually convinced me NOT to use EZ as my CMS. I went with the ExpressionEngine CMS (EE) instead and I'm very happy I did. Much easier to learn and there's good books for it as well.
4,Excellent,"Excellent, thought-provoking piece of journalistic literature. Very fascinating, full of information and analysis and covers a large topic that hasn't been covered like this before. Definitely worth reading."
3,Worse appearance than the picture,"This watch looks fascinating on the picture. However, it is not that good.The so-called golden color is not even yellow, but dark. In addition, the diamond can't be seen with naked eyes. They are just a part of the metal texture. Also, the dial is not smooth. The unevenness can be found easily under light."
5,Nice watch,This watch is very rich looking. The price was phenomenal! I saw this for sale at other retailers for $300.00 plus! I have received numerous compliments.
4,Seiko Women's watch,"The picture doesn't do this watch justice, instead of the gaudy gold colour displayed, it is a very understated gold colour which makes the watch much more classy than pictured. It's a beautiful piece of jewelery, highly recommended and excellent service from the seller."
2,stop working after 1 yr and 3 month,"Looks nice, wife had it for a yr and got battery changed and 3 month later it kept stoping. Thought maybe bad battery, got it changed again and it stoped 1 month later. Send it in for repair or adjustment and they said it was not under warranty even though it says 3yr warranty. The movement needed to be repaired??? That was not covered under warranty. If it is something on the inside after that brief of time and a watch that is over 200.00 , should not stop working. The repair cost 89.00 to fix. I like Seiko but this one just really have some defaluts to it."
2,mole chaser,"worked okay for awhile, then the moles got used to it and it did not work on them very well after that. The battery's go dead after awhile and then they dont work at all."
2,A rehash in abbreviated form.,"Readers who think they are going to get 223 pages of political and social witticisms for their $24.95 are in for a rude awakening. The book is divided alphabetically, and each introductory letter takes one page; this is followed by a completely blank page. Following this, the New Rules are largely accompanied by small B+W photos for illustrative purposes taking up much of the space. Each New Rule also has two title lines in larger print. My most generous estimate is that the book contains perhaps 80 pages of actual content, much of which is available for free on the website of his TV show. Sure, he's a funny guy, but he's putting the screws to the consumer big-time here. How about this for a New Rule: no books of critical satire allowed whose content could fit comfortably in the TV Guide."
3,A Rule a Day Keeps the Doctor Away,"Why haven't they made this into a day calendar? After reading it in about 48 hours, it feels more like a light meal than a worthy read. Bill Maher's usually provocativity and lack of self-restraint shines through in this new book that bashes just about anyone who deserves to be bashed. The book will entertain Left and Right-wingers alike.My personally reccomendation is to buy the book, and read one or two rules a day. Some rules are gems, others...not so much. Spreading out your reading of the book will, if my own experiences are any indication, make it much more fulfilling.God Bless you all this Christmas season,RSM"
4,Looking at it with Humor,Great humor Bill Maher can be way out there some would like to set him up for treason. He is just practicing his God given Freedom. Very humorous great reading not mindless but enjoyable. Be prepared for his off the wall wackiness!
5,New Rules: Satire With a Bite of Insightful Humor,I love Bill Maher and watch his show every week of the season. He never fails to entertain and inform. New Rules offers his brand of humor and insights into our political and social dispositions and dilemnas. I gave it as a Christmas gift to my husband and we just howl.We love it!
3,I have a rule for you,This is a great book for those that have the attention span of a gnat and the IQ of a newt. Just some everyday observations rudely put to paper. Could fit the whole book into 20 pages but like a teenager trying to milk the 20 page paper - everything is big print and lot (LOTS) of spaces between paragraphs.If you buy for less than a dollar then it's a good deal and Bill can afford to go to McD's this week.
3,Okay but more of the same,I am an on again off again fan of Maher but generally like what he has to say other than when he gets on to pushing his own political agenda instead of being entertaining. So I bought this book with a little hesitation but its okay. Nothing to write home about but thought provoking which is what I like Maher for. Thats about all there is to say ... thought provoking and not terribly new
2,Predictable,"After reading the positive reviews, I thought to give this a listen.Bill Maher probably considers himself edgy and in the forefront of new comedy but does he ever have anything but convention opinions? I didn't see evidence of it in this anthology..."
1,Don't know how to get it,"I bought it and I really like Bill Maher, but the book is in a cloud somewhere and I don't know how to get it."
2,Disappointed and disgusted.,"I have always enjoyed Bill Mayer's humor. I was a fan of his previous show ""Politically Incorrect"" and watch his current program occasionally when I have access to HBO.Some of the one-liners in this book were funny, some were clever, but on the whole I was put off by the smut and the frequent scatalogical remarks. It is not a book I would recommend to friends, family or neighbors."
2,SOMEWHAT TEDIOUS,THIS STARTS OUT BEING TYPICALLY MAHER FUNNY. AFTER READING ABOUT HALF WAY IT BEGINS TO BE TEDIOUS &REPETITIVE.
5,Something For Everyone,"I was going to title this review ""Some Funny Observations"" but quickly realized that was not accurate. This had tons of funny observations. Nobody is spared, not the Republicans, not the Democrats and certianly not Paris Hilton and other members of the ""rich and famous."" Bill Maher's real strength and appeal comes from the fact that he will point out the absurd wherever it exists. There is no hypocrisy here. Unlike pundits on the right and left, who tend to have a very narrow scope, Maher spares nobody. Yes, he does tend to go after the right more than the left, but hey, the right is running everything. There is nothing more inane than reading a book where someone like Sean Hannity slams the left, that is a lot like kicking someone that is down and completely out. My only knock on this book? It is kind of short, I read it in one night. However, many of the observations are so funny, that I will go back to them again and again."
4,Classic Maher,"If you love his show you will love his book. Written as he speaks, you can hear Maher's voice in your head delivering the material. Quite a few laughing out loud moments, the only reason I gave this book 4 stars was because I think there should have been more. I read the whole thing in a couple hours, and that was with breaks. For the price, I think we should have gotten a bigger book but buy it used like I did and that problem is solved.If you love Maher, buy the book."
1,Felipe in Baja,"I read this book and can see why it is now only $3.00. It was way over priced at $14.00. As a matter of fact it is way overpriced at $3.00. Maher isn't a comedian. He is an overpaid, over hyped Hater. Just my opinion.If anyone knows of something funny he has said or done, please let me know. He looks funny but that's the end of his entertainment value. Maybe he should just sell photos of himself looking funny."
2,Ego te absolvo,Let me start with a disclamer. I love Bill for his brilliance and unique sense of humor.But the CD's I attempted to listen are quite painful. Monotonous litany of New Rules that are impossible to listen for more than 10 minutes at a time. Great example of how not to present comedy material.Bill now I am convinced you are a catholic.
1,What a disappointment,"I like Bill Maher, I always have. This book, though... it's terrible. It has barely 5 pages worth of content and the ""comedy"" is extremely lazy. If Bill wants to be the next Jay Leno, this is certainly a step in that direction. Need a quick punchline? Throw in Michael Jackson. Use ""gay"" as an insult and use it often. Throw in a Paris Hilton joke. It's been done and done and done to death. I expected more from Bill Maher. Bill, what happened to you? Negative 5 stars."
4,He took the words out of my mouth.,"I've always liked what Bill had to say on TV and needed a light read so I got New Rules. Now I'm one who agrees with 90% of what he has to say so this was easy for me to like. A few of the rules are already dated at 5 years old, and George W. Bush is mentioned 200 times, but those are the only faults. Whether Bill was talking Religion, Politics or sex, I laughed a lot. A few of those were full-body laughs, just short of dry-heaving. The book is 1/3 photos, and I bet I read the whole thing in two hours. He has a cd of this also. In this country we can't all think alike, but if a few more people thought like Bill it would definitely be a good thing. I mean who couldn't go for some weed and a bj right now?"
3,A mediocre book for such an outstanding comedian,"I'm a big bill maher fan. unfortunately this book was just a rehash of all his new rules from his hbo show (perhaps a few new new rules). The book goes A through Z and has several new rules for each letter along with a longer new rule at the end of each letter which is similar to his closing prose on ""real time"".While often funny and occasionally hilarious, I was looking for more in this book which is why i can only give this book 3 of 5 stars. Luckily i check this out from the library. (by the way look at the price of the used books... this might suggest something)"
3,This is a book?,"I love Bill Maher's comedy and political insight but I can't recommend this ""book"". Upon first glance, it is a thin work, then when you read it, you see just how you were ripped off. If the publisher didn't adjust the margins and blank areas to add length, this work could have been easily contained in 30-40 pages. There are multiple pages with no text at all. If you can wait to buy this used for a huge discount, I recommend that you do so."
5,New rules,"I suppose if you like dennis miller's old HBO show you would like bill maher , but to really understand and like the book you would have to know maher watch some of his specials all in all i thought the book was equaly as informative as it was humourous"
2,We deserved More!,"Don't get me wrong, it was funny, but to me, when you charge $14 for a 240 page book I deserve a 240 page book. Easily 1/3 of the book were blank pages, pages with 1-4 lines of text, or empty pages except for his New Rules title. Even the pages that did contain rules were 1/2 full. This was, at best, an 80 page pamphlet spread out over 240 pages. Honestly, I feel that Maher mailed this one in. Do yourself a favor and pick up ""When you ride alone you ride with Bin Laden"" its a much more substantive book.In other words ""New Rule: A 240 page book should be 240 pages of material."""
1,trash,bill maher is a really good example of the coarsening of current american culture. i can see how you might find him amusing if you love clinton or hate bush...but that isn't exactly will rogers.
1,Garbage,"Bill Maher continues to prove that he is one of the most ingnorant, stupid people in America.This book confirms that."
1,Preening and Pandering,"One of the five-star reviews here says that Maher's NEW RULES book is ""perfect bathroom reading.""I agree: especially the bathroom part when I need paper."
1,Truly a Blue State Schmuck,"This guy strugles to be funny but his Far-left agenda always gets in the way. Any reviewer who recommends the cheap garbage he presents as ""witty"" is not just illiterate but politically motivated. Don't fall for it . He is NOT what he hopes you think he is. Lousy book and lousy talent."
1,"hate bill maher, end of story","dudes, this freakin idiot tears down every good thing about our society and replaces it with waht? more sh**. worse sh**. there's only one way to deal with people like this -- tie their eyelids open so they have to watch endless h ours of their own tedious sh**. after that, maybe they will come to a profound understanding of how irrelevant they are, and maybe become, like, loggers. i'm out. j."
3,#1 reason to buy the book...Constantine...mmmmm,I will buy the book because it has Constantine Maroulis in it!!
1,Nope,"This book isn't funny, but it's piercing and intelligent. There are scores of well placed blows (most below the belt) to common hypocrisy and senselessness. But. Using a picture depicting a young woman's pain and horror (a picture which also allegorizes the senseless destruction wrought on the Vietnamese people by the US air force) as a gag doesn't work. Why is it tasteless and offensive? Because it uses someone's real suffering for a cheap gag about Lara Flynn Boyle's figure. Bill Maher should be supported - he makes observations the rest of us harbor secretly. But until he learns that using real pain for a gag without any depth makes him a worthless hack, don't give him your money."
1,More Hate from a Hateful Little Man,"A very thin (lots of empty space and other filler) book of ""progressive"" hate speech masquerading under the theme of humor. An easy test which this fails completely is the substitute quiz. If we substitute say Michelle Obama for Ann Coulter as the butt of the ""jokes"" in this screed, would it be considered racist hate speech? Absolutely.A great book if you are a ""progressive"" hater. Otherwise worthless dreck."
2,"A little humility goes a long, long way.","I've watched Bill on HBO and have enjoyed both his series and his standup specials. Also, I agree with much of what he says about our present day situation in Iraq and with our incompetent and recalcitrant presidency. This book however, fails for one notable reason.Bill Mahrer is smart, engaging and funny. The biggest problem I have with his work is his smugness and patronizing condescension which tends to cloud most of the work he's done. It's fine to approach a discussion with the knowledge that one is in the right, but coming in with the right, respectful attitude will go beyond merely winning the argument. It will win you the respect of both sides."
5,Hilarious!,"Great job, Bill. Very funny and very politically savvy. I throughly enjoyed this book. Get it now."
5,New Rule: This is required reading,A special treat for the HBO-less who haven't been privy to these New Rules before. Brilliantly insightful and hilarious.
4,Rough and raw,"Some readers may be surprised by his audacity with the printed word and its' presumptive underpinning. On TV, he's quite the smooth orator, almost always persuasive and articulate.""New Rules"" is something like his movie ""Religulous""; often hilarious, but too often falling back on tired stuff better left in the gutter.His bit on public ""breast feeding"" will generate laughs, but they are over and out - something like his expose of a religious cultist in the above-mentioned film, who indulges in ritualistic (?) marihuana smoking. Bill (appears to) light one up too and we say...got the point...but we're well past Woodstock."
2,Bill Maher is always worth listening too but this is not his best work,This collection of observations is pretty hit and miss. Many of the jokes are obviously excerpts from stand-up rountines and don't have the impact when read on a page rather than being delivered on-stage. There are some really funny comments but many others just bomb. Another disappointment is that there is simply not that much material here and what there is is scattershot - the whole enterprise would have benefited from a cohesive theme. Bill Maher's iconoclastic perspective is great but this is simply not his best work.
2,A bit disappointing,"This book is just a collection of about 200 paragraphs, most of them short, each covering a different idea, topic or area of comment. More than just a handful were trivial; a lot were of no real interest, and only a handful were really worth reading. Only a few tickled my funny-bone."
4,Funny but short,"I enjoyed this book. Even though I don't agree with Bill Maher 75% of the time, it is still interesting to read his ideas. The only drawback is that the book really isn't very long. But that should be expected since it is just a book of his new rules, and not a novel. I would recommend it to any fans of Bill Maher or anyone who just wants to see things from a different perspective."
5,New Rules by Bill Maher,I love this book !! -and Bill Maher's brain!.. The way Bill tells the truth and then makes you laugh when just the truth along would make you cry. Thankyou Bill ! I am telling all my freinds and family to get your book and enjoy while getting educated !
4,Someone with a public forum finally says it!,"Unlike the gutless news anchors and political shills one finds ""commentating"" on cable news channels, Bill Maher has an obsession with being reasonable, honest and pretty fair. This book is funny, yet manages to refute many of the oft repeated political lies we're all being fed on a regular basis by mostly everyone else on TV. It's such a relief to see someone reasonable and honest get a forum for their thoughts on TV and in print. This book is a little short, with a bit too much dead space on some pages, but most of the print that is in it is terrific, smart and funny. Buy this book!"
3,"Meh.. Amusing, on point, toilet reading","Not so much a book as much as a collection of random opinions. It's amusing, and I agree with most of what he says. I hardly think it should have been a hardback book though. Its more in line with the little water damaged pocket books you leave sitting on your toilet tank. I picked it up for $3.99 on the clearance rack at Borders, that's about what it's worth, buy it used if you buy it on here.That being said...I'd buy it again."
2,Better watched than read perhaps,I loved Politically Incorrect but this book was a disappointment. There were occasional gems but way to many strident and repetitive bits. Maher is cabable of some incredible incisive satire but it happened to infrequently in this one.
5,Great Political Humorist,"I listened to the audio version of this book and I had a blast. Unfortunately it was a short book. I caught myself laughing numerous times throughout. I think Bill Maher is a great political humorest that takes jabs at a wide spectrum of people, both in the media and government. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a laugh and to get a dose of some common sense (I know, common sense is an oxymoron).Highly recommended."
4,Stuff From the Show,"Which, really, isn't a bad thing, especially if you haven't seen the shows. Very funny stuff here and some good ""rules"". If you have seen the show, get it anyway just to share with friends.Basically, New Rules is a compilation of the best of the New Rules from his show on HBO. It's a quick easy read and will have you laughing. Bill comments on just about everything, even politics (who'd a thought!). Most of the rules are a paragraph in length. A good bedside book."
4,Very Funny,"I don't agree with a lot of what Bill Maher says, and yes, sometimes he can be a little crude and smart-alecky. And yes, this is a very slight book. But it's hysterically funny--his editorial on Jennifer Willbanks, ""the Runaway Bride,"" is a classic.A perfect book to pick up when you need a few quick laughs to boost your morale. Well done, Bill!"
4,Very Funny in a Realistic Way,"He had a little dirtier mouth than I thought but I love his thoughts on politics and his take on life in general. I read it, co-worker read it and now my son is reading it. A must read."
3,Don't Let the Kids Hear This,"""New Rules"" is funny but not as funny as Maher is on his TV program. I guess the double takes and bemused looks don't translate on a CD of just the book. A word to the wise, this CD, like most of Maher's material is definitely for adults. It would be rated ""L"" for language, which is pretty vulgar."
2,Sigh.,"Page 110: ""... it's why Bill Clinton never started a war.""The bombing of Yugoslavia counts as a war.Page 214: ""Oh sure, I know what you're saying: upper-middle-class Caucasian teens whoring? That's something that happens to other people's kids. ... The joke here, of course, is on white America, which always feels superior to blacks and often shows it with their feet, moving out of more problematic urban areas. ...""Bill Maher's attacks against white people show he does know a lot about racism because he has that mindset. Read between the lines."
1,"Love Bill Maher, Hated the Book","Love Bill Maher in person and some of his written material. However, I have to say I didn't like this book. It took me a couple of hours to wade through it.....short and not so sweet. Too much about Homosexuality and Sex. While I dont have a problem with either topic, I was looking for Bill's popular political bites and there is plenty of material out there for that topic. To my mind he missed the boat on this one."
2,not the best format for this type of humor,"Bill Maher is a funny, pretty well-informed guy with mainly libertarian views on politics; his blunt style can offend at times (especially all the *extremely* bitter parts about women, marriage and relationships--it sounds like he's still angry over rejection of some kind?), but is usually laugh-out-loud hilarious. That said, I didn't really like the format of New Rules. It seemed like too many rapid fire jokes at once; there's a reason the segment on the show ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" isn't the *entire* show--it just feels like too much after awhile. So, while there are some truly funny moments in this book, after awhile the hyper-sarcastic, whiny tone begins to wear thin. If you want to read a book by Maher, check out When You Ride Alone, You Ride with Bin Laden--it's still a collection of brief observations, but they're more fleshed out and less pedantic."
1,B List Movie Actor,"A B List movie actor, wannabe intellectual and hack commedian tells every conservative why they suck. He then pretends to speak truth to power while spouting all the conventional wisdom of the Hollywood left. Sooooooo brave. See you in hell Bill. On second thought, maybe I won't."
2,no power cord included,price is fine but they did not include the main power cord.i week later they try to sell me a power cord for $3.00.very LAME!I hate when sellers show you photos of what you are looking for and then sell otherwise.
3,"Excellent price, fair ability for Air Leak Detector","Dirt cheap for an ultrasonic air leak detector but I needed it to find compressed air leaks in a very noisy manufacturing environment. It picked up a lot of other noise like shop fans, etc. and I got a lot of reflection off of hard surfaces so it was hard to pinpoint even a very large leak. For the price, it can't be beat. I bought a MUCH more expensive unit to meet my needs."
4,Bought it for daughter,"She is challenged by it, but there are still some songs that she can pick up quickly. Watch the language in the lyrics for kids, of course."
5,More live Crimson for the masses.,"Granted, Robert Fripp has created a whole new industry with all the live Crimson material released in the past few years. However, Crimson fanatics (like me) can't get enough of this stuff. This set includes much material from the aforementioned live releases, but most of it is previously unreleased. Especially interesting are the two cuts from the '72 lineup - a scorching rendition of Schizoid Man (I believe from the live Earthbound LP) and a real treat, Ladies Of The Road (from Islands). Also, the live performance of Dinosaur by the current lineup will literally blow you out of your chair. A beautiful limited-edition mini-album sleeve, a nice booklet with loads of photos, an enhanced CD-ROM section, a more-than-reasonable price for a 2-CD set...how could any loyal Crimsonite go wrong? If you don't have the cash for all those live Crimson releases out there, this is the perfect sampler."
4,"They take you to heaven, they take you to hell","Why, the hell, Robert Fripp bands, called King Crimson, can not bring us one perfect piece of art? Why 90% of the objective listeners use to pick up their favorites from every disc, while skipping the strange-noisy rest of it? Why can't they put the remote control away, when Crimson is played? Anyway, Crimson is very special band (or may i say ""bands""?) and ""Cirkus"" is a fine collection of their live concerts by the yrs 1970-1998. Personaly, i prefered the early days of the vocalists Greg Lake and John Wetton. The rest, with Adrian Belew has its ups and downs, but worth buying it."
5,Great,"This comic is awesome. It has Aliens, Predators, humans, and guns. Chestburster action also. The movie is set way in the future. The predators have now captured Alien Queens so she can make eggs. Then, the Predators put the eggs in an area on a planet where there's life that can get impregnated by the Face Huggers. Then, the predators go and hunt the Aliens. But, something goes wrong on one of these trips. The ship carrying the eggs explodes, the Aliens are let on the loose, they invade a humanized colony, bad stuff happens, people die, The main protagonist who happens to be a Predator is introduced, and stuff happens. Awesome comic, and a must have."
1,Could have been good.,"But he picked the absolute slimiest people to interview. Is an avatar sex scene really necessary? I think not. If the director had chosen a range of people, it would have been much more realistic."
3,A very helpful tool in learning English as a Second Language,Gave it 3 stars because the book is wonderful but it didn't come with the CD. I bought the used copy.The new one is just way too high for my budget.
2,Not so good.,"I found this book to be remedial and bland. But then again, so was the TA who taught my class. Read Wikipedia and save yourself a hundred bucks."
3,A soggy reading of Pulcinella and Baiser de la Fee,"I don't need another Firebird Suite by any means, but I thought that the very talented Yuri Temirkanov would perform the Divertimento from The Fairy's Kiss, one of Stravinsky's rare romantic works, and the Pulcinella Suite, a peppery reworking of Pergolesi, with real spark and panache. Those qualities are in abundance in his other Stravinsky CDs but not onthis one.Both works are sluggish and soupy, with no trace of neo-classical wit and pointed delicacy. If you want swooning readings of these two delightful works, this is the CD for you, but I found even the Firebird unusually muted, except for those moments when the percussion exploded out of the speakers and made me jump out of my seat (not in a good way)."
5,THE THOUGHT EXCHANGE ... INDISPENSABLE!,"David Friedman generously, deeply, passionately, and intelligently gives the reader the tools to a sensational life. I can honestly feel positive change in my life by applying the teachings of this book. It works! THOUGHT EXCHANGE is not easy, and it's not magic. It takes strength and courage. It takes thoughtful, disciplined work, and trust in the universe. Thank you David Friedman for sharing your wealth of discoveries and daring me to have a sensational life!By Jill Melanie Wirth, New York City"
1,GOOD IDEA - POOR DESIGN,SKIRT IS POORLY DESIGN. WELCRO STRIP THAT IS GLUED TO UHDER SIDE IS NOT HOLDING AT ALL. I'VE CLEANED VERY GOOD BEFORE INSTALATION WITH ALCOHOL AND IT'S STILL FALLING OFF. THERE IS NO AJUSTMENT FOR HEIDHT - ON SITE WITH SLOPE IT IS EITHER TOO LOW OR TOO HIGH. PLASTIC STAKES ARE USELESS ON ASFALT AND SANDY SURFACE AND WIND WILL BLOW IT AWAY.
2,Just add water.,"Ernest R. Ranucci and Wilma E. Rollins, Curiosities of the Cube (Thomas Y. Crowell, 1977)This is listed as a YA book, but given the way it's written, I'm thinking the teen set will have a pretty rough go of it before they've at least gotten halfway through their first geometry course, and I can't really see them enjoying it much. Ranucci and Rollins introduce the cube, with chapters on putting hem together, taking them apart, games you can play with them, and that sort of thing, but it's written more in the style of a research paper than a book aimed at math laymen; this is likely to throw some people off. Some good information, but not well-presented. **"
3,Average quality,"I purchased this for my children to use at home. The product worked ok at first, but now after a few years of use, it has become harder to sharpen pencils even with new batteries (the mechanism has to work much harder now to perform the task). I would say that you probably get what you pay for. The product is well priced compared to other battery operated sharpeners, but the quality doesn't seem to hold up for more than a few years. Maybe I shouldn't expect more than a few years of usage out of this anyway."
5,satellite tv,"dish network 500 dish is the work horse of satelite tv, i have had one since 1998 an it faded so i bought a new one just to have that new look."
5,"Brand NEW, Everything accounted for.","What can I say. Its a brand new dish. Everything was included, and it works great. Don't hesitate to purchase to expand your viewing areas.I do recommend the purchase of a signal strength meter for aligning. The on board meter that comes with the receiver is not very accurate."
1,Don't install it on your roof!,"If you plan on getting dish Network and you have to install it on your roof I would seriously think twice before proceeding.I always try to avoid problems, It is easier to prevent something than to fix it.This does not always work especially when sleazy sales people LIE!I specifically asked if they EVER have problems with roofs leaking from the heavy Dish being screwed into the shingles and through the plywood part of the roof- BEFORE they installed it- I was assured that they did not.Well as you can see from my video (if it uploads) I have a 6ft long 1 1/2 foot wide water mark on my ceiling right exactly where the DISH was installed and I'm steaming MAD. The roof is only 3 years old. So it's not a coinkydink.opt for exterior wall or pole installation if you get a DISH.Video didn't upload :( I dunno why I can't send my videos from my smart phone to my email. I can only send them to YOU TUBE. Look up Leaky Roof on there to see the damage done."
5,It just works!,"It works like it's supposed to. For me, very easy to set up. I use it when I go camping. Just as easy to setup as the old Dish 500.Shipper kept me notified of all the movements, arrived earlier than estimated."
5,Pleasently surprised,"First time buyer, I didn't know what to expect but I was totally impressed with the speed of getting my order, the dish was in new condition and works perfectly. I would and will use Amazon again."
3,Disappointed,"Item was not packaged very well. Missing screws, and I'm not quite sure all items are new. Product worked after a trip to the hardware store. Tried to E-mail seller twice as to whether item was going to be shipped or not. Never got a response. Though the item did reach me on the last day of the deadline."
1,"This movie was a PERFECT example of what not to do, ever.","I rented the movie due to Steve Carell, Josh Hartnett, James Gandolfini, and Paul Walker being displayed on the cover... I can honestly say I have never been more let down and disappointed in a movie before in my entire life. It's a perfect example of how NOT to make a movie, and my respect for the actors in the movie just took a huge hit. If I had to choose between watching American Breakdown one more time and being tied to a chair forced to watch ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" for 48 hours straight I wouldn't hesitate for a second --- tie me down."
1,Like It Says on the Cover - Live and Learn,"As other reviewers have mentioned, it is very rare that I will actually turn off a bad movie rather than watch any more of it. American Breakdown was a movie I made an exception for. I didn't even bother fast forwarding any further to see if it would get bettter, I just knew it wouldn't. Every minute longer that I watched it made me feel like more of a sucker for getting taken by RedBox and the fraud they pull off with movies like this. Start-studded cast, glitzy cover and complete garbage under the covers. I want to like you Red Box but this is beneath you."
3,An OK series of movies that deal with finding meaning in life. Better then Guilty Hearts. Watchable. I say B-,"""Instead of the end mabye we just found the beginning."" A series of short movies that involve people looking for meaning in thier lives. This is a movie filled with symbolism, most of it I am not smart enough to fully get. Like ""Guilty Hearts"" this is a series of movies that have the same idea but are not connected. Unlike ""Guilty Hearts"" this one is easy to watch. There is really not much to review here as it is not a typical movie. If you are into art-house like independent movies this is a great one to watch. The cast and acting is great, the movie is OK, if you like this kind of thing. Overall, not bad, but again this is the type of movie that only appeals to certain people. I give it a B-.Would I watch again? - I doubt it.*Also try - Guilty Hearts & New York I Love You"
1,A movie that makes you question your priorities,"In my case, is trying to save money in my new apartment by not getting Internet worth it? I discovered tonight that I am capable of being shanghai'd by redbox into renting movies like American Breakdown, so no, it's not. Without time to do the right research, I am in danger of renting any kind of lousy bad art trash just because Steve Carrell and James Gandolfini are in it (what were they thinking?) This is a very bad movie. I am calling Comcast tomorrow."
1,"My brain hurts, Mr. Gumby!","The six pieces of artsy-farsy garbage that comprise AMERICAN BREAKDOWN (aka ""Stories USA"") are collectively the absolute worst nonsense I've seen this year. I kept watching, expecting something interesting to happen, but was ultimately very disappointed. A bonus is the migraine this thing gave me.It's noisy, it's ilogical, it's spastic, it's an exercise in total cinematic pretension. This picture also sets the record for the longest credit scroll of all time: EIGHT MINUTES.Guess what? The emperor doesn't have any clothes, nor a raison d'tre.Congratulations to all involved for actually scraping BENEATH the bottom of the cinematic barrel.Avoid at all costs. You have been warned! (Hey REDBOX: I want my dollar back!)Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.(3.4) American Breakdown (2007) - James Gandolfini/Josh Hartnett/Paris Hilton/Joe Mantegna/Louis Gossett Jr./Scott Caan/Ken Hudson Campbell"
1,Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr,Don't Watch. Would elaborate but couldn't live with myself if I wasted any more time of my life in regards to this movie. Just trying to save others.
1,Worst movie ever,"I rented this movie from Redbox out of pure curiosity, and based on the cast, it looked like it could be alrightEasily the worst ""movie"" I have ever seen. If I could give it negative stars, I would. First off, it wasn't even a movie, it was 5 short stories (I turned it off after 2) that had no relation to each other whatsoever. The movie quality was awful, the plot lines were attrocious. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS."
1,Why didn't read the reviews first?,"Stop now! Do not even think about buying, let alone renting this movie. I thought that the big name actors would have brought this film justice, but I was wrong. Also, I am not hater, as I watch many films and give them their due. However, this movie tricked me by using these big name actors that I felt it was imperative to write a review about this project so that I could save someones time and money. Thank you for listening, if you still don't believe me continue reading the rest of the reviews."
1,OUCH!,I rented it because of the cast. I feel bad for them and now myself for seeing even a part of this confused mess of wasted talent. Please pass on this one!!
1,Do not waste ANY $$ on this,I have never reviewed anything before but this sucked so bad I had to share in the hopes of saving someone else.
1,"agreed with everyone, is this a joke??","everyone's already said it. this is the worst movie ever made. made it through the whole thing by halfway watching it while online, but is this some kind of joke? it made no sense. all you people who say its ""deep"", thats because cognitive dissonance was trying to make you not feel like you were wasting your life by watching it and trying to help you justify the mistake. believe me, i tried to do the same. especially during the trippy josh hartnett section, but what just happened? was that even a movie? what was redbox thinking? I have to think this was some kind of ""let's see how many people we can trick into watching this?"" kind of deal. the paragraph at the end of the credits leaves me to think this as well. don't rent this movie. or let anyone else rent it. sadly i'll end up paying $3 for it....when was it even filmed? other question...."
1,Can I give Zero Stars?,"I was actually excited to watch this movie based on the plot description and the character list.. When it started I literally asked, ""Is this a joke?""By far the worst movie ever made in the history of man-kind, or anything that came before it and anything after.Please don't waste your money like I did.This should have been called The Ring 3 because you will probably die after watching it."
1,Lessons learned.,"Ok, so I thought I could enjoy a movie with a cast like this... wrong. This movie was designed to provide karma to me for pirating it. This is the last time I ever copy a movie. You win FBI. Thanks for funding this horrible video to deter me. If you pay for this, you will regret it. If you do not pay for this.... you will regret it still. My TV even hates me now for playing this. I am going to go watch Brokeback Mountain to get this out of my mind."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"Me and my boyfriend only got about twenty minutes into the movie, so I guess I can't really rate the entire thing. The first story was awful, and the second (with Steve Carell) was even worse."
1,HORRIBLE,LITERALLY THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!DON'T WASTE YOUR DOLLARZERO STARSNEGATIVE ZEROYOU WOULD THINK THESE GREAT ACTORS WOULD MAKE A GREAT PICTURE....HELL NO! TERRIBLE
2,"Felt bad there were no two star reviews yet, so...","There were too many one star reviews and no two star reviews, so, I thought I would fill the gap between the one star reviews and the three star reviews with the two star review, which you are now reading. I hope this helps your decision to not buy or watch this movie. It was really bad. I mean, really really really bad. But, if you are like me, you will be curious and will watch it anyway. And then you will hate yourself for not listening to me. Is it really worth the risk? No, it is not. The end."
2,Playmobil firetruck,"Too many small parts that we did not give to a two and a half year old. No instructions came with the toy and no original box, so it was hard to figure out how a couple of the small parts fit on. It was not age-rated, but should have said 4 and up. Will only buy toys I can see from now on. The other Playmobil toys for 1+ kids are the best, but they are sturdy and simple."
1,Original and good,This book is both original and good. The part that is good is not original and the part that is original is not good.
1,Silly,"This is another of those silly books written, no doubt, by some middle manager who wouldn't know how to even begin to handle problems. Where do all these breauacrats come from?"
3,"So, so...............","The CD was ok. Appreciate the effort to put the album together, and although I am a fan of the ""Girls,"" I just wasn't into the sound of this particular CD."
5,Moving rhythm with undertones of meaning,This CD doesn't let down the Indigo Girls' followers and fans. The music is pulsating and the lyrics have so much to say. Complete enjoyment.
5,I love every song!!,"This album has great lyrics, harmony, and vocals....it is my favorite album by them and a must for any indigo girls fan!!!"
5,One of the best...,"Amy Ray and Emily Saliers are two of the most gifted musicians on the scene today. Not since Simon & Garfunkle have two individuals blended voices so seemlessly. Their harmonies are haunting and stunning. Their lyrics are poetic and their passion, honest. This album contains some of their best music to date. Whether they be lamenting history on ""This Train Revised"" or glorifying true love on ""Power of Two"" these two women arrange and deliver honest, beautiful and moving music. An amazing collection of music."
3,"There's life down below me, though","I like a few of the songs off this CD, but it is by far their best effort. For me it was very much same song, second verse. I appreciate that their laid back lyrical style has persisted over decades, now, but beyond about three tracks on this CD, I found it boring. Just not for me."
4,Not stiff enough,"After reading the review which says it needs to be reinforced, I assumed that it would just start getting loose over time. This gooseneck however, is loose from the start. It looks and feels great. The threading didn't give me any problems. I will however, need to invest in some of that copper wire to put inside for added strength.If I could just make a suggestion: If you're putting thick copper wire inside of this stand to make it stiffer, please use shielded wire and wrap the ends in electrical tape. The last thing you want to do with analog electronic equipment is make it conduct more electricity. On top of that, the shielding will minimize vibration noise when positioning the mic or recording audio.Overall, nice for the price and a solid purchase. It just needs a bit of DIY love to make it perfect (as is the case with almost any musical instrument)."
1,Funny - NO WAY !!!! Pathetic - YES !,1. Don't bother reading it. 2. I bought it because of the reviews and I have wasted my money. 3. The author jumps about various topics. 4. There is no coherent structure to the contents of the book. 5. If any of this is true - the author needs serious help!!! 6. If none of this is true - why the book ??
4,"A quick, enjoyable book","I found myself laughing out loud when reading ""Just Checking."" The author is a terrific writer and has a sharp, sarcastic sense of humor. She's terrific with details. I just finished a long, seriously haunting novel and found ""Just Checking"" to be a refreshing respite. It's smart and sassy."
5,"A hysterically funny, dark, moving OCD memoir","Emily Colas is an amazing writer. I loved JUST CHECKING and read it in one sitting. Colas reminds me of David Sedaris--her humor is biting, her perceptions keen, and the events she recounts are eminently memorable. This isn't a book only for obsessive-compulsives--it's for everyone who recognizes that type of behavior in themselves. From AS GOOD AS IT GETS to Howard Stern, to our own personal obsessions about gas leaks or catching a disease from a public phone, this book is about a topic to which we can all relate."
3,OCD,"This book is about a woman with OCD. Anyone wanting to know about OCD would like this book. I personally thought this book was hilarious, just thinking someone could be soo crazy. I recomend this book."
2,Eh... forgettable,"This is a book full of sad short stories with no direction. By the end I didn't care about the narrator, and truthfully, I don't remember much of it -- except that her husband put up with a lot more craziness than I would have."
4,Don't Try This At Home,"Ms. Colas does a fine job with this skinny book that makes OCD somewhat accessible to the general public. Interesting was that I found this book in the humor section. More interesting is the fact that Ms. Colas portrays OCD as a fluffy, quirky inconvenience. I don't think this was her aim though.But remember...OCD is a serious disease that you wouldn't wish upon your worst enemy. Individual results may vary."
2,Profoundly disappointing,"I am a psychiatrist, and hoped to glean some insights into OCD that would enhance my work with patients. I also hoped to be amused, since the book's advance praise suggested the book made good points while being humorous. I was so disappointed. The book is an easy read, but becomes boring quickly. The writing is rather drab, and the potential of this subject is lost. The writer seems to have little insight into her behavior and has little to share and teach others. A waste of $12."
4,A good look into the life of a woman suffering from OCD,"I just finished reading Just Checking last night. I'm not sure why, but for some reason I like reading books of essays by people who suffer from OCD. Well, I think it's probably because I can see myself in some of the situations that I'm reading. While I suffer no where near as severely as Emily Colas, I still have a few minor issues of my own! Maybe you should read this book in order to get in touch with your own OCD tendencies...I found this book to be a quick read because the pace was kept up nicely. I recommend to anyone curious about the worlds of people who suffer from OCD and the different steps and measures involved with overcoming it."
4,It's surprising she's still alive,"I read this book and cringed for Emily Colas. The type of obsessive-compulsive disorder she possesses is so pulverizing, it will make you think twice about some of your own little quirks and foibles. She exhibits great courage and little self-consciousness about her disease. This level of OCD can be unusually difficult to treat, so they tell me, and the fact that Colas is still with us, hasn't mutilated herself beyond recognition, can still laugh, understands how far she can go (and has gone)...well, it's nothing short of amazing. The writing style leaves a little to be desired, but the book's short length is about all anyone could stand to read about OCD. My hat is off to the author. I also promise I will NEVER check to see if the glass rim has a chip on it ever again."
5,One of my new favorite Christmas CDs,"I found a copy of this CD in a used CD store and had to listen to it because of the name. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. This is NOT your typical Christmas album, but it is A LOT of fun. I played it at work and it became a hit there as well. From a rousing rendition of ""grinch"" to a very catchy version of the Peanuts christmas tune, you'll be very entertained. And if you've ever wondered where to get ""Silent Night"" played on the saw, well here it is."
4,We wish you a non-denominational holiday.,"The Asylum Street Spankers are a band that plays music in an irreverent, ""old timey"" acoustic style. This Christmas album was recorded live over two days in 2000 (although the last song on the album is not a live recording). The songs are all covers of older songs, with the exception of ""12.25.61"", in which bandleader Wammo laments having his birthday fall on Christmas day. This is a very fun, unique Christmas album."
3,Too warm,"It does cook a little warmer than they used to. I was cooking a 5 lb pork roast on low with some apples and onions figuring it would take about 6-7 hours, but the water in the pot was boiling after 4! Usually, when water boils in a crock pot, the meat's done.The warming setting has proved useful though. I've adapted to the higher temperature of cooking and I just pick a shorter time than I usually would and let it slowly cook for a little longer on ""warm"".Food out of it always tastes good and the stoneware is super easy to clean."
1,Item is dangerous and should be recalled,"I have had this Crock-Pot for about 2 years. And today is the last I will use it! I can put a frozen roast in it & it will be done in 4 to 6 hours. That's with 2 hours on high & 4 hours on low. I only will use it if I'm home to watch it. It get too hot on the outside of the unit (yes, it would burn a child) and the counter top under the unit gets too hot. Every couple of hours I will move the unit around a little so it doesn't stay in the same spot on the counter, just don't want to take a chance. Within 6 to 8 months of purchase, the handles started to slowly chip away. I know I should have returned it right then, but I really couldn't believe it. I take really good care of my things & they usually last way beyond their years. In fact I bought this to replace my slow cooker of 30 years (that I used so much) & how I'm kicking myself! There wasn't a thing wrong with my old one, it just looked outdated."
1,Burns everything - even on warm setting,"I have two of these, because the company sent me another one after I complained that mine burned my food even on the ""warm"" setting. The new unit did the exact same thing. Now, that I see the other reviews on Amazon I realize that it's simply a defective design and the company is still selling them anyway.It's more like a countertop oven, that will cook your food in record time and then proceed to burn it."
2,Look for something else!,"This was my first crock pot ever. I decided on this brand as it's ""suppose"" to be one of the best. WELL, the first 2-3 times I cooked pork tenderloin in it, it was absolutely PERFECT! Well, lately the last few times (I've had it now 3 mos) I put it on the 10 hr setting and it's done in 2-4 hours on LOW. WTH??? In the beginning, I put my roasts in the center ceramic unit in the refrigerator overnight to marinate, THEN brought it out and cooked it for 8-10 hours, worked great. You can ""not"" place room temp water and ceramic unit within the heating element in this crock pot without it over cooking. I've never been so mad when you buy a $20.00 piece of good MEAT and it's RUINED! I think I'll be trying Rival or Hamilton beach next."
3,Runs hot,"I've had the same experience as the others, with overcooked food in this crockpot. It needs to be watched, which defeats part of the purpose. Still, I did use it, with decent success. Mine just died after only 6 years, and I'm going to replace it with something else."
1,The warm function on this crock pot does NOT work.,"I purchased one of these crock pots because of it's programmable features and reasonable price. WHAT A MISTAKE. After a programmed setting the unit does go to the warm setting and the warm amber indicator lights up - HOWEVER - if you you manually put this crock pot on warm by pressing the ""cook time"" button - it gets real hot. I tested it with an oven thermometer to verify my suspicion and sure enough - when this crock pot is MANUALLY set to warm it goes to over 300 degrees (high).I took it back for a replacement but the 2nd one did the same thing.I contacted customer service (email only) and they gave me the royal run around with canned answers and proceeded to inform me after several emails, that I tested the temperature in an improper manner...I returned the 2nd one also.DO NOT BUY THIS CROCKPOT unless you want over cooked and/or burned food when MANUALLY using the ""warm"" setting. I'd have given this a zero star if that were available."
1,Horrible product quality,"We have always owned Rival crock pots in the past, but somebody else must be making this brand 'Crock Pot' now, because the entire experience is different. Don't get me wrong, the unit looks very nice, and if High meant high temperature and Low meant low temperature, this unit would be a perfect fit in many kitchens. However, low means 212 degrees on this unit, which will scald your soups and burn your slow cooked roast recipe. Warm is the only usable 'slow cook' setting on the entire unit, and even that is over 180 degrees (and is the setting that doesn't have a timer on it). If you are looking for a timed 'set and forget' unit, skip this one. You'll come home to overcooked or burnt meals."
1,PURCHASE AT YOUR OWN RISK!,"I had this crock pot for maybe 3-6 months when out of the blue it stopped working. The light would come on but it would not get hot. If I banged it against something or hit it a couple times it would come back on and stay on for the remaining time. However, a year later it no longer works. So the moral of the story is DO NOT BUY THIS ONE! I'm not sure if it was only a short in mine but I would not recommend finding out.The only reason it got 1 star is 0 stars doesn't work!"
1,Horrible!,"This Crock-pot is horrible!! As other reviews indicate, it does cook very hot. I have ruined so many dishes by cooking exactly to the recipe because it cooks too hot. Another issue I have with this is that you can only cook for 4-6 hours on high and 8-10 hours on low. I have many recipies that require cooking on low for 6 hours, which can't be done with this crock-pot. I am very disapointed and am now searching for another programmable crock-pot after having this one for less than 6 mos."
5,very satisfied,I have used this shampoo for several years now and I find it makes my hair thicker and fuller.I would not use anything but this. great product!
3,Welcome Back to the Housers,"OK release from one of my favorite bands. They have replaced Paul Hester on drums, and followed this with a tour that was great. This release lacks the poppy hits of the first Crowded House album, and the sophisticated melodies of ""Woodface"". Still, welcome back, new drummer and all!"
4,Crowded House have plenty of time on earth.,"Great album from start to finish. Lyrics are still strong and thought-provoking. Instrumentation is huge. My favorites are ""Say That Again,"" ""A Sigh,"" ""Nobody Wants To,"" and ""Walked Her Way Down."" Right now I'm giving this four, but maybe after a couple of months of digesting the album, the album could go five stars. ""Even a Child"" wasn't one of my favorites off the bat, but now it's not bad. I would say that it is my least favorite, but no skip overs on this disc. If you are into any of Crowded House's catalog, then I prod you to get this album. You get what you pay for."
4,Simply Good,"Crowded House is one of the most underappreciated bands on the planet, and Neil Finn's vocals are unique as they are beautiful. If you like complex melodies, great lyrics, and intense emotion, this disk is for you."
5,Another Excellent Album,"I admit I was a little nervous about hearing this album. Would it measure up to past releases? Simply put, yes, it does. Obviously, ""Don't Stop Now"" is a standout track but there are other gems as well like ""She Called Up"" and ""Silent House"". It's definitely a darker offering and I I like that they went there given what happened with Paul. It took me a few listens to appreciate some of the other songs but I think that's a sign of the collection's lasting impact. I still get chills from ""Don't Stop Now""."
1,"Sad, sad...","Don't buy this album. It's just too sad and not what CH are about. Instead, get their classic ones or even their new one."
5,Great Music...................,"Refreshing to hear interesting, well-crafted songs from these guys once again. I listen to alot of recordings, this one is definantly holding my attention."
4,All There Is to Know,"When this CD was released two years ago, I thought the title was a clever way to frame a greatest hits set; so I skipped over it. Later, I read some of the reviews here and snapped up a copy. There's some excellent work here. The opening track ""Nobody Wants To"" has a delicious pop melody, a snaking midtempo bridge and classic Finn vocals, ""Broken pieces on the ground, everyone's tip-toeing round."" ""She Called Up"" jumps out of the speaker with its boppy beat and delightful energy, ""Truth is a mortal blow, you know all there is to know, the hurt that you held so close, there's something better now."" ""Walked Her Way Down"" drives furiously after a few slow introductory bars with classic Crowded House hooks and unique melody. Other tracks on the set are also good such as the dense but moving ""Silent House"" and the McCartney-like ditty ""English Trees."" This is a good set. The 14 tracks offer a variety of tempos and different approaches that are well worth your time. Enjoy!"
3,A Bit Dull,"As a long time Crowded House fan I was anxious to listen to this disc. Sadly, I find it too slow, too long, and rather dull. After listening to it a number of times, the songs sound fine, but nothing sticks with you. The disc could have benefitted from some pruning, since at 14 tracks it outstays its welcome."
5,"It's not Together Alone, but CH is still better than anyone else.","This album takes some getting used to, and there are a few songs that aren't quite up to Crowded House's amazing calibre. Others are clearly more Neil Finn solo material (not a bad thing, just different). However, the songs that are amazing are, just that, AMAZING. I'd probably actually give this recording 4.5 stars, but that's not an option. ""Say That Again,"" ""Pour le Monde,"" and ""Transit Lounge"" are particular standouts. And anyone who got to see their recent tour witnessed how much more fantastic these songs were live. Crowded House is back! And I for one am thrilled. On tour they promised to be back in the studio by the end of the year, so there is only one more amazing music to come."
5,Very Good,"This is a real cool book and like the reviews I read before I bought it - the author backs up his claims. Certianly thought provoking and I believe this man is right!!! I Kindly Thank YouSincerely,Dennis B."
4,Anomalous Civilizations and Technology,"This book is an excellent overview of cryptozoology, ancient egypt, scientific conspiracy, ancient civilizations, anomalous technology, anomalous artifacts, ancient skeletons of giants and little people, human remnants alongside of dinosaur remnants, and a general overview of civilizations that have flourished before ours."
1,the worse l.a. guns album and the blame is phil lewis,"i'm sorry to write a crappy review of any record but this was an anticipated release and it's not worthy of the title. i love the guitar playing but the vocals actually cheapens the feeling of the original songs because phil sings like he's doing it to get it over with. buy the album and see for yourself. i hate to discourage anyone from supporting rock n' roll but please. do yourself a favor and buy ""shrinking violets"" instead. phil, what happened man?"
4,The original L.A. Guns re-record their greatest hits,"This is the first time the original band has been together since 1992. Six of the songs on this record are new tunes, six are re-recorded versions of songs from the first two albums, and the last two tracks are remixes. The band produced this record themselves and there is definitely a rough edge to the songs. The older songs sound like they were recorded in one take. Phil Lewis doesn't put as much energy in the songs as he did with the originals, but then again, he is ten years older. Tracii Guns and Steve Riley sound awesome as usual. And it's cool to hear Mick Cripps and Kelly Nickels again (what have they been up to lately?).This is a great rock and roll record. Just take it for what it is, and you won't be disappointed. Also, this is probably the only way you'll ever get a non-import greatest hits from L.A. Guns."
2,Not a cd worth losing Johnny Crypt over,"I was very disappointed to hear the contents of this album.The greatest hits tunes they remade are a far cry from the originals and only 2 or 3 of the newer tunes are listenable.I am a huge l.a.guns fan,but i dont understand why Tracci would put out an album this bad and lose such a cool and intregal part of the band like Johnny Crypt.And Phil Lewis should call it a career with the vocals he laid down on this album.He is god awful.A true guns fan will appreciate Tracci's guitar work,but that's as far as this cd will take you."
1,Not-so Greatest Hits,"File this one under - when good bands do bad things. L.A. Guns Greatest hits is re-recorded versions of prior hits, as well as a few forgettable b-side outtakes. Although tracks like No Mercy and Sex Action retain that live feel to them, the disc is completely undermined by a lackluster effort from singer Philip Lewis. A good singer when he wants to be, Lewis mails it in here big time to the point where he's almost talking the lyics.This is one of those discs that makes you real weary of any Cleopatra discs."
3,Missing Some Crucial Cuts,"I cannot fathom groups that continue to put out so-called ""Greatest Hits"" packages and then leave out important songs. Conspicuously absent from this compilation are the early-90's hits ""Never Enough"" and ""Over the Edge"" (and that was just my quick glance over the list). Can anyone tell me why? Thank God for itunes and Rhapsody, that way I can put together real ""Greatest Hits"" packages for all of these bands. I'd do a better job that the a-holes that they hire to put these things together. Maybe I can get on the payroll. Maybe a sandwich would be nice right about now. Hmmmm..."
3,Greatest Hits & Black Beauties,"Half of the previously unreleased songs are very good and half of the remakes from the first album are also good. Recorded in a slightly darker context from the first two albums with two fun remixes included at the end. However on the other 50% of the tracks Philips seems fused out. His vocals are much better on his solo album, Filthy Lucre & Liberators albums. It must be the sheer volume of touring and work for Cleopatra. From all reports Cocked & ReLoaded album is much the same.An average album from what is usually an excellent group of musicians. It may have worked better if it was recorded in the same way as Shrinking Violet."
2,He can do better.,"Those who were captivated by Kid 606's ""Down With The Scene"",beware - this is nowhere near as interesting or exciting. Essentially, it's two distinctly different musical concepts thrown onto one album. The first is a series of tracks where rather featureless synth washes are overlaid on some elementary and monumentally unchallenging drumbeats - it's all been done to death before. The second is a slightly more engrossing study in timbral shifts that recalls the avant garde of a few decades past. By the kid's well established standards, below par."
2,only good for spark plugs. hardly a grease,if you need to actually GREASE something that must be dielectric (insulated) this is NOT it.Very Thick. the drag on this grease is extremely high. It's pretty much silicone glue without the hardening agent.
5,Great for Motorcycles too,I bought this at a local automotive store when I needed to replace the lights on my Harley. I ride my Harley through all kinds of weather and the dielectric grease keeps the bulbs moisture free.This isn't just for cars and trucks. It can be used on any vehicle from cars to motorcycles to boats to ATVs.
5,Caution!,Caution this is not a conductive grease this is a sealant for electrical connections. I was looking for NOALOX conductive grease when I typed it in the Amazon search it brought me to this item not the same this product would be ideal for sealing battery terminals after the connection is made if you are looking for Noalox Lowes has it in stock.
4,Muito bom produto,"Já utilizei e funcionou muito bem nas bobinas do meu jet ski, impedindo a entrada da água salgada. Vale muito a pena!"
4,Good little camera for the money,"I installed this outside, to monitor my front door. Works great so far. Not really using it for long-range video, just about 12 feet or so. The night vision works pretty well at that distance. During the day I get a nice color image with a fast frame rate. The long cable was nice too. Don't really use the microphone, so I can't comment on the quality of the mic, but it definately works. I think this is probably about as good as you're gonna get for color, outdoor camera with night vision and sound for under $50 w/shipping included. If you don't need the microphone, I would say go with the SVAT CV65SVAT CV65 Outdoor Nightvision Security Camera (Color). I have one of these too, the field of view is just a little bit narrower, but I think the picture is better."
1,book not completely factual,"book, cute story but not really typical of first settlers in Oklahoma.. Not completely factual as to governing bodies in place in 1889."
5,Quality and Excellent Value,Of the DVD-RAM discs I have used over the years these have to be the best in quality and longevity. I use these mainly with a Panasonic DVD recorder to record various TV programs for viewing at a later time and have to say they hold up very well to the constant recording and deleting. I highly recommend these DVD-RAM discs for value and quality. I was glad to find them available on amazon as it has become near impossible to find them in retail stores and harder to find them for a great price online.
4,The discs are the best DVD-RAMs,They work great in Panasonic DVD recorders and on PCs. The only thing I do not like is the slim case. Really annoying. Too thin and no spine to write what's on it. I end up with a bunch DVDs that I don't what's on them without going through them. Panasonic's DVD-Rs are excellent also. I don't mind paying extra for good quality.
5,who knew about DVD ram?,"With a new Panasonic dvd player, EZ17K, I had not been using dvd ram until I spoke with a tech at Panasonic. Wow, what a difference! No need to format and waste time and easy to erase recorded programs. I am hooked and enjoy thoroughly recording my favorite shows. Highly recommend this product from the seller."
3,DVD-RAMS are not always compatible with ALL DVD Recorders!,"This product does work, however, it is not compatible with my Toshiba DVD Recorder.It will PLAY BACK a recording made by my other DVD Recorder, an LG model, but can't make recordings on DVD RAMS. If I had known about this before purchase, I'd have bought DVD+RW discs, which can be used by both recorders."
5,Good Media,This meia works great with my panasonic recorder. I use the disks over and over without any gliches. Solid performance.I wold highly recommend them.
2,5 instead of 10,"These are good disks, but I was under the impression that I was ordering 10 disks, not 5. Perhaps my error."
5,Panasonic DVD -RAM discs.,If your recorder will record to the RAM disc you will have a lot more versatility in editing etc with Ram then you do on the R or RW discs. You can also reformat and rerecord on them thousands of times. I have several pieces of Panasonic equipment and have had excellent service out of all of them.Panasonic does not skimp on quality which is why I bought the Panasonic brand of DVD Ram discs.
5,Burn Proof,"For those not in the know the difference between a DVD-RW (ReWriteable) disk and a DVD-Ram disk is that:A ReWritable disk can be burned, erased and rewrote to about 1000 times.A DVD-Ram disk can be burned, erased and rewrote to about 100,000 times.The catch is to do this you have to have a DVD-Ram capable drive or they will not read or write to the DVD-Ram disk.I have burned 1 of these disk out of the 10 pack so far and it burned and erased properly."
5,Excellant DVD RAMs,"I know these DVD RAMs cost more that the regular DVDs, but these last longer and are more reliable. I like them!!"
4,"Good product, but not very cheap!",I really enjoy the DVD-RAM format. It seems to read a lot quicker than -RW/+RW and offers an easier method of erasing all titles to start anew. I just wish they would come down in price to be comparative with the other types of discs. Their cost makes me think twice before spending the money.
1,Unreliable,"Of the 5 DVD-RAMs I received, two were un-readable by my DVD Recorder. One more disk was readable but the second time we tried to view the contents our recorder said it too was un-readable. This is the second order I've made for Panasonic DVD-RAMs. The first set work perfectly but have no hard coating on the top layer - this set (with hard coating) are un-reliable to say the least."
1,Unreadable,I've got the whole box of unreadable DVDs! I bought them before and had no problem using in my Panasonic DVD recorder. These ones are not working! It doesn't recognize them and cannot format them.
1,Disappointed with Panasonic,"I've been using these with my Panasonic DVD recorder and the performance has been very poor. When I set a timed recording there is good chance that the recorder will delete the scheduled request and there will be nothing recorded on the disk. I don't know whether it is the recorder or the disk, but it seems to be getting worse with time. Maybe the disks are worn out? I know that I have not used them 10,000 times. Reformatting doesn't help. I am very disappointed with Panasonic and have lost the brand loyalty that I had to them for so many years."
3,good product,I was very pleased with this product and it was perfect for what I needed. I was very disappointed in the length it took to ship considering it was staying in the same state. It did ship within the quoted time frame however I really expected to get it sooner.
5,Funciona perfectamente en Panasonic DVD Recorder,"Con todas las ventajas del DVD-RAM, es la mejor opción para grabar y reproducir películas en un TV de plasma 42"". Sólo los DVD+RW resultan la opción apropiada cuando quiero ver las grabaciones en otros dvd player o para editarlas en mi PC."
1,You Need To Upgrade or Update,Imagine my surprize when I ordered this item after looking at a ten-pack and receiving a 5-pack. But in small writing it said the item came in just a 5-pack package. But there was more confusion. The design color and picture used to display and indicate this item was not the same as the one I received when my shipment arrived. Instead my packaging was various shades of blue with all of the information in different locations. Needless to say I wasted about and hour before I was finally satisfied that I got what I paid for. Which could have been eliminated with a little review by whomever is your product monitor.
2,panasonic bad,I've had the Panasonic DVD recorder for precisely two year and even with the extra warranty it has now stopped working. The DVDs are fine but recorder is shabby.
5,Defenders never die,"Voltron, a classic anime series that spawned the anime craze here in America. A cult classic, far from being just for kids, this mecha is the original in my eyes, no bad wanna be (power rangers/zoids)could ever compare. Definately worth picking up all the series."
4,A Worthy Addition,"In all seriousness this particular disc is worth it.It is a mighty short program and some of it misses the mark, but when it does hit its a clean, clear and strong shot.'We Control The Dice' is in the same league as the best of Rakim lyric-wise and the beats\music is on point too.Sometimes ""Music Madness"" does tend to lean toward house and techno but don't let that deter you.If you can dig 'Hardcore HipHop' from their first release then you shouldn't have any problems with this.My only complaint is that there aren't ANY extra (bonus) cuts and no info at all is included with the booklet.This is a re-release in the strictest sense, get it while its still available."
5,The man does it all!,"I am a big fan of Rod Stewart. This collection of his songs is an excellent choice. I especially enjoyed the song THE MOTOWN SONG. The entire DVD will keep your attention and you will want to view it over and over. Hope they decide to release other ones of him, as there are a lot more songs that I would love to see on a DVD."
5,Hail to the Rod!,"This video is essential for any self-proclaimed rabid Rod Stewart fan. The songs are selected from his very best works, and the videos are all very high-quality, not just a bunch of explosions strung together to grab attention like most of today's music videos. Buy it! Buy it NOW!"
3,a bit mixed!,SAD this dvd doesnt have more of his top hits...babyjane etc...BUT the only two songs i like are Motown song and Isley brother's hit this old heart of mine... the other songs seem to be a bit on the slow side... but im sure rods fans would say different!
3,Not Enough Street Skating!,"This a good video to watch at maybe a friends house, but not to buy. In the beginning of it, they have a lot of previews for movies and stuff not related at all to skateboarding. it takes up a good twenty minutes of the video. but once it get's going it's alright. there's a lot of vert skating, which is kind of a bummer, because i was hoping to see more street skating which is more exciting. the downhill skateboarding is pretty cool, but it gets kinda boring after a while. they only show a brief minute long video which consists of a ton of different clips for street.if you got 14 bucks to burn, i'd suggest you put it towards a different video, unless you only want to see vert skating, and downhill."
5,A Vert Feast - If you want vert get it now!,"I'm a vert fan and this is by far the best vert ramp coverage I have seen in ages, it could have shown a few more riders, but it was still awesome. I'm sick of all the street stuff, for all you streeters out there you probably will hate this. For those of you like me who have skated vert and know how gnarly this stuff really is, you will love it. Don't think twice if you like vert just get it."
4,Awesome,This video was really neat. it mixes good music with the best skaters in the world. My favorite part of the video is the downhill skateboarding. This video can be enjoyed by beginners and experts alike. The vert skating does get a little boring after a while though.
3,Good Mix,"This skate vid has a good mix of tricks, narly and tech, although there could be more huge tricks to add an element of shock to the video."
4,"very nice book, worthy sort of sequel","This book picks up where volume 1 left off, and is very similar to volume 1: if you like the first one (as I do), you'll like the second one at least as much. The songs do indeed get steadily more intricate and so sort of harder, but then that's more or less what I want from my practicing. My only complaint is that the songs often spread out onto several pages: I'm terrible at page turning, and so end up making copies of the odd pages. Even so, I'm very happy with this book. I get a lot of good practice time out of it, and might well end up memorizing a few songs from it."
3,Cute But Way Too Pricey,"My daughter wanted this for her recital gift this year for ballet. She loves Peppa Pig and so this reminded her of Peppa (even though this is from Toot and Puddle). The toy is cute, but I think it should be priced more around $15. She loved it though, and that's all that matters. I had a hard time finding measurements on this one when I was ordering. Its around 11"" tall. The costume is cute, but again, not really worth $25. Didn't find it cheaper anywhere else though."
3,From trite to terrific,The quotations in the book encompass a gamut of variances. From those so profound you have to read them twice to those that you groan at and wonder what possessed the editor to add them. Overall the book is worth the money... all 80 cents.
3,Nothing Special Here,"This is a workmanlike collection of quotations on friendship, something that one could put together from internet sources in about two days. Most of the quotations are uninteresting, far too many are from (old) poetry.I was specifically looking for ""One friend in a lifetime is much, two are many, three are hardly possible,"" which I have always thought came from the ancient Greeks, and have been looking for sporadically without success. Turns out to be from ""The Education of Henry Adams,"" a book I read years ago. The mind plays tricks."
5,Brother shipping label DK-1202,"Shipping label for Brother label printer model QL-550 works like it is designed to. Load, print, cut, peel and stick. No problems encountered useing shipping label roll in label printer.The label roll only fits one way in the label printer, is easy to load and set up for printing."
5,Lives up to my expectations,I bought these labels to use for my business. They work great in the Brother label printer and are exactly what I needed.
4,Very Capable Label Printer,"The choices of labels are a bit pedestrian, hence the 4 stars instead of 5, but otherwise it's just right. It has a small footprint and fits easily on your desk. The labels look great and print fast. We use it on a Mac with no problem. You'll like it if you get it."
1,THIS IS NOT AUTOMATIC LOVELETTER,"If you are wanting a CD or download of Automatic Loveletter or thinking that this is music from Juliet Simms, IT IS NOT. THIS IS NOT AUTOMATIC LOVELETTER. It is a UK band called ""The Automatic"" and there are two songs on this CD. It has NOTHING to do with Automatic Loveletter so please do not be fooled. I bought this CD in good faith thinking it was Automatic Loveletter because I love, love, love Juliet Simms and the seller, eurodream25, emailed me when I wanted a refund the following:""Was artwork matching the one shown on Amazon? How about track listing?To my knowledge all this was correct."" Yes the artwork matched and the track listing, but irregardless, it was NOT Automatic Loveletter. Amazon refunded the money. SO BUYER PLEASE PLEASE BEWARE!!"
1,This is supposed to be educational?,"Galileo Smith must be the single worst video I've ever seen about the solar system geared towards kids. The story line made virtually no sense, and the acting didn't help at all either. But there are some decent solar system videos with really awful acting and plot, and this isn't one of them. In one embarassing scene, two of the kids (boy and girl) started dancing together after Galileo Smith said that Pluto and Charon were in a dance. Nothing was said about gravity or mass or any other useful physics concept, they just started doing a pop dance and it went on and on with no further explanation. Seriously, this is one dumb video. I have to wonder about the quote on the back of the box from an ""assistant teacher"" and whether it was real, or just another bogus quote like the movie studios use for expensive movies."
5,air conditionning compressor,This air conditionning is exactly what I was expecting.The description on the Amazon site is perfect and I will not hesitate to buy again.Thanks
2,Not great for neuro course,"This book is grossly inadequate for a neuroantomy medical course. It's probably best if used as a review for USMLE 1. Decent diagrams with some errors, especially in the vision chapter."
5,Prefer this over BRS to study and review,"Found this book very helpful, I found that I couldn't study Neuro from BRS, I thought this book was much better. Otherwise I use and like the BRS series frequently."
5,Expensive but excellent.,"I never thought I'd pay $2.50 for the same amount of liquid that's in a regular can of soda, but this is worth it. It has a classic taste to it, with the bottle and the real sugar, a perfect level of tartness, sweet but not too sweet."
4,My toddler loves this book!,"I stumbled across this book when searching for books to help teach my toddler sign language. He loves it and brings it to me nearly every day wanting me to read it to him and talk about the colorful pictures. Toddlers will be drawn to this sturdy board book because of the brightly colored pictures of familiar objects such as socks, crackers, and shoes. Parents will find the simple line drawings of the different signs helpful in teaching their children some basic signs. This book is a good introduction to sign language for both hearing and deaf children."
3,Not my favorite baby sign language book,"Just didn't spark my 1 yr old's interest as much as other signing books. She was really into signing at 8 months, talking before a year and now at 2.5 yrs speaks in full, grammatically correct sentences using big words. Books, especially about signs, really peaked her interest, but not this one for some reason."
3,"Great flexibility, stays cold 6 hours","This ice mat is great for folding around the items in my cooler, but it doesn't stay cold as long as my bulky blue ice pack. By the end of the work day, it's still cool (after sitting in my car in the parking garage all day in Texas), but not cold. If you need something that stays cold longer, I would sacrifice flexibility for coldness and get one with fewer ice pockets. I use it daily (for about 6 weeks so far) and have had no problems with tears or leaking."
3,"Good, but not amazing","I thought this would be more malleable. From its description, it seemed like it would be more gel-like, not just like ice cubes held together by a big piece of material. Nonetheless, it does have more flexibility than a typical ice pack.(I'm using it to reduce swelling on a hand injury, not to keep food cold)"
3,"A decent product, not great.","This product is good. It COULD be great. If it were easier to cut and r-size the product, it would be great. I attempted to cut the product so it was a better fit for my lunch box, and I ended up ruining about half of the squares. Not because I went on a drunken cutting spree with the scissors, the way that the water-filled squares are sealed is kind of uneven and VERY difficult to cut without causing at least minor leaks in many of the squares.On the plus side, my favorite thing about the ice being separated into squares is that it makes it flexible. When I cut my mat down (and sacrificed several squares to do so) I had a small section of squares that I could wrap around a can of soda pop, with the assistance of a rubber band. The drink was ice-cold at lunch time when I did this.I probably wouldn't buy these again. I would just buy an icepack that was already the size i need. All in all, this icepack just a few steps above water in a zipper baggie."
5,Keeps you cool when It's hot outside.,"I own a lawn service business and use these in a pouch and wear it around my neck. I use one whole Icy Cool Reusable Mat and It will last about 2 hours. So I carry extras to last the whole day, makes my day easier cutting grass in this Florida heat."
5,Stays cold,"Stays cold the longest I've ever seen. Has a great ability to ""form"" around items right out of the freezer."
2,absence of science,"I bought this book after reviewing some comments here on Amazon. Since I am interested in both the physiology behind training and training itself, this seemed a good choice. I thought that if it could be criticized it would be on the account of too much information rather than too little. Unfortunately, I now think otherwise. It has barely covered the basics in how to put together a plan based on the athlete's specific needs."
5,Excellent Coverage,"The amount covered in the book and the quality in which it was presented is absolutely the highest of positive adjectives. I recommend this book for those in search of a Triathlon Training instruction book, whether you're new to the sport or a veteran of any level. The bases are hit very well, the main points drawn on with accurate, relavent detail. Get this book."
2,disappointing for beginner,"I had read all the rave reviews so was disappointed by my own experience. I am a new-comer to multisport competition. I found this book to be too much theory and not enough practicality; what was practical was presented in an incohesive way. I could see this being good for the serious triathlete, but for me, I found better use out of Eric Harr's book and on the internet."
5,Great for Intermediate/Advanced triathletes,"I am an exercise scientist, and triathlete, and this is the best book on periodizing triathlon workouts that I have come across. It is very detailed, so is more geared toward intermediate to advanced athletes. If you are looking for good strength training workouts, though, this book does not have that. The strength training in here is very generic, not tri specific."
3,Not for the Beginner Triathlete,"I have been doing triathlons for three years and I feel this book is not for the Beginner Triathlete. This book reads like a College Text Book and is appropriate for the seasoned triathlete as it has invaluable technical data. I do not recommend this book for the beginner triathlete because I feel that it does Not address the mental and psychological aspects of doing a triathlon. Both of which I feel are extremely important hurdles for people to overcome when entering mutisports races. I recommend ""Triathlon 101"" by John Mora for beginning triathletes."
2,"Nothing to inspire you, quite boring.","I bought this book because it was highly rated and expected it to be a ""bible"" of triathlon. Instead it mainly focuses on how to cycle your training years and how to manage your time according to your goals. The chapter on technique and equipment is only very brief and superficial, Friel merely points out that you should get some swimming lessons to learn to swim faster, and maybe buy fancier equipment to cycle faster. The psychological side is also quite thin, and there just isn`t anykind of personal touch in the book. I really don`t feel like opening it again. In endurance sports you must have that ""inner-burning"" to keep you going, and quite frankly, Friel gives the feeling of an arm-chair theoretician of himself in this book."
5,Awesome book!,This is amazing book for any triathlete. It has everything you are looking for and goes into great depth about improving your body/time.I highly recommend this book.
1,Master Visually Microsoft Windows Vista,"It is impossible to read the picture shots of the Windows without using a magnifying glass. No help ""Visually""."
1,Not too happy!,I have purchased Master Visually books on other computer programs in the past. This one was very disappointing. It didn't give me the information I was looking for. I ended up purchasing a Dummies Book by Woody Leonhard which gave me exactly what I wanted. I would not recommend purchasing book.
1,Awful!,"This video looks like it was filmed during the 1950s. It is really blurry and you can barely make out the furry creatures on this DVD. I thought it was a quality DVD recording, but it looks so cheap, like someone spliced an educational film from the 1950s and put it on this DVD.Do NOT buy this unless you like wasting money."
2,"poor print quality, skip if you are picky","its a decent poster but the color printing isn't top notch, especially on charlie's face. not a huge deal but if you are picky, you will hate it, his face is pixelated and striped, rather than solid beige."
5,Excellent!,"Crisp, concise and to the point, clearly and ably written, and extremely informative. I wish I'd discovered it much earlier. If you want to understand when, why and how science works best, the discussion in this remarkably timeless book is the place to start."
1,Alfonso Ruiz,"sorry, I dont write good inglish and i dont kwon other way to contac you, so i will write here. I pay for the laptop and when the company tray to give me the pack I never be at home. Can you please make the travel again. Thank and sorry"
1,Very disappointed....save your money!,"I purchased the Toshiba M55-s331 and loved it for it's true bright screen which is awesome! Within one day it was freezing up every 2 hours. I've only had it for three days and will be returning it to BestBuy tomorrow! Don't waste your money! I've had a Sony Vaio VGN-S150 for almost 2 years and have never had one problem with it and their customer service is awesome!Also, Internet Explorer keeps crashing, software doesn't load completely....it's a mess! I wish I would've read the reviews about Toshiba Satelite's before going and purchasing one! Sony's may cost more, but they're worth every penny.I'll never buy a Toshiba again!"
2,Detailed and boring,"Very, very detailed.Also very boring and hard to read.Full of names most people have never heard of and lots of dates.Not as entertaining as the biographies and autobiographies I have read about Cash.No real insight into the kind of person he was or what made him tick."
1,BEWARE - THIS TOY SHOULD BE RECALLED,This toy has a wire frame which after a time came loose and apart and could be dangerous to your pet.
1,"Fun toy, but has dangerous plastic insert","We've purchased a number of kyjen ""hide-a..."" toys and our golden retriever puppy loves them all. He loves this one too, but we had to take it away because he chewed it up a bit (normal for all the toys) and inside was a long flat plastic insert along the base of the toy. I haven't seen this in any of the other kyjen toys. I assume it's there to hold the shape of the bird house. I know many of the toys have plastic squeekers that the dog shouldn't be chewing on, but this plastic seems worse to me and feels completely unsafe... It's very hard but can be chewed apart (like rawhide) leaving your dog with hard chunks of plastic stuck in his throat. Luckily I caught it before our dog got into too much of it, and he was able to cough up the little piece he was eating. Because of this unnecessary piece of plastic sewn into the toy I would not recommend the purchase of the hide-a-bird toy."
3,Did not last.,"My two dogs loved this toy. You can use the bird house even after the birds have been chewed up. Just shove other toys inside and the dogs had just as much fun getting them out. My main complaint is that the birds did not last at all. Willow, a springer spaniel, had it chewed up the moment we looked away. There was stuffing everywhere within an hour or two. I am interested to try the other ones since it did entertain them for a little while (squirl or bee) to see if either of those are not destroyed."
2,Not what I expected.,"My shih tzu wasn't too interested in the birds in the house. She likes the birds alone. Or if I put treats in the house, she goes for the house. But she doesn't play with the toy as I anticipated she would. I was slightly disappointed considering all the rave reviews and the high price tag.I like that it's all washable. Unfortunately, one of the birds heads is already falling off - before I even needed to wash it."
5,Boxers love it,"My big boxers take the birds out 1 at a time, so gently. They love it. Soft, plush toys. Three birds in a house."
2,Fun until it gets ripped up!,"I would have given this more stars IF it had lasted longer. My dog is only 10 pounds but loves to chew...don't they all? She had a lot of fun with this and loved me putting the birds back in the house and her working to get them out. But after having it for not even a month, she got to the inside and began tearing out the bottom (cardboard I think) and I saw her eating little pieces. I had to throw it away. I can usually sew up things she chews a hole in, but I couldn't fix this one. So, if your dog is a big chewer, this won't last too long and almost $15 is way too much to pay for a short-term toy. She has toys I only paid a couple of dollars for that she's had since she was a pup....she's almost 1-1/2 years now."
1,Horribly made,"I have 8-pound mini-Maltese/Poodle puppy. I was thrilled to see that she loved this toy and had a great time digging the birdies out. BUT, within 5 minutes we noticed a tear on one of the birds. We figured it may have come like that since we've never had issues with tearing and all of her toys have held up for at least a year and a half. Every single toy we bought her when we brought her home is still in tact. The next day, we were playing with the toys and noticed that one of the birds had completely fallen apart. Honestly, I don't understand how a dog toy company can make its products like this. How does this toy hold up with larger dogs if an 8-pound puppy can rip it apart within a day?"
2,Seiko Watch,Seiko Mens WatchI am not satisfied with the watch.I thought the crystal had a date but it does not.The band is very cheap. I was going to exchange it but did not wish to encounter a cost for shipping and return fees.
4,Better than I expected,"A friend loaned me this book, and told me I'd enjoy it despite my past disappointment with authors from small publishers. And she was right! Turner writes an intriguing story that kept me interested from start to finish, and the romance was terrific. Strong sexual tension, nice insight into the characters thoughts and feelings, and a well-crafted ending. I will definitely keep an eye out for more from this author in the future."
1,Horrible Read,I couldn't even finish the book it was that bad. I've never come across a birth book where the author seemed to know so little about the natural birth process.
