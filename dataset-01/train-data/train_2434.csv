5,This book changed my life.,I have never read or heard Islam captured so beautifully as it is here--this book addresses so many issues and questions I have had about my own religion. I feel like I have discovered something that was lost. I thank Khaled Abou El Fadl for this treasure.
5,Nourishing Life Enhancing Food & Drink for the Hungry Soul,"This book is for those who possess an introspective and craving soul. It is for those who take seriously the notion that Islam is the path to peace through submission to the Divine will. It is for those who find their spirits burdened by contradictions, misinterpretations, and stagnant thought, which give birth to other oppressive forces such as but not limited to: indiscriminate warfare, sexism, racism, elitism, nationalism, classism, and intellectual chauvinism.It is for those who have tired of a diet replete with spiritual baby food and adulterated water. They will find spiritual fiber, and will be refreshed with cool and palatable water. They will find this book thought provoking, affirming, inspiring, fortifying, and illuminating. They will be moved to tears of joy. They will come to understand that the author's search and struggle is indeed their own."
5,"Beautifully Inspired, Humbling, and Courageous","No book on Islam or Muslims compares to this courageously insightful work on Islamic morality, contemporary Islam, and Muslim society. Its poetic flair, prosaic brilliance, and heart wrenching realism leaves the reader awestruck by the penetrating insight of an expert on Islam who clearly cares about the Islamic tradition and is unwilling to tolerate the spritual and intellectual atrophy of one of this world's greatest civilizations. Far from apologetic, Abou El Fadl tackles the controversial issues of the day and shows that within the Islamic tradition are answers and ideas that are truly inspirational and beautiful. A must-read for anyone who cares about Islam and Muslim society, or who cares to know about Islam and Muslim society. This is the kind of book that you will want to read over and over again."
1,"Great service, worthless product.","These are worthless seeds. They quickly shipped and I planted them per directions in the spring, but not a single one aprouted-- and I have two varieties of volunteers. The seller doesn't support the product either."
3,Nice music but disappointing video choices,"I bought this Naxos DVD musical traveloque of France, with music of Faure, as an introduction to this series. I was disappointed. Granted, the Faure music is great, and there are some nice vistas of the countryside and cathedrals, but with all the visually interesting scenery available in France, why the long study of highways, fields, canals and boats?! PLEASE - how more interior shots of the churches! If only Rick Steves had provided the video instead of Mom and Pop tourist. The last section dwelt too long on a boatman navigating a lake. Better to buy a good travel of France or cathedrals, and put on a CD of music as you watch.See also my review of the Naxos traveloque of Switzerland, with music of Schubert."
3,Sad,"This is a typical Naxos disk. I was hoping for more variety in the scenery. The music is all rather sad. Some variety in the musical selections would have helped. As usual I wish Naxos would tell us what we are looking at while we are seeing it.Still with all of that, it does have some interesting shots of Cathedrals and Tapestries that I've never seen before."
2,Avoid avoid avoid!!,"Don't be taken in by the blurb on the box or the screenshots. Yes, some of the screens look nice, but that's as far it goes. The game begins promisingly - you think you're in for a great third person adventure a la Longest Journey. You're not. The gameplay, story and acting are singularly terrible. There are tons of characters you can't interact with, the dialogue is moronic, and there are cliches everywhere. Sometimes it's impossible to know where you're meant to go, and the interminably dreary to-ing and fro-ing from the apartment to the taxi to the office is life-threateningly boring. This game managed to garner some good reviews here and there. Why? It's the kind of thing that shouldn't be on the market, and the reason why adventure game fans are so often disappointed. Go for: Still Life, Runaway, Syberia, Longest Journey, Grim Fandango, Amerzone, Black Mirror. Avoid: This, Legacy: Dark Shadows, Dark Fall, Gooka."
2,house of tales bungles again,"yes these are the guys responsible for that appalling druids game that came out a few years ago (avoid at all costs). This time they actually came out with a 4 star level game except...it crashed halfway through (the prison scene for who is playing the game) and there is no way out.Judging by the forums quite a few people are experiencing the same problem. I tried reinstalling the game and using savegames from hepful fellow players but to no avail. The support level is appalling (no contact on the HP!).This is the last game I buy from these guys, perhaps you should think twice before buying the mos"
5,nickel knobs,"I love these knobs! We purchased a bunch 2 years ago when we finished decorating the bedrooms,when we re-did the whole downstairs the knobs were almost impossible to find .We found them and they matched the upstairs perfectly.We are very pleased with our purchase."
5,I got mine as a Christmas present,"It looks great, so that's the basis of the five stars. Well, that and the fact that the glass tube arrived unbroken. Whew!Now all I need is some rain. I'd like to make a trade with someone in north-central California: Send us some of your rain and I'll send you some San Antonio sunshine!"
1,I have a request,"I will rate this a 5 if I am able to replace the glass tube for the rain gauge. Mine broke, and if I cannot replace the glass tube, then the entire piece has far less value -- right now no value."
3,over priced,"a nice start up kit , the only part that is really worth it is the lesser weight hammer. i can really hammer like the pros now!"
2,still pretty yellow...,"Being turned on to the idea of artificial lights emulating the sun, I thought I'd try some bulbs. I got these, as they were cheaper, and they were just that. Perhaps they filter out some yellow, but my walls are still glowing yellow with these lights. If you really want a full spectrum light, you should look elsewhere. Look for products that have a CRI rating over 90 (100 is sunlight). I couldn't find a rating for this product, which probably means it really hasn't been rated for full spectrum... perhaps I'm wrong and just couldn't find it... just make sure you look it up."
3,Uneven performance...,"Right from the start I must inform you that I play on this record, but I don't think that makes me biased.... The highlight of the album must be Hkan Bj√∂rkman's stylish performance of the Graundahl trombone concerto. Wonderful playing. For those of you that don't know Sallinen's ""Chorali"", the record is worth buying just to hear this masterpiece. Otherwise both the playing and Hirokami's interpretations leave something to be desired."
4,Great Home Video Editor,"I have uses many other video editors in the past and this one by adobe is by far the best that I have used. This is truly the step up from anything that is our there. The big hassel I have had in the past is moving all my elements after I have made a cut or edit. This is pain because of all the time it takes. Premiere takes the trouble away by auto adjusting your elements when a edit is made. For picky people that function rocks!Elements are quickly loaded and easy to use. I am not happy that some Mpeg video will not load due to the Premieres decompression function, but you can't have everythingGood product. Just make sure your cpu is up to speed"
2,Performance is terrible on a computer that exceeds the specs,"While I'm sure I would love using this software, if you have a machine that only meets the specs (P4 processor + 256 mb of RAM) I have a hard time that it would even be usable. I have a P4 and 1 gig of RAM and it is terrible ~ nearly unusable. I think their minimum specs are very wrong."
3,Buy the New upgrade,"Started with this software but the new upgrade ( Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 and Premier 4) are vastly superior. Go for the new upgrade, it's great and far superior to his version."
4,Very good video editing software,"First of all, I have tried many other editing programs before buying this one.I tried Sony Vegas, Pinnacle 10 plus (a disaster), Pinnacle 9, and Windows Movie maker 2.1.By far this is the best program for video editing I have seen.Most importantly, it works! No crashing like Pinnacle 10.It has a helpful manual and many books and websites dedicated to it.Video capture works well and has a nice scene detect function (which most programs have now).The editing tool is very powerful and the video are effects are more than you could ever need.Cons:1. DVD menu's and DVD customization seems very limited. You can only have a 29 second music track for your title and menu screen.You must own Photoshop to make custom DVD menus.2. You can't transfer movie clips between projects.3. It is slightly complex for the average user. The free Windows movie maker is more intuitive but it can't burn DVD's.Overall, it's a very good program but still have room for improvement."
2,Probably great but won't install on many systems,Be very careful that your system meets the requirements before you purchase this software. If your computer doesn't support SSE2 (do you even know what that is? I didn't) it just won't install. Unfortunately all three of my PCs have AMD XP chipsets so this software won't work.The packaging isn't helpful unless you know for sure if your computer supports SSE2.It seems like a problem that Adobe woudl put out a piece of commercial software that won't install on some very popular computers.
2,Adobe Premier Elements 2.0,This software is garbage. One problem after another. The Program CD wouldn't load. The capture doesn't word. The editing was OK. The burning doesn't work. Help from Adobe consisted of use Windows movie Maker to capture. Changed software to Ulead No problems.
3,This is PAL not NTSC as advertised,"Historical monochrome vhs to DVD conversion. Very grainy poor quality. It is however ""not to miss"" for karate enthusiasts whose practice goes back to these big names in Shotokan.My copy came as a PAL dvd and not NTSC as advertised. Luckily in my dojo I have a DVD player that plays both!"
3,"Good, but less than seasons 1 & 3","Season 2 lacks some of the artistry found in season one, though it has inspired moments. ""Earthmover"" is a fantastic episode, and the music in ""Sentries of the Last Cosmos"" is awesome."
2,damage goods,"First, the art and storyline of Batman Beyond: Season Season, were excellent. Then, why did I gave this edition a two star rating? Disc No. One was damage. I have to obtained another edition of Batman Beyond: Season Season. This time Disc No. One was ""reasonabley"" functional. The odd thing about it, the spot where the ""damage"" seem to be zeroed in on both discs falls on the episode ""Lost Soul"" and continue on to the next two episodes. Second thought occurred: why is the second season edition is sold much more cheaply than the others, since it has much more episodes? Take all the above in consideration, one is forced to wonder."
4,Terry going hard,"Very entertaining, alot of futuristic settings and technology. Great for Batman fans who want to know the aftermath of Bruce Wayne's retirement.Enjoyed the first two disc and still have two more to go."
5,Batman Beyond Season 2,"When this was airing on TV I thought it was just some cheap remake of batman for kids and I never even bothered to watch one episode of it. After all of these years and its out on DVD I decided to give this show a try and it was actually pretty amazing. I may have ended up liking it more than the original batman the animated series show.I would definately recommend this to someone who was a fan of the original batman if your wishing to see how Bruce finds a successor and someone to continue as batman while bruce teaches and coaches from afar. This is definately a show for your kids to enjoy as well. Its not just a random crappy cartoon show, its actually pretty good if you dont mind a bit of fighting violence to be watched by your kids."
2,The packaging is just awful,"The cardboard is all mangled, due to a poor manufacturing process. Also the glue holding the plastic to the cardboard is drying up, causing the two to split apart. I just got this today, and now I have to get some cases to put the discs in. I can't keep it in the original case, because it's complete garbage!"
3,The best is yet to come,"During the second season of Batman Beyond, the show crew develope the characters they created along Season One. The result is a full-action packed series, a great entertainment and one or two memorable episodes (for instance April Moon, maybe one of the best stories I've seen in a TV animation series).If you liked season one, buy this second season. However, if you are thinking about it, have in mind that the thriteen episodes of thethird season are really really good (in fact, of compulsory view if you are a Bat-fan) and maybe you will regret not having the whole series..."
5,Holy Batsmoke Batman!,"Im a big Batman fan and Batman Beyond is a great series. Although Im partial to Bruce Wayan being batman, Terry is a good replacement. If your a batman fan pick'em up."
5,Batman Beyond-Season Two........,"Following its' success with Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, WB gave us Batman Beyond. Taking place some 50 years in the future, Bruce Wayne passes on the mantle of Batman to Terry McGinnis who tries his best to balance his nightlife with his lovelife and high school. All 26 episodes of season two are spread out over four discs. Extras include commentary from cast and crew as well as a 12-minute featurette called ""Inside Batman Beyond: The Panel,"" featuring interviews with producers Bruce Timm, Alan Burnett, Glen Murakami, and Paul Dini. Also, a gallery of trailers for other Warner Home Video animated releases complete Disc 4. While I'll admit, it is slim pickins'..it is still welcome. Any extras are always welcome in this day and age on DVD as most DVDs don't include extras anymore. At any rate, Season 2 is great. I recommend it to all Batman fans and animation buffs everywhere. This is a great show."
1,"Nearly ""Content Free""","No depth at all. Really lame. There are many much better options. For example, get a DVD by Jacques Pepin or Julia Child -- these have 10,000 times more content than this item. And its style reminds me of a WWII vintage military training film. Computerwise, it is behind the times by 20 years. A total waste of my money."
3,Netware 5.1,"This book is totally useless without the reader being told how to install the server first, so that the reader can then use the labs from the book. As it stands, the reader has to go to a school or get help from somebody else in setting up the server. There is no software enclosed, not even novell's demo kit which can be had ...that includes a 3 user license copy of the server and the workstation client. There is also no student disk that has the necessary data to perform the labs, and a textbook errata that one has to get from the course technology site. The book doesn't explain the material well in some sections and the same thing can be said for the lab instructions. This book in conjunction with its sister book network administration 5.0/5.1, need a revision upgrade ASAP."
2,Pretty Good Satruday Night DVD,"Pretty good material here with Michael Pare of 'Eddie and the Cruisers' and a few other familiar faces. Better than the campy, no-name horror films, but not in the category of some of the better ones"
3,DArkly entertaining,The actual scenery here is very dark as they are in the bowels of a prison. Decent story line. The acting is good enough and it is suspenseful. I don't think it is really that entertaining nor that scary but it is not horribly bloody either so its worth giving it a viewing. Wouldn't spend a whole lot of money on it.
4,Good well acted horror movie,"The first thing I thought was JA-RULE acting in a horror! This should be funny! But he did and outstanding job! His acting and the rest of the cast was superb! I highly reccomend this movie. There was just one part that made me say WTF! why did they put that in! When the live man fights a ghost come on! I dont want to ruin the movie. Watch it! Only reason its not 5 stars is because it left me wanting even more, but its good from start to finish."
2,Furnace cools down pretty quickly,"I bought this film..and really really wanted to love it. I love Tom Seizemore..and Danny Trejo is simply a modern cult star. It starts out very good with interesting character development and pretty eerie setting. Though the horror aspect of this film is derivative of much better films like the Ring, and the elm street series..it does try to put it's own signature on it. The movie was entertaining enough to keep me interested...however when the credits rolled I was ultimately disappointed as in my opinion poor writing made the flick fall apart and squandered a good opportunity for a good film."
5,Furnace,"I was not sure what this dvd was about when I ordered it, buy boy am I glad I did purchase it. This was a real mystery all the way through till the end. I can't give any clues as that will spoil the drama of this film. For a real treat you should see this one (maybe not late at night though)."
2,Weak TV cartoons based on Sunday comic strips.,This was Filmation's weak attempt to bring the Sunday newspaper comic strips to life. Featured (somewhat forgotten now) stars are:NANCY & SLUGGOALLEY OOPCAPTAIN AND THE KIDSTUMBLEWEEDSToo bad the writers of the somic strips did not have their hand at these cartoons.
2,Nice tool... poor quality control,"Looked like a pretty cool idea, and the screwdriver isn't bad. I think they have a quality control problem, however. I used this driver for some light duty stuff, no problem. Went to loosen a NYLON fastener that had a #2 phillips head on it, and it snapped part of one of the little wings that make up the phillips driver. Now it doesn't work on anything and since there's only a one-year warranty, it's in the trash can now. Maybe that's why there are none available!"
3,fair,"Not the best screwdriver I have ever had but pretty good, hangs in there with my Craftsman and Kobalt tools."
5,An excellent review of the methods of kiln building,This book is the best reference for pottery kiln builders and operators. I have built and operated Olsen's Fast Fire Wood Downdraft kiln form the book and converted it to gas with excellent results.
4,Not enough pieces,"I really really like lincoln logs. Everyone does. But, we bought this and received a big bin half full of lincoln logs. Why don't they fill up the bin? Also, the little roof was plastic, limiting the types of houses you can build. The old-style wood slates were better."
4,Tons of fun,This product is fun for the whole family. I hope my kids have as much fun as I did with them when I was young.
3,Barry & The 70's,"There are some great songs here, specifically tracks 1-12. Why in the world re-record Mandy and the rest? Barry does seem somewhat uninspired. Barry, your much better than this. There are so many great songs from the 70's that you could have done, even a double cd and not even scratched the surface of the 70's material. The re-records are extremely boring. Five stars for tracks 1-12, one for 13-18. Avg. three. Very disappointing."
3,Previous Two Were Better,Although I am a huge Manilow fan I was dissappointed with his 70's CD. The song selection could have been better and more upbeat. Hey if Johnny Mathis can do a version of I Will Survive why can't Barry???
1,A Disappointed Fan,"I've been a huge Manilow fan for decades, but the 70s CD was a real disappointment. The choice of songs was not good and they certainly weren't songs that go with Barry's voice. He made a total mess of ""The Way We Were"" and ""Sailing."" The man who is known for ""music and passion"" certainly had no passion for this CD. At best, he manages ""mediocre"" on a few cuts. I think Manilow has gotten to the point where the people around him are afraid to tell him the truth. He does have a nice voice, but not for these songs. Buying the CD at full price is a rip-off. Buy a used copy, listen once, and then re-sell it to get your money back. Let's pray he doesn't feel compelled to do an 80s CD!Save your money and go see him in Vegas. He really does rock in person!"
2,Karaoke from Clive,"The main reason to own this latest collection from the Clive Davis assembly line is the tastefully stripped down and, at moments, breathtaking renditions of Barry's own hit songs from the nakesake decade. It is on these tracks (most notably Copacabana and Even Now) that there is a trace of emotional connection between the singer and the song, and something new to be found in revisiting familiar territory.While it's impossible to dispute the commercial success of the formulaic collections that have become the Davis stock-in-trade, it is none-the-less unfortunate that a talent such as Barry, who has demonstrated an aptitude in the distant past for much more interesting interpretations of classic songs, is now satisfied with turning out such utterly bland and pointless material."
5,BARRY MANILOW - THE GREATEST SONGS OF THE SEVENTIES,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CD. IT SHOWS THE VERSATILITY OF BARRY AND WELL AS KEEPING WITH THE STYLE AND BREATHE OF HIS MUSIC. THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE IN KEEPING WITH THE MANNER OF NELSON RIDDLE AND AN ERA WHICH WAS THE VERY BEST IN MUSIC. BARRY MELTS AWAY THE ROCK ASPECT OF CONTEMPORARY POP MUSIC AND LENDS A ""NAT KING COLE"" SOUND TO SOME OF THE SONGS OF THAT ERA. THE ALBUM IS SIMILAR TO THE GREATS OF THE 50'S IN WHICH THE SONGS ARE SUNG WITHOUT EMBELISHING TRICKS USED BY MODERN SINGERS. BARRY LAYS IT OUT AS IT SHOULD BE SUNG. A TRIBUTE TO MUSIC.........."
3,Not the same...,"I adored Barry Manilow's music in the 70s, however ""The Greatest Songs of the Seventies"" didn't quite deliver for me."
3,Barry's Songs of the 70's,Barry is always good - but I do have to say that I enjoy his 50's and 60's albums more.
3,Sorta disappointed,"I am a Manilow fan. Yes, I am. The songs on here that are not his are okay. They are good songs by a different singer and I really like Barry. However, the new versions of his old favorites just don't have the passion that he usually has. Maybe he has sung Mandy a thousand times too many and just can't be excited about it any more, but really. This was just blah!"
5,Barry Manilow-The greatest Songs of the Seventies,"I grew up with Barry Manilow, he was always good and he wrote all of these songs. I saw this concert on TV and knew I had to have this sound track. It is great if you like easy listening and Barry Manilow."
2,Under produced.,"I went for this album because I bought many of the songs as originals back in the 'old' days.Now don't get me wrong, Barry plays a good piano, but there are almost no other instruments heard on this album. Money? Studio musicians must cost too much these days."
2,ode to manilow,"for over 20 years I have been a fan, you were such a talented man, but your looks are gone, your voice is too, you are not the same man who sung ""THIS ONE'S FOR YOU"". This album is weak which is sad, with all the good records that you have had. If you can no longer make good records on your own, find someone who can, or pack it up and go home"
2,Not Barry's Greatest Work,"There is one thread that is present throughout this album, the fact that Barry Manilow seems totally uninspired. I am a fanilow and have been listening to his music since I was a fetus but this one was a misstep. I had big expectations for ""The Way We Were"" and ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" but both were huge disappointments. Clay Aiken's version of ""Bridge"" is way more on point in terms of the production and surprisingly the vocals. Manilow even seems bored singing his own songs in an acoustic styling. They were very bland and sound much better on any of his live CD's then they do on this CD. When you tack on all of the songs from the 70's that were left off of this CD this was a lackluster effort at best."
5,Barry Manilow's Seventies CD,I have loved Barry's music since 1975. I have most of his albums and now CD's. They are the BEST!
4,Very Technical,"I am an Electrical Engineer, not an Astrophysicist. The evidence which Mr Arp calls ""obvious"" required concentration and some research to confirm for me. Possibly astronomers will find it both obvious and conclusive, but I struggled to make sense of it.However, I did make sense of it, and finally found the evidence compelling. Mr Arp demonstrates conclusively that belief in the big bang or that red shifts equal velocity of expansion is a matter of faith, not scientific evidence.I personally have encountered physicists who go looking for evidence to fit their pre-established theory instead of the other way around, and I found that part of the book intriguing and readily believable.The big bang has always done violence to scientific principles and I have always found it to be more of a dogma than a theory, but here at last is the explaination of the red shift which has until now been big-bangers only real ""evidence"" of any expansion."
1,Supernova evidence of doppler red shift can't be ignored.,"I bought this book because I am a dissident also. I was dissapointed to note the word ""supernova"" appears only once in the glossary and nowhere else in the entire text. You can't deal with red shift without discussing supernovae evidence, so I didn't waste my time reading the book."
5,Great little item,I received this item quickly and I really like it. It holds a mic about as low as it can go on a desk or in the portable sound studio I made for my voice over business. If you don't want your mic to block your visual view more than it has to then this is the stand for you.
2,Disney needlepoint book,I was expecting charts to follow. The transfer patterns will be more difficult. I love my other needlepont book by this author.
5,Carruth lover,"This is my third Carruth sculpture and I love every one of them! Lots of people have sun sculptures in their yards or on their houses, but how many have a sun with a big nose?! This is a fairly heavy piece of work so be sure to use anchors when hanging. Packaged well, also."
5,the hills is lonely,"A beautifuly soft and funny book, Ms Beckworth captures the soul of the Shetland Isles. A retired School teacher retires to a remote isle and re-discovers the Human nature. You need to have a love of nature to truly appriciate her view of the world. In this rush, rush world we have evolved to, her story allows us to slow the pace for a while and enjoy the simpler pleasures of life. Try the other 2 books, The Load Halo and The Sea for Breakfast. This is a book you would want when the day is cold and wet. Short but full of characters."
5,Just like they used to be,"Bought Uno for my family at Christmas time. Everybody enjoyed them, including those who had them in the 70's and those who never had them before."
5,Love these....,These have always been my favorite candy bar. I was distressed years ago when the stores stopped carrying them. Thank you to Amazon for selling them. They are as delicious as they always were.
2,Not what I expected,"While surfing Amazon, I found UNO Bars. I thought Great! Since I came from Seattle I fondly remember UNO Bars. I ordered them and was very very disappointed. While the candy is good, it doesn't compare to the UNO Bars I got as a kid. Will not buy again."
4,Go for beginners,"Since we are stuck inside till the thaw here, and this book is written in English it was a good purchase"
4,Go for Beginners,Met my expectations. Very good for teaching a beginner like me and my son how to do this game and have fun at it!
3,"Uhm... fine, but...","I examined carefully the book preview of this and other go books, looking for some arguments I found a bit difficult to understand only with what I found on the Net, from opening strategies to particular techniques or even explanations on some terms. When I found them here I was anxious to read it...But it's not what I was looking for...The book is written quite clearly... but only quite. Many, too many things are in my opinion just viewed, not explained, so it's difficult to understand why (the worst question!) this move is better than that one, or why you should play there instead of here. And for a beginner-to-intermediate player that's a point.If you want a beginner book AND you have the possibility to study go with a lot of players, maybe you can find it useful, but if you're just a beginner like me and want a clear introduction, find something else."
2,There are much better beginner's books available now.,"This is an old outdated book. It is slightly better than some of the original beginner's books by Laskey, Smith, and others. There a far better books available. Janice Kim's ""Learn to Play Go"" is an excellent example. Please note that I have the greatest respect for Iwamoto. His book was the best English language beginner's book when it first appeared."
1,Sends expired candy!,This candy says best before 12/05/12 and todays date is 1/29/2013. That's why this place sells cheaper. They also do not package well and packages where damaged!
5,Best snack!,"I'd never heard of the Big Hunk, but going by reviews of others I ordered them and will order them again! Reminds me of Bit-of-Honey candy, but easier to eat. Just wish they weren't so high in calories. Never mind! You need to try them!"
3,Not bad,"I bought this as a gift for my mom at home. I'm in college so I left my dad to give her the gift I ordered to be sent home. I'm assuming the candy itself was fresh and tasty. However, it was pretty pricey. Nice candy, if you're willing to spend the money that is."
5,"Loved as a child, still love it","I loved Big Hunks when I was a kid many years ago and have only been able to get them on a limited basis over the years since I no longer live in the west. For some reason they are more popular out west so whenever I am out that way or my son has traveled somewhere west and seen some, we've bought some. It's great to know that I can enjoy the great taste any time and not have to wait. It's hard to say that any candy bar without chocolate is one of my favorites, but I have to say that a Big Hunk is probably one of my top choices when it comes to a good candy bar."
3,Doesn't quite live up to the hype,"No problem with the quality of this Calphalon pizza pan, but it doesn't produce a crust any more crispy than rack cooking or a pizza stone would. The Calphalon sales literature in the box would have you believe this pan's technology is revolutionary. It' not.Overall, it's a reasonably good product, but I wouldn't recommend it over any other good pizza pan."
4,Functional but with problems,"I'm still using mine from my purchase a year ago, but I'm looking for other pans or methods. When spreading out the dough to flatten it, some of it passes through the holes in the pan making a mess and leaving us with less pizza. Sure, the pizzas come out great, but there has to be a better way."
4,very good thin crust pizza,"This is my second pizza pan, my other is a deep dish and is not coated. This pan is definitely my favorite, it produces a nice thin crust and even crisp cooking. The size at 16"" is just right for a family of 4. The non-stick works really well but keep in mind you need a big cutting board to slide the pizza on to cut it as you cannot cut on this pan."
3,I can never get it clean,No matter what I do I can never get it clean. I can wipe and wipe and even soak it for a long time but it never comes clean. It is great for cooking but I tend not to use it because I hate the cleanup.
4,this book was a surprise,"I really enjoyed this book, even though it was not at all what I had expected. Set in the not-too-distant future, the story line is actually quite plausible, and it was interesting to read through these pages while keeping in the back of my mind how old I would be when the action is to take place.""Argonaut"" explores both the pros and cons of nanotechnology and addresses the issue of ""intelligence,"" specifically in how we determine sentience.I understand the reference implied in the term ""Argonaut,"" though I'm still puzzling over its use as the book's title."
1,Which album is this?,I own 15 GG cds and I have no idea which album this is. Is this gg and antiseen? If anybody knows the track listing please put it up.
1,not really good,this item is small and not durable at all .... with on touch it all goes down ... very bad item
5,Fantastic Book to Help You Eat Healthy,"I just have to give kudos to the authors for doing the seemingly impossible... a guidebook to healthy foods that taste great and can be found in most supermarkets. I'm usually overwhelmed with the task of trying to eat right since I love my comfort foods, but THE YUMMY HUNTER'S GUIDE got me out of my rut and now I'm actually excited about trying out new foods. Organized almost like a Zagat's travel guide this very fun to read but still practical guide is a bargain for all of those out there trying to eat fairly healthy without resorting to a Draconian wheat grass diet."
4,My Son had a Blast,"I wanted to write this review to balance out some of the one star reviews. I think there is more motivation to write a review if you have problems. My son has thoroughly enjoyed his Gaucho for more then two years. He is really sad that he has outgrown it and cannot drive it any more. We did have a problem with the main circuit board but they sent us a replacement right away under warranty and no, it didn't have to come from Italy. I think they're making them in the US now. The problem with the board is the ony reason I didn't give it five stars. The most fun my son had with his was blowing the doors off the other kid's ride-ons in the neighborhood. The 24 volt Gaucho is MUCH faster than any of the other ride-ons. The rear suspension and disc brakes are cool too."
1,Garbage!,"Just don't buy it!It looks fantastic, it IS fantastic .. when it works, it just doesn't work very often!We paid over 700 for this jeep as my son who was 4 at the time was car mad, he's barely used it and we've had several problems, ie, the front wheel falling off, and a problem with starting the jeep. It's very flimsily made and I expected SO much more for the money!Very very disappointed, I just feel ripped off."
1,Huge mistake,"I bought this for my sons birthday. It has been broken for months... They have sent me parts twice and try to talk you over the phone on how to be your own mechanic. There is no service center within 4 hours of where I live and they can not seem to figure out what the problem is. Do not buy one. I have tried to get a new one, I thought I had a lemon but I see from my research that they are all faulty. I am turning in a complaint to the better business bureau and I am taking it up with American Express for them to deal with. I have wasted hours on the phone and In 8 months my boy has only had it working for 1!!!!"
4,Details to Examine,"We have this book and the Art Fraud Detective. They are great to have kids compare information. My kids like finding the differences, but have not finished either story yet..."
1,RIP OFF!,ALL GLOBAL TREASURES DVDS ARE LESS THAN 10 MINUTES LONG! RIP OFF! YES YOU HEARD ME RIGHT! LESS THAN 10 MINUTES! I BLAME YOU TOO AMAZON! DONT OFFER TO SELL ME S H I T LIKE THIS!
4,specialized & well-suited to those needs,"As the names implies, it is what's now known as a ""tactical knife"", designed no doubt for law enforcement & military personnel. Its long, relatively straight & slender blade renders it best for slashing & thrusting. It lacks the ""belly"" for a skinning knife although its sharp point might serve as a ""caping"" tool for a trophy. Since it's somewhat narrow it might not be the first choice for a heavy-duty survival knife but if pressed into service it should be a big help nonetheless. Since it's over 4"" in length it might be illegal in many venues. It would be prudent to check before carrying one in locales where their police are skittish about having anyone not in their profession possessing one. As with nearly all Spyderco products, it is of excellent quality, especially with the newer VG-10 steel."
5,Razor Sharp,If you like knifes this is one to buy. Its razor sharp I have alot of knifes and Spyderco is one of the best brand knifes made. If you were needing just one good kife this is the one to buy.Its sturdy sharp and fits in the hand just right. It keeps a edge well. Its a thin knife and has a low profile for carry. I love this knife and have the straight edge as well.
5,Superb,"Great knife - perfect for carring in my back pocket when out on the road, on the bike. Can cut through almost anything. Had this years ago, some idiot stole it, and I was so glad they still made it."
4,Spyderco Police Special,"Nice knife but very hard to open with one hand and brother does it scratch easily. A stronger clip on all Spyderco knives is well over due, if you run with any of my Spydercos in the back of your sweats you risk losing it.D."
5,Over and over,This CD has being playing in my car over and over and over for almost a year... My daughter loves it!!!
3,Jump and Jive with Hi-5,"I saw the group on television and when I ordered it from Amazon, I thought it was the DVD of their shows, not just a collection of their songs. I was quite disappointed but perhaps it was my mistake. Does Amazon have the DVD?"
1,Disappointing,This cd is really disappointing. I heard the australian cast and they are much better singers and dancers and they are good at lots of different things. This cd is the american one and in my opinion they are not as good singing. Theyre accents are funny.
3,what a CD!!!!,"My sons are 4 and 2 years old, and both are so happy with this CD. They love HI-5, and this CD is very complete, it has all the good songs from the show. I recommend it very much"
5,Just for your kids,It was incredible to see my 2 year-old son jumping and singing with the music of this television band. He remembers the moves and part of the lyrics so every time I play this CD I can see a great smile in his face.I really recommend this CD for your kids. You won't regret it.
5,Excelente trabajo!!,Muy buena musica y calidad vocal... fue una muy buena compra y para mi bebe el mejor regaloLo recomiendo de todas maneras!!
1,"This is not ""Karaoke""","This product is mis-leading. It is labeled ""Music and Karaoke"" but this is not a CD-G Disc. I was very dissapointed when we popped this CD into our Karaoke player and no lyrics showed up. Do not buy this CD if you think you will see lyrics on a Karaoke machine...the only lyrics available are on the insert to the CD.Big Mistake!"
1,Freud would've loved this guy...,"The author of this book is a therapist's dream. He needs counseling through his next ten incarnations. He has delusions of every kind, including apparently believing that a woman might choose to kill her child after having it for three years. This novel is definitely anti-woman, as all Fundamentalist Christian tracts are.The writing is jumbled and confused, just like his thinking processes...it's impossible to tell whether he thinks this is Science Fiction, in which case he believes (hopes?) it might come true one day; or a fantasy. If it's the later, the suspension of disbelief is way too high for anyone not on acid."
5,A teacher highly recommends book,"I bought this book because I found the title intriguing. As a public school teacher, I deal with environmental issues on a daily basis with my class of fourth graders. The name ""Gaia,"" the Earth Mother, is used prominently in public school curriculum. So, I was interested in what the book was all about. When I opened it to read, I was so caught up in the storyline and the author's style of writing that I found it difficult to put down. I finished it in four days. I was totally captivated by the fast-paced story. I thought of Orwell's ""1984."" The author's insight into the move toward a one world government and a unified religious system was eye-opening. And his depiction of Steve Weston's battle with the Dark Forces is captivating. I highly recommend this book, especially to teachers. But be sure to allot some time, because it will grab you from the very first chapter. In fact, ""Seal of Gaia"" may prove to be one of the most important books in circulation today."
3,A little shocked at the praise,"not the theological hand-clasping, I expect that.But from a teacher? And a few complementing the writing and use of the english language? Puh-lease!It takes all kinds. I still think its good 'cause its BAD!"
2,Not too bad for a first novel,the book is entertaining and a good way to kill time on a plane. It's not deep nor especially well written - this author has a long way to go before he is a Dean Koontz or a C. S. Lewis - but it's not especially bad either.The plot is developed well though the outline is visible beneath the prose. Overall it's a good read if you have nothing better handy.
3,"fiction not fact, but promoted incorrect ideas about others","which is why the left is angry- how do Christians like being portrayed as racist sexist bigots? Same to for the left being portrayed as selfish mean people who hate children and old folk (esp as its the left always increasing health care and funds to the elderly and such. For the New Agers I know, three yr olds would be running the world since the folks I know think their precious little pure embodiments of light and love can do no wrong. Little nits- timing was off in the novel, one page Steve Weston gets the job, next page he's been there for ??? awhile at least. Another, Lori tosses the paper handed to her by the reasonable quiet woman and after handing her unit over to be terminated, pulls a neatly folded paper from her purse. Second half? Definately a smoother read though. Sentence contruction, scene to scene transition flow was a bit easier. Who was his ghost writer and why didn't she/he take care of the first half?"
5,Incredibly Relevant Fictional Account of the Last Days,"The Seal of Gaia is a suspenseful, riveting fictional account of the last days. I have read this novel more than once and found it nearly impossible to put down once I began it. When I read it around the year 2000, I remember thinking ""Oh, this is only fiction, it could never happen in reality,"" but when I read it again in 2009, parts of it looked all too familiar to things that were coming to pass in America where I live. Nationalized health care that includes euthanization, a charismatic leader that appears to be for the people but leads them astray and constant conflict with other nations in the The Seal of Gaia suddenly felt all too familiar. The Seal of Gaia is an incredibly entertaining read for Christians and non-Christians alike. It is fast-paced and engrossing!"
4,Exciting after author estabilishes background,"Exciting book that makes one think what this electronic, technology pushing generation might evolve to in years of early 21 century.Enjoyed this well written book that borders on they edge of science-fiction.For a firt time novel Mr. Maddoux might just be a fresh new writer to keep up with."
5,Everythng I've hoped for,"Finally bought me a Radiohead poster, what better view than their best album OK Computer. Not sure if the hangers work using something to put this beauty up on the wall"
5,nice work,"delivered what they promised. great size, love the design. I ordered another poster from All Posters with this, got a great price w/ a discount from them. Ordered it the 14th, estimated delivery was 20-23, got it on the 18th, might've even gotten here the 17th."
5,WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This disc IS the best thing to happen to Vivaldi and Baroque music in a long time !! Fabio Biondi and Europa Galante give an unsurpassed interpretation of the pieces. They breath a very intense passion into the music. And who better to play it than an Italian violinist and a group of Italian string players! They give the Four Seasons something I believe no one else can. BRAVO !!!!!!!!
1,There is another,"Is it asking too much of a modern orchestra to play the notes as they are written? The L'Europa Orchestra evidently thinks so. This entire CD sounds like an old 45 rpm record played at 78 rpm speed, fast forwarding through Vivaldi's most essential works and losing the beautiful cadence for which he is so famous.There is another much better recording available. The Best of Vivaldi has just been released by the St. Petersburg Orchestra. It is an authentic reproduction of Vivaldi's work, it includes the Four Seasons ensemble, and it can be had for 1/3 the price of this dismal attempt."
1,Slow down??,"I'll be short. This is the only CD I have ever returned for a refund. What a total disappointment. Virtually the whole piece was played much too fast for the skills of the performers and the wellbeing of the music resulting in a slurred and imprecise product. Bad, bad, bad."
1,Pieces Missing,I was really looking forward to the 6 in 1 Screwdriver as I add to my tool kit. The most important pieces were missing. The diagram indicates two different pieces with different tips. Customer Service hopefully can send the missing pieces or replace the entire item. Wish me luck!
1,Seems unfair,Might as well buy each season seperatly since they cost almost 15 dollars less that way. don't get ripped off.
2,average at best not great,"When I bought this when all the reviews were 4 and 5 stars. So I am thinking, I can't go wrong. Once I got this I was pretty disappointed. The strainer is fine. But that's just it. Its average. The stainless steel is not any different than any other one can buy at walmart or here at amazon. I have had this happen before in amazon with other products. The first reviews are all great so I buy it but by the time I check the reviews two weeks later other more ""real"" opinions are written which I can relate to better (especially since I bought the item). I am not slamming this product. But When all the reviewers says this is ""perfect, great, I love it"", I buy it and when I get this product and its not that special I feel gullible."
5,The Perfect Strainer to Use While Washing Rice!,"This is a great colander, but..... I find it to be most convenient when used to wash rice.I put the rice into the strainer, hold it under the faucet, and rinse the rice well. This has been the fastest, and most convenient manner that I have found to accomplish this task.This strainer is very well constructed,as well as being quite streamlined, and beautiful.I highly recommend this strainer!"
5,At last - the perfect strainer,I had looked for a medium sized FOOTED strainer for years with no luck. I own a couple but with flat bottoms or a ring base which makes it difficult to drain some foods well. The raised bottom of the Polder allows for great air circulation which makes all the difference. The stainless is high-quality and the handles are a very convenient design. I love it!
4,"Not 9""","Measuring this strainer its 9 inches from the outer edge to the outer edge, measuring from inner ring to inner ring its closer to 8"". I like its but I wanted a 9"" colander."
3,Good for Garner fans,"Yes, I agree that the movie does not live up to the book. But, honestly, what movie adaption ever does live up to the book??? Plus, it's a Hallmark movie: I love Julie Garwood books; but I don't think Hallmark could/would make a movie with the kind of scenes from a Julie Garwood novel. There are huge differences between the storylines of the book/movie; but they are two different styles of storytelling and have to follow certain criteria (theme, story arc, etc.) I would recommend this movie for any Jennifer Garner fans out there. Its a descent movie to get your Garner fix (and you won't have to suffer through ""Dude Where's My Car""!)."
4,Good movie!,"I haven't read the book, but the movie is good, with some humorous moments and romantic moments. It's a very good family movie with an interesting plot--one of my favorites because it's very fun!"
2,This was not the Julie Garwood book at all,"I bought this movie expecting to see Garwood's book brought to life. I think the only thing the screenwriter read was the back of the book! There was no romance and it was disappointing to watch, expecting (in vain) to see the funny and interesting parts of the book. If you have read the book and loved it, dont watch this movie. If you havent read the book, expect to see an average family drama."
1,awful awful awful,"There was no SPUNK! ""For the Roses"" is one of my favorite books, and boy was I excited to find in my local video store. What a waste of 90 minutes. There was none of the charm, none of the humor (except for a couple of chuckles), and zero romance!! There was no frustration that came with the Elliot family, no drop dead gorgeous man to sweep Mary Rose off her feet, and couldn't they have found a better Mary Rose? Mary Rose with a short little guy like Fergus?? COME ON! And where was Adam's elegance, and Cole's heart, and Travis's sweetness, and Doug's maturity? As a movie, even without the book, it was terrible. It left alot out and wasn't much better than a summary of the book (an inaccurate summary at that).I have never been more aggravated with a movie."
1,Rose Hill,"This movie used Julie Garwood's name, but I find it impossible that the screenwriter even read more than the first chapter of the original book. I am deeply disappointed in this movie, and I wonder how the author allowed her book to be changed so much. The original book centered around family, loyalty and love story that ended happily ever after. With two brothers dead and Mary Rose alone- this film left me depressed."
1,What a disappointment!,"As a huge Julie Garwood fan, I was very excited about seeing the book on film. The book and the movie don't have that much in common, except 4 brothers and a sister. There were extra characters that were not in the book. And yes, Mary Rose was not the sweetheart in the movie that she was in the book. Spoiled, selfish and a brat! There is a new storyline introduced that has nothing to do with the book. A sore disappointment for sure! Beware Garwood fans, you will be disappointed! The only reason this has 1 star is because I couldn't give it 0 stars!"
4,Rose Hill Rocks,"I purchased this movie as a gift. Not only was I surprised at how swiftly I recieved the order, but that it was in such great condition. The person to whom I gave it thoroughly enjoyed the movie."
1,Disappointing!,"Having read many of Julie Garwood's books, I settled down with bated breath to enjoy what I expected to be a brilliant film.How wrong could I have been?I can only wonder if the screenwriter actually read Julie's book. Other than the use of the characters names, this butchered story bore little resemblance to the original plot.All four brothers are much stronger characters and none of them were lost along the way to death! Where did Fergus spring from? And what happened to the English Lord?Arghh! Don't bother with the film - stick to the book it's a far better story."
2,Read the Book,"I am one of the few people who watched the movie before I read the book, but all I know is that after reading the book, which was wonderful by the way, I was deeply dissapointed with the movie. Not only did the screenwriter butcher the story, but he killed off my favorite charichter, Cole, and that was just wrong!"
5,How do you review RAM?,"I don't know how you would go about reviewing RAM but I guess I bought it for a good price, I received it fast and it seems to be working. :)"
1,Not what was in the picture,"The product contained packs of The Nightmare Before Christmas collector series I A-F trading cards, which is not what picture was used for the item. I was expecting a box of Nightmare Before Christmas Trading Game booster packs, which would have contained cards for the trading card game. Those booster packs are the ones shown in the picture, whereas the boosters I received are visibly different."
3,Value for money,This keyboard is a very good package for this money. The sound quality is good but the instruments tone somewhat lack originality. Also it is bit difficult to change the tones quickly as one needs to press the keys. I have another Yamaha keyboard which features a dial (like a volume button) for changing the tones quickly. Overall my wife and I are enjoying this keyboard.
2,Casio 3300 Keyboard,"This keyboard seems to have enormous capability and flexibility, but for some of my needs there are two huge lacks. First, it imputs only Midi Type 0 files. I have hundreds of old midi files I've produced, all in Type 1. With all the bells and whistles it has, why couldn't Casio have added the midi type as an option?Second, the input card is in the back of the machine, hard to get to, and not convenient for transferring when dealing with short midi files. The 3700 version has a floppy drive input, ON THE FRONT. Knowing what I now know, I wouldn't want this keyboard if they were giving it away."
5,"Satisfying music, instantly!","I stumbled on this keyboard at a big-box retailer. The first positive impression was the sound quality, but what hooked me was the auto-accompaniment feature. I was plinking away a 3 note riff, and all the sudden I had very fitting drumming backing me up. After a while the drumming got a little more interesting, and another instrument joined it. I was instantly making very satisfying music. After 15 minutes I got tired of standing in the store, and decided to bring it home. If you can put together a few good notes in a somewhat interesting and repetitve pattern, you will have a good time.I will update this review in a few weeks when I have more experience with it.[...]"
2,Too bizarre for my taste,"Part of the beginning was going along pretty well and I thought this was a nice flick. But toward the end, it was getting pretty boring and quite strange. Some shorts were pretty neat. But as a whole...well I won't rent it anymore."
2,Weak collection of shorts,"A couple of the films, like the one based on Gertrude Stein and the one about dog training, are passable. The rest are not well acted or well written. Disappointing."
5,What a voice,"Stamatis Kokotas is one of the classic and distinct voices that influenced and shaped contemporary Greek music. This an excellent compilation for both fans and others who want to get initiated in his music. The title says: ""unforgettable hits"" indeed they are."
3,The First Is Always The Test,"First in the Law and Order series, this is not the best one, in fact, it is the worst. It is usually like that in a series. I have played all the L&O;, all the CSI, and all the Nancy Drew games. It works that way with all of them.This game is very linear and unyielding. The interface is a bit clutzy. They have corrected these faults to a great degree with the newer offerings.The price being what it is now down to, this game is worth buying for the entertainment value or the collection."
3,Good to know before you purchase..,"This item will work with Win 2000, but you need to download the Win 2K driver from Hawking or the Internet before installation. I haven't figured out the MGI software that it came with, and am still having problems with their serial numbers included to install. The actual Hawking unit is simply a device that plugs into your USB on one end, and a single RCA video jack, OR (and this is important) an S-video jack. My older analog camcorder doesn't have S-video jack so I could have bought a cheaper, ""RCA jack"" only, unit. Overall the resolution through my camcorder is great; much better than just a WebCam."
2,not so great,"i read this book when i was in the eighth grade and i liked it a lot. when i got to high school i made my little brother check it out of the library for me so i could read it again. i liked it again. now i'm twenty-five, and i checked it out of the library at college, and i didn't like it very much at all. i remembered a lot more than i realized, and i was surprised to find out just how much i could recall about the book once i got going, but it is really very poorly written. i guess i liked the ideas when i was a kid, but the dialogue is unbearable--everybody talks like a soap opera actor, it's not believeable at all. i finished book one but i couldn't really get started on book two."
5,Science fiction adventure classics,"I have read the trilogy three times. ""Deathworld"" is about a planet literally at war with its settlers, a race of supermen. Jason din Alt, a smart-aleck gambler, becomes embroiled in their cause against his will. ""Deathworld 2""--din Alt is marooned on a backward planet of slavery, steam engines, and flintlock rifles. ""Deathworld 3"" is one of the most exciting. The protagonists of the original ""Deathworld"" decide to colonize a planet run by conquerors reminiscent of the Mongol hordes, complete with their own Genghis Khan leading them. Jason din Alt has to infiltrate the horde. All 3 books are very exciting reads!"
4,A good read,"Although I read this years ago, I remember liking it. If you like 'The Stainless Steel Rat' series, you'll like this book."
2,Blah,"A friend of mine recommended this trilogy to me describing it as an action paced must read. I stopped after the second book. The first book was ok, started out really well but I found it to be campy at best. The second book bored me to tears. I found the literary level average at best. The author justified what his character was doing so the story could continue or another character could remain in the story and that bothered me. I just skimmed through to the end. You may like it. I didn't."
5,Read this book over and over,"When I was in high school, I reread this book until it fell almost apart. I continue to reread it every few years. The main character is blessed with great mental fortitude and resourcefulness. Each of the books in the trilogy chronicles his adventures trying to stay alive on a different planet, each one extremely treacherous (and therefore a ""deathworld"") in its own way. I particularly remember the planet where he frees himself from slavery in a ""Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" way. Brilliant! Too bad that it is out of print as I write this, I think it is one of Harrison's best."
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this, despite my initial imprssions as I first started reading. I did think that the ending was very lame however. I recommend this, with reservations. I foudn it enjoyable, but not very deep. I do not see myself ever rereading this. Nor do I see myself chasing down another Harry Harrison novel. However, I could easily think of worse things that being stuck reading another of his novels."
3,Turok - DVD,"This was an interesting take on games. Quite bloody, the story does not always make a LOT of sense. The animation style is nice and if you enjoyed the original game you will find this anime entertaining. Background knowledge of the game is not needed to enjoy this movie. Lots of action, this is not an anime for small children. Not the best anime in my collection but certainly enjoyable - Turok fights to avenge the slaughter of his clan and save his childhood friend and her son from an old enemy."
3,Martin Gilbert's Vol I of the 20th Century,"Gilbert's approach in this volume was the simplest method of approaching history. He simply goes from year to year. This method does not allow for topics be uniform and disjointed. Rather than seeing the rise of Hitler or WW I to be seen as an important event in history one is left with a set of facts that could be lined up in one column without an understanding of the whole picture. Gilbert does write well, researches well and has a vast knowledge. This volume would be better served if it was done by the events that were important during this period."
3,Correction,"In my review, the book I meant to refer to was Barbara Tuchman's Guns of August, not Winds of War, which is neither nonfiction nor about WW1. (I used a neutral 3 *** here instead of my review of ** in order not to bias the results with a double entry)"
2,A Sorry Effort,"This is a lousy 800 page book that could have been a superb 500 page book. The author clearly is in love with the sound of his own voice and writes as if he were speaking to his students at Oxford. This does not work very well in print. The book is full of run-on sentences and tortured grammar of a kind that would net a sophomore at a middling American college a C- on an English paper. Decent editing just to eliminate verbosity would cut this tome down by a third. Gilbert's perspective is excessively Anglo-centric -- his main source seems to have been microfiche of headlines from the London Times for the years covered. And his strict year-by-year structure means that important themes are diced up and impossible to follow. Interestingly, the one time he breaks from this structure to write thematically -- his coverage of World War I -- the book works quite well. Sadly, these few chapters are not enough to justify the pain imposed by the rest of this doorstop."
2,Author in Need of an Editor part two,"You would think that someone who was knighted by the Queen and was an English subject to boot would know exactly how long Queen Victoria reigned for....on the first page of year 1901 he writes that she had reigned for ""sixty-one years""...though 1837-1901 does not exactly add up to sixty one years.I really couldn't get past the glaring errors...this is a real shame or sham when there are so many great historians out there who could be publishing and can't because people like Martin Gilbert are pumping out these editorial nightmares."
4,"Compelling, So far...","So far there have been over ten major publications of histories of the twentieth century, including from broadcast journalists (Peter Jenings). But none has yet gripped the scope of this great century. It makes you be glued to it's enourmously wonderful narrative, and accuracy. It's sympathetic, and thoughtful. But still, the countless refrences to the Jews gives it away. Nothing wrong with that. But too much: example: ""but Mark Felix (a Jew) was..."". But on the whole the book is an accomplishment. I would recomend this remarckable history to all."
2,This is the worst of the 3 volumes,I've read the last two volumes first. Now I'm reading this first one and it is awful. Where's the history on the United States or inventions or milestones. All Martin Gilbert talks about here is war overseas. He leaves one small paragraph a chapter for the US and any trivial information. I'm skipping through it faster then any book I've read. Thank god I read the 2 good ones first. I would think there's more history to those years then just the Balkans and Russia.
4,Compelling !,"My only gripe about this book is that, in trying to be comprehensive, it deals very lightly on the scientific, economic, cultural and artistic developments of the first 33 years of the century. How could he not mention the publication of Einstein's epoch-making papers in 1905! The author should have just concentrated on the political and military aspects; it is here that he is in his element. This is not analytical history, but I don't think it was meant to be. It sets out the facts plain and simple, and we are left to form our own opinions. And indeed I often paused to think about the implications of this or that event. Mr Gilbert is a fine writer, and his narrative becomes compelling as one reads on. The highlight of the book are the chapters regarding World War I; it is truly edge-of-the-seat stuff, which is quite remarkable for a narrative of this kind. Despite the faults, I enjoyed this book immensely, and I look forward eagerly to the remaning two volumes."
2,Author in Need of an Editor,"Unfortunately not up to Martin Gilbert's ability. This applies to both volumes. They are sorely in need of an editor. Errors abundant. An example, Gilbert refers to Roosevelt's Depression speech..""The only thing you have to fear..."" as a reference to impending World War II. Very narrow focus on 20th century which begs the titles ""Rise and Fall of Adolph Hitler,"" ""Europe 1914-1951"". Essentially, the book is a ""clip job"" that fails to take into account great and near great events, scientific, political, social and engineering that occurred in this century. This effort fell short of expectations."
3,"Adequate, but short range","Overall, this device functions as stated. Pairing was straightforward, and I do like how power management has been handled. The range for a powered device such as this one, is unimpressive. I have also experienced quite a bit of random signal loss when well-within the 10M range with line of sight. In the same environment, my mobile phone's bluetooth has twice the range with no loss of signal."
4,"Along with Sony Bluetooth Wireless Transmitter for iPod, good system.","Bought this along with the Sony Bluetooth Wireless Transmitter for iPod. Connected the receiver to mini-jack input in my Bose Sound Dock (any amplified system with an aux input should work), and transmitter to my iPod Classic 160GB. Sounds good (hard to tell if there is any difference bet. direct docking the ipod and using the bluetooth system). Setup is easy as pie. When iPod battery eventually runs down, simply dock it on the Bose to recharge - and listen while recharging. One gripe though; can't adjust volume using iPod via bluetooth - have to adjust the volume on the sound system for that."
2,SO SO Solution,"Paired well with iPhone and IPad. Problem is that if I leave it on (which is what I wanted to do)some kind of feedback loop develops and makes a loud and obnoxious noise in the speakers it's hooked up to. This is a big problem as it compromises the whole ""always on always ready"" concept. The noise goes away if I turn the adapter off and back on again.This is a big flaw in an otherwise decent product. Too bad...."
1,Very poor sound quality in transmit mode,"I only tried this in transmit mode, and I could not get a decent sound out of this. Through that device, the sound is noisy and unbalanced between left and right channels. It is not due to the receiver side, which sounds perfect with my phones as transmitters. After trying different distances, nothing improved.Sending this back."
3,only pairs with one receiver,"I was hoping to place the transmitter in front of my TV and listen thru bluetooth headphones or earphones. This works, up to 40 feet if you keep the antenna side of the headset facing the transmitter.But, it ONLY WORKS/PAIRS WITH ONE RECEIVER AT A TIME. This information is finally found in small print in the middle of a page just before troubleshooting section of the manual. so my son and i can't watch TV together with separate headphones after my wife is in bed which was the reason for purchasing this device in the first place."
1,I wish I could rate it -5,"This thing could not be worse. I'm using it to connect to my stereo receiver which is all of 5 feet away, and have it set up as headphones on my Mac Book Pro running Leopard.First, it can't connect to the device unless I run the pairing routine EVERY TIME, even though it's listed as paired in Bluetooth Assistant.When it does manage to connect, the reception is awful. I think I've gotten about 10 seconds max of uninterrupted audio...most of the time it drops out every 2 or 3 seconds.I've moved it closer and turned off all non-essential wireless services to absolutely no effect. I have no 2.4gHz devices in the house that would interfere, just a microwave oven 20 feet and three walls away.Once I figure out how to put it back in the packaging it's going back asap. Avoid at all costs."
2,"skips, skips, skips","constantly skips. even line of sight, can't reliably stream high quality Pandora. Must not have a reasonable buffer. Probably because this product is 6 years old. It was actually designed/copyright 2006! [...]"
4,Works fine,"I use it as a receiver, and is great and easy to setup. Only bear in mind the quality is not like connecting the iPod (which is what I use) directly to the iPod dock. You loose some volume and quality via bluetooth. It is great being able to control your music directly from the iPod though (as opposed to a limited remote)."
1,Poor reception,"When I tried this product, it only received a clear signal for 10 feet before breaking up. Far less than the 30 feet described on the box.I returned it immediately."
1,Garbage,3 feet away and it constantly cuts in and out. I got the Blackberry branded unit for less and it is flawless.
4,Range is about 10 feet,"I got this product so I could use my laptop or phone to play music anywhere in my room, which is probably 12x12. From my bed, which is probably the furthest away from the receiver, it does work 90% of the time. The only time it doesn't work is when my phone is plugged in, which is slightly further. The sound quality is nearly perfect most of the time, but sometimes seems to be a little slowed down, but I could be over-analyzing. Overall, the product works for what I wanted it for, but wish the range was just a few more feet (but I'm not sure of the limiting factor)"
2,Won't work for me,I tried a dozen different positions and combinations of wifi and bluetooth signals. Tbe bottom line is that in spite of changing router channels it appears that this will not work with wifi in the same area.My need was simple. To transmit internet radio from my iphone to my Vizio sound bar. Even by going to 3G reception on the iphone and turning off the wireless I couldn't get reliable performance.I ended up getting a Grace Solo internet radio and this approach appears to work well.
5,Great Transmitter,"At first i was sceptical in buying this , but went ahead and did,bought this to hook up to my LCD TV, was happy i did , works great , really like the auto off feature it has built in , easy setup , you only need to buy an extra cable if going to RCA jack on TV , very small.The user manual says to keep it about 30ft away from any wireless routers, but i have mine less than 20ft away from a NetGear RangeMax 108mbs , and 1ft from a PS3 and there is absolutely no interference. Bought this to go with the CARDO S2 headset.**Some user claim it was hard to setup , just follow the instructions, pairing is done by pressing the SET ID button before turning the unit on.**"
3,"Not for Use with ""Line-Out""","I purchased this unit in the hopes of using it to transmit sound from our TV to a blue tooth headset. It looked promising on-line; however, once I opened the box and read the instructions I noted a clear warning in the installation instructions that sound would be distorted if it were with the ""line-out"" audio jack rather than a headphone jack. Well, the instructions were dead on. The sound was horribly distorted using the line out jack from my TV. Unfortunately my TV doesn't have a head phone jack. So this unit is going back to Amazon. I'm sure that if I did have a headphone jack it would have been fine."
2,Anything but a wise investment.,"I purchased the HWS-BTA2W adapter a month ago. For a while it paired well with my iphone and the music streamed continuously, now the music cuts out intermittently every once in a while. I phoned sony support about the problem, I was told this problem was normal and can be expected. Those comments won't justify the price ofthe purchase, period."
2,False hopes,"The reception on this is miserable. You have to have direct line of sight and not be more than 15 feet away or it cuts out. The other lame aspect is you have to pair it every time. It is nice that it both transmits to bluetooth headphones and receives from PC, phone or ipad but for the price it should have a much better range and work without needing direct line of sight. I find motorola products for headphones and speakerphones will work from a much greater distance (sometimes to far) and don't require direct line of sight. I wish they made a home stereo bluetooth receiver."
2,Can't get it to work with Jabra Sport,"Goal was to use this with my Jabra sport cordless headphones for use on the the exercise equipment. Still unable to pair them --- both devices show they are in pairing mode, but they cannot find each other. I have an email into both Sony and Jabra for help, but not optimistic. Will update as necessary.----- Update -----The Sony Bluetooth transmitter does not support HSP and/or HPA - so most newer devices will not pair. Have one if anybody wants one cheap :) Should have bought from Amazon so i could return it..."
1,Nothin' But Trouble (When Used with VAIO Laptop),"This device is probably more trouble that it's worth for those trying to pair with a computer, or at least a Sony VAIO laptop. The HD Audio mixer installed on these computers (and common on lots of laptops) conflicts in some way that allows pairing but prevents music streaming. A Sony tech helped me disable the HD Audio mixer and I was able to stream. But... as others have reported, the music drops out frequently and the music speeds up and slows down, resulting in annoying pitch bends, during playback.These quirks are device-specific. I have a Sony HBH-DS200 that suffers from none of these troubles. But, even here, weaknesses in Vista sometimes cause disconnect during playback."
2,Really didn't work for me,"This had too short a range (couldn't make it across the room) and required a n outlet plug-in to work. I wanted something for running that didn't require me to plug this into this, that into that, until it felt like an Erector set project. It just didn't suit my needs."
1,"Easy to hook up, but unusable due to audio problems!","Hooked up without a hitch to my Lenovo T61 laptop. Sounded great at first, but then the problems started. The audio slows down and speeds up! Enough as to make it very annoying and essentially unusable, as it changes the pitch of the whole song. This is inexcusable for an audio product! Hopefully the seller will allow me to return the item."
3,No me gust√≥,"Pesimo Alcance, s√≥lo da como 3 mts de alcance (se supone deben ser 10), se corta la se√±al con cualquier obstaculo. Tiene mas alcance un celular."
3,Works OK,"Ok product if you want to play music from your phone via bluetooth. Quality is just Ok, not as good as playing it directly via headphones or on your PC. I also use it to transmit TV audio to my bluetooth receiver, sound quality is OK and stereo only, audio seems to be in sync with TV. Cuts out every now and then due to Wifi interference presumably 4 both transmit and receive modes."
4,Sony 2 way Bluetooth,I use this to transmit music from my ipad to my stereo and it works well. I believe they say you should have line of sight but I have the bluetooth on the floor upstairs from where I use my ipad and it works OK (seems to transmit through the ceiling and floor OK). It works best when directly below and OK if I go 15 feet but drops off after that. It's a little tricky setting up several devices. I keep it simple by just using the ipad. Sometimes I have to re-establish the connection using ipad settings but that's pretty easy.
1,Bluetooth Passcode,"This unit works as a transmitter ONLY with headsets that have a Bluetooth passcode of ""0000"". It can't be changed. Nor can the passcode on my headset, which is set to ""8888"". So they can't link up. Oops. This one is on its way back."
3,Meh...should have known better.,"While this product does what it's advertised to do, the sound quality is mediocre at best. Bluetooth still has a ways to go on that front.I got this to pair my Droid to my work stereo set up. Even with high bit rate mp3's the sound lacks any kind of depth or clarity. Running a direct 3.5 mm stereo plug to RCA in or a good FM signal or CD is FAR superior. However for a quick fix or maybe streaming talk radio it's adequate. If you're looking for any kind of good quality sound this isn't going to cut it."
4,"As easy as 1,2,3","No problems setting it. At first my bluetooth headphones didn't match and they were like 20cm away. The manual said ""put the devices closer"". I though 20cm was more than enough and simply the devices were unexpectedly incompatible (SONY DR-BT50 headphones) but then putting them at 10cm or so made them pair.And since them, voil√†."
3,Beware,"Sometimes this device works well, sometimes it does not. At times the transmit quality is poor. It worked well transmitting from my computer to bluetooth headphones, but did not work well (poor sound quality and interference) when transmitting from my Panasonic plasma tv. I also hooked it up to the output of a memorex dvd player to play mp3 files from a flashdrive. The sound from the tv was good, but when played through this device to my bluetooth headphones, the sound quality was poor."
2,Dissapointing,"After first being introduced to streaming music via bluetooth in my brother's car (We paired my ATT Tilt with his car and I DJed). I was really excited to find something that would allow me to wirelessly connect my laptop or phone to my home stereo.Enter this product......Aside from a noticeable degradation in sound quality (which didn't occur at all with the car) the device will randomly drop the signal resulting in a choppy sound. The devices are less than 10 feet apart (the car pairing didn't exhibit signal degradation until approx 30 feet)All in all... good idea, kinda works, just doesn't work quite right often enough to be a good product: dont buy it."
3,"Works, but not suitable for music","I'm using this to drive speakers from my iPhone when listening to music. The sound quality is very noticeably worse than when the iPhone is directly connected to the speakers. This is a known limitation of the A2DP technology. In my case it manifests as warbly-deep-frying type of noise that infects the ""sshhh"" sounds in vocals and loud cymbals. Instead of sounding like ""shhh,"" it sounds like tiny spiders are frying miniature bacon on the surface of my eardrums.Bottom line: Good for any application where tip-top audio quality is not required."
4,works well,"initial setup was a little less intuitive than i would have liked, but after reading the instructions, everything is working fine"
2,Not satisfied,"We really wanted to find a blue-tooth audio transmitter. We really wanted this to work. We ended up trying two of these. The first one didn't consistently or successfully enter into pairing mode for transmitting. Didn't perform the way the manual described. We returned it and obtained a replacement unit. That unit did successfully work for pairing transmitter-wise, but the audio had too much delay for our needs since we were attempting to watch TV. Too much delay entered in, and the sound wasn't up to expectations. Our blue-tooth headphones sound great when listening to other devices, but just not when receiving from this transmitter. Hope Sony or another manufacturer comes up with a good blue-tooth transmitter, because we would like to use this method for TV watching."
4,"Not perfect, but better than some",I have had much better luck with this transmitter than previous ones and will be keeping this one. It works really well to send audio to my Sony bluetooth headset for when I'm on the treadmill.
2,Doesn't work too well,"The signal drops off and the noise levels are very bad if you step further than 1.5m away from the unit, which kind of defeats the purpose."
3,I think ok,I think it's ok but because the sony headphones don't work properly that ADORAMA sold to me and won't replace I don't know if it is the headphones or the sony adapter but the sound breaks up all the time don't buy
1,A complete POS from Sony,"What a terrible waste of money. 2007 HP notebook, itunes and sony bluetooth feeding my home receiver. This thing cuts out every chance it can, about every 5 seconds to be exact. Music sounds horrible!!!! Sony should be investigated by the FTC for selling this piece of junk. I want my money back."
3,Used with hearing aids,"I bought this Bluetooth device to connect the audio from the tv and send it via Bluetooth to my hearings aid, you can connect your computer, your player, anything that has a audio output. Work pretty good when nothing is in between you and the device, and in a distance no more than 20 feet. You can control the volume without annoy others. I can send my music from my Iphone to the home theater system. You can pair with more than three diferent Bluetooth devices. Good device for the money."
4,Works With Ipod Touch 3G,"Product works fine with Ipod Touch 3G, but you won't be able to adjust volume, only change between songs. In order to work fine, you must pair devices each time you turn on bluetooth on ipod. It is a small device, more or less is 3/4 the ipod touch length. Overall is a good product."
5,"Does what it say on the tin, and well so far","Only had it for a little bit, but this thing rocks. It is precisely what I was looking for. (I am using it in a car stereo system with a sony multi voltage car adapter you can get elsewhere on amazon.)Also, the images make it look big -- it is not. it's TINY. Imagine rolling your hand into a fist and gripping a small screw driver handle. It's about the size of that handle. Tiny.The range is pretty puny too, as other reviews have stated. However, I've never ever met a bluetooth device that really goes beyond 20 feet anyway, and that's not the point of that tech anyway, so I'm quite happy with it."
5,The Mini-Disciplines a Maxi-Inspiration,"Dr. Ingram has brought the spiritual disciplines into managable minutes. Weekend marathons of spiritual highs sometimes crash in failure when we face the reality of Monday morning, but minutes devoted to spiritual growth and scattered throughout the day, can form a firm foundation.I am reading the book for the second time and sometimes limit my reading to one thought in order to digest the fullness of truth Dr. Ingram opens up to the reader.This is a book you will reach for first thing in the morning and refer to throughout the day. It has enriched my life. I gave a copy to a friend who said, ""Thank you, thank you. It is as good as you said."" Once you read this book you will want to send copies to your friends also.Naomi Voorhees"
5,Great Sound Quality and Long Battery Life,"I bought this product to sync with the aftermarket stereo in my car and it works so much better than any FM transmitter plus I don't have to have a tape deck. The sound quality is quite good, reception is clear and constant with no hissing, and battery life is very good. The only small issue I have is that it has a bit of an awkward power button and I don't like the fact that you have to hold it down for 3 seconds before it comes on. What's up with that? Generally though I really like it and am glad I bought it."
2,Unusable except for very short range,"This is going back. I purchased this to use with my MP3 player for jogging, on the treadmill / elliptical and also for watching TV at night without disturbing my family. I paired this with the Motorola S9 bluetooth headphones (which work great when paired with my bluetooth phones). At any distance over about 5 feet the signal breaks up. Never works through walls. When trying to run or work out using this just the movement of my body causes interference and the signal constantly breaks up. Totally unusable no matter whether I wear the radio / transmitter in front or back. I always clip it outside the pocket, but no luck. It's important to note that the S9 headphones paired with just my cellphone has a range of about 20 feet including through walls, through my body, etc. Just a weak transmitter on this Sony!"
3,Works ok but does have drop out issues,"This item does pair up with my Jabra BT530 pretty easy and works well with my Zune 80. It is pretty picky about where you put it. I will get drop outs fairly often unless I get it just right and do not touch the top of it with my hands. The range is horrible. I use it bowling and cannot leave it on the table about 15 ft away from the lanes without losing signal. I had to keep the zune in my pocket and use it that way. I also do not like the way you charge it. The stand is large and bulky, so if you want to take it with you it is a pain. Overall it is just ok. It does pair with my headset and work with my Zune but it is limited. Oh and the clip on the back it not real secure. It has fallen off of me three time today alone."
1,doesn't work with cardo headset,"This will not communicate with a cardo motorcycle headset, which I was told would work. It works with a different type of headset, but not it's intended use."
5,This SONY bluetooth dondle works great!,"I purchased this Sony bluetooth dongle and connected it to a Mix-It2 multiplexer on my BMW motorcycle. The Mix-It2 connects and amplifies signal from my Garmin GPS, Valentine radar detector, and Apple Ipod Nano. The Sony bluetooth dongle then sends the stereo signal by bluetooth to my SENA helmet communicator. The SENA twin speakers in my helmet play the stereo of the Ipod and the mono voice of the GPS directions and the ""alarm"" of the Valentine radar detector. The Sony bluetooth works great and holds a battery charge of at least 10 to 12 hours, a long days ride. On a recent trip to the Ozark mountains on my motorcycle, the Sony dongle worked flawlessly. It is easy to pair up with the SENA bluetooth receiver and I had no problems. The Sony dongle is not waterproof and is not made for operating in the rain, so on my motorcycle I keep it in an enclosed compartment or tank bag. Definitely worth the money and a good buy from Amazon.com."
1,Dead from day one,The battery does not hold a charge....Battery is not the replaceable type. Never had a chance to review any other attribute.
4,Won't pair with Jaybird,"I've used this transmitter for about a year with Insignia headphones and it worked fine although it's tough to power on if you don't have a long fingernail to push the little button in. I upgraded my headphones to the Jaybird 200 and bought only the Ipod transmitter hoping my Sony would transmit all the other non-Ipod devices. However, it will not pair even though both supposedly are A2DP. The curly cord is sometimes good but mostly gets in the way more than it helps. It works great in a fixed area like a fitness center (which is where I use it) where you can just put it down and work in a 30 foot circle around the device. However, if you have to carry it around with you or, heaven forbid, run with it, it's going to be in the way"
2,"Works OK, but must have line of sight","This worked great with my Sony bluetooth headset, but it always required a direct line of sight to the receiver. I would have my IPod in my pocket and this stretching to the collar of my jacket, and if I turned my head the receiver would lose the signal.As much as I love my bluetooth headset, using this became too frustrating. Guess I'll wait for another solution."
5,Excellent Product,Works as advertised. Easy to pair and use. Compact. Clip is handy and charger works well with long cord.
1,Paired But Never Connected,"Pristine package, charged until the little purple light went away. Paired but never connected to either my MBPro or Motorola Droid, both of which have connected to Sony bluetooth headphones, a Motorola bluetooth to audio reciever, and each other, so this unit is the problem and is being returned. Maybe I'll order another one to see if only half of them are bad..."
4,Nice way to transmit audio to bluetooth headset.,"This product works really well with the the Sony bluetooth earbuds. It's fairly convenient to use, and it sounds great. I live in an apartment, so I can't have my stereo turned up very loud. This headset is the answer. Paired with the bluetooth transmitter, I am able to enjoy my entertainment system without disturbing my neighbors."
3,OK but bulky,This worked OK but is sort of bulky . Also drains the iPod shuffle too much and went on and off with the blue tooth.
2,Pesimo alcance,"El alcance real es muy malo, con cualquier obstaculo se corta la se√±al, muy malo, estoy muy desepcionado del producto."
1,Keep away,"As you can see the singer is smoking on the cover! As a result his voice is very coarse and while singing you can HEAR him breathing in, as if he has an asthma attack. The cd was released in 2000 and by now nobody cares or remembers these songs. For people who want to listen to some good quality greek music this is the wrong cd/ wrong artist to start with."
2,Clearly a Sales Demo,"I purchased this hoping it would show me more on how to use the Kreg Pocket Hole System I already own. Even at $9.00, it's not worth the price. It's about a half hour long and shows how to put together a Non-Standard cabinet. My opinion is that you could figure out everything they show on your own. In addition, they continually try to sell the tools I aready own. Now, I love Kreg Tools, but, they should be ashamed to sell this DVD. It should be given away with every system as an extra. I just can't say how disappointed I am in paying for this DVD."
5,Oh yes!,Wonderful product. Paired with a little exfoliation my hands look soft and pretty. My knuckles were my problem area and it looks 100% better.
5,Great Old Classic,This is really a great old classic movie and the quality of it was really nice. If you have never seen this it is excellent.
4,Highly speculative but thought-provoking.,"In his latest book, Hans Moravec predicts that robots will take over Earth sometime in the next century. Although his predictions appear highly speculative and implausible, he grounds his speculation in current research and technology. When followed step by step, his predictions make internal sense, though many readers are sure to argue with some of the critical steps. Moravec, for example, insists that computers have, or at least will have, intelligence and something akin to consciousness. These assumptions are not central, however, to his predictions about the future of robotics. Although readers may disagree with his conclusions, Moravec's thoughts are worth reading for their insights into technology policy making and some of the possibilities of robotics. As a robotics researcher, he has valuable background knowledge, and he provides crisp reasoning behind his philosophical arguments."
2,Speculation big time,"This is an undeniably fascinating book, which presents highly imaginative vistas of a relatively short-term future. Now although the book is anchored on Hans Moravec's solid knowledge of things computational, most of the text comes across as little more than wild speculation a la Frank Tipler. Moravec's assumes the resolution of so many and so complex social, technological and scientific problems that it is difficult to follow the last two thirds of the book with a different frame of mind than that one would adopt when watching Star Wars. In particular, the pervasive idea of correlating raw computing power with intelligence, with complete disregard to the structure imposed on that computing power, results irksome. In summary, a very entertaining book that should be read with more skepticism than most books."
4,Ready for a leap of faith?,"Reading the prologue of Moravec's first book (MIND CHILDREN) introduced me to his unique perspective on humanity's goals. If you look at his work as being like the Bible (which isn't such a stretch, we'll see in a hundred years or so I guess) then this is simply his version of Revelation. The beginning is slow going, but the middle and end build up beautifully to an engrossing idea of what society has been all about from the start. Humans of the Earth, don't be afraid to pass along the baton of culture, when the time comes!!"
3,Not yet written but foreseeably funny,"So Hans Moravec has finally found a publisher! After having written a book some years ago and having announced another ('Mind Age', for those who can't remember the title) for years to come we are again in hopefull expectations for some glimpses into the masters brain. Well, for those who can't wait till 1999 here is a quick synopsis: Hans Moravec as well as the rest of the human race ist just an algorithm, which can easily be downloaded into a machine, which grants him and us eternity for ever (, or at least as long as the power switch is on.) However it stands to be feared (some might say: hoped) that much more intelligent robots, sketched by Hans-Frankenstein-Moravec will replace us earthlings physically and after a while will eventually get bored with us human algorithms and will simply delete our file or switch us off. So much for the human race."
5,Carruth is art,"This little pixie, one of a set of three, is beautifully detailed like all of the Carruth works. It is a great gift for anyone but I gave one to a new mom. And you don't have to keep in the garden, it looks just as wonderful indoors."
2,What Your Fifth Grader Needs to Know,This book might be okay for individual study but is kind of boring. I was looking for something I could work with my fifth grader on. I like the 1st grade book but the upper grades seem to lose interest for the reader.
5,Helpful,"Lots of info to check and keep them on track with ""national standards"", easy to follow, and fun information in an easy to read format"
1,"And then again, there's false witness...","...McDowell's use of the ""Lord, Liar, Lunatic"" trilemma is just exhibit A of the snake-oil McDowell sells. This trilemma leaves out obvious alternatives such as:1. The Gospels were wrong- Jesus didn't say it,2. Jesus may have been sane, but may have still mistaken himself for being the messiah- and in no way thought of himself, btw, as the bible-god McDowell worships.3. Other alternatives.If you want to see warped, dysfunctional thinking, go ahead and read this book...."
5,Time flows,"This is the second opus of Sergio Bross.Sergio is a well talented guitarrist and composer who lives in Guadalajara,Mexico.Compared to any medium size city in the world (specially in Mexico) Guadalajara is quiet and cozy. So reflecting what he lives everyday Sergio comes out with a quasi-conceptual album of classic guitar that is quiet and cozy too. If you have heard ""Puerto Bello"" (his first cd); ""Clara...claridad"" is miles away.Sergio digged into his spaniard heritage, and enlighted this work.This is not an easy listening cd; it needs your attention and your comprehension.Like ""Puerto Bello"", ""Clara...claridad"" has quality and it's called to be a classical of the new mexican music. Time flows and Sergio keeps on working. Listen to his work I'm sure that you'll like it."
2,Modern Music Lovers' Delight,"This CD will appeal to you if you are a fan of modern composers who can't seem to distinguish between music and sound. The best tracks are Klucevsek's own compositions, the others are just too noisy for me. Transylvanian Software is a better disk for adventurous but listenable virtuosic accordion playing."
4,Cutest Thermos I've ever had.,"I bought the pink one, and I really like it. Not only does it look great, but it works really well also. I just put cold water from the fridge in it and it stayed cold all day. The cup is a little small, that's the only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It fits in a tote bag, backpack, or large purse very easily. Because of the choice of colors, this thermos is suitable for everyone."
3,A decent anthology,"Not particularly noteworthy, but nonetheless a good addition to one's scifi library, especially one lacking any other series of anthologies."
5,Classic Stories,"I read this book many years ago and to this day several of the short stories stick in my mind. So when looking for a good book for my wife to read, I thought this was the perfect choice. Unfortunately, I didn't have a copy. So I was overjoyed to see this book being reprinted and eagerly ordered a copy.Look for ""Who Goes There"" which is the short story the movie ""Thing"" was based upon."
5,Lonely People,"If you're looking for Dan Peek's Christian rewrite of the great song written by America, Lonely People, then this is the only way you'll be getting it that's alternative to ordering the $50 vinyl album of Electro voice. And that's an ALBUM. This is a better quality version, and you can listen to it hassel-free in your car. Arrives quickly from Minnesota, great seller (Paramount)."
3,Their perfect rendition of NIGHT WALTZ is perfect,"I only liked 1 piece but what a piece. NIGHT WALTZ by Paul Bowles. It's a psychedelic masterpiece that Paul evidently channeled directly from God Himself. NIGHT WALTZ is a mosiac of bits thrown together. And luckily, the bits fit together perfectly."
1,Very disappointed.,"Locke writes in very long and convoluted sentences, with all the powdered-wig pomp appropriate to intellectual discourses of the time, 1690. Each of these sentences would required considerable rehearsal to deliver them in a way that pointed up their sense rather than obscuring it. But, Lois Betterton reads as though she's perpetually surprised at the course of Locke's sentences, as well as their sequence. I don't know where one would find someone competent to give a reading of this book, and maybe it isn't Betterton's fault. But, Blackstone should know better. They ought to commission a truly professional reading (by Betterton or another) and send that, with a note of apology, to anyone who purchased this audio book."
2,Psychogenic Movement Disorders,"Unclear content and unable to full up further details to make a purchase.RJ Cavanagh MD MPHPO Box 1285Chico, CA 95927"
5,Excellent,"This book was given to me by a friend during a difficult time and I have found it not only funny, but that it hits the mark, every time I pick it up. Stressed or not, this is a funny book and great to have around."
1,To think that trees were felled for this...,"This book was given as a gift to my wife, who looked inside and dropped it into the recycling bin about three minutes later. Look at the examples provided above: Are these useful suggestions? Are they even slightly humorous? Are they creative in any way at all? They're suggestions for stupid and boorish ways to irritate, annoy, and inconvenience other people for no reason whatsoever. There may be a certain strain of juvenile mind that finds these things amusing, but most of us (thankfully) grow out of these attitudes before we're far into adolescence. To the writer of this book, and to those who praise it, my advice is to get a life of your own and not try to cause annoyance in those of others."
2,Poorly built and bad quality material,"This table is pretty bad. The material is just cheap metal and a laminated piece of compress wood. Nothing like the old formica and stainless steel tables that it is supposed to look like.Also, because the metal parts are so lightweight the table is not stable.Well, I guess that you get what you paid for."
4,Very Nice!,"We bought these tables for the office, for easy impromptu meetings. Have worked out great...will be buying some more!"
3,Not Macintosh compatible,"I've been quite happy with LogicWorks 2.5.2 on my Macintosh. I ordered LogicWorks 5, under the mistaken impression it was Mac-compatible. It's not. Apparently versions 3 and 4 are also not Mac compatible. I've now bought DesignWorks, which runs on OS X."
3,Useful yet buggy...,"Fairly useful program for building logic circuits and getting a visual of timing aspects, but program seems too buggy to totally recommend. I only bought it because it was required for a class."
1,Unusable VHDL implementation,"I've been using LogicWorks 5 for a university course, and have discovered that it does not even attempt to implement the VHDL standard correctly (admitting as much in what little documentation there is), and that it generates entirely useless errors when it is unable to interpret a line of code; whether this inability is a result of an error in the code or one of the many bugs in logicworks itself is impossible to determine, and you're lucky if you get so much as ""Syntax error"" as far as a human-readable description of the error goes.Worse still, and affecting all parts (not merely the VHDL compiler) of the program, is the reasonably common error message which pops up for no clear reason declaring that a ""serious error"" has occurred and that ""your data may be corrupted,"" before encouraging you to exit and restart the program as quickly as possible. I can't believe my university paid for a piece of software that never should have passed QA."
4,Bought this as a gift.,I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. I don't really listen to Clutch so this review won't be helpful to many but he loved it : )
4,"A good book, but it needs to be more realistic!","I liked this book, it was very funny and interesting, but one thing. Anastasia is too naive and Sam is too smart! I'm an eleven year old and I know. In this book, Anastasia acts exactly the same as she did when she was ten in her first book. She also seems to still have the same intelligence, too. I am much smarter than her, and so is the dumbest kid in my class. Also, Sam is too smart! He is two or three in that book, and he has a complete vocabulary. Though there are many three year olds who can talk just as well, if Anastasia is very dumb and Sam is very smart, it just doesn't work out. But aside from that, this is a great book!"
5,Must Read Book!!,"Lois Lowry has written many great novels including Anastasia at This Address. The main character is Anastasia; she is a spunky, city girl, from Boston, Massachusetts. Anastasia is 13 and wants a boyfriend. Anastasia does something very unusual to accomplish her goal.This book is a must read book! The novel deals with relationships, because Anastasia wants a relationship with someone who is 13 years older than her. When Anastasia is waiting for a letter from her &#65533;pen pal&#65533; the anticipation is greatly increased. Some novels have great expectations as does this one, I expected it would deal with growing up and it did. As you can see this book is a must read.Lois Lowry is a Must read Author that can change the way you look at things. She was born on March 20, 1937 in Hawaii. Lois has published over 20 novels, and winner of the Newbery Medal twice. Her books bring readers into many thought-provoking situations. Lois Lowry is a woman to be admired by all people."
2,The math study stinks,"Went through the book, took the practice test, scored an 85% on the practice test. Scored a 530 on the GMAT. Verbal 88 percentile (39 scaled) Math 17 percentile (25 scaled). The math questions in this book are structured differently then on the exam. The book relies heavily on the ""substitution strategy"", that is substituing given answers in a multiple choice question into the question's equation to find the answer. Well that may have worked before but the questions are now structured in such a way that the substitution method rarely if ever works. Also the explination of some practice questions are vague. For example, an explination will simply state, ""we know because they are similar triangles"" or ""we FOIL the equation"". These are basic concepts but it's been 10 years and I can't remember them. I didn't expect to remember them, that's why I bought the book."
2,nothing like the real GMAT,"The tests are not adaptive like the real GMAT, so the scoring is way off. Plus, the verbal questions are convoluted and unrealistic, and the tests are much harder than the real thing. You will most likely score at least 50-100 points LESS on Kaplan tests than you will on the official tests, Princeton Review, and of course, the actual GMAT. I do not recommend this book, unless you like freaking yourself out as you prep."
3,Cheap (in both senses of the word),"This edition has lots of typos and literally is filled with pages that have the same text from the previous page. The audience for this material is actually those whoe are totally unfamiliar with recent exam format.All of a sudden, i just realized that I used REA to study for the GRE's, which helped me get an 800 in math..."
4,good buy,"My only complaint is that the math sections need to be more in depth. The math review at the back of the book only has 1 example per problem type. This is far from enough. Remember, most people haven't done 80% of this math since highschool. There should be at least 3 examples per problem type."
4,Ditto,"It's true. These tests are MUCH more difficult that the actual exam. I scored 550, 560, and 580 on these. Did 720 on the actual test. It's good practice. The book is worth it."
3,"Good practice problems, bad presentation","I preferred 'Cracking the GMAT', which I read first. I ended up using this book primarily for the practice problems. My big complaint with this book was that in the answers to the practice questions, the problem isn't included. To see the original question, you have to flip to the quiz, then back to the answers...this style makes it difficult to see where you went wrong.Note that the CD version only works on Windows, and you won't see this information printed anywhere obvious."
2,Almost no correlation with actual GMAT,"I tried to study for the GMAT from this book, the official guides from GMAC and the Princeton Review guide. I found that this book and its sample questions and practise tests had very little to do with the GMAT test itself. You can see this if you take one of the tests on the accompanying CD and then compare it to the one of the practise tests from GMAC. I was actually very discouraged after doing some of the practise tests on here and thought I was going to do badly on the GMAT. I should have known better. I ended up with a 770 on the exam and a 6.0 on the AWA part. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The Princeton Review GMAT guide seemed to work a lot better for me. My big complaint about Princeton Review, however, was the lack of actual practise tests."
4,Good introduction,This is a good introduction to the GMAT and how it works. If you need more specialized practice I would suggest purchasing the subject specific guides published by GMAC which makes the GMAT test.
3,scores were all over the place,"I aced my first practice test, then didn't do as well on the rest. I was studying tons, so my score should have gone up. I suppose it could have been operator error, but I think these practice exams are screwy.Nevertheless, practicing on the computer did help me prepare for the format of the actual exam."
3,Excellent companion to official prep software,"I used this guide to prepare for the GMAT but I find that it is only useful as a reference as to how the GMAT is mechanically structured. Whatever skills you need to achieve your required score will depend on your grasp of the different mechanics called out in the exam. Therefore, I recommend the Kaplan guide to be used as a tool to help you succeed and not to be used as a ""pass the GMAT in 5 days"" program. You receive sample exams after registering for the GMAT, and those exams are much more realistic than the Kaplan exams. The Pearson GMAT Prep software is 99% identical to the actual exam, but the Kaplan guide provides many more sample tests and tests for the different sections. I recommend pounding away at the sample tests and just practice. I raised my practice test scores by over 100 points just using the CD and GMATPrep programs, and the actual exam score exceeded my expectations."
4,good book,Tips given in all sections are very useful. Match appendix is very useful. Got 780 in real exam today. Big draw back is that its tests are not even close to real GMAT. scoring is not similar.
5,You get what you need,This review is being useful and make study a lot easier. Let's see how will be my grades.
1,Do not buy this book,"I got a 710 on the actual GMAT a few days ago, and my practice test scores from Kaplan were 570 and 610. Don't waste your time or money with this book. Go to GMATClub.com and get some good advice on how to prep for this exam there. I used this book, PR, Veritas, Official Guide, etc. Make sure you take the GMATPrep tests from MBA.com too -- and those are free."
3,"Good Info, OK practice","I felt all the tips and info in the book were great. The questions on the quizzes and tests were not worded well. I used the Powerprep quizzes and tests to practice for the exam, they weren't as confusing."
4,Prefer the Princeton Review,Delivery of book was on time as always with Amazon...could have made a better choice in Review book...Princeton Review is more user friendly...Official GMAT review is what it is OFFICIAL
1,waste of my time,"Got this book because I'd used Kaplan to study for the MCAT, and that prep program was decent. The book is riddled with mistakes; content is duplicated, some questions are wrong (greatly confusing). Expected the CD to work on Macs which it didn't. Tried using it on Windows and it would crash after every few questions! Sort of hard to gauage where you're at at all when you can't get around to the estimated score or answers!Some of the problem sections in the book seem useful, but many of the explanations for the more difficult problems are poor and, as stated, some of questions are outright wrong. If Kaplan has any errata on their website I couldn't find them.If I could go back in time I would go purchase any other GMAT prep book over this one."
4,CD-Rom is the real value,"If you're short on time like I was, don't bother too much with the book. Just read the lessons in each section and then go straight to the full-length sample tests. Remember, those tests are scored much lower than the actual GMAT. My actual score was 150 points higher than any score I received on the sample tests. I only used this book and I feel like it prepared me pretty well. Friends who have used it in conjunction with other books scored pretty similarly to me."
3,what a joke.,"This is the exact same book as the 2006 edition, right down to the typos. All they did was put a new cover on it...not kidding! I'm in the process of studying for my GMAT, and I already had the 2006 edition when I noticed this one come out. Great, I thought! More practice! I was DISGUSTED to see that not a thing was different...not the sample questions at the end of chapters, not the practice tests...nothing. Just the cover.Save your money. Get 2006 version if it's at all cheaper!"
1,GLARING errors in the practice questions,"Buy the Princeton Review book instead. This book is incredibly frustrating to use because of all the errors in the questions. I would say 1 out of 5 questions has an error in it. Questions have key words omitted, words in the wrong order, lots of logical flaws. For example, one question states ""Students learn better when there is a low faculty/student ratio. Therefore I will enroll in a school with a small student population."" If there is a low faculty/student ratio, that means that there are very FEW teachers for very MANY students, not the opposite. But in Kaplan's explanation of how to answer this question, it says ""The correct answer is choice A, because the initial argument states that there should be fewer students for every teacher."" Ummmm, no, the initial argument states the opposite. Clearly they meant to write student/faculty, not faculty/student. Errors like these destroy any usefulness the book may have had."
2,Stay Away,"Stay away from Kaplan. I got a 570 on my Kaplan practice test and a 710 on the real thing. Very demoralizing to see such scores. Go to GMATClub.com and look through the archieves to discover better books, such as PR and Manhattan GMAT. Stay away from Kaplan - they suck."
5,Beautiful!,"I bought these for the women in our singing group. They are very pretty, good quality, and shimmer on stage."
4,Good gift item.,"This was purchased as a christmas gift, and item was shipped in plenty of time for the big day. Quality was ok, seemed very thin, but recipient really liked it."
5,The scarf was beautiful.,The Scarf feels soft to the touch and is very comfortable around the neck. It is a very good length. It came in the mail very quickly... there was no shipping problems. The price was great!!! Very Happy with the purchase!!!
3,Very Entertaining,"I appreciated the animation and most of the story lines presented. However, as a comic book fan of the JLA- I thought this sereies was too focus on the JLA V. Cadmus angle. It all build to one nemesis and the JLA is never that concrete. However, the shows are fun to watch and the new superheroes introduced add flavor and intrigue that the original seven never could have. Beware- some of the episodes-- This little Piggy/ Hawk and Dove are extremely churlish. But others-- Epilogue make up for that. Overall, its a worthwile investment!"
2,Duplicate discs,"The season contains two discs but I noticed last night that Disc 1 is basically a copy of Disc 2. Therefore, the season is incomplete."
5,Wonderful Purchase,"I was so excited that I could get these DVDs for such a good value through Amazon. This DVD collection contains 2 seasons of the Justice League Unlimited series, even though it technically only says ""Season One"" on the cover. What aired on television as seasons 1 & 2 are included in this DVD, and all the DVD commentaries are a nice addition. I definitely enjoyed the trip down memory lane, and even as an adult now, the stories are consistently well done and fun to watch. Highly recommended for the childish geek in some people. :)"
4,Hours of Great Entertainment!,I've only watched about half the episodes but so far I've been very impressed with most of the stories. I particularly enjoy the episodes that feature lesser knowns like Green Arrow and Dr. Fate.
5,pleased,I gave this as a gift and my friend was thrilled. the service was great... it shipped quickly as promised.
5,fan justice,"This is the best(so far)represention of DC Comics heroes in drama and action short of a live sction movie.Well acted and nicely drawn,I can'twait for the rest!"
5,Great acting.,Some of the finest acting on TV was done for the DC Animated Universe. JLU gives us even more bang for the buck. A great show.
1,once again the very very very very very worst show ever animated,justice league may be popular but it was not as popular as the batman animated series or superman animated series their are just to many superheros and villians for a 30 minute show besides i never like this show the way they treat superman and batman is terrible stick with the superman or batman animated series avoid this trash.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed from this season. It is in my opinion far less interesting than the previous Justice league seasons, or the Avengers. Every story is short, and a silly story about one or two of the characters. There is hardly ever an episode of true team work, and there are no complex longer stories with more than one part to them, like in previous seasons."
3,Justice League Unsubtitled,"I love the show, don't get me wrong, but big flaws keep me from giving it a good score.1: The interlacing is awful. What this means for you is that you'll notice half-images pop in and out, when the animation isn't so smooth.2: No Chapter Breaks. Makes zippping forwards and backwards inside an episode more difficult, having to manually scan.3: NO SUBTITLES. This i can't understand. Spanish and French audio tracks are included, which is good, but none of the languages have subtitles for hearing impared or when you want/have to watch in a quiet enviroment. This is literally standard for DVDs yet is neglected.in short, great series, but sloppy job transfering to DVD."
3,"Too violent for 8-year-old, but fun for teen or adult","Our 8-year-old daughter loves Super Friends, a very tame superhero series that has no violence at all, terrific for ages 5 and up. Justice League features similar characters but requires a more mature audience. It has bad guys with live machine guns shooting at innocent people (though nobody gets hit), and the fighting is quite forceful. It's not appropriate for kids her age. (And she agreed.)If you want a fun superhero show that's more exciting than Super Friends, try Kim Possible. After that, try the Teen Titans DVDs, which do have shooting, but it's very unrealistic (e.g., energy bolts flying out of someone's hands)."
3,not bad,"i was orginally going to write a very negative review. but thats probably unwarranted in hindsight. as the season progresses, it definitely gets better, with some big storylines developing. but be warned: there are some real duds in the season. the introduction of comedy and more dc characters is definitely a negative.a lot of people seem to think the unlimited seasons are far better than previous seasons. but as in most comic to screen adaptions, i think too many characters and/or villians 'spoils the broth' (spider-man 3 is a perfect example). the comedy doesnt really work either. the previous seasons were great for drama and action. but we are now left with less of that given the show must make way for comedy and lighter episodes. saying that, when the drama/action episodes do come up, they are done with the usual skill and perfection.on a whole, i wouldnt rate the previous seasons below the unlimited relaunch."
2,Not as groundbreaking as it seems,"I do love the idea and the characters, but, unfortunately this season delivers predictable stories with mediocre animation. Action scenes are tiresome and VERY repetitive instead of more character development, but not enough which is so unfortunate. The producers struggled to keep the audience interested and alas failed time and time again. I am pleased this series eventually came to an end, but really recommend that if you needed to choose ONE Justice League DVD then pick the previous Justice League first season DVD set which far surpass this mindless season. It appears that in JLU, most episodes are designed to showcase the many DC Universe stars and sacrifice GOOD story telling in the process. Justice League Unlimited does have its limits after all."
4,pressure washer,"I've used it 4 times now for over 3 hours. It's light and portable enough for me to roll, lift, set up. It took some paint along with the dirt off the cedar clapboards, and lifted a few splinters of wood when I got the nozzle too close, so I'm using it more carefully. It's also great for cleaning area rugs and carpet. First I soak the rug with Oxyclean solution, let it sit for an hour ( outside on the patio ) then pressure wash from the middle out right side up then from the back. Rinse until the bubbles are gone then dry in the air. Really clean and much less work than a shampooer.It was used and came with no instructions, so at first it appeared broken. You have to release water through the nozzle for the motor to turn on. It was the third thing I checked out, after the water supply and the reset buttons on the power cord. I'm cleaning my mother's vinyl siding next."
3,"Not bad, but design could be better","I've had the K3.67 for over 3 years. When I bought it,I opened the box & it had a broken wheel. Karcher replaced it quickly. The replacement leaked at the water hose input. They replaced it again, no problem either time. The unit has worked good since, especially with the T-Racer attached. The design is poor - no place to store hose while using it, also, water input & high pressure hose attachments are too close to the base, so you invariably scrape your knuckles when attaching & detaching."
1,WORST service EVER: STAY AWAY,"I wish I had read the reviews that were here before my purchase. Karcher is absolutely the worst in product quality and service. I have been waiting to post this review in hopes that they would help me, but they hit my limit of 10 customer service contacts with no resolution. I told them I would be posting negative reviews but they don't seem to care (and if they do fix my situation I will gladly update this review). In short, the unit was DAMAGED in the box when it arrived (cracked housing -- same complaint as other people here). The box wasn't damaged, so it was obviously shipped that way. Their website talks about easy replacement warranty but like the other victims here I have contacted them 10 times and they keep giving me the run-around. I am now disputing the charge. My advice: STAY AWAY."
1,junk,"Only used few times, 1st I repalced the gun (1/3 of the whole unit), worked few months. Later replaced a pump part, and worked for few months. Now it's totally dead. how many hrs did I spend to fix this myself? Not worth itnevr buy any electtric pressure washer made by this Karcher. made in German, so what? Totally pissed off"
1,I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER KARCHER,"this is my second karcher pressure washer in about 4 years. the first one lasted about 2 years with average use around the house. it gradually stopped working. i bought the new one about 1 1/2 years ago (swearing to myself that i would never buy another karcher) and this one stopped working after minimal use.i will try customer service but i dont expect much being that it is out of warranty. seriously, what good is a pressure washer that you use once or twice a month and it doesnt even last 2 years?"
1,Beware: parts may be unavailable,"Neither the manufacturer nor the retailer stock replacement parts for these units. If it fails in the warranty period (three months), they replace the whole thing. When I accidentally stripped the threads on the inlet hose connection I went to Karcher for a replacement. They sent me to two companies that supply spare parts. Neither had the part, even though it showed up in Karcher's thorough online parts list. They couldn't get it from Karcher either. No explanation, except that Karcher showed a list price of $60 for the unobtainable part and that seemed more than anyone would pay."
1,Unreliable,Our second Karcher pressure washer has bit the dust in a 4 year period. The pump broke on both of them. I do not recommend purchasing a Karcher pressure washer.
1,requires continual attention,after purchasing the Karcher power wash system I repared 2 leaks in the connections with the teflon tape. I found that I had to rebuild or re-engineer hose and wand connections continually to stop leaks and keep the unit working. After calls and emails to customer service I never got anything replaced. This product was a waste of time and money.
4,Karcher Work Horse,I gave this Karcher four star instead of five because I actually purchased the model K 3.68 from a local Lowes for less money and it provides eighteen hundred pounds of pressure. That extra fifty for less money is a no brainer. It deep cleaned all the concrete around the house including a very filthy driveway. The Karcher replaces a failed Campbell Hausfeld that no replacement parts are available for. The Karcher out performs anything in it's price range. Look for the Karcher #K3.68M at Lowes.
2,Did not last as long it should,"I purchased this in October 2008. I used this lightly - about 2 to 3 times a year - to wash out the air cons, underwash the cars and clean the walkways of moss. Alas, today (15 Aug, 2012) I was doing one of the cars and it stopped working and gave off a burning smell. The unit itself did a good job on cleaning but in terms of longevity I am unhappy. I am giving 2 stars because power tool like this should not have such a short life. I never mistreated the unit and it was always properly stored. Having purchased additionl attachments for the unit I am now faced with if to go with this brand again or cut my losses and go with another brand."
1,Waste of Money,"I wash my deck once a yr. I've had this for 2 yrs, and a plastic piece cracked. I had the K3.79M model. Wand started leaking from the handle. Finding a replacement elbow was next to impossible. Its out of warranty. I could have bought a replacement wand for about $50, but decided not to waste my money on any Karcher parts. Too many negative reviews about their customer service and poor parts quality."
2,BUYER BE AWARE,"I'm bothering to write this as i found the reviews of others helpful. I own a Karcher residential electric model. As said: when they work they are great, BUT you simply are not going to get over 1500 psi for $200-300 from any model, any manufacturer. We use this machine occasionally and based on our experience if you own one, you are going to have to fix it regularly. There is a wealth of sites that sell parts for these things, and offer excellent advice. The incredible availability of parts tells you something. If you have the patience and ability to make the repairs (these machines fairly well designed for this) and don't want to spend close to $1k for a power washer these machines will ""work"" for you. They are like espresso machines- you are not going to get trouble free operation with high pressure and plastic parts for under $1k. Good luck, you have been warned."
1,JUNK Beware,"I purchased one of these, used it about 5 times within a year. Then the hose connections broke, plastic crack or something. Out of warranty, bought another, the hose unit broke, took it apart, same thing broken, cracked plastic.Bottom line is there is some decent pressure that comes out of these when they work, but its that same pressure that breaks the cheap plastic parts that much of the thing is made of. Getting some parts is possible, like a whole new wand, but its funny how it cost more than 50% of the total cost of a new one. So you have to say, just buy a replacement part or a whole new one, knowing how cheap they are made.I am a casual user of a pressure washer, but I will not be buying a third one of these. Yes they are relatively inexpensive, but if you have to buy a new one every few months to a year, what do you have after 3 years?"
3,Book makes locating hard-to-find waterfalls easy,"This book does a great job of giving detailed maps and directions to some waterfalls that are very remote and obscure (as well as some that aren't). The author, a former surveyor, is very precise with his descriptions with milages accurate to .05 miles. The chief drawbacks are a lack of commentary and information on the fauna and flora of the region and a complex identification system that becomes rather cumbersome. Overall, an excellent catelog of some of the prettiest waterfalls in the region."
4,Classic first-hand description of the Abdul-Hamid Massacres,"Although this book is written in a 19th century style with fanciful language and some non-politically correct notions of Turks, it is nonetheless a vital primary account and time period piece concerning the 1894-96 massacres of 200,000-300,000 Armenian Christians. This vivid account, written in 1896 by an American, some twenty years before the Armenian Genocide of 1915, is an invaluable historical document explaining the condition of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, and the general attitude of the Turks towards the Armenians. Thus describing the pre-cursor to the later Genocide, this book is a must read for the uninformed and any revisionists who still argue that the wholesale, planned massacres of Armenians never took place."
2,A Christian perception against a Muslim Nation,"Well although the book is well written like a ""Tales from the Crypt"" screenplay. It does no more than promoting hatred one against another. Details are too well described to be taken seriously. It seemed like the author actually video taped the events and watched before writing this book. By all means, if you have time and do not like Turks or Muslims, buy it."
1,Groundhog Day,"What a disappointing song.Doesnt do justice to the great cause which it propagates. Of course Wyclef and Bono are names big enough to rise back up to the crest of the wave, but songs like this doesnt help their cause. the beat, well, you wouldnt notice it playing in a lift, the lyrics are tacky by Wyclef and self-indulgent by Bono. the token chorus of childrens voices at the end only adds an iota of humanity and poppy-catchiness to the song, but otherwise nondescript and for seasoned Wyclef/Bono fans only"
3,A good device for a test-taker!,"This is a good machine if you want to use it to increase your vocabularies especially for anyone who is going to take SAT because it contains a lot of tests like analogies, synonyms, antonyms, etc. It's very boring if you have to use flashcards or do the tests in the books or even on computer all the time. You can carry this one with you and play with it on the way to school or any where. However, it is a bad electronic dictionary because it doesn't contain a lot of vocabularies. So it really depends on your purposes. If you want to have a decent pocket-electronic dictionary, I recommend you to look for ""bookman from franklin"" instead."
3,somewhat,I was told that I was gonna receive an FM antenna together with this product but I never saw anything. The sound is very good. The DVD player is Picky it doesn't play all my DVD CDs and Audio CDs as well!But the sound system is Really good.
3,Nice little Mini-Theater --- Minus the THEATER --- DVD's/CDs won't play,"Great little unit. Nice size, appearance. Beautiful sound all at the right price. Have had this for a couple years now, but major issues with disc play.When it was new it work well, but soon (weeks) it would begin to hang up while playing DVDs. At first just a little, then more and more. The the point where you had to restart your movie every 30mins if you wanted it to continue - Finally bought a different DVD player! Playing audio CDs is hit and miss. Also, I did exchange it at Sam's Club and the replacement unit did the exact same thing. At this point, if I try to put a DVD in, it won't even load the disc. It may take 1-2 mins for it to figure out that it's a DVD and then MAYBE start playing..Hope fully the updated versions of this are more useful - maybe the MCD708 or something - but this is a glorified Radio for me!"
1,Like your sound? Look elsewhere!,"I received this stereo as a replacement for a very old Panasonic micro system. I run an Internet radio station, so I use my desktop stereo constantly. This stereo came with a partially-functional remote, so you can't access any menus or control the setup. Don't EVER lose or break the remote or the stereo is useless.This stereo has a very strange automatic level control built in. I could find no way to turn off this ""feature"". It processes all audio going through it (even CD) and adds WAY too much stereo compression (apparently in an attempt to make DVDs sound like they are playing on a larger system). This makes for a terrible sounding unit that makes every music source sound like boomy analog FM radio.This stereo looks fantastic, but if you like your stereo to actually sound good, do NOT purchase this unit."
2,DVD gets stuck,Dont BUY.I bought this product a month back from amazon reseller. Audio (CD/mp3) works fine. But it cannot play DVDs very well. Every 2 to 3 mins it is stuck reading the DVD.
1,Crap,"I bought this unit about a year ago using it as a home theater system. The sound is ok, but after a few month's use the dvd cd door jammed rendering play back inoperable. I mainly use it now as a radio/receiver for another Phillips multi region dvd player connected to my hdtv. It functions ok for that. Another case of form over substance- it looks nice but was a waste of money. Now in the market for a decent reciever with out the extra dvd/cd included."
1,Poor quality,"I have a few other Air Dog toys which both my dogs love (donut-shaped and bone) and have lasted for quite some time. Already familiar with this brand, I expected a quality product. My shepherd chewed off a corner of the jack within minutes of receiving this toy, and the broken bits cut her gums. Very poor quality. Also, the picture does not give a context for size. Though labeled ""medium"" I would better classify this toy as ""small."" I thought it might be similar to the Petstages Orka Jack Chew Toy (available on amazon), which both my dogs love and has lasted forever. I recommend buying the Orka if you want a similar-shaped, durable toy for your hard chewers."
1,Doesn't hold up,It just didn't hold up. Lasted about a day before all the fingers were chewed off. Very disappointed with it and I think people should save their money and buy something else.
2,Can't judge based on 5 minutes,Our 10 month old retriever tore it to shreds in 5 minutes. Not sturdy for a strong chewer. He has not destroyed any of his Kong toys. We will have to stick with those.
3,Eaten by Apollo !,"Great Kong toy in the tennis ball mode. That said, don't ever leave it with my 95 pound Lab, Apollo. When I left the room for 5 minutes I returned to a destroyed toy. I realize it is an interactive toy so don't make the same mistake I did and leave the area. He has the Kong tennis football which he absolutely adores!!! He can't sink his teeth into that.....yet."
5,fun toy for dog,"My 4 month old puppy loved this toy. Unfortunately the squeaker in it died within a few minutes, but it could have just been a bit of a dud. I would still get this without the squeaker in it anyway. She loved chasing it around as it bounced in all directions. I would think it to be something more of a fetch toy, and not so much for a teething puppy as she did go through it within a week."
4,Love this toy,My dog loves this toy due to the shape and the squeak. However this toy has not proved to be totally indistructable.
2,Disappointed with this.,This definitely did not live up to the kong toughness I'm used to. My youngest english bulldog had this thing in pieces the first night it was given to him.
1,Dog destroyed in literally one minute.,"My dog loves the traditional Kongs where you can put food or peanut butter in for them to play with, so I thought she would like this. She had chewed off the ends in literally one minute and I had to throw it away. I have a call in to The Kong Company to complain."
1,Kong Air Dog Squeaker Jack,My Collie doesn't like this toy and has only ever had it out of her toy box once and then it just sat on the floor. Would not recommend it to anyone else.
2,Not for real chewers,"I thought this would be a good chew toy for my dog (lab/ridgeback mix). She tore the squeaker out within minutes and within a few days had chewed down each side to a nub. Good concept (she loved it till I tossed it), but not durable enough for chewers."
2,not completley unsatisfied,"My dog destroyed this in about 10 minutes. She chewed off two of its arms, but still gets some enjoyment out of it mangled remains."
1,Only for dogs that aren't out to destroy toys!,"My dog only enjoys toys with squeakers in them. Once the squeaker is gone, the toy has no more attraction. I thought that the construction of this toy would impede the loss of the squeaker. Not so. Unfortunately my dog didn't even have to destroy the toy to destroy the squeaker. He almost immediately put a canine through the toy and through the squeaker. Then he lost interest. My low rating applies to my dog's experience with the toy. Dogs who don't immediately think squeaker means KILL ;) might get great enjoyment out of it. It is tennis ball type material, well made, fun to bounce, and would be great for both fetch and tug if squeakers aren't important to your dog."
2,music in studio,"The music contents is beautiful but is made up in a studio, a very easy way for white ""musicians"" to travel in Africa an taping music."
2,My Opinion,I'm really disappointed in this one but maybe it's just me. I'm am going to pass it on and see if someone else May like it
2,"Great product, but not finished well","While this changing table is a great size, appears to be very stable, and is attractively made, the finish is much darker and shinier than the picture portrayed it to be. Also, in may places, it had not been properly sanded, and was rough to the touch. Also, I didn't realize that the boards were not actual wood. If you were willing to paint it, I think it would look great; otherwise, it's kinda ""cheapy""."
3,Fancy Trail Mix,The product was fresh and well packed. Too many raisins and not enough nuts and seeds for my taste.
4,A MUST!! for Digital Cameras,I recently purchased the Olympus 3000 digital camera. It eats batteries like crazy! Rechargeables are a MUST if you are using a digital camera. My camera uses 4 AA batteries but came with disposables. I purchased 8 rechargeable batteries so I always have a ready set. Now I feel like I can use the camera as much as I like without worrying if the batteries will bug out in the middle of the day.
4,Charging time,"If anyone out there uses this charger, and wouldnt mind answering a question. It would be much Appr. I need to know how long to charge batteries with this charger. There was no instruction... Help!"
5,Great product,"These batteries work wonderfully in my flash. Flash recycles fast, lots of pics before recharging. Much better than the lower mA batteries. However, wouldn't power a digital camera I borrowed for a w/e, whereas a couple fresh DuraCells (nonrechargable) did.Also use em to power other battery eaters, such as my eTrex GPS. Feel I get decent service from the batteries.Definitely plan to get another set when these die."
5,Nature's Way Super Thisilyn,"I have been taking this product for a couple of years now. It is a wonderful product to help keep your liver happy. We live in a toxic world...air, water, food...this product helps the liver cleanse itself. Amazon has the best prices."
2,Colorful but lacking in substance,"This book should please those who are looking for a colorful book to keep high school students interested in what many might consider a dry subject. It covers a host of topics and issues and will lead students to think. However, it is marred by its appalling ignorance of economic analysis. The worst example is in Chapter 2 where it offers up some comments on the ""idea of profit maximization"". Any student who has had a principles course in economics is likely to see these comments for what they are, namely the kind of rhetoric one would expect from someone manning one of the ubiquitous anti-globalization tables at a large university."
3,Law for Business,I needed this textbook to complete my college courses. It's a very good textbook for introduction to Business Law. I got it at a very good price but it was in an extremely used condition. Will rethink paying little or nothing again before I make another purchase. The book however shipped out on time and I was quite pleased with the shipping company.
3,Where are the minorities?,"I bought this for my daughter before her younger brother was born. It's very cute and comes with a lot of realistic accessories so she can play right along side me. However, the one thing that I noticed right away is that there is absolutely no diversity with this doll. I have had this doll for about 2 years, so the product has been out at least that long, and there is still, to my knowledge, no ethnic diversity. It is not hard to pour in a different colored plastic into the same mold and use brown eye stickers. I am definitely beginning to question underlying motives with Graco. It should not have taken this long to come out with more races. I am going to look into it further, but there was no information on the Graco site as to how long the doll has been out. They for a long time have only produced baby products, and have done a great job, but where are the minorities?"
5,Fabulous from beginning to end!,"I read this book to my fifth grade students every year when school starts as an introduction to our year-long monarch butterfly project. Every time I get to the end of the story where the butterfly (Danaus) lays her last eggs I get choked up and have to blink back a tear--so do my students. This book really opened my eyes to the struggle and the hardships a species will endure to ensure survival of that species, not to mention the incredible instinctive traits these butterflies exhibit."
1,This Video is not GOOD,This video is nothing that I expected. I expected there to be awesome crahes but instead it showed bikes riding accross the lawn. I do not recommend it.
2,A Disappointment,"L.J. Smith's books are getting redundant now-n-days and predictable. Though Witchlight was a nice change then just vampires and witches, I was bored reading it and getting terribly tired of the whole soulmate business. I think she should wrap up this Night World series and go back to her trilogies."
5,Witch Light is FINALLY here!,I am giving this book a ten based on my waiting period. I haven't read it but am buying it tonight. I have been waiting for this book since I finished Black Dawn on it's release. I'm definitly going to write a review on this book as soon as I finish it. I know it will please me and L. J. Smith won't let this devoted fan! So like always I really like it when other fans of L. J. Smith's books write me. So fell free to! =)
4,pah,"this wasn't bad. the fights were good, I liked Iliana well enough, but i think the soul mate principal is defintely getting a little old, esp. with the ""oh no, i love him but he can't be mine"" thing constantly going on. i don't care if that's what she wants to stress, i don't have to like it & i really really do not. but to each their own."
4,Good but......,"This series got off to a slow start but picked up midway with book 2, ""Daughters of Darkness"" and tapered off with book 7, ""Huntress."" InDecember 1997 book 10, ""Witchlight"" came out and the book gave the feeling that something big was coming. That this was really just the beginning. It's shame we never get to it.We haven't seen a book from L.J. Smith since. It's been almost 5 years and I have feeling we won't be seeing the installment in the series anytime soon. After having to wait this long the momentum is just... GONE. LOST.I advise to read any of her trilogies that start & finish, if you don't want to be left hanging. ""Dark Visions,"" ""The Forbidden Game,"" & ""The Secret Circle."" Plus the 4 parter ""Vampire Diaries."""
2,OMIGAWD!!!! She's just the BEST!!!!!!,Lisa Jane Smith's been pretty good at the soulmate thingy and all but its really starting to wear thin.. Naturally everyone's entitled to their own opinion but I think that the perfect tens in a row you people give her books are a little too unbelievable.. C'mon.. Lisa really needs new creativity in her storylines.. and it doesn't really help that everyone keeps gushing about how fantastic her tired old plots are.. And for the first time I actually see a few ones or twos as a rating.. my respects to you all.. MAY WE ALL STAND IN UNITY!! *g* Since there's probably gonna be some really indignant and mortally offended replies..
3,"Same old story, different people","Well it is pretty unlikely that people who don't even know each other keep falling in love just by touching each other. Also why do all the shapeshifters, vampires and witches have to have *unearthly* beauty? It won't kill L.J. Smith to have an ordinary looking night worlder once in a while! Another point is that can't people fallin love without being soul mates? But nooo they'll only fall in love if they are. And why do all the *evil* vampires seem to become goody goody after finding their human soulmates? Get real!"
5,LJ Smith is THE Goddess.....,"She can definitely write, this woman. What can I say about the soulmate principle and the fact that someone in the story, who would (obviously) be gorgeous and strong and would find a soulmate who is just completely gorgeous and strong (him/herself) except that this is her book and she can write it anyway she wants to. Hah! At least the storyline changes, there are always some surprises and it's very entertaining. I agree with the reader who said that maybe Lisa is trying to stress a point with that principle. I would like to read something about werewolves though because let's face it, the way she writes about werewolves kind of makes them out to be very stupid. And maybe something more about Ash and Mary-Lynette. Maybe they can meet again sometime soon. I'm also very eager to read about what would happen in the Millenium or after they've found the 4th and last Wild Power. To LJ Smith, I say well done and you ARE the Goddess of horror/romance books."
2,Giggle!,"Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!!!! Oh that soulmate guy Illiana is soooo cute!!! I wish I could run away with him, unlike mundane reality, where nothing like this happens!!!! Get real. This book is too Disney-esque. For once, I would like to see an unhappy ending; i.e. the soulmate dies. Like Tolstoy said, ""All happy endings are the same, but unhappy endings are unhappy in their own way."" =)"
5,One word-COOL!!!,"I liked the book!! L. J. Smith writes the coolest books!! I have some, but I hope to get them all!! The characters are cool!! The stories are awesome!!!"
5,This book is great!,This book is brillantly wrote. I loved how Keller and Galen were brought together. I hope that they are used in future books.
1,Old news,"I must say even though she been developing the idea of the Wild Powers, GET REAL! It's old, boring, it's getting out of hand with this soulmate thing. The series should have ended a long time ago! End it now with a book where Circle Daybreak goes off on some mission, where a couple people get killed, WHERE IT'S NOT THEY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER FOR EVERYONE!!!"
1,"Blah, blah, blah...","Good Lord, nothing like aped tripe to ruin your idealistic view on the ""creative"" writing industry. Ms. Smith has recycled her Elena character again like Kevin Costner recycled his loner character in a choatic world. Of course she meets her match and her match , of course, are under twenty years of age and of course, they are as good looking as hell. So what's new folks? Her prose is getting more and more lenient towards Harlequin paperbacks. In her effort to appeal to a mass audience, she has failed to write some quality work with soul. People, if you want to find out about the ""soulmate principle"", then go read ""Wuthering Heights,"" where it probably all started this odd boom. Or some Plato. And the illustrator should stop using the Hanson brothers as his/her model."
5,Wonderful!,"I read this book at least six times. I've read most of L.J.Smith's books and i have to say that this was one of my favorites! I love it when Illiana gets mad. She is such a blond ditz, which makes the ending great. I won't spoil it. I can't wait till ""Strange Fate"" comes out. What happened? I was tracking it here and all of a sudden all the records for it disappeared, i can't even see the date when it is supposed to come out!"
5,Great book - where's the rest of the series?,"In response to the Nov. 4 review, I have been bugging the publisher about every 6 months about Strange Fate and just did so again. As of now, Simon and Shuster have no information on the publication of Strange Fate, so unless there is another publisher that has picked it up, we're still waiting. Too bad. All the other Night World series end of their own accord, and so does Witchlight, but it leaves you really thirsting for the final book and the resolution to the prophesy.LJ Smith is an excellent author that can draw you into her stories and characters and into that other, mythical world, Night World."
5,Witchlight is a fantastic book!,Witchlight was a great book. I loved the chemistry between Keller and Galen.. they seemed absolutely perfect for each other! i loveddddd the ending to. I love all of L. J. Smiths books especially the Night World Series But im still trying to complete my collection though. so If you can help me find the rest of her Night World Books....
5,"Hey, when is the next Night World coming out?","Fantastic! I loved the entire book series and this one is just great! I was just wondering: when is the next one coming out, if it hasn't come out yet? Please give me an answer as soon as possible. Thank you!"
4,"Not the best to Start with, but....","This might not be the best Homer Kelly mystery to start with, but it is definitely worth reading if you like the series. Most of the Homer Kelly books take place in Boston; occassionally on another site, such as Florence (the Dante Game) and Oxford (the Longest Day). Unlike the previous reviewer, I did not find ANY of the Boston books boring. This one, that takes place in Venice, is a great introduction to the city. And Mary Kelly is more of the main character than Homer. But for those of us who have READ EVERY ONE, it was interesting to see Mary in a foreign city and the danger she finds herself in. Perhaps not the best, but a very good look at Venice and to an extent, Medieval art."
2,Forget Homer - it's a Mary Kelly Mystery,"I began to think that Langton sat with a map of Venice to write her story and name-drop places. I really think this book was not well written, badly proofread and why was it necessary to use all that profanity? If it weren't for the Venice setting it would be as dull as her Boston books."
3,Time for an update,"This is the kind of resource we treasure when we're on the road, and we're grateful to have it. This is just a note to urge the author to put out a revised edition, perhaps with distinctions about whether a given locale includes Raw, Vegan, Organic, and/or Ovolacto vegetarian. Yes, we're picky eaters when we get to this part of the spectrum. Dine in or deli? Sometimes we found the listings in the original edition lacking details and ended up in a store with no produce, just whole grain bread. Is this a restaurant, a health food (vitamin) shop, or a grocery? Do they sell fresh produce, sprouts, or make fresh raw juices or smoothies? Those are the kinds of things we watch for now. Couldn't always tell, though in general the book is good about indicating so. Cafe Gratitude (SF area) and Blossoming Lotus (Portland) are good adds. Thanks!"
4,A review from a parent,"I have three children, who range in ages 3-6. I bought a Furby for each child because they felt they couldn't LIVE without one! They have been entranced with their Furbys since day one! My eldest daughter is very motherly to her Furby, while my 3 year old son has great fun talking to his and hearing it talk back to him! It is beneficial for children to actually comprehend that language has to be learned...and to see them teaching their Furbys is wonderful. The kids get to be a parent and a teacher to these toys. I highly recommend these for children. Each Furby has it's own personality, which is cool...they are not all alike! And the on/off switch is a bonus!!"
5,Furby fun,"I got my white furby about 3 days ago. I almost got the grey and pink one, but I didn`t know what the color patern looked like in real life.Later I`ll buy it if it isn`t too girly(no offence).At first it only spoke furbish. The more time you spend with it the faster it learns english. The best part is it recognizes your vioce ,but won`t wake up. Another thing is it has an off switch which makes it more accepted by parents unlike the last kind. Here is an example of the furbish language.Some furbys are doo-loo (funny), some are wah-lah (wise),some are dah-boh-bay (scared) or even koh-koh doo-ay (more fun)."
4,Okay,"This toy is fun at first. When Hasbro deliverd it to me i was SO(...) Happy. But after awhile my brother was right, it got SO(...) annoying [and I do not plan to]I have not played with it in a while."
2,Got Batterys?,"Everything about my grand daughter's furby was great except that it stopped working after about 2 months. We changed batteries several times and got only temporary relief. I don't know if this is a heridetary problem with furbys of if our furby is simply disabled and in need of special training. Either way, it is out of order way too soon."
4,my son,I purchased a black one for my son. It is hard to review just yet b/c it's a Christmas present. But compared to the ones from years ago these are amazing. I will add more if possible after my son plays w/ it
5,HAVE TO GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is so cool!!The original furby was so small and it did not respond to you like the new furby!I got a furby last week!When i saw it at the store it was so cute, i had to have it!And it is only $20.00!It uset to be $44.99!When i got home and opened it i turned it on and it sarted talking to me right away.When i fed it, it was more fun!!You so have to get one!You dont know what you are missing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,My new best friend,He is so cute! He giggles and laughs and is overall a cute toy. I got mine at toysrus for only 24.99! great deal. I love this toy and think you should get one two. he is a grat toy for kids/teens up to 14 then I would draw the line.
1,fall of a writer,"I really liked Burke's writing when he first became popular. But in his later books he has spun down an ever decreasing corkscrew of vacuous ""spirituality"" and prissiness, combined with exceedingly vicious and sadistic scenes of violence. It's hard to write a book with no appealing characters; Burke has come close to succeeding with Heartwood. Even the protagonist is someone you would take pains to stay away from. The plot depends on the ""visions"" of a blind character, as if the author can't figure out how to move things along without the proverbial ""and then a miracle happened.""I really wish James Lee Burke would come back again, and start writing."
2,Small Town Life?,"Every couple of years, I pick up a James Lee Burke novel because I really want to like the guy. He's capable of portraying a terrific sense of place...whether the Louisiana bayou or the Texas hill country, you can feel the atmosphere, smell the smells, see the country. What an extrordinary gift.On the other hand, his plots reel from one act of gratuitous violence to another. I found my stomach tightening everytime Chub, Cholo, or Jeff got in their cars. Poking out somebody's eye is no big deal. No wonder Temple Carol spends her spare time practicing boxing and perfecting her karate kick. I wondered how anyone ever got any sleep, as it was perfectly possible his front door would be kicked in, his women raped and their children sold into slavery by any one of a number of trios of cro-magnons he might have offended by the color of his tie or the cut of his jib. At least, most of the good guys are left standing, but I fear only to fight another day."
4,Strong Burke story with minimal echoes of previous works.,"Burke delivers his usual tragic, social comment on past and present-day moral problems and dilemnas. The echoes to previous works are stronger than usual because we are now reading more of his works and unconsciously mentally reinforcing his style from our past recollections. Burke fans will have no problems gobbling up this morsel. Like previous repasts of the mind, a second or third helping does not dull the palate!"
2,Stick with Robicheaux,Billy Bob is a weak second to Dave R. and while the descriptions of Texas country are typical excellent prose by James Lee Burke it doesn't match the Bayou of LA. The book could be 100 pages shorter and still finished the story. Can't wait for another Dave R. Book.
4,Good Vacation Read,"No one can describe the slant of light reflecting on the water or the metalic clouds in the distant sky like Burke. Whether the setting is Texas or Louisianna, he is clearly in touch with the land and the people. The dialogue is crisp and true. Yes, the themes and people in this story seem a bit familiar, but the action and the characters are well drawn and mostly credible. I have enjoyed most of the Robicheaux series and also liked Cimarron Rose. (My wife thinks Burke is too violent for her tastes.) I guess I just enjoy reading Burke's writing, and, as usual, he gives us a good story. I must acknowledge that the mystical devices (e.g., conversations with ghosts) tend to break the flow for me. It's annoying to be reminded that you are reading a book. If you are a Burke fan you will not be disappointed."
3,rainy rainy Texas,"When author Burke moved his stories from the Louisiana coastlands to the hillcountry of Texas, he brought Louisiana weather with him. In this somewhat rambling (where was the editor?) story, the occasions of rain in the Texas hill country became so frequent, I began to note them. There are references to rain on pp. 18, 24, 55, 62. 91. 99. 139. 140. 145. 156. 175. 201. 210, 214, 215, 217, 219, 230, 240, 281, 283, 298, 312 and 318. Has Mr. Burke ever lived through a summer in the hill country? And does he realize that he has three separate characters say disparagingly of someone, ""His (your) s--t doesn't flush""? HEARTWOOD certainly beat watching the sitcoms on a (dry) Texas night, but it isn't up to the Dave Robicheaux stories."
2,Billy Bob & Dave Robicheaux never seem to grow-up,"JLBurke has this ugly habit of making his main characters, Dave Robicheaux and now Billy Bob Holland, sexual saps (googoogahgah) for women they have bedded in the past. I find this tiresome. Billy Bob & Dave never seem to grow up. They remain sexually shallow pion brains. And being as half the story revolves around this drivel half the story is a waste.The story itself is the same old same old, the rich abusing/getting over on the non-rich. All the cops are on the ""pad"", etc. Nothing new."
2,Same old ingredients/talented writing,"This effort by Mr. Burke presents the same character types as most of the previous Robicheaux/Holland novels...Bad rich guys with vulnerable trophy wives... affecting, precocious child, abused losers and corrupt lawmen all revolving around the main character with a good heart, haunted past and occasional uncontrolled rage. The writing itself is great but I wish Burke would tighten up the story so it doesn't seem like your watching an endless slide show of someone's vacation."
3,a little cheesy,But worth reading. I enjoy Burke and found Billy Bob more interesting in the further west setting later in life.
4,Heartwood,"In your youthful travels did you ever accidentally walk into a biker bar and everything went silent? You asked yourself, ""Do I keep on walking in, or do I turn and slowly walk out and risk that the silence will turn into a peppering of insults and taunts?""Heartwood will have you traveling in Texas with some very mean and cowardly people in a position of power and whose love of money is second nature. These socially prominent country clubbers are not afraid of doing the wet work. They are not the polished smoothies that cheat but draw the line; these folks bully and then distance themselves from the violence they create. They are sociopaths motivated by avarice and greed, empowered by inherited wealth, entitlement, and enough political corruption to influence some members of the police department, and control much of the small town they live in.Burke will have you revisiting that helpless feeling you experienced in the biker bar."
3,Billy Bob Holland helps an innocent man prove his innocence.,"James Lee Burke is one of my favorite writers, but it is now as a result of his vivid descriptions of his enviroment rather than his stories. Much as I hate to say it, Mr. Burke feels to me as though he is telling the same story over and over again, be the protagonist Billy Bob Holland or Dave Ropbucheau. There is always the polarities of people, many of whom seem to be more and more violent with each new book. I DO like Billy Bob/Dave's interaction with children. We need to see a soft side of the ""heros"". I will conti ue to read Burke, indeed even in hardback, in hopes of some day finding the great kick I got out of his earlier books."
1,Tired characters and a long long long long story,"As an avid reader this book disapointed me beyond belief. It is the first time I have had to force myself to finish a book in a long time. The book could have been more than 100 pages shorter and might have been better. The descriptions of places were good but there seemed to be to many characters added in to just take up space. All of the jumping around also made it hard to keep interested in the story. The old partner popping up periocically I found to be annoying. I hope that the author doesn't read these but, then again I will probably not seek his work out again in the future."
3,Can't relate to a 'hero' named Billy Bob,"I have been a big James Lee Burke fan for years, but after reading the first two books in this new series I have to say that I am really disappointed. What we have in this book is all the stiffness and aloofness of Dave R but none of the charm or local color of those Louisiana stories. This is an ugly location, an ugly story, and ugly characters to boot.Besides, I just can't relate to a 'hero' named Billy Bob."
4,"GOOD WRITING, BUT THE CHARACTERS WERE A LITTLE TIRED...","I finished ""Heartwood"" about a week ago, and while Burke's writing of almost lyrical prose was well in order, the novel just didn't touch me or stay in my mind like some of his other works. Maybe it's because I've read so many of his books that all the characters are begining to seem alike. You can only warm over the same old plot lines and archetypes so many times before it gets old."
2,NOT YOUR TYPICAL 'JAMES LEE BURKE' OFFERING,"I did not put much stock in several of the reviews in Amazon.com but now realize I was wrong. Mr. Burke, I believe, is trying to create another character with the charisma of Robicheau, who communes with his deceased partner, but he has failed miserably. Without dragging this out too far, I will just say I was sorely disappointed. Mr. Burke kept on writing this book, however, in my humble opinion, never had a plot worthy of being built upon. Also, I don't believe small town lawyers have the time to ride all over the countryside on a horse, and no one but Michael Jackson hangs out with someone else's kids. This character and his cohorts should be quickly put to rest and lets hope Mr Burke revives ""old dave"". This is really not worth the money. Is he facing ""burnout""?"
2,Get An Editor!,"Everybody in this book gives off a smell--our Billy Bob computes the subtleties of body odors even as he deals with life-and-death matters. And then we're told not once, but maybe a hundred times, that he drives an Avalon. It's ""my Avalon this,"" ""my Avalon that."" James Lee Burke apparently thinks the word ""car"" is too ordinary for his main man. Or is he getting money from Toyota or what? As with the Robicheaux books, this character has a doppelganger--but it's a more effective touch in Robicheaux's Louisiana, where you expect this kind of superheated spiritualist-medium stuff. One thing the book helps make clear, though: if characters like this do live in Texas, no wonder George W. signed that law saying it's okay to carry guns into churches. Shooting characters like these would be a sacrament. This book gives off a distinctive smell, too: of warmed-over leftovers awash in catsup."
1,Nonsense!,"I am just starting this book its a requirement for the school that I am attending. In the book he talks about Weston Price, and how cultures that consumed traditional diets containing whole, unprocessed foods had low rates of chronic disease. Then he goes on to recommend low-fat dairy which is homogenized and pasteurized. What really bothers me is that he recommends soy bacon, soy sausage, and soy hot dogs. I don't know about you but don't those sound like highly processed foods? He also recommends canola oil. This guy is a joke!"
4,Huge & Helpful,"This is a great book to have on hand. While I was quite optimistic, I figured I'd still give it a shot. Amazingly enough, several things really do help! I certainly wouldn't buy this book expecting a cure for all ailments, however, it carries a lot of good information that can assist you for simple things (nausea for example). I use this as a booster for my medical care rather than a book to self-treat.It's something I imagine many will enjoy, especially people who own older Old Wives Tales books or Home Remedy books. It is great for home remedies!"
5,"Clear, descriptive, and super helpful book!","Wonderful to have as a resource for what we are eating on an everyday basis. Love this book! I have recommended it to many, and as a nutrition major, I have to say it is a must-buy for anyone who wants to learn more about food and wellness."
1,Wrong Stance on Important Topic,"Dr. Murray condons the use of Sucralose and Asparatame, pg 45. There is so much scientific data showing how harmful these pervasive substances are, it is unconscionable to approve their use in ANY way.There is good info in this book. I can't say I've perused the whole book."
3,"Great book, but not new.",The book itself is wonderful and so helpful when it comes to your eating habits and lifestyle and gives excellent advice on what to eat for what ailments as well as prevention. But I paid more to buy a new book and this one is clearly used because it's dirty and looks worn. Very disappointed when it comes to accuracy of what I thought I was buying.
5,Very Imformative,This book has all types of information about what foods and beneficial for. A must have in every home in order to eat for health.
4,Don't hate the game...hate the player....,"This star of this movie is unequivocably J.R., the record executive. He's a charmer, weilding his acting talent as as a samurai would hold his sword, with self-assuredness and precision in each and every scene. He possesses an unmatched ability to set the scene with his on camera presence....to entice you with his words in every clip...J.R. keeps you watching, waiting, wondering what will happen next...J.R. has an ability to hypnotize you with a unsurpassed display of emotions as he moves from anger to laughter to power hungry record mogul that just compels you to keep your eyes glued to the screen. Hate the game is a must see for anyone seeking to know the secrets of what drama truly is."
1,"does this not scare you, just a little bit?","I don't wish to offend anyone, but I have to say that I find the fundamental concept of this book not only insane but deeply deeply worrying. In a world of domestic violence, rape, child abuse, and God alone knows what else, this book is not only misguided but dangerous."
1,Superior vs Inferior?,"Women and men who believe in this so called ""Jesus prescribed submission"" are missing the point. Jesus' intent as well as God's is to help us see that men and women can live together without domination from either sex. Think of how a dog is submissive to another dog. It will lie on its back and wait for the other dog to rip its belly open while it is piteously whimpering in hopes that its life will be spared. You would be fooling yourself if you believed that true happiness lies in treating another as your superior or inferior. I sometimes wonder if we should be as vigilant of some Christians as the Germans should have been of the Nazis and their ideas of superiority."
1,I Don't Think So,"I tried to read this book with an open mind, but what the author is proposing that grown women act like docile children within their marriages, instead of equal partners. I do not view the subject of submission the way the author does. It appears that she lets men off of the hook from having to meet their wives halfway on different matters. Men aren't being told to to compromise here; instead, their wives are told to do everything their husbands tell them to do, even if they know that it may not be the best solution at all times. Only people who wish the clock turned back to the times when women had no voice--either inside or outside of the home--could appreciate this book. I cannot recommend this one at all."
1,Definately not liberating,"I began reading this book with a very open mind really hoping God's will would be clarified for me on this subject. However, I couldn't even finish more than half of the book as I found it's arguments so unreasonable and disparaging. If you want to know how God values women, I would suggest ""Ten Lies the Church Tells Women : How the Bible Has Been Misused to Keep Women in Spiritual Bondage"" by J. Lee Grady (a man who truly respects God's purposes for all His children, sons as well as daughters)."
5,Good book based on God's word,"My wife read this book and it really helped her with the understanding of the principles of submission found in the Bible.I read it also and I found it very balanced and scripturally based. Satan deceives women into thinking submission will be a pure hell and he tries to encourage the opposite behavior, which is control. I believe this book can help many women and men see how God views submission and it will help liberate their lives! Glory to God!"
1,Docile Women,"The author's take on submission within a marriage is akin to the idea that a woman should always walk two steps behind a man in public. The Bible has clear instructions on how a husband is supposed to act towards his wife, but the author put the onus of obeying onto the wife's shoulders. She's saying a grown woman should practically act as if she's her husband's child (and servant) instead of expressing her voice within the relationship. I do not recommend this for anyone who thinks."
3,"Good Musicianship, Obviously bad studio","I have been into the Detroit Rock scene for over 20 years and was quite anxious to get Mr. Smith's album - I've been watching him rock out with the Diablos and make cameo's on stage for years.Overall, I felt Mike's playing was impeccable - He knows how to go places in his free-form jams that most jam bands play years and never achieve - the accompanying musicians were great as well...I had only one complaint - it was like a bug in my ear - It sounded like the Mastering for this album was more of a band-aid for very rough intitial recordings. I'm used to quite a raw feel from Mike, more organic, but many of the sounds seemed like bad recordings hidden beneath filters.Who knows, I could be wrong. How seedy was that church it was recorded in?"
4,Nice little sheet,"I guess I didn't do the math on this one. It is a very small cookie sheet. I like to fit at least one dozen cookies on a sheet and I cannot on this one. It is nicely made, seems durable, and is easy to clean. I have been using it for biscuits and rolls - things I only make a few of. For small batches, it is nice and useful but it isn't going to get me through a bake sale or Christmas."
3,"Good travelogue, dull mystery","The prose is generally fine, with only the occasional poorly-chosen word causing me to rise from the world on the page to the world around me. The history is interesting, but not my favorite era or place, nor do I read a mystery solely for the exotic locale and culture. As a mystery, for me, there was insufficient character development to care about the investigator or the murderer, or anyone else in the book. The chapters were hit and skip, jumping from one character or place to another, pushing so much history and cultural traditions on the reader that the murder mystery never came into focus for me, but seemed to be more of an aside than the thread that held the book together."
4,No better way to pick up history.,A very relaxing and entertaining way to learn about the transition period after the revolt and the demise of the Janissaries and the very early ideas of change that led to the Attaturk republic.
3,Good but unmemorable,"I understand this book won the Edgard award for best crime novel a couple of years ago, however for the life of me even though I read it last year, I just simply cannot remember much of it. The writing itself was very good of course, and the plot moved along briskly; however aside from the writing nothing really stood out. The book was entertaining enough but the characters, which should have been memorable given the uniqueness in setting and time, really didn't amount to much. In the end a mixed review: easily forgotten once the book was over, but good enough that I went and got the second book in the series. Not a bad way to while away a couple of days, but there are certainly far more memorable historical mysteries out there than this one."
3,Foreknowledge of the Ottoman Empire is helpful,"I was mixed on this novel. I found the writing to be first rate with setting and descriptions that transport you and characterizations that are full of life. On the otherhand, the subject matter made the story, at times, difficult to follow. Having prior knowledge of the Ottomans might have made this more enjoyable - but, nonetheless, enjoy it, I did. Under that paradigm, my ignorance is not the author's fault."
4,Eunuchs + History Lesson + Murder = Good Read,"This offers a glimpse into the declining Ottoman empire through the ironic eyes of a eunuch, who is eloquent & suave. This book is a fun and entertaining read for those who love historical themed novels and mystery. Just think, when was the last time you read a book that even mentioned the word - eunuch. This is not a heavy read at all - Just fun!"
3,"read for setting & atmosphere, look elsewhere for a good story...","This novel really made Istanbul come alive for me--I could see/smell/hear the noises of the bazaar, the sultan's harem, the fire raging in the street...But Yashim himself? I never really felt his pain or frustration. As other people have mentioned, the novel falls down when it comes to the plot of the mystery. But I felt another problem kept me from being on the edge of my seat during this novel. At critical points in the story where the author should most engage me as reader, the writer switched perspective to distance me, rather then bring me deeper into the story. Consequently, I always felt a little distanced from the action. Given that this is the author's first fiction, I will most likely read the second in the series with the hope that there is a plot with tighter construction, less juggling of the point of view, and a more mysterious mystery."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"From all the wonderful reviews this got, both here on amazon and elsewhere, I have to admit I was expecting more from this mystery set during the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. Goodwin is a skillful writer, and he has an obvious love for Turkey and its culture, but the plot seemed hackneyed and the execution was less than riveting.The protagonist Inspector Yashim is a colorful character, but I cared so little for everyone else in the book that I had a hard time finishing it. I hope in between writing the Janissary Tree and his next book, Goodwin brushed up on what makes a good mystery thriller, and can deliver a plot line and set of supporting characters that equal Inspector Yashim."
2,I wanted to like it...,"I wanted to like it - I have spent months in Turkey, a fair bit of time in Istanbul, enjoyed the culture and history, so I thought why not give it a try. I enjoyed the main character - BUT it is too slow. The story (what little of it there is) drags, as almost every chapter (and they are quite short) begins with a long and detailed description of a place or character, like a guide book. And I appreciate that it is billed as a novel, but really, it is a mystery - one that moves quite slowly. Maybe you want to read about the history of the Genoese tower (or some other such thing) every 2nd or 3rd page - but I don't. I've been there, I've seen it. Give me some story, a mystery that moves along more quickly. Do I really have to read all about the ingredients of this dish and that dish? So I began to skip over paragraphs - not my favorite way to read a book. Maybe you won't mind all of the exposition - I prefer a narrative that moves - particularly in a mystery!"
2,Audiobook - terrible narration,"I'm sure Stephen Hoye is a great guy, but I'm miserable listening to his voice right about now. I just returned another audiobook narrated by him, BOOK OF AIR AND SHADOWS. So I took out THE JANISSARY TREE and imagine my utter shock when I started listening and heard the same eccentric over-reading narration that totally doesn't suit the exotic setting of the novel?!?!? OMG I was horrified and have now popped out every disc and will return this as well. Totally unappropriate choice of narrator for this story."
4,Interesting thriller,"It is thriller but also a great stroy telling of times of the Ottoman Empire, the intriquasies of Haram, and the stroy of the lead man in the book."
1,This year's overrated author rides again,"Undeserving of an Edgar, which after all is an award only for the best new mystery, not the best new book. And the mystery in this one is of interest to nobody except perhaps the author (note the 'perhaps'). A eunuch detective -- what? are you kidding? -- is hired to learn why several young members of the military are murdered, one by one, in Istanbul in 1836. The writer loves to weave arcane terms, obscure locations, and bizarre events into a tapestry of the unexplained. And when he realizes something doesn't make sense, he simply leaves it alone, stonewalling it, as if to blame the reader for it. He is a lazy writer and a contemptuous one. No reader who has never been in Istanbul will understand many, many of his allusions. It would have been easy enough to thread the explanations subtly into the descriptions, but he can't be bothered to learn how to do that."
3,Mystery/detective novel.,"I bought it for a story about a eunuch, but that aspect of the main character plays little part in the story. It is a detective/mystery story, and should have been suspense/thriller, except that somehow the excitement never seemed very exciting. I took a full week to read this book, and yet the actual plot is quite good. The author's research appears to have been excellent, at least to this non-expert eye."
4,A good romp through 1836's Istanboul,"It's 1836, and four of the sultan's guards have been kidnapped and murdered, their bodies displayed throughout the city. Who has done this, and why?This is the mystery that Yashim, the sultan's eunuch and detective, must solve.The author takes us through the streets and culture of Istanboul in the early 19th century, a city split by sea and intrigue. We learn about the embassies and the street rats, listen to and see members of the harem in the Seraglio, and explore the hidden mysteries under the streets.Of course in the end all is resolved, masks removed, and Yashim is rewarded with the possibility of yet another mystery to explore."
5,Imaginative mystery from a bygone culture,"Having recently visited Istanbul I found it fascinating to follow the complex plot through the city with an appreciation of the personalities and culture that still retains an imprint of the Ottoman times 150 years ago. The mix of geography, a unique and introspective freelance sleuth, a dash of humor at the expense of the Embassy circuit make it as tasty as some of the Turkish culinary examples of old produced by Yashim."
1,The author missed the boat,"I bought this book, based on the two reviews that had been posted here, to give to a freind that practices Feng Shui. Thank God I read it first. Feng Shui IS funny and would make a great subject for a truly funny book. The book, Wrong Shui, is not that book. In other words, the concept of a funny book about Feng Shui is great. Through lack of finesse this book simply offends."
5,Positive,"The I-TView DV enables one to watch movies captured on the computer screen on one's TV and record to VHS. The DV model works with the Emac, the older ""Gold"" model works with the 2001 little blue imac as well as the Emac. Amazing!"
3,Work well but not durable,"Bought these for my maltipoo a few weeks ago. Have worn them twice, both on 100+ weather days, so sidewalks were SUPER HOT. The boots worked great! Stayed on well and kept his feet cool. After a 20 minute walk on hot sidewalk, the boots were warmish to touch but his feet remained cool. In total he has walked in them for about 40 minutes, on the sidewalk and grass. The only bad thing I can say about them is they really do not last long. Just the 40 minute walking, and a bit of prancing, two of the three boots have tears at the seams, and one is beginning to fray. The package recommended buying goop to put on them to make them more durable, but this costs over $50 a jar. Would be more cost effective to purchase a more durable dog boot instead.Great idea! Poor durability."
3,Not for the Windstar 1999 SEL,"I just received this item and it is not correct for the 1999 Windstar. If you look closely at the connectors, it is wider than the ones on this vehicle, which are more towards the square geometry. Hope all goes well on the return..."

1,wrong fit,ordered because product was supposed to fit my vehicle didnt waited to long to return waste of money on my part
1,Description for application is wrong.,The description states for use for 89-up Ford vehicles. This is incorrect. I have a 2005 Ford Taurus and these did not fit my installation.
2,Solid Non-Flexible Spit -- Sorry Motors!,The spit is a very thick steel bar that is difficult to bend. The forks and clamps to hold the food are solid with thick chrome. The motor is made in Taiwan and my first one came in dead on arrival. Read up on the other Weber Rotisseries reviewed by other customers and you will see the motor is a weak point.
5,Fun !!!,I first read this book years ago.. It has to be my favorite from Piers Anthony so far !! It's out of print.. so get it used while it's available !!
5,This Book Was GREAT!,I thought that this book was the best one of the series. I was even more pleased when I found out that there was a real Xanth companions game! I would recommend this book to anyone.
4,This was a really good book.,This was the first Xanth book I read and it is a very good book. I think Anthony over uses the puns alittle and it was a very sexist book but overall it was fairly well written. I did like the characters and the plot was at fairly fast-paced...
5,Great!!!!!!,"This was a great book, it was my first Xanth book, and if your new to the series, it explains the reasons for the puns, and the weirdness, because there is characters in it from Mundania (here), and they constantly need explinations, and background histories on things."
3,Okay Story,"Demons Don't Dream is probably a fun book, if you are between ages 7-10. It details the adventures of a some young adults who, through a computer game, enter the world of Xanth. Of course there is a computer game which was the inspiration for this book.In the book, (and game), the reader has a ""companion"", someone from an older Xanth novel, lead them through Xanth. Whoever completes the quest first, will win a prize. Like all Xanth novels, everyone is good - even the Demons. There isn't much tension or surprises. Still the writing is fun and, as I said if you are younger, or have young kids, they may enjoy it more.Those who are a little older, 14 or 15 maximum, probably would be happier, though, if they avoided this book. It is not for you. If you are older and want to read an Xanth novel, try one of the first three. They are still written for a younger audience, but they are very enjoyable for older people too."
1,The worst of all Xanth books,"I started reading the Xanth series about 15 years ago, and this is by far the cheesiest of the series. Putting the characters into a computer struck me as a dim attempt at humoring the already two dimensional characters in the Xanth stories. The teenage girl dwells on a boy who is none too bright, and the sexual innuendos in this story just get a bit tiring. The only reason I could possibly think of for reading this book at all is to provide more loose-end tie-ups to the Xanth series as a whole...because most of the later Xanth books refer to things that happen in earlier novels. I am sure this one will come into play in later novels, somehow."
5,A delicious saga,"This is one of Harold Robbins' best and definitely worth reading. It's a delicious novel covering the life of a man from a poor family of farmers, from his teenager years as a coal miner to his death as one of the most powerful union leaders in the USA. The story of this man, Daniel Boone Huggins, is presented as his youngest son goes after his birth land and gets in touch with his father's origins, seeking to understand his father's ways in life. As usual with Robbins' books, real life characters get mixed in the story (Jimmy Hoffa is one of them), helping to improve the interest in the narration. Cutting to the chase: if you loved Mario Puzo's ""The Godfather"", go for this one."
3,has some good tracks but not great overall,"This one did not do much for me the first time I heard it. Quite a few albums don't though so I always give them at least one more try later. It did grow on me, there are some good tracks here. Sounds a little like Faster Pussycat from the Wake Me When Its Over disc I think. Worth picking up if you like the late '80s early '90s hair sound. I give it a 3 out of 5."
2,Casseroles,A lot of the foods listed in the book were not anything that my family would eat. Also the recipes were not as simple as I expected. It should have been called 101 things to do with condensed soup.
4,Great Album!,"Wow! I heard some music of this sort years ago and could never find it again. I had no idea it was from Venezuela. Trying to find good Latin Folk music can be risky, but these are all excellent performances. The recordings are very good quality as well (this is my second Dorian album and they are both excellent). The songs all have unique, driving rythms. My only complaint is that there aren't some vocals or other variety to the songs. They all focus on the Bandola, with some background percussion (but I guess that's what you'd expect from the title). After a few times through the album it can get tiring, but the music itelf is so unique that it will be a great addition to your collection. I look forward to finding more Venezuelan music."
1,These people are idiots,I'm kind of in a bind because these idiots sent me the manual for the GMAT instead of the GRE. Don't buy from this vendor.
5,Works,"This book helped me score 800 and 760 on verbal and quantitative respectively (still waiting for the analytical score). In less than a month, you can brush up on all your skills and check your progress using the practice tests. The CD is useful with its 3 full length computer adaptive tests. The associated internet account gives more tips and help you plan your studies and track your scores. The best thing about the Kaplan program is that you get detailed explanations on EVERY question in the book and the CD - as opposed to Princeton Review which only gives the right answer and focusses on identifying it through shortcuts and elimination."
2,Views of Sicily without Explaination,My main problem with this travel documentary is that you don't know what you are seeing since it's only music and scenes.
2,DVD is a ripoff if you are expecting scenary to dominate content,"This IS NOT a Rick Steve's like video. Music is excellent (Mozart), but the scenery shown is a ripoff.Examples of what was shown, repeated scenes of a horse and buggy, the driver, the horse, the horse's ass, paintings, family at a rocky beach, close up on young girl at beach, then the young boy, ambulance driving in steets of Naples (too many traffic scenes), mummified remains in museum, banyan (?) trees and tree roots, puppet show (come on, a puppet show?), more traffic, .Good stuff included artwork, mosaics, and sculptures in Naples museum, ocean views of Sicily, building and facades, churches, open air shopping and markets, some panoramic shots of countryside,I expected more flyby or driveby scenery/countryside, city shots to give a flavor of the surroundings (rural and city). I consider this a rather amateurish production not worth the price."
4,Tiny but very useful,"This was my first epilator and so i was a little apprehensive but it was better than wat i expeted. It runs on batteries so i can carry it easily, and it get all the hair very well, only the tiny ones r left and it is also not very painful which i was most afraid of....The best thing is it is so affordable..."
3,Good,"This product is really good, the only problem is the battery run low too fast. Otherwise it's great!"
4,Good value!,"Small enough to travel with, easy to use, 2 AA battery last long enough to use several times before reemplacing them. Very satisfied!"
1,Torture,If you like pain this product is for you. I personally can't get used to it. It feels like your being shocked over and over and over. Not worth the time or money shaving is much easier.
5,Greatest Reiki album I've heard so far,"No other Reiki album has blown me away like this one. It doesn't seem to be made for relaxation or meditation, but the music is so beautiful and enjoyable to listen to. You can really connect with it. I believe it's one of the few ""new age"" albums that is truly inspired by something higher."
5,Raku: A Practical Approach,"A complete resource for raku firing. Specific technical information for kiln construction, as well as photos, glaze recipes and much discussion about experimental materials for reduction. If you had only one book to learn about raku tecniques,this should be the one."
3,Not quite what I thought,"I tired researching as much of this album as I could before buying it, but I guess I didn't get enough info. I do like some stuff by Emilie Autumn, and the few songs on here I heard I also enjoyed. However, the album as a whole wasn't really my thing. I've been listening to it more to try and get more into it. I guess my main disappointment was the few songs I heard didn't seem like dance/electronica music, but that's what most of the album is. I enjoy that genre, just not what I wanted this go around."
5,Out of this world,You want to hear something different? Emilie Autumn is a star by herself. She represents a new way to get in touch with your inner-self.
5,Great evolution of EA's sound,"This is a big jump up from her previous CD ""Enchant"" - that wasn't a bad album at all, but one can sense that Emilie Autumn was still searching for her own voice as she was experimenting with different sounds. Her sound has come into its own on ""Opheliac"", in which her classical training and compositional skills really shine through her dramatic and theatrical flair. Stylistically this CD is very consistent - EA's influences still show (imagine Kate Bush jamming with Annie Lennox, Ute Lemper, Nigel Kennedy and Kraftwerk at a Shakespearean poetry recital), but she has melded the sounds of these various artists into something of her own. Standout tracks include the title track Opheliac, Swallow, Liar, Misery Loves Company and Gothic Lolita."
4,Garmin Street Pilot 7200 Mounting Bracket,"The bracket purchased through Amazon was identical to the original supplied with the Street Pilot on purchase. A second one is needed if you intend to move the GPS unit from car to car, and it seems shortsighted by Garmin to not offer this accessory directly on their web site. Do they really think people will buy a second GPS unit simply because no second mounting bracket is available from them?The unit mounts easily, with metal tabs that can be bent to fit various dashboard configurations. Once mounted, it it a simple matter to slide the base of the Street Pilot unit into and out of the mount, where it locks securely. This is a VERY simple accessory but it serves its purpose."
5,Excellent,"'Cantata Criolla' by Antonio Estevez (a venezuelan composer) resumes the authentic sounds of venezuelan plains. The combination of the choir as a narrator, the soloists as 'Florentino' (a cowboy) and 'el diablo' (the devil) as the principal actors and the orchestra creating the environment is wonderful handled. It's a supreme music work and, I think, the most important work of venezuelan 20th century music. It's a ""must-be-listened""..."
1,poor service and rising rates,"I have been an ATT/Cingular customer for 4 years, and I have been relatively happy with them until a couple months ago, when ATT started raising rates on text messages multiple times over the course of just a couple months. One of the main reasons I went with ATT instead of Verizon, which has much better service and wider coverage, was that ATT didn't charge for incoming text messages and had a relatively cheap text message rate. Well, when I looked at my bill a couple months ago, lo and behold, they had started charging for incoming text messages. The next month, rates went up for text messages, the month after that, rates changed again. When I called to talk to customer service, I was basically given the brush off and the message that they could do what they like with their text message rates. When my contract is up, I will be switching to Verizon or to T-mobile."
1,Music?,"This is without a doubt the worst CD I have ever heard.And I'm a long time Jimmy Reed fan.The band was so loaded that they couldn't play.Can't even here Johnny Winter, just the rythum section stepping all over each other.Unbelievable. Why was this ever recorded?"
5,Accessible,"Just discovered and Mr. Adams is a treat. If you are a fan of classical music, give this guy a try."
5,GREAT PENGUIN SHOWER CURTAIN,"Heavy vinyl curtain. Just what I needed as it matches a whole array of items I already have including towels, rug, toilet seat, and material to make curtains. Good quality and fast shipping.."
4,The jury's still out,"I used this for a hurt shoulder, and within a week I noticed drastic improvement. The injury had been slow to heal, but being a sceptic, I wonder if it was going to heal anyway. Tried it on some sore itra-scapular muscles last night...only slightly better today. Still, I did do some research before purchasing and there is something to the ifra-red promoting healing. I don't regret the purchase. Time will tell as I use it more (I'm injury prone)."
2,Poor quanlity blocking device function,"I have purchased and used LightReliefLight Relief Infrared Pain Relief Device under three months, it is helpful, but stopped working since last weekend. It is very poorly made. The device supposed to relieve physical pain. But such short life span product brought much more mental pain to deal with vender-LightRelief LLC. I have contacted them, the answer is the replacement shipping fee will come from customer pocket(both ways). It is their policy. The policy they made certainly is harmful for their business and indicated their really don't care about the product reputation. It'll discurage not only current customers but also bring bad reputation for the company and their product. It is not a wise policy for heir bunisess future."
4,Light Relief Light Therapy,"My wife has rhumatoid arthritis, and finds that the Light Relief Light Therapy really does give her relief from the pain in her wrists, face, hips, back and other areas where she encounters arthritis pain. She is more than pleased with this unit. One caution would be to be careful when using the unit with the heat mode. It can cause a burn to the skin, which was one of the warnings in the user guide.Sataisfied User."
3,pain relief,"Got it several years ago, for severe back and muscle pain. After a while my pain got too severe for it to work. I had back surgery, and was doing well until 2 months ago. The muscle pain is back with a vengance. I can't get the Light Relief unit to turn on. I know the distributors are worthless when you need help. Don't know how to rate it."
1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!,I have very bad back joint pain and thought this would be great. Used it for 3 weeks every day for 20-30 minutes. The heat was good but the pain was still there. Then went to return it and I did not see the 30% RESTOCKING FEE! Plus the shipping and handling to and from the seller. So there really is a not a 30 day money back guarantee. READ THE RETURN POLICY!!!
1,Costumer Service,"This company tends to send you more than you ordered and/or simply charge you more for nothing. Bottom line, you almost certainly will need to contact costumer service. Their costumer service department will pretend they can't hear you, hang up on you, say that they're going to help you and leave you hanging, etc. The product is just not worth so much trouble."
5,Irene Bridges,I have nerve pain in toes and arthritis in hand when these act up Im stopped. This machine has been wonderful. stops the pain the first time every time. one 15 min application and Im pain free.
1,It's a SCAM!!!,"I was hopeful that this would work for shoulder pain relief, but I will never know. It worked one time, then, poof!! Wouldn't even turn on. The reset button would reset... one flash of green light then nothing. A piece of junk. The worst part is they not only DO NOT refund shipping, but you get to pay to return it. So. you are out $40 just for shipping charges. Besides when you order from the TV ad, they try to sell you pills that they will charge every month. DO NOT EVEN TRY THIS PRODUCT. THEIR MARKETING TECHNIQUES ARE UNCONCIONABLE AND THEIR PRODUCT IS CHEAP TRASH!! It should be taken off the market and not allowed to be sold anywhere, ever!!"
1,Light Review Device...Abject Failure,"I had high hopes that the Light Device would help to alleviate tendon pain as advertised. As it turned out,it had no beneficial effect at all."
5,Light Relief Infrared Pain Relief Device,"The real deal for light therapy technology, it works, for any body pains simply put the light device on the area and pain goes away naturally. Remarkable device, highly recommended."
5,I love this,"I was replacing one that quit working after a few years of constant use. I was ver happy to receive this, in a few days of ordering it. Not only did I revved the unit , it also came with back pad. Adapter, and a carrying bag."
2,Very sorry I bought this,An ordinary heating pad gave me way more back relief than this appliance. I wouldn't recommend that anyone buy this.
1,light relief,The device did not work to relieve my wife's pain like we had hoped it would. I also used it for neck and shoulder pain but did not notice any difference. the heat felt good that's all.
1,Terrible,"This product did not perform as promised. I do not recommend it, as it is certainly not worth the money."
1,a joke of a product,I wish we had read the reviews on this Light Relief product before we bought it. I bought it for my spouse but what a mistake this decision was. The only relief this item achieves is the withdrawal from the bank account. Its light healing properties are pure baloney.
1,was mohelp for paim,"mo good did me mothimg for paim, used it mamy days, mo results. would recomemd it to mo ome. sorry product"
2,Does not work as advertised,"The machine has lights flashing and slight heat, but provides no pain relief; not even temporarily. The description for this product is very misleading. The 30 day return policy is not long enough to try out this product at all."
3,It's okay..that's all.,I have not found it to be as effective as I expected. The one strap was broken on the plastic part to snap together.
4,very good,"this product is excellent, since it release my back pain with heat and lightI already bought this products twice, last one years ago but the pad withpoor connect after used for one year, so I bought a new one"
2,disappointed,"I have sciatica, lumar disk herniation, and pain, so I thought let's try this out! It did NOT work, te little bit of heat from the machine may help some, but light pain relief is not to the level I hoped it would be. Light, sound, smells are necessary for a relaxed, sound body & mind, but this device did NOT work for me."
3,Possibly a good healer. Feel it is a bit over priced.,It is difficult to tell what the level of healing is or the results butI do like that it is small and the heat function feels wonderful.Feel itis a over priced.
5,Muscle / Joint Relief,"Using the high frequency function of the light therapy instrument on my shoulder, I was able to fully lift my extended arm above my head in about thirty minutes after its application. I had spent several weeks of trying other relief methods for my shoulder joint with very limited success. I added heat when treating muscles for soreness and tightness and got relief within about fifteen minutes. The instrument is easy to use. I use it while working on my computer."
1,Not very happy wih this contraption,"Perhaps my expectations were much higher than what I got. To me this is nothing but an expensive, glorified light show, it works ok as a hand warmer, but it's very hard to use on other areas such as the neck, the back or even the knees, because of is shape. Although it does work ok on big muscle areas, as long as you can hold it with your hands... and it's not warm enough for some areas of the body either. I'm disappointed that I bought into the hype."
1,restocking fee to high,That heat light didn't work for me at all. I'd be better off buying a large heating pad & I'd be money ahead. I was charged a 10% restocking fee. That's ridicules. What kind of restocking do they have to do they take it out of the box & resell it to another sucker.
1,A BAD PRODUCT FROM A BAD COMPANY,Light Relief Light TherapyMy wife and I both tried this product and got no relief at all. She ended up with burns on her back and I had to take even more pain pills than without it. I have since read reports from medical journals that say this could even make your arthritis worse. This is a terrible product.
1,Lightrelief Not Found,Light Relief Light TherapyLight Relief Infrared Pain Relief DeviceExtra Large Pad for Light Relief TherapyHave extensive use I found NO benefit from this device. I did give it a try. Another product sold using a movie star testamonial.
1,NOT so much,"Bought one for my mom, one for my mother-in-law.The thing did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for pain or stiffness or anything. Plus, although I paid for all in a onetime payment (not installments) the next month they charged my account again! When the charge was posted the phone number posted with it was not the phone number for Light Relief. When I protested with my bank they said I had to call Light Relief first to protest the charge...difficult to do since they inconveniently provided a wrong number. Coincidence? I doubt.If I had spent $80.00 each for 2 hot water bottles I'd have made a better purchase as at least THAT would have worked. The ONLY thing that got relieved in this purchase was my debit card. Suggest that instead of buying a Light Relief, one might purchase some Biofreeze and a hot water bottle, and spend the difference on a massage."
4,This appliance works for my aches and pains,"I amy happy with the product. There was a bit of a problem with shipping, but they called me and they made good on it. I think that I would not hesitate to buy from them again."
1,Low-heat microwave?,"I thought about trying out this product after seeing the TV ad, but after thawing the frozen beef one afternoon to prepare for dinner, the thought of slowly cooking my own body came to me. Before buying this product, google ""lightreief and ""scam"" will come up, very interesting. (I had to rate it to get by the commenting process, so the one star came from reading about it in [...]). I would definitely avoid it."
4,Light Relief,"This seems to work, but in a very subtle sense. It does take some time to build up to any consistent level, but it really is more chronic, low level pain that seems to be affected. My daughter has spina bifida; her pain is very acute. There is some relief, but I would not recommend this for any conditions of the like."
1,Heat pad works just as well and alot cheaper/more comfortable,"I bought this item yrs ago when it first came out for like $20. I lost the cord in a move and was never able to get connected to someone who could help me replace it. Now they are doing tv promo's with a tel # I called and she kept repeatedly asking for my name/address/tel # etc. I told her I did not want to provide personal info until I could find out about a replacement. Finally she informed me that it was not possible. So I guess I just toss the item. Now with people paying 3x as much, dont damage the cord or your out of the money you spent. Also, pls note all this thing did was provide heat the colors dont do squat, I'm now sure since clearly this is a flakey company. A heating pad would be MUCH more comfortable, easier to use and alot cheaper."
2,Did not work,This was purchased to help my husband's back pain. He used it as directed but it didn't work! Save your money.
4,interesting,I have gotten relief from pain in my back and hands. Was sorry to find out that accessories had to purchased separately. the addition of the soft pad will help I am sure!
5,So pleased we bought another one.,"Shortly after purchasing this, we made a trip to visit our best friends, and took this along for some pain issues we were having. After sharing it with our friends, we gifted our first unit to them, and bought another unit. We just visited them again, and the husband uses this at least once a day, and the wife 2-3 times a week. We love our unit also."
1,My 2 cents worth!,"Upon receiving this unit, I noticed it was very lightweight. I plugged it in and it got warm, but I didn't notice anything advantageous with the blinking lights except for show. My wife, who's a nurse felt the same way. For $80+ I felt this unit was not worth it. I returned it and Amazon was fast and efficient in refunding my money. Thank you Amazon!"
1,Hate is a strong word,I just found it a bit worthless. It is nothing more than a very expensive heating pad. The infomercial is all bunk like most of them are. I did find some positive write ups for it online but they were probably written by someone trying to sell it. I'm happy I'm able to return it.
1,Did not work....,"Sadly, I was so looking forward to getting this, but it simply did not work at all from the moment it arrived. I really hate to say this, but I have ordered a number of these kind of health devices - like the chi machine - for example. They all have this kind of ubiquitous plastic housing when they arrive. They all have the same kind of crappy, really cheap looking red lights etc....and every single item I have ever ordered like this, made in China, has been absolute junk that never worked. I will never buy another device like this again"
3,Works okay,We bought this on the advice of a friend. She loves hers. It works okay. Turns off after aprox. 15 - 20 minutes. Makes a nice light show. The larger pad works better.
1,lasted a month,"Loved it while it worked, but after a month of an hour per day usage the level of infrared heat went to about zero. Hit the reset button and no improvement. In the Instruction Manual it suggest you replace it every two years, which seems to indicate it has some longevity issues. I'll call the company on Monday and see if they'll replace it. If it would last for the two years I wouldn't mind that timeframe of usage as I really did experience some relief."
4,Works great.,"I ordered this product for my mom, who suffers from a frozen shoulder. After about a week of using it, her pain was almost completely gone. Unfortunately, after two weeks it quit working. So I returned it and ordered another one. So far, so good. It really does work for her. But if this one quits working also, I may give up on it.Amazon was prompt with my refund, which I appreciated very much."
4,Light Relief,This is a great product. I use it to recover from soreness after my workouts. My ankle hurts profusely after I run but after thirty minutes under the Light Relief the pain is gone. I wish I had invested in a product like this years ago. The only downfall is there's no way to control the heat element. It becomes unbearable after about ten minutes. Other than that it's great. I may have to order the larger pad to go along with it.
2,Didn't help me.,The warmth was nice but I got no relief from it. I used it every day on several spots of thigh pain for 30 days. They refunded my money no problem.
4,light relief,"At first I wasn't sure I liked this product but I have a bad back (herniated disks with psiatica) and I could barely walk. I used the light relief and I was able to make it through the day. It is not a one time use product. You need to continue to use it. I feel any relief is better than NO relief, and this product does help me."
3,electrical adaptner is terrible,"I have bought about 3 of these units in the past 4 years. It works perfectly, but I have trouble with the light connection cord it breaks inside and I have to move it constantly to make it work, the Electrical adapter does the same. It is cheaply made and the wiring splits inside easily. I have called and called and never get a return call from the company. Because it works so well. I continue to order them. I have used the batteries but it cost too much to keep replacing them.. I am really tired of the wires breaking and don't think that I will order another one this time.."
2,dissappointed,The instructions are hard to decipher & massive for no reason. The outer perimeter lights don't work & I have yet been able to reach anyone to find out if the device is broken or I'm doing something wrong.
2,Light Relief unit defective after less than 2 weeks use,"The unit has a built in timer, that shuts it off after 15 minutes to prevent overheating. However, after less than 2 weeks of use, the timer was not shutting off, and it got too hot to touch.The company is sending me a replacement unit, and hopefully that will have a more robust timer to keep the treatment time limited to 15 minutes as designed."
1,NOT AS SHOWN IN PICTURE,"I was looking forward to this item, when it arrived however there was no pad included as the picture shows. If the pad was to be sold separately the seller should not have it as part of the picture.Besides this the machine does not work properly, it does not hold charge and only a couple of the LED lights come on. Now I'm stuck with something that does not work."
5,Light Relief does give relief!,"Light Relief was recommended to me by my alternative physician and I certainly have not been disappointed. The heat should be applied on a regular basis, daily if possible, to get the best results. It's safe to use at night because it will turn off automatically after 15 minutes."
1,Not for me,Tried it diligently for three weeks. No pain relief.Amazon is fantastic and gave me a refund in two of three days.I wouldn'st reccomend this to a dog let alone anyone else. My wife didn't get any relief from her back pain either.
5,Pain relief,This product is awesome. I was kinda leary at first to buy it but I suffer from severe pain in many parts of my body and I figured if it helped even 1 it would be worth it. It has I have an old injury from a broken clavical that healed improperly and now have bone spurs from it. This is amazingly helpful in calming the nerve endings with the heat and therefore easing the pain. Love it would definitely reccomend it to others.
1,Unhappy,This device did not work at all. I had read some bad reviews but tried anyway. I have sent it back for credit. Guess I'll have to see how that goes...
1,Bad quality product!,"I found the product Light RElief on TV and bought it via the phone. I was excited that I finally found something, which could help me to release the pain However, after I used it few times within two weeks, the product was broken. Meanwhile, I also found I was charged for their automatic monthly delivery of the Joint Support supplement, for which I never authorized them to do so. With my bank's help, it took me three month to stop them to deliver the unwanted supplements. It was a bad experience and wasted a lot of my time."
4,It actually works!,This is actually my second unit. My inlaws liked how well it worked that I gave it to them and had to get another one.
1,Excessive Heating From Device,"I purchased the device on November 11, 2012. The device produced excessive heat at the lowest setting and would have burnt my hand had I not acted quickly. Some smoke was detected from under the rubber pad accompanied by a strong burnt wire type smell which permeated the entire room. I am returning the unit on November 19, 2012. I hope this is a one time problem with the unit but I would not take another chance after my experience. Thank goodness for Amazon and its return policies."
1,Read raving reviews about light therapy,"But sorry.I'm not able to do an honest review on this product. My pain was not supposed to be helped by this product in the manner I was hoping for. The problem was really deep-seated. I was all ""out of line"". For real.Read my review about Pete Egoscue's ""Pain Free"".Pain Free: A Revolutionary Method for Stopping Chronic Pain"
1,These Really Work,"Pardon my one star. The Light Relief Unit really works, I've used one similar to this in the yoga studio, and also, my neighbor has one. But I received my unit yesterday. (Ordered through Amazon cause I don't have a credit card to get one from the actual website. My card was hacked locally, a couple of weeks ago, still waiting for my new one...)Amazon allows you to use the bank account, which is awesome. The Light Relief website does not allow any other payments but credit cards.The unit I received is damaged. I have to send it back, cause the connector to the pad is completely bent and doesn't turn the lights on the the pad. It makes no connection whatsoever. That makes me wonder if these are returned, damaged units...So now, I have to go through this, wait for the refund, wait for my bank card to arrive, and finally order one from the website, which is a PITA, cause of all the other offers that go along with it. Amazon, I would check into this seller."
4,Seems to work...,I have a bad back and the light relief seems to help me.I have only used it a couple of times on my bAck and my knee.I did experience relief.Thanks.
1,Light Relief Therapy machine,"I ordered a Light Therapy machine on amazon .com & I paid for it on October 8, 2012 by Mastercard.It worked the first two times I used it and never again. I have tried using the reset button. I usean electric outlet & have tried different outlets to no avail.The start & warm lights go on, but the little lights that are placed on your skin, they do not andthe machine does not warm up at all.Sincerely,priscillatrujillo"
5,Light Relief 90LR15LR01,"I have other similar products from Light Relief, and given them to relatives who needed pain relief....The one I just purchased is very helpful to my arthritic knee. I recommend it for aches and pain."
1,QUITE DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this product with great expectations. I tried using it on different areas of my anatomy where I had experienced pain. Unfortunately, I had no relief. Maybe i was expecting too much. After 30 days I was ready to return it but it was my fault that I didn't read that it it was not returmable after 30 days. I have no use for it as it sits in a drawer in my file cabinet."
5,Warm relief,The light relief has helped me get over shoulder pain. It's easy to use. I've also used it on my lungs to help me get over a bronchial condition with a cold I had.
2,bad luck mabe!,"easy to work used it a day and a half, then it refused to work no matter what i did.I'm guessing just bad luck, but it seemed to work, but didn't have it long enough to be sure."
5,Arthritis relief,"Our veterinarian told me how happy he was with his Light Relief for knee pain, so I purchased it for my arthritic foot and hip. The joint on the top of my foot gets very sore and stiff, due to calcium deposits in the joint. Light Relief works wonderfully to give me relief. I started using Light Relief morning and night about a month ago, and I have not had any soreness to speak of since then. I use it periodically on my hip, and it also lessens that pain. I did purchase the larger Light Relief pad to cover my hip, as the area of lights on the pad that comes with the machine is only about 3 1/2"" x 6""."
1,did nothing for the pain,the lites are nice but i had to use my old infrared heating pad to get red of the pain .....ron
1,FAIR AT BEST,"I DO ENJOY HER MUSIC, BUT WHO EVER FILMED IT NEEDS TO GET ANOTHER JOB, THE CAMERA WAS EVERYWERE, AND NOT ALLWAYS ON PINK, I DONT KNOW IF THEY WERE TRYING TO BE ARTSY BUT IT WAS UNWATCHABLE,HEY DO WANT TO BUY ONE CHEEP?"
5,Great Stories,I really enjoyed how these stories were done. How the stories were told. This really gives some insight to that type of lifestyle. Can't wait for the next season.
5,love it,"love the video, my friends all love the dvd. a friend of mine took the dvd and never return it. he has showed it to more of his friends who love it."
4,Good Look in to the DL Life,I liked this DVD and it tells three different looks at the DL life. It makes you look at different points of views without focusing on one stereotype.
4,real life or reel life,"If you want a look at the much hyped ""down-low"" lifestyle of black and latino men this is the dvd for you. Some of the stories were predictable but still enjoyable. I wish that there were more than four episodes, but, oh, well. My personal favorite was the ""Mark"" episode. Although, the ""Boo"" one gave a new take on gangsta loviing."
4,Eye Opener,"I couldn't wait to view this video and when it arrived I was equally pleased. The first segment didn't do it for me but the following three marked its justice. I found the segment on Raymond to be the most compelling to watch. It seemed more realistic then the others.Boo was another good one to watch. Boo kept me on edge of frustration and laughter. The ending of Boo's segment was chilling with a reminder to always practice safe sex. I hope there is a continuation to DL Chronicles, if so I will certainly purchase it."
5,DL Chronicles,This DVD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It was very entertaining to watch as well.
4,Needs More Episodes Produced,"The DL Chronicles: The Complete First Season is lacking in very few aspects. However if there is a sore spot, it is the number of episodes - too few for this viewer. Hopefully here! cable channel will allocate more funding to generate a full season - 22 episodes. The variety of actors and their respective talent happens to be the cornerstone of the high quality production. The fact the directors/producers keep the story lines moving forward is another reason to celebrate The DL Chronicles. Here's hoping the second season will be just as sucessful and thought provoking."
1,2 down & none for me,"I purchased this unit and within 2 hours it quit working - couldn't get to menus, couldn't select station, no output, and remote never worked. I returned it and got a replacement. The replacement worked for about 4 hours and quit broadcasting - all the menus worked but nothing was broadcast regardless of what frequency I switched it too. In addition, the remote never worked. In both cases, I checked the battery and they were good. Based on my experience, I'd look for another unit with a proven track record."
3,Go Broncos!,"Shows great vintage bronco video, classic broncos and a good history of the NFL. A must have for any Orange and Blue!"
4,Craig Morton - The First Great Number 7,"Great films of the early Bronco years and the beginning of Broncomania. I wish more focus was given to the first real ""NFL Quarterback"" - Craig Morton, that Denver had. A must for all fans of Denver football."
3,Nice DVD,"I love the Broncos and have seen the lows ( 80's Super Bowls ) and the highs ( 90' s Super Bowls ) so I was excited about this release. Overall, it is good. The first DVD is a lot of good info and history while disc two is the Drive game in Cleveland. Yeah, a great game for sure and I love it, but I would have loved to have seen their first Super Bowl win as a complete game. I love the Broncos so I like this DVD, but it leaves one desiring a lot more knowing their rich history."
1,Doesn't mount on standard BBQs,"This product is nice but will not mount on standard BBQs that use a thread back. I have no way of mounting it. Home Depot hardware had nothing that I could utilize. I should have bought the standard thermometer replacement at Home Depot for under $8.00. I have inquired about returning this product, but have received no reply. I guess I have a really nice worthless thermometer."
2,Bill James was never this dull!,"I picked up this book with high hopes. The promise of a Bill James-like book kept me alive throughout the winter. Alas, the BBBA failed to deliver. Although it has some interesting features (I particularly liked the QMAX), much of the other statistical discussions were dull. Lots of pretty charts and graphs to look at, but dull, dull, dull.The authors tried to be witty and irreverant like James was, but most of the time came across as just being mean.And, to top it all off, there are many typographical and grammatical errors scattered throughout the book. My favorite was the pitcher with the ""soar"" arm.Spend your money somewhere else."
4,Nifty graphics,Interesting read. Lots of writers give you a lot of different perspectives. Some of the statistics are interesting. The graphic design is a nice counterpoint to the content. The layout breaks up the numbers well.
5,"Slightly more academic than I'd expected, but what a great book.","Truly a landmark reference book. Doesn't claim to, nor desire to teach you forensics, but if this is an area that interests you, it's only a matter of time before you need this book.It's too easy to use current point-and-click forensic tools without understanding what's going on under the hood. This book shows in excruciating detail all the file systems, and how to analyze them with TSK. There's no substitute for down and dirty examinations with a powerful tool like this - and everything you learn can carry over to the ""point-and-click"" tools so commonly used.Just a superb learning tool. Priceless."
5,Essential tool!!!,This book is a MUST for every forensic officer who works with computers. It's amazing the quantity and the quality of the informations.
4,Very Pleased,"I had 30+ years of accumulated material that went through this machine. I spaced the shredding over a period of 3-4 days. I did jam it a few times, through my own negligence. Once it took me some time to unjam, but I was getting impatient and put too much paper in at once. Let the machine rest for periods of time.You really need the special formula oil as well as bags to line the basket. Regular trash bags are cheaper and work fine. Oil formulated for shredders can be found at office supply stores.Shreds credit cards OK, but did not like CD's..."
2,Nice Features But Auto Shred Stopped Working,"We bought ours at OfficeMax - 3 or 4 months later the auto-start sensor stopped working. It works fine if you switch it to on (instead of auto)but the auto-start was much more convenient. I like having a non-shred opening in the back for misc items and the credit card shredder works well. This may be the case with all shredders, but I was amazed at how much paper dust is generated by this thing. We finally resorted to using a kitchen trashcan liner since it was such a mess to unload. Tiny pieces of paper tend to stay caught up in the teeth, but this doesn't seem to impact the unit's ability to shred paper."
5,This is a great shredder!,"I bought the shredder for my home use. The shredder top is very heavy duty, with nice, strong blades, and it has a handle for easy lifting. I have been using it for a couple of months now, and love it. I highly recommend it."
1,Frustratingly weak shredder,Too weak - bogs down with 6 sheets - jambs if I try and shred more. Found a Staples shredder twice as powerful for less.
5,Shredding,I owned a Fellowes shredder previously and selected the PS-65C based on the performance of the older product. I am pleased with the new PS-65C.
5,Gourd Information,This book is the best I have found for giving an overview of the way to grow and decorate gourds. Many pictures augment the text and are helpful to understand the processes that are mentioned in the text. The examples pictured gave one a great jumping off place to start creating; and the projects do the same by showing various techniques.
3,Gourd Craft,This book was ordered to give me ideas about gourd carving and crafting. It is full of highly detailed photos of excellent artist. It provides lots of good ideas and will help me in my own designs.
5,Gourd crafts book,"The book was in excellent condition and arrived promptly. I was very pleased with the service, price and book."
5,The inspirational book for anyone working with gourds,"This book is illustrated with great pictures, easy-to-follow instructions, and great ideas all in a slim volume whose size belies the enormous amount of information. A delight and a must have for anyone contemplating being a gourd artist or those who just love gourds"
4,She fully has the ability as a solo artist.,"Hiro finished activity of SPEED in March, 2000,and by to release ""Bright Daylight"", she achieved the shift change to solo activity.This music is a turning point when hiro which worked as a member of the group ""SPEED"" until now began to work as a solo artist.When we begin something, we feel fear and uneasy.We also expect that we can meet with new something.The feeling along which two feelings mix hiro, finally turns to a front, and he is going to begin to walk by singing ""Bright Daylight"" of changing vigorously is expressed. So, this music is bright and forcible.I think that this music is not No. 1 in hiro's songs.However, we can hear a beautiful falsetto by hiro in this song."
5,Attention!!,"Attention: Fans of underground hip-hop and experimental music, you are sleeping on this!! I hate reviewing stuff, so I'll be brief, but someone had to post a review of this one. Josh Abrams has been a bass player in the Chicago underground scene for quite some time, but this is his first disc as a solo artist. Having worked with Prefuse 73 and members of Tortoise in the past, these influences definitely come through, but Abrams clearly carves out his own niche in the post-modern beatworld, and scores again and again. Three solid guest vocal appearances and several tight instrumentals later, you end up with one of the best albums of the year, without a doubt."
1,It's hard to review a product that you never got.,This ITEM never came. I was dissatisfied with this. I had to give it one star anyway. I didn't want to though.
3,"Well written, insightful, but disturbing.","The late Scott OHara has a talent for his craft - not that of porn god - but that of serious writer. His book was insightful, succinct, and well written. OHara pulls no punches in describing the poignant and revealing parts of his past. I did find his opinions on voluntary seroconversion to be quite disturbing, however. He takes the position that people who choose to seroconvert willingly are freeing themselves from the everyday burdens of mundane life and ""taking the plunge"" into a more exciting, devil may care existance. This opinion is one that I find quite hard to swallow."
2,Mostly disappointing,"I think the other reviewers must be groupies or simply amazed that a porn star can write in a half-way literate manner. The early history is interesting, but the rest is repetitive and boring. The personal philosophy seems self-serving and, frankly, superficial. The videography will be helpful to die hard fans and porn collectors. The poetry is, at best, sophomoric."
1,Grates are different sizes,"Very disappointed! The second grate is much smaller, not 12 x 0.5 x 17 inches as described but only 8.5 inches wide. I thought it might be an error but I've tried twice and both time the second smaller grate was sent. I need 2 grates at the stated 12 x 0.5 x 17 inches size.Amazon return policy is very easy and efficient, though....."
5,Weber enthusiasts and vegetable lovers...a must!,"These little items (4 included in the product, which hold 2 veggies each!) will help your potato and corn on the cob BBQ woes. These gems hold the vegetables at an angle while grilling, allowing heat to circulate around the food.If you enjoy vegetables with your BBQ, but hate the scorching and square inches they devour on the grill...these are a hit!I cooked a couple Idaho's the other night, in 40 minutes they were the best potatos I have ever prepared.Quality? They are Weber...enough said."
4,Good but not prefect,"It does what it says, I had some problems with the potatoes that were on the smaller size, they would rip off the stand when they were cooking. Bigger ones worked good and cooked great, and nothing beats grills corn. If you are cooking a lot of food they do take up some room while cooking but for a family of 4, I can get everything on the grill."
5,Can't wait to read it.,"My wife and I heard Clarence speak at a Family Life marriage conference this past weekend in San Antonio, TX. He was one of two featured speakers. He was tremendous. We even had a brief opportunity to speak with him privately in the hotel elevator. He was a joy. I am ordering the book now and can hardly wait to read it."
4,more photos,"this book was very interesting in that one could explore the eIvertyday goings on of a time that we're so far removed from.I would like to have seen many more photos. You can identify much more with the characters in this way. from a historical point of view it was quite enlightening to see how black americans took a hand in their own destiny what with all the odds staked against them. we can see the format that is used even to this day. another interesting point is that there is noting new under the sun. It seems some of the everyday occurencess still prevail today under different circumstances. Though at times the letters were a little boring and written without prpoer punctuation, it helped to bring out the true personality of the writer. All in all for me it was a trip back into time."
4,A good collection of stories,"As one who is both from a blue collar background and currently in academia, I found this an interesting collection of stories. As some others have said, after a while the stories did get a bit redundant, but that doesn't detract from the quality of the book. It is a good read."
2,He said-she said,"Interesting book if interested in author. His claim to have Hepburn at his beck and call until he found someone ""better"" sounds a bit self serving in light of the fact Hepburn never mentioned the supposed affair to any of her friends according to Barry Paris' book on Audrey. Could it be that Ben is a legend in his own mind?"
2,Another cheap paper envelope sleeve for CD/DVDs.,"Every other CD/DVD sleeve/envelope on Amazon has bad reviews for cheap quality sleeves, but these had no reviews, so I thought I'd be the test case. I'm sorry to report these are not what I had hoped for. They appear to be made from standard photocopier paper with a window and flap. On the good side the window does seem to be glued to the paper well and does not come off like some others I've seen. On the bad side the flap is bearly scored and when you try to fold it over, it's is easy to get it folded in the wrong place.I'm just looking for a sleeve that is the same quality as what OEMs use for their CDs and DVDs. One of the problems with all these cheapo sleeves is that because they are so flimsy they make it more difficult to insert the CD/DVD. When you are stuffing 200+ of these, it really adds up to a lot of extra time.I got them, I'll use them, but I don't buy another sleeve on amazon."
3,Average Cover,"Item is as advertised, just a dust cover and no more.Great response from seller, package arrived in very good condition. Good Job!"
5,a really kind seller and a wonderful book,The book was in an excellent condition and it was packed up professionally and just like a present!
5,It's back!,I've been searching for this game for years and now it has been reworked and reprinted by Avalon Hill. Like most multiplayer games it is funner with four players. The object of the game is to get five colonies outside of your own system. Every player has one of twenty special alien powers that influence the game. These powers are definitely not balanced but they do make for interesting combinations. Once you learn the rules you can play a game in 30-60 minutes.Hopefully Avalon hill will release expansions in the future that add more alien powers and players.
2,Bad Version of a Great Game,"This version is by far the worst version of the game. Still, it's CE, so it's fun if you don't have access to the other versions and are willing to pay the overblown price. This version is pretty, which is its only good point. The rules were changed poorly, and this version is set up to prevent any possibility of expansion...a major flaw in Cosmic Encounters. Even the tokens (ships) though pretty, are bulky and oversized. The artwork was a substantial improvement over the Mayfair version, but for me, a long term Cosmic Encounter fan, its multitude of careless flaws made the game less enjoyable. I do not recommend this version. I imagine only a collector would want this one, or someone who's never played CE before and isn't interested in expansion. Me...I threw mine in the trash and dusted off my old Mayfair version. The newCosmic Encounterfrom Fantasy Flight is distantly superior in every imaginable way and much less expensive, as is every other version."
5,WOW,"This cd is amazing! Im a child who is almost always listening to alternative music or the pop princesses Britney or christina! I have a new found respect for Celtic music! It is graceful yet it makes you want to jump to your feet and dance. This cd was great the fiddle ceases to amaze me! I don't know what it is that makes me like the cd, but it extremly well done! I listened to many more celtic cd that I bought after this one, but this one is my favorite it's always in my cd player!! So let me tell you this an awsome cd and if it's you're style get it!"
5,D'Aulaires' Book of Trolls,"The D'Aulaire's Book of Trolls is a delight for any reader who enjoys tales with a bit of gruesome detail. The heavy pages are so satisfying, making this feel much more substantial than just a children's storybook- it has the feel of a work of art. The classic black/white D'Aulaire art was originally done with lithographic stones and the color pages were done with acetate overlays- one for each color. The final feel is almost as if the images were hand done in your personal copy of the book.The tales themselves are filled with fun but not for the faint of heart- here is a favorite passage in our house 'The more heads a troll had, the more trouble he had at mealtimes, for all his greedy mouths shouted, ""I am hungry. Feed me first. It's my turn!"" Since even a many headed troll had only two hands, he would be a very tired troll before the meal was over...'"
5,8 year old liked,"Bought this as a diversion from electronic games, etc. for grandson. He was not enthused at first but after we read stories together he liked it a lot and was willing to spend the time reading."
1,Wrong size,"These were advertised as Weber 9930 grates. They are not. Weber 9930 grates are 11.75"" x 17"" x .5"". These are 11.75"" x 19.25"" x .5"". They will not fit any of the grills listed."
5,Excellent Job,This book is full of useful examples for pretty much every single detail. Heavy but easy reading. Perfect reference book for students.
4,Paperback mistake?,"In the description of the book, I think an error was placed saying "" (Paperback - January 23, 2003) "". Check all the books by Mcmillan, and you'll see two version of Option as Strategic Investment, one is the 'book', the other, cheaper, is the workbook.The 'book' is about 2"" thick, quite heavy on the arms! The contents are precise. For each strategies, e.g. long/short call/put, spreads, ect..., Mcmillan explains their definitions, their reasons, their advantages, their pitfalls. This is purely a 'theory book'. If you have an opinion on the market (bullish/bearish/neutral), and want to see different spread strategies possible that could apply to your trading, this is a great book to read. If you want to find out what the floor traders do with your order, are they fair, or try to skim off your order, or try to manipulate the price..., you will not find it here.p.s.: (I gave 4 stars because one should never give 5 :p )"
4,From the Stock Traders Headquarters library,"This book is pricy but it's a super book. If you have any desire to learn stock options, this a must read. Stock options have very high risks and should not be traded if you are a beginnerDavid CollettiFounderStockTradersHQ.com"
4,In-depth,"I would suggest a more basic book on options before you get to this. Once you understand the ""easy"" basics this is definately your step 2 book."
3,"Lots of theory, little use in real world...","The writer(s) is a great theoretic, lot of explanations on basic option theory, unfortunately all this information is freely available over the Internet. The examples of trading strategies are so out of touch with real world option trading that 99% of them are useless. Not sure if that's because the book is fairly old by now or the author never really worked as an option trader.The book also has substantial amount of mathematical and typographical errors, even in the simplest examples, seems like author(s) did not invest much time into error proofing their book."
5,Best Options Books Ever!!!!,"I have a read Options made easy by Cohen and another unnamed options book back in high school, and this one puts them both to shame. It covers strats. in such detail. The book is about 1000 pages hardcover, it's ALOT of great info. Wonderfully written for any level investor, in my opinion. Buy this book today I assure you it's the best you'll ever read on options. I'm being serious, go to the top of your screen and click the buy now button, now."
1,Evidence of a Rip Off,"PLEASE do not waste your money on this pathetic student movie Paranormal Activity wannabe. It is a total rip off of Death of a Ghost Hunter, a film that is also amateurish but nowhere near as bad as this is. The DVD cover makes it seem like you are really going to see something scary. The only thing scary is how bad this movie is. I wouldn't even call it a movie. It's just...bad. I never thought I would recommend Death of a Ghost Hunter, but it shines in comparison to this. You have been warned, that's all I can say."
2,evidence of a haunting,this movie seems too plannd and not detailed enough if they were going fo tv show style with most of the good stuff edited out they got it
2,A Team Of Investigators ...study one too many ghosts !,"So,This starts off as a tv pilot offering for cable television.Things take a turn for the worst as the ghost stories unravel before our team of experts.There is pretty people,wiccans,skeptics,priests,and techno-geeks that had the tact to pester spirits.So,If one wanted to watch every movie like Paranormal Activity,Then here...Knock yourself out with this fix."
5,Any one can intubate,I had Dr Whitten as a teacher and she was excellent. If I could learn from her anyone can
2,don't pay for the brand name,"amazon.com sells the EXACT SAME rack under the WearEver brand at half the price. I wanted to compare the two so I ordered both. Now I know and so do you. Otherwise the rack is fine. Nonstick coating is nice. The dimensions are actual 16.5"" x 11.5"". It fits into a half sheet baking pan with a little room to spare."
3,Does not fit,"I bought this at the same time as my Calphalon 12x17 roasting pan since it was recommended and even says it can be used together. When I got them both, the rack would not fit inside the roasting pan. This could be caused by the roasting pan being out of spec, but buyer beware. It looks to be a good quality item if it would fit."
5,Needed to buy another one,This is an excellent rack. It's a nice large size and easy to clean. I've had one for years and it has worn very well. I needed to purchase a second one to hold all of the muffin tops my husband is now addicted to.
4,Well Made Cooling Rack,"I have only used this once so far. It seems to be well made, sturdy enough, and the non-stick surface does release the baked goods quite easily. Don't have enough experience to rate its durability but I am satisfied with the purchase so far."
2,The Fire Within,"The mystery here is whether there is a murder at all. There is no Miss Silver or equivalent detective to work the case. I found myself waiting for the real murder to happen, but it doesn't. The romance part is true to Patricia Wentworth mysteries; the right people get together. It's not that what happens doesn't work; it's what doesn't happen. If you are writing a thesis on Patricia Wentworth, then you probably want to read this to see how her style evolved."
2,Mastering NOT,"This book does not master anything, the author covers the basic controls of a DSLR and provides a short description of their function. The book is full of fillers to take up page space and towards the end you find yourself reading about the authors personal opinion on computer perihperals and Adobe photoshop which has nothing at all to do with mastering a DSLR."
3,Excellent Book--IF YOU CAN MANAGE TO SEE THE PRINT!,"The information is the book is excellent. I now understand how to take better pictures with my Olympus E-510 (especially the exposure controls!).But, and this is a VERY BIG but, the font of the book is T-I-N-Y! I swear that it must be 8 point type! And the captions--they are in 6 point, light type. The colors do not contrast. How can anyone be expected to read 8 point THIN white type on a gray background?The author should demand better treatment for his material. You literally have to get one of those magnifying sheets that the older people use in order to read this book.The publisher should be forced to give every purchaser a link to a PDF version of the book so that it can at least be magnified on the computer.This is the ABSOLUTE worst typographically-designed book that I have seen in 20 years. The material is great which is why I did give it 3 stars."
3,Ok manual,"I am reasonably happy with this book. Very informative on technical aspects of SLR photography. Realizing this is an evolving technology, some of the author's recommendations on equipment is a bit dated. Mainly in the computer & storage area. Otherwise good for an amateur wanting to gain knowledge of Digital SLR photography."
3,Magnify your eyes,The pictures are nice. The quality of the book is superior.The print is so small it is almost impossible to read and takes away from the reading experience
4,Great series,All the DVDs are in great shape and all features worked fine. I have been waiting a long time to get this series and I am very happy with my purchase.
2,You tube this first -Jult Warfell,This series is way bettern the first. But it was to painful to watch. Funny though it was. The story was excruciatingly hard to follow. But I dont regret owning this. But if I can get rid of it I will in a heartbeat. -Jult Warfell
4,A blast from the past!!,Here's another book I checked out of the library about 15 years ago! I really liked the plot and the way the inhabitants of the planet were described and how the main character interacted with them. There should be a sequel to this one. It's a pretty good book!
3,"nothing special, but enjoyable","A good read, but nothing special. The story seems to have been influenced somewhat by LeGuin's ""Left Hand of Darkness"", and perhaps Tolkien, but is different enough from either of those to be interesting in its own right. The writing is capable, but not superb; the story and characters are what hooked me.Average, but enjoyable."
3,Not bad!,"Checked this book out of the library because I was intrigued by the cover art. What's inside is pretty good, too. It has a nice, complex political plot -- lots of intrigue and treachery, lots of characters. It's about an envoy from Earth to a pre-technological planet. Her job is to convince these people to trade with Earth. But there have been some very basic misunderstandings on Earth's part about the aliens' culture, and their reactions are quite different than expected. I would have liked the book if the aliens were just a little more ALIEN, if you know what I mean, but the author has created a very convincing world. ""The Golden Witchbreed"" is a pretty good read."
4,"Close to classic, but not quite there","A huge journey across a vast alien world is a theme more consistent with fantasy than SF but Mary Gentle brings it off beautifully. Her aliens have a lot of 'classic' features but they still seem very fresh and real. She makes the journey emotional without ever making it sentimental, we are engaged by the envoy's travails but are still uplifted by them and personally, I found myself envious. The more she travels, the more about the history of the world we find. It's a fascinating journey, albeit a long one.If you enjoyed this, you might also like ""The Left Hand of Darkness"" by Ursula Le Guin, which shares many features with this book."
4,confort,"The most confortable pants i have worn ,i have bought several pairs for work and play, i also purchased the jeans and they too wear well.the only complaint i have is they are a little baggy in the hip area."
1,Wrangler anglers,"This product is generally my favorite summer (jean), however the khaki product I received was poorly made without quality control, or so it appeared and felt. The stride area was clearly not sewed correctly making it very uncomfortable to wear. The jean ordered at the same time were much better but almnost to short in the stride.I kept the jeans and returned the khakis."
3,Batteries Corroded,"The packaged toy came with batteries already installed. It did not make a sound or light up out of the package. When we opened the battery compartment, we found the batteries to be corroded. I sent my husband to go get new batteries. The batteries cost $10. We cleaned the elements and now the toy works well. We feel that a packaged new toy should either come with fresh batteries or no batteries at all. It was unacceptable that the batteries were corroded and the cost of the toy was $10 more due to this."
5,Brilliant!!!,"This CD is performed on an 1828 Staufer guitar from Vienna (one of only 7 that exist on earth! - though he evidently owns this as well as many others according to his site: www.AnthonyGlise.com) - unbelievable playing in correct historical style. Glise is - (in the words of Classica Magazine in Rome) ""...a true genius on the instrument and on the stage. A pleasure not to be missed!"""
4,Nice rendition of Porgy and Bess,"The main misfortune of this album is that there is a much better, Miles Davis-Gil Evans project....Otherwise this is a nice, quite swinging affair, with some fine and some very good solos, with extremely good ensemble work for a one time studio meeting of people such as Harry ""Sweets"" Edison, Charlie Shavers, Art Farmer, Bob Brookmeyer, Al Cohn, Zoot Sims, Bill Evans (!), Phil Woods, Jimmy Cleveland...It's just too far from the Davis-Evans version to get the same grade. Also, I'd like to add a nice bonus for this album: since the original master tapes were lost, collectors were contacted to provide their LPs and the best preserved tracks were used from different LPs... As a consequence, in the rich orchestral sound sometimes a slight hint of LP cracking is added, enhancing the warmness of the CD sound..."
5,Captivating for the Classicist,"I know my classical history backwards and forwards, yet although this book is an ""overview"" of classical antiquity, I was still captivated by it. It has illustrations I have seldom seen elsewhere, was concise when it came to well-trodden themes (3 pages summarizing the Iliad and the Odyssey), but expansive in less familiar territory (four pages about the grotto at Sperlonga, including four illustrations, and a sidebar). Sidebars included numerous quotes from original texts (for example next to the discussion about Helen, was a quote from the ""view from the walls"" scene in the Iliad, a quote from Aeschylus' Agamemnon where her name is connected to a form of the Greek verb meaning 'to destroy' - helein - and a scene from Christopher Marlowe's Dr. Faustus with the protagonist waxing lyrical about Helen's beauty)."
5,Panorama of the Classical World,"A great book to use before a trip to Europe and as a wonderful memory aid after a trip. Beautiful pictures, interesting info."
2,A forgettable formulaic work but enjoyable enough,"Brinker is a PI working in Tucson, Arizona. A former INS agent who worked the US border with Mexico, he retired after being shot on duty apparently by one of his fellow agents. Brinker is hired by a local wealthy businessman, Mo Crain, to look into his wife's recent murder. Brinker's investigation takes him into contact with his old border patrol and the man who possibly tried to murder him. Of course, the investigation leads Brinker into danger with, not only his own life at stake but that of the woman he loves.James C. Mitchell has written a competent but highly formulaic PI novel. There are little surprises here. The strength of the book are the characters and the depiction of the locale. The conclusion is predictable and with the obligatory scene of the villain holding the gun on the hero, the plot is very routine. Overall, a forgettable work but enjoyable enough while it lasts."
5,Glory Man's debut solo album,"Adam Pascal has one of the most amazing voices i have ever heard. Its amazing how he can perform in a range of characters and types of music, yet still keep that same charm in his style. Buy it."
2,Over rated,This was a disappointing novel from Hartley Goodweather. The story was predictable and the characters had no presence about them. The descriptions were beyond minimal and practically non-existent and he gave so many characters interesting quirks that he didn't follow through. I found it repetitive and disappointing.Jem
4,Excellent Material - handle with care,"I have had this book since the 1980 edition. It is a very comprehensive work with beautiful pictures. You need to know which family a bird is in to look it up. In other words to read about an American Robin you look under thrushes. In the descriptions of each bird, it goes into depth describing characteristics, feeding habits, nest, eggs, incubation, other names, albinism and range. It defines all terms related to birds. All are alphabetically listed. I have rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because of my edition's binding. The glue does not hold up well and sections of the book have separated from the binding. This happened quite soon after I bought my first copy and I had it replaced. The same happened to the replacement. I still recommend book this as it's material is so worth while. Just handle it with care."
3,Really big book,"This large, heavy book has extensive information about birds. It is not really a guide to look up the ones we see. Reading it from cover to cover will provide a very comprehensive education about birds: habits, physiology, variation, etc."
5,Audubon Encyclopedia of North American Birds.,"This is exactly what i needed to identify a rare species who visited my yard, way out of it's normal flight path. Very pleased."
2,"Good Sound, When it Actually Works","This CD player sounded great when I bought it. It didn't skip, had many features, and high-quality sound. However, after 3 days it abruply stopped working. you could press any button, but it wouldn't do anything. I eventually had to return it. I'm sure most of them don't mess up like that, but, if one did, so could any of the others."
4,door closer,"The Yale Security 5103BCXSB/152AL Commercial Door Closer which I purchased via Amazon.com is high quality, installed easily and works very well. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an efficient door closer for home use."
5,"A STORY OF LOVE, LOYALTY AND SURVIVAL","This story is beautifully written. Mr. Chestnutt carefully presents the two different worlds of light-skinned educated blacks and dark-skinned uneducated blacks. He shows how for both groups the Reconstruction era meant an unclear identity. He also shows how both groups are victims of circumstance, but that truth, love, and fidelity can over come those circumstances. I liked this book because as an African-American I know about the ""color"" problem among our people. I also liked it because it was a true love story and a tear jerker. I suggest you read it aloud to a literary group. It's a wonderful story."
4,Exactly as Expected,"This is just what I expected, no more and no less. It's a relatively inefficient technology, but works well for my ""sunrise simulator."" I can't give it a 5, however, due to the relatively high price and short lifetime. I suppose this will only get worse as the incandescent bulb goes the way of the typewriter..."
3,Nice Light but burns out fast.,The light from this full spectrum light is nice. But the bulbs burn out about as fast as the regular incandescent light. I won't buy this brand again.
5,This is a new edition!,"This is a new edition of the NERO Rule Book, and therefore some of the reviews that Amazon.com has placed on this page are incorrect, since they refer to the old edition. As the author of the work in question, I have asked them to remove the old reviews but they have not done so. Please understand that some of the comments you may read here do not apply."
3,Alliance Rules,Much improved system from previous editions. Like most other systems this one suffers from overgrowth in which basic rules have been split into many parts so that players may specialize their characters through skills and not necessarily role play.
3,Very interesting,- especially the Walzt-Gavottte is playfull and summes of live and fun - a bit Childrens Corner here. But some of the pieces are very etniclike and can be foreign to listen to. Though - it sounds interesting.
1,unreliable,The thermometer looks good and fits well but one minute it works then the next it doesn't. I should have sent it back!
3,Weber Replacement Thermometer - KS,"Product was received quickly and was an original Weber replacement thermometer. My first thermometer lasted about 15 years before needing replacement. The new Weber thermometer does not fit snugly in the Weber top in the manufactured holder and rotates freely thus making reading more difficult. When I tried calibrating the thermometer to boiling water, the temperature was about 5 degrees under."
1,Not Like those that come on Weber Grills,"I'm not sure what the reviewers are talking about. While it may be made by Weber, this thing just looks like a regular old meat thermometer that you stab into the meat to check the core temp. It's nothing like the thermometer that comes standard on any Weber grill, all of which have a short 1.5""stem with a round end with a wing nut to secure it to the grill from the inside. This has a 6"" stem with a sharp point, with no way to secure it to the Grill. I poked mine through the air vent on my one touch gold charcoal grill, and it's so long it reaches the grill surface, hits the meat and pokes back out. It may indeed give you some kind of an air temp inside your grill, but definitely does not look or attach like any thermometer that comes standard with a Weber Grill. Weber does not even list this thing as a grill accessory on their website. I would return it, but I've already used it."
2,Received Damaged,"I received this product and it did not work. Not sure what happened, but I was never able to use it. I would have sent it back but the wife threw away all of the packing papers."
4,"Simple, effective, seems reasonably accurate","I use this with my Weber kettle grill - I keep it stuck through a vent hole when the lid is closed to gauge the temperature inside. It was helpful this Thanksgiving in making sure the grill was hot enough to properly cook a turkey (it was, maybe too much so - with lump charcoal I got temps up to 450 or 500). Only problem: the probe part of the thermostat tended to bump against the large turkey inside, but with careful adjustment, it worked fine. The absence of plastic meant the thermostat held up well to the heat. The dual ability seems like a good touch, but I didn't test it as a meat thermometer - I already had a digital instant-read."
2,Maybe not a good as they used to be....,"I purchased (2) of these Weber 9815's to replace my Big Green Egg (BGE) Thermometer. Both thermometers registered 212 exactly when tested with boiling water (boiling water = 212).I have used one Weber 9815 on my BGE and the temperature exceeded the maximum of 550 degrees F. The Thermometer's accuracy is now off by 35-40 degrees. There is no adjustment nut for recalibration on the Weber 9815's so it's shot to #$%. I am disappointed because I have used these same thermometers in my Medium Big Green Egg I owned 10-12 years ago and they never lost their accuracy at any temp.BGE oven temperatures can quickly exceed 750 degrees F so I bit the bullet and ordered a Thermoworks thermometer that can handle high temperatures. BTW: Thermoworks is the same company that make the famous ""Thermapen"". http://amzn.com/B002GIZZWMOrdered: 1 Thermoworks Mini Handheld Thermocouple Meter and a Type K and a Plug Mounted MI Liquid/General Probe K (Range: -58 to 2012F) to go with it."
1,Weber Replacement Thermometer,"The thermometer received is defective.It immediately goes to indicate the highest heat even though the actual heat of the barbecue oven/burner is still low. It does not indicate the actual cooking heat. It is worthless to me. I want this replacement item to be replaced!I received this September 11 and wrote a complaint but have received nothing. I would appreciate some action or word.I am not writing this for other people to read, I just want to receive an accurate, working thermometer."
5,Weber,"I do a lot of barbque, use differant thermometors, will stay in touch about all the upgrades of bbq in the future,weber is the best"
5,Perfect Replacement,"I got 11 years out of the stock thermometer that came with my Weber Genesis Silver B grill (see my review for this grill here on Amazon). This thermometer is the perfect replacement for the stock thermometer. Same size, shape, fit, etc. I had to bang the old one out with a hammer, and this one slid into the hole just as easy as can be. And this one actually tells the temperature accurately, whereas the old one had quit doing that a couple of years ago. That's OK, I grill more by feel anyway.Weber is an amazing company that builds an amazing product. If you accept the fact that parts wear out over time and you are OK buying a few replacement parts here and there to keep your grill running in tip top shape, then you will be a satisfied customer because Weber provides replacement parts for more than 10 years after you bought your grill, and they're easy to come by."
5,Great,"This is exactly what I needed. Amazon had the best price and quick shipping. The thermometer seems accurate for my intents and purposes. The Weber I bought as a display model didn't come with one so as always, Amazon to the rescue. I couldn't find a better price."
5,A very good CD,"This is a soundtrack of the popular animation from manga ichigo 100%. This is the soundtrack for it coming second DVD. The soundtracks are great. The songs are sang by Mamiko Noto who played the character Toujo Aya in the animation. The first two songs are JINK WHITE, both vocal and instrumental. I like this song best, really lift you off... sort of addicted to its tune now. :PThe second song, with both vocal and instrumental is HI NO ATARU BASHO. A nice song too. The last song is a vocal recital with background music. HIMITSU NO DIARY, Toujo Aya is reciting her experience, like writing a diary.I would recommend this soundtrack to ichigo 100% fans. I like it a lot. Cheers."

5,Almighty's Best,The almighty are just a great band. Every band has their best album and this is it!!If you are an angry young man and want an album to accompany you this is it.
3,Bowed,"The non-stick quality of this product keeps it at 3 stars.The sad side of these nice backing sheets is that they eventually started bowing or warping. Yes, you can just bend them back into place to solve that problem but it continues to happen. Maybe just bad luck for my mother, who uses them mostly at her home.They seems to still have the nonstick quality to them but we only ever used a silicon spatula to remove any baked goods.My mother used to clean them in the dishwasher until I asked her to stop. The warping caused a slight gap in one of her sheets which makes it retain some water and after being dish washed they would leak, of course, but slowly after you put it away. I noticed it and had to inform her of this."
4,Had product for about 2 months or so now.,"Does make some good cookies. Even cooking like it said, it i can tell a difference between those tin foil things. I manage to scratch mine some how. Also upon arrival the sheet had some damage to it. just dented in some in spots, had to be during manufacturing process."
5,Dedicated to those beyond the main crew.,"I enjoyed reading Kevin's latest book ""Seeds of Rage"".I especially like the way he connected back to the ""Errand of Vengeance"" series and also the subtle connections made back to the original Star Trek series. The only thing I didn't care for, was that I'll have to wait for the next book. I'm looking forward to reading Part II soon."
4,Smokey Joe Platinum,"The best portable grill around. Small enough for good portability, Big enough to grill for several tailgaters (Go Chiefs). Solid construction. Finish has lasted through several seasons with no signs of wear. Suggestion: Drill a few 1"" holes in the bottom and it will breathe a little better."
3,Functional but not as advertised,"The picture and write-up give the impression that the height of this product can be adjusted. It is not adjustable, although an adjustable product is what my mother's physical therapist recommended. Fortunately we were able to make the height work as Mom's bed is adjustable, but it is annoying that the product we received was not as expected."
1,Unacceptable,The seller told me the book was out of stock weeks after it was suppose to be delivered to my apartment. He/she did refund my money.
1,You listed the wrong edition,"The edition you sent me was the 6th edition, not the 7th. I think you need to clarify in the future on the exact edition, even if the SKU number is the same."
1,Unsatisfied Customer,"I ordered this book on July 16, 2008 and I was suppossed to receive it between July 23rd and August 7th. Today is August 17th, and I have not received anything. I have tried to contact the seller on two seperate occassions (August 6 and August 11), and I have not received a response."
1,Received a different version!,"The book was great, however, I received an instructor version of the book! Because of this, I wasn't able to take it to my school's bookstore as a buyback at the end of the quarter!"
4,Relatively good textbook,"Kotler and Armstrong always produce lucid, succinct books on Marketing and Marketing Management. As a lecturer in the Business/Management area, I use these books in the course of my work.The content is good, with a lot of diagrams and flow charts, and the case studies are many, which isn't a bad thing, as it puts some of the principles into a realistic context.As for being boring- well, it's a text book!!! I'm sure there will be an 'Idiot's Guide to Marketing' out soon, which may satisfy the more facile of readers."
4,Good but nothing special,"I used this for a curriculum design class. It is very readable but not extrodinary. If you want to inspire your students, I would suggest augmenting it with selections from other books (popular books on consumer psychology,etc.) which is what I did. For a basic marketing class, it will be fine."
1,The worst textbook I have ever read,"In my opinion this book should NOT be used in colleges and universities. It is convoluted and filled with superfluous text that distracts and dilutes the existing weak content. It is poorly structured and is redundant in some areas while completely lacking in others. The fact that it costs as much as it does is shameful. What a waste of time, trees and money."
1,Book is a waste of time and money. Honest.,Marketing information is too general. Book does not deliver what it promises for the reader.
2,Worked for class but was given an illegal copy that I could not sell,"I had to purchase this book for a marketing class. The price was great, but the copy that was sent to me is an ""instructor review copy"" - the kind publishers send for free to professors who are shopping for a book for their class. The copy is supposed to be either kept or sent back to the publisher and is illegal to sell, but this is the version I recieved (with the professor's name marked out in black marker). While the book worked fine for my class, I could not get any money back on it. The campus bookstore told me to report the seller and get my money back, but it was already past the deadline to make a claim through amazon and the seller has not returned my emails in 2 months.If you get a book that says ""Instructor Review Copy"" at the top - make your claim right away and get your money back!"
3,Information somewhat outdated,"This book covers what and how marketing should work. This book ignores item such as manufactures don't offer what the consumer wants, only what the manufacturer decides to mfg. An example is all cars offering only shades of gray for interiors. Walmart telling the vendors what price they will produce their product."
4,always as a reference and as a guide,"My Profile. 43 yo (and getting beter) beginer enterpreneurbeing in sales its easy to forget the big picture and jump to the marketing context frame, where sales is a thoughtout consecuencethis book is fundamental and complete for all this those issues you are faced to deal in your everyday life... I am focusing this review on those technical product and services taht do ot fit the mass marketing comcepts, still the fundamental are herepleanty of diagrams and case studies."
5,A Reformed Romance Whimp,"All my young adult life I dated off and on. And, I wondered what the problem was with the young ladies that I dated. Why couldn't any of the relationships last more than a few months? What was their problem? After reading this book I realized the problem wasn't them. It was me and being honest about what I wanted and taking the risk to lay it all on the line. I realized that I was a big romance wimp. I began to open up and honestly share my heart, my dreams, and my wants. If I was rejected, so be it. A man shouldn't be afraid to share who and what he is with someone he would like to seek a relationship with. And, the young lady I had been dating off and on for a year or more responded like she never had before. In fact, we celebrate 12 years of marriage very soon."
4,"Not bad, with reservations","This book is a rather facile account of the murder on Nov. 23, 1849, of Dr. George Parkman, uncle of historian Francis Parkman, by a Harvard professor. This is a famous case, and this book gives all the gruesome details. Boston in 1849 was a small world and many famous persons flit thru the pages of this book: Longfellow, Melville, Charles Sumner, Edward Everett, Oliver Wendell Holmes, etc. As a true crime book I found it objectionable that the author purported to tell us what persons thought, but overall the book is not bad and holds one's interest. A shorter account of the same crime written by the famed crime writer Edmund L. Pearson can be found in the book Crimes That Shocked America, edited by Brant House and published in 1961 by Ace Books, Inc."
5,Model Power makes the best WWI die-cast models in this scale,"I own all of Model Power's World War I die-cast 'Postage Stamp' series planes. They are by far the best quality die-cast models of WWI planes you can find in this scale (approx 1:100). They paint the models rather than apply decals which can peel off. Model Power is really the only die-cast company to offer any real selection of planes for the WWI enthusiast. Other companies offer one or two models (Sopwith and Fokker Triplane usually), and they are typically inferior models with less detail and/or cheaper construction."
5,More Roadside Rockhounding Sites,Good resource for beginners; many of the sites identified in other similar books; a few good New Mexico locale for rock collecting omitted from this book.
5,My search is over...,"I had been looking for a multi-pen with a stylus for quite awhile and had given up, but decided to Google for one. The results took me to Cross' website, but I thought to search Amazon. The pen has a good quality feel to it, like every Cross product I have handled, and came in my favorite color!"
2,At this Price it Should be Better,"For the price of this pen I was expecting something more. I previously had a pen that I loved, which I was trying to replace. Unfortunately I'm still looking for it's replacement. This pen is very light and makes a slight rattling noise, which is annoying if you tend to fidget with your pen in hand. The Cross site lists the pen for $55 and at that price I assumed that quality was a given. Don't make the same mistake."
4,Amazingly simple to use,"This smoker is virtually maintenance free. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the small water pan and the lack of a thermometer. I have another smoker but this one was really easy to use. Before I bought mine, I researched the smoker and looked at websites that showed how to add a larger water pan and thermometer so I knew what I was getting. But you'd think that for the price, Weber would get a clue. Once I started smoking and got the temps up to where they needed to be, the needle on the thermometer acted like it was glued in one position. This is just an incredible smoker and if I ever need another one, I'd do it in a heartbeat."
5,Weber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smoker,"I've been able to use the WSMC three times since I received shipment of the smoker. It is easy to set up and assemble. All smokes were easy to get going. Maintaining the internal temperature is easy and effecient. This my first time with a smoker. I have a Weber Genises Grill also. It's hard to beat Webers products. If you're considering a ""smoker"", this is the one to get. There is a web site which is great for ""newbies"". Lots of help, great recipes, etc. A great buy!"
4,Still getting the hang of it...,"I've used the smoker about 5 times now. I am still getting the hang of it. My chicken comes out wonderful, tender with a great smokey flavor. I haven't had much luck with other meats. They have the smokey flavor I am looking for, but they tend to come out dry. I've even use a meat thermometer so that I don't have to open the lid, but the temperature in the cooker fluctuates enough that the meat temp fluctuates. The cooker is very handy in that it can be used as a bbq pit also."
5,Legendary,"I was just catching up on some reviews for past purchases and saw I never reviewed this purchase. Bought this as a housewarming gift for my brother 5 years ago. Didnt know alot about the wsm at the time. wow. Talk about a pandora's box of BBQ this purchase opened up. We now have a BBQ competition team and I can not even begin to estimate how many lbs of ribs, shoulder, chicken, brisket, bacon have been cooked on his. I went on to ditch my cheap offset to get a 22"" wsm because of this purchase. I totally recommend weber smokey mountains to anyone. no mater your skill range. you can set this smoker up and not touch a vent for 15hrs. not kidding. might have to add a little water if your still using the waterpan. BBQ is tough and fun, why not take worrying about your smokers performance out from the start."
4,Weber 2820 Smokey Mountain Smoker,I've only had the chance to use this smoker once since I purchased it. It performed as expected and the ribs were delicious. The smoker seems to be well made and I think it was a good buy. I do wish Weber had put a temperature gauge in the lid. I would have gladly paid a little more for a smoker with the temperature gauge built in instead of having to come up with something myself.
5,Best smoker in the world,This is the best smoker I have ever used. It truly is set it and forget it. 15 hours on one load of charcoal and 6 to 8 lumps of wood. Just make a couple minor modifications and this thing is perfect. A definite good buy at $200.
1,Weber WSM Price Increase A Rip - Off,"This is a decent piece of equipment that can produce very good BBQ. There is a learning curve though and you should not expect too much the first few times you use it. There are BBQ associations all over and you will find many people using Weber WSM's because they are good and easily portable. Go to an event, they are all advertised on the internet, and get some help which is readily available.Value is another issue. I purchased two WSM's last year, one at retail and one on the internet. Paid less than $199 each time. For Weber to increase the price to $249 without any product improvement is a rip off, pure and simple. I can't believe the price of labor in China has gone up that much to justify the increased price."
5,Awesome cooker,"I was passing the info on to a friend about this smoker an remembered I haven't reviewed this item. This smoker is great, just put your meat on it an let it do its job. It not only serves a a smoker, but works as a grill. The elevation of the trays will not allow the drippings to flash, no more burnt meat. I believe you could put a shoe on this thing and make it taste good. I bought our smoker in 2002 and it still is in good shape. The cover they provide is heavy duty as all the Weber products are. We haven't gone out to a restaurant for steak and ribs since we purchased this smoker, why bother. So save the money you would have spent at the restaurant and buy this smoker. The only thing I had to do was drill a hole in the top and install a temperature indicator that I bought."
4,Excellent slow cooker,"I am very satisfied with the Smokey Mountain cooker. It holds temperature nicely and the user's learning curve is expedited by the Cooker web site: http://www.virtualweberbullet.com/ I have found that I seem to need a bit more airflow (vents more open) than the instructions on the web site say.This is the first smoker I've had that I can confidently leave for a few hours and know it will hold its temperature. I'd give it 5 stars except for a couple things.1. Weber should equip the cooker with a good thermometer and handles on the side of the main cooker body to ease fire maintenance. The web site gives good tips for doing this yourself. Don't know why they don't put a thermometer on there, but the handles were probably nixed by lawyers who don't want customers handling a hot vessel.2. Haven't done a real long cook yet(12 plus hours)to evaluate how much fire maintenance is needed to keep temperatures steady. Minimal fire maintenance for 5 - 8 hours cooking time."
5,Best Smoker I have Owned,"If you are in the market for this type of smoker, do your self a favor and get this one. I owned two different bullet-style water smokers before this one, and neither of them compared. This one keeps the heat in much better, and isn't built as crappy as just about all the other ones. The reason is, this one is one solid cylinder, and all the parts fit nicely together. All the other ones are assembled from one piece of sheet metal, which never fits the top or bottom pieces. Go with the Weber Smokey Mountain."
1,This is the Weber Smokey Mountain #2820,But the 2820 is much cheaper!Buy the 2820 from Amazon and save.
1,defective smoker - replacement part on back order - defective replacement,"The smoker came with the procelain coating flaking off on the middle section. Although the customer service people promised to send a replacement part; they forgot to mention that the part is on back order. Also, while the lid and the bottom part of the smoker feel solid, the middle section, the front door and the legs on this smoker are flimsy - very flimsy. The front door does not fit too well either. It looks like I'll have to wait quite a bit before I can even try this thing out. This smoker cost about 3 time more then the competitors and I expect better then this.A follow-up:The replacement part came after a week. The procelain is chipped as well, although at a different place.At least Weber seems to stand behind their product. I was told another replacement will be send. Then again I was told two days later that the part is on back order.I would give this product less then one star if it is an option."
2,Not what I expected from Weber,"The 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smoker seems good on paper, but the quality is poor. The finish on mine was chipped upon arrival and chipped further upon use. The center grilling portion does not fit properly. It does come with instructions and hints, but so far, I have not been able to adjust the vents to maintain a constant temperature, and the instructions are not detailed enough to get me there. The fire is either too hot or extinguishing. Worst, the goofy door must have been designed by an accountant to save money. No self respecting engineer would put a pathetically thin and ill fitting door on a heavy cast iron (steel?) smoker.It requires nearly constant attention, but I have managed to make some pretty good food in it. I am not sure of what to buy, but I don't think this smoker is ready for market.E.B.Weber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smoker"
5,Best Ham EVER,"The more wonderful than you can believe it. Most benefit easy assembly. Gloriously to use it am being very easy. Can burn for you for very long time, you see. So simplous my pet canine can use it tho she must have help to start fire."
3,almost perfect smoker can be improved on.,"I like the sturdiness of the metal , the size and shape. It needs a temperature gauge on it to help minimize guessing and handles on the mid section for easier removal and adding foods to it while smoking. perhaps designing it so one can have easily base meats on the lower rack will also help. cooks great otherwise."
5,Great Smoker,Good quality and holds the heat well. I added some handles to it and upgraded the water pan but other than that it's a great product.
5,As good as advertised,"I have been reading about the WSM for the past year and couldn't decide whether or not to get one. Finally got one and it is even better than I thought. If you are unsure about buying one, do it now. My wife wasn't thrilled about the price, but after some chicken and ribs she is a believer."
5,First Class Blues from Bukka,"If the song titles on this cd are any indication, these are not Bukka White's pre-war recordings, but the songs he recorded for Takoma Records in 1963, the year of his rediscovery by John Fahey and Bill Barth. Bukka was just as fiery and intense in 1963 as he was in the 1930-1940 period of his first commercial recordings...and just as essential."
3,More expensive version of Jack Hamm,"The book is all right. I learned a few extra things that I didn't learn from Jack Hamm's How to Draw Animals. But I kept feeling like I was reading Hamm's book a lot. If you don't have a lot of money, Hamm's book will give you just as much for almost half the price.And both books should really be called How to Draw Mammals. There's nothing about reptiles, birds, or fish in them."
5,Drawing Wildllife,I found this book in the library and immediately knew that I had to own it. The vivid descriptions and the hundreds of detailed drawings would be an asset to anyone who wants to draw animals. The drawings are outstanding and the details are to die for. I can only recommend this book highly to anyone who draws.
4,Walkman tradition continued in FX195,"Trendy style, quality construction, good sound. Phone jack and volume control are well spaced. All switches are well placed. The battery light is very useful; it tells power is ON or OFF. Even though it's an inexpensive model, it carries Sony's original Walkman quality in every respect. Sound quality is also great. No motor vibration is detected in sound. Radio portion is also good. The only down side in this model is no auto-reverse. Highly recommended."
2,Disappointing Sound Quality,"I purchased this item in hopes of finding a good replacement to my old Emerson cassette/radio. I was very disappointed with this product. The sound quality when playing tapes is terrible. The mega bass feature is useless, there is actually more bass without it on at high volumes! Also there was a lot more fuzziness that I heard with this walkman when playing tapes. The radio portion works okay, but if you want to be able to turn the volume on your music up loud without distortion, dont buy this product."
4,great but the price is tooooo high!!!!,i bought this same am/fm stereo cassette a couple of years ago at walgreens for about $10.00 and they are trying to sell it for how much?? that's outrages!!! check walgreens or walmart or brandsmart and get a better price// this price is just too hight for this small radio // it's great but you can find this same radio for about $30 cheaper somewhere else!!!!
3,a mediocare cassette player,"I bought this a while ago, and i lost it a few weeks later problay because i didnt like it. The tuning scale is very hard to use and is not accruate at all. The tape quality is poor, and the tape head gets dirty very fast, for some reason or another. The radio quality is farily good once you master the impossible task of tuning the thing. The battery light is next to useless, and the whole tape player just isnt that good.I have bought a lot of Sony products, and i figured out that if you want the qualtity ones, get the shiny ones."
4,"A haunting, tormented memoir","Ms. Kendall is not a professional mystery writer, and each of us knows how her story will end before we even pick the book up. Yet it's engrossing all the same, because her honest, unpolished prose puts us in her shoes. She's Everywoman, a flawed single mother with many insecurities, who falls in love with the Wrong Guy (""wrong"" in an extraordinarily big way!) and we can all imagine ourselves in the same situation. The love, the guilt, the paranoia, the shame, the jealousy ... gulp. I just hope that wherever this lady is now, she and her daughter are happy and at peace."
4,the closest thing to a Ted Bundy autobiography,"After reading several other books on the subject of Ted Bundy, this book really stands apart. Most books offer a history of his crimes and trials written by outsiders. The Phantom Prince is a first-hand account of Ted's behavior and whereabouts during his pre-Florida years. For those of us with a special interest in Ted Bundy this book is full of fascinating, intimate details which provide a rare glimpse of Ted's ordinary life. (Where else can you learn what his favorite beer was?) After all, he didn't spend ALL of his time killing or running from the law. This book offers a very unique perspective on an insanely interesting case. THIS may be the closest you will ever come to a serial killer"
5,Another Great Composer Biography,"This is a great representation of George Gershwin's life. A must have for every elementary school library. It has beautiful black and white and color pictures along with cartoons enhancing the story. Hyper-sensitive schools and parents may be shocked at the first photo of the book which has Gershwin sitting at the piano with a cigar in his mouth. If everyone can get past that picture by reminding children that this was before people knew that smoking was bad for your health, then you can enjoy this great biography."
5,Cute!,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas,ended up having her look at it cause I thought it may be too small for her wrist,but it fit perfectly and she said she loved it,so it's worth around the $16 I paid and I am so glad I got it for my mom!"
1,Fraud!!! These are faker replicas (although they are advertised as being the real things),"Amazon lists several M-18 smoke bombs which are very legal and used for a variety of uses. I ordered two kits paying almost $0 in shipping lonly to find out they are fake replicas and not the real thing. Sad part is you can buy these ""toys"" for $5 at a local variety store vs the $45 (inlcuidng shipping) i paid for them.Exteremly misleading!!!"
1,"""Golden Coach"" ruined by bad mastering at end","The DVD for ""The Golden Coach"" is for the most part fine, but the final minutes, which are crucial to the full impact of the film, are ruined by deplorable mastering. The scene appears to be out of focus and the colors are washed out to the point of barely being able make out what is happening. I believe Criterion made some kind of mastering error, because Martin Scorsese's introduction to the film explicitly refers to the wonderful restored ending of the film. Criterion should withdraw the DVD and offer a replacement."
3,Renoir's post war confections,"After the constraints of the US studio system, Renoir returns to France and more freedom. But this collection, while interesting for Renoir fans in showing his movement away from 'realism' and towards more and more theatricality, is uneven. In 'Elena', even Ingrid Bergman can't save the clunky, predictable plot and the rather crass humour. 'The Golden Coach' pushes theatricality to the limit and becomes almost hysterical. The gem in the collection - and that which makes it worth acquiring - is 'French Can Can'. It too is a kind of fairy tale, but absolutely coherent and contained within its own terms. There's a toughness, even a cynicism, under the sentiment and tenderness. The frame is busy, filled with detail and life and sexiness - and Jean Gabin (France's Spencer Tracy) is as charming as ever."
3,Taug,I really liked the energy through out the book. I was so mesmerized by it I read the book in one day. Cant wait for a sequel ...
5,Well-Made Cover,"If you have a grill that this fits, it is exactly what you need. This is because rain can get into the Summit 625/650. This will keep the rain out. It fits much better than other Weber covers that I have had over the years."
1,A Closer Look At Islam and Terrorism,"Terrible book. The bias of the author is ridiculous, and unfortunately not revealed until the last 25 pages of the book. He tries to paint a picture of Islam being a terrible force of violence and evil throughout the world using a rudimentary explanation of important Islamic beliefs. Then, in the last 25 pages he gives his solution to the problem, mass conversion to Christianity. Upon further inspection I realized the publishing company, Front Line, is a very religious organization who seeks to ""spread the word of jesus christ"". If you want to gain a genuinley better understanding of this book, especially if you are reading for academic purposes, look elsewhere."
5,An Amazing Thought Provoking Journey to Truth,"Those who lowly rate this book, do so not out of scholary criticism, but because they can't take the truth it contains. It is one the best books written between the subjects of Islamic terrorism versus Christian evangelism, the missing religious dimension of the war on terror. It is succint, practical, and relavent to our time. The insights come from a scholar and thinker, who paid for his religious liberty in his own blood and persecution. Especially helpful is his comparison of English translations of the Quran (Koran) showing that ""The Noble Quran"" is more straightforward. His personal story, a faithful quest for intellectual and spiritual truth, is highly recommended to all, including those of the West who have difficulty understanding the lack of freedom of speech in Islamic nations. Those who unduly criticize this book, wish to extend that lack of freedom of speech even here!"
5,From hate to love,"I read this book with an interest in understanding the mindset of the Islamic / Terrorist tie. One thing struck me as truth. As human beings that believe in a God, we all strive to ""please"" God. Some believe in a loving and forgiving God, one that we can have peace with while we live our lives, one we can have a personal relationship with. Other people strive and struggle to please God, never at peace with God and never knowing even at death, whether they will be approved of God. God loves the Muslim as well as anyone else. Mark Gabriel made that abundantly clear in his writing. His realization that God is Love, is the transforming power that broke his hatred. An excellent book!"
1,hypocritical,"Let's be fair here.Doesn't the writer remember the crusades and the many Muslims which were killed?It is overlooked as a causefor the Christians to maintain power in Europe and in Rome.Then it's stated numerous times how the Muslims want to ""take over the world"" Don't the neocons and evangelicals want to take over the world?,and they do it by spreading Christian ""love""and deceit.The average Christian isn't an evangelical,nor do they have any desire to take over the world;neither does theaverage Muslim.The book is meant to cause a riff betweenIslam and the West.Read it with care and much thought,thenrealize it's deception.I agree with another reviewer,read the Quran,don't rely on books which are more likeonline bloggs than a real foundation in research."
1,"faithless,lies and making up stuff","well,i did read couple of things in the book,and right away it tells me this guy is a liar,if he is the man of his woed he shoud of spok up long time a go,i dislike like people with no faith,as a muslim and arab who did read the holy book i can be 100% this antichrist translated and misrepresnt our holly book,as the zionests trying to attack not only islam,but christianity as well,thank you for taking the time reading,god blessIslam and Terrorism: What the Quran Really Teaches About Christianity, Violence and the Goals of the Islamic Jihad"
1,A Blantant Crock of Excrement,"I lent this book to a PH.D. linguist; scholar in ancient and modern languages including Arabic. He is also an accomplished bible expert and has authored many texts teaching translators to translate major segments of the bible to various languages. He is a Christian of 85 plus years. He suggested I take one of his copies of the Quran and check out, for starters, the author's claims on pages 4 and 5 of the book. I did that and I encourage anyone else unfortunate enough to have purchase this package of pig swill to do the same. You can easily prove for yourself using the aurthor's own material that he is a brazen lier. The Rev. Bruce H. Yurich, PH.D., Dean of Florida Christian University is likewise a low deciever for having endorsed this pile of hate propaganda."
4,The Politically Incorrect Truth About Islam,Arm yourself with the facts. A book anyone can and everyone should read. Fair. Factual. Well-documented. Not the sugar-coating you get from the mainstream media.
5,THE BEST ON ISLAM,NO GETTING ARROUND IT THE IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OUT THAT SHOW HOW A FREE COUNTRY MAY NOT SURVIVE UNDER ISLAM RULE-THE ONLY THINK ITS LACKING IS HOW THEY TREAT WOMEN
5,Must read for everyone who searches for the root cause.,"Mark Gabriel does a masterful job at shedding light on the root of all evil, Islam! This essay is written from a judeo-christian perspective and shares insight into the life of Muhammad, early centuries of Islam, and its modern day out reach. Gabriel's scholarship is second to none. This book was distributed to western troops while deployed in the lands of Islam. A must read for all who seek understanding."
1,Excellent Book to fool Christians,"this is an excellent book to fool christians, because christian know that all billions of christians trying their best to defame Islam for 1400 years yet Islam is fastest growing religion, and the most coverts are Christians women. Christians can read Quran themselve to see if the writer is talking truth, and they can read and see the historical churches in Muslims countries, if the writer is correct there would not be any christians and churches in muslim world, this is a clear proof that the auther is mentally sick and retarded. Our prophet said it is enough for a person to be a liar if he/she listens from someone and without making sure if it is authntic, it passes on the statement to others"", Go and search your self rather than reading a book and believing in it, it is same as seeing Hitler and thinking this is christianity."
5,"Simple, happy, unassuming fun for young readers","The Boo and Baa books are a delight! They have that incredible Scandinavian quality (think Ingmar Bergman) of restrained dignity. My children love Boo and Baa at Sea especially, for its sense of play. Each Hemingway-esque one liner is bound to bring a laugh. A great learn-to-read book."
2,"Nice product, bad price","I got this set a year or two ago on sale at Home Depot for a clearance price of $5. Mostly, I use the tongs because they do the work of tongs and spatula thanks to the unique mini spatula shapes. The big spatula is fine, and the fork, but the tongs are most useful, so I usually skip the other two. It's a great value at a $5 price, but there's no way I'd pay $35, especially since I use mostly one tool. If I paid that much, I'd want some extras like basting brushes or a grill rack for vegetables or fish. Shop around."
2,"Not what I expected, or worth the price","While Weber is a trustworthy name in grilling, I would definitely not recommend this tool set. The set appears to be very cheaply made - the handles are entirely wood, unsupported by any stainless steel in the actual handle. The stainless steel working end did not appear to be heavy duty, and where it connects to the wooden handle will be very difficult to clean. There definitely are significantly better tools on the market for a much better price. I gave this as a gift to my husband and was very dissapointed in the quality."
1,They should not have been able to put the Weber Name on this,I was very disappointed with these products. Not well made and not user friendly.Weber should be ashamed they put their good name on this product.
1,"""Old"" Version of Tova Signature is LONG GONE","They are just not making the original version of Tova Signature; I heard that QVC bought the company from Tova Borgnine a few years ago and just RUINED THE FRAGRANCES. Many of her loyal fans would have paid ""mucho"" for her to keep making the original formula...I used it for many years and just LOVED IT, received MANY complements...but, NO MORE. The ""new"" fragrances have cheap oils, too much alcohol, and smell like ""bug killer"" or nothing at all! Horrible...don't waste your money. There are still a few bottles of the ORIGINAL SIGNATURE (Black cap as pictured here)on EBay, but selling for $350-400.00...crazy! EBay sellers ""caught on"" quickly...not many bottles left for all the fans of the REAL Signature scent!"
5,Botanica's ORCHIDS,"This is an excellent book and should be in the home of any orchid enthusiast that enjoys species. There are over 1200 species listed with color photos. This helps make identification much easier.Since I have had my book for only a few days it is still in excellent condition but others I know who have purchased this title have had a problem with the paper cover coming loose. Also, some of their pages have seperated. Hopefully the quality of this one will be better but even if not then I would purchase it again."
1,Not what I wanted,I hate this product. It's more like a toy tambourine than one I can use it church. It sounds like some tin cans!
1,Disappointment,"I love the idea of a retractable doorsweep! But this one is not engineered well. After being installed, when the edge of the sweep hits the door jamb,it's supposed to push it sideways, which also pushes it down, flush against the threshold. It pushes it sideways as designed, but the end that's being pushed needs to slide down the door jamb so that the rubber gasket is flush all along the bottom of the door. Therein lies the problem, without sliding down the door jamb, I end up with the movable piece moving downwards toward the threshold on one end, but it's stuck in the up position on the other end (yes, I did install the little metal flashing piece on the doorjamb). As a result, I get no draft protection whatsoever! I'm trying to contact the manufacturer now - hoping they will provide trouble shooting assistance, or maybe product replacement. I'd think twice before purchasing this product again."
1,"M-D Building Products 7039 Seal-O-Matic Door Sweep, 36 Inches, Aluminum","I concur with the other neg. reviews. The product as delivered contains 3 spring-loaded cantilever arms that are supposed to force the lower weatherstripped bar downward against the threshold. That might work as designed on a full 36"" door. Mine was 32"", and when trimmed to length, the third arm was deleted. Thus, a length of the movable weatherstripped arm is left without any direct action to push it downward against the threshold. In addition, the actuating end with the nylon button didn't always move downward. This prevents the door from closing. BTW, it's also flimsy. The idea here is a product that should work automatically without issues. Skip this one and save your money. Right idea, wrong execution."
3,Good book with significant flaws - regarding a very important war !,"There aren't NO footnotes to this Cassell edition of this important book. It is indeed sad - and very unprofessional - that an otherwise very good book of this level of narrative detail would omit its reference sources. Additionally, the narrative detail is degraded by the poor quality of maps provided. The maps in this book are of such extremely poor quality, they provide barely enough detail to orient yourself to the flow of combat. As a result you cannot adequately envision a lot of of important details regarding the conduct of operations. If you can locate some independent maps, the narrative detail is much more meaningful. Most people are highly ignorant regarding the importance of this war in regards to the military operations througout the 20th Century. Both of these significant inadequacies (no sources and poor maps) in this edition only exacerbate our lack of knowledge regarding this important war."
4,Poor leadership costs lives,"A very good look at the Russo-Japanese war. The Russian ground forces had many chances to win but poor training with even worse leadership threw them away. The Russians were good at defense but it was a case of ""almost won"". This war in fact started the downfall of the military that fell in world war one. They were not ready for the next war. This war started Japans case of ""victory fever"" that ended in world war two. A good book on a little known subject."
4,Wow better then I thought.,Not your average hero.......... Enough to get you in. And not to kiddy to make you annoyed of it.... All in all a very well told stories hope to see more of it. That's all I can say without spoiling it.
2,Problems with the first chapter...,"Ok, I haven't read this book. I've only looked at some of the content online.I have a lot of respect for Mr. Nye. He has done an excellent job making science entertaining. So, I was surprised that in the first chapter where he explains how airplanes fly, he uses the Bernoulli principle as the primary explaination. There are a lot of subtleties in how airplanes fly and Bernoulli is certainly one of them - but the primary explanation has more to do with Newton than Bernoulli. [...]I'm particularly surprised that Mr. Nye would use this simplistic (and mostly wrong) explanation as he is an ex-Boeing engineer and should know better! If this chapter is representative of the rest of the book, then I'm disinclined to purchase or recommend it."
4,Great Deal...,I have been using Samsung CD media for some time now and they real are great quality to price ratio. It is very difficult to actually quatify the quality of the CD-RW/CD-R media but when you work with them for some time you somehow realize which is better.
4,More to Life Than Money,"I found this to be a very inspiring read.What I liked about the book wasn't necessarily the business / marketing aspect of it, but rather the ""life"" aspect to it.Creating a business around your true passions and interests is the path to true success, the money is just the icing on the cake.Brian T. Edmondson"
2,Poor plot,"I love chick flicks and this was dry to me. not Aniston's best performance. if you want a touching love story, look elsewhere. the plot really kills the film (and the acting does nothing to save it)"
1,unhappy customer,"I bought this used, claim was it was in very good condition but it is not. It skips. Will never do that again!"
5,Helpful,I found this movie to be extremely helpful in the time I needed support the most. My little brother died obout a month ago. When I came home from the funeral this movie was in my mailbox from Netflix. I didn't even realize it was partly about letting go and taking the time needed to mourn the loss of our loved ones. I'm so thankful for watching this movie.
3,"Lukewarm, But A Study on Grieving.","This film worked as a study in grief. The characters were sensitive, tried real hard, and worked through some heavy stuff. The idea of a bestselling author/speaker running seminars on grief when he had a few not-so-hidden bones rattling around in his closet was very intriguing. And I really liked the way it all played out.What didn't work for me was the Eloise (Aniston)/Burke (Eckhart) romance aspect. I didn't understand why, in the midst of his struggle/depression, he became so passionately fascinated with her. I also didn't understand much of their relationship overall and why there was such interest on both sides. Many of their moments together just felt painful.There was no sex but there were a few token comments. Overall pretty clean with some moderate language. If you like introspective relationships or exploring the fascinating world of mourning, or Eckhart or Aniston you might like it. I'd suggest a rental first if you are unsure."
2,When does love happen?,Not at all what I expected. Actually a little disappointed. Not much of a romance!
1,HATED IT!,"Most of the movie was enjoyable, not good but mildly enjoyable, until they set a Cockatoo (a tropical, warm weather bird) free in a damp, rainy, foggy, winter, Pacific Northwest forest. The movie was ok up to that point. Don't get me wrong, I'd never watch it again but it was a pleasant movie to that point, but after they set the parrot free, I HATED the characters, didn't care if they lived or died, and saw no point in finishing the movie. My husband continued to watch it and at the end I heard Martin Sheen greet the parrot home. What a bunch of ____ing nonsense. As one person wrote, ""It's not a homing pigeon!"" That parrot would have died long before it would have found its way home. I don't know if it would have frozen to death first or died of starvation first but I'm certain it would not have survived. They ruined an ok movie.HATED IT, HATED IT, HATED IT!P.S. It's not a comedy."
1,Animal Cruelty,"I'm a fan of Jennifer Aniston and I thought her performance was great in this movie. I would probably have given the movie 3 or 4 stars.But just as I was enjoying the movie there is this scene with setting his dead wife's parrot free. I'm thinking what? Setting a tropical bird free in Seattle to fend for it self? Yes I know the bird used in the movie was not harmed or set free for real. But what kind of message is that to give your audience. It's ok to send a tame tropical bird out in nature. A bird who has lived it's whole life in a cage. It would have no chance of surviving in the wild. Especially not in a climate it does not naturally belong to.I think they could have left out the thing with the parrot, and used something else for their plot the parrot was used for."
2,Really???,"So, I couldn't get past the setting the tropical bird, caged since birth, lose to fend for itself in a place like Seattle. What?"
1,Gay-okay,"LOVE HAPPENS should be titled WHAT HAPPENED?, as in what happened to the careers of Jennifer Aniston, Aaron Eckhart and Martin Sheen? For the final scene fag-out where everyone's crying, the actors probably were anticipating the reviews or thinking about the dinner theater work they will be lucky to get after being in this career-killing gay-fest. When Martin Sheen hugs Aaron Eckhart, I think he whispers, ""Well, at least I have enough money saved. Don't know what you're gonna do, Aaron."""
1,Irresponsible film - NEVER release parrots into the wild!,"The movie was okay, your typical rom-com. I hated the idea of releasing the parrot into the wild however. It is extremely irresponsible to release a pet parrot into the wild because they usually die. Watch the movie but ignore that idea!"
3,Love Happens,"I watched this when it came, but can't remember too much about it. These slow romantic comedies are usually not too interesting, although every once in a while you get one that's really good. This isn't it. I do like Jennifer Anniston though."
3,Just not enough,"As a male movie fan of ms. Jennifer Aniston, I was a bit disappointed in the film. Her films are formulaic, always with her being unappreciated until the end, when she finds a love interest, even if the guy truly is unworthy of her.My message to you: if you're a rabid fan, buy this. If not, skip it.My message to Jennifer's agent: take a risk, take a challenge. Show us more of her acting range, more of her acting talent, and, to be blunt, more of her. She is gorgeous, and we want more of everything...now..."
3,Is it possible to ever stop grieving our losses?,"A man, who helps people cope with their losses, must face his personal denial of pain. It is a touchingly sweet movie but the idea of making it a romantic comedy was decision made by a vacant mind. The jokes are not funny and Aaron Eckhart is awkward whilst when trying to be funny. The mistakes can be overlooked, and the movie can be worth watching, considering the excellent topic and Jennifer Aniston's performance."
3,Love Happens,"Burke is a motivational speaker who's book about dealing with grief is a best seller. His wife died in a car accident three years ago. He's in Seattle to lead a week-long workshop on healing and to negotiate a major multi-media deal. But something's amiss: he's a closet drinker, he won't ride elevators, his moods swing, he's estranged from his wife's father, and he's very much alone. In a hotel hallway, he bumps into a woman arranging flowers, tries to chat with her, and gets the brush-off. She's Eloise, a local florist who's just broken up with a boyfriend. He's persistent and they eventually go to dinner and it goes badly. There are some smiles during the movie, but it is actually a light drama dealing with bereavement and grief. I thought this movie was ok. I thought Aaron's character was interesting. However, Jennifer was just Jennifer."
1,Dreadful,"This was a dreadful movie. I am a fan of cheesy, frothy romantic movies, but this was just bad. It tried so hard to be something so much more and fell so flat. There was so little spark, so little believable dialogue and/or character development, that I found myself just wishing it would end. I waited for a long time for it to get better, but by the time I realized that was never going to happen, I probably had ten minutes left to go. To make it worse, those last ten minutes were painfully slow and insultingly stupid. DO NOT RENT.Go rent (500) Days of Summer, that was a lovely little surprise of a movie!"
2,S**T Happens,"I'm sorry, I usually don't like to speak negatively of something which people worked very hard to produce, but this just didn't make it for me. This film started out with much promise but devolved into a formulaic and not very interesting yawner. The main problem, I believe, was that there just wasn't any chemistry between Jennifer Anniston and Aaron Eckhart. The both give it the old college try, as does Charlie Sheen, who was convincing in his role. Maybe it was the script. All I know is that the gears never meshed in this.It would've been better if someone had taken the money it took to create this and sent it to Haiti instead!"
3,Complicated love.,"Love Happens starring Aaron Eckhart and Jennifer Aniston is an unusual romantic comedy. This movie has an interesting subplot but it was hard to take this flick seriously because the chemistry between the two leads was very contrived. I just didn't feel like the couple belonged together, they had nothing in common. The only major delight was Judy Greer - she is such a special, scene-stealing actress...love her. Love Happens was a mixed bag for me."
3,Kind of....,"I looked forward to this movie coming out on DVD and I was a little disappointed that the preview and trailer were a lot better. They made the movie look funny, but it really wasn't."
2,"Very weak movie, zero chemistry between stars","My wife and I just watched this movie, and we agreed that it was a very weak effort. We both like this kind of movie, we both like Aaron and Jennifer but there was just no chemistry between them at all, and we did not come to care about either character they played. Neither character seemed to have any substance to them, just one or two obvious traits for the plot to develop. It's a barely passable movie. If you're really desperate for another romance movie, I suppose it can pass the time OK, but I can't recommend it. John Carrol Lynch, Dan Fogler, and Judy Greer were all more interesting to watch than the leads, who seemed to be going through the motions."
5,Sun light,Nice sun-light like lite - a perfect choice for my room - a lot like the sun coming up in the early AM
2,Noticable editations,"Every episode has been edited and these episodes were shown this way as part of the late 70's syndicated series Fred Flintstone & Friends. Obviously, the original prints from the series have been lost or they just didn't bother to look for them.The series is good, but this is just another set of a series edited/cut down."
4,Classic Cartoon,I just finished watching the series a few days ago. It was as I remembered as a kid. If you like the Flintstone series it is a good companion series.
4,Cute,"If you remember this show from your growing up years like I do it is cute. My daughter has enjoyed watching it to see the ""grown up"" Pebbles."
5,"Yabba Dabba Groovie!! A Long Awaiting Hanna Barbera's Vault, Now to Own on DVD!!","Greetings from Lima-Peru (South America):Finally; it's here a very long awaiting release on DVD: Pebbles & Bamm Bamm and all the gang!I enjoyed the original soundtrack with the spanish version so much (dubbed in Mexico in that same time with very famous and talented voices) that I really hope this DVD has the spanish audio as well!Hopefully it'd also have a ""Play music videos only"" option for playing the animated clips of the Bedrock Rockers that sparkled each episode!Yabba Dabba Groovie!!Cesar DominguezLima, PeruMy Homepage: http://es.geocities.com/infoperuorg"
3,Poor sequel to a classic series.,"This was a poor sequel to the Classic Flintstones series, it once and for all convinced me that Hanna-Barbera had lost their touch. When I would watch these uninspired stories as a child I would wonder what happened to the people who brought us the original series. And the awful synthesized music soundtrack was dreadful. The characters were dull, the stories were routine.To be fair, Hanna-Barbera did come up with a better sequel a decade later with the Fred and Barney Show. So the well of ideas was not dry, it just was not used for this series. Those giving 5 stars based on their memory could be disappointed when they see the show again."
5,Great Fun,"I had alot of fun reliving my childhood watching this show after all these years.A lot of people on here are expecting to buy this for The Bedrock Rockers musical segments but The Bedrock Rockers weren't on The Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show. Pebbles, Bamm Bamm and their friends appeared as The Bedrock Rockers on THE FLINTSTONES COMEDY HOUR, which premiered a year after this show went off the air. The 4 bonus episodes on this collection only include the story segments and not any of the musical segments. We'll have to wait until Warner Bros. decides to release THE FLINTSTONES COMEDY HOUR to get the musical segments featuring The Bedrock Rockers.P"
2,Disappointing,"I received this DVD a few weeks ago and I have never been so disappointed with a purchase. One of the main reasons I bought it was to hear the songs of the bedrock rockers. Not one!!! Why was this cut out of the show???? Why aren't the selections in the special features???? Very , very disappointed!! Alot of these videos are posted on youtube but I thought with the purchase of the actual DVD I would have all the performances. I just can't believe they are cut out of the entire DVD.....I cannot express just how disappointed I am!!!"
4,Flintstone Fan....,"If you are a fan at all, you will love the DVDs... as a kid I loved the Flintstones and this just continues the series.."
3,Perhaps too sweet,"Candy is good. I was thinking it was more pepperminty....but it is not. Tastes good though. Good ole fashioned-like candy, especially if you have a big sweet tooth."
4,These were pretty good,We ordered these for a conference for the check-in table. Served their purpose. People liked them. Nothing too special but pretty good.
5,track dots,this is a good piece that you can make your own custom tracks on. it is also good for rc drift cars to practice with
4,Useful,"Recently took an Interior Design class and this book has been very helpful to understand color in decoration. The pictures a little old so it could be great if the authors update it. The theory, very useful though!!!"
4,Sizzling hot!,"Nancy Warren's By the Book sizzles from cover to cover. When Shari Wilson discovers Luke Lawson, her hot neighbor, with a book called Sex for Total Morons: A How-To Guide, she cannot hide her disappointment. How could someone so gorgeous need a sex guidebook? But Luke is no inexperienced dud. It's all part of a master plan to seduce the beautiful and sensual Shari...By the Book is as funny as it is steamy. There are some comic moments in the novel. This is a great installment from the Blaze series. The author does a good job developing the characters, storyline and sexual tension between the protagonists. I highly recommend this little gem..."
1,"Buy the CD, but not this VHS","The video was boring. It was nothing but an immature mockery of the monastic lifestyle. I'm a big fan of educated parody, but ignorant parody is just dumb. To do it well, they should have done their homework. This looked like it was hatched by a bunch of juvenile delinquents during after-school detention. Not witty. Not fun. Stupid. Insulting. Beavis and Butthead could have done much better.Fortunately, I spent only fifty cents on it at a used bookstore sale.ON THE OTHER HAND... I've had the CD for many years and have enjoyed it myself and watching the look on unsuspecting friends' faces when they hear it for the first time.CONCLUSION: Buy and cherish the CD. Pass on the video.(review was actually by Matt)"
1,What happened to Linda Howard?,"I have been a fan of linda howard since i read Mr. Perfect 3 years ago. I have every book she has out and have never been disappointed, untill now. If you are a fan of Linda Howard and don't want to be disillusioned about her work, run when you see this book. The story was trit, boring and predictable. The characters were wooden and one dementional. I'm not trying to be mean but the herione is a sniveling idot with so many character flaws no one could like her. Though the hero was intriging, the herione make the story unbarable. And dear readers the other stories were not any better either. Anne Major's story had the most annoying, self-serving herione I have read about yet. Susan Mullery story, although seem to be the best story, I have lots of books with a similar story line. I have not finished reading this book, it will sit on my bookshelf forever a symbol of my disappointment in my favorite author."
2,Self Fulfilling prophet,"Kubler-Ross would lead us to believe that her powers of intuition--especially when it comes to the subject of death--are superior to the rest of us. Through the lectures reprinted in this book she demonstrates many things, including magnificient compassion, intellect, humor, self-awareness and strength; but her contstant claims of intuition (especially with children, who cannot communicate at an adult level even when not dying) do nothing but fulfill her own views of the dying process. And when she is wrong in some way (a patient dies sooner or later than she intuited), there is always an unverifiable emotional or psychological argument for the patient's defiance of her claims. She is not a scientist; or, at least not a very good one, and this book put me off as I struggled to deal with my dying father's situation because of her obsession with proving how clever she was."
4,PHILIP HAMMONS REVIEW # 2,"I've already reviewed this horror movie but I want to review it again. Howling V - The Rebirth is my favorite horror movie EVER!!! The soundtrack is very eerie and spooky, and the plot is great too. However, if the werewolf would have been shown just a little bit more and had the acting been a little more convincing, this film may have been a classic. This movie does seem to take its plot & story a lot more seriously than most films of its kind, but that's why I like it."
4,Entertaining.,"Enjoyable (1989) Howling entry. The title has nothing to do with the content of the film.The terror begins when a group of 'famous' people are gathered at a castle (in Hungary) that has been shut for ... 500 years. The opening scenes are well made, especially the bus ride... & the shots of the cemetery. The acting is average, the atmospheric set is great, the only let down is that the werewolf is only shown in shadows. Ok soundtrack.One of the best in the series."
3,"FANGS, CLAWS & FLAWS","I was pleasantly surprised from the very beginning of this film. I thought it would be direct-to-video nonsense but it has good direction trapped within the constraints of a tiny budget, most of the budget being spent on the location. They shot it in beautiful Romania I believe, inside an ancient castle. The things this flawed film has going for it are, a long & brilliant opening credits sequence set in ancient times, an excellent innovative score and its location, with many beautiful snow-filled shots outside of the castle (maybe it was CGI, not sure). The acting is uneven as usual, Victoria Caitlin and Anna Stavin are my favorites. The typical dumb blonde girl is played by Elisabeth She. And the ending, most people would not figure it out..."
4,Ten little Indians and a werewolf,"HOWLING V: THE REBIRTH (1989, 96 minutes)Shot in an actual Hungarian castle, the plot is borrowed from ""The Beast Must Die"" (1974) wherein a group of people spend the night in a huge European estate while one of the party, a werewolf, systematically butchers the guests. It's basically a whodunit a la Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None."" It's also reminiscent of the underrated ""Devil's Nightmare"" aka ""The Devil Walks at Midnight"" (1971), albeit not as good.Still, it comes close, and although the werewolf is barely seen I found this a solid low-budget mystery flick with a werewolf. Besides, Elizabeth Sh√© (Marylou) has an exceptional scene and there's a superb gothic score. But gorehounds who want to see loads of bloody werewolf action should pass (there's a little, but not enough to appease modern gorehounds).GRADE: B-"
3,Dream River,"I adore Dorothy Garlock, and her writing because of the era she mostly chooses to write about. However, romance is not always going to win, and sometimes I feel I know the answer before I finish her book. Still love her writing though!!"
4,Very good.,I like the story of rain and and Amy. It was very spirited. Also Gavin and Nora was a good side story.
3,very thin towel -- but no lint,"These are very thin ""tea towels"". They are great for drying wine glasses, etc. Don't expect a thick fluffy towel, but you can also rely on it to dry effectively without leaving lint. They wash fine, but they would need ironing to look really good hanging in the kitchen -- I don't know about you, but I don't have either the time or the inclination to iron my kitchen towels..."
5,To Victory!,"I was so blessed by reading this book and acting on what I learned. Instead of hopelessness, you will find hope; instead of inaction, you will know how to take action in targeting your prayers for others, yourself, and any situation. You'll be encouraged to take God at His word! You will recognize that our battle is not against people or visible things, but against the principalities and powers behind people's actions and circumstances.This is also a great book to give to someone who is fighting a life-threatening illness and needs encouragement from the Holy Spirit."
1,Needs more biblical evidence,"I brought this book really excited thinking I was going to get a biblical approach to fight spritual warfare. However, I felt that the author bends the scripture to match his personal belief. I often felt that the scripture used did not support his comments. I felt I needed to read this book with caution using the word of God to guide me."
3,just ok,"The author gave a plug for his book on tv and made it sound like it was a super motivator for us procrastinators who have been called to do something but have dropped the ball. The cover and title went right along with his plug Aplus for all that, however, the book comes nowhere close to delivering what is promised."
5,Excellent! A must read.,"This book is very revealing of the state of the church today. The Christian church and it's passivity need to be addressed and we need to live ""radically"" for Christ Jesus our Lord!"
1,Not as stated!,I purchased this men's oval bangle for myself and to get to the point ...it was too small!A detailed decription would be helpful instead of one size fits all.Saying one size fits all inplies that it runs larger than normal however in this case it seemed to run smaller.Don't know if this was helpful...good present a child an adult no!
5,A True Sanctuary For Everyone,"The film is AMAZING! Lisa Gerrard is still an angel, actually even bigger now. She talks about her career, her life, and longings and what motivates her. It's an intimate portrait always dignified of one of today's most incredible artist. I highly recommend it to every fan of Dead Can Dance."
3,Expected a lil more,"Not sure I liked this as much as I thought I would. How the interviewing voices overlapping music & sound effects got in the way. The fast paced edits & bizarre visuals at the beginning were odd. Interviewing Lisa in various settings like the fern forest, the freeway underpass, & in her home, was a very nice presentation."
1,one star is too much,I felt totally ripped off by this CD. This was presented as something simular to what I had purchased in the past. Nothing could be further from the truth. No music of value and alot of documentary that I had no interest in at all.
2,a little too dark for my taste,"Dearly Beloved is an historical romance by Mary Jo Putney. Now then, I love some of her historical romances -River Of Fire,Shattered Rainbows (Fallen Angels), andOne Perfect Rose (Fallen Angels)are among my all time favorites Regencies. But this book was a little too grim for my tastes. The fact that the hero rapes a very young virgin in the opening chapter was a big turn off. The fact that this isn't even the darkest/worst thing in his life was an even bigger turn off.Some of the sex scenes between the hero and heroine were very well done, quite hot, as I would expect from Putney, and I liked the heroine a lot, but I was never able to get over that rape scene (or the even worse thing that happened to the hero that I do not want to spoil).I had a hard time believing this came from the same author who wrote such a sweet love story asOne Perfect Rose (Fallen Angels)"
2,Questionable Plot From One of My Favorite Authors,"I'm a big fan of Mary Jo Putney and have read nearly everything she's written, from Regencies to contemporaries (although I must admit I like the original Signet versions of her Regencies better than the sexed-up retellings). However, I found the plot in this book difficult and did not think the characters reacted in realistic ways to occurrences. SPOILER: No matter how wonderful and forgiving a person you are, falling in love with and forgiving someone who raped you when you were 14 after a forced wedding and abandoned you, never trying to find out what happened to you afterward, is unlikely. Forgiving and continuing to love someone with whom you're in a relationship as an adult who tries to violently rape you *again* is even more unlikely. Putney tried a similar forgive-the-rapist plot in a contemporary (The Burning Point) and I didn't like that version, either."
2,Disappointing,"This was my 2nd MJP book. After reading The Bargain, I was looking forward to Dearly Beloved but I basically had to force myself to finish this book. I found many of the several plot twists and subplots to be excessive, distasteful and exploitative. Really, is it necessary to incorporate rape, incest, sadism and prostitution (etc.) into one little story? I was very turned off by much of this. That said, I did think that the homosexual subplot was handled with sensitivity. Finally, I just couldn't bring myself to like the two main characters or find their actions and responses to be even remotely realistic. I will probably give MJP another try since I enjoyed The Bargain, but this time I will definitely get her books from the library, not the bookstore."
1,I couldn't get through the book!,"It is so sad when I can't get through a romance novel... I thought the setup of the story was good with the abandoned/raped wife trying to seduce her own husbnad, but somehow I couldn't get through the courting and deception part of the story when the heroine was in London being beautiful and all. I also found it odd that the hero would be so incrediblly upset and resentful of her once he found out who she really was... I didn't get that at all. I skipped along the middle of the book to get to the end of the story. I threw the book a way after I was done."
3,"Not her best, but an entertaining read","No MJP's best book by any means, but still a good read for a quiet winter weekend. The reaction of the hero to Diana's identity was little weird. That is what detracted from an otherwise OK book."
5,AP Statistics Teacher,"As a first year AP Statistics teacher with a large time gap since my college level Statistics courses, I found this book to be the perfect solution for simplifying concepts and providing good foundation examples. I have been compiling notes from several different textbooks and I always come back to this book. I would recommend it to any teacher or student as an excellent resource."
3,"Decent product, bit overpriced","This item came in alot faster than anticipated with the free shipping. Installation was a breeze. It could have been cut a lil better for a more snug fit but overall it still fits pretty well and looks great.I also thinks its vastly overpriced for what it actually is. All it is is glossy black waffle board cut to fit your grill. In my opinion it shouldnt cost more than 20.00.All hardware included, easy to follow installation directions, no tools or additional hardware required.Even though it was overpriced, in my opinion, its still a pretty cool lookin cosmetic upgrade for fairly cheap when you figure the cost of most other cosmedic mods avail for vehicles."
2,A collection of disgruntled essays with no insight.,"I didn't get much out of this book. I was hoping for some insight as to why our standard of female beauty is to be stick thin, blonde, have very big boobs, and a tiny nose. How did Barbie's real life counterpart Pamela Anderson get to look that way? Boob and nose surgery, peroxide, and starvation. Why would men consider that beautiful? I was puzzled, but didn't get any answers from this book. It was a collection of essays by mostly angry women with very specific situations - like being gay or obese, that I couldn't relate to. I guess I was looking for a Beauty Myth (Naomi Wolf) of the 90's, since the situation has only intensified, but I would recommend that book if you want a more in depth discussion of this phenomenom."
5,"Terrific, Spirited, Fun!","""Adios Barbie"" is a breath of fresh air -- at last, young women challenging the ridiculous narrow Barbie body ideal. The essays are personal, hip, funny and touching. A great gift for teens."
4,Excellent book for Masons and Antique Collectors.,"A very attractive book. While a reader will learn something of the history and customs of Freemasonry, this is primarily a picture book of items connected with Masonry, from ritual furniture and regalia used in lodges to decorative objects for the home. A great example of the the penetration of Freemasonry into the cultural fabric of our nation's past."
5,"Very beautiful, informative and entertaining.","""The American Diner"" is a delightful book that maintains the high standards Michael Witzel has always set for himself. Very beautiful, informative and entertaining. Chock-full of outstanding images from photographers like Pedar Ness, Ronald Saari and Howard Ande.There are many excellent sidebar stories, including one on Jerry Berta's DINERLAND in Rockford, Michigan.

4,Increase the capacity of your BBQ cooker,"It seems like you can never cook enough barbecued ribs to satisfy family and friends. With the help of a Weber rib rack, you can squeeze a few more slabs into your cooker to keep everyone happy.This is a pretty standard unit, but well made in typical Weber fashion. The nickel-plated finish makes for easy cleanup. I'd like to see a larger capacity model, but you can always buy two of these if you have room for them in your cooker.Works great with ribs, but less so with chicken, at least in my experience. Uncooked chicken halves slide in easily, but may become stuck in the slot once cooked.One tip: this unit holds four slabs of ribs, but if you're careful you can lean a fifth slab up against the front of the rib rack."
3,"Useful, but there are probably better","I bought this rack to use in the Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker Smoker. Though it is useful, the rack is a bit flimsy. I would rather have one with a more solid feel - the wire is not that thick. Also, the gaps for the racks are a bit small. I often have trouble pulling baby back ribs out of one or more of them, and sometimes the ribs touch each other (not a functional problem, but visually the ribs don't look as good - touching the meat together makes it look spotty in those places). It is functional and is relatively straightforward to clean up. But I would hunt around and find one that has a more solid feel."
2,Not very helpful,"I normally BBQ 8-9 racks of ribs at once, for our annual party. Thought that this Weber rib rack would make it easier. However, I found that it was more of a hinderance than a help. I like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce, several times, so I have to remove them from the rack for basting. Getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain. If you're going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook, then it might be useful. But, that's not me, so I gave my Weber Rib Rack to my brother-in-law."
2,"OK for baby backs, but...","too flimsy for beef ribs or full racks of pork ribs. Slots are narrow, so have to alternate if ribs are thick. I usually have to use two side-by-side for full racks. Had a couple welds break as well. Buy something sturdier if you smoke full racks, you'll be glad you did."
3,Good Rack,"Rack is nice for cooking 2 or more racks of back ribs. Doesn't work great for spare ribs that fold over and block proper heat and smoke transfer. I use them in a Weber Summit gas grill with no problem. Durable, easy to clean up and functional. Just remember the spare rib limitation and you will be fine."
2,Not sure I'd buy this again,"This rib rack may be ok if you're smoking a lot of meat at once and need to create more space on the grill, but the ribs were hard to turn because they would get stuck in the rack. The ribs turned out great, though. In fact, they were the best ribs I've ever had, but that was the first time I've smoked ribs (on myWeber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker/Smoker). I'm going to try laying them flat to see if it makes any difference. If it doesn't, I won't use the rack again."
2,rib rack,"Disappointed that this item was not stainless steel like the roast rack is. Otherwise, it is larger than it looks."
5,Rib Rack Works,Not too much to say here. It's a rib rack that is designed to stand your ribs while cooking as opposed to laying them flat. It works! The ribs stand up! Nuff said...
3,Complimentary,The product is as purchased and delivered in a timely and professional manner.The purchase met all my expectations and am pleased
4,Works great for spare ribs,"I have used this twice now. Once for baby back ribs (pork loin back) and once for St. Louis style trimmed spare ribs. It worked great both times, but was easier with the spare ribs than the baby backs. This was because the spare ribs were straighter (less curve to the rib bones) than the baby backs and stood upright better. The curve in the baby back ribs made it slightly more difficult to remove a single rack of ribs to rotate it. But this was a minor issue. Overall the unit worked great."
1,no meat,20 second tips with awful repeating music in between without even hitting the ball. He only hits 3 balls during this whole DVD.
5,Excellent,"The International Contemporary Ensemble is one of the most talented group of young musicians I've encountered. The caliber of the performance on this disk is tantalizing! New music is always the victim of shabby productions, but not when in the hands of this group. Huang Ruo, an excellent young composer in his own right, should be honored that his music has been rendered with such care. I'm sure the Ensemble Intercontemporain would be proud!"
2,sticks everytime,"I bought this pan directly from Chantal and I have had it over a year now and it sticks EVERYTIME no matter what I use. I bought it for omelettes b/c I use stainless for everything else and thought it would be nice to have a nonstick pan that wasn't teflon and that supposedly didn't require me to use oil or butter for nonstick purposes. Now, when I make omelettes I always use a bit of butter for flavor but unless the pan is coated including the sides, whatever touches it will stick, and even then it's not guaranteed. Chantal makes good products (and they are cheaper than Le Creuset) but know that this is not nonstick."
3,metal scratches,"I know we aren't supposed to use metal utensils in this pot but I forgot and scrambled some eggs with a fork. Now there are lots of ugly gray scratches. As far as I know, they won't come off . . . ever. Will they?"
2,Tool holder,I still use it because I haven't found anything better. It doesn't stay attached to my grill very well. I have a smaller Weber grill. Since this is not bent to the shape of the grill it tends to fall off - along with the tools I have hanging on it.
2,Bad Design,The kid that designed this may have an Engineering degree but he obviously has never come within 2 feet of a Charcoal Grill. This rack sets all of your tools about 3 inches from the blazing hot coals that are cooking your food making your tools entirely to hot to handle. It also is gravity connected to your grill so it easily comes off when being moved and also gets in the way of the cover.Save your Money.
5,handy,I got it so that I could add 5 cents + to my order to get free shipping. I found out that it is actually quite handy to have next to the grill and I really use it. And it's cheap!
3,Handy with OK Quality,This is a handy gadget if you own a Kettle without a table. The clips are a little light and wimpy for my liking.
3,Not a great design,"The holder gets in the way of the lid's lip when you try to put the lid back on - as a result the lid no longer slips into place with this holder attached. Also, the holder doesn't clip onto the kettle's edge too snugly (when you do finally get the lid pushed into place) so the holder can easily become dislodged by picking up the lid. Otherwise, it does what it's supposed to do.(It's obvious the original engineers who created the grill didn't have this accessory in mind in the final design!)"
5,Really a handy little gadget!,"Clips right onto the rim of the lower kettle half, well-made, really handy, you NEED one of these! Possibly TWO of these!!!"
1,Don't bother,"The idea here is nice - a little rack to hang your tongs and stuff on. However, the execution is bad, and it's just as easy to put tongs and things on the ground near the smoker.Problems:1. It's very hard to make the lid sit tightly with this in place. That results in loss of smoke and heat.2. The rack doesn't stay on well. So when I pulled my tongs off, the whole rack came with them.3. Storing tools that close to a hot surface is prone to singed fingers.I plan on getting a little table to keep near my smoker, to hold tools, spare wood chips, thermometers, etc. That'll be more useful than this holder."
4,"Shoot Em Up Pork Grinds!,","Each time I cook with my grille, I use this around my waist and have all my utensils handy and ready to go, what I did was just hang it upon my belt and it works great, unless you use suspenders or don't wear pants."
2,Weber product can't take the heat,"Nice, neat place to hang my tools while cooking in my Weber kettle, but after about 6 months, the hooks holding the tools had bent down from the hook shape to an L shape from the heat. Weber, you should use more heat resistant metal for a piece of equipment meant to hang on the side of a grill."
3,"Nice idea, flawed execution",This tool hanger tends to fall off the side of the kettle with the slightest bump and also prevents the lid from sealing tightly.
3,"No use for my Weber 767001 One-Touch Platinum 22-1/2""","In description there is nothing says about not compatable with Weber 767001 One-Touch Platinum 22-1/2"" Charcoal Grill, I cant use it with my new grill - no place to put it."
1,REPRODUCTION HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT,"Being familiar with the originals (at Circus World Museum in Baraboo, WI. It was with a profound dissapointment to see a badly reproduced assortment of posters. Not even worthy of displaying.-Giovanni Iuliani CHS (member of the Circus Historical Society)"
3,A couple of good ones,"A little boring, but ""The Road Virus Heads North"" is a great one. I can't remember all of the titles, but one of my other favorites is the one where a guy gets bitten by a snake and it sends his body into toxic shock and his heart stops beating. He is taken into the autopsy room ALIVE and tries everything to get the mortician to realize he is not dead. The ending is a shocker!"
3,nightscape little tales,well the little stories were really entertaining and i liked the movie but i was diappointent ti had to end due to i only had some of the tale was missing a whole number dvd i believe either that or there is another dvd full of episode cause it shows previews of tales that we dont get to watch in all though it was a good movie ejoyed what i did see
4,"An Old ""Friend"" bwahaha","Anyone who was ever afraid to put their feet on the floor due to watching Trilogy of Terror with Karen Black ( old movie but worth seeing even now , trust me on this one, you will never be the same again!) will recognize an old friend on the top shelf in the first movie titled Battleground. When he gets to his apartment, don't look away ! This was worth the entire movie to me. Always nice to see an old um friend...LOL"
4,Nightmares and Dreamscapes,"For the Stephen King fans to be sure, a wonderful collection of short stories captured on film"
4,nightmares and dreamscapes,if your a true king fan you will want to watch this.i really liked it.it makes a great addition to your king collection.highly recommend!
4,More good stories by the master.,This DVD was very good and did not leave me disappointed. The stories seemed to follow along really well. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Stephen King.
3,yum,Very nice DVD! great episodes and a nice slim case design. The episodes are stylishly wonderful too
3,Could have been a better King show,"I already saw this set before I purchased it. But it's for my brother in law who is a Stephen King fan like myself. Even though the short stories on them arent very good, or good at all really, simply because it is a Stephen King item, it has to go into both of our collections. If you are simply thinking of purchasing this because you can't find it anywhere and you think it might be good because it is a Stephen King, then get Kingdom Hospital. This DVD set isn't good for entertainment, just good for filling a spot on a Stephen King collecters shelf."
1,"Just plain awful, tedious, dumb and poorly acted","There are 2 somewhat OK episodes, Battleground and The End Of The Whole Mess but they don't compensate for the drivel factor of the rest. I don't get it - why do they bother? Even the good actors are stiff as a board, no doubt frozen by the terrible scripts and low budget effects."
2,Dissapointing,I watched a couple of these on TV and could not get into any of them.I like kings novels but not these shows.
4,"Easy assembly, but it does require some drilling/screwing into the ceiling","So far I really like this. The assembly was simple, and it wasn't too difficult to do alone, although an additional person would have been useful at times.Perhaps I didn't read carefully enough, but I was under the impression that this would not require any drilling or screws. This is my preference as I want it to be semi-portable. In addition, I live in an apartment and would like to minimize drilling. In any case, this does require two screws to attach it to the ceiling. This was a particular problem for me because my ceiling is not easily drilled into. At the moment I have it secured with heavy duty adhesive strips and tension. It seems to be doing ok at the moment.Beyond this somewhat minor issue, this is an excellent, sturdy, visually appealing, and practical bike storage device."
5,Fast delivery.,I was surprised by how quickly my chimney starter arrived. I was also surprised by how bug it is! It works great.
5,Works great!,Ive had it for about 6 months and i cant complain one bit!!! it works way better than my first one i bought from walmart (non weber) this one lights much better.... i used to have to use a little lighterfluid on my old one this one absolutly none! GREAT JOB WEBER!!!
5,You Could Fire Up Your Grill With Something Else...,"...but why??? Dump your charcoal (lump charcoal is my favorite!) into the top, the crumple up some newspaper underneath and light the paper. Twenty minutes later, you have enough glowing coals to cook dinner for your family. Here are a few tips:- Sprinkle a little vegetable oil on the newspaper to keep it burning longer;- Use lump charcoal - it doesn't have all of the additives of charcoal;- Do not expect to be able to cook for a large party - you will need a 2nd chimney full of coals."
5,Don't use newspaper!,"Do yourself a favor and buy a box of ""StarterLogg"", wood fire starters at Home depot. These are meant to start wood fires in fire places and are made of sawdust and parrafin. Cut off two chunks from the Staterlogg, light them, and place the charcoal chimney with the charcoal inside over the burning chunks. This will get your charcoal started three times faster than with newspaper, and you won't have the burned up newspaper ash blowing around your back yard. I don't know why Weber and Kingsford doesn't team up with the StarterLogg people, and advertise this approach. Hey Weber! I am available to help advertise your product!"
5,You don't have one yet?,"I've used one for over 5 years now, and will never be without one again. I've seen cheaper (and smaller... Ok, OK -- I bought one!) imitations sold elsewhere, but they aren't as well made and don't last.This is required equipment for a charcoal grill. They should include one with every grill sold."
5,Weber 87886 Chimney Starter,"This chimney starter works great. You just put 2 pieces of paper in the bottom, light, and 10 minutes later you are ready to grill!"
5,Great Product - Major Paradigm shift,"I simply can't believe how well this thing works!As many other reviewers have stated it gets the coals ready in 10-15 minutes (perfectly ready for grilling) without the need for expensive and smelly starter fluid.I honestly believe I will never again use starter fluid, this product has really opened my eyes to a concept I didn't believe possible.A very worthy purchase!"
5,I Hate(d) BBQ,"My memories of BBQ were of something that tasted of lighter fluid and bbq sauce. Now that I use a BBQ chimney (thanks Alton Brown), I enjoy and look forward to grilling and smoking. This chimney has made a huge change in how I view BBQ."
4,good purchase,i was sent what i asked for. it's a great size for medium to large grills. in great condition and shipped really fast. satisfied customer.
5,love the chimney starter,"this chimney starter/charcoal starter is great. all I do is roll up 2 pieces of newspaper on the bottom, load the briquets on top and light the newspaper and I've got hot coals in 10 to 20 mins. no need to worry about lighting or relighting with lighter fluid, in fact I'm never going to use lighter fluid again and I won't taste it in my food!!"
4,Weber chimney sarrter,Best starter I've ever had. Works every time. Quality constuction and good size capacity.
5,Cool product!,"Well worth the eleven bucks I paid for it. All you do is stuff two sheets of newspaper in the bottom from the bottom, fill the starter with charcoal, light the newspaper, and watch it smoke. And it smokes quite a bit in the beginning. In about 15-20 minutes the smoke diminishes and the coals are white hot and ready to go. It's that simple. The starter is a must for anyone who doesn't want to use lighter fluid."
4,Superior Chimney Starter,"Other than that little metal piece overlapping the handle, this is a great chimney. That piece is for your second hand to stabilize the thing while you are pouring the coals out. It gets in the way more than it helps though. This chimney is slightly wider than others I have used and has the air holes up and down the sides. These air holes get the fire going quickly. I think every fire I have started with this thing has only taken one match unlike my experiences with other chimneys that have taken 2 or 3 rounds of lightings to get it going."
5,"Small investment, big payoff",Buy this product! It makes coal starting/grilling so much easier. This product will pay for itself very quickly (you won't have to buy lighter fluid or the more expensive self-lighting charcoal anymore).
5,Just lite it...and watch it perform!!,"If there ever was a product that performed as advertised...this has to be it! I could'nt believe my eyes...i loaded the charcoal in the Bin...stuffed two sheets of newspapers in the bottom...lit it...""PRESTO""....20 minutes later it was Ready. I was flat out Amazed! After retiring my Gas Grill after 10 yrs...i wanted to go back to Charcoal...so i purchased a ""Weber 1 Touch Silver""...and while i was at it i... decided to get the ""Weber Chimney Starter"". The Best Purchases i have made in a long time....better yet Guys...your wife does'nt have to bug you about reading directions...Load the top...Lite the bottom...How much easier can it get!"
4,Smokin',"This is great when you are short on time, the only issue is that the coals on the bottom burn much faster than those on the top...if you do not hit it right you miss the best heat....."
5,Weber Chimney Starter - a great buy,This works better than lighter fluid. The coals are ready sooner and are more evenly lit. It is definitely worth the money.
2,Too hot to handle,"I've had numerous chimney starters over the years and they are all pretty much the same, except for this one. Webber for some reason put a plastic handle on it that gets waaaayyyyyy too hot to touch. In the past, they have always had wooden handles, and picking them up to dump them out was not a problem. Now I have to keep a pair of gloves by the grill just for this one issue. Otherwise it's a quality item, that seems to be holding up nicely. I gave it 2 stars just because I think its a pretty serious design flaw, with a very simple solution."
5,fantastic,I read some great reviews about this thing and thought I'd try it. It completely lives up to its great reputation. Absolute necessity for charcoal grilling. Gets all of the coals a uniform cherry red within about 10 minutes. I was waiting 30 minutes for a heap of starter-fluid soaked coals to get burning half as well.
5,Coal Ahoy,If you want the correct way to start a charcoal BBQ this is it.No fumes. No lousy after taste. Just great BBQ.
5,"Top of the line, practically starts the fire by itself","I have used other chimney starters, and in fact have even written favorable reviews for another model on this site. Well that was before I broke down and bought the Weber model.I love this chimney starter, it really is better than the others.- charcoal capacity seems greater than other brands- The coals get going an glowing faster than with the other model- Fire has not yet ""gone out"" (sometimes with other brands I have had to put in more newspaper and start over, or relight the newspaper.)- the extra handle that swings up to make it more stable when you are dumping the hot coals is a nice feature.All in all I wish I had gotten this model of the starter much sooner, it would have saved me a few headaches. Add in the fact that it is actually cheaper (at least on amazon.com) than the other brand of chimney starter, and I think you have to admit it is a win-win."
5,chimney charcoal starter,Works MUCH better than using lighter fluid. Holds plenty of charcoal and design allows it to light in no time. We have been using this product since it came out a couple years ago. We wouldn't use anything else!!!
5,no more lighter fluid,"For people like me that like to barbecue, the chimney starter isa fantastic idea. Not only do you not have to buy lighter fluidand the associated odor that comes with it, the coals are ignited much faster. I would highly recommend this product"
5,Backyard Chef's Dream,Chimney starter is larger and stronger than others I've used. Handle is superb! Great product - worth the price difference compared to discount store chimney!
5,Weber 7416,This charcoal starter works perfectly every time. Would highly recommend to any charcoal cooking enthusiast!
5,Chimney Starter Works Great!!!,What I can tell you is that this product works and it works great. Simply pour your charcole into the product and place a couple of crumpled pieces of news paper and light. You get red hot charcole in 20 minutes.I highly suggest it!!!
5,Charcoal is ready in no time!,"This is a great product. I had some doubts at first but they were soon put to rest. No more lighting fluid! Just two sheets of newspaper does the trick. The Weber chimney starter is sturdy, well made, and a great value. I was impressed with how fast the charcoal was ready!"
2,COULD BE HAZARDOUS!,"YES, THIS ITEM DOES HEAT YOUR CHARCOAL FASTER, BUT IT SEEMS PRETTY DANGEROUS, TOO. I GUESS I ADDED TOO MUCH NEWSPAPER (4 SHEETS) BECAUSE THE ENTIRE PILE OF CHARCOAL WAS ONE HUGE FLAME AND IT WAS BURNING THE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTAINER, I COULD SEE SCORCHING. I HAD TO ADD WATER TO DOUSE THE FLAME! THEN, WHEN I POURED THE CHARCOAL INTO THE BBQ, RED-HOT ASHES WERE FLYING EVERYWHERE. I FOUND THAT PRETTY SCARY. THINK I'LL STICK WITH THE OLD FASHIONED WAY TO LIGHT CHARCOAL. BETTER SAFE (AND A LITTLE MORE TIME) THAN SORRY! I LIVE IN SO. CALIF., WHERE EVERYTHING IS BONE DRY AND APT TO CATCH FIRE, THE ASHES MAY NOT BE SUCH A THREAT IN WETTER CLIMATES."
5,Can't be a barBquer W/O this,"Forget the lighter fluid! With the Chimney Starter, all you need is a couple of pages from the New York Times. a match, and some charcol. I have used this many times without fail. I am a serious dutchovencampcooker and the list of stuff I bring camping, exceeds the maximum limit on trailer weight, but this is one thing that I would not take off my list if the cops pulled me over."
3,Save shipping charges and buy from home depot,"I bought this product because Cooks Illustrated gave it high ratings. So i was on a mission to find the exact model, 87886, that was tested and given a ""highly recommend."" i went to home depot and they didnt have the exact model number so when i found it on amazon i bought it right away. when i got it, it was the same product that i saw at The Home Depot. The only difference was the model numbers other than that, the same exact product. I was upset because i paid the high shipping cost for this item. So i paid over $22 on Amazon when i could have paid $14.99+tax at my local Home Depot."
5,Weber Chimney Starter,"This chimney is great! I have used a different brand before and liked them, but so far the Weber brand is holding up great. I love not having to use the starter fluid to start my charcoal. I love the heat shield and the handle does not get too hot. It easy to handle. I even ordered another one for a good friend of mine and He loves it too.It holds just enough charcoal to cook a nice dinner for my family."
4,A-,"I bought this for my new 50/50 grill and I do really like it. It works great, and has the extra handle that the one at my local stores didnt have."
5,Best doo hickey ever.,"No lighter fluid, no aftertaste on the food. Easy as 1-2-3. !0 Fill the top with charcoal. 2) Add 2 sheets of newspaper to the bottom; and 3) light the newsparer. Let it sit for 20 minutes and you have coals ready to cook. Ingenius and inexpensive."
2,Great Product - Bad Handle,"Chimney Starters are definitely the way to go, easy starting, contained flame, no flammable liquids, etc. While this chimney starter has a larger volume than most (a plus) combining that with a plastic handle makes for a tricky situation. All that heat melted the handle of mine. The heat also ignited some charcoal, from a previous grilling session, that was surrounding the starter rather than in it and had my Kitchen mitt, which was hanging off the side of the grill, smoldering.I suggest trying a chimney starter with a wooden handle which will work just as well and cost less"
4,weber chimney starter,I have owned one for a long time and kept it outside or in the shed.The one i owned was not a weber and it took over 30 minutes to be ready and it took repeated sheets of newspaper to become ready.So i took the plunge to buy the weber model and i am not dissapointed at all. This starter only took the 15 minutes as advertised with 2 sheets of paper.The only dissapointing thing to me was being made in Taiwan.
5,Easy to use and no yucky lighter fluid,"I bought this because I have kids and don't care to invite the kind of accidents that lighter fluid seems to invite. I also read about a family that poisoned themselves because they cooked their meat without letting the ligther fluid burn off completely. Yeesh. This is safer, less toxic, and cheaper in the long run than lighter fluid. It's never been more difficult than just filling with charcoal, crunching up 2 pieces of newspaper and lighting the bottom. When the charcoal is ready, you pour it into your grill. Works like a charm. There are other chimneys out there, but this Weber is a good sturdy one."
5,excellent,The chimney starter works very well. Just one thing to be aware of. Use only two sheets of newspaper as suggested. If you stuff the chamber too full you will not get a good flame and the charcoal will not start. Be stingy with the paper and it works great.
5,Flame On!,Used this in conjunction with my WSM... you can load a chimney full of charcoal and have it RED HOT inside 15 minutes without the use of lighter fluid! Great for BBQs!
5,love it!,"ORDER IT,GOT HERE QUICK,IT LOOK JUST LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD.IT BIG,NOT LIKE THE ONES AT YOUR GROCERY STORE FOR 7 BUCKS,GOOD QUALITY,HUGE!HIGH QUALITY.VERY PLEASE!!!"
5,King of Chimney Starters,Fantastic...worth every cent. I used to be the guy that used a ton of gunk (starter fluid) on his charcoal....bad bad bad; now I get my flames started easily and reliably with this little beauty. I'm ordering a 2nd one for the other side of my grill.
5,Gets things going fast!,This is the first time I have used a chimey starter for charcoal - very handy little thing. Gets it going much faster and with less mess than mounding the coals up around fire starter. This one will also do enough charcoal to fill the bottom of my Weber Kettle...some other chimneys I have seen are really small and the construction is flimsey - not this one. Feels very sturdy!! I will never be without one again!
4,No more lighter fluid,This is one of those too simple gadgets that works great. I use lump charcoal so sometimes I have to light it twice but you get hot coals in about 11 minutes and the handle stays cool.
5,Outstanding...,"I wish I had bought this item earlier. I bought the 18 1/2"" grill a few months ago, and after struggling with starting it with charcoal (briquettes are just too expensive in Pakistan), I was disappointed that I could not use it more often.I saw the starter on Amazon, read the reviews, thought it a good idea, won approval from the Home Department [read wife], and bought it. In the past 2 months, since I've had it, I have used it about seven (7) times. It is that easy to use - even with just plain charcoal.Highly recommended!!!"
4,Weber 87886 chimney starter,"This product hastens and simplifies the grill charcoal starter process.However, I would like the product better for my 22 inch grill if it were two inches shorter, which would still provide enough charcoal content and would make it safer to dump the hot charcoals onto the grill. With the length given, one must be careful that no live charcoal falls outside of the grill."
3,"starts coals well, but very very smoky","I've had one of these for several years. It does, indeed, start coals quickly and efficiently. There is a downside, however. While the paper is catching fire, a great deal of smoke is generated. Definitely stay away from colored newspaper inks. They're the worst. It's marginally better than stinking up the yard/neighborhood with lighter fluid fumes, but be warned that you need to close the windows on the side of the house closest to the starter, unless you want to enjoy that nice newspaper-burning smell indoors for a few days!"
4,"Great coal-starter, but not for your chimney","This looked like a great chimney starter, but when I put it on the ground next to where I wanted my new chimney, it just sat there and didn't do anything. I even tried putting a few bricks on the ground next to it to sort of give it a hint, but that didn't work, either. It acts like its never even heard of a chimney. Someone should complain to Ralph Nader about this. On the other hand, it works great for starting coals, which I don't use in my fireplace or chimney anyway. So why this isn't called a coal-starter I don't know. But one thing's for sure, it definitely isn't a chimney starter."
3,Father of 3 small children,Chimney starter works well but was disappointed to find out it did not have a lever that dropped the coals. You have to dump them when they are ready. The sale price is much closer to its value. I would not pay full retail for it again.
1,Very well made.,"This unit is of heavy gauge construction even for a starter. The price was competitive...too, delivery was prompt and courteous."
2,requested review,"The item was not packed well and arrived dented. Subsequent to unpacking, I saw a similar item (different brand) in a retail store for about half the price. The item has not been used yet."
2,"too expensive, after I ordered I found one that was half the cost.",the product is find but it ended up being expensive. I found the same thing in a store for half the price.
2,Poor return policy,"The product was as discribed, but since I received more than one, it had to be returned. The vendor charged a restocking fee. This is not what I have come to expect from Amazon.com vendors. I will not buy from this vendor again."
3,CDM-150,"I have the CDM-150 and I play a small bar once a week that holds about 200 people and I have had no problem with this system. I am able to beat match, blend and loop effortlessly. NOT A SYSTEM FOR SCRATCHING!!!! If this is what you are looking for try another brand but if you want to just do basic DJ'ing it will work out find. I have it hooked up to a Peavey PR15 and barely have the speaker past 2 and its rocks the whole bar. Great for price!"
4,Hamlet with the Prince,"This is of course a very well known book, which set a new standard for textual criticism of Shakespeare's plays. It performs the remarkable feat of casting a completely new light on the most familiar and apparently best known of the plays, and although one does not necessarily agree with all his interpretations one is immensely stimulated by the author's brilliance in extracting new meanings from familiar lines. Strongly recommended to any one with the least interest in Shakespeare the dramatist."
2,Defective disc,"This is a 2-disk set. While I love the show and enjoy the episodes, disc 1 is defective. After the first two sets of shows, it hangs in the middle of episodes. I have tried to find a way to report this and have it replaced, but have been unable. Bottom line...show--fun! Disc--defective."
3,George of the bungle,"Nice non-stop collection of retro saturday morning cartoons featuring that bungler of mass muscle in the swinging trees, George of the jungle. Although George is the self acclaimed ""king of the jungle"", he is outwitted not by his jungle villains, but by his co-stars Super Chicken and Tom Slick who nearly deliver in cleverness and pure cartoon fun. George is fun, but sometimes his clueless way of living can become alarming, even when he recalls his live in mate ""a long haired guy who doesn't shave."" Makes you wonder why he doesn't learn from his many mistakes to improve his performance in hero saving when his buddies Super Chicken and even Tom Slick relish the playful antics and adjust to their styles with vigor. Gee, all that muscle pumping, but not in his brain."
1,"No captions or subtitles... Thanks a lot, Classic Media.","Oh, surprise, surprise. Again Classic Media has disenfranchised deaf and hard-of-hearing people; they haven't bothered to caption or subtitle this series."
5,Re: George of the Jungle,I used to watch this with my two sons. Sent this to my twin grandsons as a birthday gift.
4,"Great DVD, fast shipping!!!","I ordered the George of the Jungle series and it was everything I remembered. That coupled with Super Chicken and Tom Slick took me back to when I was 6 watching these cartoons on after Popeye on KTLA 5 on Sundays. I highly recommend this to show kids vs some of the lame crack influenced cartoons that are on these days. The shipping was fast too, but it usually is when ever I order from Amazon."
5,Not a review but a question Please!!,"In the opening theme, there ia a tin lizzy that is jumping over a shack. (Obviously it will drop to the ground even though the drop isn't shown). Does any body out there know what that clip was taken from? I'd like to get the whole thing, which is certainly a silent movie. Thanks all."
2,Not the Classic Many May Expect,"This is not the classic one would expect from the makers of ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"". I had only slim recollection of this one, from my childhood (I remembered the theme song more than anything else), so I took a chance, assuming, like 'Jonny Quest', 'The Jetsons', and 'Top Cat' that this one would hold up, as well. It does not. The humor is more than droll. Don't waste your time - or money. Go for something better, like ""The Pink Panther"". When reviewing a number of late 60s Saturday morning cartoons, that's the only one that really stands out."
3,George of the Jungle,"The cartoon was good for that time period and it was funny, it brought back memories of when I used to watch when I was a kid."
5,FUN TO SEE AGAIN!,"The TV room in our fraternity house at college was always packed eachSaturday morning during that 30 minutes when GEORGE OF THE JUNGLEwas on. We loved it!I am enjoying seeing these episodes again today as much as I enjoyedseeing them back then. What great fun!Though the dialogue is full of puns and subtle references to topics inworld literature, history, culture, etc., which are ""over the heads"" ofchildren, they certainly enjoy the subject matter and the format. Ittruly is entertaining.I highly recommend this set to anyone with any semblance of a""funny bone"" (that's a ""sense of humor"", for those without one).With the way the world seems to be going these days, we all couldenjoy a good laugh now and then. This set provides plenty!"
4,Fun from the past!,"I used to watch these as a kid, and they're still fun! One of Jay Ward's less-celebrated series, it still has the trademark dedication to fun that makes all the Ward animations so good to watch.That said, the show was never as intelligent as Rocky and Bullwinkle, and there are so few episodes that none of the characters ever gets developed like Dudley Do-Right.Still, if you're a Jay Ward fan, go for it! Just the theme song will make you a kid again!"
3,This is an excellent rendition by a brass band.,"If you are a brass band fan, you'll like this recording. The band does a very precise rendition of Mozart's delightful music from the Magic Flute."
2,US-Games Wooden Ring Toss,"The base unit of the ring toss did not hold up to endurance standards.For the money, the producer should recreate the design. In other words, too much money, for too little product."
4,NFL Films - Colts - The Complete History,"I have three football-fanatic sons who really enjoyed the history of the Baltimore Colts on Disc 1. I couldn't find Disc 2, but I have a suspicion the squirrels in my back yard are using it as a hoola-hoop."
5,Colts discs,"I'm gonna buy this and use disc ONE as a reflector for my own bike!! And watch disc 2 fiftenn times!! Congrats 2007 INDIANAPOLIS Colts, World Champs!!"
1,Finally broke down and bought this title.............,"It will not be too much trouble using white-out to get rid of the ""Indianapolis"" stains on the cover. And, like some other reviewers have pointed out, the second disk will be great for cleaning up my bird-cage, for sliding under my tottering table leg and for whizzing across the room is I root for it to smash into a million pieces. GO RAVENS!!!!!!"
5,"Great DVD, shame on Baltimore reviewer","The DVD's are a great history of a great franchise, very enjoyable history of two eras. You might notice the multiple jokes about disc 2 most of which are obviously written by the same sad and unfulfilled hater. Please go away and spread your hatred elsewhere. Real fans of football do not need your garbage."
4,Relive the joy of being a Baltimore Colts fan,"It doesn't seem that long ago that my friends would gather to watch the Baltimore Colts play. You could really feel the love back then, and you can relive it while watching Disc 1 of this set.I found that Disc 2 works well as an ice scraper, especially on my side mirrors. But you have to break it first."
4,some interesting things!,"Albright's musics are based on atonal method. In this CD, 'Five Chromatic Dances', 'Pianoagogo', 'Sphaera' are atonal music. So, if you are not acquainted with modern atonal music, you will hate these musics. But albright's 'Grand Sonata in Rag'is diffrent from any other musics in this CD. This music is very cute, interesting! Grand Sonata in Rag is tonal and Ameraican jazz Style. You will love it! In the view points of pianist, this sonata kills all pianists. This music requires very heavy technics. But, I'm sure that this sonanta give you-listener happyness and fun."
3,Nice Watch,The watch looked very nice however one of the links had two discolorations. They looked like 2 black lines. Macy's was very good about returning it. They didnt have any at available atmacys.
1,An Unfortunate Read,"I was forced to read this book, not out of personal interest, but for the purpose of a graduate seminar on Canadian identity. In his prose (if you would like to call it that), Bhabha offers no conclusion, no criticism of other theory, no theory at all for that matter, and no agency. It is poetry- which is great if you like poetry- but not so great if you are expecting to learn anything at all about nationalism or identity. He is well known for being incomprehensible for a good reason and unless you have the time to read and re-read then I also have to agree that you choose another author. Best of luck either way."
2,Smart man needs to learn to write,"Homi Bhabha is undoubtedly a smart man, with much to offer to the field of postcolonialism. If you read this book with no real timeline (or, rather, if you can re-read and re-read it), you will get a lot from it. BUT the man needs a composition course or two. He is very much of the school of 'if I have a great idea, I must make it look inaccessible for people to think it so' and in the process renders his book rather useless. A great pity, but all in all, you should just read him if your university course requires you to. Otherwise, read his fans, those who can summarize him in plain English"
1,Bad design,"This thing kept falling over while on the grill. It would get caught on the grill and since it's hot you can't easily move it. It's been discarded, rusting under the deck."
2,Read If You Want to be Depressed,This is a very depressing book. I would not recommend it to anyone. I'm not sure why it was recommended to me.
1,Weak,"After a month of use this cover is already ripping in a couple of places. Great grill, lousy cover."
2,They don't make 'em like they used to.,"I bought the original Premium 9954 grill cover for my Platinum II 3400 grill in 1998. It fit the grill exactly and had a heavy rubber coating and lasted 9 years. They quit making it so bought the 7555 which was the only one big enough to fit it. It was cheap vinyl and only lasted 3 years. I now bought the new cheapened up still called Premium 9954 that they are making. It doesn't fit as good as the original, is vinyl with a cloth backing, and looks like it will last 3-4 years. What happened to quality and customer satisfaction? Make it cheap overseas and make a huge profit."
5,non-stop action,"If you enjoyed the action in Silverwing you will not be able to put this one down. It picks up right where book one left off and is all action from the get-go. The whole story line gets a litte more crazy and hard to believe in this book and I didn't feel like I learned as much about bats (maybe because I had already read the first one) but I loved the book and stayed up late to get it finished.BTW, I am not afraid to admit that I am an adult, and not a ""young-adult"" anymore, both of these books are great and I recommend them to my adult friends as well as students. :)"
3,"A very good read, but a bit intense for kids, IMO","I read this book right after Silverwing, and while the plot is very well put together and paced, and I read it almost non-stop, I do think that it is too intense for kids. My son loved Silverwing, although he said that ""it went up and down a lot"", but I think this will be too much for him to read on his own. The live sacrifices and cruelty to living creatures by humans and other animals are quite rough going for the 9 - 12 crowd that this book is aimed at."
5,The founding father of American Modern Design,"George Nelson was not only a creative artistic talent, he was also a commercial genius (just like Picasso was). These two talents provided his secret for success that would reward him throughout his life. This book is an actual reprint from the original edition. It documents in detail how George Nelson thought and designed. The attention is clearly on his biography, this is not a coffee table book filled with an overdose of pictures. A wonderful biography about a designer that was the founding father of American Modern Design. I also suggest to visit the wonderful online archive about George Nelson at WWW.GEORGENELSON.ORG."
2,Overrated,"I was expecting some great insights from a design visionary. However, after a few initial essays (which were forgettable) the famed author proceeds to go through a slide-show of his photo collection, matching by common traits. Even THAT would be acceptable if coupled with a designer's perspective on ""how to see"" those images in such a way that it leads to some greater insight about design or aesthetics. No ... sometimes the observations are quite pedantic."
5,I listen to this one alot!,At least twice a week lately in fact :-) I find myself fascinated with music of this era and I am very glad I got this album. If you like early music please give the clips a listen and I think you will agree this album is worth buying!The liner notes contain the lyrics in both the language sung and an english translation. This is handy for folks like me who only know english and want to know exactly what is being sung :-)
2,"good effort, but...","...this is hardly one of the best CDs out there. Those who think so have obviously not listened widely enough. I suppose its popularity stems from its title, which gives it away as an easy introduction to the period. Multiple preferable CDs exist for each of the areas it surveys: medieval dance (Istanpitta I and II), Cantigas de Santa Maria (multiple releases under that title), Llibre Vermell (the Sarband release; The Black Madonna), Minnesang (Wanderers' Voices), and trouvere/troubadour repertoire (too many). The bottom line: nice intro, but unnecessary if you want to do more than graze the surface of available talent."
2,"Good Performances, Bad Becording","This was my first introduction to music of the Middle Ages -- I purchased it to broaden my musical experience. The musicians and singers provide fine performances. However, the sound recording is very poor -- an occaisional pop is heard, as though it was recorded from an LP. Also, the signal level is too low (especially for a supposedly DDD recording). Increasing the volume makes the background noise annoyingly noticable along with a rumbling sound (as though from a turntable). Since, as another reviewer has observed, there are better collections available, I do not recommend purchasing this recording."
4,good product,This worked quite well. My dad (90) found it very easy to use. Only drawback - difficult to use on one's lap - better at a table or desk.
2,It works but not the greatest,"I bought the skewers because the price was reasonable and that it was from Weber. Unfortunately, the quality isn't what Weber used to be - dependable and long lasting. Although it claims that it's dishwasher safe, the skewers came out rusted and discolored. I suggest hand washing them. Look at other choices before buying this one."
3,Three Complaints,"These skewers do a good job of preventing food from rotating while on the grill; however, I have three complaints.1) Flimsy. I was expecting them to be sturdier. Each prong wiggled a bit too much for my taste. It made the food a little bit harder to put on the skewer. I guess the trade-off is that Weber wanted the skewer to be lightweight. I think Weber should have made them a little heavier to make them a bit sturdier.2) Rust. Make sure you handwash them. Not a huge amount of rust happens after putting them in the dishwasher---- but the rust is annoying.3) Dull ends. There are no points at the end of the skewer. Pointy ends would make it easier to put the food on.Food doesn't spin, and they're lightweight. I give them 3 stars."
2,Rusting and Dull,The 2 prong skewer is great but these started to rust before the first use. The ends are blunt and tear shrimp and other thin meats. Somewhat disappointing for a Weber product to be so cheaply produced and so well presented for sale!
2,Limited Use,"We have several different types of skewers. These are a pain to load because you have to push the delicious cargo on with accurate separation between the tips or the whole thing starts to warp as you add more cargo. Also, meat is difficult to push on which makes maintaining separation even more difficult.The only ones we use out of our pile of skewers are the single flat/wide skewers with nice pointed tips, or wooden ones when cleanup is to be avoided.You can make any type of skewer work, but having used so many different types I can say with confidence there are much better alternatives."
4,Skewers,"Just what I needed. Keeps the items from spinning around your usual rod.Could be a bit longer, but I just use more."
4,Intuitive Career Advice,"I found this product very useful, helpful and interesting. The production could use a little tune up but I didn't mind since I was just interested in the information and advice that the dvd offers. As a business owner I was curious to see how to more efficiently evaluate incoming talent. If applicants take the steps that are recommended in this DVD it will certainly put them ahead of the rest of the pack . This could be a useful DVD for jobseekers, especially in this economy."
5,Perfect for your chocolate cravings!,I had just started weight watchers and my friend introduced me to this product. They were so good! They were the perfect combination of soft and chewy. I've served these to family and friends and they really enjoyed them too (they had no idea they were fat free)! Serving them with strawberries is the perfect combination!One tip - just don't put them in the frig to store. They will be come slightly hard - easy fix - put them in the microwave for 5-10 seconds and they'll soften up!
3,"They taste decent, but not at all like real brownies.","I usually buy real brownies, but these intrigued me so I wanted to try them. I could tell they would be too sweet for me after licking the batter spoon and I was put off by all the cocoa dust that flew out when I dumped the package. They were easy to make though and cooked just fine in cupcake liners. They made about 12 cupcakes. I ate maybe 3 with LOTS of milk and then dumped the rest in the trash. It's not that they taste horrible, it's that they taste absolutely nothing like real brownies. They taste like dark chocolate and sugar goo, in my opinion. I can't stomach diet drinks or anything made with beet sugar or fake sugar either, so I'm not surprised that I hated them.I just realized that, to me, they taste very much like Snackwell's devil food cookies. I never liked those, but I know plenty of people that did."
5,Best way to make them,"One package is 12 servings. 2 WW PointsPlus per piece if you are keeping track. Add the batter to a new shiny 12 spot muffin tray, which I spray with non-stick spray first. I usually cook for about 375 degrees for about 30 minutes. These will come out very crispy around all the edges. To prevent me from eating them all in one day, I throw them in a tupperware container in the freezer, and grab one when I need it. Thaws very quickly, or throw in the microwave for about 10 - 15 seconds for a crispy outside and a warm soft inside. Also add low fat whipped cream topping if you want, we keep ours in the freezer, which makes it almost like ice cream. I use non-sweetened generic brand applesauce instead of yogurt, and add a little vanilla extract just as the recipe on the box recommends. I have made it w/o the extract and really no difference."
5,"Moist and delicious, great for Weight Watchers","If you're watching your weight or not, these brownies are very tasty. They're gooey but taste wonderful and so easy to make. Just stir in 1 container of yogurt and mix by hand. If you are a Weight Watcher, they're just 2 points a square."
2,Beware: LOOK AT BEST BEFORE DATE BEFORE USING!,"I love the product, but the stock the Amazon sent me was about 8 months passed the best before date stamped on the box.Make sure that your product is fresh and safe for consumption by verifying the BEST BEFORE DATE!"
1,NOT GLUTEN FREE!!!!!!!,"I find it disturbing that this comes up in the GLUTEN FREE SELECTIONS!!! THIS IS NOT GLUTEN FREE, OR EVEN WHEAT FREE!!"
4,For quick munching..,"I followed the instructions precisely to make a cake instead of the brownies - but it turned out just alright. I noticed the more I kept it out (not in the fridge) the harder it got :(I tried to warm it in the microwave just before consuming, but that did not help either!They were so tasty for being fat free, that I have to try baking it brownie style and see if it works out."
5,No Pudge but Great Flavor,"My family loves these brownies! We were disappointed that they are no longer available at our local stores, so very pleased to find them on Amazon.com. They are about the easiest brownies I've ever baked - all you need is the box of mix and a small container of vanilla fat-free yogurt. We put walnut halves and pieces on top, I've also sometimes folded walnuts into the mix. They come out perfect and don't taste non-fat at all."
1,Not a diet food,Yet another entry for deceitful advertising. 22 grams of sugar PER SERVING...under what twisted guidelines can that be considered No Pudge?
5,Pretty amazing,These are really great. I like them as single serve RAW for that chocolate fix and I just cooked a double batch in a 13x9 pan with FF vanilla yogurt and they turned out amazing. I only cooked them about 30 mins and they were done. They turned out really fudgy. Let them cool completely. It is a little bit of a pain to portion since they are so fudgy they stuck to my SS spatula I was using to cut. They are delicious. You can't go wrong here. My husband thinks they are OK. He likes full fat ghiradellis. Def try them out. I'm curious about the other flavors.
4,No more messed up seats on my boat,"These covers are not the greatest looking, they fit and they work, and they are definitely better than the messed up vinyl in my worn out boat seats... so they get 4 stars... I would get the next start if they had some nicer designs to choose from but... I guess is better than nothing... they're good, they fit... that is all. I use them in a 16' '86 Invader."
3,My husbands,"These are ok, they don't sit good in the seats, not happy with that, but they cover the cracks in the seat."
2,valuable as a window into Australian radicalism only,"I tried hard to read this -- Spencer Brodney (real name Leon Brodzky) was brother-in-law to my great-grandfather (the publisher Peter Siebel). But it is just too painfully conceived to finish. Tedious left-wing propaganda piece. There are a few decent lines in there, but its only enduring value would seem to be as a window into Australian far-left radicalism of the 1920s.Brodney, BTW, ended up working for the NY Times for many years, and was senior editor of its academic quarterly Current History. Lifelong atheist and communist."
1,Priced So High,"I love this movie, but I want to know why in the world is it priced so damn high. 75 to 90 something dollars for a VHS no less. Ridiculous. Not worth it in my opinion!!!1"
2,Read the book and you'll get the same effect,"Did this screenwriter MIND lifting practically every bit of dialogue straight from the book? I read the book a few years before I saw this, and I remembered it--it was almost as though I were seeing the words on screen. I know that people generally prefer when books adapted to the screen are close to their source material, but this is ridiculous. I mean, this is taken right from the book down to the caramel corn and homemade pizza discussion! Besides the unoriginal script, the acting was pretty bad, even for a kids' film. The characters (except for maybe the Aunt Clare character) were badly cast, especially the role of Amy and Louann. Louann was described as a big girl, but here she's skinny. Overall, I would say read the book. Betty Ren Wright can spin a great tale and you don't have to watch the movie to get a great story."
5,Not just for kids,Probably the best kids movies since the Lion King. Definitely not just for kids though. I was surprised that the sequel was just as good as the original. The sequel is definitely not filler like in some box sets.
5,Even adults will love this one...,"As usual, the artists of Toy Story have done a great job in creating Toy Story 2! Kids and adults alike will surely enjoy this animation, not because it's a 'cartoon', because many of the toys will bring back memories and spark up the kid that sometimes gets lost in the adult world. It's quite a lively approach to reuniting the older generation, with something that was long forgotten, with the younger generation to what being a kid was all about. With toys like Woody, Mr. Potato Head, and Etch-a-sketch seen in this animated fashion it's a film nobody can miss!With the integration of actor-voices like Tom Hanks and his humorous style it turns any frown back to a smile. This animation is the perfect gift for any child or adult and a great way to enjoy a film as a family."
4,Two great films in one pack......,"The film that redefined cinematic technology and its sequal make a great set. Despite the second film's excellent reviews, I still enjoy the first better. Though this is a great set to own, it has practically no extra features, NOT EVEN TRAILERS. Sure, the list looks long, but look over it again. It is mainly technical mumbo jumbo. And the so-called ""out takes"" are during the credits of TS2, nothing I haven't seen. Despite all my dissing about disc space being wasted, the two films together are good enough...."
5,About time...,"The toy story series is special. Toy story was not only was it one of the first full length computer animated movies (appealing to computer boffins) but it is also a story that not only children, but adults love as well.When Toy Story 2 arrived on the scene, amongst critical acclaim, adults found the humour more amusing than most children.Also included is the documentry you may have seen screened around the times of the original releases of the movies on TV. Detailing the history of Pixar and how the company came to life (Don't forget the jumping desk lamp!) and the making of the films.On a technical note: This version contains an anamorphic widescreen and 3:4 ratio tracks, givinga crystal clear picture on the biggest TV. Just as was given with ""A Bugs Life"".A must for any collection."
5,don't buy this and hate yourself!!! what are you thinking!!!,"these are two of the best movies ever made. you owe it to yourself to own this. and both movies in one 3 disk package with tons of extras.....what could possibly be better. if i could give these movies more than five stars, i would. i feel that the two best things that ever happened to disney are tim burton and pixar animation. and guess what folks, this is proof!!! if you missed these movies, be sure and catch them digitally and hopefully in THX. thanks again amazon."
3,Toy Story 1&2,"the package arrived in a timely manner, but the cover was not in as good a shape as described in the for sale section on Amazon. Otherwise the movies seem to be in pretty good shape"
3,Great Kids Movie but don't buy used.,The kids love this movie since we've rented them both before but I bought a used copy and they were both scratched and didn't play all the way through without freezing.I'll never buy from Amazon again.
5,Jewel in the crown of the Disney franchise...,"The Toy Stroy movies are not just for kids. Don't get me wrong, kids will absolutely love them. But these are movies that adults will be equally enthralled watching.The animation is 100% faultless. The attention to details is exquisite. And hats off to Disney for bundling these 2 movies together in a wonderful DVD box set which contains Hilarious deleted scenes.Deserved of all the acclaim both of these movies have recieved."
5,even better than toy story 1,"yep, the sequel's better than the original. better story, better graphics, more humor. you don't have to be a kid to enjoy this one. it got my attention from the get-go and it never let go until the final credits. buzz lightyear is one of my heroes, now, right up there with those two great americans, george dubya and homer simpson. 'toy story 2' is a film i would consider buying. i don't say that about many films. a must watch."
5,"GREAT set, absolutely no complaints.","What more is there to say? Like the movies enough, get this set with all the extras! It's worth the xtra money!"
5,Ultimate DVD,"Make no mistake about it ... Pixar and Disney set a new standard for computer animated movies with the release of the funny and popular Toy Story in 1995. As if to tempt fate, they released Toy Story 2 in 1999, to greater and funnier claim. Now, they have set the standard for DVD releases with their release of the ""Ultimate Toy Box: Toy Story and Toy Story 2"".I have spent at least three hours of my weekend browsing through the endless streams of information the folks at Pixar developed for us on this stunning release, and that is just on the supplmental disk. Not to mention the bevy of bonuses found on both movies, this release makes for an enjoyable time all around. With interviews, behind the scene vignettes, special effects, and outtakes, you will spend every minute entirely entertained with Woody and the gang.The cost of the DVD is well worth what you get. I highly recommend adding this treasure to your DVD library while you can!"
5,Two amazing movies in one box!,"The first time I saw Toy Story I smiled and laughed throughout the movie. It touched me way down inside in the part of me that has never grown up. Since then it has become one of my all time favorite movies. Toy Story 2 broke the mold of most sequels by surpassing the original. Initially inteded for direct-to-video release, Disney and Pixar realized they had a winner on their hands and enhanced it for the theater. This movie kept me laughing constantly. I had a stomach ache by the end due to constant laughter. These two movies have been on my DVD wish list since I bought my player, and now we get them, plus a full disc of behind the scenese extras! This will be the DVD box set to end all box sets. Don't hesitate! Order it now!"
5,This is as good as DVD video can get,"Wow, all these days I've been enjoying this DVD all alone. Now, I have company from my 2-year old son and guess what? He is driving me crazy with his obsession with this DVD. He doesn't want Barney or anything else on TV but Toy Story. He prefers Toy Story 2. Now, I am finally getting tired watch too much of it EACH and everyday.<the following is my original review>Wow, what quality you can get with 500 line resolution. After I saw this DVD I was wondering how much better can a High Definition DVD can be? I am sure it can't be any better than this!! If it can, I wouldn't notice it. I enjoyed watching it. A great way to start Disney collection. Can't wait for the Bug's Life DVD to get cheaper."
5,Must Own,"If you saw the first Toy Story, you have to get the 2nd. This is one of the most comical box sets ever. It is great for children and adults alike and it has great re-watchability. One of only a handful of sequels to top the original, though the original is pretty good in its own right. If you have kids and like to watch movies with them, you need this DVD."
5,Family favorite!,"My husband and I bought this DVD set for our little boy when he was only 2. We weren't sure if he would like it or not, but it's now one of his favorites! This is a great set for family night or even for a lazy Sunday afternoon. We never get tired of watching Buzz and Woody!"
5,Great combo.,"The movies are very entertaining, as long as you enjoy this sort of film. I think this set was worth it for the outtakes on TS2 alone."
5,toy story 2 pack,toy story is one of the best disney movies ever made I thoroughly enjoyed it as did my children I would recommend everyone watch it a great movie for all ages. When I saw toy story 2 I thought it would`nt be as good as toy story 1 but it was just as enjoyable 2 brilliant movies and what better way to get them than a 2 pack. Definately 5 stars.
5,It is The Greatest,I got both of these from a speical offer from pixar because my friend works there and it is great! If you have seen both the movies than you already know that it is good. But the two DVDs have the short called tins toy and the sound is great. The DVD options let you look at the movie seen by seen the charecter bios tell you about all of your favorite toy story toys. This set is a must get
4,Toy Story - Amazing Animations,"I don't think there is anyone who doesn't like the Toy Story movies, and if you do I strongly recomend you buy this collectors edition 3 disc DVD box set. It's outstanding!"
5,The Ultimate Toy Box goes to infinity and beyond!,"It is a true blessing that these two wonderful movies are being released to DVD in digital glory.When Pixar made Toy Story, it astonished audiences all over the world. A new standard was set in computer animation and fun that everyone can enjoy. When they made Toy Story 2, it astonished audiences even more by being just slightly better in every way: A rare example of a sequal living up to the original. Both movies have true fun adventure with witty dialogue, original characters, and excellent story. As for the computer animation: WOW!Not only do we get 2 great movies, but a 3rd disc that is PACKED full of features. This will be one of the best DVD box sets of all time!"
3,intellectually devoid,"The film was hit and kids love it, but disney films have a way of dumbing things down to the level of a snail. The older disney movies were better written and have real depth to the character development. When Walt Disney ran the company, movies could address scary things, like life, death, politics, ecology and social issues. Disney no longer desires to make great movies. Nor does it know how anymore. Disney needs to kick out all the execs and hire a new team that is willing to make a gamble and strive to create stories and not block busters. The last couple of years, disney movies have been brain drains that lack real substance and is deathly afraid of breaking the disney formula. Sure you're kids will love the movie, but would rather your kids watch a movie that challenges them to understand and learn, or just be entertained."
1,Paul Scheno,"The item ordered was never delivered. I have been told that the UPS delivery person left a note on my daughter-in-law's door. She says that no such notive was ever left. I'm left with the feeling that the order was brought to the wrong address. Lost Creek Circle and Lost Creek Court are just blocks from one another and mail is often confused. I have asked my daughter-in-law to check the post office. So far, no delivery. What do I do about reembursement?"
4,The whole family enjoys this set,"The Toy Story movies are probably my kids' favorite movies. They have new favorites on occasion, but they always come back to Toy Story. The DVD 2 Pack has some good special features as well. I've yet to find a better babysitter than this DVD set. The outtakes are absolutely hilarious."
5,Awesome Movie that is entertaining for kids and adults.,"When Toy Story first was announced it was very excitied (I doubt anyone wasn't). This movie blew me away, the first completely computer generated movie, plus it had a very nice story to tell. The sequel improved on the animation and the plot didn't seem thin and uncreative like other Disney sequels. These two movies are top notch. Animation doesn't get better than this, folks."
5,For Adults or Children,It doesn't matter what age you are-these movies are fun to watch over and over again!! The holidays will be brighter because of the Toy Story movies for sure!!
5,Awesome,I've been waiting for this for a while and was completely happy with itthe movies play great and my boyfriend and I had a nostalgia night <3
5,Perfect DVD for a well rounded collection,"Even though I own relatively few DVD's, including but not limited to childrens, cult classics, horror, and Japanese animation, these two DVD's are my favorites. They were well worth the money I paid for them. Any good well rounded DVD collection should have these in it. This goes especially if you have children."
5,Best fun,"I was resisting for years to watch Toy Story movie. I am not a child and always found better things to do. So now, that I have a kid, I had to force myself to watch it. In the beggining I thout ""oh gosh, it will bore me to death"" but I was so wrong. I got so into it very quickly and found myself really enjoing it. Cuddling up on the couch with my little one for couple of hours was really a bonus. It doesn't happen too often. Great movie for kids and adults alike."
4,Just Toy Story 1 & 2,"If you are looking at this item to purchase, don't be like me and assume that because there is 3 discs that they are Toy Story 1, 2, & 3. The Third disk is extras and not the third movie.The movie's on the other hand where great. I just had to purchase Toy Story 3 seperately."
1,I like getting gouged,"Disney, thanks for putting this set in to the ""vault"". All you've managed to do is create a market of bootlegs, imports and scam artists. How about prosecuting some of the scum?Thanks Disney."
1,short clip,"This is not a movie. It is an over priced (1.99) , 18 min. Clip that actually cuts off mid sentence at 18 min. They do ' even allowthe program to complete."
3,frankford el,"I hope this is the 1970 album by the band American Dream. Not much is known ( or should I say remembered) about them. However they have one song called ""frankford el"", about the local Philly elevated train, which very rarely gets played on the ""classic rock"" station. It's a typical hippie - country good-time tune that tells you why you can't get to Heaven on the frankford el,'cause the frankford el goes straight to... frankford. Fans of the Hooters might get the reference."
5,beyond their first album.,"This CD seems impossible to get, so what I'm looking for probably doesn't exist.The band use to perform a song called ""Fishkin Blues"" which was about their manager. It was suppose to appear on their 2nd album-which never happened. I have 4 copies of the original album (2 of them still sealed). Anyone out there know anything about Fishkin Blues?"
2,Warps,This product does not live up to its billing. It will warp in the oven under medium temperatures. Period. I wish I could get my money back.
1,TOXIC,"I bought 2 of these in February 2010, and they had a horrible, toxic smell that I could not get rid of after hours and hours of baking, multiple times. This happened with some of their cookies sheets as well. The smell is so strong it set off my smoke detectors every time. They obviously made a bad batch. If you can't get rid of the smell after a few times baking (it shouldn't take longer than that, per the manufacturer), return them. You then got part of the bad batch."
3,Not quite perfect,"First, let me just say that I really like calphalon cookware. I have their tri-ply pots which are fantastic. Having said that, however, this baking sheet isn't quite up to their usual. As previously mentioned they do warp even under regular use. Nothing crazy mind you, but there. This is a problem with most baking sheets, but I'll keep looking for that perfect one. Also on my list of perfect baking sheet wants would be the ability to go under the broiler (this one says not to, but I'm sure it would survive to some extent).In response to the raised calphalon brand, I use mine with a silpat mat which alleviates the issue and makes cleanup all that much easier. So in conclusion, sturdier than some, but not the one to pass on down to your children's children."
3,Okay but don't last,The sheets are okay for cookie baking. The calphalon imprinted on the pan is a bit annoying since it's smack in the center. They didn't last as long as I hoped.
2,"Sturdy, but Not Non-Stick","These are really heavy duty cookie sheets, but they aren't really non-stick. We have to oil the pans when we cook pizza or it'll never come out of the pan. I'm sure the pans will last a lifetime, but they have to improve the non-stick."
1,Very flimsy,"I had some very old Calphalon baking pans which just needed replacing. These were no where near the quality of the old pans. As soon as the oven gets to 300 - 350, these ""oil can"" terribly. I could understand if I was broiling with these, but not regular baking. These are called ""jelly roll pans"". If you ever tried to make a jelly roll in one of these pans, as soon as they warp in the oven, you would be sending batter everywhere and end up with a bow tie shaped jelly roll.I can't imagine a use for these pans involving heat."
5,Great product,"Love this pan!!! They call it a jelly roil, but I use it as a cookie sheet. This pan is very sturdy and doesn't warp or lift a cornerwhile baking. It is truly nonstick, cookies slide right off. No Teflon coating to wear off. Used this pan thru out the holidays, and just bought my second one. Works better than the ""air"" baking sheets"
4,"Great quality, weird tag","These pans are great in most ways- very heavy, well made, big. My only complaint is that there is a raised Calphalon brand stamped into the middle of each pan. If you put a cookie or something on that spot, you'd end up with ""Calphalon"" stamped into your cookie!"
1,Poor,"These pans are of poor quality. They warp when heated even at low temps and don't lay flat in your oven once the oven reaches set temp. They settle back to their original shape when cooled, but are not worth the purchase."
1,Buckled in 300 degree oven,"I was making my signature dessert, French macarons with my new pans, what a mistake! They ruined every single cookie and buckled in the oven under 300 degree heat.They felt thick, they definitely weren't the cheapest pans, but they did not deliver. Used them before this to make chicken, that came out fine, but who wants a pan you can only do the basics with?"
1,"Warps, stains, and sticks","I have Calphalon, skillets, bread pans, etc. They are great so I bought the Jelly roll pans expecting the same quality, I was very disappointed. The pans warp even at temperatures as low as 200 degrees Fahrenheit. The food sticks to the non stick surface and after only 5 uses the pans have brown stains all over them that won't come off. I have used cheap 5 dollar pans from walmart that did better than these. Calphalon makes a lot of good products, just stay away from the Jelly Roll pans."
3,13x18 or 12x17?,"These are decent pans, but you can find less expensive at similar quality. However, they are not entirely warp proof. What is more maddening is that I have two generations - an older pan that is marked 13x18 in size and is the exact same size as the newer pans that are indicated as 12x17 in size!"
5,Great Jelly Roll Pans X 2,"These pans are really the best! Besides being the perfect size for my sheet cake recipe, they double as nonstick cookie sheets. My cookies bake evenly, and are easily removed from these pans."
1,I throw it in trash after a few uses,"I used them very occasionally to bake chocolate cookies around 375. It warps, and have stains(can't be cleaned) and become sticky. Then I noticed them full of the tiny spots with the non-stick coating gone so I threw them away (after about 2 years)."
4,"The spirit of the ""Alice"" books in aural form","Del Tredici charts a unique course in 20th century music. He is not scared of tonalism (albeit a rather eccentric tonalism) where and when it pleases him. The Alice compositions, especially the Alice Symphony, remain remarkably true to the spirit of Lewis Carroll's books. Eccentric humour and number games are given their appropriate aural realisations in this work; the certain darkness present in Rev. Dodgson's writings is not absent, either. The musicianship on the recording is exceptional, although it is obviously impossible to compare it with other recordings. Listeners should approach with a fairly open mind . . . although the Symphony is certainly not hard to listen to. Definitely a CD that will impress / intrigue composer and musician friends!"
2,Very unappealing though great interpretation,"Personal taste. I find Del Tredici made little attempt to communicate with the audience in this one. What else is music but to communicate, not to turn off the audience. The voice is extremely irritable and the composition is disjunct."
4,Nice Product,If this is the same thing as ASIN: B000I80ZK4 ....CCM delivered a Body Glove product in Fellowes packaging. The case is a tight squeeze for my palm treo 755p - the phone does not come out of the case smoothly or quickly. The case is well constructed with a non-scuff interior. The dual magnets hold the flap closed very securely. The clip accommodates a belt up to 1.5 inches wide (3.5cm).I purchased three different cases and will probably use this one and send the others back because this one actually stays on my belt. The others slip off because their clip is not big enough.
4,Good reading for folks who want to know more about tube amps,"Gerald's book is actually a compilation of many articles he's written over time. Don't expect long chapters, this is an easy book to pick and read an article when you've got little time on your hands.There's alot of info. on Ampeg, Fender, Marshall, and (of course) Kendricks amplifiers. If you own one of these amps you won't be sorry you bought this book."
4,Gerald Weber is a tube amp guru! Buy it!,"While his books do have some repetition across the series, that is a good thing! I have all of his books and do not feel that I have wasted my money at all! Repeated reading of certain phrases and bits of knowledge will help you to remember them and learn better. It also gives you insight on the way tube amps work. You see how one solution for one amp relates to another solution for another amp and how they are similar. Good reading. Easy reading. Good sense of humor and a no bull attitude make Gerald a good writer. There is a ton of knowledge here. Definitely a must buy if you want to work on your amp yourself."
3,Tube Talk Review,"This writing by amp tech Gerald Weber,touches upon most of the favoriteguitar tube amps in use by musicians. There are many procedures mentionedfor amp modifications and tips on fine tuning various circuits. In manycases, schematics illustrate the changes in circuits, for easy reference.The Desk Top Reference of Hip Vintage Guitar Amps offers much more usable material. This book does offer ideas for player and tech, but does not gointo the detail,nor cover the ground of the first book. It's nice to have for ideas, but not my ""go to"" reference."
5,Lots and lots of patterns,"When making a quilt, I'm usually so anxious to get the quilt done that I don't spend time to make a nice border. But this book changed my mind about that. It's full of border possibilities with clear instructions."
2,Nice piece - wouldn't buy from Amazon,I ordered this piece direct from Amazon because the price was right and the shipping was free. As far as shipping goes I got exactly what I paid for.The box arrived in absolutly horrible condition. Both the shipping box and the product box inside were completly smashed with very little packing material. Had this piece been made of polystone or something less durable than vinyl the figure too would have been crushed.If this is the sort of care Amazon puts into shipping higher end collectables than I will never purchase any other such products from them again.
5,Captivating illustrations childs wonder about the moon,"Does Everyone See the moon as I see it -? this is the question posed by Author May Garelick. Moonlight falls outside a childs window and across the see, and many other places. Leading readers to special places near and far that the moon casts light for all to see. Barbara Garrision's charming illustrations bring these places alive. A favorite of our family is little girl and her cat watching full moon from a dock as a sail boat goes by.... Book recommended for it's pictures -and it's look at a simple yet complex subject kids wonder aboutGrandparents be sure to read this one to all the grand -kids."
5,Apollo in a Nutshell,An exhaustive look at the history of the NASA program wonderfully complied by the author Logsdon. A must read!!!
5,Nephew Loved it,Bought for my nephews birthday... He was so happy when he got it since he had other set to help him complete the full set. HE loves building and playing with these legos. Just happy to know he enjoyed his lego set.
5,Fundraising Demystified,"Tony Poderis reminds all of us who have ever been development officers that it's not rocket science. In his words, ""It's just hard work."" He's right.Poderis's ""Nine Basic Truths of Fundraising"" are worth the price of the book alone. But then he goes on to tell us chapter and verse just how to organize a development department, run a fundraising campaign, and work with volunteer leadership.With over 30 years of fundraising experience, Poderis knows what he writes about. He's done it all and run a major operation as development director for the Cleveland Orchestra.Newcomers and old hands alike will derive tremendous benefit from this book, and every board member should read the Nine Basic Truths.This just could be the best book ever written on fundraising."
5,"The ""Bible"" of fundraising books","I have been a development professional for over twenty years, but Mr. Poderis' book has been, and continues to be, right at reach on my desk as his insights and encouragement have been key to my success as a developmen director of a large arts organization.A more than handy, practical, reference tool which is timeless and always relevant."
2,Hard and Chalky - Hard to Apply!,"I wanted to love this and am very uneasy about the chemicals in sunscreens, but it is a flawed product. It was very hard to get on my sun's face - and he is very patient with sunscreen sticks. You really have to scrape it on, and big white clumps come off and stick to the face, and do not easily rub in. Like i said, i wanted to love it, but it is just not a good product, especially given the high price."
3,sticky sunblock stick,"this sunblock is supposed to be the best for kids, but we found it too sticky to really use. the tube is a nice feature, making it very portable. i like the sunscreen wipes better though."
5,Candy...Candy...Candy,"When my sister first told me about this book, I said ""I don't wanna read that s*!%."" It's been a long time since I've read a book, but after reading that Convict's Candy, I'm trying hard to find a book as good as it was. The book is so full of surprises! I read it in two days and that's because I got sleepy the first day I read. I read over 150 pages the first day. Anyone who has not read this book, PLEASE read it. You won't regret it, I promise. Candy is quite a character. Sometimes you sympathize with her and other times you're like ""that triflin' B!+{H!"" Oh my goodness! READ THE BOOK AND SEE FOR YOURSELF. It's so good, and it won't take long to finish."
4,Entertaining With A Message,The only thing that kept me from giving this book a 5 is the author's self promoting his other book{s} that's annoying! Convicts Candy was a true page turner the sex scene's were raw to say the least but it didn't take away from the story-infact you need them to get the author's point. You won't agree with all of Candy's actions but you will defintly feel for her. It's a drama eye opener and a great read. Too bad the author's are in prison but at least they are doing the time and not letting the time do them. Keep up the good work Brothers!
4,Could Have Been A Five,"but the name dropping was wearing me thin. okay, so the two that wrote the book included themselves in the story, but every other page was Jason giving props to himself and them name dropping Ghetto Heat all over the place. It proved to be a major distraction.Otherwise, Candy was a handful, and I don't mean like M&M;'s. She had everyone on lock, and even though Yalonda warned her about those ""Houses In Virginia"", she still had unprotected sex with several of the inmates. After reading this book, I know for sure that any man I meet that was previously incarcerated will NEVER be an option.The story was really good, in which I read the book in two days, and I will definitely be picking up Larceny by Jason Poole. I'm looking forward to the next work of realistic fiction from these authors.Sistah's beware, your man too could be a homo-thug!"
3,"Great story, bad writing....","Convict's Candy is one of the best stories that I have read in a long time. It is also one of the most poorly written books that I have read. This paradox is why a gave it three stars.The story is worth five stars. The authors draw us into Candy Sweet's world. I could empathize with her during her ordeal and descent downward. The book also brings the HIV pandemic front and center to the reader.The writing is worth zero stars. The authors shamelessly promoted themselves, their publisher and their other books throughout this story. This was a major distraction from the story. A bit of editing to correct some inconsistancies and gramatical errors would have helped also.Although I loved the story, I don't know if I could recommend this book because of the poor writing."
4,One of the best reads I ever had,This book was given to me by a buddy of mine. After the first chapter I was hooked. I got to the point in that I was rooting for Candy. Out of all her many sexual partners you never would've guess it was from the person it was from. Out of 5 stars I gave it 4 because of the ending. Overall the book was awesome.
3,ok,"Happy I received the book, I ordered it used and that it was indeed.... Signature on the front and some spills through out the book, but readable"
3,Everybody had a House In Virginia,This was a very interesting book which I had been looking forward to reading for quite some time! The story had some high points and low points.The beginning started off very good yet the middle kind of dragged along and didnt pick back up until the very end.It also became frustrating when the authors continued to promote themselves in every chapter.I cant say that I was surprised by the ending...I mean what can you expect after reading about all the sexual activity that took place with Candy and the other inmates.It was interesting to read about how each one found out about their House In Virginia.This novel was very enlighting but felt that it also needed some work because it had great potential.
4,Man in the Mirror,"Young Candy Sweets, a male, feels that he was born to be a female and he is determined to take all the necessary steps to become one. She loses family and friends throughout his journey and a special boyfriend. Unfortunately, Candy gets involved with the wrong crowd and soon finds herself behinds scams to financially support her high-profile lifestyle. The good life runs out and Candy is sentence to prison for her crimes. Is this a place for a person in Candy's shoes? Will she survive?""Convict's Candy"" was an exciting novel chronicling a young teenaged transsexual - Candy Sweets, and his journey. This was definitely a good book for women to educate themselves with incarcerated men. I believe this is a subject that everyone should know about because it is the cause to #1 killer in the African American communities - AIDS. I will recommend this book to all and look forward to more of Damon ""Amin"" Meadows and Jason Poole's books in the future."
2,convict candy,The book delivers a serious message regarding the spread of AIDS but reads like a porno book in the process. After reading this book I promptly threw it in the trash. I can't recommend it to anyone with any decency.
2,Poor writing.,I haven't finished the book yet but I am having a very difficult time with the poor writing. I am going to continue on but I would have thought that it would have been edited more thoroughly.
4,BAD BLOOD,"Bad blood or tainted blood in this case touches not only the lustful, the greedy, and the corrupt, but it also destroys families and dreams. A secret never stays hidden but continues to spread like dominoes. What began as a lie brought death to many. Everyone had something to hide in some shape form or fashion. These secrets leads to the lost of friendships, honor and family.The writers did a great job on Candy's character. You could imagine Candy walking around in the system looking like a sheep amongst wolves. A close friend that has been incarcerated once told me about a person like KeKe who enjoyed the flip flopping with unsuspecting young guys that were new to the system. So just know these things depicted in this novel do exist.I recommend that this book should be read by or to these young brothers and sisters out here. A movie could be mad since AIDS is on the rise; there is never too much knowledge for this deadly disease.Reviewed by LOIS-CThe Realest Reviewers"
3,Jus Okay 4 me....,"The message was delieverd str8t no chaser. The House In Virginia aint no joke...this novel was very interesting and informative on what goes on nside the world of a male prison. Most I'm gonna say is ladies if ur man is n prison, and is due 2 be released be aware...once a TraDe always a TrAdE."
3,An acquired taste,"All possible care has been lavished on this ambitious work by Santa Fe-based composer John Kennedy. The settings of interrelated poetic texts, for countertenor/baritone (in this case one person, the marvelously versatile Bruce Rameker), accompanied by a small ensemble, are performed lovingly and expressively by the performers involved.The music itself is of a genre that is very popular nowadays but that I personally find wears quickly: tonal, harmonically simplistic, repetitive and mostly slow and meditative with occasional outbursts of rhythmic energy that for my taste don't come nearly often enough. In short, if you're heavy into New Age meditations about world synergy this is a CD for you. Certainly the people involved make the best possible case for this music."
4,GREAT!,"I am starring in ""The Wiz"" at this time and it's a great, lively musical. I am The Yellow Brick Road, an Oz Citizen and The Head Winged Monkey. It's so cool. The music is awesome and the whole thing is just jivin'."
5,Love it!,"I played the Yellow Brick Road in a version of The Wiz, and it's an awesome show. I will never forget it. ""Ease on Down the Road"" and ""Slide Some Oil to Me"" are probably the best songs. There is no show as creative and imaginative as The Wiz."
3,Somewhat disappointing biography of a South Texas legend,"Reynaldo G. Garza is a giant in the political and legal history of Texas and is most deserving of biographical treatment. All Rise successfully recounts many of the highlights of Judge Garza's life and career. It ultimately disappoints, however. First, the author lacks the legal background necessary to explain the significance of many of Judge Garza's judicial opinions. Second, the book fails to fully introduce the reader to the biographical subject himself, leaving him portrayed as two-dimensional and leaving the reader wanting more."
5,QUAYLE IS THE MAN TO LEAD AMERICA IN THE 21st CENTURY!,"Dan Quayle, our former vice president, does not enjoy the luxury of having free media support and tons of cash. But he has something that GW doesn't: experience, courage, and principle. In WORTH FIGHTING FOR, our former Vice President reveals that his is a vision embraced by the values of the founding fathers and one that must be at the forefront of America's legacy in the 21st Century. In all, Quayle is a dramatically articulate and couragous individual."
1,something missing here,"After reading this book I wondered how such a brilliant man could possibly be unable to spell potato. There is something terribly wrong here. It made me think of the saying of a great American, I can't right now remember which one, but the saying is, ""What a waste it is to lose one's mind. Or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is."" Oh, that's right, it was our man Dan."
3,"Agoraphobia: Simple, Effective Treatment",5 1 13I PURCHASED THIS BOOK AS WELL AS SOME CD S BUT ONLY FOUND OUT MUCH LATER THAT THE MATERIAL ALTHOUGH STILL RELEVANT IS SO OLD THAT SOME OF THE CASES DATE BACK TO THE LATE SIXITIES AND EARLY SEVENTIES:VERY SADLY THE AUTHOR PASSED AWAY IN 1990 AND ALTHOUGHALL THIS WAS NOT MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY ONE HAS TO REALIZE THAT THE MATERIAL IS VERY DATED INDEED; I M SORRY TO SAY:
4,Carolina Mist,"I enjoyed reading Carolina Mist. In fact, it was the first Mariah Stewart book that I had read. From there I have been hooked. The characters, especially the grandmother was totally unique. Romance with a little bit of mystery, laughter, and a friendly ghost! What more could you ask for! The book is about the building of a special relationship between neighboring children while spending summer vacations together. Both continued on with their lives yet neither was complete. The story also centered around personal growth. Everyone should stop once in a while and take stock of what is actually going on in their life. M. Stewart has consistently been able to produce interesting yet above standard Romance books."
3,Romance,"This is obviously one of Mariah Stewart's first efforts. Like all her books, it is well written. It's a gentle, little romance. Not my usual type of reading at all, but not bad for the genre."
4,Good book,"An easy read, enjoyed the book and would recommned her as an author for anyone wanting a light read. Thanks."
3,Carolina Mist,"A seasonable read, acceptable as a light read and a time filler, can be read in short bursts and put down as required"
2,Story too slow,"The setting for the story was great, however, there wasn't enough of a plot to keep my interest for long. I did read the entire book, but it got really boring; too much about the old days and family heirlooms etc. and not enough interaction with the characters. I guessed the end way before the book was finished. All in all, not as great as the author's Mercy series. They kept my interest all the way to the end."
5,Stewart Strikes Again !!!,"You can always count on Mariah Stewart to give you a good read. She creates characters who seem so real that you know that you have met them somewhere. I always look for her new books, and happily re-read her old ones."
1,Doesn't work with MFC 820CW,"I stumbled on this in Amazon when looking for my cartridges. The notion of ""high yield"" appealed to me, but the cartridge has an extra piece on it that prevents it from clicking in to my printer. It's 9/3/11, and of course the free return period has passed. Be careful with the details!"
4,MFC 620CN Fix,"The Amzon description is wrong, the high yeld does not fit the 620CN model. However, if you snap off the extra tabs with a pair of pliers, it fits right in, and seems to be printing happily. Just compare it to the old cartidge, and remove the tabs that don't match, really easy.It's pretty obvious that Brother purposely ""crippled"" the high yield ink so that anyone using the less expensive models (620CN) would have to buy the more expensive ink.So get out your pliers and beat the system........."
2,Does not support MFC210C!!!,Be careful people! It doesn't support MFC210C although the product description at Amazon says so. Actually the box for the toner doesn't list MFC210C. So this is a mistake at Amazon website. I have to return it and buy model LC41BK.
1,Does NOT work with MFC-640CW,"As the other comments here state, this cartridge also doesn't work with the MFC-640CW. If you break the offset black plastic tab off with a set of plyers/cutters, it can be made to work."
2,Does not work with MFC-420CN . . .,"although I did as one reviewer suggested and clipped the tab and it works now. The color is brilliant. No problems at all.The reason I bought this is because I did once buy high yield black ink for my MFC-420CN, so I think the manufacturer did at one time allow this cartridge to work with the MFC-420CN. Maybe that's the reason some reviewers say it works and some don't.If you bought this by mistake, do as the previous reviewer recommended and clip the tab. I may buy another one of these just to save some money."
4,wow cool,this is greatit fits in my handand u can adjust the sizeit goes very fari shot it across our school gym at my teacher
5,Best buy ever!!!,"My daughter looked on-line for furniture to replace the bunk beds that her and her sister just sold. She found Southshore furniture and showed me that not only did the wood match the dressers that we already had - but the price was reasonable. We purchased two Twin Mate beds and the Bookcase headboards. My husband and I were able to assemble both headboards within 1 hour. We assembled the beds as easily, but experienced a problem with the second unit. We found that all of the long boards had been broken in half - though we were dumbfounded as to how since the packaging was intact. Nonetheless, one call to the Southshore number located on the instruction sheets, and we had the replacement boards within 10 days. Though this lengthened the amount of time one of our daughters had to sleep on the floor, it was well worth the wait when we saw what the finished products looked like. Really happy with the furniture and would recommend it."
4,South Shore bookcase head board and platform bed,"My daughter and I bought this bed and head board. It was relatively easy to put together, since all the directions were just drawings. It probably took us longer than someone who does this more often. It was made of pressed wood with a pine veneer. Rather nice looking bed and seems to be sturdy. It is rather on the heavy side but not that bad. We were able to move it easy enough, since we are two women and not that tall. She is quite happy with the bed and the price wasn't too bad."
1,Warning,I don't know if this product looks nice or not. I ordered it by mistake along with the matching bed. I was able to cancel the bed before shipping but not the headboard.It shipped and arrived...I went online to schedule a return and was charged $33.00 for return shipping after already paying to have it shipped. Buyer beware. Don't order by mistake because they say it's your fault. nice company.
4,Hoo-wee!,I'll admit...I'm a sucker for the cover. I love his hair. This matches his 2005 album and includes 'Lot of Leavin' Left to Do' and 'Come a Little Closer.'
1,'Cracking the GMAT' won't get you there,Go straight for the Official Guide to GMAT Review from ETS. I spent a month working through Cracking the GMAT from Princeton Review and now find myself 3 weeks away from test time and completely ill prepared. Princeton Review tests told me I was doing great - when I started working on real GMAT problems I was completely lost. Half of the techniques taught are not unsed on the real test and the concepts taught in the Princeton Review are so rudimentary it is laughable. Skip this book - waste of time.
1,Continues to remain dismal and disappointing,"The book is an absolute waste of time as is the CD ROM. There is no change in the trategies recommended from 1999, even though the test as significantly changed. Further, the CD ROM is absolutely pathetic. When it does work, without crashing the computer many times, after the entire test, it fails to score the test and far worse, does not even recorrd your answers for review. So in essence, you have spen 3 hours for nothing. In the verbal section, the resding comp. questions are distorted. You get three diff. reading comp questions successively and then the same passage is repeated after a few questions.I grade it with a one star, as there does not seem to be a lower number. I would strongly recommend the official guide and the Kaplan guide, if you do not wist to waste your time and money."
1,Not helping!,"I took the exam a few days ago, got 720. I bought 4 books from Amazon to help me study. Which are ""Insider's"", ""Kaplan 800"", ""Crash Course"" and this one. Since ""Crash Course"" is designed for last-minute review so let's count it out. Of other 3 books, ""Cracking the GMAT"" is the worst. It tends to make things too complicated and its sample questions are not well-designed. Not to mention the CD that comes with the book is [bad]. You can easily tell that Princeton Review didn't pay much attention to make this book a good one. Since if you fail to get a high score from reviewing with this book yourself, you end up register their more expensive taught courses.So, anyone wants to get a good score at GMAT, here is my sequence: Insider's (read it all) --> Kaplan 800 (the CD is really great, comapring to Cracking's) --> Princeton Review (only practice the questions) Trust me! I just spent 1 month with an average study time of less than 3 hours a day. And I got 720!..."
2,disappointing,"I just finished using the 2002 version of this book and I have to warn potential buyers to stay away. Not only was the book unclear in so many places but there were typos all over the place, I found a bunch of wrong answers and incorrect directions. There were definitely some helpful tips but they weren't outweighed by the sloppy editing. Try something else first."
2,Math Bad - Verbal Good,This book is a good start.But math is weak. In fact terrible.The verbal section is good.
5,Perfect for all levels - esp. for a serious newbie,"This is by far the best yoga CD that I own - and I've worked with many. As a newbie, this provided the perfect level of practice. also had great music, clear instructions, and was the perfect length. I highly recommend...lee"
2,My least favorite of the series,"The Gold Coast: Three Californias (Wild Shore Triptych)This is my least favorite of the three books. In this story the characters, who match up with similar characters in the other two books, seem to be pretty useless since they spend their time partying and doing customized drugs of the day. This book was hard to get into and I never really got to know or like any character. The main character spirals out of control and the book never really goes anywhere. All three books are unsatisfactory but this one more so. This author has other books that I like much better.In each of the three books the individual concept sounds like a good story line. But it's like the author just wants to experiment with placing the same characters in different settings. So each concept seems like back ground for that process. If there was a message about society, in it's variations or anything else, I missed it."
2,Dated vision of the future,"The premise of this novel is an interesting one: in the near future, in an overdeveloped Orange County, California, a dissatisfied poet becomes involved with industrial terrorists bent on subverting the war and weapons industry, in which his father is employed. But the writing is stilted and disjointed and interrupted at odd points by rather nonsensical poems. And Robinson's vision of the future doesn't ring true either. Even writing at the end of the 1980s and able to foresee sprawl run amuck and auto-piloted cars on unending freeways, he still completely overlooks the importance of the Internet or digital information in future society. The presence of videotapes and CDs in Robinson's 2027 now makes the novel seem hopelessly dated."
3,Where are the grace notes?,"For the most part Finale Songwriter was very good. The computerized instruments that allowed me to hear my music before I printed it was great. It was not completely the same as a real musician, but I know that will never be possible. The note placing on the staff was so easy and allowed me to write chords so much faster than by hand. Many of the advanced techniques that I wanted to use such as grace notes were not there. I expected all Finale products to have these features. I was severely disappointed when I found that these features were missing. It is very frustrating to me to purchase Finale Songwriter just to find out that I need to purchase the more advanced, more expensive Finale."
2,"Easy, powerful, but flawed.","Makes manual entry of songs about as easy as it could be. For those more accomplished musicians, you can use the midi interface to play your songs in. Transposes keys easily. Issues I found are with coda handling and help. Little control over formatting of coda measures and reformatting of the entire document sometimes results in coda running off the page. There is a lot of help, but relative to things like how to format coda, entry and control of 1st & 2nd endings, etc,. it was limited and not very helpful. I ended up upgrading to the next verion. PrintMusic, which provided better handling and additional features I wanted."
2,Beware--you can't use this program to open documents created in 2009 Finale Products!,"Finale Songwriter 2007 is a cool program BUT you can't use it to open documents created using Finale's 2009 products. Finale Notepad (Finale's entry level program) was required for my music theory class at Berklee. Instead of purchasing this $10 product, I decided spend to the extra $30 to get Finale Songwriter. It didn't take long to figure out that I couldn't open some of my assignments and ended up having to ""downgrade"" and purchase Finale Notepad 2009 (now I have both). Ironically, every time I open Finale Notepad 2009, it prompts me to ""upgrade"" to Songwriter 2007--don't do it!"
2,Ok for beginning to intermediate composers,"This particular Finale product is too basic for truly advanced composers/musicians. You can't change time signatures or keys mid-song...there aren't even grace notes. It only transposes the most basic music. If you play above an 8 or so, it won't keep up with you. We even tried it at a 5, and it missed some stuff. It works at a basic level, which is why I gave it a 2, but the features are very limited! Go for/use the advanced, expensive programs if you're at that level. We did and are MUCh happier! This particular program would be Great for a beginner, though!"
2,"Good in some aspects, has some glaring wieaknesses","This program has some very good features, including a feature to convert MIDI into WAV, or printing several stanzas in a score. If you get everything figured out before setting up the score, it is great. However, the question is how many people figure it out exactly what they want at the beginning? If you decide you want to add or delete a track after setting it up, then you have problems. This is especially true if you are trying to import material from another program (eg Cakewalk)."
4,good price for decent product,"Although I have not used this as much as I'd like, I still enjoy using it and and looking forward to doing so more."
1,Worthless,"Nothing worked. The instruction book didn't get past page 4 before confusing G Major with F Major. The ""Simple Entry Pallette"" wasn't there in the display, and no clue how to find it. ""Tutorial 1"" wasn't available from any of the menus at the top of the page. ""Hyperscribe"" sort of works, but cleaning it up with edits, you're better off with pen and paper. After now weeks of trying to get this to work, I'm trashing it."
5,Music Student,This is the first time I've ever used songwriting software but the best I can tell Finale Songwriter '07 is a good program. The instructions were simple and easy to read.
4,Finale Songwriter,"I've found this product easy to use and was more than worth the price I paid for it. I'm impressed with the ease of transposing my music into what ever key I wish to use.The only problem I've had is being able to access this on my 2 computers. I have a computer in my studio that I would like to use sometime, but I would have to buy a second copy, even though I am the only user. I will buy a second copy because I believe it's worth it."
3,review on Finale,"I have really enjoyed this product, putting in songs that already exsist and doing some of my own. I was disappointed, though, with the fact that Finale Songwriter 2007 is based on round notes and not shaped notes. That is what I have been looking for, but am still impressed and appreciate my purchase! Thank you!"
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH 10.5.5,"warning, this does not work with 10.5.5. called customer support and they weren't very helpful. basically you just need to buy the more expensive version to be leopard compatible. very frustrated."
2,Regurgitation of well-known facts and college textbooks factoids,"This book may have been written by a real teacher, but you will learn absolutely nothing new about working with kindergarten kids from her. The authors regurgitate well-learned ideas and praise themselves for the ""novelty"" of incorporation of these in practice.This book may be somewhat well suited for new-graduates, that yearn for examples of how things work. But even new graduates eventually develop an aversion to the patronizing self-praising style of these authors.Dont waist your money, buy something else!"
4,I give it a 4,The book had many wonderful ideas for kindergarten.....not so many for preschool age. I wish I had bought a used copy $$$$$.
5,Best introductory Python book,"A very fine book about Python!It's for beginners but describes and teaches also up-to-date Python features new inPython 2.2. And the best of it all, there are ten projects which were a pleasure toplay with. I hope Apress is going to publish more Python books of this quality!"
2,Left wondering,"I'm really starting to wonder about these whole Amazon review system. I mean, these reviews so far reflect nothing about what I've personally found this book to be. All of those things sound strikingly like advertisements as opposed to honest feedback. I doubt this Amazon thing is worth anything anymore, but whatever. This book was dry, drab and incomplete in many ways. It never delivered what it promised. I can't say I'm a beginner at Python, so perhaps that was the problem. But I'd stay away from this book and perhaps look at one of Oreillys titles."
