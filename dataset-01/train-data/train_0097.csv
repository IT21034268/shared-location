5,"Excellent shoes, finally buying a new pair after 10 years!","My husband and I both bought Merrell hiking boots 10 years ago before a trip to Europe. They've been all over Europe, climbed a few mountains, done a lot of hiking and walking, and are still structurally sound. We both agree they are the best shoes we've ever worn. They are comfortable and stable. The only reason I am buying a new pair is because the material at the toes is finally starting to wear...but it took 10 years to get that way!"
5,Love this hiking shoe...light on my feet,"My husband purchased these shoes for me for Christmas to replace a pair of Columbia hiking sneakers that I had worn for years. We hike our mountain often so I needed a pair of sneaker type shoes with good support. They fit true to size, felt supportive without being too restrictive, and were lighter on my feet than they appeared. I also use them for walking around town and running errands. I've also gotten compliments on them from friends who also are active hikers. I would recommend these shoes to anyone who is a casual weekend hiker or for general walks for fitness."
5,Best walking shoe ever!,"These are my ""go to"" shoes. I have worn them all over the world, as well as around home. They are great for uneven surfaces, excellent support. My knees don't ache like they used to."
5,Great shoes,These are the second or third pair of these shoes I've purchased and they are perfect for light hiking and everyday wear. At one local store I was told that they get more repeat buyers for this shoe than any other. I'll likely buy another pair when these wear out. Won't be for awhile though - they wear well and last a long time.
4,Blues pedal,Excellent pedal for the money. Nice job by digitech once again. Fares well against more popular brands that are a littl pricier.
1,Maybe I got a Lemon or product is not well made?,"I bought it for my husband for his birthday. It worked twice and then just didn't work again. We bought a new battery and tried that- but nothing. We didn't do anything to it, it was brand new and my husband takes good care of all of his music equipment. There was a couple of weeks between the first time he used it and the second time and then two more weeks when we discovered it no longer works (he mostly plays acoustic guitar). I bought it from Austin Bazaar (I still have the receipt). I was so disappointed in it that we just put it back in the box and shelved it."
5,A Man with a Warm Sense of Humor,"I loved Ronald Reagan and one of the things I enjoyed so much about him, was his marvelous sense of humor. He made me laugh all over again. I love the DVD. It is very uplifting."
5,Ronnie at his best!,This is a great tape showing President Reagan's beautiful sense of humor. It left us wishing that it lasted longer.
2,Some reviewers sniffing glue?,"It is fine to like this music, but to call it ""proto-punk"" is a total misnomer. That line you've heard about punk being about attitude, not music? It's a lie. Whatever lifestyle choices the term connotes, it most definitely does specify a type of rock 'n' roll, and ""The Music Power from Okinawa"" most definitely has nothing in common with it. Shonen Knife? Punk rock. REO Speedwagon? Not punk rock. Green Day? Perhaps a matter of opinion, but judging strictly from Amazon's sound clips, Shoukichi Kina makes them sound like the baddest, most strident, least socially acceptable punk band on earth. Sorry to rain on the parade, but I've read two reviews alluding to the ""punk"" nature of this album, and I have better things to do than to spend time previewing a mislabeled recording and be reminded that some ignorant music writers can't fathom the most obvious fine-points of pop-music analysis."
1,Electricity and Magnetism (Usborne Understanding Science),"This brief book is useless except, perhaps, at a kindergarten level."
5,I Have Great Love For This Battery,"I bought this battery a few months after I got my phone just so I could have a spare battery, but now I use it as my main battery. It lightened up my phone and gave it a sleeker look. The talk time I get on this battery is better than the origainal, and the same goes for the stand by time. If your looking for a new battery this is the one you want!"
3,Good Book - Shopping Cart on CD has Problems,"As a newcomer to Coldfusion, I felt like this book was clearly written and easy to understand. However, I bought the book primarily for the shopping cart code included on the CD. After several days I was able to get this cart working but I did find a few problems in the design.Being a newcomer to Coldfusion, I contacted the author. He was at first helpful, but his last answer to me was ""the store was primarily meant to illustrate certain points and integrate everything that had been learned up to that point in the book. Unfortunately, i can't troubleshoot every eventuality. if you discover the answer, i can post it on the site as a ""fix"" with your name.""Buy the book, but use the shopping cart as a learning tool only."
2,Warning!!!!,just got the connectors today and apparently 2 pin speakon connectors will only work with 2 pin speakon cables... thanks for the heads up Parts Express..
2,"poor production values, but a page turner","When I first read in PC Gamer about Clancy's new book and game about anti-terrorist operations, I was really excited, being an avid fan of the SAS. I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of the book in Australia, but when I first saw it, I was disappointed by the bland cover and photocopy- paper quality of the book. Nevertheless, I bought the book in anticipation of a gripping and realistic story as only Clancy could write. I was however, disappointed by the obvious lack of discipline of Rainbow Six members after each operation, in particular the talking to rescued hostages and one of the members smoking a pipe in full view of the TV cameras. It was fairly predictable that the Russian ex-spy Popov would catch on later. Definitely not up to Clancy's usual accuracy on military operations, but it was a page-turner nonetheless."
3,"Not his best effort, but still Clancy","Too predictable and plodding for Clancy. As usual, excellent character development and attention to all the details needed to thread the story together. But the story just is not plausable. Operational securtity could never be maintained for such a preposterous plot. Disappointing."
1,War-Horse Clancy Running Out of Oats?,"The episodes of an elite counter-terrorist unit in action make for decent escapist reading. Beyond that, Clancy makes use of an uninspired, all-too-familiar biowarfare system taken directly from his last book. John Clark becomes judge, jury, and executioner at the ending which is at once rushed and trite. There are pages of tangential dialog that can be skipped without being missed, but unfortunately each reader has to discover this individually. In Mr. Clancy's defense (and I am a fan from the first) what does one do for an encore, especially when Jack Ryan is now the President of the United States? To see John Clark become an unprincipled vigilante is disappointing."
4,Tom Clancy Gets Better and Better!,"I've been a fan of Tom Clancy's work since his first book. He just gets better at writing and at capturing his reader's attention and interest. With Rainbow Six, I realized that I couldn't put the book down and when I did, I couldn't wait to get back to it to find out what the Six team were doing. That's because Tom Clancy has mastered the art of giving detailed scenes and background information without boring the reader as sometimes was the case in his previous books. I enjoyed very much reading Rainbow Six and getting to know better John Clark and his family. However, I cannot wait to read more about what Jack Ryan is doing as the President! I am very much looking forward to reading that story."
1,Too much inconsequential detail. This book really drags.,"Bought Rainbow Six and had high expectations. Expected a fast paced and action packed read, similar to Clancy's earlier novels (Hunt for Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin, et al.) but got just the opposite. The novel drags as a result of Clancy's painstaking descriptions of the inconsequential. The book could be edited at least in half, or maybe two thirds could be edited away and the story line wouldn't much suffer."
2,"Caricatures, stereotypes and an impossible plot","What else can I say? It's the nature of the publishing business that Clancy could write his laundry list and people would buy it. Don't buy this. Go look up Bob Mayer and buy some of his Riley series special forces books. Mayer was in special forces and knows what he's talking about. He also doesn't waste your time with fast-paced, to the point stories. Try CUT OUT, based at Fort Bragg and involving a special forces soldier in the Witness Protection Program. Or DRAGON SIM-13 which reminded me a lot of Fail Safe except using a special forces team instead of a bomber. Every time I get on board a Combat Talon for deployment I wonder . . ."
1,Predictable!!!,"Why did I buy this book? Answer, ""Tom Clancy has written many books which I enjoyed no end. They could be re-read more than once and still be enjoyable."" Sadly Tom Clancy has used up all his credit with this one.It doesn't get off the ground at any point. Although it is a ""speed read"" it never captures the reader like ""Cardinal of the Kremlin"" , ""Clear and present danger"" or ""The sum of all fears"" did. It hasn't got the ""I must read one more page or else..."" feeling that his previous books had. It is as predictable as watching paint dry - and you feel just as cheated afterwards. Read ""Cardinal of the Kremlin"" and remember the good old days, when Clancy still knew how to write."
3,Too wordy,"When I received this book, my first impression was that it was too big. Upon reading it, I felt as though the editors could have cut the book in half and made it more interesting and less repetitive in its descriptions about the characters and the training. At least we recouped some of its cost with the amount of paper it used."
1,"Clancy's loosing it; too political, not clever","Clancy's last three books have been very poor. He increasingly injects his stories with his own extreme right-wing political point of view. This becomes very tiring and is not a believable makeup of his characters. The right-wingers are the saviors, anybody else is a cold, bloodthirsty lunatic. How boring. And how often does the reader have to be reminded of what each character's intentions are? Each individual in the book has to repeat how they feel and what they're thinking about three dozen times. In school, this was considered ""fattening"" for length rather than content. The result in RAINBOW SIX is that the story gets continually bogged down."
2,"Stupid plot, but still entertaining!","Tom Clancy is the master of the techno-thriller but this book lacks the ""techno"" of his others. The premise of an international anti-terrorist unit is great but the villains were absurd. With the fall of the USSR and frequent use of middle eastern terrorists, I guess militant environmentalists are the only bad guys left. The book's saving grace are its protaganists, Clark and Chavez. The bio-warfare was done to death in his last book and he needs a new threat to the world. It's good mindless summer reading, but if you're expecting a good ""Tom Clancy"" novel, maybe you should check out his earlier works (Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger). Despite my comments, I'm still the first in line to buy his books!"
4,Great Story and Action . . .,"This is the first Clancy book I've read and I really enjoyed it. The action was non-stop and the story was very engaging. I especially liked the way Clancy details the battle scenes. Even though the vividness may seem gruesome it makes the action seem real. One beef though is that Clancy backs off on detailing the battle episodes as the book moves on. It almost seems like Clancy felt the book was getting to long so he cut down on the description. All in all this being my first Clancy book, I will probably eventually read the rest of them. If you like stories about covert government or paramilitary action this book is an excellent read."
5,The Book is Better than the PC Game,"I originally played the Rainbow Six computer and N64 game, so I thought the novel would be a great read. I wasn't disappointed and Clancy delivered a knock out novel. It starts off like all of the Clancy novels I have read, with a plane hijacking of ex-CIA agent John Clark and his new son-in law and his partner Domingo Chavez. Clark is the leader of a new black counter-terrorism outfit code named RAINBOW. Chavez leads one of the two teams located at the SAS base in Hereford, England. Clancy weaves a great plot involving a huge bio-technology company, a security agency handling the 2000 Olympic Games and an ex- KGB agent. The world gives RAINBOW lots of work and they rise to the task. This is one of the best novels I have ever read, great action, it keeps its readers on their toes and unable to put this awesome novel down."
3,more stuff than just on the surface,Good book with a non-trivial plot. The only problems I have are multi-page boring journeys into beer drinking details and family matters.
1,Save your time and money,What a poor book this is. Gone are the days of the techno-thriller for a re-hash of previous plots and performers.
4,Makes you think about the possibilities!!!!!!!!,As usual Clancy is ahead of the game. He really gives us something to think about and the possibilities of what crazy minds will do.
1,Cartoonish,"Let's face it. This book is one long cartoon. The good guys? Not a scratch on 'em. The Bad guys? Nuke 'em. The good guys? Fine, upstanding family men. The bad guys? Dysfunctional low-lifes. Clancy's politics? To the right of Rush Limbaugh. Clancy's women? In the kitchen (or the hospital ward) where they belong. The plot was laughable. And I used to be a Clancy fan."
1,"Way Too Long, Lazy Writing","Absolutely the last Clancy novel I read. Mr Clancy is getting lazy in his wealth. His research used to be maticulous in every detail. As an Air Force Special Ops pilot I can say this one is full of slip ups.Another 900 page plodding novel that, typical of his books, takes the first 700 pages to get it's act together. Then he cobbles together the last 100 pages. Too bad, he used to write really good books."
3,"An interesting read, but too long and rambling.","The premise of this novel is interesting enough...eco-terrorists want to cause an epidemic to wipe out most of humanity in order to ""save"" the environment. Of course there are nutcases out there who would probably like to do just that, and as Clancy's novel postulates, it is not out of the question that some of them could conceivably put a plan into work to attempt something of the sort.This novel's strengths are Clancy's familiarity with military technology (as always) and his fairly good grasp of how Washington's power structure functions. These strengths make this a fairly good read, despite the negatives. The negatives are that this novel is at least twice as long as it needs to be, the storyline rambles, the terrorists are unconvincing, and the characterizations are not particularly good.All in all this is a good cautionary tale by a good writer who needed a stricter editor."
1,It's typical Tom Clancy: It's too much.,"Rainbow Six is all too representative of what Clancy has done since his first book, The Hunt For Red October. Rainbow Six is overwritten and underedited. It will become a best-seller on the strength of Clancy's name, but since Red October, which was a very fine tale, he's done only good book. That was Clear and Present Danger."
4,Good but not his best,The action is fast paced but one- dimesional. The characters just are not as developed this time. Not really disappointed but it could have been better.
3,As a retired special forces soldier,I found this book distasteful. We serve because we believed in our country and its laws-- the men I worked with were professionals and would not take the law in their own hand. Clancy is a former insurance salesman who makes a buck off of these men. You want good special ops books-- try Andy McNabb's SAS books or Bob Mayer's Special Forces books-- they were there and know the reality.
3,"Very dissapointing, not up to Clancy Standards","Ahh, too predictable, too many ""coincidences"", not enough realism. What are the chances that the worlds best counterterrorism team is going to be on the same 1 in a billion airplane that gets highjacked? The ""professionals"" make stupid, ametuer mistakes constantly! Not up to pre-clancy greatness. The plot was VERY anticlimactic. The end was very drawn out, instead of the action packed, last chapter punch, with a one page post-logue like most of clancy's other works. I love clany's other books, and Red Storm Rising is my all time favorite book, ever. Go buy Red Storm Rising!!! p.s.- The PC Game ""Rainbow Six"", and its sequal game, ""Rouge Spear"", are the best games ever made, these i HIGHLY recommend. You will not regret it!!!!!!!!!"
2,An exciting book attacking the environmental movement.,"I have read most of Clancy's books, and, as time goes on, they offer more and more of Clancy's political and philosophical views and less and less story and excitement. Rainbow Six is also a thinly disguised attack on the environmental movement, dismissing such organizations as the Sierra Club as fanatical, with a strong implication that environmentalists are exceptionally naive at best and extremely stupid at worst. They are all emotional ""tree and bunny huggers,"" rather than thoughtful and intelligent people. Clancy continues to be enamored with organizations like the CIA and the FBI, who alone have the welfare of the country in mind. I think this is the last Clancy book I will read."
3,In and of itself it's O.K. But not Clancy's best........,"From a die hard Clancy fan that has read all of his books, I found this book somewhat disjointed. I was dissapointed that no real mention of Jack Ryan was made. I would have prefered to have known about the power structure of the world. For most of the book, you don't even know who is the president of the U.S. The setup of the book seemed to be rushed. It is the first Clancy book that I found easy to put down.This book is a spin off from a previous Clancy series without an updated from that series. In all I found it wanting."
2,Plot line is simple; full of errors,"Though the plot outline is intriguing, Clancy has developed an annoying habit and going into extraneous detail. This gets him, or his proofreader, lost. Character names are changing within a few pages (Tim, then Tom, then Tim); new characters suddenly appear and interact as if they have been introduced before; mystery characters are revealed accidentally in conversations (confirming one's suspicions) and then are dumped back into the shadows for later revelations. Sorry, I've enjoyed Clancy's earlier works but I've lost my taste for details of minutiae (e.g. what they ate for breakfast), repitition of character's motivitations and lack of details on key events in character's lives (Ding's wife's delivery is quickly passed over though we hear about the team's morning routine ad nauseum)."
4,Clancy at his best,"Rainbow Six was one of the best books I have ever read. It had action, suspense, drama, and a lot more. I loved the novel and would recommend it to anyone. I would personally love to see it become more than just a novel and game. I'd really like to see it become a movie. However I do admit there might be a bit too much dialogue. The book would have to be a long movie to get it all in however."
3,"Geat writing but, alas, plot predictable.","Tom Clancy's technical understanding and ability to translate the excitement of technology, if you will, provides interesting reading. But the plot of this story was disappointingly bland. RAINSBOW SIX is a special secret unit formed to combat terrorist activities. But through a series of not-so-innocent Q & A's and overlooked details becomes not-so-secret very quickly. A save-the-earth organizationof manic mentality is manipulating the world terrorsism scene to divert attention from its plan to use biological means to cleanse the earth of all but a chosen few. A former Russion spy is on the payroll of the save-the-earth organization until he discovers its ultimate aim, then jumps ship to inform Rainbow Six of the pending biological catostrophe. The outcome, as I mentioned earlier, is no surprise."
3,"OK, could have been better","I'm not a big fan of flaming anyone--this book is entertaining to an extent-- I wish the good guys could have been more human, which would have added more suspense. I took one of the other reviewers advice and read a couple of Bob Mayer's books-- very good and realistic. The good guys make mistakes, the bad guys aren't stupid and the action seems real given the author is a former special forces officer. I'm hoping Clancy gets back into Hunt form soon."
2,Please bring back the Clancy of old.,Tom Clancy seemed to be filling pages as if he has a contract for somany words. The idea of the book was solid but came across in rather boring and repetative way. It wasn't hard to figure out how things would go. One bright spot is Tom is continuing to develope tried and true characters.
1,violent right wing extremist garbage,"The worst book i've read in a long long time. very bad editing, and completly subjugated to the reactionary and ultra right wing political agenda of Clancy. It tells us that the only way to be a real man is to have a male child and that women are only good for having children and quailing before the macho superiorty of their men."
1,Major plot flaw,"Mundane book with two dimensional characters marred by a major plot flaw.When it's summertime here, it's winter in Australia. Why would they need a multimillion dollar cooling system?"
1,My girl friend's vibrator could write something much better,"You're old, you can't write something new, but you're famous by now. What could you do? Retiring? Certainly not. You still have readers, you still have obligations, you can't just move to Mexico and live like a hermit. What should you do?The catch word is: multimedia. Binary rules.That's probably why the ex-King of Techno-thriller needs to publish such a lousy book without ashamed for its low quality. Because it sells the video game. We old timers may not like this book, but some kids with much money that can burn a hole in their pockets will buy the video game of the same title. That's the point. If it's just a game, it'll have to fight any other games in a fair game. With a name like Clancy's, it's going to sell. If you don't read, or can't read, you can still play the game. You can still pay for it. That's the point.Can't wait to see if Michael Crichton's upcoming _Timeline_ will follow the same logic like Clancy's. Hope not."
1,Never again....,"Anyone who writes a book that long makes it up as he goes and this product is no exemption. He has so much fill in material in it that one forgets who the people are when he names them after 300 pages.That's why the movies are good, someone else rewrites the book and it comes out good in a 1.5 hour movie.No, way too much info I don't need to know."
1,Not worth reading,"My expectations weren't high, but this book failed to meet them anyway.I was looking for enjoyable, light reading. Instead, this book turned out to be a long boring story about lifeless, flawless commandos killing off the ""bad guys"".The plot is rediculous. The narration is repetitive. The ending is morally questionable - justice is sacrificed in the name of expediency."
1,Total lack of research,"I made it through 100 pages and had to give up. The dialogue was stilted the characters bland and the reaserch was totally wrong.Just to let you know Tom, the RCAF ceased to be in the sixties with the unification of the Canadian Air Force, Army and Navy. This created what is known as the Canadian Armed Forces. The base at Gander is known as CFB (Canadian Forces Base) Gander.I stopped reading when the character Popov was travelling on a US passport because his employer arranged for him to become a resident alien. Sorry Tom but only US citizens may travel on a US passport.What happened to the level of accuracy of Red Storm Rising? The exciting plot and interesting characters of Hunt for Red October?It wasn't worth the time or effort to read. I am glad I borrowed this book from the library instead of throwing away good money."
5,tom clancy's most extraordinary novel.,i have read most of tom's books and this is one of the best ones (so says me)
1,A lot to say about nothing.,"This long, long book lacks characteriztion, believable plot, and a purpose. I knew about the same before I read the book as after. Too much discussion about cleaning and caring for one's guns. All the characters were shallow and lacked all emotion. The only real character was the former KGB agent and even he lacked substance. 750 pages of wasted time. I can't believe I read the whole thing. I would not recommend this book for any reason except a cure for insomnia."
2,Contrived and Cliche Ridden,"This was a terrible book. Right-thinking fascists blow the daylights out of horrible, menacing tree huggers. The characters were so unreal it was hard to finish the book. It would have been much better to portray the trained killers (the supposed heroes)as tortured ambivalent souls rather than caring family men. Caring family men do not become covert operatives, stroking their guns for a living. Also Clancey allows his own disdane for environmentalists to show through and often allows his characters to preach to the reader."
1,Clancy at his worst.,"As a long-time Clancy fan, I was deeply disappointed with this latest effort. The plot was lame, the ideology was shallow (and endlessly repeated) and the characters nanometer thin. Looks to me like Clancy has gotten so big for his britches that he has demanded publication of his first draft without meddling by a copy editor -- and that was a big mistake."
3,The latest Clancy is heavy going.,"Having read all of the previous Jack Ryan/John Clark novels I was looking forward to this, but was in many ways disappointed. The story doesn't really come together and move at the usual Clancy pace till around page 550, which makes the first two thirds of the book very heavy going. Also, we learn nothing new about John Clark, yet one of the subtler pleasures of the previous novels was the gradual unfolding of his character. The plot is, in part, a rehash of Executive Orders and is weaker than Clancy's usual standard. Finally, while I always realized the man is right wing, it's now begining to get in the way of his writing - feral greenies indeed! And check out the jacket photo - the man's begining to think he's John Clark (or is that Jack Ryan?!)."
4,Classic Clancy! Yet another plausible ride of your life.,"Clancy has a great opener for the set up to the story. Many will remember the mid 70's and through the 80's as hostage ridden. This story will take you into the world of the terrorist like no other. Clancy delivers a high impact ride through the world of those who would terrorize and those whom the terrorist themselves fear. As a military officer some would say that I am biased to this type of reading as it is a story line that is of great military interest, however, Clancy does his homework and has your attention from start to finish with a storyline that reaches global proportions and has you guessing. The reader is not just treated to the story of what is going to happen, but all the behind the scenes detail that rounds out the story, bringing it to a greater level of reality.A great read."
3,long and predictable.,"I believe that Clancy could have taken this particular plot and added more excitement to it. It would have added if Clancy could have developed what the world would be like as the population began to die off. Instead, he begins a plot that evolves nicely and then ends the book with a very predictable outcome which left me flat. I felt robbed after reading for over 700 pages."
2,Clancy still loves guns!!,"Does Clancy ever tire of being a stereotype? Let's see - Bad guys: tree-hugging eco-terrorists, Good guys: anybody who knows their way around a Heckler&Koch submachine gun. These types of war-worshipping authors have become a little tired in this post Cold-War era. They were entertaining when there was a real enemy that was capable of competing with the Western Allies, but nowadays they have to stretch pretty far for a story. It's always amusing to see that the He-men in these books are married to nurses (more nurturing you know). Thus the scene is set:""Gee Honey, how can you kill somebody? Doesn't it feel bad?""""Heck HoneyBuns, I'm proud to protect you with this machine gun!"""
2,Unnecessary graphic violence.,This book did not live up to the level of good writing the other books by Clancy have achieved.
2,A weak effort by Mr Clancy- recommend other thriller writers,"With this overly long book, Tom Clancy is opening the door for other thriller writers to gain the prominence they deserve. I personally prefer to read writers who have some background in what they write about, not those who invent everything. Stephen Coonts is a former combat pilot who knows whereof he writes. Bob Mayer, whether writing under his own name or the pen names Joe Dalton and Bob McGuire, is a former Green Beret who has a bunch of very good books out there begging to be read. Check them out."
3,Not too hot on details,"I found this book a good read - just like all the other Tom Clancy novels and I have read most of them - but being from Australia I found myself huffing at the lack of accurate detail about Australia and the Olympics. I understand the book was written some time before the Olympics was due to happen and well before the release date of 1999 (obviously) but it wouldn't have been that hard, surely, to find out a little bit of information about Australia's political and police structures before writing it into the book. Bill Henrikson flew from Sydney to Canberra for a meeting which should have taken place in Sydney with the New South Wales police commissioner and authority being granted from New South Wales' Olympics Minister! I enjoyed the book despite the fanatical Americans are the best attitude but the lack of correct detail on Australia - which would have taken five minutes on the phone or the net to get right - was a bit hard to swallow."
2,Poorly Crafted & Edited,"Just finished 'Rainbow Six'. Big book. Big disappointment. I counted probably 17 editing and continuity errors throughout the text. Apparently there are also significant spelling errors, too. I don't expect this is a $30 novel. It almost seems to be a ghost-written. Perhaps Tom is spending too much time developing the computer game versions of his books? Even worse, perhaps he's writing the books with the game in mind(!). Sorry but this is one Clancy novel that is not worth buying. And I'll be reading the next one in my local library."
2,Standard Clancy Stuff,"Tom Clancy has provided yet another tale. Same thing different book. It reads well, but is unsatisfying overall - no new ground is being broken here. His best is still _Red Storm Rising_. His characters are starting to appear similar to those in Ludlum's sequels: older, but still trying to be the original characters they once were. The characters have not evolved. A new set of characters, ones who haven't had a chance yet in Clancy's tired realm, might breathe new life into the world. But he continues to use the same names, the same mannerisms, the same threads. The tale might be better told from the perspective of John Clark's lieutenant, Dingo Chavez, and only from there. We shifted from Ryan to Clark, now let's shift from Clark to someone new. An evolution, shall we say."
2,Tom Clancy has lessened the power of his characters.,It would appear that Mr. Clancy has decided to go the way of Allen Drury as an author. That is to say he is diluting the power of his characters by overwhelming them with far rightwing political plots making his storylines less and less believable.It is no longer fun to read one of his books.My two stars are for the jacket and the font!
3,This is not the Mr. Clark you thought he would be.,"This work is better than the Op-Center works, but still lacks the feel of a Clancy novel when the main character is Jack Ryan."
1,"Please! Clancy Fans, Walk Away From This One!","As a dedicated reader and fan of everything Clancy, it pains me to read the latest adventure of John Clark and Ding Chavez. Not since 'Sum of All Fears' has Clancy woven such a lose and outright boring tale. The story line is only exciting when the newly formed Rainbow counter-terror team deploys for action using the hightech devices at their disposal to to bring down the bad guys. When the story reveals that the true enemy is a bunch of Eco-Terrorists intent on killing the world's population...enough is enough! Tom please!?! Has the world gotten this boring since the demise of the Soviet Block? This dear Clancy fans is a must miss!"
1,lack of suspense,"It is unfortunate that tom clancy has decided to release a new book per year. This pace really decrease the quality of the thing. This last book was too predictable. From the first couple of pages you know that nothing really bad is going to happen to Clark's team so you lose the interest really fast.Reading about a bunch of soldier killing people, even terrorists, did not keep me on the edge of my seat. Clancy wrote great books I hope this one is only an exception"
3,decent- not his best work,"Rainbow Six was entertaining with some good action scenes. However, the plot was too predictable and the book did not contain Mr. Clancy's usual attention to character building as was present in his other novels. It was enjoyable reading. However, I feel that I'd have been better off waiting until the less expensive paperback was available."
2,"Great Effort,Bad Book","What was Clancy on when he wrote this?!I'm not even past the first 100 pages,and already I want to return it!I'm not in to the whole military thing,so half the time I don't even know what the ... he's talking about.I giving him another chance though.I have The Hunt for Red October and The Cardinal of the Kremlin.I'll review them and if they both don't get at least 4 Stars,I'm through with Clancy."
1,"AAAARRRGGHHHH!!!!!! NO more accents, please!","Before you start reading, I'm complaining here about the quality of the audio casette version here.It's...um...awful. I can't bear to listen to any of the attempts at accents, especially the English and Irish ones. And all the women sound like they're propositioning you. All the best lines are cut out, only the Americans sound like human beings.Avoid it."
3,"Bits are good, bits are bad","Personally, having read this book all the way through three times, I've found that the best way to enjoy it is to read whichever bit you feel like at the time. I did enjoy the way it didn't treat the whole world outside of the US as decoration, and it was fun watching Clark, Chavez and the rest of the Americans settling into Britain (although there are one or two mistakes - an overstaffed hospital???).The overall plot I found disappointing - I have visions of Clancy sitting at a desk and thinking 'Now how can I come up with a bigger threat than last time...?' I have to wonder what he'll do for the next book - an alien invasion, perhaps?In short, uneven, and best read all the way through once so you can pick out the bits you want to read again."
5,The best of Tom Clancy,"I have read many Clancy books, including the Net Force , Net Force Explorer and Op-Center series, but Rainbow Six is truly Clancy's best. From the start, you feel like you are pulled in to the story and you just can't stop reading.The book has the highest speed ever, and there just aren't any boring, slow parts of the book.I don't know what to say anymore, except that I recommend this book to everyone."
4,Realistic and Thrilling,I have just finished reading Rainbow Six. It is an excellent book that I couldn't be pulled away from. I knew what was going to happen but it didn't matter. The story still captivated me. I enjoyed the continuation of the characterization of Ding and Clark. I was however dissappointed with Clancy for leaving out Jack Ryan. His name was mentioned only once. This leads me to believe that there will be a blockbuster of a book with all the characters in one final Jack Ryan novel. Also a request that Clancy put in for a movie for some more of his books.
3,"Wonderfully written, but quietly sinister.","Tom Clancy, as usual, has succesfully written yet another wonderfully suspenseful story of adventure,and terrorism. As usual Clancy does a terrific job of introducing his audience to his wonderful variety of characters, and locations. However, the ending reveals things about the nature of his main character, Mr. Clark, that are quietly frightening. I sincerely hope that our government does not solve problems that way in reality. After reading the book, and carefully considering it, I must say that Mr. Clark's solution to the book's main problem, is starkly unconstitutional, something one doesn't expect from Clancy's conservative persuasion. Also, the foul language in the book is both unnecessary, and unrealistic."
2,The terrorists are just too stupid in this book,"*spoiler* The terrorists' master plan is to kill off all humans that are polluting and destroying the earth in order to save the earth. To do this they intend to use a virus to infect and kill everyone except themselves because they have a vaccine that will protect them from it. They test the virus and it works on rats and monkeys and they even test it and find it works on humans. Never mind that some of the biology is wrong, the point is that if it works on rats and humans it's going to kill off a majority of the mammals on the earth - they're trying to save the animals! These are supposed to be smart terrorists with the ability to create a virus but for some reason they don't realize they're about to kill everything they want to save."
2,I was disappointed!,"This book was extremely disappointing. I stopped at the 100th page, hoping for it to get better at page 50 but it didn't. I only gave this book 2 stars because the beginning was suspencful and entertaining. During the first 10 pages I was so pleased and I thought I was into a real adventure, but then it got a little too complex and the action was just plain boring. After reading Tom Clancy's Net Force, Debt of Honor, and Executive Orders, Rainbow Six was just plain. . . BORING! I'm looking forward to reading Patriot Games soon, but after reading Rainbow Six I'm not so sure about Tom Clancy's books, although that'll change soon after reading Patriot Games."
1,damn... sucks!!!,"first of all, i bought this book expecting for the thrills. and theres no lack of thrill obviously. but, this is the story for too machoic and selfish people for other PEOPLEs.main characters lead the story as if they are such a super-man or justice of the peace. they think describing this way is so rightful and powerful(not cool at all ever!!!!).im veryvery disapointed now for buying this, not in rental."
3,Slow paced,"Tighter standards apply to Tom Clancy than to run-of-the mill authors. By Tom Clancy standards, RAINBOW SIX is disappointing. The entire first half of the novel is based on two untenable premises, 1) that a sudden increase in terrorist activities would influence which of many competing companies an Olympics security contract would be awarded to, and 2) that an organization would spend 100 million dollars or so, sponsoring such random terror, when simply undercutting competitor's bids would be more effective. Clancy's writing has achieved a high quality of excellence. Characters are evenly and appropriately developed for an action novel. However, for a Clancy novel, there isn't much action. At times the novel is painfully slow paced. The unnecessary repetition of philosophical an technical points-frequently verbatim, or nearly so-gives the impression of sloppy editing."
4,this book has many good things about it and some bad things,"for all you guys talking about how the rainbow team seems super human well are any of you, navy seals,detla force or secret agents if not then how do you know what people in that life are like."
4,Typical Clancy..He keep you hanging. Then bang it closes!,Great book. Follows his good style. Lots of little strings to follow. Starts to come together late in the second half of the book. A good read. I was 2/3 done and then could not put it down. Clancy is starting to expand his charcter set.. providing different roles and growth for several.
1,"Bad story, bad writing, bad characters.","Did I leave anything out? Don't buy this book. Instead, if you like thrillers, take this recommendation: buy EYES OF THE HAMMER by Bob Mayer in paperback for $3.99 from Amazon. See if you like it. Then if you do, get the rest of his special forces series featuring the same main character; although the rest are only in hardcover, they are well worth it."
1,Does familiarity breed contempt?,"As soon as I saw ""Rainbow Six"" on the bookshelf, I bought it. I never wait for the soft-cover to come out, however, this time I should have. Editorial errors such as a character changing names from ""Tim"" to ""Tom"" in a page shows that speed was the driving factor not quality in this latest Tom Clancy book. Unfortunately, this is not the first time this has happened in a Clancy novel. The plot was generally plausible, but the lack of substance to the characters was most dissapointing. All the ""good"" guys were alike, almost like clones of each other. The book reads like it followed a standard formuala for its construction and so consequently it is highly predictable. The one refreshing departure from past books was that the ""bad"" guys were from the US. I would not recommend you rush out and buy this one, but if you have some time to pass and want something not too challenging, then buy it."
1,Goodbye Jack Clark and Tom Clancy!,"This book is a waste of time featuring ludicrous plots and a plethora of unreal, dumb, ""bad guys"" It becomes obvious immediately that Mr. Clancy has run out of ideas, what is next, Jack Clark and Ding battling aliens or perhaps giant prehistoric creatures?"
2,"Not a thinking book, good for passing time","I forgot it on the train in London after 300 pages. I was inititally upset, but had absolutely no desire to purchase it again. Sorry Tom, but you blew this one. Where is the twisted plot that uses the 150 pages for plot foundation and another 800 to unwind? It read more like a Grisham...not a thinker, just a time passer."
2,Short story; long book; insurance guy playing tough.,"I swore off Clancy after Patriot Games. Too many words, thinly-drawn characters, language out of the '50s movies he grew up on.(I grew up on them, too; does anyone actually use the word ""pal"" anymore?) But I made the mistake of buying this one. It's based on an interesting idea (with one interesting character -- the Russian), but Clancy has no sense of character, so he just writes and writes and pages pile up and nothing happens and you don't really care about anybody. It must be the Stephen King syndrome. The author has become so commercially successful, nobody can edit him.Be warned. This one ain't worth the effort. And if I ever buy another Clancy book, I hope my wife kicks me right in the butt.For much better writing, try LeCarre for espionage and Stephen Hunter for paramilitary."
3,Definitely not Clancy's best....but entertaining.,"Clancy's works have grown steadily less and less ""interesting"". Don't get me wrong...his overall story ideas are usually right on the pulse of current day problems; his action sequences are marvelous; and his grasp on military technologies still remains unsurpassed. But, his latest novels just lack the ""oomph"" of earlier works. For example, R6's ending just kinda dies...slow and unremarkable (although I did appreciate the very last mini-chapter), especially compared to ""Sum of All Fears"" or ""Debt of Honor"". I guess I'm basically indifferent towards this book...entertaining, and I'll recommend it, but not a must-read. I anxiously await Clancy's next...maybe something with submarines again? *crosses fingers*"
5,He has done it Again!,"Just when you thought Clancy has, and others in the Techno-War genre, written every conceivable plot post WWII, a new interesting scenario pops up.Here you have an innocent bio-firm that has infiltrated all levels of the American system, only to deceive us with a sinister plot to change the face of the planet-- literally.Its up to Rainbow, a covert multi-national anti-terrorist team to unravel the many far-fetched but related clues to stop this atrocity. Led by the secretive John Clark, Rainbow scours the political scene, sending his troops to disolve these threats as they happen, before any more innocents get caught in the crossfire.Like all of Clany's works, the situations are highly detailed and descriptive. Many technological wonders are used, as well as luck and detective work on a global scale.The only thing missing from this book was Jack Ryan, and I thought the conclusion was a slightly anti-climatic."
3,A good Listen on the CD ABRIDGED edition!,"According to the reviews of the Hardcover edition of the book, the Abridged Edition on CD was a good choice. I found the story line to be a bit more predictable than other Clancy novels, but enjoyed listening to the story. I'll read the Hardcover because I did miss some of the extra details Mr. Clancy is known for."
2,Read this only if you are really bored.,"I guess no one dares to edit Tom Clancy because this book could have been halved without losing anything. Not that it would have gained anything either. If you want some excitement read an author whose books I found here at Special Forces museum at Fort Bragg-- Bob Mayer. Amazon also carries his titles. Try EYES OF THE HAMMER or DRAGON SIM-13, SYNBAt, CUT OUT or ETERNITY BASE. Great reads and from talking with guys who serve in special forces here, this is the real thing. Mayer was a former Green Beret himself."
2,97 degrees in Sydney in July?,"The book was fine (if you're a Clancy fan), but quite predictable and repetitive. The worst part, though, was the poor research. The Summer Olympics are being held in Sydney in July, and it's 97 degrees? I don't think so. Down under, it's winter, and in Sydney the temperature ranges on average between 46F and 62F degrees (according to my National Geographic atlas). This would eliminate the need for air conditioning and defeat one of the main premises of the book! This book was written way too fast. Clancy should be forced to re-read The Hunt for Red October five times before writing his next book."
3,He doesn't have his old spark,"Tom Clancy has recently been kinda stale, and it shows with his recent books. Those books I would give 1 star, but this book is a bit different. I can still see a touch of Tom Clancy in this book, of the old Tom Clancy that is. His next book should be great if he learns from his mistakes. It's a slow book, but in the end, it's rewarding."
3,readable - but nothing special,This book was disappointing - I have always liked and looked forward to certain author's works - Mr Clancy among them - after reading this I will not be in any hurry to read his next output - My main objection to this book was I felt Clancy was on a soap box too much. Also the action sequences seemed to be the same thing over and over - I can always go back and reread his earlier works - which I have started to do.
2,Not up to this author's previous efforts.,"The cast of characters in this book will be familar to readers of other books by this author. The action in RB6 is good but the goal of the bad guys, who the reader KNOWS will never be reached, is too much to believe. The notion that a large group of people could conspire to pull off such a double bad deed without somebody spilling the beans is way beyond belief."
3,Not his best---but adequate,"I have been a long time fan of Tom's work, but this book has simply left me scratching my head---for the first 250 pages, nothing seemed to be happening, except a very slow setup. After that ""short"" interlude, the book did pick up steam, but following on the same theme of his prior novel, ""Executive Orders"", makes you wonder if Mr. Clancy has run out of ""novel"" ideas. The resulting ending was not as captivating as his priors, and to be honest, a little farfetched, even though this is fiction. Personally, I can hardly wait for his next book---this should give some indication where he is heading."
4,"This book kept me awake on a night, I could not put it down","I found this book a little hard to get into at first (as with other Clancy books), if this is you, persevere, it's worth it. Some of the characters are already well known from other books but even if this is the first Clancy books you've read don't worry, you'll soon get the plot.I got to parts in the book where it became impossible to put down as I became desperate to know the outcome of one of the groups missions, as with any good James Bond film, you know the good guy always win's, however Clancy paints such a vivid picture of the places and characters.In my opinion, an excellent read!"
4,Classic Clancy,"An excellent work by Clancy, this book deserves a spot on every Clancy fan's bookshelf. While some of the book gets jumbled, the rest flows smoothly, combining emotional conflictions and in depth description, topped off with Clancy's immense military and intelligence knowledge. Wonderful book."
2,Tom Clacy at his worst,"I did not like his previous book that focused on John Clark instead of Jack Ryan either. This book is cheesy and very predictable. The character development was weak except for the few main characters. The supporting characters were important enough that they should have been developed further. He has sunk to the level of the rest of the pack of military techno-thriller authors. While this would be an accomplishment for some, his previous books demonstrate that he is a better author."
2,Friendly heroes and idiot villains,"Clancy's books are often uneven, but usually they are strong overall. When this one focuses in on the main plot halfway through, one can't help but notice that the villains are very poorly rendered. They seem like a hodgepodge of misguided keystone cop bad guys. Their logic and actions are so ridiculous that the book falls apart by the end, leaving the reflective reader very disappointed. If only real life terrorists and mad scientists were this incompetent, we could all sleep safely at night."
4,Excellent thriller!!,I thurely enjoyed reading this book! I have only read 2 or 3 of his books but this was defenately a good one!
4,OUTSTANDING,"How does one critque an author in a class by himself? Rainbow Six is not as good as Executive Orders. But it is head, shoulders, and waist above most anything else out there. Uncharacteristic of Clancy this requires more tolerance of his characters. But it is a compelling read... and is really about three books in one story. Outstanding by any measure ... unless you compare it to other Clancy stuff."
2,Stop the cut and paste Tom!,"I used to be a Clancy fan.This has changed with the last few novels. Way too much repetition. Rainbow Six has great action, a vaguely believeable plot (you have to try!) but could easily have been written with half as many trees!I saw another review which commented that descriptions were repeated - this is absolutely my impression as well. Please Tom, if you have described something already, give your readers the benefit of the doubt as to whether they will remember it! Some of the descriptions of plots/ people are word for word the same in multiple places in the book.Having said all that, I was vaguely entertained."
2,The movie for this book will be in black and white.,"""They made me write it,"" or so Tom Clancy would seem to imply. Perhaps he is disinterested with his past style, or maybe this book fulfills a contract. Rainbow Six is analogous to Beethoven played on a Casio toy keyboard -- the talent is hidden somewhere, but the result is too mechanical to be enjoyed. Those who have read his other (very good) stories must, of course, read this superfluously opinionated sermon/novel. A word of caution: be prepared to bulldoze your way through every tedious, exhausting minute of seemingly never-ending verbiage. As a die-hard fan waiting with sweaty palms, this book was most disappointing and irritating.Rainbow Six belongs at the grocery store next to the ""Bran Flakes,"" with a stark white cover displaying in large, black letters only the word ""CLANCY."""
1,This is not Tom Clancy's best work.,"RAINBOW SIX is not a classic Clancy. After reading it, I felt that I had been burned by a new author. The fresh perspective is gone. If you loved the ""OP-CENTER"" novels this is for you. If you expect a quality novel this is not it."
1,Politics has hurt is writing,"Clancy was at his best in Red Storm Rising, Red October, and Clear and Present Danger because his plots were bold but plausible. That's not the case with this book. His notion that a small group of environmentalists would seek to destroy the human population of earth to protect the animals is illogical, impossible, and ludicrous. The conservative Clancy is trying to pose a threat (which doesn't exist) from the ""greens"" to validate his right-wing paranoia. Stick to subs and tanks, Tom."
1,His worst book so far,Little more than a collection of weak action sequences connected by an even weaker plot. Don't buy this one.
4,"Clancy's book always makes me happy, but...","I think Tom must have been looking for a new type of enemy. As Eastern block collapsed, Novelists cannnot depend on the Evil-spy of USSR or so any more. The sinister ecologists in this book is very plausible to me, and like most of Tom's Jack Ryan series, It's very exciting. But I must confess this book is too long to read and...the climax is not so good to me. I always amazed by the imagination of this author, but Tom should make changes a little bit.PS> In Korea, Everybody knows the computer game ""Rainbow Six (and the Eagle Watch)"" but...few knows that the original is this novel..how strange..."
2,Tooo....much reiteration.,"Don't get me wrong, I love Tom Clancy novels but this one had a couple of hundred pages of discribing stuff that everbody knows already, and more than once, instead of developing the story. This could have been a great novel. Sadly it was far below Clancy's best. The only reason I finished it was because it was written by Clancy and I wanted to see how the stars of the story did their thing, IE Clark and the boys. The real star of this story is really Popov"
4,well crafted theme of rain and light,"Clancey's use of instinctive notation registers his reader with facination. An awakening to the now. A plot that hits close to home, he confronts the harsh political reality of our current world community."
3,Not his best effort,"Between trying to buy football teams and promoting games off his books and 'co-writing' numerous other books, Clancy has lost whatever he had at the beginning of his career. As far as those reviewers who think this is the 'real deal' on Special Operations-- not even close. Clancy never carried a ruck, jumped out of a plane in the pitch dark or been shot at. You want realism try BLACKHAWK DOWN, the story of the Rangers in Somalia. Or in fiction, try Bob Mayer's Special Forces books. --This text refers to the"
3,dive dive dive,"I like Tom Clancy's books, I really do. The first few he wrote, including the Jack Ryan series, were an enjoyable read by an author who knew what he was talking about. In Rainbow 6 however, while he still knows what he's talking about (the research is evident), it hasn't got the pure feel of his earlier work, which were based much more closely with experiences and machines he knew about. The book is 300 pages too long, and constantly, and I mean constantly repeats itself. (maybe he bypassed an editor). On the plus side his characters are strong, and none stronger than our old mate John Clark, whose adventures and experiences are as familiar to readers as those of Jack Ryan, and the storyline itself is excellent, if far reaching. i.e. the main bad guys have the biggest mouths and the worst security you could possible imagine, and if troops and their families at Hereford could be attacked that easily I would be very surprised. Take us back to the Navy Tom, to the subs we loved so well."
3,Rainbow six,Clancy spends to much time talking about the philosophical points of situations. The story drags along for a lot of the book.
1,pure garbage,"I haven't read a clancy novel since Patriot Games, now i know why. How many times can we hear the same one dimensional characters mouth or think the same monotonous drivel? This book is plotted at the level of a nintendo game, first mission; handle the hijacking on the plane, second mission; handle the terrorists at the bank; third mission etc... Clancy fails utterly to invoke any depth into his characters. The bad guys (which are referred to as ""bad guys"" about 500 times in this massive pile of crap) are consistently the same self-deceived zealots, time after time, and the good guys after killing the bad guys move into the same self satisfying passages of supposed reflection. His portrayal of environmentalism and environmentalists is a pathetic and transparent attempt to vilify politics and ideology he clearly has no understanding of, merely to serve as the punching bag for his own right-wing longwinded philosophy. I can't believe i read this junk."
1,An Incredible Disappointment,"Clancy has finally done it. After a long and illustrious career of writing techno-thrillers that I have enjoyed, he has finally produced a major snafu. I have been a fan of Clancy's book for the past 16 years and finally decided I have had enough.Clancy's characters are so wooden that they must have carved out while the tree is still standing. His apparent bias on Team 1 success is so blatant such that when the only time Team 2 led by UK based Covington was in action, the team got plastered.The killing of a hostage was glossed over and justified by the team as ""she's going to die anyway"" despite the obvious fact that it was an action prompted by the team's psychologist decision to push the terrorist. How obscene.Clancy obviously needs new material because repetition is getting obvious as you go through the book. I simply couldn't wait to finish so that I could recycle the book and save some trees. A complete waste of time."
2,"Good story ruined by ""magic"" tech","I liked it up until the final confrontation where the team used some completely unrealistic ""magic"" technology to defeat the bad guys without any kind of difficulty. It was rather anti-climactic and destroyed the story."
3,"Lively plot, boring prose","Mr. Clancy's previous two books Debt of Honor and Executive Orders were excellent. This time, however, Mr. Clancy was obviously preoccupied during the writing of this book -- a divorce, an attempt to buy the Minnesota Vikings. This book would have benefited from some serious editing. The 740 page book should, by rights, be about 500 pages long. The excess is constant repetition. If I had to listen one more time to the summary of the bad guys' plan of action, I would have screamed. If I had to hear one more character say one more time that someone has ""been there and done that"" or any of another dozen cliches, I would have puked. Clancy's strength is drawing up an exciting plot. His weakness is trying to present interior monologues from his characters. He should concentrate on the plot and give up the monologues -- they are so boring. As for the plot, he is starting to rehash old ones."
1,Very Disappointing,"To put it simply Tom Clancy latest offering is just plain bad. Rainbox Six is basically an international version of Tom Clancy's Op-Center. The over all plot is totally unbelievable and something that you would expect from a James Bond movie, which one of the main character points out when after discovering the villians plans says ""Who thought this up - Spectre?"". Along with the ridiculous plot the villians in this book have the brains of Willie Coyote in a Warner Brothers cartoon. I am rating this book at 1 star only because I can not rate it any lower. My advice is not to by this book but go back and re-read any of Tom Clancy's previous novels."
2,Tom Clancy's worse book yet.,"Unlike most other Tom Clancy books, this one is not well researched nor well thought out. The plot is almost regurgetated from part of his last book. He is extremely redundant throughout the book - he repeats parts of the plot so many times you cant help but skim though portions of the text. Usually Clancy is dead nut's on technical accuracy. This time however, some of the technical aspects of the book are pure fantasy - ridiculously so. Is it a good book? Well its fair as books go, but its well below par for Tom Clancy."
2,"Ok, but not one of his best","Looks like Clancy and his editors were rushing to get this one out the door. Numerous editing errors (e.g. Clark leaves his house twice (pp. 25/26)). Lots of repetition-how many times do we need to read the same graphic description of someone getting shot in the head or the number of shots that each character fires with their silenced weapons? No real climax, it just withers (meanders) away to a predictable ending after the hospital scene. And what mysterious disappearance at the end of the book? The Gulfstream pilots knew where they were...Tom, we expect better."
3,The World According to Clancy,"Tom Clancy did his usual job of entertaining us with this techno-thriller but his characters are all so perfect,that they do not come across as believable. It seemed that Clancy loves his main characters so much that their aura of invincibility was never seriously threatened- this makes for an uninvolved combat narration because you know that the bad guys are doomed even before the entire sequence is played out. Extremist groups for the environment are a tiny minority and Clancy chooses to put nature conservation ( which should concern us all ) in a very bad light- no doubt reflecting his very narrow minded view of the World according to Clancy."
3,Tom Clancy does Dirk Pitt,Not one of Clancy's best. The plot is like something out of a 60's bond movie and the writing lacks his usual depth. Wait for it to come out in paperback.
3,First 2/3'rds - Clancey; Final 1/3rd Cheesy James Bond,"Great Clancey until end of Amusement Park Episode. After that....well, how frustating is it to watch a top-notch ex-KGB officer, who always does his cultural research, take an incredable amount of time to uncover an eco-terrorism plot? (only explanation: Popov did'nt read or watch enough James Bond during his training). The only thing missing was that Dr. Kilgore was'nt sitting in a stratolounger, viewing multiple blinking lights and petting his cat! Clancy was at his best at describing an e-attack on our financial markets in ""Debt of Honor"" . . . Unfortnately, he cant ""get real"" with this plot. Read it until the amusement park incident is resolved, then put it on the book shelf and wait for TC to re-evaluate his plots and return to greatness. This one's little more than a made-for-TV movie, presented in poorly edited print."
1,Sickenly verbose,"This was my second attempt at reading Clancy and it will be my last. I've read thru boring, repetitive, slow, drawn out submarine chases in ""Hunt for Red October"" awhile back and thought maybe this would be an improvement but no such luck. This book is just a slow and drawn out and wordy. After drudging thru 500 pages the plot finally starts to unfold and makes sense but it's still disjointed. The other pieces unfold after another 100 or so.What's worse is that he's not even a great story teller. He definitely knows his stuff, I give him credit for that, but when it's overdone it becomes banal so how interesting can that be to read. You might as well read an encyclopedia."
1,Abridged. ; ;,"Has anyone been able to find this in unabridged audio, I was about to purchase and realized it was abridged. ; ;"
4,No pot of gold at the end of this rainbow,"I was disappointed in this book. It was too drawn out and too many subplots. Hard to keep all the characters in mind. Actually, if I hadn't read any of Vince Flynn's books, I might have been a little more excited about this book. I have read some other Clancy books and enjoyed them, but this one dragged on."
4,A very good novel.,"This is the first Tom Clancy book i read, and it is very good. There are countless good points about this book. There are so many characters, so many plot twists, and a good variety of aspects of this book. The action parts of the book is probably the best I have ever read. The story is expertly told and you could only guess of what the ending will be."
3,Could have been better - A Review from a Clancy Fan,"NO - The Ultimate Bad Guys leave a lot to be desired - Environmentalists? Pa-lease!NO - Not a lot of characterisation, you have to read most of Clancy's previous novels for that - I recommend 'Without Remorse', 'Clear and Present Danger', 'Sum Of All Fears' and 'Debt of Honor'.NO - you will still enjoy this book even if you haven't read those previous ones.YES - It's FULL of action."
3,"Okay, but not his best","Great read and easy to get into, but the whole concept is kind of hoaky. I like Clancy's stuff and as typical in with his other books the attention to detail is excellent. Overlook the hoaky plot, the book is not a bad read."
3,"Good but, to many long boring parts","The book of Rainbow 6, I do admit, is one of Clancy's best. It is very action packed and always gives gory details. It is perfect for kids. Did I say kids? I meant adults. The book has a whole lot of swearing and a little bit of sex. Like I said this book is very action packed but, it does have some boring parts, like after terriost incidents. Usally you'll have to wait 'bout 150 or more pages of tiny , tiny print. I hope you know I foond my self to little for this book , so don't make a mistake of buying this book for your little ones."
5,Rainbow Six,"This book is absolutely awesome! It is full of heart-beating suspense throughout almost all the nine hundred pages. Two words describe it. ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING! Domingo Chavez is simply darn cool and the terrorists rock, especially Brightling. The plot was great. Don't screw it."
4,Really Good and Entertaining,"I have read a lot of books, but I'll have to say that this is one of the best I've ever read, but there were some minor problems that didn't bother me too much. One of them was the start of the book. It starts out really cool, but then it kinda goes no where for some time. Disjointed plot at times. Once you get further into the book, all the pieces start to fit the puzzle, and the book gets more exciting. I especially thought that the end was great. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes technology, weapons, and espionage all put together. I thought this book was so good (It was my first Tom Clancy book) that I became an instant fan of Mr. Clancy, and I have currently started another one of his books, RED STORM RISING."
2,Too Familiar,"Another drawn out Clancy thriller in which I had to wade through hundreds of pages in search of some thrills. I didn't find many. What's happened to Clancy's inspiration? Everything in this novel is recycled out of better books and movies. For a much better techno-thriller about genetic engineering and biological terrorism, check out Joseph Massucci's Code Alpha."
2,"Good story, poor writing, lousy editing.","Rainbow Six is a good story which is badly written and disastrously edited. The characters, whom we've met in previous Clancy works, are stunted; their dialogue stilted; and their emotions stereotypically trite. The book's cumbersome, redundant prose is peppered throughout with grammatical gaffes.A strong blue pencil might have debulked this book, rendered it more readable, and reduced its price to that of its better-edited peers.All-in-all, this is Tom Clancy's worst offering to date. He gets two stars for the story and none for the storytelling."
1,Rainbow Six best used as a doorstop,"What a McNovel. The same phrases and cliches were repeated several times (why do people complain about the food in England......have you tasted this bread?), the characters never develop, what a shallow piece of trash."
3,"Not his best, but still readable.","I agree with a lot of the reader-reviews I have seen of this book. It does not come close to approaching Clancy's previous books. His characters have all become one dimensional killing machines, very similar to Hollywood's misrepresentations of Jack Ryan and friends. The story meanders and is guessable by the second quarter of the book, Clark and company will ride in to save the day! It is also a weak repackaging of the storyline from Executive Orders, without Jack Ryan.Another thing that bothers me is the editorial style of the book. I counted no less than five spelling errors and a couple of technological mistakes. Another problem is that Clancy will toss out a military acronym and not bother to explain what he is talking about. In earlier books, he very subtly would let the reader know what things were without talking down to them.Lastly, what is with that picture on the jacket cover?"
2,Disappointing,"I am a long time (early) Clancy fan, I read the Navel Institute edition of Red October, before his discovery by the general public. I mention this because Rainbow is not up to Mr. Clancy's standards. Probably 400 pages more than necessary- sorry Tom."
2,Not what you would expect,"Here's a quote. There are some questions in this life that we never can answer properly. Fortunately, the chicken or the egg question about the Rainbow Six game and book that's gone around the block in this space a couple of times in the past couple of days is not one of them, as Red Strom Entertainment's Jeff ""Mad Samoan"" Wand, modeler/artist on Rogue Spear, sends along what's hopefully an authoritative explanation of which is the cart and which is the horse here:The book was based on the game. The original concept for the game was conceived in a brainstorming session with Clancy. The original idea was that it be a 3D first person SWAT game, but Clancy threw in the idea of taking it on a grander scale and giving it an international antiterrorist angle. Some time later after the brainstorming session, he decided it was such a great idea that he'd make a book out of it, tie it in with the game, and maybe someday, a movie. Hopefully starring me."
4,Thrilling novel unfazed by straw men,"I love the novel's gripping plot and heart-stopping counterterror strategies. Despite my love for it, I can't help but feel Clancy putting all his contempts toward environmentalist in writing this book."
2,i'm bored..... (tom clancy) me too! (the reader),"Any review of a new Clancy book must take into consideration his library of prior novels. Even though each new book stands alone, it can not be separated from it's brethren. When reading RB6, I kept getting the feeling that something is wrong here. After finally finishing the book, the problem hit me. Clancy is getting boring. Whereas prior novels kept getting more intense as they went on, RB6 just kept going on and on. It seems as though Clancy himself is the one getting bored with the writing, and we pay the price, (twice!). To test the thought, I re-read the last 350 pages of Debt Of Honor, a recent Clancy full novel. You're interest doesn't wane. After Red Storm Rising, Clancy's focus sharpened considerably, and hopefully he will get back on track with his next major novel."
4,"A good book, but a bit too much repetition.","Well, I read the Dutch translation of this book and I think TC should have written it in about 500 pages or less. I would have rated this book 5 stars if RB6 couldn't save the world. But then TC had to use his fantasy :) After all I liked this book. But the personality's could have been worked out better. O yeah, one last thing: In my opinion TC used a bit too much repetition."
3,"Entertaining, but it might be time to move on..","Rainbow Six is not a bad read. In fact, it's pretty entertaining and had plenty of action to keep the story going. The storyline itself, however, is starting to feel tired. It's not up the standards of the earlier Ryan books and I think the characters in this series have run out of things to do. All the components of this story (terrorist attacks, hostage taking, plagues) have been presented numerous times in other stories. After handling the Cold War, Japan, drug lords, and terrorists, is Clancy's Ryan series getting low on ideas? Another sign that the series is too old is Clancy's constant preaching. He's got to use his own political views as a source of energy to complete this book. I'm looking forward to a new series."
2,This book was a complete bomb.,"Our Writer's Guild decided a few months back to discuss current fiction works by best selling authors. I had the misfortune of selecting Clancy's new book for review. I can't tell you what a let down it was. The characters are weak, redundant, and have too much irrelevant background information. The plot is boring, twisted, and has unresolved issues at the end. I also agree with the reviewer from Denver who read Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture. It's the talk of our fiction group and is a gripping fast read with characters you'll never forget. Try anything by Connelly."
4,My First Clancy Book,"My dad had tried to get me to read Clancy for years. I saw the computer game and decided to try the novel. I am hooked! I am currently working my way through the entire Ryan series. When I heard that this wasn't even his best, I couldn't wait to get the others. I gave it 4 stars because it is not his best, but certainly worth reading."
3,I agree with earlier reviewers-- read someone else,My recommendations after reading quite a few thrillers this year: Bob Mayer's special forces books. Try CUT OUTor DRAGON SIM-13.
1,"A boring, repetitive imitation of Tom Clancy","As a die hard Tom Clancy fan from his first book on, how disappointing it was to discover this re-hash of Clancy standard themes that is mostly fill. I have my doubts if he did all the writing himself -- it smacks of pay-by-word. The plot has absolutely NO credibility and is slightly silly that he would ask us to suspend belief to this degree. Clancy was an embarrassment on the Larry King Live show. He seemed to have absolutely nothing to say -- just like his latest book."
2,They left stuff out.,"Like all of Clancy's books, it's a good read when you don't want to have to use your mind much. I own the hardback, and the Kindle version leaves stuff out, mainly the prologue. What's up with that, Amazon?"
2,Ghost Writer?,"It doesn't seem possible that Tom Clancy wrote this book. The characters have no depth (John Clark and Domingo Chavez don't even resemble the same characters from the Jack Ryan series), the socio-political elements are one-dimensional and the book is filled with jargon and idiomatic expressions that Clancy never uses.I've just finished reading non-stop 5 Clancy books, starting with the ""Bear & the Dragon"", and then reading in order from ""Clear & Present Danger"" through ""Executive Orders"". Each of these books were addictive and provided insights on a wide variety of levels. You could get into the minds of the characters and understand their multi-dimensions.I'm having trouble finishing ""Rainbow Six"" as the characters and plot are so superficial.Hopefully ""Rainbox Six"" was written by a ghost writer!"
2,Tom Clancy almost does it again.,"Rainbow 6 started well enough. The action and pace is typically Clancy, but after that, the book goes downhill. Characters are shallow, and we never feel for John Clark and Ding as we felt for Jack Ryan. The plot is not as believable as Clancy's Ryan novels and the bad guys even less so. As a Clancy fan, I felt a little cheated. From anyone else, this might have been a decent enough book, from Clancy, this is a let down indeed. I keep flipping the pages thinking it will get better, I was wrong."
2,Clancy's new low...,"Nowhere is the decline of Western civilization more evident than in its art, and Mr. Clancy's latest attempt at a thriller is artless indeed. Poorly developed characters, a plot line written with aspirations for the silver screen (and not the page), and Mr. Clancy's nauseating platitudes to the gods of technology make Rainbow Six among his worst in recent memory. If he cannot be persuaded to take early retirement, then perhaps he might recall those early days of red storms rising when the desire to tell a great story superceded the need to placate a great and growing ego."
4,"Good story, good detail, not enough action","I liked this book a lot and I personally believe that Tom Clancy is a great author. This book had it's strong and weak points. On the strong side, the plot and story line were great with much detail throughout the book. On the weaker side, though, the book seemed to have too much time where nothing happened. Just training, more training, and waiting, and more waiting. When action came around, it was superb, but throughout the book it was too sparse. Overall, I liked the book and can't wait for the next Clancy book!"
2,Just OK,"As an avid Tom Clancy fan, I was excited to read his new book, but was very quickly disappointed. His repeated phrases and tired plot of commandos against crazed environmentalists was awful."
3,Not Clancy's best.. but still a good read,"Bottom line: if you like Clancy's previous works, you'll like this one as well. No, it isn't his best work, and yes it is a bit repetitive at times. And I'll leave the realism of the plot to others more technically qualified than I. But as a generally believable and suspenseful work of fiction, Rainbow Six succeeds. A good, if not quite great read. The only question remaining for Clancy fans may be: where can he take the series from here?"
2,Clancy Drops a Bomb,"In the spirit of classic Clancy novels, techno-talk that we all love, action scenes that Spielburg only wishes he could come up with, Rainbow Six is....not among them. Rainbow Six, in my humble opinion, having read all of his works, is his weakest to date. The story lines are elementary, the dialouge is forced, the action scenes, usually superb, are weak and the plot is something that could have been ghost-written by Pieznick or whoever in his bathtub. Clance; what happened, man? All that money boring you? Dulling the brain? Dishearted over the Orioles? You owe it to your loyal fans like myself; who own every one of your books and who are trying hard to not conceed #1 to Stephen Hunter. You're better than this. Don't rest on the laurels. This latest effort is stunningly mediocre."
1,"Overly long, exhaustive, utterly boring and lacks direction.","I have enjoyed all of Clancy's books except Rainbow Six. The plot was confusing, no idea of what the plot was supposed to be until better than halfway through the book. The book lacked direction, had no real character development. The length of the book could have been pared down and would have made for less boring reading. The commitment of the bad guys, their love of nature, was endlessly dribbled in most of the pages of the second half of the book, so that more pages of the book could be filled . The space should have been used for better plot development. Overall, this book was very dissatisfying for a major Clancy novel. I shall hesitate before venturing to purchase the next one. Get an editor and trim down the inconsequential garbage that seems to abound in the stories more and more. I give this book a zero star, even though the rating is one star. Amazon.com doesn't have a zero rating!"
2,The end of an era...,"The end of the cold war has put many people out of work and one of them might just be Tom Clancy. History will record Rainbow Six as the book that caused many Clancy lovers to move on.Although the concept of an international anti-terrorism force has great potential, Clancy squanders the opportunity by taking on a plot that couldn't be handled even by this bloated 900 page effort. After suffering through page after page of dry character and plot develeopment, I was amazed at the lack of pay-off at the end.If you are the weekend paintball type, this book will probably still turn your crank. If you're like me and love Tom Clancy novels for their mix of real drama and high tech narrative, you will be sadly dissappointed."
2,"Shalow, shallow, shallow","Geez, Everytime Clancy writes a new novel it seems things get more and more the same. He seems to take marvelous characters and cut the heart out of them. Then just to top everything off, he appears on the back of cover looking like a fighter jock ready to launch off the Eisenhower. Has he perhaps become a ""wannabe?"""
4,"Good reading, but Rainbow 6 has weaknesses","Good reading, Rainbow Six draws the reader in nicely. However, the plot has some weaknesses, the ending is a bit on the ludicrous side, and Clancy's ""good guys"" seem to be saying that anybody who cares about the environment is a complete nut and to be a ""good guy"", you've got to only want to exploit the environment.Clancy -- you should keep your politics out of your writing. It's a lot more interesting to read when you stick to what you know."
3,"Good read, a lot of political posturing that became tiresome","Not the best from Clancy. Clark and Ding are good characters,I was looking for something like ""Without Remorse"". The bad guys are a little thin. They are too ambitious in their evil plot. How they go about their Project is not too credible. I believe there are some fanatics out there who may dream about doing something similar, but they would not be able to control security as they have in this book. We can't keep governmental secrets in the highest places, as the book shows, what makes eco- terrorists better at security?"
2,Unbelievable!! A so-so Tom Clancy novel!,"It kills me to say this, it really does, but Rainbow Six is a bit of a dud. I am afraid that TC did not have his full attention on this one. The pieces are all there, but they just don't connect in the inimitable Clancy fashion. There is a lack of focus both to machinations of the bad guys, and the heroics of our heroes, the plot meanders hither and yon, and the denouement I found totally completely predictable and therefore boring. Nonetheless, I did little but read it over the course of 2 days, however I fear that Rainbow Six will not be re-read and savored numerous times. If this had been a first effort, straight-to-paperback work from a new novelist, I would be satisfied, as with a Big Mac grabbed on the run.....but it is certainly not the multi-course, gourmet feast I would expect from the latest Tom Clancy yarn."
2,"Shame, Shame","If your a die-hard Clancy fan, go for it, if your not, then skip it. This is just another tired killer virus novel, that has been done much better way too many times. Mr. Clark in ""Without Remorse"" and in the Jack Ryan series was always well done, in this novel he's not done at all. Talk about a let down, I was *very* disappointed... Poor Plot, really bad editing (mispelled words, poor grammer, etc.)Poor Character development, way too long, and an incredible mismanaged climax (finish) and to top it off we have to listen to Clancy's right wing rants and raves throughout the book. So much anticipation, so little satisfaction...."
1,Disappointing to Clancy fans.,"It's interesting to note that most of the 'five-star' reviews below of this book are by people who have not yet finished it. Most of the negative reviews are by people who don't like his politics.I'm someone who loves his politics: I like his patriotism, his sense of justice, his take-no-prisoners concern that the bad guys fry. But Clancy over and over tends to write one really great book followed two years later by one he just ""phones in.""This book doesn't get started until page 490. There is no attempt at characterization of either Clark or Chavez or Popov or anyone else. The terrorist events are repetitious. The combat situations are repetitious. Even the conversations are repeated over and over: Hey, Tom -- it's not groundhog day!Your ""Executive Orders"" only a year ago was a superb, brilliant, powerful, moving book. I was counting the months until this one.What happened, dude?"
2,Another donation to the Tom Clancy retirement fund......,"I really didn't want to be disappointed with this one. Clancy's fame is well earned after penning such winners as Red Storm Rising and The Hunt for Red October. So, setting aside the multitude of grammatical and spelling errors, what's the explanation for the redundant descriptive phrases and shallow dialogue that riddle this story like rounds from an MP-10? Furthermore, I couldn't get past the basic fallacy of the plot, which was that no evil scheme of such cosmic proportions as this one could plausibly escape the notice of the general public. And how about the families of all those Project members? Finally, as if Clark's punishment of the environmentalists wasn't enough, Clancy wastes a good portion of our woodland resources in pages and pages of empty writing which don't provide the readers or the characters with anything useful. If this had been a movie, I would have waited for the VHS version...."
5,Had me on the edge of my seat,Always like Tom Clancy and couldn't put this one down. Plot took a lot of twists and turns and was very scary. Everybody should read this book.
4,An enjoyable adventure read with a very happy ending,"The book is a fantasy about some very wealthy environmentalists who decide the best thing they can do to save the planet is to kill off everybody but themselves. It's good fantasy, and sometimes makes me wish I could be one of them. The story moves along with typical Clancy verve. I don't care much for Tom Clancy, the person, but I do like a couple of his books: this one and ""Red October."""
5,Great Book!!!,What a awsome book. I am a huge Clancy fan and with a few exceptions love all of his works. This is easily one of his best. It has a wonderful plot and lots of action. The pace of the book just never lets up and it is very hard to put down. I suggest this book to any reader who loves books with lots of action. You won't regret buying it!!
5,First class!,This is Tom Clancy at his best.The plot continually develops itself in a logical and compelling way and the descriptions of action are extraordinary for realism and sequence.I truly believe that Tom Clancy has the writer gene in his DNA and he costantly proves this!5 stars!
4,A review of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six,"Rainbow Six by Tom Clancy is an exiting, thrilling book because there is a great deal of action, there are many thrilling fights and brawls, and there are many dangerous situations with bombs, guns, and firearms.One of the dangerous situations was when one of ""the banks glass doors opened and a man in civilian clothes dragged a body onto the sidewalk. It seemed to be a man but his head was a red mess."" A place in the book that had action was when ""they heard a loud metallic crash that shook the whole world."" A good fight was when ""the phisician reacted by dropping away from the gunman behind him with his hands over his head."" In conclusion the book held my attention and was an action packed thrilling book with fights and many dangerous situations. The book also taught me all about terrorist attacks and how they are handled."
2,"No pot of gold at the end of this ""Rainbow""","It seems as though this has been done before. The same ideas, format, novel progression, and hokey idealistic themes are present here that have been in the ""Op-Center"" drivel, only stretched out to 700 pages. The only thing that this book has to offer is Clancy's detailed explaination of some of today's newer gadgetry. In fact, if one were to review some of the earlier novels and compare it to this book, one would have to wonder if Clancy wrote this himself or if he hired a ghost writer to do it for him. If you must read this book because you have been a Clancy fan, like myself, be sure to buy the cheapest paperback that you can find so that your disappointment can be minimized."
5,5 stars all the way,how could you not love this book. This is the perfect book for someone inlove with NSA and DELTA agincies.
3,"""Poetic justice""","As usual, the last 250 pages of this TC book race along, and I must say, what happens to the ""bad guys"" is what a great friend of mine said, poetic justice. BUT, the good guys, they're just too good, no flaws, (real people have flaws). I did enjoy the greedy Russian with a consciense, he was my favorite character of them all, Chavez my least favorite, too bad he didn't get knocked off in Clear And Present Danger. It's worth the read if you can get through the sappy family scenes scattered through out the book. My least favorite of his books is Clear And Present Danger, the best two, Sum Of All Fears and Without Remorse."
3,Not Clancy's Best Work,"Information overload fills the pages of this novel that never really seems to get on track. When it clicks, there are some enjoyable moments, but those moments are spread out."
2,Rainbow Sox,"Since I got access to Tom Clancy's books back in 1992, I have been a big fan of his books and tried to read all new ones. While the general plot of the book is very good (as usual with Tom Clancy) it seems that he became too assured of his success and he does not pay attention to details that make the good fiction book. I did not like that there were so many places in the book where Tom Clancy repeats his lines over and over. It also appears that Clancy was tired by the end of his book and tried to finish it as soon as possible making the book crippled at the end. One more comment (that is just one more example of his failure to pay attention to the details) - all references to Russian words in the book do not make any sense (it looks like Tom Clancy just opened a bad English-Russian dictionary for pre-school and took the Russia words from there)."
2,Definitely below par for the course,"As an avid Tom Clancy fan, having read all of his Jack Ryan novels as well as his previous John Clark story, I was excited about reading his new book. But unfortunately, I finished it with a bitter taste in my mouth. The story, while well researched as always, and including all the technical detail Clancy novels are known for, was just too far-fetched. While one could easily imagine his other stories as really happening in the real world, this was just too much to grasp. The majority of the characters were very two-dimensional, leaving you wanting for more insight. Not to say that there weren't good parts...the terrorist takedowns were very exciting, and Popov's role was intriguing, but it didn't make up for the glaring weaknesses elsewhere...and the ending was very frivolous, with the superhuman team armed with everything going against people with next to nothing...he could have done it much better. Overall, quite disappointing."
4,clancy still has it,I was quite happy with Clancy's work on 'Rainbow Six'. The book had continuous action and Clancy is famous for keeping the stamina high.
3,Not his best effort,I graciously give Tom Clancy 3 stars for this effort only because he is Tom Clancy. This particular effort lacks his authenticity and believablitity so apparent in his other works. The story line has crisis after crisis always ending with the good guys killing the bad guys leaving the white hats with nary a scratch on them. Only one episode leaves any of our good guys with a hair on their head harmed. Mr. Clancy does his homework and usually packs a devastating punch with his reality and authenticity. I was disappointed with his work but still call him the master. I look forward to his next effort.
5,Rainbox Six,"I am puzzled by the lower reviews of this book. I rate it among his best, though never topping my favorite, ""Without Remorse"". This World could use a ""Rainbox Six""!"
2,Not Clancy's Best,"While I love everything else Clancy has written, this book was a disappointment. The same Clancy technical knowledge is there, but the plot leaves you wanting more. It starts great, but by the end it becomes a bad spy novel of world domination. Read Jon Land if you are into that, otherwise go back to Clancy's other proven winners."
1,A big disappointment,"This is by far the worst of Tom Clancy's books. The story line is predictable, the characters are all one dimensional, and it is boring. Mr. Clancy had several opportunites to explore the contradictions in the ""good guys"" that kill for a living and the bad guys that want to kill everyone to restore earth to a ""pristine"" condition, but he never took them. His bad guys are just plain unbelievable. Even the most extreme environmentalist would believe that a small colony of 5000 people would survive without support from a much larger group. Where are they going to get their fuel? How about supplies for their research? Electricity? Spare Parts? The bad guys act like these things will magically appear. Totally unbelievable. One of the main tasks of an author is cause us to suspend our disbelief in favor of the story. Mr. Clancy failed miserably. If you are not a die hard Clancy fan, avoid this stink-a-roo at all costs."
2,Wish I Had Read The Warnings,"Only after reading Rainbow Six did I look up the reviews. I must agree with what seems to be the majority opinion...Clancy's worst to date.I was annoyed by the repeated phrases, the unnatural inclusion of technical information, and what seemed like a lot of filler."
2,"bad research, no plot, good writting","A Clancy as some of his readers want him. I am personally absolutly dissapointed. The writting is as usually good. But first the plot is thin. He could have shortend the book to 100 pages. The worst is the research. For example two out of three german words were misspelled. In school you would get an F- for that kind of spelling. Second Mr. Clancy interpretation of terrorists is laughable. Please Mr. Clancy do us all a favour, try harder next time. I might buy you again. A fan"
2,Read something else--,"Long, slow and not very interesting. I took the recommendation of other readers and also bought Joe Dalton's latest THE OMEGA MISSILE-- much better. Recommend you do the same."
1,"""It's like something from a bad movie.""","Uggh, I never thought a Tom Clancy book would be so bad. A recycled plot line is only made worse in it's second try.One of the characters sums it up best when he learns of the sinister environmentalist plot against the world ""It's like something from a bad movie."" Come on, Tom! Give us a break"
4,A timely tale that should cause every American to think.,"I have to admit that I am a Clancy fan. I have read every book he has written, my favorite being Executive Orders. Rainbow Six took a while to grab me but it did grab me. Clancy has a knack for capturing the real ""clear and present danger"". The plot in Rainbow Six could have just come off of CNN or Fox News.It's a good read and I highly recommend it.Al Lachner"
2,Rainbow Six: Clancy's worst book to date...,"I was extremely disappointed with Tom Clancy's latest work. It falls short in all areas where he is normally praised.The dialogue in the book is poorly written. He frequently uses all the names a character has in one brief discussion. After the second or third time it became simply boring to read everyones name.The level of detail used in R6 is very substandard. Clancy only mildly describes weapons, scenarios and tactics. High intensity encounters are normally over in a few paragraphs.I can see a reason for this though. In real life these encounters would be over in a matter of seconds, in the best case. It seems awkward from a normally thorough writer.I also found the plot to be very predictable. Normally you get a general feel for what is going to happen and then are suprised at what takes place. Not in this book.Two stars may be generous."
1,This is one star too many,"Being an avid Clancy fan, I was looking forward to this newest effort. Liner notes sounded cool. I thought, ""Clancy ought to be able to put together a killer with this plot.""Well, it was a killer all right. This is by far the worst novel Mr. Clancy has written. Now, with a writer of his caliber, this would normally mean that it was still better than most books out there. However, in this case, it doesn't. If fact, I can't remember a more awful novel I have read voluntarily.The characters, usually a strong point for Clancy, are complete cardboard cutouts. The plot is inane. And the ending is anti-climatic to be generous.Save the cash and borrow the book. You may need to read it only for reference later on when a conscious Tom Clancy writes another good book."
1,Clancy has lost his touch,"Clancy has lost his magic with Rainbow Six. It just plods along with limited thrill. It's a long read with no climax; it just runs out of gas. And why are there typos? Tom, go back to your roots and write more like Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising. That's where your magic is."
2,More of the same -- just like all his other novels,"Come on, what does Clancy do -- take his other books, put them in a blender, mix up the parts and pour out a new book. Wives getting kidnapped, IRA terrorists, Russian spies, tough husbands, wives involved in the medical profession, etc., etc. Haven't we read this same book about a half dozen other times -- all of them with Tom Clancy's name on the cover. Nearly every character in the book repeatedly utters Tom Clancy's favorite 4-letter vulgarity. And, of course, the dozens of graphic descriptions of bullets entering (and exiting) villan's heads add a charming touch to the book. If you can stomach all of this and then manage not to get bogged down in the huge loopholes, unsympathetic characters and implausible sequences of events, you just might have a fine read ahead of you."
2,Don't waste your time on this.,"I like Clancy's earlier books but I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote this. One dimensional characters, a predictable plot-- hey the good guys always win!-- and way too long. You want good action, check out Joe Dalton's THE OMEGA MISSILE, Bob Mayer's CUT OUT or DRAGON SIM-13, or Bob McGuire's THE GATE."
2,One of his worst to date.,"Clancy obviously has different constraints nowadays like publishers to satisfy, etc. As a result he is having to move with the times especially with the end of the Cold War being witnessed. His usual attention to detail is obviously missing. Some may argue why worry about such trivialities (e.g. the VC.20B that Clark and Chavez use to fly from Canada to the U.K. is not a Gulfstream 4 but a G3!. In the U.K. we talk about a draw in Football - Soccer, not ties!) but things like this should be easily verified and was the thing that won him many fans in the first place. This is a good book and easy to read but when compared to the very high standards that he set early on this one falls well short. It will appeal to the masses who aren't quite so discriminating."
2,Bloated thriller by out-of-form author,"Anyone expecting the quality of ""Hunt for Red October"" in ""Rainbow Six"" will be sorely disappointed. This book is repetitive, illogical and poorly researched. For example - the Sydney Olympics will be held next August while it's winter in Australia. Clancy's plot however, is built on the premise that it'll be so hot during the Olympics that an extensive cooling system will be relied on to help spectators and competitors cope with the 90 degree+ heat. His characters are also uniformly 2-dimensional - see how action man grandad John Clarke's repeatedly bemoans his role as a desk jockey while his macho Spanish son-in-law's (Ding!?) most gruelling experience seems to be a flight from England to Australia - my seventy year old mother complains less than this anti-terrorist superman ... And there is not a scrap of humour on any of the 800 odd pages (not intentional, anyway). Don't waste your time or money."
3,This is entertainment but don't mistake it for reality,"Clancy can be fun to read, but remember the guy was an insurance salesman, not a grunt, a SEAL, a Green Beret, Delta Force, etc. etc. He can shoot all the guns he wants in the range in his basement but until he steps off the tailgate of a MC-130 Combat Talon he's still a wanna-be. You want authors who've been there, did it, done it and got the t-shirt-- try Stephen Coonts, Harold Coyle, Bob Mayer, Andy McNabb, Joe Dalton, or Dick Marcinko. Just read CUT OUT about an SF guy based here at Bragg and it was good."
2,Worst in the series,"This one was a big disappointment. Missing are the believable military-political scenarios that characterized Clancy's earlier works; in their place, the author inserts a storyline that moves the book from the techno-thriller genre he pioneered into the realm of B-movie sci-fi. The ending takes the right-wing preaching that began to assert itself in _Executive Orders_ to a new zenith."
5,A very well put together book.,"This may sound wierd, but I played the game Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear which then motivated me to read this book. But I must admit, the book is more exciting than the game itself.What I admire most about this book is the way Clancy placed the character. How he describe each one. So it sort of displays a mini-biography of each character. Some the character's features aren't even related to their jobs. So I wouldn't say there is an EXACT main character. Each part of the story seem to tell a lot about them. Some humor, some action, and some tragic. This book was long enough to satisfiy this story. There was only one small thing that I didn't like (which doesn't really matter but I'll say anyways) is how he put a certian part of the story somewhere in the beginning, and let it out at the end. Sometimes I had to reread a part in order for it to make since.Overall, I recommend this book to anyone which will not be offended by certian words."
3,Eh...,"This book was fairly good up until the ending. For about 600+ pages Clancy builds up a suspenseful plot about bioterrorism while keeping the reader entertained by including several anti-terrorist missions that the Rainbow team goes on. However, the ending is hugely dissapointing as it is a major anti-climax riddled with cop-out coincidences (which are becoming more common with Clancy) and shear stupidity. What could have been a great book was ruined by this.The computer games based on this book are fun however."
1,Starts bad and gets worse,"All the stereotypes are here: the big men with their big guns, the crazed terrorists with their slightly smaller guns and for good measure he throws in a bunch of mad enviromentalists ready to wipe out the entire population of the earth. It's clear that Clancy stopped doing research for his books years ago (his lack of knowlege is pretty glaring - he obviously doesn't know the difference between the Provos and the INLA) and this book proves that he could no longer bother to think up a plot either. The book is little more that a set of predictable action sequences strung together on the back of an absurd story which, thankfully, is little more than filler.If you enjoy a good thriller, read one of the masters like Forsyth or le Carrier. If you enjoy books written by a computer program, read Tom Clancy."
3,Is it me?,"or Executive Orders and Rainbow Six are almost the same? I mean, if you substitute Jack Ryan with John Kelly, add or substract a plot or two, it boils down to almost the same thing. Or it's me? I gave this book three stars - one for the effort, one for the lenght and one for the weight, as TC seems to be producing door-stoppers. Maybe he's paid by weight? Word count? He ain't getting paid for the plot, that's for sure.I think TC should take a deep breath and think long and hard whether he wants to write another monster (Executive Orders, Rainbow Six, The Bear and the Dragon). I love books, I love to read, I can read almost anything and I don't mind reading good books twice, but boy, I'm really not sure I want to add another TC to my book collection."
2,Give me a Break,"Although I've read everything but those op-center books, the declining quality of his latest offerings caused me to buy Rainbow 6 with some trepidation. I now regret buying and reading this ridiculous book. There is no reason for this lightweight story to occupy 740 pages -- is Clancy getting paid by the word? Clancy should place more emphasis on tight plotting and omit the right wing paranoia. Also, subtlety is definitely not his strong suit. The ham-fisted superhero treatment of Clark, Chavez, and the rest of the Rainbow 6 team is straight out of a comic book. Finally, I won't spoil it by telling you who the villains are, but if you find them as scary as Clancy does, you are part of the lunatic fringe. What happened to the guy who wrote The Hunt for Red October?"
1,Where has John Clark gone ??,"What a disappointment! For the first time Mr Clancy has filled his novel with cardboard characters and a turgid story. John Clark is portrayed as a bumbling and shortsighted leader whose constant shortcomings are highlighted by the intelligence and abilities of 'Super' Ding. Where has the John Clark from Without Remorse gone. Even Jack Ryan seems to be an incompetent president. It is left to Mr Clancy's newest hero, Ding to almost singlehandedly save the world.Normally I read Mr Clancy's books in one sitting - this one I had great difficulty even finishing.Please Mr Clancy revert to your old writing style, save your political philosphies for your non-fiction works"
2,wake me when it's over,"I've read all of his books and let's just this one just hasn't grabbed me just yet. Unfortunately I dropped the book and damaged the corner so I ""have to keep it"". Otherwise I would have returned it. What struck me as funny is the fact that both John and Ding are so happily married and that both have kids (or kids on the way). Very non-realistic. I've met a few Spec Ops people in my day and none of them are happily married if married at all. I know I'm nit picking but every single one of his characters are ""the best of the best"". The story is kind of like watching one of those PrimeTime movies that the big channels puts on during re-run season. I guess if you can't find another book to read and you do like his style then you might as well pick it up. But don't buy the hardcover...wait for the paperback."
3,Clancy for the first time creates shallow characters.,"Compared to most contemporary novels, Clancy is still great! Accurate technical knowledge is a prime concern to me as a reader, and Clancy comes through. In his past novels the character development and actions are also accurate - they act in accord with their position and portrayed intelligence. In Rainbow Six however, main characters seem blind to obvious flaws in their planning. It it too far a stretch to believe that there are that many people who could keep such a project secret, let alone agree to carry it out in the first place."
1,"Rainbows End, Not!","I think Mr Clancy has given in to pressure to produce or he had a ghost writer do this book from an outline. All my favorite characters were present but the book lacked his normal attention to detail and the story seemed to be aimless and not sure where it was trying to go. the bad guys were presented as a bunch of misguided militant vegetarians, (Vegans) and environmentalists who couldnt see the forest for the trees, the thought of killing every man woman and child on earth to advance the causes of enviromentalism and animal rights was just a little to much to swallow. I wish Mr Clancy would back up and re-group and write a story about Mr Clark during his hey day at the CIA. If you have a 10 hour flight and this book is all you have to read, then go for it. It will be better than staring at the walls!"
5,Intense,"Clancy really keeps you going on this one. Like inside Delta Force, this book takes you inside how these teams work and the stress they are under. Keep them coming."
5,Tom Clancy is the man!!!!!,This book was awsome. It has lots of action. The only real bad part about it was the that the story ended.
3,"Not a literary masterpiece, and not a very good thriller","I don't expect great literature when I read a thriller. I want good action, a smart plot, and some realistic characters. 0 for 3 in this book. Lots of action but since the good guys will always win there is no suspense. I recommend Bob Mayer's Special Forces series of books for those who want to read some excellent military thrillers. A friend of mine, retired from the CIA, told me Mayer's books are among the most realistic he's read about covert military special operations."
2,Way off Clancy's peak.,"Rainbow Six was disappointing. On the positive side, the characters are familiar and comfortable. However, they've become so familiar, you know almost exactly what they will say before they say it. The villians were cardboard figures with no depth. I'll still read his next book. When he's on, he's great. {note: Editing was sloppy.}"
1,"If you want to remain of fan, don't even start this one.",Clancy must have been paid by the word for this book. Redundancies abound! Not to mention the plot was neither original nor were the charaters believable. I think I'll give up my rule of 30 yrs. to finishing one book before I start another.
1,Redundant and too long with a poor ending,"I was very disappointed and unfortuately wasted valuable time reading 740 pages that I would not suggest anyone else to repeat my error. Nice idea for the plot but it was too predictable. It seemed that the editor or Clancy had to wrap things up in one final chapter after writing and building the plot in over 700 pages... what a waste, and I was a Clancy fan!"
3,Disappointing,"Admittedly, I have been a Clancy fan since 'Red Storm Rising', and I was waiting with great anticipation for 'Rainbow Six'. However, I was quite disappointed with it. Upon reflection, I would have expected Clancy to cover more of the nuts and bolts of Counter-Terrorism (CT) Operations and the global approach towards Anti- and Counter-Terrorism, as he did for nuclear science in 'The Sum of All Fears', international finances in 'Debt of Honor', et cetera. It seems like Clancy did not put his renown effort and attention to detail into this book; as if he were checking the block, keeping the mill running just for the sake of keeping it running. Only if one were a true, incurable Clancy fan would I recommend this book but only for killing time on a flight. Otherwise, you would probably receive more entertainment value from Clancy's 'OpCenter' series."
2,It's the Contractual Obligations book!,"I've been a Clancy Fan since Hunt hit paperback. My copies of Hunt, Red Storm and Patriot all fell apart from over-reading. All the other hard covers are on my shelf.That established, this book was mediocre at best. Most of the positive reviews seem to be from people who read Op-Center or this is their first Clancy. It really is like someone else took his notes and wrote it for him. The plot just isn't there and the character are weak. TC is capable of so much more. I may wait <gasp> for the next book to come out in paperback."
2,Shoddy Research,"While I admit that Clancy has written another page-turner, as a German speaker I deplore his obviously shoddy research. Virtually every reference to Germany and German (of which the book abounds) is false or erroneous; he obviously neglected to take the elementary precaution of having a native speaker at least correct his spelling of words like ""Schreklichkeit"" (correct: ""Schrecklichkeit"") or ""Burger Fuhrer"" (""Bergführer"" - his version sounds like something sold by McDonald's. This lack of writers' craftmanship may not distract from the power of the story, but it does induce skepticism towards other details of the book."
2,"Pap, Clancy has done much better..","Clancy is a great technical writer, his prose flows pretty smoothly and he's great in the way he paints with words. It's just his premises are getting more and more flawed. The idea of the real villains all being addicted NPR and Dicovery Channel nature shows just made me shudder. His good guys seem more and more psychopathic as time goes on. In most of his previous books, you could relate to his characters in a positive way, The ""good guys"" in Rainbow are 2 dimensional murderous thugs who would give my id nightmares. So much of the plot gets strung together by happenstance because good police work is precluded by killing all the bad guys (even when it is not neccesary, even contrary to mission objectives, like in the park).Of course the villains will come back in the sequel, look closely at the final chapter to find the hook.Oh well, Tom's run had to end someday..<sigh>Mike"
2,"Repetitious, too long and meandering, and technically wrong","I usually enjoy reading Clancy's novels, but this must be his worst. I tried to finish the book, but it took me almost three months. The story is highly repetitious, with similar incidents throughout the first half of the book. The prose was too verbose. The book could have been half the length and would have been better. Worse yet, Clancy was offbase in his over-eagerness to introduce new technologies, and promoted the DKL Lifeguard (supposedly a human presence detector), which was proven in a later Department of Justice double-blind study to perform no better than random chance, and upon a physical engineering dissection by Sandia National Lab, found to contain a block of plastic with a human hair in it as the active sensing element! Shame to Mr. Clancy for falling for that. One would have thought that someone who had been exposed to so much hi-tech through all his research would have had better sense."
2,"Great Story but tedious, repetitive, and trite dialog",I liked it as I do most of Tom Clancy's books. The story is spellbinding. I thought the dialog was repetitive. Characters made statements and 20 pages later the same thing was repeated verbatim. I think Mr. Clancy was either trying to make the book thick or needs a new editor.
4,very good from one of the greats,"I just finished Rainbow Six and my wife is greatful. Most of the book is the intricate, high-tech, cerebral thriller one expects of Clancy. The ending, however, fizzles somewhat despite the nice twist on the last 2 pages."
2,very predictable,"If this is the first book of Clancy that you are about to read, pick another one. This is the worst book he has written. The book has about 300 to 400 pages more that it should. Most of Clancey's books have enough exiting and intriguing areas to outweigh the slow areas, but not this time. I had to be very determined to finish this book."
2,Very Disappointed w/Latest Clancy Work,"I have read every one of Clancy's novels up until now. However, Rainbow Six and Executive Orders were mediocre at best. I sense that Tom may not have any more good ideas to use now that the Soviet Union is gone and he has taken his other hero Jack Ryan all the way to the White House. As for John Clark, well I think Clancy should have stopped at Without Remorse."
1,Do yourself a favor and don't read this.,"All the things that made Red October and Red Storm Rising great are missing here (feasability of the plot, attention to detail, exploring new areas). How long can an author get by on his past accomplishments ?Tom Clancy has become interested only in becoming a revenue machine, putting his name in a series of products of very debious quality. This is sad comming from a man who's main character stopped trading in stocks because he become bored with making money and wanted to do something meaningful with his life."
2,A mixed and confused bag,"Tom Clancy is at his best when describing military weapons systems and tactics. He does less well with his human characters who seem real enough during their missions, but become two dimensional when the action stops. The magic of a good book is that the characters come to life. Unfortunately, in Rainbow Six they never really do, and so I never really cared what happened to them. More disturbing is the amoral tone of the book. Tom Clancy takes the position that counter-terrorism teams have to crossover to the dark side in the service of the good. This seemed supportable until the final mission where I felt the ""good guys"" lost their humanity. If you give up the moral high ground and sink to the level of terrorists are you really any better then they are?"
3,I agree with Al Gore on this one...,"I also haven't read the book. BUT, I have played the video game. Not too shaby. Not a Q2, but not a bomb either."
1,Boring,Extremely boring... The first Clancy book that was not a constant page turner for me. What happened Tom?
2,Disappointing,"Let's start with a disclaimer - I am a huge Clancy fan. Debt of Honor was one of the best books I've ever read. I thought Cardinal of the Kremlin was the best espionage novel I'd ever seen.So, here's the new Clancy novel. It's huge, but that only makes me anticipate it more. More thrills, more great technology, etc.After finishing it, all I can say is - what a disappointment. The Prolouge is vintage Clancy - greatness! From there, it gets progressively slower and more implausible. The bad guys never seemed as horrifying as I think Mr. Clancy intended. The good guys are a little too super-human. And the last 150 pages made me feel completely ripped off. I could not believe the magnitude of Clancy's cop-out.Previous Clancy misfires (most notably, Sum of All Fears) were still pretty good, just not up to the usual Clancy standard. Rainbow Six is just bad. Please, Tom, take a few years off and come back with stories that live up to your earlier great works!"
5,Tom Clancy hits the jackpot again . . . and again . . . and,"Once again, Tom Clancy has outdone himself. In a brilliant novel, he successfully portrays a well thought through plot. Featuring excellent character development and a flair for writing that only Clancy can portray, I highly recommend this book to any and all."
2,Lack of something better to write about I guess,"I've read better Clancy. He needs to take some time off, find a suitable enemy, and come up with a realistic plot. R-6 was almost impossible for me to get through. I don't plan on buying any more Clancy novels on blind faith."
4,A New Phase?,"It was going to be interesting to see how Mr Clancy could write a 740 page novel set in the Jack Ryan world but not utter his name once. It was only natural that this story was to be about Clark and Chavez. He could not develop the Ryan character anymore and it would have been a shame to end it all with great characters like Clark, waiting in the wings.The story has a bit of every one of his other novels in it. The covert Russians like his earlier novels. The Irish like Patriot Games. The trip to South America like Clear and Present Danger. The middle America setting like The Sum of all Fears and the Bio Warfare like his last book.However what makes it great is the whole Op-Center feel to it. When I first read Op-Center, I felt what a waste of a good idea that is on characters you don't really feel for. But a similar idea has now been developed in the Jack Ryan world, hopefully starting a new chapter in the techno thriller.Hopefully he writes more about Australia!!"
2,What big authors don't need editors?,"Rainbow Six is about...400 pages too long. There are about 300 pages of good Clancy here, but someone has to tell him when he's repeating himself. I can only handle so much description of training exercises. Yes, Tom, I get it, these guys are really well trained, now can you get on with the story!I started skimming this sucker at page 280 or so; and that's never a good sign. I would have quit reading it completely, but I kept hoping something good would show up; and it did occassionally. I give it two stars just so that I'm not lumped in with the reviewers who just wanted to trash Clancy's political views, but this books is probably more of a one and a half star effort."
2,Implausible pulp.,"Previous TC books (not including his various Op-Center type ""franchises"") have required at least some massaging to yield a feature film of varying quality. Rainbow Six is a prefab script, ready to be filmed as soon as the money appears. John Clark's mention of SPECTRE (the evil organization in some of the more dubious James Bond films) was less self-effacing humor than a recognition of what he has decended to: a pulp fiction writer."
3,"Heavy going, couldn't finish it. Like my action leaner.","-- and more realistic. The bad guys are just bad. The good guys are just good and they are judge, jury and executioner. Not my idea of good guys in America. As someone else said, read WEB Griffin for some good stories. Or Bob Mayer, Joe Dalton. Stephen Coonts."
2,Too formulaic and predictable,"This book is too much like the Op-Center series: It's an easy read and fairly entertaining, but it lacks imagination, intrigue, or any great characters.Rainbow Six revisits many characters from the early Clancy novels, centering on John Clark and Domingo Chavez. While they were undeveloped in the earlier Clancy novels, they remain so here even though they are the main characters. Rainbow Six is an antiterrorism team led by Clark, which could be interesting as it takes a military operation into an urban setting. However, as the team emerges from all encounters victorious, it's boring.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone that is a Tom Clancy fan. If Op-Center is your bag of tricks, you may enjoy this novel."
1,Rainbow Too Bad,Too long. Too little action. Too many wasted words preaching Clancy's views. Too boring.
3,"Classic Clancy, but clearly missing cold war clarity","Once again a classic Clancy novel, with all the usual ingredients that make him a popular author.However I am a little dissapointed in this his latest thriller since I think that Tom struggled with a credible plot.I frankly find the premise of the ""back to the caves"" zealot plotting the destruction of humanity a bit of a stretch, and the ending is LAME!!!...I harken back to the days of ""The Hunt for Red October"" and my personal favorite, ""Red Storm Rising"" for exemplarly Clancy tales ...Tom, if you are reading this, forget present, concentrate on the past."
2,Give up the ghost on Clancy-- try other thriller writers,"With this overly long book, Tom Clancy is opening the door for other thriller writers to gain the prominence they deserve. I personally prefer to read writers who have some background in what they write about, not those who invent everything."
3,Not up to Clancy's normal standards. Contrived.,"As an avid Clancy reader I could not wait to read Rainbow Six. How could Mr. Clark was grow old with grace? But right from the start the story line seemed contrived. Clark and Domingo break up a airplane high-jacking while traveling to England with the intent to train a force for quick response to terrorist activities, really! Later when hot on the trail of a Professional Spy (from the old school) they are able to catch him when a janitor in an airport finds a wallet the spy discards with credit cards intact, credit cards that where used in a terrorist act!I was disappointed. Looks like Clancy's hurried this one to print."
2,Tom has produced finer works in the past.,"Tom Clancy has always been known for his accurate information when writing a novel. I think in this instance he should fire his research assistant. Hereford was never visited during the writing of this novel, or so it seemed to me. I lived in Hereford for 3 years while serving with the Royal Air Force, where did he land the C130 ?? Apart from that, the storyline was average."
2,Without the usual breathtaking tension..,"I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed in this book and in Tom Clancy (I've read them all). It seems that he starting to repeat himself, and the story is VERY predictable. One of the things I really used to like about a Tom Cancy novel was that the story was always hard to figure out, and Mr Clancy always liked to stretch the reader's fantasy and imagination. I really hope that the next one will be better, otherwise I will have to look somewhere else (maybe he should concentrate less on the games, and prepare the novels more???)"
1,Dull and without much merit,"Well, he's nuked a football stadium, biowarred the United States, fought desert storm II, put japan back to warring against us and it is no wonder this book fails miserably - what can he do for an encore? Well, he tries to drag us into a biowar two theme, but it just doesnt fly. Evil enviromentalists plot for 10 years to kill everyone but themselves to save the world - it just didnt generate any excitement.It would have been far better had he just let the Rainbow operation work its way through it's missions and left out the end of the world stuff."
2,Pretty poor,"Tom Clancy was once my favorite author (Red Storm Rising is one of the best novels I've read). I have all his books.But ... I read this book for the military bits and the action sequences and actually skipped over much of the dialogue. Jack Ryan, John Clark and Ding Chavez are all mirror images of each other. They all think, talk and act the same. Clancy has a shocking lack of ability to create anything other than 1 dimensional, wooden leading characters. Popov was the only interesting guy.I ended up hoping that the bio-terrorists WOULD succeed. That would have been much more fun.Final point: why does every British character have to say 'Quite' or 'Quite so' in every conversation???I'll keep buying the books, but I'll be treating them more as magazine articles than novels. And I thought I saw light at the end of the tunnel when I read Exectuive Orders.By the way, I echo other comments about reading 'Blackhawk Down' - excellent."
3,Not his best effort,"Between trying to buy football teams and promoting games off his books and 'co-writing' numerous other books, Clancy has lost whatever he had at the beginning of his career. As far as those reviewers who think this is the 'real deal' on Special Operations-- not even close. Clancy never carried a ruck, jumped out of a plane in the pitch dark or been shot at. You want realism try BLACKHAWK DOWN, the story of the Rangers in Somalia. Or in fiction, try Bob Mayer's Special Forces books."
3,Not his best,"I don't know if Clancy is burning out or if it's because I read Rainbow Six after enjoying competing war novel thrillers like War of the Rats and The Triumph and the Glory, but this new one from Tom falls far short of his best work. I hope the next one is better because I know I am not alone in being disappointed with his lackluster recent efforts."
1,Disgusting!Why did Clancy write a book so below his standard,This book was way too gory and had no suspense at all. I didn't feel it was up to Clancy's usual standards.
5,extremely good didn't put it don't till it was done,i really liked this book. I loved the first john clark book Without Remorse and another book that has him as a main character has got to be good. I like this book a little better because in it Clancy starts of the action almost immediatly while in some of his other books it started off a little slow. overall i just really like this book alot
2,"If you like gore and madmen and no plot, get this.","Clancy's latest offering is yet another decline from his high level of excellence in the eighties. Hunt for Red October, Cardinal in the Kremlin and other similar works were well researched, had well developed characters and a pace of plot development that kept things moving and exciting. Rainbow Six depends more on heads being turned into pink meat than anything else to sustain interest. It also suffers from the drag it out write as many words as you possibly can to get your point across for absolutely no reason syndrome. This is one to avoid unless you are truly an avid fan or desperately need some beach reading."
5,A very detailed book.,"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six goes into the detail of all the terrorist plans. He doesn't leave out any minor things that could affect a mission, yet he pulls it off to make the good guys win again. I highly recommend this book."
2,Good plot but too obvious from the start and repetitive,"This is probably one of Clancy's worst novels. The plot is good but it is completely given away far too early. Add the relentlessly repetitive nature of what goes through each characters mind and I was tempted now and then to pass a few pages and find a place where the story would resume. The main characters long-winded thoughts about surviving in the ""new world order"" left me wondering if Clancy himself is going through a similar crisis. It seems to me that this fine novelist is going for the easy money this time."
4,Enthralling Read: A Good Book for Clancy Fans.,"The book begins with an airplane highjacking and ends with a stunning climax. A fascinating look into the anti-terrorist world, it is a must read for fans of Clancy and his John Clark thriller Without Remorse. At times, this book makes you want to grab a weapon and go at those looney ""tree-huggers"" along with the Rainbow team. At times, a little predictable, but an intersting look at the post Cold War situation of terrorism from within the U.S. Not his best work, but still very readable."
3,"Australian knowledge is lacking, otherwise a solid book.","Rainbow Six is not unusual for a Tom Clancy novel. It shows his usual command of character, plot and structure however Australians will be disappointed with his Australian characters and the Sydney setting. For example his Australian charaters talk like they are British (rather upperclass british) and Sydney airport lies outside of Sydney (rather than very near the city centre), showing that in regard to Australia, Clancy has not done his research. Aside from this Rainbow Six is a solid book with an interesting new use of some of his old characters (Clark and Chavez) in a new setting and addressing, as Clancty did in Executive Orders, biowarfare. This topic however, is not given much of a fresh look, which is disappointing, given that it is such a major issue."
5,Pure Tome? Not really,It started like most other Tom Clancy books and had the right caracters but after that it is quite different.....and I loved it. Although I liked Jack Ryan in his other novels I really enjoyed the focus and attention Tom Clancy gave to Ding and John. I am not sure I cared for the ending but I was thrilled with the book over all.
2,Not Clancy's best work. Phase one of a new movie.,"This book was a predictable disappointment. Clancy got himself between a rock and a hard place with the Delta Force community and elected (correctly) not to give the company store away. With a good director i.e., Tarentino, and some gang members from LA... Rainbow will make for an entertaining movie."
4,A new direction for Clancy and well worth it.,"Basically the book is about a team Mr. Clark has put together of the best-of-the-best counter terrorist specialists. Clancy's description and character building are exceptional along with the fact that this is an action novel (which rarely give you much in terms of character development). The book is long, but very enjoyable due to the story of the building of the team and their first operations. Just because this novel does not take place in the halls of politics or on a warship, his knack for technical and political story telling is not missed. This is a great addition not just to a Clancy library, but a military library as well, due to his knowledge of the subjects he writes about. I can't wait until the follow up to the Rainbow Six."
1,OK...Ha Ha....Now tell me..Where is the Real Tom Clancy?,"Well Tom you finally did it..740 pages (hardcover) of slow reading, repetetive, predictible nothingness. John Clark the ""Dark Side of Jack Ryan"" is nothing but a suit and tie white collar whimp. Ding Chavez must have 240"" thighs from all of the working out he did. The Rainbow Commandos well, I hope that I can read more comic book stories to my 7 year old about virtually invicible heroes like these guys,the X-Men,and Sergeant Rock.I hear there is a new ""Techno-Thriller"" coming out called ""Tree Squad Six"". They are an elite group of commandos who seek out and destroy authors who kill trees for the sake of wasting 740 pages of paper on...well..books that are just plain bad."
1,Not very inspired writing or story.,"I took the recommendation of an earlier reader and bought EYES OF THE HAMMER for four bucks. Great book-- real special ops guys in action. Indeed, based on my military experience in the Rangers, its even more realistic than Clear And Present Danger. I plan on buying the rest of Bob Mayer's series in hardcover-- a better investment of my money than this book was. RANGERS LEAD THE WAY."
2,Too verbose and slow paced.,"I found the book slow moving and over weight. There was too much detail and meaningless info. It felt like he was writing to fill pages rather than fill out the story. Once he got off the soap box, the action was typical Clancy; good. But there wasn't enough of it. This is by far his worst book. I was extremely disappointed, it took me 5 weeks to finish as it never really grabbed me by the throat."
5,"Main plot not very believable, but holds your attention.","I am an avid reader of Clancy, but in his more recent novels he seems to have run out of material. They seem to be of the quality of the paperback ""Ops Center"" series he had produced with others, not very good but Ok for a paperback. Don't spend the $20 for the hardback and wait for it in paperback. Suggest Clancy reread Hunt for October and Red Storm Rising and recapture the realistic sense those had."
2,Third Class Clancy,"I've enjoyed all of Clancy's other works, especially the concise way he changes venues and characters. This had very little of this. Muddy character descriptions, almost no plot, just vaguely interconnected scenes, (some that don't appear to connect until 2/3 through the book), and the worst villians I've read in a long time. His book reads like half political diatribe and half like the first draft of Executive Decision. This one should be missed completely and allow Mr. Clancy a chance to try again, this time without the political undertones."
1,Unexciting and prolonged,"I have read all of Clancy's books and must agree with those who feel this is far from what we have come to expect. Almost the entire book was spent in story development, leading to one very predictable event. With Clancy's books I find myself unable to put them down. With Rainbow Six I found myself having a difficult time picking it up."
3,So much promise...,The premise of the book was intriguing. That is something that you can depend on with Clancy. He tees up some interesting questions which make you think about the grey areas which surround the world of international relations. Maybe I am getting tired of the characters or maybe I felt that too much of the prose in this text was repetitious. Some editing of length would have benfitted the story. The other disappointment was the movement of the story to an inevitable conclusion. There were too many perfect shots and too many lucky breaks.
1,"Says: Rainbow Six Fails Important, Basic Test","I have all of Clancy's books. I re-read them regularly, because they are well crafted, enjoyable, and I learn something new every time. That, to me, is the true test of a great writer - the test of re-readability. The same is true of Rex Stout and his Nero Wolfe series, and others I could name.I'm afraid Rainbow Six is not re-readable. Not even once. It's the first time that has been the case with this author. I wish I did not have to say it. There is so much wrong with this book, I wouldn't know where to begin. It's almost as if someone else wrote it. I wonder what in the world happened..."
3,400 pages too long,Rainbow six was too long. After the first 300 pages of excitement it just goes into a hole of conspericy. Not CLancys best book.
2,Rainbow Six: Should be a Comic Book,"I won't go into deep detail, because you've already read the reviews and you know--by now--the plot of the story. Well, I think the story could have been better, but it was a fun read, and it appeared to me Clancy wanted to broaden his imagination abit, taking us on a ride where the threat is real but--like a good comic book adventure, as done in the Batman series last year, I think--the execution of a super virus is exaggerated. Mr. Clark (Rainbow Six) would be better in comics and the movies than in this form. At least great artists would make it better off.Well, send any comments. I'm sure I could challenge them!!"
3,"Redone plot with Clark playing Ryan, less exciting, too long","The book reads like play it again Sam. Ebola threat but not as much hero or terror as last Ebola threat. Too long and too much time on the firing line. I love the quality of the heros like those in ""Lonesone Dove"". No doubt who is good or bad but the villians and plot requires too much of a conspiracy to be believeable. Hope TC does a better job all the way around if he does another Ryan-Clark-Domingo-character in a book. His poorest effect!"
2,Blech!!!!,"How horrible was this book? To begin, the main character dies in the end, only to be brought back by the terroists? How lame! Avoid this if you have spare time. There are so many great books out there, and this is not nearly one of them!"
4,Rainbow Six,"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six is ingenious. I give this book a good rating, because of the concept and the action. This book is by far the most thrilling book I have ever read. Rainbow Six had me on the edge of my seat. This book also got made into a video game, and for that it would have to be a great book. Another reason I think this book is good is because of the characters are believable. This book has a great sequel. So I give this a 10 out of 10. Read this book and feel the action."
3,Pretty good.,"My first book from Clancy. Decent plot, great ending, but took too long to get to it. I would try another of his books."
1,Save your money (unless a Clancy fan),"What a gagger!Clancy's 1-dimensional characters get more and more boring, and here they're in a plotline that's improbable at best. His treatment of women is condescending, to say the least (one wife, a doctor, says to her spec ops operator husband, ""You kill people? I'm not sure I like that..."")The story, albeit interesting, goes on altogether too long. I found myself reading the last 200 pages or so just to find out what happened.The more detail Clancy goes into, the more he gets wrong. He's descending into Mack Bolan territory, it seems. It takes more than several heads ""exploding like a ripe melon"" to make a decent novel. If you're already a fan, you'll love it-- it's the same crap he's been pumping out since ""Sum of All Fears."" If you're not a fan, grab ""Hunt for Red October"" or ""Red Storm Rising""-- 2 really good ones by Clancy; before he started believing his own press releases."
2,Disappointing plot and character development.,"I have long been a Tom Clancy fan. I have read all of his books, except for the OP-Center series. Executive Orders was and is a personal favorite. Rainbow Six is a disappointment. There is a formula feel to the book along with a manipulation of the reader to Clancy's political point of view. It is all quite obvious. The characters lack depth. The plot is contrived. Finally, at a time when we could do with some reasoned discussion of serious environmental issues, couldn't Tom have found other villians than ""tree huggers"" bent on killing off the human population to save the planet? Instead, Mr. Clancy has chosen to polarize the debate in a poorly written book."
2,And he used to be such a good author...,"Poor Tom Clancy. The Evil Empire is no more, and he has to go looking for villains elsewhere. First Japan, then Iran, with plots becoming less and less believable. And now something that reeks of James Bond's standard ""saving the earth from the evil madmen"" scenario. I have read, re-read, and re-re-read pretty much all of Clancy's work, I own it all, and I dearly love most of it, but it's going seriously downhill. I will continue to buy his books, I guess, because I like the characters (even though I did miss Ryan in this one) and I like his writing style. I guess I'm a sucker for really thick bricks when it comes to books. But this one was the least enjoyable so far."
2,I bet the video game is more exciting...,"While I would consider Tom Clancy one of my favorite authors and will probably buy his next book, I was pretty disappointed in Rainbow Six. I've heard that it is tying in to a computer game with the same name, and I'll be darned if it didn't unfold just like some adventure game. You have your ""easy"" levels (i.e., the bank, the mansion), ""medium"" levels (the amusement park, the hospital), and ""hard"" levels (the Olympics, the Project in Brazil and the mother of 'em all, Project Kansas!). I've loved all of his previous books, and consider myself an unabashed Tom Clancy fan, but the shallowness of this one left me somewhat disappointed. Still a page-turner, but not Clancy at his best."
4,Disappointing,"Like his other Clark book, _Without Remorse_, _Rainbow Six_ falls short of the high standards Clancy set with his Jack Ryan novels. _Executive Orders_ kept me up night after night with its 900 pages, small type and tiny margins. But with _Rainbow Six_, I felt rushed along through the plot. The detailed subplots and technical minutiae which characterize Clancy's best stuff are in shorter supply than I had hoped.As usual, characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts -- fine for Clancy's usual shoot-'em-up fare, but less satisfactory when he tries (as in _Without Remorse_) to handle complex moral issues. I still think Cardinal is the only one of Clancy's characters which might be accepted into the cast of a John Le Carre novel.However, the saying still holds: when Clancy's good, he's superb; when he's bad, he's still pretty darn good. The ending saved this one from 3 stars -- as elegant as anything involving that much destruction could be."
2,The last 50 pages were the worst,"This is by far the worst Clancy book that I have read. The last 50 pages were the worst. Beside his deep hatred for environmentalists, Clancy showed the world that he has no clue on what rich and educated folks would do when they have committed a crime. The ending of this book is just unbelievably bad."
4,TC is at it again,"I am only 200 pages into it but TC has made another book I can't put down!! I have to say that I only give it 4 stars so far because I so far have not seen anything of Jack Ryan and even though he is not a major character They won't even say his name and only small references to ""The President"". I am only 200 pages into it though so maybe I will see a Cameo by Jack Ryan but so far that is the only complaint I have."
3,Tom Clancy or Ian Fleming?,"While this is not a poorly written book it has perhaps the most ridiculous plot of any of his books. I don't want to give away the story but suffice to say that I have seen this in several James Bond movies. The anti-terrorist scenes are well written (although I could do without the repeated descriptions of what a 50 cal bullet does to the human head) and keep the reader interested. All in all I am waiting for the computer game, which is what much of the book is written like. This is much better than those Op-Center books and Politika at least."
2,Tom Clancy's newest book is a boring mishmash...,Rainbow Six started off with a good premise. About one third of the way through the whole idea became absurd. I felt like tossing it but stuck with it hoping the plots would come together but it never happened. I am usually sorry to see Clancy's novels end. When I finished this Rainbow Six I sighed with relief and wondered why I had finished it.
3,Typical Clancy,This novel was a good reference for Jack Ryan Story characters and related actions referenced in other novels. I had not read this novel prior to Executive Order and Locked On. Because of references to the Rainbow Six group I read this novel. It had the typical Clancy writing but not as good as his other novels. The begining with the terrorists on the airplane seemed a bit forced to introduce action. It was unnecessary.
1,Worst piece of writing to hit the streets in years,"The book gives a whole new meaning to ""padding"" senseless episodes meant to set the stage don't. The denoument matches those episodes.In the future Clancy would be well advised to dip his word processor in Kaopectate before he starts!"
1,Barely better than the inflight magazine...,"The only reason I bothered finishing Rainbow Six was that I was trapped on an international flight. The story concept is interesting, but horrendously and repetitively told--editors must be in short supply these days. Don't bother with this one."
1,Glorification of Government Illegal Activity,"This book is not up to the standards of previous Tom Clancy novels. The technical research is not nearly up to the standard of Hunt for Red October and his other novels. In addition there are several references that suggest that not only is gun control good, but illeagal activity by government agencies is necessary and acceptable. The end of the book glorifies a government agency violating the territory of another nation, and murdering United States citizens. Considering what our government has done on its own the past few years I do not enjoy reading books that claim the end justifies the means. I had come to expect more from Clancy's books, but do not intend to waste my money on another one."
1,"A sequel to ""Without Remorse"", but Clancy has lost his touch","Now and then, a good writer writes a bad book. This is one such. ""Rainbow Six"" is Clancy's second book about John Clark, an unromantic CIA agent with a license to kill. His first, ""Without Remorse"", built the character of Clark, and was perhaps Clancy's best writing. ""Without Remorse"" wasn't a techno-thriller, but more of a classic character novel. ""Rainbow Six"" is more a classic Clancy gadget story, but unlike his Jack Ryan novels, this time he can't pull the threads of unlikely events together into a believable whole. The book revolves around a succession of terrorist plots executed for no visible reason, and when the reason finally becomes clear, it doesn't make sense, especially since the bad guys aren't portrayed as dumb.I wonder if Clancy even wrote this turkey. It reads more like the ""Op-Center"" books, on which he puts his name but doesn't write."
2,"Single dimensioned, naiive, typographically flawed.","I've read nearly every Clancy novel. Over the years I've detected a gradual diminishment in the quality of plot, character depth, subplot integration, and richness in wording when comparing his first series of works to this. It's quite possible to skip entire sections in the book-and I did through sheer boredom-yet stay connected with the main plot. I'm disappointed with how unidimensional the novel is with its sophomoric approach to both ""global/environmental"" terrorism and special operations units and tactics. A 300 page novel crammed into 700 pages. Too bad, Tom, you could have done much better....you did before."
2,A fair read. Technically sloppy. Not up to Clancy form.,"Has the timing of the ""Summer"" Olympics moved to January? Only that way could the outdoor temperatures in SE Australia be in the 90s.It read like several separate novellas, strung together. Poor continuity. Many technical (and typo) errors, some glaring (e.g., forgetting season reversal for the southern hemishere).Clancy peaked with Red Storm Rising."
4,Awesomely Fantastic!!!!!,Clancy has written another page-turner with everybody but Jack Ryan in it. We get to see the action that Clark and Chavez do so well--rescuing innocent people and taking out the bad guys--alive when necesary. Dr. Bellows and the British staff are great addtions to the cast of characters. My only beef--no Jack and Cathy Ryan. Maybe next time?
1,Not a Book but a Script for Games,"While reading the book I noticed technical errors, unlike Red October. The plot was setup a hostage rescue, do a hostage rescue, again and again. At the end of the book I found the ads for the game versions and understood why this book was written."
3,Rainbow Six,"Another good book from Tom Clancy, but unlike his other books the ending left me wanting more. At almost 900 pages I tore through the book then put it down and asked, ""is this it... it was to easy."" I was disapointed and have to wonder what Tom Clancy was thinking."
4,Rainbow Six Review,"A fast paced Clancy novel with such detail and realism it seems as if it had already happened, and Clancy was merely recounting the events so ingeniously concieved in this four-star book. Reccomended to anyone with a good imagination and a taste for danger and suspense."
4,Pretty Good,"Rainbow Six was a fun read for me mostly because of the commandos in it. The scenes were the Rainbow team tosses their flash-bang grenades at the hostage takers and save the good guys are very nice. So nice that most of the books other flaws didn't annoy me too much. Some of those flaws are the lame dialogue (EVERY person in the book says ""...y'know?..."" at least six thousand times...), somewhat undeveloped characters, and a somewhat unbelivable plot. Despite all these, odd plot and all, I still liked it."
3,Good read but not Mr. Clancy's best.,"I enjoyed the topic of this book: terrorism and counterterrorism. It seemed that Mr. Clancy developed the plot....ever so slowly...and then became bored with it and just wanted to end it. The end of the book....the last 100 pages or so....seemed rushed and haphazardly put together. This book could have easily become a 1500 pager or the same could have been accomplished in 400 pages. Overall, I enjoyed it but sometimes it just seemed to drag on."
2,Not the real deal,"For all those reviewers who say this book gives a good idea what it's like to be a special operations soldier-- wrong! I spent twenty years in spec-ops and these charicatures are a disgrace to the men I served with. Clancy is an ex-insurance salesman who has no clue either a) what it's like to serve and b) what combat is like. Having said that, I accept this is fiction and needs to be looked at in that like. As far as that goes, how about bad guys who aren't stupid and good guys who believe in the American way-- such as posse comitatus, trial by jury, etc.? If I wanted to go live in a police state there are plenty of countries I could move to. You want real? Try Andy McNabb's SAS books, or James Webb's Fields of Fire, or Stephen Coonts for air combat or Bob Mayer's special forces books. All those others walked the walk."
4,"GREAT AS USUAL, BUT MAYBE GETTING A LITTLE PREDICTABLE...","I love a new Clancy book, and this one is no exception. But two things bothered me. One: I found this one's plot less of a surprise, maybe I've just gotten into the characters. The second thing- the one that really bothered me- was that I caught a research MISTAKE (pg. 640) on Clancy's part -all be it in an area totally out of his field. Mr Clancy, a blanket Appaloosa is the following ""Blanket - refers to a horse which has a solid white area normally over, but not limited to, the hip area with a contrasting base color. "" (Quoted from the Appaloosa Horse Club registration page). Most people won't notice, but anyone who knows App's will be dissappointed that Mr Clancy didn't do better research on this excellent breed of horse I give the book 4 stars but suggest he stick to the military stuff and leave the mammals to Michner!"
4,Great story! POOR proof reading!!,"Having read all of Clancy's novels to date I must admit this is a great story. If you liked, ""Patriot Games,"" I think you will really enjoy ""Rainbow Six."" My big problem with this latest Clancy fancy isn't the story! It is the POOR proofreading. Alas, they have become complacent. Spelling errors abound, important story line foul-ups and yes, folks, grammatical errors. I am most aghast that Mr. Clancy would let this document go to press with his name on it!! The title should be ""Needed: Proofreader."" Please advise your publisher to get on the ball and hire some English-capable people."
1,"Boring, predictable, turgid. Wait a week for bargain book","Tom Clancy is not known for his ability to write prose but at least he usually writes an engaging techno thriller.(Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising). This time his characters aren't substantial enough to qualify as cardboard. The plot is not so original or well written to even be a cliche and is about as exciting as a glass of cold spit. Half-way through the book you may start hoping the terrorists win. A world-wide plague couldn't possibly be more miserable than trying to finish this book If you are a die-hard Clancy Fan and MUST have anything he has written, at least wait a week for it to show up on the bargain table. Better, wait for the paper-back and buy it used."
1,I think Tom Clancy's getting lazy in his success.,"Yuck. Double yuck. And a big yawn. Biggest problems were: (a) too long by at least 40%; (b) characters didn't keep you engaged, except perhaps for Popov; (c) Tom's political views were way too evident; (d) did I say it was too long? Found myself skimming the last half. Much of it seems to be meaningless filler - like he had a page count he was shooting for, and that's further reflected in how incredibly fast the ending was wrapped up; (e) good guys are perfect, bad guys are idiots, how's that for a recipe for boredom. Basically, just an overall bad book. Doubly tragic because he _can_ be a very good writer when he wants to be. Do yourself the favor - go reread Hunt for Red October before picking this one up."
4,My first Clancy novel,This is the first Tom Clancy book I've ever read and I was totally blown away. He has a very deft touch when it comes to keeping the intrigue going and the story really kept me guessing as to the 'bad guys' real motivations.
2,Clancy wrote this?,"By far one of Clancy's worst novels. Is it me or has Clancy fallen into a formulaic style now? It's not even the formula of the book that is disheartening -- it's the grammatical, spelling, and general mistakes that makes this book bad. My general feeling was that this book was rushed to the press and not enough edits were done to it.Aside for the glowing errors in the book, the book is too fluffy. The ending is too neat. And there is just too much ""stuff"" added in the book to make it longer. The ""bad guys"" in the book are way too crazy and the ""good guys"" are way too good.Stock characters, stock story, and bad writing. Shame on you Tom.I hope Clancy's next book is better than this."
1,Incredibly convoluted stupidity,"While the book is well written, its plot is so far-fetched that no matter how good the details (and they are good) I was never able to filter out the voice in the back of my head that kept saying ""This is really stupid!""."
4,Could have been a classic,"Tom Clancy has been one of the world's best-selling author since the release of his first book, Red October, and has consistently produced quality material. Rainbow Six is yet another must-read for any Clancy fan, and is easily picked up as a first Clancy by any casual reader. The plot is full of action and starts early (contrary to most of his books, where it builds up very slowly) and examines one of contemporary society's greatest fears: a doomsday virus.The only major drawbacks to this book are the lack of technical information usually present in his books and the extremely poor editing received by the novel. He repeats himself many times, particularly on the mentality of the team technical wizard, and a simile about ""as normal as zipping his fly"" which is used three times in less than ten pages, and twice on one page.Tom, you write well, and with the aid of a halfway competent editor, this one could have been a classic!"
1,The worst Clancy book ever,"This will be the last Clancy book I buy. Now, Tom's been heading downhill since Clear and Present Danger, but this is by far his worst work and perhaps the worst novel I have ever read. The plot is thin and repititive. The supposed ""climax"" of the book seems almost an afterthought. The dialogue is pathetic and the characters fill typical racial and ethnic stereotypes. Just try saying a few lines of dialogue out loud and you'll realize how silly you sound. No one talks like this. Ever since Debt of Honor, Clancy's right-wing political views have kidnapped his writing (with the exception of Without Remorse). In fact, I was very much looking forward to the next novel featuring John Clark -- Clancy did an admirable job in developing Jack Ryan's alter ego in Without Remorse. But Rainbox Six was sadly disappointing."
3,Too much of nothing in the middle!,"I enjoyed the plot. I enjoyed the action at the beginning of the book. Most I read don't put action up front. But it seems like every other paragraph in the middle and end of the book are saying the same thing. Its like, hey I just need to make this longer. At one point, I counted the exact same dialog three times in a row from the same character. That was disappointing."
4,typical clancy,"I liked the book. It was long with only a few breaks in the action. This was my 1st read in the ongoing saga. Not the way to read Clancy but I saw Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, and Clear and Present Danger as movies so I knew the storyline. Clark and Chavez have come a long way. Action in this one starts with the initial plane trip to England. If you like stories of Super elite teams of good guys beating the daylights out of terrorists, this ones for you. Alot of interesting stuff and some good action."
5,Compelling and exciting,"This is the first Clancy book that I read, and I was quite impressed. The action sequences were fantastic, and really grabbed my attention. The ending was a bit lagging, but overall, I thought this book was awesome. A lot of fun to read."
5,Probably the best book you can buy!,"I am a 14 years old boy from Norway! I have never read any books before this. I tried to read a book on Norwegian, but the book was to boring. But in this book its exciting almost all the time. Its a hijacking starting already at the end on page 4, an that`s great! After the hijacking there`s 5 missions for Rainbow.I recommend this book to all who likes action! Buy this book if you want some excitement! Its worth the money!"
3,predictable and made for tv moviedom,early in the book it was easy to see that tom clancy was wriiting for TVdom.....I liked some of the accurate details of the weaponry and the security sequences but it wrote itself........It was apredictable plot...non of the superheroes would be hindered in their goals........traitors and spies were identified early in the plot. I still think clancy has an in somewhere in black ops to have all the dope he has.........I still liked it.....
1,I'm depressed they chopped down a tree to make this book.,"I have a library of Clancy books. I delight at each new one. The book is not a worthy read for his fans. It is time he changed his pattern. Like Ludlum, Grisham, and Sanders, Clancy needs to change his protagonists and his research. If not, his loyal readers won't keep reading his books. I never thought I'd say this, but it's true. I enjoyed the book very little, but the best book I read this summer is your new posting of Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture, where secret government technology, murder, torture, and plot intrigue rule supreme. Reminded me of Red Storm Rising and Search For Red October by Clancy in his finest form. I do not recommend this book to every Clancy fan. Tried to read it 3 times, no luck. Sorry Tom, you missed the mark by a mile."
1,Same old Clancy only getting stale and sloppy,"What was once fresh and interesting about Clancy (red October/sum of all fears) has become stale and hackneyed. There were so many typos and repetitive passages, I am left with the sense that he bypassed the editing stage due to a tight deadline. The technological insights I enjoyed in the past were exaggerated in this tome with out the benefit of a trully riviting storyline to balance it. Lastly, his descriptive treatment of women leads me to conclude that he's been frustrated in his attempts at relationships with them. This book has convinced a longtime Clancy fan (I've read'em all) to seek out greener pastures."
2,"Dis-appointment, but readable","I come away from Clancy's books expecting two things:(1) to be entertained, and (2) to learn something. In this case, neither of the expectations was fullfilled. The plot is too predicable and a bit campy. And unlike most of his previous books, I did not learn a thing about how a machine works, how a system operates, or the effect of one form of political thought on another. His characters are at best, weak. And of the very few ""snake eaters"" that I have met, his characters are completely unlike the real thing. This book was almost as useless as Patriot Games-hence it will probably be a smash hit in the mass media movie arena."
1,the WORST Tom Clancy to date,"Tom's finally hit bottom...all those million dollar advances have made him soft. The plodding, downright boring pace of this latest incarnation of the Jack Ryan series..(John Clark) has watered down the thrills of the first three books in this series and made this a not-read."
4,Nose bleed,"I began to suspect something when I'd find my nose smeared in dried blood every morning. The shear weight of this monstrosity falliing on my face as I fell to sleep reading it may have caused permanent damage. But every night I plodded on, waiting for the big event. It came with only 40 of the 740 pages to go and I thought the most interesting plot aspect was an opportunity missed. I'm glad I read it. I think it has ruined the movie for me though. I'm still the Clancy fan...but fading."
3,Good action mixed with BS,"I spent a lot of $$ on this thinking itwould be good, but it is filled with cardboard characters, a plot taken from a Duke Nukem clone, and a whole bunch of tree hugging. Nevertheless, Clancy manages to entertain up to the last 200 pages, where he loses it. Worth the first 500, though."
4,Not as good as Debt of Honor but OK,"There's nothing better than kicking back and reading a good war novel or techno-thriller. RAINBOW SIX was suspenseful and well done, but Clancy is starting to get in a rut. He needs some new fields to plow. I just wish he would do a WWII book once, this year's crop--THE THIN RED LINE, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, and WAR OF THE RATS are all pretty good, but no one can touch Clancy when it comes to military thrillers. Come on, Tom, write something about the stand at Moscow, or the Battle of Midway or something, it would be great!!"
5,Engaging from page one!,"Another Tom Clancy success! I love this book- even the technical parts. It was great! I had no idea it was possible to fall in love with fictional characters, but I love Ding!"
2,You know what this book reminds me of....?,"...A computer game. Coincidence? Hardly. Let's face it, this is a sad piece of work from someone who brought us ""The Cardinal of the Kremlin."" You've made a quick buck Clancy, now go back and write a real novel. -A Big Clancy Fan (or was...)"
2,If you want a narrative for the video game...,"Rainbow Six is not one of Tom Clancy's better efforts. The reader is taken through an escalading series of contrived terrorist crises driven a most implausible antagonist. The book reads so much like a video game, that I was not the least bit surprised to see the video game on store shelves shortly thereafter. To me the book seems like an afterthought of the software development.My advice is buy the game (if that's your sort of thing) and skip to The Bear and the Dragon if you're a Clancy fan."
5,Rainbow 6,Rainbow 6 was the greatest book I've ever read. It deals with a great amount of action for the SWAT team lover. It made me go out and buy the computor game.
3,"reasonable, until the end...","a reasonably written book, it certainly had me turning the pages. unfortunately, it closed off quite poorly.*slight spoiler*i just can't believe the ending - the ""bad guys"" (actually, i have far more sympathy for them than for the rainbow crew) just gave up. just like that. ten years, billions of dollars, and they just threw it all in the incinerator. no plan ""b"". no recovery attempt. nothing.no - that is quite unrealistic..."
3,Disappointing,"For some reaon I feel compelled to add my voice to the resounding call of disappointment found in the preceding reviews. I have loved Clancy's work from the start. However, this lengthy novel seems contrived at best. I got the impression that Clancy has run out of new ideas (using biological warfare a second time in as many books) and character development. Given the choice, I'd rather re-read ""Wtihout Remorse""."
3,"Classic Clancy! Detailed, accurate, absorbing.","I am a Clancy fan and impatiently await each novels arrival in the bookstore window. Rainbow Six was my first Clancy novel on CD. I have been so enthralled with the novel via this medium that I have missed my exit on the expressway twice this week. David Dukes commands each character with a unique voice and compelling individuality via use of accents and inflections. Listening to this book as given it a dimensionalilty I have never experienced before. It is filled with the rich detail I seek in a Clancy novel. No one else can narrate a bullets journey in slow motion from barrel to head piercing and make me savour every moment. I recommend the novel, but for those of you fans who have never listened to one, I recommend letting David Dukes be your first. I have actually begun to look forward and enjoy my commute to work!"
1,Is Clancey Really Writing This?,"What has happened to the man who wrote ""Hunt For Red October"" and ""Red Storm Rising?"" This unbelievable plot about enviormentalists trying to rule the whole strain credulity. With all this militia stuff happenings all over how could Tom ever believe that anyone why find this story interesting. Unfortunately, this is the last Clancy book for me."
2,A poor effort by Clancy-- recommend others.,"With this overly long book, Tom Clancy is opening the door for other thriller writers to gain the prominence they deserve. I personally prefer to read writers who have some background in what they write about, not those who invent everything. Stephen Coonts is a former combat pilot who knows whereof he writes. Bob Mayer, whether writing under his own name or the pen names Joe Dalton and Bob McGuire, is a former Green Beret who has a bunch of very good books out there begging to be read. Check them out."
4,Great! But not like The Hunt for Red October,"Clancy has pulled off another great book. But not as good as Patriot Games or The Hunt for Red October. This is because usually an author can only make only one or two exceptional books. There are exceptions and to date Clancy is not one of them. Yet this book was a good read that was a little long but hey, a few all nighters never hurt anyone. In all it is a great book with a good plot, detail and charecter development."
3,Something went wrong!,"What happened with my favorite american writer. I like the idea about Clark building this team of black-ops soldiers and the first couple of stunts they pull are thrilling reading, with lots of information about antiterror hard-ware and tactics. Then something goes wrong. Too fast we are told who the bad guys are and what they are planning. Too fast and too easy they are destroyed in the jungles of Brazil. It could look like the author has run out of ideas and then decides to recycle the Ebola-plot. But I do sincerely hope that is not true. If it is, mr. C should take a break from the techno-thrillers. And could somebody please tell me what happened to Jack Ryan, or is it not allowed to speak out his name in public anymore? N.B At least it made a great computergame!"
3,"On page 470, and these reviews aren't encouraging","I've read them all, and in order, I've always bought the Hardbacks. However, the quality of the stories and the writing has been deteriorating. Tom, it's not quantity (op center series that you didn't write, I hope) its quality!!! R-6 so far has just barely kept my interest, but because I'm a big fan I will read the rest and post a more complete review. Until then Take your time, stories about simple yet interesting plots and simple people can be just as captivating as crashing a 747 into the state of the union speech, or some billionaire trying to wipe out the world."
2,Not Clancy's best but entertaining.,"This book could have benefitted from some serious editing. The repetitive passages of environmental talk really got boring. Some exciting action made it worth the time to read, but I found the ending very unsatisfying with many loose ends not properly resolved. Tom needs a really tough editor!"
2,Rainbow Six:Lots of Pages,"Wait for the paperback folks. The Clancy well is going dry. Old Tom should read other works like Lady President, Blind Mans Bluff or Fortunes or War."
2,"A decent story, but far from Clancy's best effort","While John Clark and Ding Chavez are two of my favorite charactors in the Clancy stable, the story of Rainbow Six was among the slowest, most laborious books I have ever read. I have read all of Clancy's novels (including the Ops Center series) and concluded that this story was more a rip off of the Ebola-scare plot in Executive Orders than the fresh storyline each of his other novels have been. Even the sequel nature of Debt of Honor/Executive Orders was fresher and more interesting than Rainbow Six. I have normally finished each of his other novels in one or two weeks because the stories grab you and you can't put the book down. I took me months to finish this one. The only reason I did finish the book was out of loyalty to Clancy.I will buy and read his next one, but I hope it's much better!"
1,What has happened to Tom Clancy?,"I've read six or seven Tom Clancy novels, and this was by far the worst of the lot. I could barely finish it, and when I had, I donated my copy of the book to my local library. ""Red Storm Rising"" was great - moderately plausible plot, interesting characters, shades between good and evil, enough technical detail to keep one's interest. This book had a totally implausible plot, a collection of cardboard characters (GOOD/BAD), an absurd ending filled with shooting fish in a barrel... It is hard to imagine that this would have been published if it had been written by an unknown author. Very disappointing!"
2,This is inane --almost funny! - Clancy'e worst novel.,I've read all of Tom Clancy's novels and have enjoyed most of them. This book features a completely illogical plat - poor character definition - inane dialoque. If this had been Clancy's first novel - he would not have had a second - don't waste your time or the money.
3,Predictable but worthy,"Having followed Clancy through every single book published, I'd have to say that Rainbow Six is definitely not on par with the top three: Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising and Executive Orders. Talked to several people who thought it was too long, but R6 doesn't even compare to RSR and EO.Predictable in many places. Still has the Techno down to a ""T"". Overall a decent read. Definitely not his best effort. I'd recommend to Mr. Clancy to quit with the small stuff and do the extra work and spend more time and effort to create the classics of before."
2,Did Tom Clancy really write this?,"I don't believe Tom Clancy wrote this. I've read two of his books, and each page of each one taught me something. The only factoid that I learned in this book was that people with licenses to carry guns on airplanes have to meet each other and the pilot before getting on board. Tom probably gave that factoid to his ghostwriter on this one."
4,Clancy at the pulpit,"I must say, Tom Clancy has gone from story writing to preaching from the pulpit in the last two books. His first books gave the reader plot twists which were unexpected. Now, we have a storyline about Ebola and terrorists reused from Executive Orders and Sum of All Fears. In Executive Orders, Mr Clancy preached his political-economic views. In Rainbow Six, Mr Clancy is pounding us with his anti-environmentalist attitudes. I am not an envrionmentalist, but he exudes such an attitude towards them that a naif would come away from the book thinking that environmentalists were all nazis worthy of the worst form of death.However, all this asside, I must still give the book four stars because frankly, I couldn't put it down...I just had to skip the political diatribe, which, if edited out, would have brought the book down to a trim 300 pages."
3,"Not his best, but still a page turner","Clancy is perhaps best known for his ability to tell stories that his readers cannot tear themselves away from. Rainbow Six is no different, however, the end seemed a little lacking and anti-climactic. While the super-terrorists recieve a very ""Clark-ish"" demise (as expected), the immediate events leading up to that do not challenge the Rainbow team or the reader.My advice would be to finish the book, and then re-read the amusement park chapters, or those set in Austria for a good final kick."
4,About time,"Mr. Clancy has bored the world in his recent novels (in which it takes about a thousand pages for nothing to happen.) Finally, he has written a book where something happens, it starts happening at the beggining, and it is truly engaging. Plus a hell of a lot of action. His characters are less than two-dimensional , but who cares? This is a techno-thriller, not Wuthering Heights. Mr. Clancy, it's good to have you back."
1,Disappointing,"Clancy has moved from an adventure novelist to a right-wing loonie standing on soapbox spouting his views. His book lampoons the Constitution, the environmental movement, individual rights, the press, non-smokers and gun laws. In between shot outs, he tries to rewrite history and show off his ""technical knowledge"". I wish he would have left his political agenda at home and gotten an editor, who would have trimmed the book by a couple hundred pages."
1,Wonder what happened to Clancy,"It seems Clancy is getting into his slump period, unless this book is written by his ghost writters. Clancy has written theose wonderful stories in his earlier books like ""red storm rising"", ""cardinal of ...."" and etc... This ""Rainbow 6"" makes Clancy fan ,like myself, wonder if this is the time to wander away from his new writings.This book is like a Elton John's ""Blue Moves"" album.Ater those series of shining brilliant works, this book was giving signals that the talent of the writter is finally start showing the sign of waning. My hunger and thirst to Clancuy's new books is drying up as well. Unlike before, unfortunatly, the time has come that grabing his new books without consideration could be a total dissapointment. I hope this is just a temporaly set back, and expect his come back with books with edges."
1,Clancy Displays His Arrogance,"If Clancy had cut about 300 pages of repetitious internal monologues it might have been at least readable. He didn't. Clancy thinks quantity makes a good book. He proves that wrong. The plot was unbeliveable. The characters flat and poorly motivated. Clancy is obviously not a student of human nature--not even to the extent of creating believable villans. The premises in the book are completely implausible. Thousands of people banding together to kill off humankind--with almost perfect security? Right. He doesn't even bother to check the tempertures in Sidney in July. It's winter there, John. It's cold. It's not 97 degrees F. He proves that all it takes is a big name to sell a book. I'll never buy another one of Clancy's peices of trash. I've been burned once. I won't be a fool and be burned again."
1,An absolute disappointment,"First let me tell you that I've always been a Clancy fan and have read most of his books. From ""Red Dawn"" to ""Clear and Present Danger"" I always enjoyed his attention to technical detail.I'm sorry to say that this book has none of that. It's as if a different person wrote it. The characters are shallow, boring and not very believable. The story line is almost a repetition of his prior work. I found myself skipping through pages in order to make it to the excruciating end.This is the last Clancy book I'll read. I consider my money wasted."
1,"sloppy, dull and all that","I'm a fan of Clancy's early efforts but stopped reading after the Debt of Honor fiasco. I sympathize with the author in that the end of the cold war has led to a dearth of good material. However, Clancy doesn't need my sympathy in that plenty of people who read Red October and loved it, keep buying these stupid books (like me). Put it this way, when you start to suspect that this is going to be the worst novel you have ever read, stop reading. You'll be doing yourself a favor because I can promise you that your suspicions are correct."
3,I've read better......<Contains Spoilers>.,"As an old fan of Clancy's I was eager to read his latest. I found however that the book, while riviting and absorbing in places, become long-winded and drawn out, causing me to actually put the book down, and come back to it about 2 months later. What really got me is how easily the whole plan to spread the virus was foiled. One would expect some dramatics; guns firing, the canaster being dropped and nearly being broken or anything along those lines, but no....it was more like,Ding : ""Hey you with the Virus canaster, hand it over."" ; Bad Guy : ""Um...ok...here.""I mean the story was like a train hitting a mountain and stopping dead.I wouldn't recommend this book, save your money. You'll read it and realise that the last 400 or so boring pages could be summed up into about 50."
5,HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE THIS BOOK?,"This book was absolutely amazing! I cant believe that some of you people thought it was too long, or that the ending was too rushed. This book combined everything from terrorist standoffs to a fatal viral disease. Trust me, read this book, you wont be able to put it down!"
1,John Doe,"Unfortunately I am one of those people who crave the release of a new Tom Clancy novel, however, being so few and far between, I have found myself passing time reading non-fiction books and research on specialized warfare. It becomes painfully obvious within the first few chapters of this book that Tom didn't do his research. He may have gotten a little information, but he most certainly made most of it up.Being well versed, myself, in the tactics, weaponry, and explosives used by spec-warriors, his accounts lacked realism. His depiction of British SAS standards, German GSG-9, and some US forces just weren't true to the levels that these individuals truly prepare for.I must admit I tended to enjoy the tedious technicalities in Clancy's novels, but in this one, the technicalities are WRONG, and I found myself agitated when reading them.If you enjoy quite a few action scenes with predicatble outcomes, this one's for you, but if you know anything about specwar, stay away from it."
2,Would have been good at 500 pages.,"I had only read one other book by Clancy (SSN), when I decided to pick this one up. I expected something action-packed, but what action there was, was dull and repetitive. It's the same ""aamericans are better than everyone else in the world"" plot, and it seemed that the terrorists never really stood a chance during any of their missions. This book also should be clipped down to about 500 pages, and it probably would be much more effective."
2,Where's the editor?,"I was looking forward to reading another book focusing on John Clark after enjoying ""Debt of Honor,"" but this one is very disappointing. Usually it takes a hundred pages for me to ""get into"" a Clancy novel. This book starts out OK, but gets more and more boring as the lengthy pages progress. What I really wished for was a decent editing job that would have cut the pages in half, focused the plot, and cut out the unnecessary diatribes against the environmental movement, entertainment industry (Disney), and so forth. I wondered what Newt was doing these days - he was secretly collaborating with Clancy on this book! On the plus side, Clancy has put more focus on the characters; however, it will be a long time before characterization alone can carry his books. If you really need to read every Clancy novel, at least wait for the paperback or, better yet, an abridged audiotape."
2,Bad-- read something else,"This book is simply bad. Apparently Mr. Clancy feels he had it made and doesn't have to really put much effort into plot, characters or setting. I took the advice of earlier reviewers and read THE OMEGA MISSILE by Joe Dalton. A very good thriller. You also might want to check out Bob Mayer's special forces series of books, like DRAGON SIM-13 or CUT OUT. At least Mayer wore the green beret and knows what he's talking about. And his books are damn good."
2,Clancy has lost his touch,"This is a real third rate book - implausible plot, improbably perfect good guys, and unbelievably evil bad guys. The political intrigue, careful attention to technical details, and suspenseful plots of some of Clancy's earlier books don't appear in this volume. Suspense in the story is soon quashed because the good guys are absolutely perfect and flawless - nothing they attempt ever fails in any respect. Have a serious hostage situations? No problem - sneak in, shoot all the bad guys, save all the hostages - repeat, rinse. There is no attempt to keep the bad guys in character. Need to kill off a mild mannered laboratory researcher in order to tie up some lose ends in your store? - its easy, just have him grab a rifle and charge out to shoot at the good guys. I think I've read my last Clancy novel."
2,"More Clancy, same style and plot? But a good read.","I have a library of Clancy books. I delight at each new one. The book is a worthy read for his fans, but it is time he changed his pattern. Like Ludlum, Grisham, and Sanders, Clancy needs to change his portagonists and his research. If not, his loyal readers won't keep reading his books. I never thought I'd say this, but it's true. I enjoyed the book, but it was a hard read. Not fun. The best book I read this summer is your new posting of Brad Steiger's new book, Alien Rapture, where secret government technology, murder, torture, and plot intrigue rule supreme. Reminded me of Red Storm Rising and Search For Red October by Clancy in his finest form. I recommend this book to every Clancy fan."
2,A little exciting but very far fetched,"Rainbow Six is a somewhat nice book but falls in a lot of nonsense and political babbling. Clancy centers more in the paranoid extreme political views of heroes and antiheroes characters using sci fi tech rather than giving attention to the special operations area. He centers very much in Clark but leaves outside other potentially interesting characters. There is also a lack of a well defined, really exciting climax point in the plot."
2,"A script for a ""B"" movie","Clancy's first 3 or 4 offerings were thrillers. His latest is a predictable, flight of ideas, stream of consciousness. He has run out of technobabble with which to wow his readers."
2,Taking your audience for granted.,"While I don't expect literary perfection in a tecno/spy/military thiller, Clancy's work in ""Rainbow Six"" is poor enough to insult the itelligence of even his most die hard fans. While the over the top portrayals of the environmentalist-wackos were entertaining, they were overshadowed by the weak develpment of a shallow and repetitive plot. The poor quality of the book's editing make it clear that this book was rushed to market to satisfy the expected ( and,no doubt, realized ) demand. It appears,( to use a metaphor that is repeated three times in the first half of the book ) that Clancy gave no more thought to the crafting of this book than to ""zipping his fly""."
1,bad,"As a novel, this book is poorly written. As a Tom Clancy book, this is criminal negligence. It seems like whole sections of irrelevant material are stuck in just to make the book longer. This book bears no resemblance to any previous Tom Clancy novel."
3,Not Tom Clancy's best but ok,"Contrary to some of the reviews I have read, the book started with a bang but instead of building up suspense (as claimed), it dragged on a few moments. It took me a while to connect the sub-stories into the major plot.Well, the novel ended quite funny. Apparently,Tom Clancy has humnor underneath all that espionage thing :-)"
3,"Good idea, but too many words","I liked the plot and the characters. It's a good premise with fascinating possibilities. Clark and Ding Chavez are two of Clancy's best creations. But the book is just way too long. It would be a solid hard-to-put-down read if Clancy could be a little more concise and spare us having to read every single little detail about each character, weapon, locale, building, vehicle, thought, device, action etc. Puh-leeeease! I like the techno-babble, but he's losing control! Clancy is getting to be like a person who loves the sound of his own voice. He should take a lesson from Elmore Leonard and keep the story moving. Or better yet, think back to the books that made him famous such as The Hunt For Red October and The Cardinal Of The Kremlin - Both less than 600 pages. This one has too many words!"
2,"Flat, Pat, and Kinda Dull","This was not very good Clancy. For one thing, everything worked just too well. The action scenes and the way the good guys always won were too pat. I didn't think he did anything particular with the characters. Of course, as a long-time Clancy reader, I have a pretty good idea of Clark and Chavez. They weren't very interesting in this one. I read a library copy. I don't think I'll bother with buying a copy of my own, even in a couple of years at the used book store."
3,Entertaining but with weaknesses,"Rainbow 6 is pleasant to read and interesting. The military are too idolized and idealized but we've come to expect that from Clancy. However, although he strains for a pretend objectivism, his distate and contempt for ecologists is a little too obvious. The suspense goes nicely up but you lose interest after the hospital crisis and the ending is disappointing. And there is something definitely spooky about the young hero already planning to make a Soldier/killing machine out of his just newly born son, wether you're pro-military or not."
5,A MUST READ,I read alot of Tom Clancey books but this is byfar the best book he has written. I have one word for those who said this book wasent all that great: I would like to see you write a better book. If u have not read this book yet READ IT.
2,Hands off!!,"Don`t read this book, it isn`t worth the time and money! No real characters in this book, just killing machines on both sides of the law trying to look at least a little human, but failing. Lots of stereotype impressions. The only good thing is the tension during the counter-terrorist attacks but everything is over soon and you have to wait for the next terrorist happening because the story between the action is so boring."
5,Clancy's Best Yet...,"Definately the best of all of Clancy's novels. This book is action packed all the way through. Also, a very suprising ending. They've made a game from Rainbow Six, now its time for a movie!"
2,Best-selling Rainbow Six is formulaic and wooden,"A re-reading of Tom Clancy's initially disappointing ""Rainbow Six"" would suggest that the best-selling author needs to take a sabbatical. The plot, to use the term loosely, is reminiscent of a series of scripts for a television series. The book is formulaic and, much as it pains a Clancy fan who has read all his previous work, having purchased them in hardback, the characters are wooden."
2,The Books Plods thru'....,"Take the usual Clancy team, add a few terrorists, viruses, egomaniacs and a splash of KGB - shake hard. - Garnish with a stick of global techno globedegock - and viola - you have Rainbow Six !!The book lacks the punch and the grip that one is used to from a Clancy thriller. The plot has promise but the deliverable is not upto the mark. Pages can be skipped without missing anything."
1,Should really only get half a star.,"Repitious, boring, techno-babble that makes you want to skip pages. If I read the word ""double-tap"" (Dings' favorite word) I thought I might puke. Plot was too anticipated. It always seemed that I knew what was going to happen a chapter before it actually did. And by the way Tom, since your Rainbow Six warriors had had four or five missions in row, in a three month period, don't you think they'd be a little suspicious about the Olympics? I could think of a better way to release an airborne contagion than that. Australia is a little too isolated from the rest of the world to let loose a plague that is going to wipe out humanity."
3,Clancy nails another one.,"Clancy wrote today's news yesterday. Clancy has an uncanny ability to look ahead and identify tomarrows issues and to write a novel based on the inteligence he has gathered. As with Clear and Present Danger, Sum of All Fears and many other of his books. He writes a very plausible novel on issues that could be tomarrows headlines. He takes many subplots and blends them into one story. Rainbow Six while not one of his best books is still a must read."
3,Entertaining...but lacking,"Tom Clancy, yet again, brings out a masterfully written piece of literature. From beginning to end it screams adventure, but that's about it. The characters lack depth (along with the plot), and the book is way too long, even for an espionage story. All in all, Rainbow Six is a great book to read when you have exactly nothing to do."
2,Not the Clancy I knew & loved,"Rainbow Six is a long, drawn out, way too wordy, lousy clancy book. The plot is intriguing, but the book could have been written within 200 pages instead of 700+ pages. I have read all of Clancy's first 8 or so novels, and they were great. Then the next few I read, it seemed as though he had others writing for him, because the style, and especially the content, changed. I would not recommend buying this book. It is not worthy of the time it takes to read it."
2,Has Clancy sold out for a port to a computer game?,"It's no surprise that the Rainbow 6 computer game came out around the same time as the book. The book seems to have been written to make a computer game of it really easy, sacrificing a good deal of suspense once you realized his formula. Also, the book was too easy. No surprise that good defeats evil here... pretty boring read. Oh, the editing was lousy too. For all the eco-conscious verbiage in the novel, Clancy could have easily pared 100 pages off the final length w/o the reader noticing."
3,Not up to par.,"I bought this book the day it came out and withing 150 I was thoroughly upset at having made the purchase. I read somewhere that Clancy cranked out Rainbow Six in just a few months and it shows. Thin plot, repetitive text and no mystery. It is no coincidence that a PC game quickly followed its releasse. I suggest Clancy fans re-read Patriot Games."
2,Wait for the paperback,"Unfortunately, you can't always have a winner. This latest effort by Tom Clancy was a major disappointment. It could pass for a tupical commuter junk book. If this was a movie it would be considered a B-Movie. The plot was just a rehash of his last novel. There was little suspense and you can figure out who the hero was very early on. It was too predictable. Frankly his op-center novels have been better than Rainbow Six"
2,"Too long, not enough characterization and what an agenda","I'm not sure Clancy could go any more right wing than he does in this book. Success seems to have gone to his head and he's slapping his name on anything and everything to get a buck. I won't read any more of his books. Instead I'll support writers who actually served our country and can write fast-paced, well-researched action. I recommend Harold Coyle, Stephen Coonts, Bob Mayer, and Joe Dalton. Take a look at their books."
3,Time for a break,"This novel was still unmistakably Clancy (good enough for devout Clancy fans, but not good enough to convert non-believers), but it definitely did not give me the same pleasure as some of his other novels. I found the storyline weak in places, sometimes bordering on the realms of science fiction. This was quite dissapointing as I've always enjoyed Clancy's ability to totally absorb me in the sometimes highly technical dimension of his novels (Red Storm Rising is an excellent example of how technical descriptions can add to the story and tension.)I got the impresssion at times that I am reading a first draft. If you have an editor MR Clancy, fire him, otherwise get one please.Another suggestion, take a year or two off, stay away from Op-Centre, Net Force and the like (they are just bad for your image) and hit us with another series similar to the Jack Ryan novels."
2,A contrived piece of trash...,"After reading between the lines of Clancy's last three novels, I expected the plot of the next one to center around a Sino-Russian rumble for Siberia (which would have been great I might add), but instead we were treated to Rainbow Six, an entirely implausible and ridiculous story. I'm no tree-hugger, but this book shows such contempt for environmentalism it'll leave a bad taste in your mouth. Try not to let your hate show so plainly next time, Mr. Clancy."
2,The least good of Tom Clancy's Books,"I have been trying to get through this book with two thoughts in mind - when will it get better and why is he just rehashing the last book. If I had my druthers, I would have just listened to it on cassette. The specifics of the special ops unit has been the only part of the book that has been interesting."
1,"Clancy the gun totin, wanna-be Soldier of Fortune loser","If this book doesn't take you back to GI Action Series comics of the 50s, nothing will. This is about as 2-dimensional and dumb of story as you will find in your airport's bookstore. And that includes the romance novels. Clancy's bad-boys tote the 10mm MP-10, which Clancy seems to have an infatuation with, and ""double-tap"" all the bad guys. Even when he kills a little sick child at an amusement park, his macho boys write it off as ""well, she was gonna die of cancer in a week anyhow."" Give it a rest. Do us a favor, make your testosterone overloaded characters do somthing realistic, like turn the guns on each other, and remove the woman-bashing prose."
2,Not up to Clancy's normal excellence.,The plot was a little too contrived and too far fetched to be belivable. Some of the stuff sounded like it came from a Mac Bolan story. I think Clancy is resting on his laurels.
3,OK But Far To Long,"Being an avid reader who reads about 3-4 books per month, I found this book to be interesting but way, way to long. There were many dead spots in the book where I would lose interest and even contimplated not finishing it. Clancy could have gotten the same result in about 300 less pages. Too much time introducing characters and setting the plots."
2,Technobabble; little suspense; environmentally ignorant.,"I've always enjoyed Clancy, because he usually taught me something in a suspenseful, quick moving story. Yeah, it was apparant his political view wasn't quite mine; but, hey, he often made a good case for the other POV. Until now. Clancy has absolutely no understanding of environmental concerns. Equating them with druads and cultish religious fringes is pure nonsense. Its the author who sounds like a ""bomb hugging"" nut. Clancy has lost his credibility, which was barely floating after Executive Orders, anyway."
3,Nowhere near Clancy at his best,"If its action you want then you won't be disappointed, it fires up 'movie style' in the first chapter. However this novel lacks the depth, complexity and techo-education that are the usual Clancy hallmarks. Like other reviewers I found the plot too derivative of Executive Orders and the prose far too repetative. I guess now that Jack has made President there just wasn't anywhere else for him to go and we have to make do with the less sophisticated Clark and Chavez!"
1,More junk that will sell,"More boys and their toys crap from the man who can't write but who sells like crazy.Those who buy rather than get this from the library should keep in mind that Clancy is a right-winger who loved Star Wars, helped Reagan & co. spread their paranoia, and has given unqualified support to the most extreme comments of the NRA."
1,Ugh. You have to be kidding me.,"Clancy has officially hit rock bottom. I couldn't believe how ridiculously one-sided this book was. The good guys are perfect, and the bad guys have the emotional intelligence of a six-year-old. I'm hoping that the American military doesn't have the same perception of our enemies as Clancy does.What really bothers me is that even some of the most successful special forces operations in history--especially those which took place in such public settings as what is described in Rainbow Six--had a few things go wrong; hostages were killed and soldiers were injured. Some even completely fell apart. Clancy apparently either didn't do his homework on this or simply chose to disregard it.I was really, REALLY disappointed in this book. I am (or maybe was) a huge Clancy fan, and while the technical details were still there to satisfy a hard-core military techno-geek, the story was somewhat absurd, and the dialogue is bad, even for Clancy."
1,Simply his worst,"Does he ever have his books proofread before they are printed? I've never seen so many spelling mistakes in a book before.To make matters worse, the plot of this book is absolutely ridiculous. Mr. Clancy obviously doesn't have any clue about environmental issues.On top of that Rainbow Six is repetitive and just plain boring."
2,Too far-fetched,"...Clancy undoubtedly is good action writer and a writer who knows the technological gadgetry that goes with the covert operations game. This he uses to good effect.However, I found most characters unidimensional at best, and although Clancy attempts at times to get beneath the skin of the protagonists, in my opinion, he does not succeed very much.Again, in an effort to build a story, he uses too many coincidences, and simplification of events. How else would you explain the fact that Popov was identified because the discarded passport was located due to a malfunctioning trash-can,...Far far too far-fetched!And one last irritiant, why does Clancy have to use '/' so often. Surely if he can last through 740 pages, he can do more than slash?..."
1,Regression to the mean,"This book lends further credence to Galton's principle of ""regression to mediocrity."" Not only does Mr. Clancy give readers a feeble conclusion to his tangled plot, but he also managed to give the impression that the reader is in a video game, with the end of each chapter leading to a higher level of difficulty for Mr. Clark and his team.I was one of those tricked by the ""TOM CLANCY"" on the front cover of this book. If you want to be entertained while getting some insight about the world we live in, get a good history book. That would be a better use of your time and money. To Mr. Clancy, thank you for sharing with us your exceptional stories, but I think your Ryan and Clark franchise has already ran out of steam."
1,"Nice looking, bad tasting...","I am glad that I finished Rainbow Six.The story is simple: An american-british special operations outfit, with two NATO and one Israeli alibi members, ""zaps"" incompetent terrorists in European countries. Only with more grueling gore and technical detail than in the statement above.Then there is that Eco-terrorist conspiracy by some gene-splicing geniuses and their likewise ecologically indoctrinated co-believers. Nice idea, bad execution.Previous Clancy books had me hooked as to their outcome and to the twists Clancy could apply to the storyline. This one I was glad I had finished.Even the rants about Eco-activists, vegans and feminists were boring after the first few. It is only symptomatic that female characters on the good side are either physicians/nurses or moms/grandmoms."
2,"Interesting Premise, Clancy's Usual Mediocre Writing","Clancy has gotten the best-selling writer thing down to a formula: a taut, suspenseful plot populated by militaristic all-American heroes and the evil-doers de jour. His merit lies in coming up with gripping, if improbable, settings for his stock characters. On the other hand, his actual writing is mediocre, unimaginative, and devoid of art.Rainbow Six is the conservative Clancy's broadside against the environmental movement. The book's basic (and typically unbelievable) premise is that, in order to save the planet, fanatical environmentalists in charge of a major corporation devise a plot to kill off nearly all of mankind, while the brave men of the elite multinational force to which the title refers strive to thwart them. The unbelievable part: environmentalists in charge of a major corporation! Everybody knows that all the big corporations are in the capable hands of patriotic, polluting, profiteering Republicans."
1,Bad Political Rant Done Badly,"One of the things that made Clancy's best novels great was the way he kept 20 interlinked stories going at once in descriptive, but not excessive detail that kept your heart racing. He had an amazing ability to protray each group from their viewpoint without judgement, and with some accuracy. He did the best and the worst of society. Apparent his hate of even the mildest of Environmentalists is too great to allow this type of protrayal, or he just didn't have time to do any research on Environmentalist any place other the National Review. His protrayals of the groups involved is shallow and unbelievable, and he has conpensated for only involving a few groups by increasing detail about things he clearly doesn't understand. This book is so bad it goes on the very short list of Books that I can't finish and plan to throw in the garbage to avoid punishing others with its poorly written drivel."
2,Clancy needs to get his head back down to earth,"Tom Clancy has a big ego and is not afraid to let it show. Just look at the back cover. This book is about three hundred pages too long. All the extra material is Clancy demonstrating his knowledge of all things political, historical, and military. There is no character involvement and very little tension. The premise and some of the plot are fascinating and very thought provoking. That is the only thing that kept me reading until the end.Bring back the old Clancy please! Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising are five star books. Everything since then has been on a downhill slide. Read ""Arc Light"" by Eric Harry if you want to be reminded of Clancy in his good old days."
4,Full of action and Guns I definite 4.5,I think this book is really good for fast readers but otherwise it is really long. But it does have a lot more action in the book than usual. I wouldn't recommendEd this to people who haven't read Tom Clancy because Rainbow Six isn't any thing like all his other books. But it is great for a third Tom Clancy read. If you like lots of action and a sort of mystery you will love this book. But it is sort of the same old save the world thing.
1,Dumb plot.,I have eagerly awaited each of Tom Clancy's new books since Red Storm Rising. Each has been worse than the previous. This book has hit rock bottom. This book has a dumb plot and is rounded out by dumb characters. I'm ashamed to say that I wasted around $6 and numerous hours reading this dumb book.
4,A thrilling commandos- cum- terroists story,"This is one of the best friction written by Tom Clancy. Simply exciting for those who love to read how the terroists are being killed by the elite commandos. The story is great, though the ending is a bit disappointing."
4,Predictable - but great,"After reading the prolouge of this book, I just couldn't put it down until I was finished. I've read several other Clancy books, but this one takes the price. Sure, it's a bit predictable, but it's written with the words of someone with real insight in the business, so it's well worth a buy!"
2,Very weak.,The poorest of an increasingly weak string of novels from the factory known as Clancy. Suggest he retire. Try others. Like McNabb's SAS series of Mayer's Special Forces series.
4,"Thrilling, yet a couple thin spots in the plot.",One of Tom's better works. This will keep you going for a good long time
4,ITS TOMS BEST BOOK YET,"IT WAS A GOOD BOOK BUT TO MUCH CUSSING ALSO HAD TO MUCH DETAIL IN A COUPLE OF PARTS, BUT I THINK HE DID A GREAT JOB ON THE BOOK"
4,Clancy is growing old,"He is the dean of 'technothriller' but I think his creative juices are running a bit dry. I tried something different off the technothriller list here at Amazon that I hadn't seen before-- ATLANTIS by Greg Donegan. Talk about different-- I recommed it highly. Action with a different edge, not quite sure what to call it."
2,Lacks credibility of Clancy's other books.,"When I read this book I was very disappointed. It is just about a SWAT team that goes around Europe shooting bad guys. Big deal. Even worse, the plot (which I won't reveal here) isn't as chillingly plausible as those in Clancy's earlier works. It's not believable, it's just dumb. This book falls far below Clancy's usually high standards. It propably makes a better computer game than a book. You'll want to read it if you are a Clancy fan, but if not, read one of his earlier, and much better works."
3,"Pretty good book, but not his best.","Pretty good book, but not his best. The story is a little slow at times, but worth reading."
4,Great Present,"This gift hooked its' new owner the first time he read it. Adventure, well written espionage and keeping the attention are just some of his mentions. Obviously a plot and book to enjoy."
2,The Same Formula,"As a reader of all of Clancy's Jack Ryan books, I find Rainbow Six to be the latest in declining quality. The storyline was not creative and seemed to be an extension and rehash of the ebola storyline of the past. The overall research was fair and not up to the high quality of some of the first books, i.e., Hunt For Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin and Without Remorse. Troubling were the seemingly unprofessionalism idiosycncrocies of both the good guys and the bad guy. This book was definitely not up to the standards of Clancy's earlier books. I hope the next is back to his excellent researched and plotted books of the past."
2,Overlong and unoriginal,"Mr. Clancy is getting lazy. This novel comes across as an expensive, overlong, self-indulgent Mack Bolan yarn. The author basically rehashes actual terrorist events, especially the exploits of Carlos the Jackal and the PLO. The German terrorists who conduct the assault in Vienna are virtual carbon copies of actual Red Army Faction members.Another flaw with this story is the near-invincibility of the protaganists. Clancy's commandos are basically bulletproof, which eliminates much of the suspense inherent in such a tale. The only ""good"" guys killed during the book are tertiary characters at best. Clancy's vaunted penchant for realism is sorely lacking here. I recommend Clear and Present Danger for a more accurate portrayal of combat.If you're interested in stories such as these, pick up a copy of ""Blackhawk Down"" instead."
2,Not Good,"I just finished the book and I was disappointed. The realism of the plot, technology and the real-life type characters (that were hallmarks of his earlier books) have given way to story that is dumb. Not only are his books getting really fat --Tom: as a helpful hint, let an editor do some trimming-- but it is now populated by characters who are all super men, super dedicated and fighting to save the world on a just in time basis. While that formula may work for Robert Ludlum, it detracts from the believability that have made the earlier Clancy novels so entertaining, engrossing and keeps you eagerly waiting his next book."
3,Not exactly the clancy I like...,"Although I am a loyal fan of Tom Clancy I just had to put this book down. Why you ask? For one thing the book was just to drawn out, possibly if he had condensed the book a little more i would have liked it. It's also not as realistic as some of his other books, the terrorist plots are just to far fetched and the terrorist counterstrike team never seems to have anything bad happen to them. Overall I'll have to give this book ***"
2,"Give me a break-- reality check here, folks","I'm tired of people who know nothing of what it means to be in Special Operations writing about it-- and getting it wrong, time and time again. Clancy doesn't have a clue what the true spec-ops guy is and this book is the worst of his stuff yet. Hunt for Red October was good, but this-- the bad guys are such idiots a girl scout troop could take them down. And the good guys aren't. I served in the military because I believed in democracy not to be judge, jury and executioner. Even Dick Marcinko's stuff is better than this. Or check out Andy McNabb's SAS books. Or Bob Mayer's special forces series. Let's get is straight."
2,"Please, before this is released as a paperback...","...*somebody* needs to edit it for spelling and punctuation. The errors are glaring. It's distracting to read.And here's an idiom that is used too often: ""for him, killing is as automatic as zipping his fly after taking a leak."" Interesting the first time. Do we have to repeat it again and again?I always expect the best from Tom Clancy, and he should hold his editors to the same high standards.I remain an avid Tom Clancy reader."
1,"Slow paced, technically inaccurate story.","I had heard many people say that this was one of Clancey's best books. In reading it, it is a slow paced story with many technical innacuracys and one could take out a couple of hundred pages and not miss anything. Would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Terribly predictable and sadly one dimensional,"I have been a Clancy fan from the first time I picked up Red October. While his characters have always been two dimensional, the plots and action sequences have kept you glued to the pages and the story lines were never been predictable....until now. R6 bears none of the hallmarks we have come to expect from Mr Clancy. Instead it feely borrows from the plot lines of previous novels while the action sequences stumble along like a drunken sailor on a week long binge. This novel might have done better if his editor had been awake when it crossed his or her desk. We might have been spared the sophomoric moral pontifications and interminable political rant."
4,"Not his best, not his worst.","This is better than the OP-Center books, but not quite up to Hunt or Clear and Present Danger. At least there is quite a bit of action. If you like action, I recommend an author who was in special forces and writes about what he knows: Bob Mayer. Check out his books here at Amazon and treat yourself to one. I've read all six and enjoyed them all. I learned a lot about the way Special Operations forces operate while also having a good read."
4,Good page-turner -action right from the prologue,"Clancy has improved from recent books that had more brain-numbing detail than action. This book has some shortcomings, and the author's photo on the back of the book is sickening, but the story allows Clancy to insert sudden action-filled chapters that keep you moving. His best offering since Cardinal."
1,What a huge disappointment,"I used to like Tom Clancy's books. But it seems to me, and a lot of other people, that the newer stuff is just crap.Where do I start with this one? The characters were two dimensional, they heroes were more like superheroes that could do nothing wrong. The story if so repetitive it borders on funny. The villian is an oxymoron, he's the president adn CEO of a corporation, yet he's a tree-hugger. And to make it worse, he has an idea for world domination that looks more like something out of a bad James Bond movie. Then to top it off, Clancy obviously didn't do his research when he was writing, because he seems to have forgotten that when it's summer in the US and England, it's winter in Australia.Overall, the book is lacking and seems to be on the collapse of a once good writing career. If you want to read a book written by someone who knows how to write an anti-terrorism unit book and not as long, go get OMEGA FORCE: THE GHOSTS OF WAR."
2,Horrible-My last Clancy book.,"When I was a teenager, I burned through all of his early books in a few days, completely absorbed in the exciting military battles and intriguing political maneuvering. But it's clear that starting with this book, Clancy has run out of boogiemen. I'm an environmentalist, and although his topic of environmental terrorism didn't insult me, the bumbling, utopian narrative spewed by the disturbed tree-huggers did make me cringe. I remember turning each page, hoping, begging, to find something interesting to grab onto, but in the end it was a giant letdown. He started to lose it somewhere around Debt of Honor, but this is sure proof that he simply ran out of enemies. How much more Robby Jackson talking jive can you take? Or Ding spewing his East L.A. street-slang? The characters and plots are now cliches. Oh well-it was good while it lasted."
3,"Good, but . . .","Rainbow Six is an interesting read, but it's not up to the level of Clancy's previous work. John Clark and Ding Chavez are still great characters, and the insight into their family life is good, but the plot is sloppy and predictable, the anti-environmentalist stance is thrown in the reader's face ad nauseam, and the brutality of the situations, while necessary, is repetitious and eventually tiresome. I became thoroughly sick of the phrase ""splattered brains"" and its less than subtle variations. I am looking forward to the next book in the Jack Ryan universe, but I hope it's written with more care than this. Clark and Chavez are great, but bring back Jack!"
1,rainbow six,"This being the only Tom Clancy novel that i have read, i have to say i was greatly dissappointed. I found Rainbow Six an extremely predictable story of good guys versus bad guys. This book logged in at nearly 900 pages and yet the charactors were all one dimensional, the plot could be seen a mile away, and there were no suprises at all. The women, although educated, were incapable of comprehending the hard realities of the job the men performed - killing terrorist. Huh? The sexist nature of this novel portrayed women as liberal, pouting, drones best left to mothering children than worrying about politics. The vigilanty style justice at the end of this book was pure fantasy.On the positive side about this novel was, although way too long, it was a quick and easy read. The action was fast paced and rarely bogged down too much. My recommendation is that if you like this type of genre, you would be much happier reading anything by Robert Ludlum. His novels are far superior to Tom Clancy's."
3,Not worth putting in 900 pages of reading effort,"I liked the anti-environmentalist stance, all the cool medical stuff, Popov, and the part where Rainbow gets ambushed at the hospital. That was about it. There were a few other interesting action scences early on, but other than that, the book was about 400 pages too long, and the plot was poorly thought out. I agree with the other reviewer who thought the foiling of the bad guys' plan was WAY too easy. It was clear that the part at the Olympics should have been the climax, and that the novel should have ended shortly thereafter. But no, it drags on and a second attempt at a climax is made in South America (and failed). It was as if Clancy planned to have a big battle scene in Sydney, then realised it wouldn't work for some reason, but instead of thinking around the problem just glossed over it and kept writing. Not too bad a book, if you're just looking to kill time, but not one of the better books I've read."
1,"Obvious Plot, a typical TV-movie style script","I was very disappointed, the characters are dull and the plot was not what I expected from this ex-great author Tom Clancy."
1,A mediocre writer gets worse.,"It is unusual to see a thriller writer's talents decline so rapidly (Alistear MacLean also comes to mind), but the writer of such passable works as Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising is no more. Whether it is because of his interest in writing Rush Limbaughish right-wing drivel, or because he is paid by the weight of his books, he has managed to become a caricature of himself, much like the pose he affects for his picture on the back cover. The characters are unbelievable, the plot is labyrinthine, and the dialogue is sophomoric. Shouldn't there be a lemon law for books so we could get our money back? That's a rhetorical question; I read a library copy, thank goodness!"
2,"Engaging actions sequences, separated by 50 pages of drivel.","I've run into a first with a Tom Clancy book...usually, I'm interested that I literally hang on to every word, but in this one I've started to skip all the exposition scenes, in which the various eco-villains paraded their villany around in great tedium. Ah, yes, another page and a half of the Science Advisor thinking how much she hates all humanity. And now the researcher. And the hunter. And what feels like every one of the people who are involved in the project. The anti-environmentalist position started grating very early as well. The more I think of this one, the more I'm convinced that this one is going back to the bookstore tomorrow."
1,Is the plot the main character???,"The only character that I found remotly interesting in Rainbow 6 was the former KGB agent, and I don't think he was supposed to be the main character. I found the plot to be extremely predictable, anad at no time was I worried that the bad guys would outsmart the good guys.On the plus side, this novel was easier to get into then the last couple of Clancy's novels.In other Clancy novels, the plot has been strong enough to carry the lack of character development but this one wasn't."
1,Disappointing,This book really disappointed me. I've read all of Clancy's stuff except for his last couple and the Op-center series. Since it has been so long since his last one I was hoping this would be gripping. It's not. The plot could easily have unfolded in 290 pages rather than 740.
3,Somewhere Over The Rainbow......,"As a die-hard fan of Tom Clancy and his genre, I read every one of his real books. This one, while still a thrilling read, shows signs of a declining Clancy. The element of beleivability in this book is somewhat missing, and Clancy goes way overboard with the right-wing thing. Clark and the little bit of Ryan have lost their punch, and Ding is a bit too much like, say, James Bond? Clancy is way too anonymous and unspecific about the bad guys at first, and this book has Clancy's biggest flaw in full: A lousy ending. Unless Clancy stops trying to buy the Vikings, CEO his new company, and doing all this op-center stuff, his books may not be long for my world."
1,very mixed,"Interesting anti-terroist commando missions, and lots of them -- these parts will be read with pleasure, compulsively.But the book is fatally flawed -- bland villians, and a pathetically ludicrous MacGuffin...."
3,"A page turner, but a bit long.","I love Clancy's writing, with an abundance of technical details and swift, brutal justice for the bad guys. It seems that Clancy foresees actual world events as he is writing each book. Rainbow is an anti-terrorist task force and the week the book came out, there were two terrorist bombings in Africa. Too bad we didn't have a real ""Rainbow"" to go after the terrorist leaders as Clancy would have them do.The plot of Rainbow Six is a good one, with the task of saving the world (literally) upon John Clark's shoulders. A 20% edit in length would have made for a four star review. Some of the chapters were as routine and boring as the routine and boring training Ding remarks about."
3,NOT THE BEST THRILLER I READ THIS WEEK,"You want believable action-- read Joe Dalton's THE OMEGA MISSILE in paperback. It's cheaper than this tome and much better. Besides, Dalton is a former Green Beret who knows what he's talking about first-hand. This book was simply too long, too unbelievable. I liked Clancy's first books, esp Hunt For Red October but ----"
4,Americans are always brilliant...,"I wish Clancy would get off his high horse. Why is Rainbow full of Americans? British snipers have represented their country in the Olympics and won medals yet Clancy reckons they aren't good enough. He rightly points out that the Special Air Service Regiment is the best unit at Anti-terroism yet the force is made up of Americans who have had little experience in actual situations. Not a bad story, I bet the tree huggers have a go at him now. John Clark is the best character he has created, Ryan is such a goody goody. By any chance is Clancy Catholic, like his heroes, and Jesuit trained, like Ryan? Red Storm Rising, Sum of all Fears and Without Remorse are his best to date."
1,This is a terrible book.,"Tom Clancy should be ashamed of himself. Its' (too few) action scenes are suspenseful. The part of the book, however, that surrounds these minor sub-stories is absolutely lacking in plot, character development or focus. It's almost as if it were dictated as free-association , with little or no thought given to story elements beyond, of course , reaching (in as many unnecessary words as possible) Clancy's morally depraved ending."
1,This book is made for motion picture,"My anticipation has turned into disappointment. The first hundred pages seemed to be very exciting then it stopped. I find the book to be very long-winded... Instead of 740 pages, the book could have been cut to 540 pages. I am very disappointed. His best book is Clear and Present Danger. Would I recommend this book? No."
2,"Detail overkill for 700 pgs, then rushed & sparse end.","Clancy's last several books have been interesting reads, but not the well rounded efforts of Red October, Clear & Present Danger, and Without Remorse. When Clancy is on top of his game, you find the exhaustive detail-work of his lengthy set-ups to be fascinating and enhancing. It leads to a climax, a or series of them, that are equally detailed and thorough. When he's not, as in Rainbow Six (and his previous two efforts), the details are just formalities that come as Clancy-style literary baggage.I didn't throw the book down in anger when I finished it. But I was left with the feeling that the author had run out of energy and didn't want to devote the same attention to the books conclusion that he had to the massive text that preceded it, ... AGAIN!"
4,Clancy delivers another action packed thriller...,"Rainbow Six has everything one would expect from a Clancy thriller, so for Clancy fans, they shouldn't be disappointed... or should they? Clancy doesn't deviate much from his tried and true formula, so the book DOES prove to be a quick and exciting read. However, it isn't a stellar Clancy novel like Without Remorse or The Cardinal of the Kremlin. It is more along the lines of The Sum of All Fears or Debt of Honor. The premise of the book is fairly weak, but with the state of the world, who's to blame Clancy for choosing environmental terrorists? Clancy's novels have always been like Action movies, you're entertained while you're in it, but afterwords, you're just wondering what to have for dinner."
2,Not so good.,"I liked Tom Clancy's early books, _Red Storm Rising_, _Sum of all Fears_, etc. However, I was pretty disappointed with this book. It was interesting in places, but too formulaic. He tends to get lost when not speaking techno-babble - the character development is poor, there isn't alot of tension, etc. And long...way too long. It could use some serious editing. Has anybody else noticed how Clancy has started using the same phrases repeatedly in his books? For example, two or three novels ago he started using the phrase ""been there, done that"". Not just once, but many times per book. Rainbow Six has 3-4 ""been there, done that""s in it, several comparisons of the men on Rainbow 6 to ""lions"", that sort of thing. It is as though Clancy is writing each scene in his story outline, then just glueing them together. He needs an editor. Also, this book could have been written by Rush Limbaugh. Yeah, vegetarians are a pretty serious danger to the world."
4,One of Clancy's best!,"I admit I was a little disappointed when I first heard the new Clancy was not a Jack Ryan book, but reading the first chapter on line changed my disappointment to anticipation quickly. I had thoroughly enjoyed Without Remorse and Rainbow Six provides the same action and character development. I would recommend this book to any of my friends, even those sometimes intimidated by the length of a Clancy novel and assure them that this is one of the least ""technical"" of his novels with a story that moves quickly throughout.l"
3,Clancy strays from his strengths,"Rainbow Six started well, and had me engrossed for the first half of the book. But critical plot elements did not make sense, and the book simply fell apart at the end of the middle. Characters are not well developed, and the ending silly. All in all, not a strong effort from an author I usually like."
2,WHY BOTHER???????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This, this, thing! takes all the fun out of beyblading! I find building beyblades to be one of the best parts of all! you cant even customize it! Ive even seen a bey blade simular to this that actually makes music! BAD music!:-(:-(:-("
2,Buyer Agency Lite -- Let the Buyer Beware,"Definitely a respectable book for those who are looking to practice limited buyer agency.Those who are interested in functioning as true buyer agents would be better served by Ray Wilson's book, ""Bought, Not Sold"" though.Wilson's book deals with putting client interests ahead of all others, including that of the licensee's own. Harlan and Lyons, while the first on the scene to mass popularize the concept of buyer agency, have done so more as a marketing method, than as a representation first model.Harlan and Lyons's book is not threatening to the desire of traditional real estate agents to control and influence both sides of the transaction, which explains why they have had success in promoting their book on a wholesale basis.With them, it's about what is best for the licensee, not the client.Reviewed by Jay Reifert, Broker/OwnerExcel-Exclusive Buyer Agencyand Director of Operations for REAL-ReformReal Estate Agency Law-Reform"
3,Good timing.,The DVD were received in a good condition and the time it took for delivery was much shorter than antisipated.
3,a very big questionmark?????,"I really wished I had seen Amandla, but unfortunatly the RegionCode was not good. It would be interesting if you could do something about this problem. The nephew of my friend saw it via his computer (because he has a dvd-writer) and was very enthousiastic about the dvd. So let's say then 8/10"
4,Buy Amandla together with Sarafina,"My suggestion is that you enjoyed Sarafina, buy Amandla to learn more about the songs and dances of protest in apartheid era South Africa.While Sarafina was a musical, Amandla more of a documentary, and goes into much more detail of the history and origin of the songs. Commentators will discuss the songs in a round table kind of setting, and then you see examples of the songs. There's also a good section covering the origin of the 'toyi-toyi' dance step, which is prominent in the climax of Sarafina.At the same time, I don't see this as a useful video in learning the history of apartheid or even South Africa, as no mention is made at all of Coloureds and Asians, who also live in South Africa and were subordinated under apartheid, albeit less than Blacks. Rather, Amandla succeeds as a history of the songs of protest."
3,Amandla,I already received and this product is very good. I suggest for all people interest in anti-colonizing and politics action
5,Great advice; distilled to the essentials.,"I saw this guy on Oprah a few years back, and he got my attention with one line: when Oprah asked him iconoclastically: ""So, Ross, you think you know what women want..is that it?"" His taciturn reply was ""I don't care what women say they want, I only care what they respond to."" Sounds simple, but boy is this a lost concept! Jeffries boils it down to a concise and entertaining read, although in parts it's a bit unneccessarily graphic. This book will help the average joe stop being the ""social spare-tire"" for women and start being in control of his own sex life. Great stuff!"
2,Not nearly as good as his other products,"Let me tell you this. Ross Jeffries' Speed Seduction products are amazing. This book is NOT. If you want to get laid, get his home study course, (do a web search on Speed Seduction to find the site), or go to one of his seminars. This book is VERY outdated, and extremely incomplete."
2,Only the Buyer Gets Seduced,"Just in case none of you noticed, most of the positive reviews for this this book were written by Ross Jeffries! Notice the long, melodramatic reviews which drone on with lines like ""imagine yourself with the power to..."" Folks, I wish that his program did work, but I'm inclined to say that your luck will be the same as waving a stopwatch before someone's face & saying...""you're getting VERY sleepy!"""
2,Not Offended by the goals - Just don't think this works,"I read this book because I was hopeful that the more favorable reviews would be accurate. Coming off of a four year relationship and new to the dating scene, I thought this would be a helpful tool to ""get back in there."" I really was disappointed. This may or may not help people who are really shy or who never had any women, but for those of us whose success with women has not been terrible, this book is a waste of money and travesty. The author's main strategy is to ask women questions like ""What was your favorite vacation"" so that they will think of romantic feelings and want to have sex with you. It's very stupid and won't help a bit."
1,Ve-e-e-ry Interesting - but Stupid!,"1) Jeffries emphasizes (to put it mildly) the use of ""framing"" context and catchy terms and phrases. This same approach is preached in countless books and courses on how to conduct yourself in meetings, job interviews and submitting resumes - dare we see some connection here?2) In some context this is one man's answer to all those books by women on how to land a man. And just as intelligent.3) If you ever meet anyone sucker enough to be used by this approach, lose them or steer clear of them; they're not worth knowing. Before someone tries this on you, read Sheldon B. Kopp's ""If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him.""4) Jeffries' biggest selling point is his attitude; there has always been a market for it and always will be. On the whole, it's better this should advertise itself publicly than go underground - this way, we know where they are."
1,From a woman's point of view...,"If you are the kind of guy who has no real morals or conscience (and the woman will probably already sense this 10 minutes into a conversation with those of you who abide by this book) *and* your goal is to have the kind of relationship that lasts less than a week, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, lose the book and be yourself. Women want nice guys who *won't* use them for their body or affections. Women want men who can be their best friend -- not best lover. I have yet to know anyone who's ever said otherwise. And the one's who probably only want sex and nothing more are as riddled with problems and emotional baggage as the men who use them. This book is worthless to those of you who still believe that being a nice guy is the only real way to earn respect from women."
1,Absoloutely terrible!,"I don't know what kind of women Mr. Jeffries is dating, but anyone who has half a brain will recognize his feeble attempts at hypnotism. This book is good for a few laughs, nothing more."
3,Classic... not as good as the new material,"This is a classic work on seduction.If you study Ross Jeffries' materials... this is a bit primitive, but it is still useful.There are still very valuable understandings about pattern language, rapport, and quickly accelerating another persons state described in this book.Since this book, though, RJ has deepened his understanding of both patterns and state (inner game). He has also created much simpler ways to practice and learn quickly and easily.If you are just looking for a book to introduce you to the area, check outSecrets of Speed Seduction Mastery. It is a much more thorough introduction which also brings you up to speed on some advanced concepts as well.At the time it was written, this book was easily 5 stars. It is very dated, though... and there is much more advanced and simple material available now.keep smiling,Benjamin"
5,Simply excellent,"This book got me to get rid of all of my girl-pals and get a really good girl-friend. My self-respect has risen so much as a result of this book, not to mention the enriching effects of a healthy relationship, that I've gone from a so-so non-achiever to a take-charge master of my own life. The relationship worked out so well that we've been married now for five and a half years and have two wonderful sons and one on the way. There is no doubt that even this relationship would have fizzled away like all the rest (if it had started at all), if it had not been for this book.Anyone can read a book and wish that it will help, but you have to actually DO!! the exercises to get the results, which for me have been wonderful. I can't recommend this book highly enough, even to whiners.By the way, the heart of the book is self-respect. So, you can apply that to job interviews and other personal interactions, not just to dating women. This, too, has been rewarding."
2,Just the tip of the ice burg,"I bought this Ross Jeffries book because it was alot cheaper than his home study course. Well, there is a reason for that. This book in its time might of contained one or two good points, but now with sites like The Seduction Bible and books like Neil Struass's The Game this just doesn't offer anything fresh. Unless you are completely new to the game and this is the only book you can find, and you can't get online than skip this!"
4,Pretty Good Stuff,"Perhaps not the best book I've ever read regarding the material. The section regarding hypnosis is slightly far fetched. Somewhat out of date, yet nonetheless effective and insightful."
1,ross jeffries WORSHIPS THE DEVIL he is recruiting,he is recruiting people to worship satan...i did one of his other products...there were disgusting results...beware he really is a satan worshipor...be very careful..be aware..i am giving a warning to other people...he is dangerous...be careful..i wasnt..some bad things happened...try david deangelo... he is a lot better..
1,Futile Information about procuring Women,Possibly one the worst book choices out there. Ross Jeffries the self proclaimed master over women. Writes this completely ridiculous book. The truth is that Ross Jefferies is a great marketer-that is the true purpose of the book to sell nonsense that people would buy into. Then he could use the profits to sell more nonsense. Anyhow the book has some lame tips that most guys already know. The two sections on NLP and hypnosis are the most riduculous. I suppose this book would work on woman who had the IQ of a tomato. Other then that my advice is don't buy this book. A person who reads this book will know as much as the person who did'nt read it. Absolute literary garbage. Excellent work of fiction.
1,Fuel for humor,The only value this has is as a basis for conversation with a woman who has a sense of humor--both parties can probably get some good belly laughs.The fake reviews by the author here are pitiful.
2,Invest your money elsewhere,"Although the author makes a few good points this book isn't worth the purchase price. His hypnosis technique would probably work on women with IQs of less than 80 but who want's to hang around them? Also, the whole concept of pursuing women for sex alone seems too single minded."
1,save your money,"In one word, a scam. This is nothing but a pitch for additional ""systems"" by the author. Let me give you an example. One of the line he advocates is something like ""Hello you fine example of genetic perfection"". Would anyone in this day and age use such a line and what type of woman would respond positively tho this question? Nuff said. Save your $$$$."
1,Huge waste of money and time!,"I read, re-read, practiced, and made efforts on NUMEROUS occasions to seduce several different women using the techniques in this book and NONE of it worked."
1,"Fiction, pure fiction.","I can't believe that people honestly think that this can work. The book is funny and entertaining, but that's about all you'll get."
1,This book should be forbiden,Incredible how men can be manipulative. This book should be illegal. Who practices this is very selfish and deserves to be treated so as well.
1,how to get the woman you desire into bed,"Some things could be practical; read it if you have access to it. Better get ""50 Secrets To Pickng Up Girls"". That book is SO MUCH MORE practical; and I reccommend it because it is effective. Above all, to the point."
1,This is total B$,"Is this for Real? I wouldnt use this book to wipe myself with. It ranks right up there with drinkong acid, If you are looking for a laugh its good but it has no real information. And to top it off its done in VERY BAD taste."
1,Not worth the money,"Just to show that you can't judge a book by its title, this book promises a lot and delivers little. The premise is amazing; that you can walk up to some hot chick you've never met in a mall, get her to close her eyes and picture a delicious chocolate, and minutes later get her in bed. Nice fantasy, but it reminds me of the story about the guy who stands on a street corner asking every woman who walks past him to go to bed with him. 999 times out of a 1000 he gets slapped. Ross' advice is as practical as telling you to get rich by buying a lottery ticket; the odds are about the same.A far better book is ""how to date young women"" by R. Don Steele. Steele's methods are far more realistic (he doews not promise instant success) and by the way Steele's advice applies to all women, not just young women."
4,This book works for the attentive reader,"Ross could have been more complete in how to use Neurolinguistic Programming as a tool to date women. It would give other readers a better understanding of ""why this will work for you.""If followed -- Ross' advice does and will work -- not every time with every woman -- but it makes a positive difference."
3,Its alright,"this book has a very,very good ending and beginning, but the middle is a little shaky, although I could follow along because I have read many other books of this nature before, I would recommend this book to people who are advanced, rather then beginners.If you are advanced this book may be for you."
3,wasn't that impressed...,"yes ive seen all the episodes and played through two of the games, infection and mutation, and i found this anime series obnoxiously flat with a very slow moving plot. the soundtrack to the series is wonderful along with the artwork but i found the story to be non-gratifying in any way shape or form for me.granted i watched the horribly translated sub version from japan it probably wouldnt be fair for me to really recommend .hack// or not, but to take caution and rent a few of the volumes before investing money on purchasing them, unless of course your a die hard .hack// fan :P"
3,I love it but....,I bought this series to add to 1-4 that I already own. I love .hack//sign but when I got this the cd's were not in the package. Why would someone send me the empty outer casing for the cd's but not the cd's themselves? I'm puzzled!
1,Wrong Goods Received,Well it is Jan. 19 and I am still waiting to receive the correct item ordered Hack Vol. 5. The supplier shipped me Vol. 4 and although I have contacted them on several occasions both through and outside of Amazon.com channels I have yet to receive the correct DVD. My credit card has already been charged for this item and I have yet to receive the correct item supposedly shipped on Jan. 4. Dissatisfied Customer.
2,Not worth it!!!!!!!,"This seems like a great deal with the amount of material and the price, but the truth is ""cheap price, cheap recordings"" . I highly suggest if you want to get the most of Richard Strauss's tone poems you should buy different recordings. The main thing I was disappointed with on this box set was the recording of An Alpine Symphony. The recording of the alpine symphony was too old and weak, sloppy and loud (only at times),and just ok overall. The alpine symphony is on the first cd so I after I listened to that, I had a bad attitude about the rest of it. Even though, all of the other recordings are pretty good or ok.Personally, I would suggest Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic when it comes to Richard Strauss's tone poems."
5,very eye opening,"Although it may take time for the codependents eyes to adjust to the light, this book does a great job of illuminating the issues that many of us face in a way that changes the way you view everything, reading this book really made me face some things that until now I had not looked at. It pointed me in the direction of true healing. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is experiencing feelings of emptiness or feeling like they are lost."
5,A Great Tool for Self Exploration,This book is a godsend. It provides a very solid foundation toward understandingjust what codependency is and how it affects one's life over time. It is a greattool and provides just the awareness needed to move toward healing. Very well done.
2,"""Would a full frontal massage help calm you down?""","Lame wannabe T & A comedy (missing the T & A and for the most part the comedy) about three middle-aged dorks who hire a beach stud to help them ""pull some tasties"". Yea, that's a alright premise for a movie (it worked for HARDBODIES!), but my number one problem is: why on the video that I watched when Portia Dawson took her top off a black oval with ""censored"" written on it covered her breasts!? Other girls got topless...briefly, but as soon as a topless scene shows up that's longer than one second it's censored!? What a rip-off! Is it that way on the DVD also?To give you an idea of what you're in for John Quinn also directed CHEERLEADER CAMP and HOT CLUB CALIFORNIA."
1,Woweee!,I've seen bad movies but I'm not too sure I've ever seen one this bad! Thanks be that there are no special features. I can just imagine the crew patting themselves on the back (as they usually do) for making this drivel. This is the type of movie they should have to pay YOU to suffer through!
4,Good first documentary,"This film is the first documentary of Jamie Johnson, made for his college thesis. What is interesting about the movie is how few places there are for heirs to really dig in and talk about their money and how it affects them and how to reconcile their values and emotions about it. I believe that the movie shows how Jamie attempts to struggle with important issues about inherited wealth and how little help he truly gets with his need to resolve these questions and feelings from his family and his family's advisers."
2,Nothing to hold it together,"Great, rich kids are people too. This is what this movie is supposed to show, but instead it shows that rich kids are naive and full of themselves."
5,Sometimes a lonely life - Born Rich,"After watching Born Rich on cable, I knew I wanted it on DVD so that my children and grandchildren could watch it. I felt sad for the ""kids"", sometimes they led a very lonely life, no responsibity and not knowing who their real friends were. We all wish we were rich but now I am thankful that we work for our money, have wonderful friends who like us for who we are and not what we can do for them and enjoy life because we are a part of it. I would reccommend this DVD to everyone who has not seen it."
3,interesting,"From the reviews I expected the most despicable group of kids, but I didn't really get the hoopla about what made them despicable. Other than the magnitude of their expenses, I didn't see how any of them were different from middle class suburban kids who spend too much time at the mall.The drug addict, the guy who talks crap, the fencing geek, the playboy, the girl who likes to shop. If this movie was about the lives of suburbian kids, would the truths behind their comments be any different?The posturing and foot-in-the-mouth moments seemed more to me about young adults than about the wealthy. I think a more entertaining movie would have been to delve into the world of wealth, the class structure, the incestuous social circles and dating rules."
3,Good Introduction to the Rich Lifestyle,"This video is a great example of why we should stop to examine the myth of meritocracy that circulates within American Culture. Some of us achieve great accomplishes in live, but as Jamie Johnson points out, some people are simply born with more opportunity than what they know how to handle."
1,why is this movie still around?,"I haven't seen anything this bad since the Lone Ranger! Plot: greedy man kills prospector, Lassie kills greedy man. What's the point? There are plenty of other Lassie movies far better than this one."
2,"Enjoyable Lassie flick, despite marginal video quality","Magnificent scenery, reminds me of my vacations out west with my parents, when I was young. The video is of extremely poor quality, though. Could be very distracting during certain parts of the movie. If you are sensitive to video quality issues, you won't like it. Otherwise, enjoy!"
4,The Painted Hills,"This DVD is a treat for Lassie fans both young and old. The scenery is spectacular, and the story line was well written. I would highly recommend this film to everyone."
1,pointless,"No analysis, and random diagrams, I found the book useless. It did contain a record of the actual moves however."
5,Subarashii = Wonderful,"After living in Kyoto, translating on both coasts and searching the globe for an authentic material with which to teach my child Japanese, I found it. Unlike Bilingual Baby which takes place entirely within American settings, this is the first CD to use hiragana, Japanese nursury rhymes, and wonderful scenes to accompany the lessons. My child asks for this CD a couple of times a day!! Truly they have gone where no one has gone before but where's International Baby 102, 103, etc.?"
3,"Good Writing, Difficult Reading","The writing was magnificent in its prose, but very difficult reading. I found it hard to get absorbed in the actual life of Cezanne - and maybe it's because his was a relatively uneventful life, so it had to be elaborated upon - and sometimes felt as though I was actually reading a biography of Zola. The style of inserting massive passages of quotes just threw me off a bit because just when it felt like I was flowing with it, there came another big, long passage from the sources. I can understand that there was a lot going on all AROUND Cezanne during his life, but I would have preferred to get more into his mind instead of trying to explain things through others' experiences at that time."
4,Not enough,"Our daughters love the TV show, so we decided to get this DVD. As to the quality of the video/audio, 5 stars. Now we thought it would be a 96-minute movie, but it was actually ""just"" four episodes from the TV, which they had already seen. The chapters are great, but not enough. We'd like to see more episodes coming, even better if it was in a single DVD."
5,OH YES TO numediaman2 on...........,"the Jackie McLean sonics!!All OUT on that,man!! And... just wondering what quality pressings those Spanish issues are?Prolly sound like cr*p?YES- shame we don't have more Tina.ANOTHER American Great,totally upwelling himself way too soon.And then Clifford Brown...........like jazz."
4,A very nice monitor,"I went to a local electronics store to look at LCD Monitors. They had approx. 10-15 displayed with the same desktop picture. This monitor was the best picture out of them all, even compared to some higher priced models. In fact I asked the salesmen what his most popular selling monitor was and he said Princeton graphics followed by Sony and Samsung. He said he felt the PG monitor had the best picture of them all. And I agree! A very nice monitor for the money. Speakers are not very good though. very tinny sounding. I would say that the picture on a CRT monitor is definitely better. but this LCD is actually pretty good too.It was also nice to regain some desktop space!! You won't be disappointed!"
2,Prima's Bushido Blade 2 Strategy Guide is a disappointment,"The Bushido Blade 2 strategy guide is not up to the high standard of Squaresoft's excellent game. Moves are not always attributed to the proper characters, the biographies of the characters are mostly badly written filler that you'd get from a quick run through of the game,the screenshots are too dark and too small to be of any real use, and the few character renders that are included are often overlaid with other graphics or charts that don't add much to your knowledge of the game itself. Minimal information, no bios and no pictures aside from more useless screenshots are included of the final boss characters despite the fact that this information would help clarify the game's storyline. This strategy guide is the only one available for Bushido Blade 2 but interested games should approach it with caution."
4,Inside Super MAX,This movie was interesting and I recommend it to anyone who has questions on prison life or life as a CO.
3,Sybille's Saga,"I'm plowing my way through the Sybille Bedford collection of writings and this one happened to be next on the list. I've become quite fond of her peripatetic style of writing, weaving the semi-autobiographical stories among the well written travelogue of the 30's. Compass left me disappointed, unfortunately.The story was somewhat repetitive of some of her earlier books, an autobiographical rehash. It did give some insight into the direction her libido was taking her as a teenager, alluding to the passion of her affairs with strong, older women. She might have elaborated more on this aspect of her awakening but perhaps felt constrained by her generational decorum.For the Sybille Bedford devotees this is a must read; all others may want to take a pass."
3,A little too technical for me.,"I bought this book hoping for a general introduction to the explosion, its causes and its aftermath. The book does contain such information, but it's buried underneath a heavy layer of technical detail that can be, at times, mind-numbingly boring. Unless you are a nuclear engineer or otherwise interested in the minutiae of the reactor's workings, I'd skip this book."
3,Is there really No Breathing Room?,I thought this was a very good novel. I used this on several occations as a document for research papers I have wrote on the subject of Nuclear power and Chernobyl. The author is very accurate and shows the world what goes on behind the scenes.
3,"Dr. Dirty, plain and simple.","I bought this dvd the last time I saw John Valby live, and was lucky enough to have it autographed. After one of the craziest nights of my life, filled with more laughs than ever, I was sure to pop this one in as soon as I got home.I must first then caution you, that this DVD does not compare to seeing John live. In fact, none of his albums do. Though his show is simple, just good old Dr. Dirty and a piano, being a part of the crowd is a must. Why then, do you ask, would you buy this dvd?Well, for starters, it's a great look inside of a Dr. Dirty show, and gives you a taste of John, and the crowds are there to see him. Sure, its poorly recorded, but who cares? It's Dr. Dirty. Plain and Simple.If you've seen John live, then you'll love this dvd, as its filled with some of his best. If you haven't, then watch the dvd, study it, and start learning the words so you can participate when you go see him!"
2,Disappointing,Die hard fans of John Valby will probably want this in their DVD collection - there don't seem to be many other live DVD's produced. The video and sound quality on this production suck! As previously mentioned it looks like it was filmed using a Micky Mouse Video Cam. The video quality is worse than VCD and the sound is terrible. Not recommended for anyone except those that absolutely have to have a keepsake remider of his shows.
5,Great,"Saw him years ago in Erie, PA was the funniest concert I have ever been to. Glad I found this item."
4,Very Good Scenario,"This novel, the latest in Clancy's series, is very well written save for the fact that he goes into a bit too much detail at times. It is a great novel for anyone who wants a book that they will be reading for sometime, and especially for fans of the Jack Ryan series. The last section of the book is particularly suspensful and Clancy really well portrays the internal politics of the communist Politburo in China."
2,Too far along to quit,"After about 600 pages, I realized that I was not having any fun reading the book, but I was too far along to quit. Clancy's best novels (Red Storm Rising and Clear and Present Danger to name two) were filled with action and suspense, not chapter long diatribes about such issues as abortion, population control and domestic politics. I see that Clancy is trying to move in a different direction with his writing, but it just comes of as contrived and preachy. Until he returns to his former style, I will be passing on all his future books."
2,CHINESE WATER TORTURE,"I found this book impossible not to put down.In many of his recent books Clancy has been in serious need of a ruthless editor,but never more than in ""The Bear and the Dragon."" There was so much fluff and extraneous material that I found it impossible to follow -- or eventually to care about -- the story line.Even worse,readers are continuously subjected to gratuitous doses of Clancy's political views.Do we really care in the context of the story about President Jack Ryan's views on abortion or social security? A good editor could have shortened this tome by several pages without damaging its content one iota.Then,perhaps we could have decided whether there is enough to the real story to make it interesting and entertaining.Unfortunately,we will never know. Instead,we are stuck with a cast of familiar characters who are no longer interesting or even credible and a world that is impossible to care about."
1,A farce,"THis book has a scenario that is so unreal, it borders on bad military science fiction. RUssian in NATO, China invading Russia. Right. What's next, flying saucers come to the rescue in part 2, where the secrets of Area 51 are finally revealed by Clancy. THere was once a time when Clancy wrote good books, but his latest, if indeed he does write them himself, are getting worse and worse. Which is apparently okay, becasue somehow they still end up on the best seller lists."
2,He crammed 200 pages of information into 700 pages of type.,The first 700 pages were mostly boring - developing each character way too much. All kinds of subplots that have little or nothing to do with the main book. If I didn't have a lot of time on my hands following surgery I would have put the book down long ago. Don't waste your money on this one.
4,The Bear and the Dragon,I have been a Clancy fan for years and thought the character development was a good carry on from his previous work. I enjoyed the storyline.
2,LONG STORY,"I do really like Clancy !!!That being said - I often find my self simply skip 2-5 pages without reading in this book, GOD his tells this story slow and very ""proud of his country"" like.This book is Clancy at his slowest - and that is sad since this is one of his better plots in my opinion. Wasted in all his rhetoric.Morten"
2,"Good story, with some technical problem",Two-page spread view does not work with Kindle for Mac.The cover page do not download.The story is...Well...by Tom Clancy:)
1,Written without research on the part of the author,"Overlooking the blatant sexism and racism. I have to wonder where Clancy got his information on Chinese/Russian society, military and economy. Perhaps he was passed some recently declassified documents from the 1950s and no one clued him in to newspapers and the internet in 2000."
1,Exhuming McCarthy,"While Tom Clancy definitely has got all the numbers present for another over-the-top action novel, this is all paint-by-the-numbers ... And though most of his books have had the scent of the Red Scare in them, this book reeks of it. It reads at times like some sort of late '50s pamphlet, save that it's over 700 pgs. long, but the real question is why? Why take a story brimming with all sorts of intrigue, and pile on this unnecessary, and despite the author's attempts, wholly irrelevant 'Gee, Stalin was bad' material - the amount of it, and sacrifices of flow and plot to insert it are, quite simply, baffling. I've found watching the Jack Van Impe show to be much mroe rewarding than this."
1,Racist and total waste of time,"I've read every Clancy novel featuring Jack Ryan, and I like all of them until this one. Yes, I know this is only fiction, but since Clancy cares so much about little details, shouldn't he at least create a world that looks like the one we live today? His idea about China and Chinese people seems to stay in the 1980's, and they're so stereotyped that it could only be called racism. Did he spend time to even study China and it's people? I think not. Also, his idea about economics are just plain stupid. He thinks that $100bln is such a large amount of money that it would somehow save Russia's economy. Do you know that $100bln is about what Russia gets from selling crude oil this year? A compleate waste of time and money!"
1,"TC, please pay attention","I don't expect this to be read, but I have to agree with all the previous die-hard fans (have to go out and buy the book the same day of release). I've never come here to read a review of TC before, his quality was always high. I came here just to see if I was the only one with this sense of disappointment. Not by a long shot - too long (or too thin on story line), too many phrases repeated immediately afterward by another character, an enemy that never had a chance to be a good villian, and an ending that befitted a 60 minute TV program - the list is very long and casts doubt who is writing/editing his work.I will return here before I buy my next Clancey novel."
3,Stop whining,"OK, so this isn't a masterpiece, though some of the reviews written go too far. In writing as he did about the Chinese, Clancy can be viewed as racist, or afraid of foreigners, or a bigot, or a whatever. I belive what Clancy did, however, was to create an 'Us vs. Them' scenario...just as in every Clany novel. Other than the obvious terrorist action and the middle east conflict, the world seems to be without a serious, global threat. Because he'd just written about terrorism (somewhat) and Iran/Iraq (though it looks as though he wants to stay away from the Israel situation), Clancy had to create a ""Bad Guy."" And, obviously, Clancy chose China to wear the dark hat.One problem with his most recent novels has been finding something to write about. He has, in fact, had to manufacture evil recently. When looking at the story as a manufactured ""Us vs. Them"" scenario (just as in Rainbow Six), it really isn't all that bad...of course, it does have its repetitions."
1,Clancy should stick to military and technical matters,"I will keep this brief - unlike Clancy.This book is the worse book that I have read from Tom Clancy.The characters are pretty one-dimensional. The Chinese in particular seem to have no saving graces. The book has a fairly racist characterization of the Chinese, in general.Filled with pointless sex.Extremely repetitive. How many times can he refer, for instance, to ""sausage""?Clearly, expouses a very-right wing political view point that would never work were these characters actually running the country in reality.He should stick to his strengths and talk about miltiary technology issues as he has done in his best books: Red Storm Rising and Red October. This book was a complete waste of time."
1,Tom Clancy gets worse by the day,"i have always been a fan of his earlier books but it seems that tom clancy is losing his touch. it seems that his vocabulary is limited to the few f words and those lousy, lousy really lousy sex stuff... if you want to read tom clancy read his earlier books. he should go sell his insurance instead of writing books that are full of stereotypes. had there been things such as -5 stars, i would think that he fully merits it. too bad the minimum bar is a star. i wonder who send it to the bestseller list. i must have been one of those blind fools."
3,Gratuitous use of the F word,"AS others have said, the book could have been shorter. It seems that the luster of Clancy's previous books has been replaced with the need to throw in a handful of profanity and an occasional limited sex scene.If this keeps up, the dialogue will become something akin to that of the Rogue Warrior series by Dick Marcinko!"
4,"a little long, but worth the effort...","This book confirms Clancy's status as one of the best writers of political-techno fiction around. Yes, it was long, very long, but I thought that the highly-involving story and interesting characters made up for the somewhat slow pace of the novel (that has been complained about below ad nauseum). I disliked the writer's strong moral bias towards America and against the Chinese, and the way that everything runs perfectly for the Americans (""the underdogs"") while the Chinese stumble at every opportunity. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the relationships between the characters as well as the unusual scenario that is presented by Clancy as having the potential to cause a nuclear war."
2,I drifted,"I have never drifted as much with any other book. Meaning I would start reading, and while I'm reading I would think about other things. I drifted! The novel should have been condensed to about 600 hundred pages.Recommend....The library, even if you have to wait for weeks."
3,was slow in getting my interest,"The book could have been cut in half and been more interesting. It was slow in getting to the story. There were so many characters to keep track of that it took a while to sort them out. Jack Ryan is the president who sounds like he really doesn't like his job, which is contrary to what I have seen in the election battles which we have seen over the years. We have Russia which has discovered a huge oil field in Siberia and gold, another big find. We have China who wants it, the United States who is trying to help Russia (which is just the opposite of what we have seen in years, the U.S. trying to build and strengthen Russia, the very country we have been opposed to all these years?). The greed I can see, in fact, right now, we are in a war fighting for oil, so it just doesn't ring true. The book was so-so and I can't really say I would recommend it. This doesn't mean that I wouldn't read another of his books because I would, because he has written some great ones."
3,Not Clancy's best,"As Tom Clancy novels go this one isn't up to muster. It lacks the mystery, intrigue, and surprize that Clancy is known for.Clancy books usually start you out down one path for a while and then you find out that this was just the setup for the main story. This book doesn't do that at all. The end of the story is anticlimactic as well.The other strange thing I noticed was a distinct repetition in phrases. This may be a literary 'feature' but it sure felt out of place to me.This book is not bad but not worth the full cover price. Try it at a discount or better, used."
2,A true disappointment,"This book is not up to standards clancy used us to. It is less gross than sum of all fears, but still, at points it is even boring. Strong language to fill a content vacuum and repetitions are common. Rayan is not the pleasant character he used to be - he has become arrogant and pretentious. A true disappointment."
1,sheer disappointment,"Is it me or do publishing houses no longer employ people to read books for typos and plot and character inconsistencies??? I've read all of the Jack Ryan books - until this one, I loved them all. I couldn't get more than 100 pages into this one due to the errors. Sorry, Tom - great stories, NO editing!!!"
1,Putrid...,"Bear and Dragon is an utterly horrid piece of .... I'm a long-time Clancy fan, but, if this is the best he can do nowadays, he should retire from writing fiction. A single ""star"" is far too high a rating for this .... Amazon's rating system should allow negative numbers for ""books"" such as this. Ick."
1,Filled with four-letter words,"I stopped reading this book after about 100 pages. Clancy (whom I thought was right-leaning) apparently cannot go 4 or 5 pages without using the ""s"" word or the ""f"" word. Even Jack Ryan regularly uses the latter (did he do that in the previous books? I don't think so). Tom Clancy has sold out."
2,TERRIBLE,"I have read all of Tom Claney's books and really have enjoyed them. I did feel that he was giving too much detail, but I managed to get passed that. The Bear and the Dragon was just terrible. Entirely too much detail and too many people to remember. 1200 pages, he could have written a book with half that amount of text and it probably would have been better. I won't rush out to buy another hard cover first edition of Claney's until I have read some reviews."
2,Time for Jack Ryan to retire,"This is not one of Tom Clancy's best. Jack Ryan's inner dialogue gets very tiresome after the third or fourth time. One of the biggest elements missing form this book is the element of surprise. In his past books, we didn't know what was the master plan that connected all the characters together. In this book, you know from the get go. I think it's time to retire Jack Ryan and move on to a new main character.Wait for the paperback if you are a die hard Clancy fan."
1,enough,jesus i realize clancy is a worker but this is pitiful he acts like americans are perfect and everyone else is incompetent. i wonder how he would write this election for bush . this book reads as if he got carried away with his own cosed mind and realized he had to dedicate a whole 75 pages to a war between superpowers to me this is sad but it must be nice to know you dont have to deal with the little people on the way to the bank i wonder what his ex has to say about this arrogantjerk
2,Bloated,What a sad slide from The Hunt for Red October. Crisp narrative has devolved into opinionated blather. I had to buy the Audio version to bridge me through the middle 400 pages until the battle sequence. Editor needed!
2,Perfect example for why writers need editors,"Clancy's written some fabulous books. Some of the great elements of his previous successes remain in Bear and Dragon, especially his (apparent) insider's knowledge of intelligence and military tactics and equipment. Even if half of these aren't real, they're interesting nonetheless.It appears, however, that given his significant success, Clancy has little if any editorial oversight. This should have been a 300-400 page book, not 1100+ pages. The same positions and points of view were made repeatedly. In some cases, the spoken phrases and thoughts were repeated verbatim, sometimes by different characters.Further, the ""good"" characters just aren't that interesting -- none are given any appreciable faults or inner conflicts do deal with. The end felt so rushed you'd think Clancy had run out of paper.Its disappointing, but this will be my last Clancy novel."
1,The original gimp has lost steam,"Mr Clancy's books have never been short, and the paperback edition I have of this one numbers 1137 pages (and this reader's head spins...). His initial production was at least made palatable by the display of a mass of fascinating technological knowledge of weapons and weapon-systems (and thus was the term ""techno-thriller"" born...) brought to us ignoramus-es, which even made the use of a forest of never-heard-before acronyms acceptable. In the progress of his production, we have been presented with divagations into politics and finance but, above all, with an increasing verbosity. ... Mr Clancy's production seems to be growing inflated, overfed, plethoric and hypertrophic, just as his physical appearance on the TV interviews he gives. He must have felt himself a decline in his readership's interest, if he resorted to introducing into his writing that old and stale ingredient, the torrid herotic scene...."
1,Ridiculous,"Interesting concept: How would the world react to enormous gold and oil reserves being found in Siberia.The problem is that the book makes things so much simpler than the world really is. Every American is Clancy the corny hero. And every Chinese character is the bad guy who 'hates those greedy Americans who try to control us, because we are the superior race'.Of course this is just supposed to be one long (1137 pages) roller coaster of action, and is fiction after all. It is just that the treatment is so unfair and the stereotyping is taken to the absurd lengths that one would expect of a farce, not a serious thriller.My point is if you are setting a novel in real places like China and America at least try a little to represent the actual complexity of these places. If you're not going to, then rather make it sci-fi and set it in a made-up world."
2,Quite verbose,"I have been a fan of Clancy's for many years and have read all the Jack Ryan and John Clark novels. This one ranks near the bottom, just above Sum of All Fears. Six to seven hundred pages should be enough to tell almost any story. Ryan and Clark need to retire so Clancy can find a new story line. As Shakespeare said, ""Brevity is the soul of wit."" Unfortunately, this one isn't witty at all."
1,Clancy at his worst...?,"The Bear and the Dragon was, by far, Tom Clancy's poorest attempt to revive the techno-thriller genre. Nine hundred and fifty pages of build-up to a conflict which is superficially resolved in the last one hundred pages is not the way maintain a devoted following. Even the last line of the novel (a crass reference to ""Japanese sausage"") is apt to leave a bad taste in the reader's mouth."
2,A Clancy Disappointment,"Clancy answered Martin Greenberg in The Tom Clancy Companion that he didn't think The Hunt for the Red October would sell because ""the book didn't have any sex in it.""Clancy proved with the subsequent nine books that he could sell books without sex in them. Yes, there was a section in Executive Orders that very strongly implied Cathy and Jack Ryan going to bed to have sex, but the passage was minimal and was between a husband and wife.In his latest book, Clancy has stooped to the level of discussing the sexual affairs between the main character, Chet Nomuri, and his information source. It's the type of ploy I would expect from a cheap romance novel, but not from Clancy.Clancy continues to weave multiple subplots into a good story, but it's unfortunate he felt compelled to include such a strong sexual element in The Bear and the Dragon."
4,This was much better than the reviewers on this site say,"Many people have said that Mr. Tom Clancy has become a little long winded and not quite as good a writer as he was a few books ago. I am not saying that I disagree with this, because I haven't read any of the books newer than this, but what many have said is that this is where he started his downhill drop. I must completely disagree with this. Though it is not a full 5 star novel like some of his others, it still gives us what is expected from a Clancy novel, thrills, suspense, and political thinkings. This is much better than most of the reviewers on this site have given it credit for. I just think that people are just wanting a way to discredit Clancy's greatness, which should not be allowed. This is a very big 4 out of 5.Thank you"
4,Tom is the best.,"I'm a fan of Tom Clancy, I like his writing and his techno-thriller style. This book is so good you cannot stop reading. Greetz,"
5,Naysayers?,"I could not agree less with the other reviewers. Seldom in my 70 years have I finished a novel with such regret. I thought it was dynamic, suspenseful and well written. Further, it subtly points to the fallacy of our Clinton administrations $30 billion per month trade deficit. It is tantamount to Roosevelt allowing all of our scrap iron to be sold to the Japanese in the 30's so they could melt it and create weapons with which to shoot back at us! The Chinese are a wonderful people. The Communist dictators who run that wonderful country are not. Wait and see!"
1,"Boring, too Long, Short on Story, Lots of Whining","Gosh, after 450 pages I was bored to death. Still no story, plot-line just a bunch of ""gee- why am I president"" muses by the main character. It did get better after page 500 - but the remaining book was a rehash of earlier books. Nothing interesting here. Wait for another author - Clancy is just milking the reputation he built (deservedly on his first 6 novels). His last two books shows he's past his prime."
1,disappointing,"Save your money and re-read Red October if you must have a techno-thriller. This is bad stuff, with stereotyped Chinese villains, unlikely scenarios even for him, leaden prose, and reactionary politics. Not that his decline as a writer really matters, with movie deals and games to keep the money flowing in."
2,Where was Congress during all of this?,"So the tenth out of ten missiles hits the ICBM that's about to plug D.C., and what does JR do? He invites the crew of the missile cruiser to his house for a party. What a great denoument! Clancy has always been a fun read (except for the execrable Patriots) and he managed to pull me through all 1000+ pages of this one, but mostly out of curiosity over whether ANY of our new weapons systems would fail. I could overlook the right-wing hyperbole on almost every page and the repeated wisecracks; the profanity was a pain in the neck, but I've seen worse. But, having had several PRC students in my classes, I really wonder about the irresponsible characterization of these people that underpins the whole plot. Chinese political leadership may not be as enlightened as we would hope, but they are not as stupid as Clancy portrays them. We would be stupid to think so..."
3,Clancy gave up too soon!,"The first Clancy novel that I read was ""Red Storm Rising"". I became hooked and read everything that he put out after. This book started out ok, but it seemed as if he just ran out of ideas and then ended the book. I love America winning as much as the next person, but this easily? Come on, now! Book could have been shorter and a little bit more realistic. Everything seemed to fall right into place, instead of wicked plot turns like the ending of ""Without Remorse"" (his finest novel in my opinion). I agree with the person that said that he needs to end the Jack Ryan series. Jack is old and boring. If he wants to keep with some of the old characters, maybe he could write a book about Clark's exploits in Vietnam. Now that would be interesting."
2,What happened to the reasearch?,"I'm not even going to get into the problems I had with the characters racist traits (which they never had against the Japanese in previous books) or with Clancy's politics (liberal, conservative, whatever - it was annoying, and it would've been annoying even if I agreed with him).One of the things that made Clancy stand out was his attention to detail - now he's just mailing it in. He misspells the name of China's third most important city several times (like misspelling Chicago), he has people in Beijing using Cantonese slang (Cantonese is spoken only in Southern China), and he has people in Beijing calling each 'comrade' - especially odd when you consider that in current China 'comrade' is how homosexuals refer to each other now in the PRC. What happened to your research TC?And I'm not even going to mention the awful way the plot dragged on - I'll go back and read 'Clear and Present Danger' - thanks."
2,Is there an editor in the house?,"There's 300-400 pages worth of book here, max. The rest is either pointless or exists only to provide a pulpit from which Clancy may espouse his political views. Some of the writing is downright sloppy. It reads as if Clancy was getting paid by the pound and forgot to run it by an editor."
2,disappointing and in bad need of a editor,"If you're expecting a ""Ryan as President"" novel to stand with the first two, you're going to be mistaken. The good start is thrown away as the next 300+ pages ramble exhaustively - and pointlessly as tho Clancey gets paid by the page. Where were the editors?? Do we REALLY need to read page after page of Ryan's thoughts on why he hates being President or Noumouri's thoughts on seducing a secretary? No. 19th century novels are models of concision by comparison. He also much have discovered the word ""f**k"" since he uses it at every opportunity. As Clancey's vocabulary atrophied along with his creativity? It appears so.Bottom line: don't waste your money. If you MUST HAVE this novel, it should be on the clearance tables by Christmas."
4,800 pages of superb Clancy...,"...however the book is over 1,000. It seems as if there were two Toms writing here, one with the exceptional movie-in-your-mind action and tight plotting of the first books but often another who repeats previously used quotes and comments and who uses an annoying quantity of dialog expletives (mostly the same anglo-saxon one) to fill space. One would at least expect the Russians and Chinese to use ethnic epithets.Further, some of the technology does not ring quite true. Even though it is all gee-whiz, it is today gee-whiz and not post-2000 gee-whiz with the assumption that both the Russian and Chinese intelligence community have been asleep the whole time and that their information security and compromise detection is non-existant.Still a steady read and lasted nearly four days. Despite apparently being proofread by a machine, when it was good, it was very, very good..."
2,Sounds like most people are on the same page . . .,"Came back to alert potential buyers to serious flaws in this latest Clancy work, but it looks like most of it has already been covered. Seems like Clancy was rushing to meet a deadline and didn't give his editors a chance. Plot lines that go nowhere. Characters (the few new ones) that never get developed. Most importantly, about 400 pages too long (take them out of the first 600). Obviously no one had time to proofread as the book is literally rife with typos, misspells, and tourtured constructions.If you are a Clancy fan like me, you'll buy it and read it anyway, but I hope enought people don't that he gets his act back together for the next one."
2,Horrible Waste of a Tree.,"""Quantity has a quality all its own"" is a phrase repeated often in this book. Clancy seems to have taken it to heart in producing this 1100+ page work. There is a decent story here, but it is buried in hundreds of pages of political, economic, and social commentary that tends to be to the right of Rush Limbaugh.There are at least 5 stories in the book...all of which are strung together with only the weakest of links. The same jokes are repeated endlessly, and while they are funny the 1st time, you tire of them after the 3rd. The familiar cast of Clancy characters is trotted out, some just to make cameo appearances. All these different people might as well be the same as they mostly share the same views and beliefs.There is decent suspense and the mechanical magic we've come to expect from ""technothrillers"", but only the most diligent reader will reach the payoff. Whatever gift Clancy had earlier in his career seems to have left with ""Clear And Present Danger""."
2,The worst dialogue of any book...,"As usual the action and setup of the book were good, however you really have to get through the inane and assinine dialogue. I can't believe there was actually a line in the book in which the the VP of the US actually says ""You can bet your bippy..."". And I'm sure the next Clancy book, he'll have Jack Ryan's wife beatified for sainthood... can there be a more perfect wife, mother, doctor, confidant, teacher, political analyst, lover, etc, etc, etc.... puke!!!"
2,Good grief!,"We're (my husband and I) the sort of Clancy fans that register months ahead of time for the next Jack Ryan novel. We're pretty disappointed with this one, for most of the same reasons listed by other readers. Ryan is a little too whiny and way too crude. Many of the details are off kilter. Most of all, the Nomuri/Ming/sausage business is REALLY beneath what we've come to expect from Mr. Clancy and left us both sickened. I'd like to know what happened to better sensibilities of his agent and the editors?"
2,Need more cussing,Hey Tom I think you need to use the F word or GD a little more. Every other sentence was just not enough. Normally I can read a Clancy book in 3 days. The last 2 I have had to make myself finish. This one should have gone straight to paper back.......
2,Clancy needs a good editor,"Few books, especially novels, are worth reading that are over 1000 pages long. This novel would have been much better at 500 pages. To be cut, would be the endless descriptions of Ryan, our newly elected President, thinking and talking about social security, abortion, balance of payments and other Clancy thoughts on government and Washington policy or the lack thereof. Who cares what Clancy thinks on these subjects. Give us a good read, lots of action and plausible reality. We get enough of the rest on talk shows and in The New York Times"
3,"Rehashing old stuff, no spark","Without spoiling things, I felt that ""The Bear and the Dragon"" was, at times, a rewrite of ""Debt of Honor"" and ""Red Storm Rising."" Like other reviews, I think Mr. Clancy could have trimmed the book by a good 300 pages.I also did not like his extensive use of profanity. I don't recall him using so much foul language in his other books.Clancy is one of my favorite authors, but this book is not his best. It has it's moments, but most of it is quite flat and almost boring (i.e., the first 300 or so pages).I expect better, Mr. Clancy."
2,tediouser and tediouser,"In the summer of 1988, I had a day devoted to reading Clancy's first novel. Didn't eat, didn't sleep until I had finished it. And for every novel since, my life has gone on hold because I can't stop reading it. Until his latest, of course. Though some of his novels are a bit verbose at times, this takes the cake! Are his editors (if there are any) too scared of him to use their red pens? Or are they even bothering to read anymore? Publisher, beware: you will lose money and Clancy fans on this one - and deservedly so. Tom (if I may be so bold), beware: save your readers the sermons and the repetition and get back to the fast-moving thriller/suspense we have all grown to love. Might I suggest you revisit Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising? Or hire me as your editor."
1,finally finished it,Clancy has taken a medeocre 300 paged novel and expanded it into a horrendous novel of over 1000 pages. This is his worst to date and is the last of the hard cover editions of his books I will buy. He is still an interesting read but the development is so slow you start losing interest. Just think back to the hunt for red october or red storm rising. This was clancy at his best. Now he has used up the genre and should develop new and interesting characters not the same cast of characters that can do no wrong.
1,What a waste!,"I don't want to just pile on here like everyone else, but this book was such a monumental waste of time I'd feel remiss if I didn't say something. Much like the other reviewers here I'm a big fan of Clancy's earlier works. However, I'm beginning to lose faith in what was once one of my favorite writers. In ""The Bear and the Dragon"", I found most of the dialogue to be tedious and repetitive. The plot line wanders along with all the purpose of a random Arctic ice berg. Look out Titanic fans! If you value your time even in the slightest do yourself a favor, pass on this book and wait for more reader reaction before picking up Clancy's next tome. I wish I'd had the foresight to do so this time around."
1,Yawn yawn....booooring,"As an old Clancy/Ryan fan, this one just didn't make the cut. Tired storyline, much too long. About 1/3 of the book is editorializing about the presidency and about ""evil"" China - no place for all that waffle in a novel of this kind. I waded through to the end, but it was barely worth it. Of all the Ryan novels, this has got to be the worst. Certainly not worthy of all the others. Sad to see."
1,Ghost Written by the Clancy Brothers,"The absolute WORST! Mr. Clancy needs to get off his soapbox and come back down to earth. We read you Mr. Clancy because your stories were often compelling, (a bit verbose and too technical at times), but the meat and potatoes of the story are well done. I could care less about your political agenda. If you need to speak about it, use another avenue.If you possess the political philosophy of a neo-facist John Bircher this book is for you."
2,Big big disappointment !,"I realy loved every ""Jack Ryan"" book that Clancy wrote until this one. This one is one too much. ""Jack Ryan"" was consumed to its poor end. Enough. He should start thinking of a new hero, no Jack Ryan, no John Clark, but a new one, a fresh one.The book was boring from page 1 until about 200 pages from the end. These last 200pages were more interesting, but still, as a unit, this book is boring.As a Clancy fan, I hope that he will return to himself next time."
5,Heavy Book!,"I just finished this epic novel of Tom Clancy's and I thought it was great. My arms got a bit tired holding it but other than that it was an enjoyable read. I liked the character development and enjoyed ""seeing"" old friends again - Jack Ryan et al. I disagree with most of the reviews here and wanted to get my view on record."
4,Not too shabby,"This book is by far on of Tom Clancy's best novels besides Rainbow Six and Sum of All Fears. It's full of action, spy and mind racing adventure. The only downpart was the ""japanese sausage"" part. It was kind of lame, (especially since i'm a guy) Anyhow, I highly reccomend this book to all Clancy fans and others."
3,The Boring and the Draggin,"And I like Tom Clancy, BUT. Too long, too repetitious,too little editing, too many lectures, ...and yet you hang in to read about the new weapons and details of war. Jack Ryan is only in an action scene because he does something irresponsible. Who is left to be the enemy? The next one will be fascinating or forgetable. We'll see."
2,Disappointed,"Ryan has become the caricature of a crass, crusty middle-age man. Too much sex, too much foul language, too many stupid locker-room jokes, too much sermonizing and too little editing (the same clichéd phrases over and over). The book drags through the beginning and only picks up in the last few hundred pages. But the end is disappointing and unsatisfactory, as if the last few pages were abrubtly wrapped up."
3,Best Clancy in years!!!,"Tom Clancy was, in my mind, the unequivocall master of the techno thriller untill Without Remorse, that was the last great book he wrote, untill now. Although The Bear and the Dragon is not as good as Clancy's early work it is far better than Executive Orders, Rainbow Six or any of the CRAP he writes as the Op-Center or Power Plays series. This book takes us back to the style of Hunt for Red October or Red Storm Rising. I would recomend it to anyone."
3,"Tighter story, please...","While there are some compelling moments in this story, this is a book that could have been about 400 pages shorter. I've always enjoyed Clancy's work, but I felt that there was too much political posturing in this story and unnecessary backstories much like his more recent Ryan-verse stories. I'd like more techno-thrills from this techno-thriller author, and there simply wasn't enough.That said, the last 300 pages were entertaining - I just wish the 1st 700 pages were as entertaining."
3,"Not his best, but still a good read","The last few pages are extremely hoaky, but until then the book moves along well and preserves plausibility."
2,Predictable,"This book wasn't too good. I guess it was trying to be realistic talk, but I got pretty tired of all the ""slant-eyes"" remarks. The sausage stuff was not clever or witty, it was just kind of gross. I don't think most people reading this kind of book (mostly men) want to read about some guys ""Japanese Sausage"" over and over and over again.And the whole last part was predictable...everything in the last couple of hundred pages could've been predicted by about page 500--I knew what was going to happen with the hunter guy, I knew what was going to happen with Clark and all that followed their actions, almost exactly what was going to happen, and the aftermath was also totally predictable."
1,My Last Clancy,"I've read every Tom Clancy fiction title, but this will be the last. Aside from the many oversights in editing, I'm simply disappointed to see what has happened to my favorite characters. Good ol' Jack Ryan, formerly a regular guy (despite his wealth, intelligence, hero status, and Harrison Ford good looks), now shamelessly preaches about ""treehuggers,"" Roe V. Wade, Liberals in Congress, White House hanky-panky and whatever else irks Mr. Clancy. Other valued characters, including Robby (V.P.) Jackson and George (Trader) Winston, have become similarly obnoxious. Whether one agrees with the politics or not, this is not why we read Clancy ""thrillers."" I would agree with a previous reviewer about the possibility of a ghost writer here; I'm sure it was Rush Limbaugh."
2,Where is the action?,"I am on page 315 and bored out of my mind with this book! When will the action begin? I too am offended by the increased use of foul language in this book, a definate departure from Clancy's other books, of which, for the most part, I have enjoyed reading. Since I am a die-hard fan, however, I will continue reading this book, although my money may have been better spent on one of the ""Op-Center"" series books."
1,The Bore and the Drag on,"Some how my previous lengthy review of this tome didn't make the list, therefore with public spirit in mind I will add my one star and suggest that Mr. Clancy hire an editor. No one should waste the time to read this regurgitated pap."
3,A solid B+ for Clancy,"This book is like getting a B+ paper from your A++ student - I'm disappointed and wondering what happened. Tom Clancy is my favorite writer. I ordered this book to be delivered to my beach vacation, and waited anxiously for it to appear. Although the Clancy-style is there, the story line isn't polished enough for a writer of his caliber. Repetitive phrases are distracting and none of the characters (including Ryan)have the depth they had in previous books. I do recommend the book if you're a fan already, but if you're not, then start back at the beginning of his books, with the Hunt for Red October or Red Storm Rising."
4,"Good, But Not Great, Clancy","Overall, better than Rainbow Six (by a long shot), but I actually liked Executive Orders better. No matter, it's still decent Clancy, which means intricate plotting, lots of modern high tech, good action (when it finally gets going), and politics that will annoy the liberals. Don't let the 1000 pages fool you; it's a pretty quick read, and a lot more satisfying than most of the other thick tomes out there."
1,Clancy at his worst,"I agree with T. Drizzle almost word for word. I found itlong-winded and - well- boring! More superficial than Sum and less entertaining than Rainbow. I thought he glossed over sections that needed attention and poured pages into things that had no bearing on the story.I read for fun and relaxation and this was neither. Maybe Clancy suffers from too much success, since his other books were so well done, but without the Clancy name and reputation, I would have put this one down after the first slow 500 pages. In retrospect, I should have.I have read and own all the Clancy titles, but my next Cancy will come from the Library...Does anyone know a current author that writes like Clancy used to write? I guess it is time to move on...."
1,Each book just gets worse...,"I remember the ""good old days"" when picking up a new Clancy book was an event to look forward to. But now I find myself dreading the first few pages on any new Clancy volume, especially after the disaster that was Rainbow Six.It seems that as the threat of the cold war recedes, Tom finds it more difficult to develop interesting storylines which are relevant (and realistic). It was always Tom's portrayal of the battle or espionage, and the realpolitik which motivates governments and the military alike, which captured my imagination.I can't maintain interest in a thousand page book if it reads like a soap opera!"
4,"Come on folks, this ain't Shakespeare...","If you are looking for literary art, don't buy this book. On the other hand, if you are just looking for an action-packed 1000-page book that you can waste a couple of afternoons on, this is the right book for you, unless you are one of those politically correct people who can't even think of reading non-PC material. I skipped through about 25% of the book because some of his ""let me show you how much military-techno stuff I know"" details got to be too tedious and boring but I compare this to the use of the fast-forward button when viewing a straight-to-video action flick featuring Jean Claude Van Damme."
1,A Demeaning Book to all Chinese and Americans,"This book is demeaning to all Chinese, female and male. In Mr. Clancy's book, all Chinese men are sadistic, simple-minded, and evil. All Chinese women are willing to do anything for western goods and money. All American officials and military personnel are extremely casual in using racial terms and profanity. It is obvious Mr. Clancy lives in a world vastly different than this one."
2,What an ending!,"If I wrote 1000 pages of hash and rehash, I would be so tired I would probably have come up with as lame an ending as this one. He must get paid by the pound. I could hardly BEAR to DRAG-ON."
4,Not Up to Snuff,"I'm afraid, no, I know, Tom Clancy is slipping. He's been my favorite fiction author since 1984, and even part of the reason I'm in my current job. However, for the last few installments, his work has been slipping, and with ""Bear"" he's finally over the precipice. As many other reviewers mention, the plot is recycled, and to me the portrayal of the Chinese antagonists is jingoistic at best, if not outright racist (not that I think the PRC government is on our side, but I simply expected a better work from Clancy--his analysis of the Russian mindset had so much more to it). In addition, his reputation was made on his excruciating attention to detail, and this appears to be slipping as well. I could go on and on . . . The four star rating for comparison to other authors; on a Clancy-only scale I'd give it about a 2."
1,Shoot the Editor!!,"Tom, what the heck happened here? Whether or not you put out an interesting novel anymore is up for discussion. However, please don't insult your incredibly loyal and fanatically devoted readers with multiple typos and other editorial nonsense.We deserve a refund or at least an explanation"
1,Shoot the editor!!!,"Tom, what the heck happened here? Whether or not you put out an interesting novel, please don't insult your devoted fans with typos and other editing nonsense (virtually the same sentence 2x in the same paragraph).I think we deserve a refund or an explanation."
1,Junk,This book reveals Clancy's complete ignorance of any country's military abilities or geopolitical strategy. The only thing he seems to know is a smattering of facts about US force details and hardware. Not reccomended for anyone looking for any realism
3,an okay read,"In the middle of the book, i took some time and read some of the other reviews here to see what i was getting myself into by reading this book. The beginning was RATHER slow, and i found myself skipping over some of the more techno-jargon that i didn't really think i needed to know to enjoy the book. That being the case, not reading those sections, didn't hinder my enjoyment reading another good book by mr. clancy. however, i would recommend to anyone who reads this to re-read ""Executive Order"" and *maybe* ""Rainbow Six"" and ""Debt of Honor."" Since it had been a while since i had read those books, i found myself scouring my brain to remember the correct circumstances the characters were referring to. With all of that said--the last 100-200 pages move like lightening and are very exciting. Enjoy!"
3,Winning Story,Exciting solid story that's believable and potential; I wish he'd get help when writing dialogue for women.
2,"Well, I can't share this one with my teens.","I'm not even finished with the book, but felt compelled to write an online review. I have read all (except Rainbox Six) of Clancy's books and thoroughly enjoyed them and passed them along. If the character's names were changed and someone had asked me to read this book and tell them who wrote it, Tom Clancy would not have come to mind. I have always loved the fact that Mr. Clancy wrote exciting books, that didn't have all the language and sex in them that this one did. I sincerely hope this is not a new trend. I can't pass this one along...."
1,I'd rate it zero stars if that were an option,A tedious book to read. Unlike anything else I've seen by Clancy. He takes whole chapters to say what could be said (more entertainingly) in a paragraph. (In this he shares a fault with Stephen King...though King is a much better writer.)
2,Not a Clancy Book,"I am a big Tom Clancy fan. I have read all his books and have enjoyed everyone of them until now. The first 800 pages ramble and the final 200 are plain silly. It was a big disappointment after such books as The Sum of All Fears and Rainbow Six. Come on Tom, if you are not ready to write a good book then don't write anything. We are spoiled."
1,Worse Clany novel yet,I was looking forward to reading the newest Clancy novel. Most of the time I can't put it down but this one I could. There is hardly any action in this book. Most of his books have been action packed. We also get to read about Clancy's views on abortion. This book is not worth the money. Wait till you can get it at an used book store.
2,What Happened???,"I am so disappointed. Meaningless pornographic sex, nedless swear words galore, endless preaching (literally, in some cases) and almost no action. Ugh. What happened to the story, the drama, the action? Almost no one does anything but whine and complain. Diplomats, president, field agent. Doesn't matter who the character is, no one is happy anymore and they've all lost their zest to do their jobs. I was very excited to get my hands on this book, and then it actually took several trys to get even a couple of chapters into it. I nearly stopped reading it several times. I just didn't expect to have to work that hard to get to the good stuff. Looks like Mr. Clancy is writing for the paycheck and getting paid by the word to do it. What a letdown."
1,Too ponderous for words,"This book was much too ponderous. It was a chore to read it all the way through. I've read all of Clancy's novels, and this was the worst, even exceeding Rainbow Six. It was as if he cut and pasted dialog and scenes from his other novels to make up the first 700 pages of this one. It was deja vu, with all the same characters, and all their same viewpoints. I don't recommend it for anyone, and I won't suckered into buying the next one. Goodbye Tom."
2,Linguistic Disappointment,"After being a Clancy fan for a more years than I wish to remember, I was ecstatic at the prospect of another blockbuster novel. While the plot plods along at a snail's pace, one expects it to pick up tempo through the novel as does many of his other works. However, the big disappointment and linguistic ""slap in the face"" is his prolific use of vulgarities throughout the novel. This seems to be a new Clancy, with new and needless usage of vulgar language that seems to have little reason other than shock value. Indeed, one is reading along and suddenly is confronted phrases of ""f"" this, or ""mf"" that, that derails the reader from the story. I hope Mr. Clancy reads this and reconsiders using such language to such an extent in the future. It's not that we don't know that it exists, it's just hard to imagine it exists at such a voluminous variety and with such rapidity."
4,Preachy and Slow,"I have read all of Mr. Clancy's books in this series. This one was something of a disappointment. From the outset, he uses Jack Ryan's thoughts and speeches to preach social conservative agenda items. I don't disagree with those items nor do I strongly agree with them but he should have toned it down some. For example, in several passages abortion is brought up. The story was predictable but slow to develop. Ther was also a problem with incomplete story lines. The Rainbow Six team at first seemed to be a primary part of the story but actually played a small role. All that aside, it was good to see what happened to Jack Ryan after the last book. I look forward to the next one in this series."
1,I couldn't finish it. My arms got tired.,"1,000 pages? After I read 500 of them, I checked out the customer reviews and found that all but the most die-hard and blindly loyal Clancy fans pretty much panned the book. How I wish I had read them before I burdened the poor UPS man with delivering these pounds of pages.Clancy was never a creative, subtle novelist. He's a storyteller, and he has a history of being a good one. But my head is sore from his hitting me over the head with each of his beliefs, one or two of which I actually agree with (Well, one).If you want this book, don't buy it. You can have mine (only slightly used)."
1,disappointed,"Tom we love you but get an editor. The page count could be cut 40% and not miss a beat. The battle scenes were mostly boring, alot of repetitive dialogue and the interesting character's that were introduced were never fully developed. What happened to Ettore and the pelt guy? I agree with most other reviewers-should have cut the middle and increased the ending. As a Clancy fan I will continue to read the series, but it's not so much fun anymore. ps- If another character says 'duly noted' again I will scream."
1,Bad show for a Tom Clancy novel,"Unlike Tom Clancy's previous works, The Bear and the Dragon falls way short of the standard that fans have come to expect from him. His potrayal of the average PRC Chinese is accurate -if the book was set in the early 80s. Many racist remarks are sprinkled throughout the book, making a boring product offensive as well. Give it a miss and spend your money somewhere else."
2,Clancy needs an editor!,"This book is really long and rather tedious. Tom Clancy needs an editor! His attention to detail is really slipping. Here are two small examples: he describes the language of China as ""Guoyu"" which is what Chinese is called on Taiwan. In China, everyone calls it ""putonghua;"" he also mentions a U.S. Navy port call to Taipei. Taipei is not a port but is ten miles from the sea. Taiwan's main ports are Keelung and Kaohsiung. In general, Clancy appears to have never visited China and so describes a mainland culture that is sadly out of date."
2,Disappointing Effort,"In essence, if the reader has read Clancey's prior efforts, the reader has already read The Bear and the Dragon. It is time for Clancey to move on to a new theme or re-kindle his plot development skills shown in The Cardinal in the Kremlin.Sadly, each story line reaches a conclusion hundreds of pages after the conclusion is evident to the reader. This has not been the case in previous Clancey efforts.As to the publisher, it would be nice if they hired a proof-reader for Mr. Clancey's next book."
2,Where's the plot?,"Somewhere in these 1,000 pages there is a decent 250 page book trying to get out. A sentence here, a paragraph there. The problem is that we gotta read the whole thing to get the little that is there. A wonderful job of padding by Mr. Clancey. And phew, do real people cuss as much as these guys do?"
3,Okay --tending towards sloppy,"Tom Clancy is getting lazy. Many times in TBATD different characters make identical observations or comments --looks like Tom's got the Copy and Paste functions sorted out on his Macintosh. The editing also leaves much to be desired. The manuscript was obviously passed through a spell checker, but there were lots of word-choice and grammatical errors that interrupted the flow of things.Others have also commented on the abrupt ending and it's true that for a book of over 1,000 pages, the ending seemed quite clipped.Overall, I enjoyed The Bear and the Dragon, but for Clancy it was a middling effort. I am also praying that Jack Ryan is done being such a whiner and complainer."
3,"Read em all, this one's average",I'm a big Clancy fan who has read every one of his books. This one has too much build up to too little climax for me. I found myself skipping over pages to read for more interesting passages..this I almost never do with a Clancy novel. I love Jack Ryan..but I don't think I would vote for him based on his handling of this crisis..which he makes worse at every turn.. The best character was Robby..and maybe he ought to be the next preseident while Jack goes home and becomes a house father and Cathy runs for the senate in new York!
2,Disappointing instalment of Jack Ryan,I'd loved all the other Jack Ryan stories I'd read (though I hadn't read all of them). This was a little too coarse and nowhere near as good as the earlier ones.
5,Clancy rules - OKAY?,"I went on holiday to relax, took The Bear and The Dragon with me and spent most of the holiday in a state or nervous exhaustion! How does Clancy do it time after time? What's his secret? His understanding of wars and fighting machines is unsurpassable, his understanding of the different cultures is a bonus. You should read The Bear and the Dragon, just to get an understanding of world politics. Top marks for Tom Clancy for pulling another thriller out of the bag."
1,A real stupid book,"One of the most boring and stupid books I`ve read in a long time. Full of ignorant remarks. From Mr Clancys observation that asian girls like westerners because they are better ""equipped"" than the asian males, via people saying Comrade Doctor etc to each other in Russia, ten years after the Soviet Unions fall, to the ""fact"" that american girls are slimmer and healthier than the rest of the world(when we know that they are sicker due to overweight than the rest of the world). Well, a writer can write about his white supremacy but when he writes as boring as Tom Clancy does in this book it gets completely uninteresting. Just pure typewriting and after 350 pages I had to give up.  Yes, and I spell terrible..."
1,Worst Clancy novel yet,"I have to agree with the majority on this one, I wondered whether actually wrote this book! The repetitive dialogue, cliches, and profanity are not hallmarks of the earlier Jack Ryan dramas. In fact, Jack Ryan seemed different; does being President cause one to become profane, cynical, and less intelligent? Oh, yeah, I forgot...I think Clancy needs a hiatus to reclaim the essence of writing about techno-political issues."
3,"Too Long, Too Preachy","While the book had good suspence , I felt it would have been a better read at 800 pages and please loose the pandering to the military and making each character, the best of the best of the best."
2,The Bore and the Drag On,"Good Grief, it takes nearly seven hundred pages to get going! It is too long and drawn out, not nearly as clear and concise as it could be. How many times must we hear President Ryan refer to his wife as ""Babe"", enough already. It is time to develop new characters, Ryan has lost his fire! He is no longer an interesting character. Tom Clancy- start fresh with new characters please!!!"
2,Where is the old Clancy?,"I think that Tom Clany is either over the hill, or just not working hard anymore. There was a point in his career where i loved nothing more than to be reading one of his books. But now, he makes everybody so wimpy. Where are Ding and Clark???? In my opinion his two strongest characters, they are left behind in the field!!!!!I want the old Clancy, or i want my money back."
3,Not the Clancy of old...,I found this work to be less than what I have come to expect from Clancy. The basic elements that have made him so popular are still there (expert plot development and the ability to run multiple story lines without confusion) but this book seemed formulaic and not a little bit angry. There seems to be an underlying asian xenophobia in the writer that isn't there when he writes of Russian or Arab enemies. I wonder why? I still love Clancy but I am hoping for more in post-presidental Ryan.
3,Is Clancy loosing it?,"I have been an avid Clancy reader ever since Red October. The suspense was so great that I could not put the book down and read it in one sitting. I have bought every book since, and in hard cover!But Bear and Dragon was a great dissapointment. It did not even get interesting until after I turned over 700 pages. The long rambling background the first half of the book was a total waste. What happened to the great suspense and action?And the last 200 pages were too short and incomplete. Worst yet was the close.....there wasn't any!"
3,On The Rebound??,"Well, Tom had some spelling errors in this one, but the one error he did not make was creating a sequel to Rainbow Six. That book was 1/2 star. This one gets three because it is: - a rebound from Rainbow Six - over 1,000 pages - a decent story - cool technologyIf you have read every Clancy novel (and, like me read two in a week when you just started) this one follows the ""pattern"". Get through the first 200 pages, it gets faster. You are addicted between 400-800, then it has a rapid wind down."
4,The Bear and The Dragon,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Read all 1,028 pages in less than a week. I've own all of Clancy's books in hardcover and rate this one solidly in the middle. I only wonder why Clancy as to sell his books by the pound."
2,Clancy in his twilight...,"If someone had attended a creative writing course and was given an assignment to write a 'Clancy-esque' military-thriller but had then decided to turn it into a parody or 'literary-caricature', they would have ended up with 'The Bear and the Dragon'. It was ponderous, predictable and way too long. It took me less than a week to finish my library copy but then I would speed read past the tedious sections (which was frequent). Eric Harry did a much better treatment of the subject in either 'Arc Light' or 'Protect and Defend' and he went so far as to actually take out DC with a nuke in the first one, something that I think most readers were rooting for especially after Ryan does his idiotic Clint Eastwood routine with the aegis cruiser as the warheads are falling. Also, Clancy has quite a set of double standards considering that he broke up his marriage through infidelity. I guess his Ryan universe is a 'do what I say, not what I do' kind of place."
2,Not up to Clancy's usual standards,"Same old, same old. I could tell what was going to happen, who does what to whom, at every step in the story...I can even predict when Ryan will say ""I hate this job"".Where are the rebels in uniform, the kooky scientists, the hateful politicians, and even the journalists in this 1000+ re-hash of the 3 previous books.Don't spend your money. If you have to have it, wait for the paperback!"
1,The Bear and the Dragon,"I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Clancy years ago, right after The Hunt for Red October caught the country by storm. I liked his book and his writing. I have read almost all his books, the paperback techno thrillers are trash, and it only took 3 of them to convince me he was getting paid for his name and not his talent. His latest book has some good ideas but he gets lost delivering the material with bizarre subplots that had no meaning on the story. It is like he is getting paid by the pound for his work. This book could have been done in 600 pages and it would have been a page turner, instead it was 1000+ pages of yawner in some spots. This book was worse than Rainbow Six which was pure manure, because it could have been a good book. Rainbow Six started with the impossible and continued to get more unbelievable on every page. At least this book has some interesting ideas, but his delivery of the material to the public missed by a long shot."
2,A average Book by Tom Clancy's standards,"I cannot help but feel disapointed at the standard of Tom Clancy's latest novel- "" the Bear and the Dragon"" I feel that he keeps repeating himself and the ending of the novel is too sudden. Its almost as if he wrote the novel and then decided its getting too long or he had something better to do and finished it off suddenly. Considering his other novels, this is of a low quality. Looks like the author is getting complacent with his fame and cannot be bothered with his novels anymore. After all, he has many other ""co-writers"" who use his name to sell their novels-""op-centre"" series comes to mind. Tom should not lower his standards just to produce novels under his name. If he cannot be bothered writing a quality novel HIMSELF, he should not write any. It would only harm his reputation and disapoint his readers/fans."
2,Could have been another exciting read BUT...,"Having read all of Tom Clancy's books in chronological order, I have always been inclined to ignore his blatantly extreme conservative views for the sake of getting an exciting story in return... these huge novels were always a nice read on the beach, at least.In ""Bear & Dragon"" though, Mr. Clancy's right-wing outlook on life has gone completely over the top. His repetitive mentioning of those disgusting ""tree-huggers"", ""chinks"" and ""rats"" really turned me off, as did his boring excessive macho talk and two-dimensional view of the female gender. Also, I couldn't help to notice that Mr. Clancy all at once seems to be fascinated by having his main characters use the bathroom... no problem with that basically, but his fixation on nature's call wore kind of thin by the time I reached page 300 or so.On top of that, poor editing (John becomes Jack) and stereotyped characters spoil much of the reading fun that this book could have provided."
1,"Racist, patronizing, uniformed and soooo boring","There is little to add here that hasn't been said by hundreds of other reviewers. I cannot see how anyone could enjoy reading any of this. Of all the different bad points, I think that TC's absurd, uninformed and racist fantasies about China in 1999 (or 2000?) were the most outrageous. To sum it up: poor literary style, poor editing, poor plot, poor dialogues, poor research, poor knowledge, poor readers, and a very rich author."
3,not a very good Jack Ryan Novel,"This book takes place after the setting of Executive Orders. It talks about war between Russia and China. Clancy has written about war against every possible US foe-USSR, Japan, Iran, and now in this book he sets his eyes on the People's Republic of China.However, this book lacks the excitement of Executive Orders (however, its difficult to live up to this book). I think Clancy did a hurried up job on this one (he even admitted he rushed through the ending in an interview in C Span).Its okay for Jack Ryan fans, but not all that good."
3,"Well, are you bored ?","This was the first Clancy book I've read and also the first one in English. It got me going and going, but as I looked back, it was looooooong and tiresome.I don't think anyone sould try reading it, it's long and not too intresting if you're looking to something thrilling.All in all is one of the good guys so think I'll keep trying his books out anyway."
1,Do not buy this book,"Tom Clancy's first book, ""The Hunt for Red October"" was probably the best and most scientifically accurate books of its genre. Clancy's grasp of military technology and tactics is close to that of a professional soldier and this shows in his books. However his undestanding of cultures and international politics is probably inferior to that of a redneck. When he sticks to writing military books Clancy is quite all right. This time he went too far into geo-politics thereby showing a dangerous ignorance which I hope is not shared by most Americans. The result is an implausible, racist book which tarnishes Tom Clancy's reputation."
1,easy to put down,"This was my first Clancy book and was very easy to put down. Perhaps in a few...weeks, months,Pick up another ""heart-stopping action "" as quoted from the Washington Post, book of his and read what I've been missing."
2,Drags On,"""Not Clancy's best work,"" is a common reaction to this book. The problem with that is it implies that Clancy ""worked"" and that conclusion is doubtful. Many reviewers have noted that ""The Bear and the Dragon"" is full of repitition, that Clancy repeats himself, says the same thing again and again. Others have noted that Clancy is becoming too ""preachy."" All of this is true.So, only read this novel of you are a true Clancy fanatic; otherwise, re-reading ""Red October"" or ""Without Remorse"" would be more rewarding."
2,is clancy a has been?,"There is no question Clancy sees himself as a patriotic american. he has proselytised the great american values in all of his works. and I agreed with them in most occassions. I have always thought he makes a legitimate point weather I agreed with him or not. the latter is simply because he uses facts to back up all this points. this book, however, strays from his usual facts based arguments. I find his points on international free trade to be shallow and inaccurate and his knowledge of China next to nothing. I have not finished reading this book and I must say deviations from facts make this a very daunting task. as a result, I must ask, is clancy a has been?"
1,A Great Book If You Have a Lot of Time to Waste!,"Tom Clancy is a victim of his own success. Instead of trying to write a compelling story, he is coasting on his reputation. The Bear and The Dragon is a bore! It is nothing more than a pulpit for Clancy's personal political views. The reader has to wait about 400 pages for the first halfway decent action. Most of the remaining 600+ pages are equally limp. Jack Ryan would be ashamed by this sell out!"
1,"Going, Going, ... what next?","I have had enormous pleasure reading (and re-reading) the offerings by TC over the last decade. I was hooked with the HFRO movie with Connery & it led me to Red Storm Rising, which was an excellent 2nd offering. Over time I have looked forward to each TC book, the pinacle being Executive Orders. Since Executive Orders, TC seems to be putting out books under some oppresive contractural obligation. B&D is his worst. Little character development, implausible plot, and an ending that has made me wonder whether TC has lost his passion, will now make me think twice before I put out $$$ for his next hard cover. I'll probably buy his next book but only because it woud be difficult to get any worse. I hope TC recognises that what he started all of those years ago with Jack Ryan has resulted in an enormous responsibility to his devoted readers. His only saving grace recently was being sent up on the Simpsons --- but then, an Icon is an Icon."
1,WHATS UP WITH CLANCY?????????,"I've read all of Clancy's books and the last few have become slow reading bores. I use to wait with eagerness for his next book. After attempting Bear which I gave up within 250 pages, i'm threw with him. TO LONG, TO BORING! Let him teach @ Annapolis or West Point or Harvard but his fiction is so bad compared to Hunt for Red October or Clear and Present Danger. I just hate his books have developed into a insomniacs cure."
2,The Bear and the Dragon,"I was disappointed with this book. It started off well, but the finish was flat. Clancy concentrated on numerous ""dead end"" sub-stories that eventually became irrelevant, and cut off other that looked as though they would have been quite substantial and enjoyable for the reader. I would have liked to have spent more time with the Chinese and Russian field commanders, instead of trapsing around Moscow and St. Petersburg. Clancy did an excellent job of describing hyper-war, but would have done better to add a few ""survivng witnesses"" to the destruction to add some color. This is the first Tom Clancy book that I wouldn't buy again."
1,Ugh.,"Has anyone else noticed that Mr. Clancy loses a half a star with each new book? And it seems each book gets many pages longer as well. And how can they not when there are so many references to Golokov holding a gun to Ryan's head and other inane self-promoting marketing jabs for his past books? Honestly, 1000 pages of lukewarm, mundane, blase storylines, Mr. Clancy's own interpretation of historical events, and finally 28 pages of a climax you could have predicted on page 792, but still had to read another 200 pages to get to. It wasn't enough in my eyes."
3,Clancy returns to an R Rated book,"Wow - another techno thriller that I could not put down. The content and structure, for the most part, was great and sure listed some very likely screnarios with all the techno info that Mr. Clancy is famous for. Unfortunately this will probably be the last Clancy book I read. Similar in nature to Without Remorse, Mr Clancy, with this book, is setting a new tone for this and coming books where gratuitous profanity and sex have a much higher profile than ever before. I wish that Mr Clancy would take a queue from Mr Cussler, who wanted readers of all ages and sensibilities to be able to read his books, and took his books to that level by taking out the gratuitous profanity and sex with great success."
2,Very poor considering past performances...,"First off, I'm a huge Clancy and Techno thriller fan. However, I found this book long and very un realistic. Do we need to know how much Ryan hates his job over and over? The US would do nothing after a Nuclear missle attack? Probably not. Fang would go talk to the people at the end of the book? Talk about a change of character from the beginning of the book. Was all the ""sausage"" talk necessary? Run out of bombs? Why were we not using B-1B's? B-2's All of this equipment could strike at China's forces from the beginning? Ever heard of in flight refueling? We do it all the time? Cruise missles? F-22's?I was totally disappointed with this book. Normally it is much more difficult to find discreptencies from reality in his books? As another review said wait for clearance or get it from the library."
3,The Bear and the Dragon,"I have a first edition of ""The Hunt for Red October"" and all of Clancy's other novels. This one is an average techno-thriller, but not a Clancy. Years ago Clancy stated that he couldn't write a love making scene ""to save his soul"". Well, in this book he proves himself right. I can almost tell which chapters that were written when his divorce was not going well. In previous books four letter words were used to make a point, but this book it sounds like Nixon or Clinton was talking and it takes away from the story line. I hope Tom does not listen to his editors on the next book and that it matches his previous books."
1,"Boring Racist, Right Wing Dribble.","I bought this book understanding that Clancy is just to the right of Attila the Hun, however he can write an incredibly tight techo-military thriller. Unfortunately, I had to wait until almost the end of the book before Clancy hit his stride. The rest of the book was right-wing, racist, xenophobic dribble. Clancy's knowledge of China and Chinese culture is totally MIA. Buy his earlier works, if you want, but stay away from this misguided tome."
1,Really poor effort,"As a previously devout Clancy fan, I found this book to be boring, excessively sexist, racist, and a complete waste of my time. It was so bad I vowed to never again buy a Clancy book. If you liked Hunt for Red October or Cardinal of the Kremlin, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME with this one."
2,Failed attempt to continue the Jack Ryan series,"I've been a fan of the Jack Ryan series but this one is surely a dissapointment. The main problem is Tom Clancy's ignorance of China. If only he has been to China in the recent years, he will find things vastly different than he depicted. Instead he depicted China the same as Russian in the 70s which makes the novel looks much less real and repetitive."
3,decent...but confusing,The book uses way too many abbreviations. I mean he goes out of his way to add them...POTUS(president of the united states)...why use it?!.....this was my first clancy novel and i'm not so sure if i will return for another after this loooooooong disappointment.
1,Don't Bother,"Clancy has reached his bottom in this book, which he uses merely as a pulpit for his political/saocial preachings. The plot is thin and not plausible, the characters are stiff and unreal, and the language is stilted and meaningless in many places. He uses his word of the day several times in a few pages, then it disappears. Don't bother. I read 200 pages, then quit!"
1,Editors are useful,"After slogging through Tom Clancy's Bear and Dragon, I feel sure that Mr. Clancy has thought himself above his editor's advice. My advice to Mr. Clancy would be to listen to your editor a lot more, and if you did, get a new one!"
2,Not his best work,"I enjoyed the parts detailing the military and special forces operations but was less interested in his political ramblings, probably because he knows much more about the former than the latter. I could be wrong but he seems to inject quite a bit of his own politics into those sections."
4,The Bear and The Dragon,"I enjoy Tom Clancy's book, but some times there is a little to much detail in the overall discreption of the mechanical equipement. I guess to the average American who has been in the forces, it is all clear. But to a Canadian women it is clear as mud. But I still enjoy his books."
1,"loooooong, boring and repetitive.","this book took so long to write, that clancy forgot things he wrote and repeated it in the following chapters over and over.He takes you on a journey of all, and i mean ALL that goes on in the characters heads, and there are whole chapters that you could skip and not lose the thread of the story.And then there is POTUS, he can do no bad, he is a saint, he knows what to do and the right time to do it, hes got to be the most flawless character of any book i've ever read, and by that i mean hes just never wrong and he could teach a thing or two to the pope about morality, iv'e enjoyed all of clancy's books, but this one just [stinks]."
1,A huge disappointment,"This has got to be Clancy's literary version of color-by-numbers. The plot is far-fetched, while at the same time too thin. The characters are so well-developed from previous books that all we're left with is Jack Ryan's whining about how he's not right/adequate/suited for the job of president. And while I like Clancy's books, Ryan's philosophizing on subjects ranging from abortion to religion to government smack of the arrogance that Clancy often puts across in personal appearances. Puh-leeze, keep your views to yourself, willya? On top of that, the book was poorly edited, with typos (excusable) and recurring dialogue (inexcusable). To be fair, I read the first edition hard-cover, so maybe this has been corrected in the subsequent editions, but I doubt it. The author's and publisher's philosophy seem to be ""ah what the hell, throw it out there, it'll make money"". Come on, Clancy, you know you can do better."
1,An embarassment,"I have been a Clancy fan ever since ""Hunt for Red October."" However, I will think long and hard before investing any of my time in another one of his books.The Bear and the Dragon reads more like a political lecture than a techno thriller. Clancy has managed to take previously well developed characters and and make them boring and downright irritating at times. As an added insult, much of the dialogue is openly and unnecessarily racist in nature.They say that the back third of this book speeds up and reads more like his earlier work. I wouldn't know - I threw it out in disgust half way through."
1,Man what a lousy book,There are so many things wrong with this book that it is impossible to know where to begin. Besides the blatant racism and gaping plot holes the story is just boring. It is about a one sided victory against a militarily backward foe. Does this story sound familiar? I guess in that way it is somewhat realistic. What I find frightening about this book is not its depiction of a possible conflict for the U.S. Rather it is the discription of the leaders in Washington. If our current Secretary of the Treasury is as stupid as Clancy's Whinston we should all be very afraid. He displays a complete ignorance of little things like the meaning of a trade deficit. If our diplomats are as incompetant as Gant then we are certainly due for a major land war here soon. Please God let it not be so. Amen.
1,could not get my interest,This is the first Clancy novel (and I've read most of them) that I could not finish...actually could not get started. May have been the beginning or simply the weight of the book at over 1100 pages. I switched to a Vince Flynn novel instead.
3,assumptions made too simple for the book,"i think the book might present a better and more logical backdrop to the chinese invasion of siberia by mentioning the historic facts concerning how siberia was lost to russia in the 19 century by the corrupt and incompetent Qing Dynasty regime. This may provide a more balanced reasoning for the poliburo members, rather than depicting them as simple minded greedy thugs. Shouldn't Mr. Clancy be reminded that every politician in every part of the world is inherently greedy, since it is just part of the job description for politicians."
4,Not bad,"I have enjoyed reading this book, maybe not great by Clancy's standards but not as bad as many reviewers are giving it. Obviously if you are of the political left you will not like it. However, i am bothered by the number of typos that i found in this book.Clancy needs to go back to writing techno-thrillers and get new editors!"
2,Who wrote this?!,"I am an avid fan to TC's past work. I think every novel up to and including Executive Orders was fabulous. Rainbow Six was a drag and Bear & Dragon is UNREADABLE.I am reminded of a once incredible athlete who has played about two seasons past his prime. We see this all to often. Tom, please just retire rather than subject us to another one of these. As it stands, TC has gone from my buy the hardcover first week it comes out list to wait for the paperback. If the next one is this bad, he has squeezed his last penny out of me."
5,Clancy's best book yet,What an incredible book. Even though this book was over 1000 pages it didn't have a dull moment. It also had an ending that will leave you breathless.Also recomended: Blood Covenant By Douglas De Bono. If you like Clancy You'll love De Bono
5,Great book - suspenseful and engaging,"Like all Tom Clancy books, this one is engaging and suspenseful. You'd never guess some of the twists. I picked this book up a week ago Saturday and could not put it down. The plot isn't believeable, but that's one reason you read Clancy - to escape from reality into the worlds he creates. If you like suspense, sharp plot twists, and incredibly detailed technical info, you'll love this book."
2,Clancy books are too long,"This may be the last Clancy book I read, and I've read all of them so far. I want books to beg to be read. Clancy goes into such minute detail about military matters that are not needed that it is becoming a chore to get to the end of the book. I get the feeling that he really wants to write military books, or to truely be military, but enough is enough.This book is over 1000 pages long. Take out the unneeded details (100's of pages) and the excessive bad language and you would have a good readable bestseller."
3,Time for this series to end.,"when I was thirteen I read The hunt for Red October. From that book on I was hooked onto clancy's writing, most notably the Jack Ryan books, But it would seem that Clancy's ego has grown as large as his books. This book while entertaining is about 400 pages to long. He is certainly stretching for material and needs to end this series with a final book. One that is 1000 pages long. He was at his best when his books were 500 pages or so ."
2,"Same ole, Same ole","I had really high hopes for this book. Before it came out I knew that it was supposed to have Clark AND Ryan in it, and thought it had great possibilities.However, it just didn't deliver.The language is atrocious compared to earlier books. Clancy must have spent the last few years in the gutter learning how to talk.I really got the feeling that Clancy must be out of new ideas.The book started with the concept of Red Storm: A country goes through a calamity and decides to invade another and take what they want.Then, he delved into the area of Executive Powers and spent a long time talking politics, and ended with a small blitzkrieg.Yawn. I'll test his next book via the library before spending my money."
1,Pity There's not a ZERO Star Category,"Turgid, tepid, tautological, terrible. Predictable, profane, putrid. Chauvanistic, racist and reactionary claptrap by a Clancy who has exceeded his use-by date. Success has obviously bred contempt for his readers. Thank goodness it was a present - it's only unfortunate that my son wasted his money on this dreck."
2,Yuck.,"I have read all of Mr. Clancy's previous works. I was disappointed with this one. Previous reviewers have expressed my views up very well: this book is repetitive, polemical, self-indulgent and *way* too long. Disabling the cut-and-paste ability of Mr. Clancy's word processor would have improved this novel greatly.Is Mr. Clancy really writing these novels anymore, or has he sold the franchise? It is difficult to believe that this is the same author who wrote 'Hunt for Red October' and 'Red Storm Rising'. The poor editing of late makes me wonder if the credit for these earlier should really go to Mr. Clancy's editors of the time.I deeply regret buying this book. I won't buy his next."
1,Major disappointment,"Have read all of the Jack Ryan and/or John Clark books and enjoyed most of them immensely. This latest, however, was a major disappointment. It continues to pull down a formerly refreshing character. I understand that reality does not always present us with perfect heroes and Jack Ryan previously was probably a bit too good to be true. I am sorry to see a character I liked becoming far more crude with each of the latest books. The Ryan character (and the personal character he exhibited) used to pull me through a lot of the technical material that went somewhat over my head. No longer. I will not likely purchase any future novels by Mr. Clancy."
3,Am I reading Harold Robbins or Tom Clancy,"The Bear and the Dragon novel was a success because it was one more Clany novel I couldn't put down. There was one point, though, I had to stop and check the cover to make sure some one hadn't slipped me a Harold Robbins book. Clancy's books are read by those who love his techno-babble and the action connected to it. If I wanted to read about ""Japanese sausage"", and excessive trash talk, I would have picked a different author. I am disappointed with Jack Ryan's turning into such a hot headed potty mouth. It is unfortunate Mr. Clancy fears his book can't stand on its own merit, that he must infuse it with excessive vulgarities to sell.As usual Mr. Clancy has used technology to his best advantage and given us all a thrill of feeling like we are there. I just don't know if the negatives out weigh the positives."
1,Excruciating...,"I can't believe how long this took me to get through. And I can't believe this is the same author of Red Storm Rising and The Hunt for Red October. Rainbox Six was a pretty rough read, but this one has it beat by a mile. Don't expect any real action before, say, page 750 or so, and even then it's tame. Do expect extremely long and boring dissertations by Jack Ryan as to why he hates being president. And lectures by his friends as to why he should be. Do expect everyone to know everyone else. Nary a character is mentioned that Jack or Robbie or someone else doesn't ""know"" or has ""heard of."" Avoid spending your money on this massive, yet boring, book."
2,Did Tom Clancy really write this?,"... or was it one of the net force writers? I loved the first 7 books in this series, so I tried one of the Net Force stories (Tom Clancy's XYZ, written by John Q Doe). I hated it. The story was ok, but the writing, which distinguishes, or at least used to distinguish, Clancy from other authors in this genre, was mediocre at best. Which made sense - Clancy didn't write it.The Bear and the Dragon leaves me with this same bad taste in my mouth. You'll find an unusual expressions uttered by one character and then repeated by a different character whithin pages of the first utterance, but then never again. Swear-words fly at an ungodly rate and temper tantrums are frequent (in general the characters are represented as too volatile to be believable.) And the really sad thing is, the book is a chore to read. Too much build-up, too little execution.I'm disappointed."
4,Not a bad story.,"The Bear and the Dragon was not a bad book. The only problem in my opinion was that it built every thing up and then didn't deliver. I love the way Clancy starts with several subplots that slowly combine and interact with each other resulting in one final confrontation. In this book that didn't really happen. Other reviewers seem to think the book was too long, I personally thought it ended a little too quickly. Maybe Clancy should cut out some of the building up and give us a more satisfying final conflict and resolution. Still, it's a good read."
1,Repugnant,I found this book to be terrible. I am fan of Tom Clancy ever since reading Red Storm Rising and Hunt for Red October over a decade ago.This book seems to have no basis in reality at well. His description of China and its people are off the wall. It is obvious that Tom Clancy has never been to China or interacted with its people based on this book. I have been to China about 8 times in the last year and visit places as varied as Beijing to Guangdong to Kaifeng to Suzhou to Shaolin.Tom Clancy has this distorted view of China...
1,"Awful, Just awful.","If one wanted to read Mr. Clancy's views on everything from Social Security to proper discourse between nations in the new world order, then this is the book for you. If you already follow news or get a daily paper and don't feel like being preached to for eight or nine hundred pages, then move on."
1,This Book Stinks!,"I used to love Tom Clancy as an author. I waited months to get my copy of the Bear and the Dragon. I even went to a bookstore across the street from my job, stood in a long line and got Mr. Clancy to sign my copy. After reading about 190 pages or so, I threw the book, with autograph, in the trash. This was one of the worst books that I have ever opened. The profanity, vulgarity and explicit sex scences were too much for me. I could also mention the typos and the strange languge, i.e., ""honey-bunny."" This was not a good book! I am sure that some could argue that I should have completed the book before I formed his opinion. Believe me, I tried. However, when Mr. Clancy had Mary Pat use a vulgar four letter term for the male sex organ, I knew I was through. This was the third time the term had been used. Needless to say, this is my last Clancy."
1,I Just Can't Take Anymore,"I'm sorry. I've bought and read every one of Clancy's books since his first, the Hunt for Red October. But the more years that pass, the less I like his work. Even Executive Orders was a chore. I was in a bookstore recently and compared his books to War and Peace, and his are longer. I mean seriously, can't it be done better? His stories are pretty good. But his way of telling them has become tedious and now, for me, unendurable. Way too long, way too jerky (from one story line to another, many of which just don't matter), and ultimately dark and humorless. I'm done. No more Clancy for me."
1,The Bore and the Dreadful,"This not as much a review as it is a warning.The Bear and the Dragon is by far the worst book Clancy has ever written. Rainbow Six could be excused by being in reality a backstory for a computergame, but this is supposed to be a novel. Now Clancy has never been an expert user of metaphor, simile, charcterization or even grammar (I'm neither, but then I'm not a native speaker) but he's always been worth reading because of his knowledge of politics, technology, military and his intelligent plotting.This is sorely lacking in this novel. The Sum of all Fears was the best Ryan book - The Bear and the Dragon is the worst and hopefully last. 800 pages of boring build-up to 200 pages of predictable warfare. Throw in some old friends, some small twists and a bit of Rainbow Six and you have this book.If you enter all of Clancys books into a computer, and ask it to write a new Jack Ryan novel, The Bear and the Dragon would be the result. Consider yourself warned."
2,"Shrub/Clancy 2000! - Ugh, a cluster...er, nevermind...","I'm beginning to think that Clancy is this century's Jonathan Swift - that Jack Ryan and his surrounding story is a skeleton that Clancy hangs his political rants on. I get tired of the endless anti-abortion, right-wing demagoguery that has been slowly filling up his books and accelerated with Executive Orders and Rainbow Six. He's a good storyteller who has let his politics poison his books... because the political/social rants REALLY - really - slow down the story.Are there any editors with guts anymore? 200 pages could have been cut from this book with no ill effect."
2,Waste of time,"I'm a Clancy fan, have read all of his books, and ""Without Remorse"" is perhaps my favorite book. But if the Jack Ryan series continues this way, I'm going to have to stop reading. There is entirely too much time spent on the technical detail, with very little character development.Now that Jack Ryan is president, he isn't an underdog, which was the basis of his appeal and heroism. And frankly, there is too much political opinion included with Ryan as president. If I wanted to read about political debate on issues such as gun control and abortion, I'd read the newspaper or watch ""Meet the Press"" or some other news program. I read for entertainment, and Clancy's Ryan series has been getting less entertaining in the past few installments.Unless you are a diehard Clancy fan, save your money for the paperback, or check this out at the library. And be prepared to be put to sleep by the technical details."
1,A cowboy's view of China,"The sheer number of reviews should alert the potential reader that there is something seriously wrong with this book.In it, Jack Ryan changes from an expert in foreign affairs, to a bumbling xenophobic fool, who through his negligent refusal to so much as listen to advice on basic psychology or intercultural relationships, manages to bring the world to the brink of nuclear war.The first 800 pages of the book are a litany of the most disgusting racial vilification that I have ever read, diluted with a mixture of nauseating self-righteous hypocrisy and calls to arm primary school children.Mr Clancy manages to demonstrate a staggering ignorance of China, its people, culture, language, history, and even geography. The linguistic errors, at least, are somewhat understandable. He would have been too ashamed to ask a native speaker to proof-read the manuscript."
2,Not very good,"First, if you are an english teacher, DO NOT read this book. I'm afraid that you will mark most of it up with your red pen. While they seem to have run it through the spell checker, the grammar checker failed miserably! There are incorrect words on every other page.Second, I have read ALL of Clancy's books. If you read ""Red Storm Rising"" you basically read this book. The USS... I mean PLA needs Oil, we team up with the Germa... I mean Russians to fight the Sovie... I mean Chinese and we use our brand new, secret, ultra high tech weapons to overcome incredible odds.So if I had a choice to read this or ""Red Storm Rising"" again, I would take ""Red Storm Rising"", it's a better read."
2,"This can't be Clancy, can it?","I've been a fan of the Ryan series of Clancy's books for years and eagerly anticipate each new release. Loved the majority of them, including the recent 'Debt of Honor' and 'Rainbow Six'. I don't know what the heck happened here, but B&D falls so far short of the previous work that I can't believe it's Clancy's writing. I mean, do Mary Pat and Ed Foley really need to call each other 'honey bunny' 50 times throughout the book? Do I need to be continually reminded that Mao screwed 12 year olds? I think not. An RPG assassination and then nothing but boring diatribe on the Chinese and repetitive nonsense for the next 700 pages until the action begins. And then it's the usual 'Americans are invincible' Hollywood nonsense. No, I can't believe this is Clancy. I'm sure the next one will be better (right Tom?)"
2,Too successful to edit??,"This book needed an editor to say ""Great book, we just need to cut 400 or 500 pages of the first 800, beginning with the politics."" I am guessing when an author sells as many books as Clancy has, he can tell editors to shut up and publish it. It's too bad, because there is a good book somewhere in there. I actually agree with many of his political statements, but I don't need them repeated 10x in a fictional work."
2,The introduction is much too long,"I like the books of Tom Clancy a lot. Thus far I've read all his books and would rate them 5 stars.However, in Rainbow Six, the introduction took about 300 pages. Since there were plenty of pages left, this is no problem.In the bear and the dragon the introduction (the endless talking) takes 800 pages! It was hard to keep on reading.The real action takes place in the remaining pages and ends very quickly. In this part it was hard to stop reading. This is the Tom Clancy I like."
1,Absolutely the worst Clancy I have ever read.,"The book is extremely lengthy, full of unnecessary sexual comments, and rubber-stretched passages. I found myself skipping entire pages. For me, beeing the biggest Clancy fan up to date it is really difficult to say that his work is bad, but every other book I have read was excellent-""The Debt of Honor,"" ""Executive Orders,"" ""Without Remorse,"" to name a few, - but this book absolutely does not grab attention and what is even worse, annoys.Do not recommend."
2,Disappointing,"This novel did not match up to the high standards I had come to expect from Clancy over the years with almost every other one of his novels to this point (all of which I read). Too wordy for the plot line...and then the end was too rushed in my opinion.In addition, Clancy has apparently bought into the dogma that high tech trumps numbers and strategy in all cases. The old saying ""Quantity has a quality all its own"" can still come into play when contemplating land warfare in Asia against Red China. I am afraid a fight like that contemplated here would not be so easily won.Aside from that...too many repetitive phrases, too many stereotypes and too much verbosity in the storyline."
1,Lost his touch,Clancy sure is getting dirty in his old age. A lot more focus on sex than I remember from any of his other books. I couldn't even bring myself to finish reading it since every page was filled with the f-bomb or some description of sex. I'm not sure if I even want to bother with Red Rabbit.
1,Please stop now!,The quality of the Jack Ryan books has reached a new level of crapdom. I don't feel like reiterating the consensus opinions about this one but I feel like throwing all of my Tom Clancy books away now. He has let the quality of his writing hit new lows.This book has forced me to come forward and hopefully help those of you who are thinking of buying this one. I would have given you mine but I left it in the hotel room so the maid staff can enjoy it.
1,Just plain bad,"I have read all of Tom Clancy's books, but the Bear and the Dragon is just bad. 3 reasons made me not finish this book.1) Repeated harsh ethnic slurs against the chinese. How many times can you read ""chink"" ""slant"" or ""barbarians"" before one gets really offended. Makes me think that Clancy really doesn't like the Chinese. Never heard him talk about the Russians like that in his other books when they were the enemy.2) Clancy has made Ryan into a whining cry-baby. All he ever does is complain about government and the fact that people don't call him by his first name.3) Just plain boring.Sorry to say that this book not up to par with Clancy's other novels. I really enjoyed them all up to Rainbow Six, which I found to be only OK."
4,Maybe abridged was a good choice,"Since The Bear and the Dragon was the first fiction audio cd I have listened to, I was worried that I wouldn't like an abridged story. It sounds like it was the better choice for this particular Clancy work though. From what other reviewers are saying, the hardcover was filled with repetitive minutaeu not really necessary to the storyline. I can't speak for the quality of the full hardcover novel, but as an abridged audio cd I thought The Bear and the Dragon was good, maybe even my second favorite Clancy story behind The Cardinal of the Kremlin."
1,From Taut Thrillers to Dull Diatribes,"Clancy used to pen a good yarn, though his characters were always undeniably shallow. Loved his tech focus, the thoroughness of his research, and his ability to weave them together.However, Bear & Dragon continues his trend toward political pontification. I'm more interested in how the US acquires and acts upon intelligence gained in Asia than I am in Clancy's views on abortion and the environment. (I can always tune into Fox TV news for a dose of conservative dogma).Clancy has also fallen down on his research: his descriptions of life in China range from outdated to innaccurate to painfully uninformed. As a former resident of Taiwan, China and Hong Kong, I can say there was plenty of room for better research. And he could definitely spare his readers the racial slurs. It's obvious that Clancy, and all his characters, hate Asians. If he can't overcome that bigotry, he could keep it to himself. It would make for a far better read."
3,Ghost Writer?,"I can't believe that Tom Clancy wrote this book. Whoever wrote it doesn't seem to know or love Clancy's marvelous characters. (Also, as an aside, Smokey Bear does not work for the Secretary of the Interior. He is in the Forest Service, which is part of the USDA.)"
2,Give me Strategy and keep the Partisan Politics,"Don't get me wrong, I did read the latest book from cover to cover, and could not put it down. I did get tired of Jack Ryan's extra conservative political views. I guess it should be expected since he is Catholic and he is President now. I miss the old days when he could be a neutral player and a great good guy, but when he complains about evolution, abortion, and gay rights, I get kind of tired of it. I hope that the next book tones it down. There were pages that I skimmed right through, because they were boring details that did not add to the plot or excitement. I love TC books, but this was not anywhere near as good as W. Honor or Rainbow. I hope that the trend reverses itself and that I look forward to rereading his newer books as much as I do his older ones."
2,Boooring...and waay too long....,"I agree with most of the other reviews here. I am a big Clancy fan but it has become apparent in his last few books that he has begun to take himself a little too seriously. I have had this book for at least three weeks and I am still having a hard time getting past the first 300 pages. The techno-geek stuff that was so much fun in the past is almost totally absent. Now all we hear about is politics. And if you don't think Clancy is rambling on and on about his own political beliefs, well.....His books just aren't much fun anymore, I'm sorry to say. I think I'll go back to a nice fast-paced Patterson or Koontz novel <sigh>."
2,A Book too far !!!,"Clancy's beauty is his knowledge of technology. His descriptions of military hardware and its uses are the reason i read his books.He's become enamored with the spy business, much as W.E.B. Griffin did in his Semper Fi series. I really never did believe that the Marine Corps founded the CIA. If I want spies, I'll read Ludlum.Rainbow Six was bad, this book is punishment. Don't buy it and maybe Clancy will go back to what he knows. 800 pages of set-up for the war that everybody knows is coming."
2,Too Long and Too Morally Preachy,It's bad enough that Tom Clancy feel like he has to bring back every living character from his previous books and tell their story again but in this book he also dishes out his feelings on Bill Clinton and Abortion.If he could just have a few characters retire or maybe get killed in action he could cut out about 200 pages.Also it's so obvious that he is taking swipes at Clinton that it gets annoying. I'm not a Clinton fan either but enough is enough. Levae the morality out of it.Cardinal of the Kremlin is still the worst Clancy book but this one is down there with it.
2,Completely Unreadable,"As a long-time fan of Tom Clancy, I find myself incredibly disappointed with his latest offering, The Bear and the Dragon. Weighing in at just over 1,000 pages, the book is filled with page after page of ""thoughts"" as opposed to good, old-fashioned dialog-""thoughts"" so replete with poorly written, misogynistic, right-winged conservative diatribes that it renders the book all but unreadable.I can't help but thinking that 1) Clancy has completely lost touch with the reality in which the rest of us live, and 2) the man is simply using his novels as a pulpit from which he can preach his views and beliefs. I encourage everyone to save their money and look elsewhere for a good thriller."
2,Tom: Find a good editor -- SOON!,"This is an example of a good first draft. TC needs to find a good editor and streamline the story. B&G is at least 200 pages too long. The dialog is trite and adolescent...not worthy of the adults in the story. If TC wants to advance his political agenda, he should involve himself in politics. But to make his characters his voice is boring after awhile, and ultimately useless, because I skip over those parts. The Jack Ryan of Red October would slap Jack Ryan of B&G for whining so much.It would serve a better purpose to write 200-300 pages of an encyclopedia of characters and events. I didn't have the luxury of re-reading the last five TC books to prepare for B&G, so I missed out on some of the references. At the very least, use a few pages of the current novel to tell us where and how we first met these characters.The last 200 pages -- the battle -- are standard, enjoyable, Clancy. If you can survive the first 800 pages, then you have earned your treat."
4,Elaborate plot with good execution,"Seems like every Clancy novel is getting more elaborate and therefore longer. While I found that the characterizations aren't that deep in The Bear & The Dragon, Clancy spends a lot of time on the main plot, which is concerning China's desire to rule the world and how they might go about accomplishing it. Also, Clancy spends a lot of time on subplots and overall the story is well executed. I didn't like the excessive use of foul language which is absolutely unnecessary and it spoiled the book to some degree. Anyway, reading this Clancy is an experience. Another new thriller that features a possible China world domination scenario, but is faster paced than Clancy, and it is a very informative book, although it's plenty of entertaining, is the loaded action thriller THE CONSULTANT by Alec Donzi."
1,Generic,"Why is it that seemingly every english speaking person on earth has a copy of this novel sitting on their bookshelf?Possibly the most bland, formulaic, unrealistic novel i have ever read. It constantly feels as though it is about to end, before you realise you still have 500 pages to go. It drags on and on.Tom Clancy writes like every other novelist in this genre, if indeed he does write the majority of his own books.This is trashy fiction in the extreme masquerading as something of a higher quality. There is no thinking involved. The 'what if' scenario of a Chinese invaision of Russia is about as far as this mediocre mass stretches the imagination, which is slightly less than your average 'Mr Men' installment.The number of hours i spent reading this book would have been better spent writing a book of equal volume about all varieties of paint ever conceived.Nausiatingly dull. The same as every other book he has ever written."
2,Not his best,"Like most Clancy fans, I anxiously awaited his new book. Needless to say, it was pretty disappointing. The juvenile language between the Foley characters was sickening and it was difficult to try and connect any of the bazillion subplots. I got through nearly 400 pages but I think I'm going to put this one down for awhile. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle that he was no John Kennedy. ""The Bear and the Dragon"" is no ""Executive Orders."" Hopefully, the next Ryan book will be better!."
3,Tree Killer 2 - Where was the book?,"Typical Clancy fair is buried in this book, hi-tech weapon systems, clever spys and counter-spys, tension filled chases. Unfortunately it is surrounded by lots, and I mean a LOT of crap. In particular we get treated to Clancy prosetlyzing on abortion, race relations, human rights, and even the difficulties of being President. There is a GREAT 350 page book in here somewhere, surrounded by another 700 pages of useless verbosity. Why did I slog through it? Because I was on an airplane that was going to be in the air 10 hrs and sleeping was out of the question. If you must read this book, borrow it from a friend or check it out from the library. Someone needs to give Clancy's editor a better shot at cutting out the parts of the book that don't contribute to the story."
2,How Obvious can you get?,"Granted that it's always easy to promote a book when your publishing company invest ton of money on a sure winner (like any Clancy book) you can expect ""raving"" reviews from the media and some type of readers.But, nay, this is not literature: is a gigantic salad of common places, a mixture of techno blurb and doubtful scenarios, of very obvious data, and a plot thar was written by a word processor filled with not more than 1000 words.It's really amazing that this post cold war, pre new century nouvelle (I do not care that it sports more than 1K pages) finds its place in the world, and that it will make money for Clancy,.DO yourself a favour and please switch to a real book"
3,"Good, but not great","Very much a Clancy thriller, but not the techno-thrillers like his earlier works. While the first 700 pages are a bit of a drag at times, the final 300 pages move at a nice clip. Too bad the conclusion is a bit similiar to another of his earlier books. (His other recycled idea involves the press being in the right place at the right time, setting the stage for world opinion.) Maybe if the first part was limited to 300 pages and the last to 700 pages, this might have been another great Clancy story.Though satisfied with the overall story and writing, the Jack Ryan character is becoming rather unlikeable, unless you're a die-hard right wing, old school GOP, card carrying, gun totting grumpy old man.By far, Clancy's worst effort in an especially great story line."
3,Definetly not one of his best books,"I preordered this book in February, and could not wait to get my hands on it. When I finally did, I was somewhat disappointed. The dialogue is not the same as in his other books. The characters are weak. The plot is great, but the treatment of countries and people is not. Overall a good read, but a disappointment for a true Clancy fan."
1,Bear and the Dragon Drags On,"All of his books are too long and this one is waaaaaaay to long. In the past, I didn't care because I would just scan through much of his rambling because the bottom line was the books were enjoyable. But this one is boring. Once the action finally starts, around page 750, the passages are wordy and without any real imagination. Does Clancy get paid by the word?Lastly, we all know he is a conservative Republican but the inclusion of his political views so many times was uncalled for.The writer of ""Patriot Games"" and ""A Clear and Present Danger"" is taking himself way to seriously has apparently killed the Golden Goose."
2,"Too long, too little, nothing new",It is very disappointing to write a poor review on a Clancy novel. One of my favorite authors. The good is that you get to renew all the characters of the previous books that have not been killed off and you enjoy. The story line is disappointing in that it is almost a rehash of the last books with different villians. The most disappointing is even though the book is 1000 pages none of the characters has enough of a central theme to identify with unless they are old friends from previous readings. There were pages upon pages of preaching on all kinds of issues somewhat akind to Ann Rand (Atlas Shrugged). Hope he can find the forumula if there is a next book.
3,Making Bricks Without Straw,"Clancy enthusiasts may be disappointed with this tome. It is not that the story is less well-told - Clancy has lost none of his talent in that respect - it is more a matter of there being less to tell. Admittedly, since the collapse of the Evil Empire, writers of techno-thrillers have been hard up to find reliable, competent villains, but there is still lots of evil around, and up to now Clancy has been able to articulate it in an interesting and believable fashion. Upon putting the book down, I expect most readers will agree that he should have let the Chinese H-bomb explode!"
2,Bulked up on repetition,"As a fan of Tom Clancy's Red Storm Rising, Hunt for Red October, and Executive Orders, I've always loved the detail given to his plots and characters. So when I bought the book, I figured its size was due to another intricate plot.Instead, what I got was a bulked up story filled with retreads of statements made in the older books and repetitive quotes from the characters(How many times do I have to be reminded that widows of the condemned are charged for the executioner's bullet?!?), and blatantly racist remarks. I do not recommend this book."
2,Slow reading,"Usually I cannot put down a Tom Clancy book but this one I can read 30 or 40 pages and then go on to something else I have to do. It is very very wordy. The text repeats itself in several of the chapters. I found myself flipping through the book trying to follow the plot to the end, I have not finished reading this book, I may never do so with the joy I had with other Clancy novels. I agree with other reviewers when they stated one gets tired of Jack Ryan griping about being president. I like the character but this is to much, not realistic. The book so far has been a disappointment. I should have purchased the audio tape, then I would have gotten the story without all the endless words of dialogue."
3,Disappointing Research,"I was disappointed with Clancy for his lack of research. In the first few chapters he mentions people being paid with euros for a job and the Vice President giving a speech at Long Beach Naval Shipyard. The euro was introduced in January 1999, the LB Naval Shipyard was closed in September 1997 and was mostly leveled by the time the euro was introduced."
2,He crammed 200 pgsof information into 700 pgs of type.,The first 700 pages were mostly boring - developing each character way too much. All kinds of subplots that have little or nothing to do with the main book. If I didn't have a lot of time on my hands following surgery I would have put the book down long ago. Don't waste your money on this one.
4,Not quite up to the previous standards,"I will be the first one to admit that I am a huge Clancy fan, I buy all of his books the day they come out. While doing a great job of manipulating the readers emotions over the happenings in Communist China, the book does seem overly long, with a rushed ending. I would have liked to see some of the loose ends wrapped up better. There were a lot of typos in this book. With as much money as Putnam is going to make off of this book at $28.95 per copy, pay an editor (or run spell check for God's sake) before printing hundreds of thousands of them. The scenes with the Rainbow troopers were covered too lightly, and the bedroom scenes were covered too heavily. I can't complain about Clancy's political posturing, because I happen to share most of his views on politics. I really enjoyed this book, but it is not as good as his previous efforts."
3,"Interesting, but it goes on forever","My favorite Clancy novel is ""Clear and Present Danger."" His new book ""The Bear and the Dragon"" doesn't come close. In fact I didn't like the excessive foul language throughout the book. The story is still interesting, but it goes on forever. If Clancy would have used more contemporary locations for this thriller and not the traditional surroundings, it would have been a much better book. I'm sure this book is going to make a good movie, if they cut out the bad language. Based on a friend's recommendation I just read through another brand new thriller in this genre and I highly recommend it as it is fast paced, loaded with action, excellent plot, info and research and plausible scenarios, which is the explosive megathriller ""THE CONSULTANT"" by Alec Donzi."
1,Implausible Techno Shoot 'em Up,"Get an editor for the 1,000 plus pages of text containing repetitions of entire paragraphs, spelling errors and misuse of words. Get more thorough research on all countries that are central to the action.This book had the opportunity to educate Americans about the people and culture of the PRC, and increase international understanding of our differences and similarities. Instead, Clancy has shown us cliche mainland Chinese - and hasn't even gotten their names right! (Chinese keep the names they are born with all their lives, and they are said ""last name"" first.)Back to the drafting board, Tom!"
1,Oprah's Book Club For Men,"Okay, all of you...put the Clancy books down and step away from the cash register. I mean if he won't bother to write them, why should we be buying them? It's Oprah's Book Club for Men - ""Must...buy...new...Tom...Clancy...book"" Move on, you can sure tell he has. This is another dim-witted over-politicized, shallow thriller about our dear old Jack Ryan. The thing is, I feel really bad that Jack has to put up with being put in these situations again and again to sell books. I'll suspend disbelief, but Jack Ryan as President? Please. The early books were truly great, very gripping and fun to read, but God help me if I buy another one. Fool me once, shame on you...fool me 14 times... 5 to 1 the next book is ghost written."
1,The Boor and the Drag-on,"The last Tom Clancy book I will ever buy. After 100 pages I've ground to a halt. I can't take it any more.Tom, do yourself a favour: hire an editor. Hire 10 editors. Better yet, get yourself copies of JK Rowling's 'Harry Potter' books. Written for children, but light-years ahead of anything you can do."
2,Disapointing at best,"I started reading the Bear and the dragon as I was traveling in China. Someone should tell Mr Clancy that today's China is very different from the 80's USSR... I go to China quite often on business and nothing looks slightly familiar to what was described in this book. Government workers do not go to work in gray Mao style suits.....Every thing except thir state of mind is wrong. Anyway that being said, as I read the first chapter, I knew how the book would end up. The plot is predictible, Jack Ryan thoughts are predictible, the use of technology is not even as good as it used to be in the former Ryan series. What a disapointment, Mr Clancy is resting on his laurels trying to pass out his political agenda. Instead of writting mediocre books why doesnot he run for office. He seems to have all the answers..... The book is poorly documented, poorly written, it seems to me that Mr Clancy should retire with Jack Ryan."
3,Too Long,I love Clancy books but this one is 200 pages too long. That translates into severe predictability. There are no suprises anywhere in the book. The technical aspects are lacking also.
3,"OK, Not Great","This is one of Clancy's less exciting novels. He extends the Patrick Ryan set of characters, and they are good to spend time with again. The plot is less complicated than some of his earlier works. That's definitely a plus.He sets the story line within a strong moral framework, that I felt worked very well. Overall though, a bit too long, a bit too self-conscious. But still worth the read."
4,"Not on par for Clancy, but still a great book...","I have read all of Clancy's novels, and while I did enjoy this book, I think it was probably not his best. I feel that the Jack Ryan character has become a sort of ""cardboard-cutout,"" kind of 2 dimensional, flat hero figure. I think that the Ryan character has not really developed in the past few books written about him. However, despite that, the book is action-packed, and is as much fun to read as his other books. Clancy excells at depicting both close-quarters and battlefield combat, and his realism has never been better. It is great that he can also bring the Rainbow group into the novels, so it is not just all Jack Ryan. While I would have given his other novels 5 stars, I must give this one 4, which is not bad at all..."
4,America Prevails,"even though it was a very long read,with lots of buildup I still found it a good book. The plot building to war was a very good one that would be possible, the positions taken by the countrys were beleiveable, and the ultimate conclussion was quite probable. It was lengthy and the true action was in the last 300 pages, but the Jack Ryan ""John Wayne"" style was visable and made for a good read of fiction."
1,"Ryan, the reactionary","Yes, this book develops too slowly, but when it finally begins to show its true colors, it gets pretty ugly. I stopped reading this book on page 183. That's when President Ryan spews forth all of Clancy's anti-abortion rhetoric to the less than convincing arguments of his chief of staff.This is Clancy's last war for this reader. I'll leave him 845 pages from the next treaty and long before he sends the world to war once again."
2,Very Slow read,"I have been an avid Tom Clancy fan since ""The Hunt for Red October."" I have read all of his single-author books and many of the earlier books for which he is a co-author, but I had to really work to read this book. I must admit that I was not greatly impressed by ""Rainbow Six"" when I noticed an increased tendency for Clancy to include more foul language than he had in earlier works. One thing I miss is his clean concise writing and character action and development. I felt like I could read his books and enjoy their inherent complexities and character development without having to work my way through character after character swearing with and at each other. This book also delves into sexual encounters quite early.I greatly enjoy Clancy's other books, but this book is a very bad read. You may call the dialog in this book reality, but I can do without it in my pleasure reading."
4,Classic Clancy! Excellent Story.,"I have read all of Clancy's novels, and this one ranks right up there with his best. Although it is over 1000 pages, I never noticed. It is a very fast and exciting read and I highly recommend it to conservative, Clancy readers. Since Clancy deals with a lot of social and political issues - keep an open mind if you're not politically conservative. The only thing that would have made this a better novel is if Clancy had not rushed the ending. It seemed that he was trying to finish the book as quickly as possible and I think the book would have been better if it was not rushed, maybe around 1200 pages. Great read, though. I couldn't put it down."
1,Jingo Tom and the Magic Dragon,"Unbelievably I continued to read and finish this piece of garbage. Besides the incredible shallowness of the characters and the increase in profanity (I don't think Nixon swore this much) I continue to be deeply disturbed by the overt racism Jingo TC shows toward Asians (Chinese and Japanese in particular). Besides using ""Chinks"" and ""slant eyes"" as descriptive terms he tries to cover up by making nice talk toward African Americans...sorry can't buy the rich white Baptist Minister trading pulpits with Rev. Jackson in Mississippi...things haven't changed that much in the south...don't know where Tom does research but it isn't below the Mason Dixon. His making the Russians our good buddies now only reinforces the fact that caucasians of any flavor can be trusted and other races are demonic little yellow people.TC needs to grow up and get a new career...this one isn't working."
2,Mr. Clancy Does it Again...Too Bad,"Once again Mr. Clancy has crammed a good 400-500 page book into 1,000 pages. While I devoured The Hunt for Red October, Red Storm Rising, Cardinal...etc, I have found his last 3 works major disappointments. I actually cried when the US sub sunk in Red Storm Rising. Now, I would be happy is someone would ask Mr. Clancy to sit down and be quiet and let Mr. Ryan or one of his minions DO something other than pontificate on ultra conservative, right wing, table pounding non-issues."
1,Hopelessly dull...500 pages too long,"A couple chapters into this book it becomes apparent Clancy is coasting on his name and reputation. This book is WAY overwritten. At over 1000 pages, it's a test of endurance to keep turning the pages. Clancy lays down page after page of irrelevant macho jargon when really he should be developing something resembling a plot. It's a mystery to me how anyone could stay interested in this book long enough to finish it. Hey Tom, cut the next one down to 550 pages and maybe I'll consider reading it."
1,"Yak, yak, yak.","I put it down after struggling through 600 pages of talk, talk, talk. A big disappointment after waiting for the next Jack Ryan story."
1,What a shame!,"What a shame, what a pitty!As a huge fan of all Tom Clancy wrote (fictional), I longed to get my hands on his latest work (I had to wait quit some time for it in the Netherlands). Well, I have it now, and what a disappointment it is!To be brief: Mr. Clancy is getting old and grumpy and uses his writing to express his rather boring, old fashioned and conservative political ideas. This must even be a bore for any US reader, but for an international reader it's like reading a 1100 page column in a local small town USA newspaper.Oh, by the way, this book actually features a story somewhere between the lines. And yes, all our favourite characters are in it. It's a shame they are used as background figures."
1,A decent author gone south,"Having read most of Tom Clancy's earlier works, I was sorely disappointed by this effort. In fact, I felt cheated. Where in the past Tom Clancy has written books with a good plot and exciting action, this book spends a great amount of time on Clancy's sexist, xenophobic and otherwise unecessary political views. This large tome (1000+ pages) could have been toned down to a few hundred if these distracting comments had been omitted. I would not recommend this book for anyone."
1,Racism and tiresome main character sink this book,"I have read every Tom Clancy book since the beginning. Everyone knows his strengths and weaknesses, so there aren't many surprises. I do expect to be entertained by his books, but I wasn't this time. I simply can't stomach the endless racist remarks; Executive Orders got by with only a few references to ""ragheads"" to refer to people of the Islamic faith. Here, however, there are constant and ongoing racist and cultural slurs against Chinese people (I won't dignify them by repeating them). Also, Jack Ryan has become incredibly tiresome. He has turned into a self-righteous, ultra-right-wing character who loathes anyone who disagrees with him and spends all his time whining about how he doesn't want to be President. It's time for Clancy to move on from this series and get back to writing entertaining thrillers with interesting characters."
1,"Tom Clancy's worst, boring predictable drivel.","Tom Clancy's works where always known for having all the little things go the right way for his hero's, but in this book he takesit too the extreme. He spends too much time and effort into demonizing the PRC, harkens back to the Fu Manchu racist stereotypes of old. And the war at the end (as every other reviewer states it takes how many pages to get to that?) comes off as far too easy. Predictable, I yearn for Clancy's days of old Red Storm Rising and such..."
1,My last Clancy book,"It would be hard for me to improve on the several hundred other reviews of this book, so I'll just hit the lowlights:1) The book is waaaaay too long for what little ""content"" there is. Clancy definitely needs an editor.2) Clancy has gotten waaaaay too preachy, using every inconsequential shred of dialog (and there are many) as an excuse to inform the reader of his view of ""how things should be done.""3) The story is too contrived. He really has to try hard to make this one believable and fails miserably.4) Clancy's prose (if you can call it that) is ridiculous and, in many parts, dwells way too much on parts of the male anatomy.'tis a far cry from Hunt for Red October. You'd really have to try hard to write a worse book than this."
2,FORGOTTEN THE RULES!,"The basic rule of the thriller apart from good characterization is the tautness of plot, that is that every paragraph, every page should advance the story. Sadly Tom Clancy seems to have forgotten this and treats us to a 700 page preamble that had me wondering if I should sign up to save the rain forests. The paper used in the last third of the story was worthwhile and that's about the best I can say for it. Even so I often wonder how such works receive such tremendous critical acclaim - it is no different here in Britain or the rest of Europe. For anyone interested in how you write and produce a work far superior to this and in half the pages I urge you to read English techno-thriller writer John Templeton Smith's 'White Lie' - JTS is one of the most underrated of writers, but then we Brits haven't got a clue about marketing. In the meanwhile, may I respectfully suggest that you wait for Harrison Ford in the movie (I'm a big fan of the popcorn!)"
1,The Bear and the Dragon,This is first Clancy book that I could not only put down but also the only one I didn't care whether I picked it up again or not. The story moved so slowly and some parts had so little to do with the plot I got bored reading. I could only recommend this book to someone having trouble sleeping at night. I will have a difficult time convincing myself to buy his next book.
1,the bear and the dragon,"I have read most of what clancy has written and in this case, feel he has out done himself in delaying the action in order to provide himself with a forum for his conservative views.Of the 1024 odd pages, the action didn't start until I had fought my way through at least 720 pages of really boring dialogue dealing with issues such as Jack Ryan's views on Roe V Wade. To me ,everything has a place and clancy's views on that subject do not belong in an adventure novel, fiction at that. Whether I agree with clancy's views or not I bought the book for pleasure not to listen to his political opinions. Once the action started , I don't feel he was writing at the level of ""A RED STORM RISING"" OR ""RED OCTOBER"". Those stories had you right in the action racing to the next page.it didn't happen here."
1,Total disappointment,"I had read all Clancy's books, and I am so naive to think that he always did a detail research before he writes.I had no problem with the plot, I throw this book away without finishing it because I know that Mr. Clancy have not visit china or meet and talk with any chinese for the last 15 years. It's a pity that I had to give this book ONE Star to show this review."
2,The Longest Book,"Clancy's first and maybe best ""Hunt for Red October"" was 382 pages, the story was tight and exciting, ""Bear & Dragon"" is 1028 pages, about 3x necessary to tell the story, tell us Tom does Putnam pay by the pound?"
1,"POTUS ? SWORDSMAN? Jack Ryan ? Oh Please, Give me a break...","I struggled through the first 180 or so pages of this very very excrucitaing book. I did not mind the endless repetitions, the unworthy whines of POTUS(!), very loose, very offensive, very vulgur way the whole darn globe was talking..did not even mind the racial coloring of the book...But then along came Jack Ryan alias POTUS alias SWORDSMAN complaining about ABORTION....That was the moment I tossed the book away. I mean what the hell has that got to do with Chinese attacking Russia ? And who wants a president that whines his days off.. I could not believe it was the same Jack Ryan. May be movie makers should consider Anthony Hpokins (a la Remains Of the Day) instead of Harry this time- if some one is incredibly stupid to make a mpvie based upon this pile of junk that is. If you havn't read this book yet - SAVE YOURSELF THE AGONY ! All the bad reviews about this book are right. I wish i had read them BEFORE i wasted my money on this book."
1,Cardinal of the Crap-lin,"""Not his best work"" is being generous. I've been a Tom Clancy fan since I first read ""Red Storm Rising"" while deployed along the Inner-German Border at the height of the Cold War. But this is easily the worst Clancy I've ever read. The editing is horrendous, if there was editing at all. The sexual innuendo is laughable at best, and totally unnecessary. The plot lines drag along with no apparent direction or cohesion. To top it off, it appears that Clancy's main goal was to include every character that had ever appeared in a Ryan novel - except Marko Ramius, I think. And the abrupt ending just left me cold. Bottom line - it's not worth the effort to read. I struggled through it, hoping to see the Clancy of old. He's not there. Don't waste your time. Better to pick up a Dirk Pitt novel by Clive Cussler - at least there's some excitement."
2,Longer isn't necessarily better,"For the first time, a Tom Clancy novel is dragging me as a reader. And, getting dragged over 1000-plus pages of mediocre story telling is really chafing. The spelling mistakes are annoying and all these knowing looks between Jack Ryan and his crowd is cloying. The good guys are too good and almost cartoonishly overdrawn; the bad guys are too bad and paper thin. The Bear and the Dragon doesn't measure up in terms of pace, suspense or character development with my Clancy favorites: Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin, and Clear and Present Danger. Do I detect that Tom is tired of this line of novels? After reading The Bear and The Dragon, I'm thinking I will not be rushing out, as I did last week for this one, for the next Clancy novel. I'm disappointed."
5,THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON,"I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY CLOSE TO REALITY. IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME TO GET TO KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IN THE NOVEL, BUT THE TIME IS WELL SPENT. CLANCY BRINGS TO LIGHT A LOT OF ISSUES THE WORLD SHOULD BE CONCERNED WITH ABOUT TWO ECONOMICALLY STRUGLING NATIONS AND THEIR DEALINGS WITH THE WESTERN NATIONS OF THE WORLD."
4,Excellent,"Tom Clancy keeps them coming, book after book. From military expertise to government politics, to thirld world terrorism, this book has it all. I'm waiting on the next one!"
1,No credibility,Tom Clancy's recent book is not match compared to Red October. The Bear and the Dragon offers a political plot that is hardly convincing and a military story that cannot be believed.
1,Objectionable Language,"I have been a Clancy fan ever since his first book. I eagerly awaited The Bear and Dragon because I had really gotten into these characters. I had to stop reading less than half way through the book. The language was consistently foul and just that, foul language. The story was extremely interesting and I did try to stay with it; the language intruded so much I finally quit because it was overriding the story. I have no objection to strong language when it helps the story; this does not. Language in the military and in government office circles is not as depicted by Clancy. I will not be buying another of his books (and I own all the others)."
2,Disappointed,"Read a lot of Clancy and regardless of whether I enjoy them or not or thought they were somewhat slow, I could always count on his ability to get factual details, particularly with technical details correct. This book has significant errors that one does not expect from Tom Clancy. Seems that he has gotten lazy with his success and writes no better than the typical military-fiction types are writing today. Disappointed."
4,Pretty good.,"O.K. so it wasn't his best work ever. But it is still TC and he's the best. There were some things I could have done without (Ryan's whining about being President, Japanese sausage). But still it's classic Clancy and worth buying. In fact, I had a hard time studying for some finals because I was busy reading Clancy."
4,Not Enough Credit Being Given Here,"Having read a number of reviews, I couldn't help but wonder if the people writing them read the same book that I did. Is this the best Clancy novel that I have read? No. However, it is a good read and continues the story. I agree with some other reviewers that we know that Jack is not into being the President and that is overstated in the book. Does Tom Clancy give us a believable plot in The Bear and the Dragon? Yes. Does he give us the bad guys that we love to see taken out? Yes. He also give us the delightful little sub-plots that make it work for me. You don't have to like the politics of Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy), but if your like me, you don't think there is much wrong with Jack's ideas! If you are looking for Cardinal in the Kremlin, this one may not be for you, but if you are looking to a logical extension of the Jack Ryan saga and a book that keeps you in it, this one fits the bill."
2,VERBOSE and opinionated,"Tom Clancy has been reading too much of his own press. He still can write a good story but now he has to add his irrelevant opinion wherever possible. ""Tree huggers"" and clinton references abound. This book is much too long and should have been about half the size."
2,"2 out of 5. Must try harder, Tom!","I am a big fan of Clancy, Clear and Present Danger is awesome, but with The Bear and The Dragon Clancy appears to have stopped trying. Compared to his previous novels this plot is predictable and lacking in his usual cunning twists. I found myself waiting for something unexpected to happen but it never did. I know Tom is a patriot but I don't think one American soldier died in the entire book! He repeated himself far too often. Yes Jack I know you hate this job, it's the fifth time you have told me. I understand! At one point Clancy says that even scratching an American warship is tantamount to war. That's funny. Someone blew a hole in one the other day without retribution. I think there is a bit too much of how Clancy would like America to be as opposed to how it, and the world, really is. Still, if you like Clancy it's worth a read. I just hope this is only a smudge on an otherwise fantastic career."
3,A six hundred page novel crammed into a thousand pages,"I have been reading Tom Clancy since Naval Institute Press published The Hunt for Red October. It is sad to see his writing getting progressively worse. He still does action sequences as well as anyone, and he still puts care into plotlines leading up to these sequences. He also tends to insert irrelevant political tracts, sections of character-building which essentially repeat the same passage from fifty pages previous, and long drawn out bits of plot development which are not really necessary nor particularly interesting. What he needs is a good editor, but his publisher is unwilling or unable to do edit his books effectively. The result is that as his books get larger we get more of what he is bad at rather than what he is good at. After Rainbow Six I was giving him one last chance, and he failed. We are better off re-reading Patriot Games or Cardinal of the Kremlin, written at Clancy's peak."
3,"Conservative, not realistic of the real world","Tom Clancy never served in uniform but continues to write books about those who did. While one can do this in fiction with a certain amount of research, it seems as if success has gone to his head. Special Operations soldiers are not as he portrays them. I heard Clancy speak at Ft. Campbell, KY addressing members of Task Force 160 (the Nightstalkers) and 5th Special Forces Group and he was condescending to the very men he writes his fiction about. If you want real spec ops fiction, read the Brit Andy McNabb's SAS books; Bob Mayer's Special Forces stories; heck, even Dick Marcinko is more realistic than this. No slam on the author personally, but let's differentiate between fact and fiction and what one knows and has lived."
3,Not For Everyone,"This book will not be enjoyable to liberals, pin head elites and most women. It tells a story from a middle class man's point of view, and since that is where I am, I enjoyed it. Certainly not a great read, too many characters with foreign names which are difficult to remember and a little long winded. I suggest writing the Russian and Chinese characters down until you get a feel for the main characters. The real action starts in the middle of the book and that is around the 500 mark in pages. Yes, this is a long read, and not for everyone, but again, I enjoyed the story."
1,Spammed by Author,I will not read this novel under any circumstances. I got spammmed by this author. i did not ask for any e-mails from this person. I think the author ought to look at other ways of commericaially adveritising.
3,i recommend another book......,"i highly recommend another book -- entitled ""JULIA'S MOTHER"" -- about an ER doctor working at a children's hospital -- SO beautifully written, so poignant .... i couldnt put it down, didnt want it to end ....."
2,OMG,"Pick a 1 or 2 review and it covers this book. I have read several of Clancy's books and this one was terrible. Conservative PC none stop and at 1000+ pages a drudge to read. I mean why do you need to put a 10 page Baptist sermon in the book? I grew up a Baptist and they do go on too longbut these two were simply padding to Clancy's belief that it's his way or you are bad. The hero is always superman with some help from wonder women and come in White, black, and Asian types. The bad guys are murdering sexual perverts with no redeeming characteristics. A nice simply world where the hero doesn't know where food comes from. Adds may pages of anti-abortion rhetoric and the opinion that American schools need ruler welding nuns to get a good education. I wasted $4.00"
2,Clancy Trails Off,"An avid Clancy fan, I pre-ordered this book, waited patiently. The result, disappointment. This book does not seem like it was even written by Clancy. The prose is different from his other books. The plot is disjointed. Maybe Clancy is too busy. I hope the next one is better. Otherwise, the next one may be the last I read."
1,Bear and the Dragon just couldn't be the work of Clancy,"Having read all of Clancy's novels (Many several times over), I was sorely let down with The Bear and The Dragon. The crudeness displayed by my favorite author really knocked me out of the box. His previous efforts have always lent themselves to trying to explain the thought processes of ""The enemy"" (Soviets, Druggies, Eco-terrorists, the IRA, or radical Arab elements, etc.) and what America, in the guise of Jack Ryan or John Clark, should do to counter them. But other than stating outright that the Chinese just plain think different than we do, he simply denegrates the novel by resorting to name calling. ""Joe Chink"" and ""Japanese Sausage""....please! This is the first of his novels that I would not recommend on any level. It appears to have been ghost written by a name-calling, racist and not the strategic thinking techno-novelist that I've long admired."
2,That's the last of my money Tom Clancy will get,"If you didn't know Tom Clancy's personal politics going into this book you will know them afterwards. I tend to lean to the right, but the numerous references to Clinton/Lewinsky go too much even for me, especially considering there was never a Bill Clinton in Clancy's alternate universe.This book was needlessly long. Without the constant melancholy reflections by President Jack Ryan about how his life had changed and what a prison the White House is this would have been a couple hundred pages shorter. Another hundred pages could have been trimmed from the predictable military engagement described in ultra-technical detail at the end of the book. We believe you know alot about military hardware, Tom (after all, someone gave you that nifty captain's baseball cap in your picture), now give us a break..."
2,"Tom Clancy is my favorite writer, but","Tom Clancy is by far my favorite writer, but this book lacks something. I have been trying to finish it since November. To me, the story line is too far-fetched, and we have talked about going to war for over 700 pages before we actually do it. I don't know yet how it ends, and I may never know at the rate it is going. It is a disappointment for me."
1,The worst Clancy ever,"If you have read the last eight Clancy novels, prepare for a disappointment. In contrast to his other work, this one is full of stereotypes and predictable throughout. It does have some suspense, so you keep reading and waiting for the major plot to begin. There is none. I just felt bad afterwards - it's a waste of time. This book reads as if written by a ghostwriter, not Clancy himself."
1,This book was HORRIBLE!,"Don't waste your money. I wish I hadn't.If you want a good read, go for Red Storm Rising. Even if you've read it before, you will still find it WAY more interesting than this onslaught of Clany's verbal diarrhea."
2,"Like running through deep, wet cement...","I have been a huge fan of Tom Clancy since high school. Red October was the first 'non-required' novel I read. I have come to appreciate the detail he works into his plots, but this was rediculous. The first 500 pages were not only slow, but boring. I got tired of hearing how Jack Ryan hated being President, how much Nomuri enjoyed having sex, and how much money everybody could be making if they did not work for the Government. Slow, redundant, painful. Keep this one in the bathroom and work through it over the next year."
2,Page long paragraphs,"About 200 pages of real ""book"" in about a thousand. Paragraphs nearly a page in length with more than one subject. Just plain bad grammar. A sorry atempt at expressing a philosophy - on everything from religion to mushy politics. And those 4 letter words! Sick and more than enough. My first and last Clancy book."
2,Clancy's Bizarre World View,"I give this book two stars only because it is slightly better than the completely ridiculous Rainbow Six. Now Clancy has Jack Ryan as the military dictator of the U.S.; he is able to make alliances and join a war with nary a mention of Congress. Given Clancy's obvious love of the Rush Limbaugh view of America, this may not be surprising, but it doesn't make for a very good book. There are some good, if farfetched, descriptions of battle, although it is hard to believe the Chinese would be quite as stupid as Clancy would like us to think. As much as Clancy wants us to think of Ryan as a right-thinking hero, he seems not to realize what a fascistic character he has created, one whose own stupidity and unilateral actions lead to a nuclear threat to Washington, D.C. The hope that the Clancy of Red October will ever return seems utterly forlorn."
1,Bad news bear,"This is the worst Clancy book I have read. I have read them all. The only thing I can say is that the same person who wrote Cardinal in The Kremlin or Hunt for the Red October could not have writte this nonsense. A waste of good paper. Do not waste your money on this book. It is clearly written by the same ghost writers who do the OpCenter tripe. This is the most obvious, boring, dragged out plot of any novel I have read in a long time (and I read a lot). Save yourself the time and money and pass on this one."
1,Clancy's dud,"This is TC worst book to date. His characters are not developed and as usual he repeats the same thing over and over which does not develop the story. The worst part is that he paints Ryan and the USA as all good guys with the best toys. Not to give away the ending but to only lose 1 Tomcat while defeating all of China is the most preposterous thing imagined. I also got sick and tired of reading how Ryan hated to be president.To add insult to injury (not to mention price of book), TC felt obligated to make references to Bill Clinton's presidential woes. TC also felt, as seen in his recent books, a need to get on his personal pulpit, to expound his beliefs, whether religious, abortion, or otherwise. I wish he had just developed the story with the kind of vigor he used in expousing his personal beliefs. Definitely a waste of time."
3,Not the best not the worst,"I remember the first Clancy book I ever read, Red Storm Rising. Now that was a book! Action from the first chapter. I'ver read every Clancy novel since, a first day buyer for every one. I've now slogged through all 1028 pages of Bear/Dragon. Like Patriot Games, it drags in the middle, but the middle is longer. Unlike Patriot Games, its ""big bang"" beginning is really tedpid. Lots of stupid Chinese leaders, lots of smart American leaders, nifty wind up (the pay off starts on page 773.) Not as good as Rainbow Six, not as as bad as Without Remourse, certainly not as bad as ""Into the Storm."" Tom! Give us more action and less sex! We love you babe!"
1,Asleep at the wheel,"I can't believe that other reviewers are rating this highly. It really falls down with respect to his other books.Weaknesses:* Other books (particularly Cardinal of the Kremlin) have elaborate spy-counterspy operations. In this one, an overtly foreign agent walks in and finds crown jewels completely unguarded. Unbelievable. Also, does China really let foreign news vans drive around unmonitored?* Russia is given a free pass on Chechnya and the Mafia, even as China's lack of respect for human rights is savaged, in order to justify the plot.* Several characters repeat the same aphorisms and quotations to the point where it's distracting. None of the quotations are attributed, an odd lapse for a detail man like Clancy.To me it looks like Clancy's suffering from the grandiosity that many writers of ongoing series fall into. I thought his switch to John Clark in Without Remorse and Rainbow Six was a cure for that, but apparently not."
2,Unremarkable in every way possible,"Numerous plot lines come together too easily, others go completely negelected. Racism and sexism abound. Clancy show complete ignorance of prenatal care and testing, which makes me question his mastery of other, more complex, issues. What a waste of 1,000 pages. Too bad, I really wanted to like this story."
3,Mediocre,"Clancy has written better novels than this.The plot is quite good, but the execution in places is often unimaginative. At times it was like reading 400 pages of prolog.Unlike previous Clancy works, this work is rather...graphic in places.The battle sequences are well done and very enjoyable.All in all, I wish I had waited for the paperback because this one will not remain in my library."
4,"Pretty good, but it's starting to get eerie","On the whole, i thought this was a rather good book. Clancy's reference to the Monica Lewinsky/Bill Clinton scandal helped to bring it more into the real world. Somthing i'd like to mention though; It is starting to be a little scary how the things Clancy write seem to come true... there have been discussion about Russia joining NATO, just as in The Bear and the Dragon. I can only hope that America comes out as well in the story of Operation Enduring Freedom as the country does in Clancy's novels. God Bless the USA and Bless our boys in uniform."
1,The Bear and the Dragon,What a bore; his worst book ever. Clancy clearly rules his pusilanimous editors (much as does Stephen King). Book is basically ill-concieved tripe that is poorly edited. Should have been perhaps 400 pages. Aegis cruiser shooting down ICBM!!?? PLEASE! The excessive expresion of his right-wing politics does little to help the narrative (or lack thereof). An insurance salesman is now telling us how we should deal with foreign policy and it is *ugly*. Please go fishing on the beautiful Bay and relearn how to write something like THFRO.
1,His worst effort to date,"I don't believe that Clancy even wrote this dog! The language could fade wallpaper, boring, boring, boring. Page 250 and the best I can say is I've had a wonderful eduation in the purchase of undergarments for Chinese women. If Tom did indeed pen this effort, looks to me like he's fresh outta ideas. A waste of money and time. Sorry."
5,Clancy scores again,"I was very surprised when I saw that the reviews for this book are mediocre. My opinion is that this is one of Clancy's best efforts, and even if you don't agree with that, I don't see how folks are saying it's one of his worst. I thought the storyline set the stage perfectly. Think it took too long? Well, did you LOOK at the book when you bought it? It's a miniature cinderblock! Of course, there's character and plot development galore, along with Clancy's usual detailed descriptions of military equipment and vehicles. And for folks who've found the politics of the characters (and through them, Clancy, to a degree) offensive, get over it. I don't think anyone is trying to argue that the events of the book would or will happen, but they COULD, given what we know about the leadership in communist goverments around the world. And the tantalizing thought that it COULD happen...well isn't that what great storytelling is all about?"
2,Vulgarity and style,"I, too, have read and bought all of Tom Clancy's books and enjoyed them. However, this novel was full of unnecessary vulgarity. His previous novels kept me riveted and expectant; I usually finished a book within 1 to 2 days. It seemed to me that he was trying to bring in another audience, maybe younger readers who like this type of vulgarity in their movies. It took me over a week and a half to read the book because it simply did not keep me expectant or anxious to follow all of the subplots and characters. This novel was way below the standard of Tom Clancy who I had considered the best novelist of our time. The ending left me irritated. I felt cheated out of his usual style and angry with the last few lines of text. I will, however, be awaiting another release by him and give him another chance to return to the top of my list."
3,good but not great,"READABLE but certainly not the best.my complaints are: the book is too long for no reason.also, too much jingoism!!! i love america too but give it a rest instead of every other page.too much love it or leave it stuff. though the plot was ok. not great but ok to read."
1,Don't Bother,"Don't bother reading this book even if you like Clancy novels--which I do. This example of longwinded, repetitive, pandering prose needs to be edited to two-thirds its current size. There isn't a redeeming character in the entire novel which is full of gratuitous profanity."
3,Too big for his britches,"If this were Clancy's first novel, he would still be selling insurance. Lots of needless repetition (did we really need to hear the dimensions of the CIA director's office twice?) At over 1000 pages, with lots of discussions on Ryan's (Clancy's?) views on abortion, politicians, the military and the diplomats, it could have used an editor with a sharp red pencil.That said, Clancy does know how to write. The last 200 pages were vintage work and a pleasure to read. Too bad I had to wade through the first 800 to get there."
2,Too much baggage,"The ""Ryan"" series is starting to suffer from too much ""historical"" baggage, and it shows in this book.Almost every character from the past Ryan books (except maybe Marko Ramius, unless I missed him) figures in this story, and the history of the Ryan timeline has diverged too far from reality for the story to be plausible.Pass on this one, or at least wait for the paperback."
4,Worth the Wait,"Although the book takes a while to get going, it is an entertaining read. The last 300 pages will keep you reading well into the night. Of all the technothriller novelists out there, Clancy is still the best."
2,"Mr. Clancy, please think of your female readers!","While the plot is good and we have quite a bit of Jack and his handling of the world, I was let down that there wasn't more of his home life which made EXECUTIVE ORDERS such a wonderful book. While I realize that Mr. Clancy's audience is mostly male, there are female readers who enjoy his stories and there would be more if he would include other things besides graphic descriptions of weapons and battles, which I admit I usually skim over. I also sprained my wrist trying to hold this book while I read it--it was extremely heavy. Maybe it could have been a tad shorter??"
2,somewhat disappointed,"Clancy fell short on this one! I saw him during a recent TV interview and said he hated to write. Well, looks like he put minimal effort into this one. Bear & Dragon was slighlty entertaining and just as boring! Could it be that Clancy is over the hill? I hope he regains his desire and talent because i normally look forward to his paperbacks."
1,How the mighty have fallen,Tom Clancy used to write really good books but his last few have been on a downhill trend. I gave up on this at page 196!
2,Clancy has been better.,"I have read all of Clancey's books starting with The Hunt for Red October. Unfortunately, this is not one of his better works. It is slow to develop, makes too many references to previous books, and asks the reader to believe a quite preposterous notion of the our Chinese friends. If I had to rank the Clancy books: 1) Hunt for Red October, 2) Patriot Games, 3) all of the rest, Last) Bear and the Dragon."
1,Clancy should write comic books,"Clancy is now like reading Clive Cussler, although Mr. Cussler doesn't try to pass himself off as writing anything other than adventure fantasy.Clancy has gone downhill since ""Hunt for Red October""--a truly wonderful and exciting read. Now, he writes these epic novels comprised of superficial plots, silly dialogue, 2 dimensional characters, a peppering of Clancy's own conservative political views, and way way way too many words.I have one word for Mr. Clancy: EDITOR. I read the first 10 percent of the book. Then I started to read the end of chapters and chapter sections. No one should be surprised that I missed nothing in the plot. Although I may have missed out on a few Tom Clancy political lectures as told by his alter ego President Ryan."
1,A cheap Jerry Furland imitation,"I have the upmost respect for Mr. Clancy's literary genius. I probably would not be a pawn shop owner if it were not for ""Cardinal of the Kremlin"". However, I have been compelled (out of respect for Mr. Jerry Furland, the author of the novel ""Transfer"") to offer my first ever negative critique of a Clancy novel. Mr. Clancy displayed a complete lack of scruples in stealing the story line from Transfer. It appears that Mr. Clancy's well has dried up and that he has lost his creative edge. Sad as this may be, I cannot condone, and will not stomach, the rape of Mr. Furland's novel."
2,Major disappointment in need of serious editing,"As you've probably read below (or will read in a moment), this one is a huge disappointment. All the elements are here for another great Clancy book, but it appears that he wouldn't listen to his editor. Tons of repetition and wheel-spinning. I should have just listened to an abridged version. Recommend that you do that instead."
2,The worst book Clancy has ever written,"The Bear and the Dragon is not worth reading. I found this out when I was about half way through the book but wanted to trudge on till the very end. Sure it has some good points, but is not nearly as good as all the others that I have read. I was disappointed, and agree with all the other negative reviews put forth here. I don't even know why I finished it, but I did, all 1028 pages worth."
3,Oh well...,"Spell-checking his German would have helped. Getting some of the details right would have been helpful as well. The book is VERY good yarn (thus the three stars), but it's also annoying in it's nationalism (let's call it chauvinism) and stereotypes that border on rascism. Warning: Members of the political left and citizens of non-NATO states might feel offended."
3,More is Not Better,"Having read all of Clancy's fictional books I must say that while each becomes larger they are not becoming better. More pages but no more story. It seems as if Clancy has attempted to incorporate ever character from each of his prior books, even when they are not needed. Was The Rainbow Six Team needed here or was that a veiled attempt to sell more of the Rainbox Six book and games?Too many sub-plots that wither on the vine. Better development of fewer sub-plots would have improved this novel. I agree with another reviewer, The Bear and the Dragon lacked an effective editor, clearly the spell checker in Clancy's computer is defective.Unfortunately, Clancy has risen to the level where most will buy his books without reading the reviews -- something I will not do in the future."
1,Bear & Dragon Cliffs Notes,China invades Russia. Russia joins NATO. NATO kicks China's [butt]. Clancy loves a strong military. Clancy hates career politicians. Clancy hates abortion. Clancy takes your money without delivering the quality of his first few books.
1,Over the top or over the hill?,"I received this tome for Christmas, and read it over two very rainy days. Clancy hasn't lost his ability to design a compelling plot, however the book leaves much to be desired.Like many authors who write formulaic bestsellers, over time Clancy has gotten caught up in his own grandiosity and therefore won't let the publisher edit his books. This one REALLY needed a strong editor. At 1100 pages, it was too long, with too many subplots, too many long soliloquies of Clancy's John Birchish political philosophy, and too many repetitious banal catch phrases uttered by characters.Clancy has been headed down this road for some time--really since putting Jack Ryan in the White House--and I had vowed to stop buying his egotrips, and getting this one as a gift has only reinforced this stance.This piece is hugely disappointing for one who's read Clancy since The Hunt for Red October. Clancy either needs to get back to his roots, or give it up."
2,old and tired,"Clancy has gotten boring!!! Just pages upon pages upon pages... Improbable plot, unbelievable characters. He has previously given us Japan attacking the USA, right. Get real, make it at least possible. And Jack Ryan was once a great character but did he have to become president? what is next, Ryan as Pope or just God?The book is way way to long and after the first 100 pages fatigue sets in. Skip to the end. Or better yet, just ask someone who has read it to give you a two minute overview."
1,Not Clancy's best,"I was very disappointed. Definitely not up to the caliber of Red October or Cardinal -- or even Rainbow. The plot development is weak. Actually I think Clancy has become such a popular writer that his editors might be hesitant to make suggestions. Personally, I think Bear and Dragon could have benefited from losing 300 or so pages. And what about that Gogol character? He's really interesting and Clancy passes up a great chance to develop him. Also Clancy's knowledge of China is a somewhat dated. Politburo members dress in suits, and their secretaries would probably dress to the nines, too..."
1,Isn't the Gore/Bush race enough politics for this year?,"Okay, I normally get through a good book in a week, with one this long, maybe 2-3 weeks, but it's been 5 weeks since I started this book & I'm only on page 191 (out of 1000+). This book reads more like a political statement than a novel (e.g., abortion, foreign affairs, the economy - & remember I'm not even 200 pages in yet). A suspense thriller is not the right place to get up on a soapbox Mr. Clancy. Your views, and your need to express them so strongly in your book, is making you predictable, sir. And being able to surmise the trend & tone (if not the events) of the rest of the story is the last thing I want from this type of book, especially with 800 pages left."
1,PURE DRIVEL,"This is by far & away the worst book Tom Clancy has written. I couldn't even finish reading it. After 300 pages, I gave up. I tried to get into the story but there's way too many sub-plots and political rants instilled by the author. He also should find a new editor, this book could have been more enthralling if you throw out 500 pages of it. I guess I should be thankful Clancy used POTUS instead of actually writing out the full title, ""President of the United States,"" otherwise this book might have been 1500 pages long."
2,I really tried to like this novel.,"I just couldn't. Maybe Clancy has tired of writing exciting novels. I certainly tired of reading The Bear and the Dragon. A friend recommended that I read this novel because of the recent diplomatic problems with China and the American spy plane. The book pales in comparison to the real drama.Jack Ryan has been a great character in the previous novels. In this one, his age shows badly. He's a character that has lost his shine. In the story, Ryan has reluctantly run for and been elected to the presidency. He doesn't really like his job. By the end, I wish he had just resigned. Clancy uses abortion in a very inflamatory way to paint the Chinese as horrible people. Clancy should have saved his opinions on this issue for a letter to the editor. Instead, he should have written a compelling story. Skip this one. If you're new to Clancy, read his earlier novels, like Red October. They're much, much better stories."
1,Very Sad Effort,"I have read all of Mr. Clancy's books and like others have become disappointed with the quality of writing not to mention the disjointed story line. How his editors allowed this novel to be published is beyond my comprehension. It seemed the same phrases were used time and time again to the detriment of the book. Finally I think its high time Mr. Clancy retired Jack Ryan. I have never, ever, been a fan of Ryan, reading the books more for the other characters Mr. Clancy created. If I have to read one more time about Ryan's character I will gag. Personally, every time the book reverted to the White House where Ryan was wrestling with some dilemma I breezed through the segment hoping to read something more interesting then Mr. Clancy moralizing to us through Jack Ryan's character. Do us all a favor Mr. Clancy, if you are unable to write to your previous high standards, just stop and run for office since it appears you think you have all the answers."
5,A Clancy fan tride and true,"If you have not followed the Ryan saga from square one dont bother reading the book. You just wont understand. Definately not his best book, but it is still better than 99.9% of the other books in this genre. Great plot, amazing accuracy, and a little predictable but still hard to put down."
4,Great Techno-thriller that Liberals Will Hate,"Clancy's novel has flaws of redundancy and excessive length, but it is an excellent thriller using the latest technology as a backdrop. Most remarkable, it expresses philosophies that ring true and are shared by many Americans -- that Liberals will find politically incorrect and try to censor. Consider that in reading the negative reviews, and read it for yourself instead of allowing their censorship to succeed."
3,Long but worth the read.,Some people who have reviewed this book need to lighten up. I enjoyed it inspite of the swearing and racial slurs. (Believe it or not people do talk like that).The book offers a lot of political and historical facts as allways. The first half of the book does build a little slowly but it gets very interesting in the latter half of the book.
4,Another gripping Clancy story,"After reading some other reviews I wonder if we read the same book. Clancy was true to form with this book. The plot had me hooked from the beginning. Clancy did a good job of illustrating the dangers and frustrations of governing and the benefits of a well funded military. His choice of China as the ""enemy"" in this book is rooted in the truth (probably more than people want to admit). I won't say this book is my favorite ever, but the only one's better were also written by Clancy."
2,Wonderful story with 'fizzled finale',"Like so many of his recent works, this starts with a great story premise and his unparalled attention to detail is there as always, but falls flat in the climax. Wars are not so perfectly conducted with no errors by the home team. The heroes, much as I'd like to know and be friends with them personally, lack the flaws of human nature that we all have to one degree or another. Rather than a crashing crescendo of a climax that builds to the final bar of music, this simply rolls down with the 'good guys' winning everything; an unlikely scenario for the large 'limited engagement' this is. I'll continue to read Clancy's Jack Ryan & Paul Hood series because I like their character and ethic, but hope Clancy does something to make the endings more realistic."
4,Very Good but not his best.,"I thought this was a really good book. I finished it within 5 days I was so engrossed in it. It is a little boring at parts but thats a norm in Clancy books because of all the detail and length in his books. The climax at the end was great and inpredictable. Debt of Honor or Without Remorse are better but Clany is getting old and running out of ideas. I would put this book around #6 or so out of the 10 or so Clany novels. Better: Debt of Honor, Executive Orders, Without Remorse, Sum of all Fears, Clear and Present Danger. Worse: Cardinal of the Cremlin, Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Red Storm Rising."
2,"C'mon, Tom, how about some characterization?...","If you have read any of Clancy's other books, you know he cannot do characters (or dialogue, and he has trouble with plot). Jack Ryan, Mrs. Dr. Ryan, the Secret Service, the National Security Advisor, Robby the Vice President, et al., are all thin, narrow, and often troubled people (Ryan hates his job, Dr. Ryan apparently has no rounds at the hospital, the Secret Service agent has morningsickness, etc.).So, does one expect better than that which has gone before? One would think that in 1,000 pages Clancy might be learning, but he is not. Too bad. Looks like I'm not learning, either, because I read all 1,000 pages, so who's the fool?"
1,"""Gag me with a spoon""","I got 200 pages into the book and could not go any farther. Even enduring a cross Atlantic flight with nothing to read was better then reading anymore. I have always found Clancy's books riveting but this one seemed to be nothing more then a venue for his political views. That wouldn't be so bad if there was believable characters or an interesting plot (Maybe it comes later, but I doubt it). It's time to kill of Jack Ryan he has become such a stereotype character he's not salvageable. My recommendation is save the money and read something interesting."
1,"An OK 500 page book. Unfortunately it's over a 1,000","Clancy eventually offers his usual tense, involving, techno-fare at the end of the book. To get there, however, Clancy forces the reader to wade through reams of tedious, repetitive, and shallow drivel. TC's command of the the technology of warfare stands in sharp contrast with his command of almost anything human. The Chinese are portrayed as unimaginative drudges led by Klingon-like Maoists whose only relaxation appears to be sexual abuse of the office help. When he isn't swearing like a sailor with his old military buddies, whining about how much he hates his job, or amateurishly plunging the world into nuclear war, Jack Ryan spends most of his time bumbing cigarettes and hoping his wife won't find out because she is a surgeon and might emasculate him. Apparently, no joke or shallow observation is too lame for repetition after repetition.TC needs stick with what he does best, because, if this book is any example, he can't do much else."
1,Paid by the word?,"With ""The Hunt for Red October"" I became a Tom Clancy fan. I agreed with all of the glowing reviews. And the next several books (and movies) also entertained me.However, after 50 pages of ""The Bear and The Tiger"" I concluded that Mr. Clancy must be getting paid by the word. After 183 pages I realized that he is trying to gain favor with the Catholic Church. His constant moralizing and preaching so clouds and distracts from the story line that one has trouble keeping one's place. He has Jack Ryan, who should personify competance, whining, and being bitter.If the book were edited to @250 to 300 pages it might be very enjoyable. Unfortunately it is 1028 pages of mostly preaching, moralizing, and patronizing text. Don't waste your time."
1,Where's Tom Clancy and Who's This Guy,"I've been a big fan of Tom Clancy ever since Hunt For Red October and I have to say that this is by far his worst book ever. The plot was so predictable I knew the end before I'd gotten halfway thru. The characters are beginning to resemble cardboard cutouts, without anything to make them human. Maybe Tom just needs to take a break, much like he had Jack Ryan do between Sum Of All Fears and Debt Of Honor. A couple of years to recharge his mental batteries and regain his edge."
1,Threw this one away,"This is probably the last Tom Clancy book I will buy. I have been a fan for over 10 years and have loved all his other books. But this one was very dissapointing. The character development is weak, there is very little action, the amount of boring scene descriptions is staggering, and the political soapbox is obvious. He has reduced Jack Ryan to a boring politician. I have been reading this book for over a week and have only gotten about a quarter of the way through. I doubt very seriously if I will even finish it. I never thought I would come across a Tom Clancy book that I couldn't care less about reading. I think he has lost his touch."
2,"Awful, Awful, Awful!","I have loved Tom Clancy and all his books since very early in his career but this book is terrible. As if we didn't know it from the last book, Jack Ryan hates being President. In case you didn't get it the last time, Ryan tells you about 200 times again in this book. We all know that Tom likes describing military equipment and proceeds to do so with mind-numbing detail. In the first 500 pages only two events happen, the rest is pretty much as I have already stated. This might have been a decent book by taking out about 600 - 700 pages of filler, i.e., Ryan hates his job, military equipment descriptions, Clancy's discourse of countries he either likes or hates, etc. Tom we know you are an ultra-conservative right-wing just slightly to the left of fascism but do we have to drone on forever just to fill in a book? Are you being paid by the word?"
1,The worst Jack Ryan book,"I used to enjoy Clancy books for its engaging plot and ability to make you wonder if something like that could really happen. This new book is nothing but trash and while most of his writing has been fiction, it would appear that Clancy has delved into the realms of fantasy. While he has always stereotyped to a pointdifferent race and nations, this book is basically a list of his perceived problems that people who are not red blooded American have. His racism is evident and his story is lacking. While I the basic plot of China invading Russia for resources follows from his earlier book and could have been a very interesting story, it appears Clancy just didn't try. I use to really enjoy his books, but this will probably be the last one I buy."
3,Hard to get into the first half,I have also read all of his books but it took what seemed like days to get through the first half. Once it heated up it was very good. Think it should have been 500 pages even though I LOVE long books. But they have to hold my interest. Really do enjoy all the old characters coming into play again. I will continue to read Mr. Clancy's books.
2,Mediocre work despite an interesting premise,"Clancy appears to have decided not to put a great deal of effort into his latest work, borrowing liberally from one of his first efforts, _Red Storm Rising_. Unfortunately, this book doesn't quite match up to that earlier work. This is a long book, not just in the number of pages, but in the feel. Unlike most of his past efforts, it's in no way a page turner, but instead you read on simply to get to the end. And when you get there, be prepared for disappointment. After setting up an interesting premise, Clancy wraps everything up more neatly than most Christmas presents. The only plus to the work is the characters long time Clancy readers have grown to know so well--they remain generally the same, and are fun to follow, but their talents could be much better used. Perhaps it's time for Clancy to start a new series, as he appears to be tired of dreaming up new problems for Jack Ryan."
2,Too Long? Too Short?,"The book takes an inordinate amount of time to build to the climax, then it is as if Clancy realized he had used 990 pages and had to end the book in the last 30.When you sit through the first part of the book, you expect the story to be completed.Mr Clancy should realize that ""The Hunt for Red October"", easily his best, ran only 387 pages in the hardcover edition."
2,tedious and unfocused,"Tom Clancy has always delivered a great plot, but with The Bear and the Dragon, the plot can be told in about 50 pages of the 1028. Characters, who continue to enter the novel even on page 800, are too many; the plot is tediously expanded with overdone details of military equipment. The plot becomes hard to follow and takes concentration when reading - when all one wants is a good, fun plot as Clancy has delivered in the past. And the overuse of the ""f"" word gets old."
2,TOO MANY PAGES - TOO LITTLE WAR,"Tom Clancy is in dire need of a Book Editor. This novel reads like an Unedited first draft - needlessly overlong, overwritten, with too few incidents occuring and a sluggish plot that never rises to the occasion (not even in the end). It's simply not worth 1,028 pages - and your time. It could easily lose 400 or so. It seems Clancy did a lot of research and dang! if he isn't going to include each & every thing he learned. Back off, Tom! I loved his previous novels - but with this one, he shows that he's rapidly losing sight of simple, good story-telling. This is not a worthy successor to his previous novels. It's slow, excessively wordy, and too thin."
3,Maybe reality isn't so far away,"The Bear and the Dragon IS a long book. Although I like the ""techno"" details, it does tend to bog down the story.I used to think that flying a plane into a building was fantasy...in Clancy's world maybe...not anymore. Economics bringing down a giant...in Clancy's world...not so unreal now, is it? China is facing a huge problem. The chemical additives in toothpaste and lead in our children's toys are making it through the Chinese factory quality controls. Remember the term, ""real money impacts."" Is it going to push us into a nuclear war with China? Probably not, but Clancy's novels have a way of meeting reality on several layers.So, don't be so critical and enjoy the novel for what it is: a story told from the author's viewpoint, which no one has to agree with. It takes awhile to figure out how everything connects, but it leads towards an exciting conclusion. The ending was very satisfying."
2,Profanity Detracts,"I was a Clancy fan up until this book. There is too much profanity, repeated and unnecessary. Sometimes a point can be made by it, but its excessive use caused me to begin just skimming the book after 300 pages.A good page-length for this book would have been 450, not 1000+."
2,Boring....Boring....Boring....,The first 800 pages are pure drudgery. Not one exciting moment. Just trivial dribble and pointless dialogue. I've read every Clancey book but this book is horrible. When the action does finally start it has to be rushed to a quick conclusion because 900 pages have already been written. The battlefield scenes are shallow and undetailed. Don't waste your time on this one.
3,"Worst of the lot, but still better than others work","I have just finished this book and suffice it to say, I am somewhat disappointed. Maybe the Jack Ryan story line is wearing thin, but this is the first book from Clancy which disappointed me. The ending seemed rushed.. (did anyone else get the feeling that at one time, the nuke actually took out D.C. with Ryan, only to have TC change his mind into the book?)What disappointed me the most was the overly excessive use of profanity. It added absolutely NOTHING to the book. I got the feeling that he was being payed for every ""F"" word and vulgar human anatomy term that he used...."
2,"Rainbow Six Wasn't the Detour, It Was the New Direction","With this effort, Tom Clancy has dropped from my ""automatic hardback purchase"" list; the sneering, soulless _Rainbow Six_ has given way to the appalling excesses of _The Bear and the Dragon_. The primary plot line, as usual, is aggressive and intriguing, but the villains' brains in Clancyland have apparently not paid their oxygen bill for a couple of books now. Even worse, one of the subplots -- the one which closes the book down -- is leeringly written and utterly offensive. There's a decent story in here somewhere, but only an editor with a red (pen) army could have salvaged this book's feng shui."
1,Piece of Trash,"Boring, long drawn out sleepy book. Thank goodnes I can speed read. I feel sorry for those of you that have to suffer through the tedium of this thing. From racial slurs to swearing that just doesn't fit the situation. The only highlight was the new pig bomb; and the other pig, Ming. Japenese sausage? How freaking juvenille. This book smells of a ghostwriter, or Clancy is out of original thought and is done."
2,Disapointed ....,"I would always look forward to the Clancy books but sadly, this is no longer true. Completely disjointed, shallow, simple plot with no real satisfying ending. Barely worth reading for die hard fans, but wait for paperback."
3,Another rant...,"Another overwritten book of overdeveloped characters through which Clancy lectures the audience on his own political beliefs. Clancy's distaste for government, liberals, the media, politicians, anyone who doesn't subscribe to Clancy's belief system, etc., permeates his writing, interfering with Clancy's obvious mastery of the technical art of war (i.e., the real reason people buy his books). The quality of Clancy's writing, brought to such a fever pitch with his first five or six books, has steadily declined over the past three efforts."
1,Clancy and right to life?,"I have read and enjoyed all of Clancy's books, own the movies and rushed to buy this one. Now I am rushing to return it to Costco.Page 181 and Mr. Clancy decides that the right to lifers deserve a forum. There were references to the Chiense and killing new borns early in the book, but when Jack Ryan descides the Supreme Court should reverse Roe vs. Wade I had enough.Mr. Clancy has done what my wife and children have tried to do for 30 years, make me a democrat. Monday I sending a $100 to AL Gore."
2,Non-suspenseful and laborious,"This may be the last book of Clancy's that I read. Normally, I read one of his books straight through. Took me over a week, and I had to work at getting interested. Ryan has become self righteous & goody two shoes. Over and over Ryan character tells us how he hates being President, but someone got to do it. He doesn't want to get use to people waiting on him, he just wants to be a regular guy. And he owes it to the American people to take the job. And I agree with the reviewer that was turned off by Pat & Ed and their honey bunny. PLEASE!! The end was an exercise in reading page after page of military gizmos."
2,"I think Tom is bored, and would quit except it pays so well","I am a Clancy fan and have read all of his single author work.The book dragged. It took a long time to get going and then it didn't last long. Mr. Clancy is famous for the techno thriller genre. In this one he forgot the thriller and the techno.His hero Jack Ryan, shows up to be a chain smoking, alcoholic, sexist, preacher for a watered down Roman Catholism. He is willing to comitt suicide, rather than be thought a coward. The villians are all shallow dirty old men. Two of his best characters are both gunned down early in the plot.There a long poorly done uneeded seduction scene. There is an account of diplomacy which if accurate would seem to indicate that all diplomats die of boredom.The story is pedicatable and not very interesting.Please Tom, we know you can do better."
2,Too long!,As Mr. Clancy ages he seems to ramble...This book could have been much better with fewer words.
4,The Bear and the Dragon,"Hey, it's typical Tom Clancy! He has always been wordy & technical. He's just not talking military equipment this time. He's telling us to take note of who are future enemies may be. Even if he took out all of the ""duly noted"" and ""honey-bunnies"" It still going to be a long book... If your going to pay $18. for a book, don't you want to read it for more than one day? Talk about wordy books.... Read ""Grapes of Wrath"". We loved it, too. We feel this book is a continuation of the people we've know & enjoyed through the years. For those who love Tom Clancy... read some Clive Cussler... Keep up the good work, Tom."
2,enough is enough,i had to express my opinion on this one .to me it seems that clancy writes to get the approval of those who make his life easier.this bs with clark and chavez is a joke . im sorry but the conservative ideals he champions just make you pray that clancy's political ambitions match his pro sports acheivements thanks jhg
2,MUCH TO LONG,I have been a Clancy fan from the beginning. But I thought this book could have been compressed to about 500 pages and nothing would have been lost.Very repetitive. I hope he hasn't burned out from the good old days.
3,The Unbearable Entertainment of Arrogance,"This one is usually fun, but it's just as often infuriating. Thinly-veiled cryptofascist politics, recycled dialogue, cliched characters and over the top emotional chain-yanking detract from what is otherwise a pretty snappy technothriller plot. As we've come to expect from Mr. Clancy, he's a name-dropper, especially in his attempts to convince us he's an expert on modern weaponry and intelligence gadgetry. Too often, he's wrong, though, such as when he misidentifies the main gun caliber of Russian T-80/90 tanks (and even when he screws up football rivalries in the Southeastern Conference, the cad!).Nevertheless, it's worth your time, if you don't mind waiting until around page 388 or so for things to really start hopping. Larry Bond, where are you when we need you?"
2,A let down from a talented writer,"I have been a TC fan since ""Red October"" (read when I was still in the Navy), and that's why I'm so bothered by this book. I won't argue the political leanings, but I was offended by some of the language in the book. The cracks TC had Ryan make about his secret service agent (when she's discovered to be pregnant) were fairly far out of bounds, but the most offensive of all was the final sentence in the book. It was just plain vulgar, and to no good point.And, as much as I hate to say it, I think it's time to retire Jack Ryan as a character - he's simply no longer interesting to me. He's become predictable and inflexible, and just not that much fun to read about.This is a shame, because the overall theme of the story had all kinds of great potential (and, admittedly, some was followed through on), but so little was done with it. What a pity."
4,Groovy Pop-Punk,"This CD is great. I myself am in love with pop-punk and I can't get enough of this infectious ear candy. As one reviwer said, these guys sound a lot like Zoinks!. But thats a good thing cuz Zoinks! is the frickin greatest band in the universe! This CD is a must buy, along with Zoinks! and Sicko."
2,Don't bother,"This guy has a nasal kid voice that sounded better in Zoinks! I guess he is trying to ""grow as an artist"" but the songs are boring and repetative. The guys in the band are totally old, too, and it looks like these stupid old guys trying to rock out. Check out Alkaline Trio instead."
1,Old Style Basics,"If you have a big imagination, you might be able to build an entertainment center with style from this book. All of the plans a basically the same with a few changes to give it a different look. You could say it was not what I was really looking for. I have a widescreen TV that would by no means fit in any of these designs, nor do I even like the ""look"" of these designs. Too many changes had to be made to give it an up to date size/look."
1,Many errors and missing steps make for very poor plans,"I bought this book with the hope that by using somebody elses plans (rather than drawing my own) I would not have to worry about calculating all the dimensions and designing as I go along. Unfortunately, this book has so many errors and ommissions in the plans that you cannot trust any dimension he gives. Parts and steps that are necessary to complete a unit are missing. Don't waste your money on this book. They obviously didn't waste time proofreading it..."
2,Of limited use,"The description tells of different styles (Shaker, Mission, Country and Contemporary) - this is relatively untrue. They have taken a basic design and reworked it to have a few different designs. This book is good for non-woodworkers who do not want to spend the cash on an entertainment center (actually this is partially true, since you will need a router, a table saw, a band saw, a drill press and clamps... so you might as well buy the entertainment center!)It has an okay section on making cabinet doors and building drawers.I guess my major gripe about this book is that I really don't like the basic design, and all other designs are rehashes of this one. I have build my entertainment center without using this book."
3,Worked great for about 6 months,Received this item for Christmas. After about 6 months of use it would intermittently power itself down. Now it won't power up at all. Guess it's time to look for another one.
1,Effectively Not Red Elvises,"Quite simply, this is not really a Red Elvises album. It was an album written entirely by Zhenya Kolykhanv, who left the band shortly after to pursue other projects - and you can see why. The Red Elvises has always been about fun live rock and roll, and this is a mellow pop album.Now that's not to say that this is bad music. But those who keep spamming the review form about how great this music is, and how horrible it is that the Elvises don't play it live, should check out Zhenyas new band Zeerok, and leave the Elvises to do what they do best."
3,I've Heard Better,"I love the Red Elvises, have loved them for about seven years now. I've heard and own all thier albums and intend on buying the newest one whenever it gets released.However, I must say that Bedroom Boogie and Welcome to the Freakshow are not thier best albums. Really, Grooving to the Moscow Beat, Surfing in Siberia, I Wanna See You Bellydance are their best stuff. Better than Sex is okay, and Shake Your Pelvis is decent. It all begins to go up at Lunatics and Poets; personally, I think thier best album since Bellydance.If you want to hear good Red Elvises, check out those other albums and if you really begin to like them, check these ones out too, because it's as someone else said, a little mellower than thier other stuff."
1,"Zhenya bad, Igor good...","The problem with this CD isn't that the band's style has left them, but rather that Zhenya has written all of the songs. Don't get me wrong, I love him as a member of the band, but he just has a pop style that doesn't fit the Red Elvises at all. Existing fans must not be put off! They released two albums simultaneously this time, one by Zhenya and one by Igor. All of the songs on Igor's new album, Welcome to the Freakshow, shine with classic Red Elvises style. Look into it instead, because I'd give it a 5!"
1,Change for the worse,"Now, I'm all for a band to change its style and take some risks. I love that. But with the Red Elvises, when you listen to them, you expect to hear a certain sound. This album finds the band going towards a more ""grungy"" bar-rock style and puts its emphasis on the lyrics. LYRICS. Ever hear a Russian try to sing about a hot-dog stand girl? Not pretty. And when they sing about a fun night on the town consisting of doing cocaine in the limo, it makes you wonder what the heck they were thinking. I bought the album hoping to smile and laugh, but instead, this one is destined for the trash heap."
5,Foot stomping fun,"Slade were the archetypical Glam Rock group with their huge platform shoes, glitter and 'over the top' dress style. Sure they were older than most of the bands of the time but somehow that didn't seem to matter. They certainly had the energy and sheer sense of fun that any younger band would have envied. This album features there greatest hits, of which there were many. From the loud and lively tracks such as Cum on Feel the Noize and 'Get Down and Get With it' to the more gentle 'Everyday' and 'How Does it Feel' there is something to suit every taste. Great fun."
3,Average...you can get more info elsewhere.,"Mr. Shemin offers a few good ideas, but this book lacks the detail of other texts on the subject. Instead, I would recommend the following alternatives:""Landlording: A Handy Manual for Scrupulous Landlords and Landladies Who Do It Themselves"" (9th Ed), by Leigh Robinson.""Every Landlord's Legal Guide (Book & CD-ROM)"" by Marcia Stewart, Janet Portman, Ralph E. Warner""The Landlord's Troubleshooter"" by Robert Irwin..."
2,A landlord book that's not based on today's reality.,"Although Shemin brings up many good ideas, I found that most of his ideas are way to cheezy for me (or Southern california.) He discusses buying places for $8,000-$20,000 (I wish) and believes that charging more for rent will ultimately get you higher quality tenents. I completely disagree, especially in down markets.A decent book, overall, but I'd suggest a Nolo book which has more real legal information as well as solid do's and don'ts for a landlord."
2,Common Sense,"Not very impressed with the book, if I would of just gain one thing from this book it would of been worth it. But nope!"
2,Not impressed at all,I'm not even done reading the book and i dont want to finished it. It just to basic the first few pages are good but after that its all down hill.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I was appalled at some of the information in this book! It should be titled ""How to Exploit the Poor for Maximum Profitability"". He specifically targets low to moderate income neighborhoods, and then offers a variety of ways to nickel and dime the tenants. He basically states that they expect less, so he gives them less. If they want what would be minimal accoutrements, he charges them for these basic amenities. Then he touts rewarding tenants who comply with his ""principals"" modest gifts-through his ""incentive programs"". I think these gifts are to soothe his conscious. Don't be taken in. Some of these ""Secrets"" should have stayed a secret-he should be ashamed to admit his practices, let alone encourage others to do the same."
3,"Decent, but not outstanding","For a book which carries a $29 list price, it was lacking in the depth of art it covered. As mentioned in the other review, the artwork was from the Warhammer Collectable Card Game (CCG) by Sabertooth games. There is nothing wrong with the art, but I would liked to have seen more work from Games Workshops own artists who done many excellent pieces. The text was really the high point for me. The background of the Horus Heresy was interesting and gave me some added understanding of the 40K universe. In short, a decent book but not a great one. Probably not worth buying at the list price."
2,A glorified commercial for the card game,"2.5 stars really, on the strength of the art, but still, for such an important conflict in the 40k universe I thought this was an incredibly weak offering from the Black Library.I'd like to see them collect the three Horus Heresy volumes into one edition and strike out the irrelevent references to the game, but I'm not holding my breath there.I can't recommend the Horus Heresy volumes unless you're a die hard 40k fan. For something worth your time *and* money, check out the Liber Chaotica instead!"
2,"Disappointing, but a good read...","This book is merely a collection of artwork used in an upcoming CCG that Games Workshop is releasing. With the vast amount of artwork that GW has created on this subject over the last 15 years, I was hoping for a real in-depth visual history of the heresy. That is not what this is. It does contain work from John Blanche(of course), Adrian Smith, and many others. But there is no older artwork to speak of, just work related to the CCG. Not to say this book is a complete waste, the text is quite good. It is exhaustive in it's discussion of all aspects of the subject, but this is an art book, and in this regard I think it really lacks."
2,Size not quite right,The length and waist are a little shorter/smaller than the same size pants from other manufacturers.
1,Dockers flat-front original khaki pants,"Dockers? Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit(tm) WaistbandOrdered thru Macys for husband as work slacks. Pants rec'd were not made of the same soft cotton fabric as ones we had bought in stores previously. Scratchy, stiff and seem to attract lint and hair. One pair had been re-hemmed (very poorly). Very disappointed but had to keep and use because he needed for his job."
5,Very Good.,"The slacks arrived very quickly. They are a brand new, high-quality product in great shape."
1,Too small for stated size,"I ordered three different styles of Docker's pants, all in size 34x32 (the other being Dockers Men's Pleated Original Khaki and Dockers Men's Pleated Never Iron Cotton Khaki). The other two fit fine (and I regularlywear 34x32 pants), whereas this one is distinctly smaller both in waist size and inseam. Worse, since ""too small"" is viewed by Amazon as a customer error even though the problem clearly lies in the product itself,they want me to pay for the return shipping!"
1,Tired of small versions of stated sizes,"I have had it with all the overseas made slacks running small that I have ordered on Amazon. This is my third order of slacks. When I bought Dockers a couple years ago, they were Stain Defenders size 36x32 and they still fit me perfectly. This is the third order of of various types of slacks I ordered this year size 36x32 that have not fit properly. These are far smaller than 36x32. If you order a size larger they might fit you, but I don't think it proper that the sizes are off like this in the first place. The three pair I received from Flat-front Classic Fit Original Khaki with Individual Fit(tm) Waistband order were made in the Dominican Republic. One other thing. I just got in some slacks from JC Penney size 36x32 and they fit just fine."
4,Dockers pants for the win,"I won't give them 5 stars because they're not really as wrinkle-free as they advertised or as my similar Van Heusen khakis. Either way, they are still light and trés comfortable."
2,"""No wrinkle, permanent crease"" NOT","This is a solid well-made casual pair of pants. But from the first few daysof wear and from the first careful wash wrinkles were everywhere. Maybethe exact phrase ""wrinke-free"" as in some Van Heusen shirts is a moreaccurate phrase to look for when trying to find clothing that wrinkles less.Also it is advertised as ""stretch"" but does not and thelabel says ""2% spandex."""
4,Classic,"These pants are wonderful, I have boxy hips and the flat front style takes away from that particular silhouette a and I like that"
3,The Title is Misleading,"This DVD is more aerobics with light weights. It you want to concentrate on and define a muscle, this isn't the DVD for you. I recommend Kathy Smith's Time Saver series...."
4,Oldie but really good,"This was clearly made a very long time ago. Anyone who's a fan of Karen can tell she's quite young as are the two guys working out in this one that are much older in the newer stuff. That aside, the workout is killer! Karen it is a tough cookie! I used 5lb weights and nearly blasted my shoulders and arms off!!! It looks like they're only using like 3lb weights, which is what I suggest. At 5lbs I couldn't do all the reps and I'm an advanced exerciser. There's sections for upper and lower body that can be split on separate days."
4,Karen Voight Great Weighted,This is a very good DVD. Karen makes you work hard.I also like the fact that she is so fit and sculpted. I would highly recommend this video if you are looking for an exceptional workout.
4,Hardy Citrus,"This a great reference to help those interested in cold hardy citrus. The author describes many citrus hybrids such as: Yuzuquat, Marmaladequat, O.P. Nagami, SanCitChang, Republic of Texas orange, etc. There are not many publications available at this time for cold hardy citrus enthusiasts so this booklet comes in very handy."
5,great product / great service,"the shure microphone arrived way before the deadline in a secure package. the microphone makes me sound better than I actually am, and that says a lot"
2,Not up to the standard of his earlier books,"Loved his earlier books in the Congo, Amazon etc... In fact I can still remember the best jokes 8 years later. In this one though his style has changed, less off-hand wit and more manic stream of consciousness. There's still plenty of fascinating info on the deep ocean fauna though."
2,Frenetic!,"Although I enjoy the stories in this book, and am interested in the subject matter, I find the book almost impossible to read. Every sentence ends in an exclamation point-it is so manic! manic! manic! I haven't been able to finish it-I can only take it in small doses because while I read it it seems as though everyone is screaming and breathless (which, who knows, they may have been-after all it was on a ship in a storm). Just a little hard to read, but very interesting."
2,Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic,"Redmond O'Hanlon lost me on this one. There are a handful of fine vignettes of daily life and duty aboard the ship in ""Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic."" But those few succulent morsels are seriously outdone by a ponderous, rambling narrative, dashed off late at night which he never revisits to polish up, which simply, tires you out.I was disappointed because as an armchair adventurer, this could have been the type of tale I relish. But O'Hanlon's writing here is sloppy and loose, unstructured with lots of tangents that lead to dead-ends. It was too heavy to shake off.I can't recommend this book as a book of its type. There are many other seafaring adventure tales that ""tell the tale well."" You might glance through this book and find the few juicy morsels but that's it."
2,Made me seasick,"This book has an interesting premise, adventure journey in the depths of winter into the harshest gales with the most foolhardy of fishermen on the North Seas. It's not an easy read, the narrative is disjointed and erratic. It's difficult to comprehend the purpose of most of the author's rambling passages other than to give you that woozy sense of nausea. At that, it succeeded. Like some of the other readers, the most pleasure I had from this book was realizing that I did not have to finish it."
2,Bad case of sleep-deprived testosterone poisoning,"I usually like O'Hanlon's books...I usually can't put them down. But this one...well, I'm just not sure I like it at all. Written in what O'Hanlon, I'm sure, thinks is a style akin to the sleep-deprived ramblings he must have encountered on the trawler, the book instead veers into incoherence and becomes only annoying. Revelations only work if you feel some sympathy and identification with the speaker and I found the speakers, with one exception, highly uninteresting and unsympathetic. Only big Bryan held my interest and I wanted to hear more from him.I found myself heartily sick of Luke, the walk-on-water marine biologist...he was like an orchestra work comprised of one note, played over and over and over. Jason the skipper...same thing. O'Hanlon invests them with a false nobility that just grates on the nerves after awhile.I can't recommend this book, but I heartily recommend O'Hanlon's other works."
3,An inside look at trawler life. Yep.,"O'Hanlon has done as good a job as any with the given material. The book premise - go out fishin' on a trawler for a few weeks in the North Atlantic in the middle of winter. By the end of the book you certainly have a sense of it - arduous, stinking, sleep deprived, and relentless. He tries to portray his shipmates, mostly louts, as interesing and half succeeds. He attempts to make the specifics of trawling interesting but how could you? The book sinks under O'Hanlons rambling conversations with his mentor Luke most of which are not even vaguely interesting. O'Hanlon himself becomes an embarrassing burden to the crew as they grind toward their quota. It is in this burden that the theme solidifies - 'trawler life sucks'."
2,I jumped ship,"I went fifty pages. I'm very interested in maritime lore and sea stories, but this was rough going. The narrator's friend Luke is made to spew lots of didactic talk about things the author is too lazy to show us. His emotions are conveyed through the constant use of italics, and he begins every sentence with the author's first name.Potentially very interesting, and apparently enjoyable to some, I thought this was a mess."
2,parentheses overload,"I found this book to be unreadable. If most people are like me and hear a little voice in their head as they are reading, the parentheses the author uses in practically every paragraph means a constant interruption of the flow of the idea and presentation. O'Hanlon seems to believe (or maybe assumes) that we are interested (and need to know) in what the heck (hell?) he is thinking (doing, looking, analyzing) every minute as he sails (vacations perhaps?)across the Atlantic. He should just tell me what he wants me to experience; there is no need to suggest alternative thoughts."
2,Very Disappointing,"Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love travel/adventure books, especially books at sea. So I was really looking forward to this book. I have never read a book more disappointing. The writing is almost impossible to follow. The setting (North Sea during Winter with tremendous storms) should have been spellbounding. Instead most of the book involves long discourses between crewmembers as if no one is listening to the other person. I believe only once does the author go above board and then only for a brief spell during a storm. This book is not worth reading."
4,Need for Speed High Stakes RULES!!,"Need for Speed High Stakes is a great game. It includes Hot Persuit, which lets you be the cop, or get chased by one, with cars like Diablos, Corvettes, and other really fast Hot Rods. You can also race with stunning tracks and win money to buy cars in Career mode. You can also look at the inside of the cockpit of any car you buy with amazing detail. I suggest that you buy it."
5,Excellent product!,My husband is from Norway and misses his scandinavian black licorice. These fit that bill plus they are organic. Can't beat that!
2,collection of three short stories,"entertaining read, with the usual Edson's way of interweaving historical events of the American western time. I was a bit disappointed that the paperback was actually three short stories."
5,Great Series,"I have been in love with The Black Stallion since I was a little kid. I watched this show as a child when it aired on the Family Channel back in the 90s and loved it then. I was so excited when the first season came out on DVD and I received it for Christmas. I'm an adult now, and I still love the series. I can hardly wait for the rest of it to come out on DVD."
5,Thank you!,My son was excited to receive this set for a gift! He had been wanting it for awhile when he saw my daughter's.
1,"Horrible, horrible adaptation","I read all the black stallion books over and over growing up. I liked the movies okay. But this series is a travesty! I've watched six eps of the first series and have yet to see a race (and it's not as if it starts where the book did). They talk about racing; they seem to be on the fair circuit, which is a huge problem for me. The acting is horrible. They yell at each other all the time. Alec is unbelievable. Mickey Rooney makes William Shatner's Denny Crane look restrained. Every plot is like an after school special. This is not the black stallion and Alec Ramsey I grew up with and I'm not going to bother to finish this series because I'm so disappointed. Buyer beware."
2,15 minutes of info in >2hrs.,"I bought this video to help retrain my bass drum technique. I for one was very disappointed with the limited scope and how much excruciating detail is put into obvious and natural motions. The video doesn't go into any detail on more advanced applications such as repeated bass drum triplets, 32nd notes, or even touch on double bass drumming.The instructor talks WAY too much in a very monotone delivery. For every section, I've had to fast forward just to get to actual playing. I honestly believe I could get the same info from a shorter presentation on Youtube.At the same time, I purchased Jojo Mayer's ""Secret Weapons"" to develop hand technique. Jojo's video is superb and in comparison highlights what little info is in this DVD (but in excruciating detail)."
3,Not as bad as everyone says,"I decided to purchase this DVD, in spite of the bad reviews. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. In spite of some bad editing, I truly enjoyed the performances, especially the bluegrass ones and the radio station appearances.I am a brand new Steve Earle fan, and I found I did learn quite a bit about the man behind the songs. It would have been great to have some more in depth interviews, and also to find out a bit more about Steve's early years, but hopefully, in the future, another documentary will be made. I am glad I didn't listen to the bad reviews, and picked this one up. It certainly was a lot better than I expected!"
2,Scary,"I find it very scary that William S. Burroughs lived his life in the grip of these heroine-induced hallucinations, and that people walk around everday seeing the things that are documented in this book. Some of the parts of the book were very funny, some were stomach-turning, and most were unintelligable."
3,It's not just you...,"Don't worry if you feel like your watching a foreign film in a language you don't speak, with a hidden plot. However, I don't think the plot is the essential element to this work: it is the characters. Even if you don't have a clue to what's going on, sit back and enjoy the variety of rich, complex characters that Naked Lunch has to offer."
2,Not certain of its value toward mankind.,After reading the introduction I assumed (stupidly) that this book would be a worthwhile endeavor. After reading the majority of it (it is required for a course in literature) I felt as if it were useless trash. I understand the ravings of a junky could be wild and yet I find no value in this book. I dare not consider it literature and I am uncertain as to whether it should be considered fiction. Did this happen? To whom? My professor claims it to be satiracle and yet this is not to be remembered (much) by the author. I suppose that it has left me confused and astounded. Perhaps I am more of a prude than I would have imagined
4,What can you say?,"I was hesitant to give this book a starred review. Can I accurately say that I liked it? Well, yes, I can admire its inventiveness and originality, Burroughs' unwillingness (although surely not intentional, since the book was written in a drug haze) to bow to convention and ""decency"", and the sheer audacity of some of it. But also, the book disturbed me. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. I also have to frown on the way wannabe beatniks and artsy-types have latched on to this book. It is a book. It is not the best book ever written, it is certainly not the worst, and it may not even be the most daring book ever. I appreciated it, and chances are that somewhere along the line I will read it again (if only to remind myself why I now shudder when I hear anything by or relating to the rock group ""Steely Dan""). It's hard to say anything about this book. It really is."
4,The Depths of Insanity,I have read this book three times and every time I feel something twisting and breaking inside of my head. Like I'm losing part of my sanity with each passing sentence. It is one complex yet enjoyable read. It's disturbing and beautiful. If you've only seen the movie then you owe it to yourself to read the book. Because the book is incredible. You'll get a lot more out of it. Though the Cronenberg film is one of my favorites.
2,an interesting book but a heacache to read,"i had a permanent wrinkle in my forehead while reading this book. The language was cut and stiff at times, and at others very vague. I found myself reading and re-reading each sentence in some hope to understand the meaning behind the jumble of words."
4,HOLY...SHI...TOTALY UNLIKE ANYTHING IVE EVER READ.,"...OR WILL EVER READ. With that said, it goes with out and introduction about how...out there (?) Naked Lunch is. Its a great novel, psychotic, but still a damn good novel. I saw the movie first and loved it, then once my sister lent me her copy and finished it a within a week. OMG is the only way that I can describe this novel as. If you are going to read this book I highly recommend reading interzone by William s Burroughs. Its a sorta explanation for the book; a introduction if I may. After reading this book, you may once see, as I had, why it was banned, topics of book burnings and trialed for obscenity.....a definate classic"
1,Huh?,"I am about halfway through this ""book"" of 200+ pages of incomprehensible gibberish, and I haven't yet decided whether to keep on slogging through it or give up. It makes anything Bret Easton Ellis writes look like Pulitzer prize material by comparison. But I'm sure the pseudo-intellects out there who lavish praise on this pile of literary garbage (even if they haven't read it) would say that I'm a philistine who just doesn't get it. Maybe I should start shooting heroin. Would I get it then?"
4,I feel queasy,"This book is frustrating for me. I have a love/hate affair with it at the moment, as I have just finished it for the first time. The language is beautiful but overwhelmingly confusing. Novels usually follow a linear pattern of thought, but this is an incredible web of aberration. I found it difficult, almost to the point of being senseless, to read the book cover-to-cover. I had such a hard time grasping what went on the entire time I was reading that I had to finish the book out of sheer obstinance. That all said, I still love this book and am excited to read it over again and again (but not too soon...)"
3,The Unreviewable Book,"I've been waiting to write my review of this book for six months now and I'm still not sure what I should write.As a fan of Hunter S. Thomson I'm used to spaced-out writing by drug addicts, but this one takes the cake.I enjoyed the unique prose style that Borroughs employs in this novel and I often found myself laughing out loud. The problem was that I often had to re-read a section several times before I could laugh.I hope I'm making you curious enough that you will read this book because I don't think that anyone can describe it and make any real sense. So here's what we're going to do. You're going to buy this book and read it and in six more months I'm going to come back here and edit this review. You can then read my review and we'll both see if we're making any sense at all."
5,i'm reading it for the 10th time,I couldnt be happier that my best friend put this book into my hands. It opend my eyes to a world that i was unaware of. I'm looking forward to reeding more of Burroughs books!
5,Insane,"If you're into books that make you think, then read this. Reading and eventually finishing Naked Lunch was like driving on a never-ending road - with your eyes closed. Brilliant is an understatement. Strange is a huge understatement - but - interesting and enlightening seem to describe this book quite nicely. William truly is a genius of the 20th century."
1,"""That's not writing--that's typing""-Truman Capote to Kerouac","Too bad you can't give a book ""zero stars."" This is the worst book ever. Burroughs attempts to offer up the complexity of a ""Ulysses"" or ""Finnegan's Wake"" with none of the talent or intellect. Unfortuanately, drugs don't make you deep, they make you incoherent. Absolute, chemically induced nonsense, like listening to someone slam on a piano keyboard for twelve hours and then tell you that it's not that they can't play, they're just interested in slamming on the keys. The big mystery is how this nonsense got published, but, after reading some of the reviews, I see that there are some people who seem to ""get it"". ""Wow, man, dig it, it's like, so surreal..."""
2,Not for your morning commute,"I had a bit of a problem with Naked Lunch because there is only so much monster on young boy gay sex I can read about on the train each morning before work. I don't know - this book definitely has its moments - Burroughs was obviously is brilliant man with a fantastic way with words, but the ""non-linear"" way Naked Lunch is written is just not for me. I have seen very intelligent people rave about this book, but I just can't get into it. I do think it influenced Layne Staley of Alice in Chains though, so all you Dirt fans might want to check it out. But yeah, this is a weird book to read in public because you keep thinking the person next to you is going to peer over your shoulder and see what you're reading - I had the same experience with American Psycho (an excellent book)."
1,....,"Don't even waste your time with this book, much like I am now in the process of writing this review.Use it as kindling."
2,stand-up for pseudo intellectuals,"Not really a work of literature, but a glorified transcript of pseudo intellectual stand-up comedy. The material is much more successful when delivered by the author on a spoken word CD."
1,"glorified crap, hyped up rubbish","If any smart ass junkie wrote a book during a drug high, they might as well do this very same thing this author did and get recognition for it.Plotless, pointless, characters not worth loving or hating, bulked up with vulgar themes and swear words, and occasionally interjected with random points of social relevance to make it seem profound maybe, has these so-called ""gems"" in it that can be read with more decency and clarity in a 6th grade essay, Naked Lunch is a whole bunch of rubbish and a waste of time.In addition to Jackass and the Blair Witch Project, Naked Lunch makes for a great addition to the junk pile of glorified crap out there though."
1,one word summary: bad,"It's good to see some non-""10"" reviews present. I gave this book a ""2,"" rather than the ""1"" that I gave Ginsberg's ""Howl,"" because at least Burroughs can write grammatically. Ah, it would be nice to be alive seventy years from now, when, with luck, critical standards in the arts will be on the upswing again..."
3,maybe I have to read it again,"You know Burroughs to me, is very hit or miss. Junky was a hit. Some of interzone was a hit.... But Naked Lunch to me, while I guess many consider it a great work of art, seems to me to be a rambling self indulgent diatribe. Again maybe I have to read it again, but I don't quite have the desire to do so. There are some good moments it the book. But since it's basically a junkie talking while on junk I didn't think I could relate. Burroughs was a fantasic writer with such a sharp mind, and occasionally I just think he is being lazy with it, masking bull for ART."
2,I tried...... but failed to finish. Good luck if you give it a go.,"I heard a story about the author on the ABC Radio. What an interesting story I thought. Author, gay??, married???, straight????, kills wife at dinner party, alcoholic, drug addict. How more interesting can it get? Well what the ...... it didnt make much sense. How can this be a literary masterpiece. I just dont get it. and I tried. good luck if you give it a go."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this with great intension to give it as a gift, but I ended up reading it myself.Most of the time I was trying to stay awake.Both the movie and the book are really boring, and I'm not sure why it reached such notable claim.I would recommend anyone wanting to read something like this to just bite the bullet and read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson. It paints a better image, and at least you'd be awake to enjoy it."
3,A reader,"After reading Junky and Queer, this book was a major disappointment. It is confusing, and not very well written. There is not real story here, just a lot of confusing rambling."
5,Brilliant? No. Fun? Yes,"I honestly had no idea what to expect when i opened this book and after reading a bit into it i still had no idea what was going on. But after a while i finally grasped onto the pace of the book and what was being written about, you can't attempt to make sense of what you are reading or you will be confused you have to just let the words grasp and play with your mind and you can try to make sense of it all later. The book is also very very funny at parts and very very graphic and distrubing at others, it is not for everyone, but i certainly enjoyed it"
4,either love it or hate it.,"this is not a book you read if you want to sit back and relax with something mindless. it took me a chapter or two to get use to his style of prose. but it was worth it, his images of a drug addicted life are stark and surreal. Some of his prose was pure poetry. when I finished this book all I could say was wow, you don't have to follow a set of rules about writing to create a masterpiece. sometimes all you need is orginality. The book of Burroughs letters to ginsberg is a great companion piece to this book."
3,"Powerful and shocking, but not necessarily profound","Naked Lunch will surprise you. I went into this book expecting complete absurdity and choas, but I found more choas than I thought possible. I read Naked Lunch for the Burroughs/Beat angle, but it is so completely different from other Beat Generation works (ie-Kerouac) that I didn't get much out of it in this respect.The writing is amazing. Burroughs' command of language is unparalleled and I found myself laughing out loud at some of the quirky phrases he uses. The writing also makes it hard to follow both the ideas and the ""plot"". I confess that I didn't get a lot of the ideas, but the sheer originality and creativity of the work makes it a worthwhile read."
1,"Boring, idiotic and Pointless","I picked up this book because of its reputation of being an underground classic. After suffering through this horrible ""work"", underground (DEEP UNDERGROUND) is where this tome belongs. Basically, the book is an unending montage of nonsensical images spliced in with bizarre homosexual occurances. You could literally pick out a page at random and still have an overall feel for the book. It can be simply described as a junkie with homosexual tendencies who prattles on and on, thinking he's interesting. Many have tried to have this book censored from schools, but that should never happen. Far from it. All juveniles should be FORCED to read it to see what happens when you're constantly stoned. A stronger anti-drug message could never be made. Stay away from this stupid book unless you just want to be bored senseless."
1,A fool's gold edition (50th Anniv.),"The Naked Lunch - 50th Anniversary EditionISBN: 978-0-8021-1926-1Grove Press2009Content:I will keep to the content of the book, for much criticism is available on the text.This edition presents comments by the author, divided in 4 texts in 13 pages, plus ""Burroughs Texts Annexed by the Editors,"" a selection of outtakes.Once I have decided the text is worth my attention, I do judge a book by the cover, therefore I feel this particular edition deserves harsh criticism, for the quality of the material used is just too poor.The 50th Anniversary Edition was a major let down for the paper is the cheapest anyone can find, already rough and dry to the touch and sure to become yellowed and brittle in no time, so this tricky US$24 hardback book in a luxurious slipcase is nothing but fool's gold."
2,Self-indulgent,"I enjoy reading literature, and am rarely disappointed when I read a book that has been labeled a classic. ""Naked Lunch"" is an exception. I had to force myself to finish this book, because it just did not really hold my interest at all. Although I could appreciate the dark, twisted, imaginative imagery, there was just no real story to speak of. There were hints of satire here and there, but then the prose would just descend into an incoherent mess. I can only recommend this book as a cautionary tale about the nightmarish, horrifying, delusional state that being a heroin junkie must put you in.For a more clear and coherent surreal pornographic nightmare, I'd recommend ""Story of the Eye"" ..."
3,I'm not going to lie...,"I'm not going to lie and say I even understood this book 90% of the time. What I'm going to say though, is that the book held my interest throughout. Burroughs use of language is enough to do that. There were numerous portions that made me laugh out loud, and equally numerous portions that made me cringe. Of course, I still didn't understand a word of it. So, in short, I'm not real sure what to make of it. My advice for anyone who is thinking about reading it is to give it a shot. If you're adventurous enough, you'll probably get something out of it, and if you hate it, you won't have to waste much time with it (I read it in about three days). It's something different, and that alone makes it worth reading."
1,Yawn....,"Having occasionally shared neighborhoods with junkies, I have always been amazed by how thoroughly uninteresting their lives are. This book confirms my view. It works really hard to make lives of junkies literary interesting, but fails since the material that the author works with is intrinsically dull. One cannot but help shedding a tear for all the trees that has been wasted making this all too thick book.(A disclaimer: If this book picks up in the second half I may be a bit unfair. Somehow I seriously doubt it. Particullarily because of the cutting technique that has been so much better applied elsewhere)"
5,Brilliant. An outstanding work from an outstanding mind.,"Some people believe that this book is nothing but some old junky rambling incoherently. I believe these people have no vision, no understanding, no comprehension of how this book works. Naked Lunch is not a plot neatly cut with stereotype characters and appeal for the lowest common denomenator. Naked Lunch is an experience; a bold, powerful, mind shattering text. A person, however, must keep an open mind. To do otherwise is to cut the circulation of thought completely. Personally I think that Naked Lunch, when properly recieved, is a literary milestone... Read it yourself and draw your own conclusions."
1,Awful Incoherent,This book is purportedly a classic? It is the worst thing I have ever read. Just rambling non-sense of a drug addict pervert.Not even interesting or well written.
1,Simply Awful,"I was tempted to read this book after reading several of Kerouac's, but was dissapointed to find nothing but the incoherent rambling of a brain dead dope fiend. It was neither enjoyable nor interesting. If this book had not been charged with obscenity, I doubt if it would be read by anyone at all. A Reader describes it excellently, ""to manipulate words into incomprehensible patterns of incoherent ideas."" It does not describe what it is like to be alive and free thnking; the book describes (poorly) death and the enslavement of the will by addiction. To make oneself unable to think and communicate by surfeiting on drugs does not make one a genius or an artist. The Naked Lunch is as artistic as a ceramic toilet."
3,????,"This novel is either the most profound revelational epiphany ever put into the form of print, or the biggest piece of garbagey fraud perpetrated on the literary world. I just can figure out which one!"
2,Canadian import,"This is a bad flick, but a good Blu-ray Disc. The picture quality is quite good, but since the movie has a very filtered/processed look, don't expect to see as much detail as you might on other Blu-ray releases. No extras, which is typical for Alliance. The region code of this disc is A, which means it will play on American machines but will probably not be playable in Europe. If you enjoy this flick, I recommend Corey Yuen's SO CLOSE with Shu Qi, Karen Mok and Zhao Wei."
3,The best thing about the movie is the trailer.,"This movie is more like a two part ""She Spies"". Mechanically done fight sequences, cheesy computer graphics (well, at least the computerized video scoring screens are a new idea for a karate movie), and loads of cute girls to stare at are worth the cost of renting the DVD. Tura Satana--where are you when we need you?"
4,"Good Fight Scenes, Weak Plot","Really enjoyed the fight sequences of the movie, I thought they were very well done. The basic plot of the movie was to sum it up in one word is....stupid."
3,Good movie but bad plot.,"DOA is a good movie but has a very bad plot. Jamie Pressly, Devon Aoki, Holly Valance. The movie is choregraphed by Corey Yuen. It is a great chick flick but the story needs a-lot of work. I know it's based on the popular video game."
4,"Well, it's a fighting movie with good looking chicks!","It's not bad, it's not material to an academy award but it's fun and can keep you entertained for its run, so, if you like martial arts and nice looking girls, this is the movie for you."
4,a real kick of an action flick,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. I got a real kick outof this flick. It has a decent story line, great action, and the babes are veryhot. It has everything you would want in an action movie. Eric Roberts is greatas the bad guy. Jaime Pressly and Holly Valance are super sexy and kick somemajor ass. This film was well worth the VOD rental price."
3,Review of Dead or Alive (DOA),"DVD was entertaining and special effects and stunts were done well. Babes were hot and kicked a** which is always fun and an acknowledgement that women can be attractive and also accomplished. Looking forward to seeing a sequel for this flick. Would have been improved with the addition of more sizzling Asian babes. Also, I appreciated the quick filling of this order by Amazon."
4,Excellent movie!,"I bought this sight unseen. I watched the movie and was happy that I bought it. Ok, ok... I bought it because Jaime Pressly and Devon Aoki are in it and Cory Yuen is the director.The movie would have been better WITHOUT Eric Roberts. He needs to realize his career peaked over two decades ago and retire.If you are a guy who likes movies for guys, you will enjoy this movie."
2,Aspect ratio incorrect (cropped) SD version.,"Amazon lists this standard def dvd as 1.66:1. The actual aspect ratio of this dvd is more like 2.35:1. The aspect ratio that it ""should"" be in is closer to 1.77 (aka 16X9). When comparing it to a broadcast version of 1.33:1, you can clearly see that the top and bottom are cut off on this dvd. This is especialy evident when viewing Jamie coming out of the water in her first scene. Face it, 90% of they buyers want this movie for the girls. Cutting off parts of their anatomy is just plain wrong. For those looking for the fights, it also cuts off action too. It is amazing that they actualy released a blu-ray of this. Silly predictable movie. Of course a clearer view of the girls is always prefered but why make it clearer if you don't see as much? I'm assuming that the blu-ray listing of 2.35:1 is correct for ""that"" release.I would like to see this in the aspect of the ""original un-masked celuloid negative""."
3,Dumb Over Arousing,"... yet entertaining. If you're in it for straight, brain-on-hold, action or VG to film authenticity then this is the film for you. As far as titillation goes, however, if Ms. Pressly and company acted any more masculine they'd be wearing jockstraps. A perfect gift for the video gaming feminist in your life."
4,"Suprisingly GOOD, maybe GREAT!!","Suprisingly a Really Great movie! (as far as ""movies based on video games"" go!.....no, really, it's pretty GOOD!)....Production Values, Stunts, Set Design,....very, very GOOD!!... ALL Actors seen commited to their roles and do a FINE JOB!!....(was IMPRESSED by JAMIE PRESSLY...one can tell she Worked Out for the role of Tina!)...but in spite of that...the Only REAL Criticism I have with this ""movie""...(again, a movie based on a video game)...is this,.....CASTING and COSTUME DESIGN!!!!In my opinion, DOA is ALL ABOUT strong, attractive, WOMEN!...if they had stayed True to the women and girls of the game, This could have been THE BEST MOVIE...(Based on a VIDEO GAME!!)....p.s. one last note on how Good this movie was.....I didn't notice Eric Roberts till the last 20 minutes or so...he didn't ruin it and was....O.K. in his role!!"
3,Girls kick ass,"I rented this DVD because a reviewer said that it was ""what Charlie's Angels should have been but wasn't"". I haven't played the computer game this story was supposedly modelled on so the characters were new to me. I can understand why the reviewer thought the way he did as it has a similar idea. Three females with different agendas face huge odds, multiple fight scenes, humerous situations, and still win out at the end. A bit long-winded in some of the fighting but still a better story than Charlie's Angels."
4,Booty booty booty,This is a fun film - something Bond can't do these day. Bootilicious babes who can kick a** in tiny bikinis - imaging merging Ursula Andress with Michelle Yeoh and a couple of hunky hunks - that's DOA.Not Academy Award material-lah but just fun.P/S Corey Yuen should direct a Bond flim. It would be a as bootilicious as Dr No and Thunderball. I miss the Pussy Galore in films today.
2,Really bad,I was tempted to turn this one off several times while watching it. I rented it because some guy on TV said it had good action. It didn't. The wire work was extremely obvious. None of the kicking or punching looked even close to real. The special effects were terrible. The sets were lame. The editing made the movie look like a BAD music video. The costumes looked like they came from a cosplay convention. The acting sucked. The story...I'm not sure what the story was.Street Fighter was a better video game movie than this.2 stars because one scene involving a country father and daughter made me laugh.
5,90210 Kung Fu,It's too cool to be a movie...probally why it started out as a video game...fun watch for the whole family.
2,Video Game?,"I don't know if there is a video game of this movie, but that's all it is. It is fight scene after fight scene, and in the wake of fight scenes from MI3, Matrix, and Transporter - the fight scenes aren't even really that good. At least the chicks are hot."
5,"We all love ""thank you "" !!","One of the best DVD from our Elmo's collection , everybody loves the ""thank you "" from the Top Banana section . Fully recommended for your toddlers' attention."
3,"Blood, Gore, and Guts, is it enough to please?","Deathstalker 3 is very appealing. It has all the action it needs to be a great movie. It starts out with our hero deathstalker searching for 3 magical stones that will lead to the riches of the world. The sexy young actresses (Carla herd, and Terri Treas)do a great job at acting. Though near the end the movie failed with a drawn out and hokey ending. But if your in the mood for action this is the flick."
2,Deathstalker 3,Deathstalker 3 Warriors from Hell isn't as good as Deatrhstalker 2 so now I know why this movie isn't on DVD but it completes the collection.
2,FOR D&D FANS ONLY!,There is only one reason I can think of to explain why anyone would read this so I don't have to tell you why I dislike Deathstalker III but even if you are a mstie you should think twice before watching it.
3,Hard to read font,The book may be good but the font is very incomfortable to the eyes. For those of us who after 45 require readers it is almost impossible to read. Maybe it should come in the kindle version so we can increase the font.
3,Pages Missing!,"My new Washington, D.C. Eyewitness Travel Guide is MISSING the first 24 pages.Can the seller please send me another copy of this book?D. Sparks"
5,"CHARMING, FUNNY, AND ROMANTIC",This is my favorite book of Nora Roberts. It is very easy to believe that these characters are real because she tackles issues that are true. The dialogue and content is amazing. Never once was I bored. Jed and Dora are hilarious and interesting. Their romance is sizzling and very hot! The suspense and mystery is also amazing. You never know what is going to happen. I would like to see a sequel to what happens to Jed and Dora. THIS IS NORA ROBERTS BEST BOOK EVER!
5,One of her best,"This is one of my favorite Nora Roberts books. I absolutely loved the character of Jed, and Dora is one of the best female protagonists Nora Roberts has written. She doesn't come across as needy, weak, or remotely unsympathetic -- she's strong and independent and still a lot of fun. There was no real ""mystery"" in this book -- you knew who was trying to steal and why -- but that's okay. I was so wrapped up in Jed and Dora's story that it didn't really matter what happened with the ""hidden riches""."
4,One of her best,"Loved this Nora Roberts book!I read as much Nora as I can get, and this one did not disappoint."
3,Good read!,I have gone through the JD Robb series and am waiting for the next release. So I turned to older stories that Nora wrote. I liked this one. It's good.
4,Riches Revealed,"As always, Nora Roberts continues to captivate her readers with a well-written and captivating tale. You'll love the suspense and intrigue as you see the two main characters drawn to each other and how they help each other to see things from a different perspective."
4,ONE OF NORA ROBERTS' BETTER BOOKS--,"I've read many of Nora Roberts' books, and this one was definitely more enjoyable for me than most as the main characters were not terribly abrasive, anal, or whiny. You did know who the villan was, but you had to read on to see where he/she would strike next. The low points were the story's slow beginning and the ending got a bit goofy. Overall it was a fun read."
4,Very Good-But not Robert's Best,"Hidden Riches takes a little bit longer to get going then most of Robert's books. It is well worth the wait, however, as Robert's eventually pulls in her trade mark suspense, mystery, and romance. I highly recommend it."
4,Hidden Riches Indeed!,"This is an earlier book by Herself that I had not previously read. Not sure how I managed to miss it, but it is well worth going back to find and read. The characters are well enough drawn and with enough complexity and humor that the book came close to her current work for a satisfaction factor. Not quite up to her J.D. Robb incarnation, but getting there!"
1,What a DUD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not waste your time!,"This must be one of the worst movies this yr-poorly acted, terrible plot, lousy actors, and very perdictable. I admit I rented this movie to see some shots of Kari Wuhrer but I did not see any-just 5 other babes who could not act at all-this looked like a movie made by Playboy productions-plenty of bare breasted chicks but no substance. What was Kari Wuhrer doing in this flop? At least she can act somewhat but in this one she seemed way above the rest of the cast because even her below par performance was far better than anyone else. In addition there were no shots of her in this movie which added to the disappointment--don't try this movie-you will be very disappointed if you are a Kari Wuhrer fan-the fox did not show it at all----"
1,probably the worst movie i ever seen in years,"this movie is totall junk, bad act, bad plot, bad actress, even the nude and sex scenes are annoying. this tile should go directly go tho garbage can. keep your money and stay away from this crap."
1,"worthless, thought i'd see horror not porn","this movie wasn't scary at all, except seeing how old the women look just 5 years out of college. there was one 'reunion' shot where there were some like 60 year old women, luckily they didn't show their breasts. plus, enough with the strangulation, horror movies don't have stranglers dressed like ninjas. i actually checked this out from the library and found myself wondering who does the movie selection for them. i probably would have liked it if i'd seen it on skinemax when i was like 15."
1,"Final Examination puts the s,u,c and k in suck","Self castration would be preferable to viewing this masterpiece of suckedness. You are sure to sustain massive eye injury due to the vicious amounts of eye rolling required to endure this horiffic tragedy. So please, before viewing this muck, blind yourself with hot fireplace pokers. You'll thank yourself later. Fred Olen Ray should be required to take hours off his lifespan and return them to the victims that suffered this calamity. Only would that I could express how much I loathed Final Examination."
2,FLUNKED WITH A CAPITAL F,"Disjointed....predictable..derivative. Those are just a few of the adjectives I attach to this sub-par slasher flick. The director had these five ""babes"" so to speak, so he had to make sure they each got their nude scene accompanied by lounge lizard music. They caress their bodies, play with their boobies and do all kinds of stupid things, just to show off their anatomical gifts. It's so poorly done that it's not the least bit titillating, pardon the pun. Add to this that not one of the ladies can act (Debbie Rochon is as usual repulsive in her attempts). Kari Wuhrer and Brent Huff as the cops should be ashamed of themselves for participating in this quickie. The plot is as predictable as they come and the extra twists at the end are only good for snickers.If slasher films continue to degenerate into pablum like this clunker, the genre should be retired. R.I.P."
1,simply awful...,"Awful play, awful dialogs, actors sound the same, all emotions are the same. In my opinion it's an awful movie... I stopped the DVD after watching the first hour."
5,sequel = necessary,"i heard they were coming out with the sequel soon which will be titled, ""Oral Examination."" supposed to be even better than the first!"
2,Not what is pictured,I payed more than twice what I could have purchased a NC3FX-BAG for because the picture is of a NC3FXX a completely different connector.
4,Life-changing!!,"If you don't want what you've always thought challenged... if you want to keep your head in the sand about what God says about children... if you want to miss out on unqualified blessings... don't read this book.... The information, challenge and exegesis are right on. ..."
1,guidance,"Like everything else in your life, let the Holy Spirit guide you to find out what's God's will for your family and the purpose for your life. The follower's of Jesus did not all have a quiver full, but their lives still had a great purpose for God! Depends on God's plan for your individual life.sex=babies...it would be selfish of me to not use birth control and God-given common sense for basing how many kids the Holy Spirit has impressed upon me to consider having. If left to God's laws of nature and not His Holy Spirit, I would have more than He's purposed me to have, by the laws of nature He's put into place. He is in control of my heart's desires too and Lord of them...I can trust in His still small voice for His wisdom in this matter, too. (For example, gravity is also a law of nature, and yet we are expected to work with it too using our God-given common sense!)"
1,peddling irresponsibility,"These folks, more or less a mouthpiece for the quiverfull cult, terrify me. The world needs less children not more.God gave you a brain, a sense of self-restraint, and hopefully, common sense. Pumping out kids simply because your biology allows it is both irresponsible and in this age, arguably unethical. The endorsement of such irresponsible behavior certainly is. Yes, if you try, the bulk of you can breed like rabbits, whether you pray to God or not. That doesn't make it a good idea, for you, your kids, or the rest of the planet.Moderation, folks. Take a more sensible route. 2 or less. Want more? Adopt. So many kids need good homes."
2,Irritatingly Written But Hard to Argue With,"Rick Hess argues from Scripture that Christian couples should not use birth control but trust their sovereign God to bless them with the number of children He will. Hess could have benefitted from having someone else actually write this book for him because his sarcastic tone reveals someone who is reacting to the wrong attitudes in our culture. It's irritating to find such good thoughts presented in so unpersuasive a style. Still, this is a perspective on family that Christians ought to think about. Read Hess's book with your Bible nearby, so you can read the verses he quotes in their original context."
5,Incredible!,"I read this when I was a teenager. I am now 27, and this book has always stayed with me...yes, it is that powerful. I loved this book not only because it was beautifully written, but because the characters were so real. Mr Tom might be a gruff, saddened old man on the exterior but on the interior...oh, ok...I'll let you read it for yourselves."
5,A great WW2 book.,"This book took place during WW2. An abused child,Will, is sent out to the countryside where he lives with Mr. Tom. In the countryside he realizes who he is and how he can be himself. He makes friends and starts standing up for what he believes in. Most think this is a good thing, but could it end up costing will his life? This is a great book and I haven't heard of one person who didn't like it."
5,Overall A GREAT book,"I bought this book a couple of years ago and tried reading it, but couldn't get into it. I finally decided to read it for school recently and put off reading it until the last minute. As it turns out, that didn't matter much because once I started it, I couldn't put it down. Good Night, Mr. Tom is a wonderful book! While it does have its sad moments, it also has many happy moments, so it generally evens out. I just want to say that if you're thinking about reading Good Night, Mr. Tom, don't change your mind. You definately won'te regret it! What a read!"
4,Worth reading!,"Goodnight Mister Tom is simple and understated as a novel, yet it makes you think about it long after you've finished reading. The characters were wonderful."
4,Gary mcdermaids reveiw for goodnight mister tom,Good night mister tom is a extramly good book it shows the way that parent can neglect children and miss treat them
5,Good Night Mr. Tom,I thought that this book was a very good book to read. I thought that it gave a lot of details and it was very interesting and exciting. This book was sort of hard to understand because Mr. Tom said different words funny. I really liked the part where Mr. Tom went over to London to try to find Will at his house. I also liked the part where Will was taken from his hospital bed and brought back to Mr. Tom's home. The ending left me hanging because at the end he said Dad I'm growing. I would give this book about five stars.
1,Graphic scenes are unnecessary,"This novel details a wonderful relationship between a boy, and a man and his village who open the boy's eyes to the world outside of his mother's over-zealous religious thinking. My problem with the book is the chapter called, ""Home"" where the author goes into great detail about the physical abuse the boy went through at the hands of his own mother, and the image of an infant dying in the small boys' arms. Who wants to read violence against children in such great detail?Overall the story is nice, and provides a good fictional overview of WWII. The author took the mother's religious overzealousness way too far in the descriptions."
1,"Goodnight Mr. Tom, the Worst Book Yet","i think that this book was a very boring and meaningless book. the characters had no significance or any special character traits. alos, the writeer does not know how to catch the reader's attention even in the most tense moments. its a shame that this book was even printed out for readers."
4,A Warm and Touching Novel.,"""Goodnight,Mister Tom."" was an enjoyable, touching novel which showed the growing relationship between an eight year old evacuee called Will, and a lonely old man called Tom, who takes him in during the second world war. As Will grows from a scared, beaten little boy, to an older, happy, healthy one, the characters like Zach , George and carrie all help to make Will confident enough to learn to read and write. There are many more things that Will and his friends do together which will make you laugh and cry. Overall this was an excellent book which many will enjoy and want to read again and again."
5,An Empowering Story,"This book has the power to make you laugh, cry, and want to sing. It is a story of a young boy learning how to live life with joy and without fear, and an old man remembering how to live life. This book is like a dear friend to me. When every I am unhappy I come and read this story, and I feel that my passion for life is renewed. An excellent book for people of all ages."
5,Loved it since eighth grade,"I read this book in eighth grade, and I have loved it ever since. If you like to chat about books, feel free to check out my blog: www.sarahsbooktalk.blogspot.com"
4,"""Good Night, Mr. Tom""","I have been recently reading this book at school in my language arts class. I enjoy a lot, and Michelle Magorian is a great author, and I would recommend this book to a 6th or 7th grader. However, some parts in this book made me a little sick - just a warning to those who have not read this book. I love the setting in the book, which takes place during World War II. For those who aren't into fantasy or science fiction like me, then this is a good book to read."
5,LOVED IT!!!,"Paul Silano is my LA teacher. We read this book in class and I loved it. He asked us ""On a scale of 1-10 1 being horrible and 10 being Excellent what would you rate it?"" and a lot of people gave it 8+ -it was a great book! When you read this book carefully, you'll notice quite a few clues about what is happening!! The author also writes good books. I think that this book is great for grades: 5+! Adults too!"
2,Difficult to get into.,"I really like scifi/fantasy titles and pick up many of the free books. This one caught my eye, but I just couldn't get into it. After a couple chapters I gave up."
4,Unique,"I am not a big fan of sci-fi books (mainly secluded to Kurt Vonnegut), but this book was engrossing. It wasn't a great literary feat, but it kept me interested. It is good FICTION."
1,Terrible,I really despised this book. I thought it was boring and preachy. Don't waste your time on this one.
5,A little info for you,"Well first off many of the other reviews say this anime is a copy of Tenchi. The reason this is is because it is a prequal to Tenchi. My proof is the fact that Genbu is in Dual. Genbu is also in Tenchi GPX. Also at the end of the series they say they are going to colonize space. Well in Tenchi space is colonized. If your an anime fan or a new comer I deeply suggest bying this. It is my favorite anime, the only downfall of this series is the lack of episodes."
1,Poor choice,I have owned this for a about 1 year and I have yet to get it to work. It keeps defaulting to some preset stride length and the time I spent on resetting and rereading the instructions was a huge waste of time. Save your money and time.
3,Great for Bionicle Lovers,This game is great for Bionicle lovers. It brings out the intrigues created by the Bionicle story. Not all kids will find this as exciting as some other games.
3,Critical Mass: you can see it!,"I purchased this book for a former office mate who was an N-weapons designer. A copy of this book (hardcopy) is frequently visible in the background book shelf on the Today show (NBC -- AMs): the hardbound dust jacket has a red stripe on the top and the bottom, a white background middle on the binding with gold lettering for the title. You can't quite read the title, but it is very distinctive behind many Today-show guests.Burrows is only a reporter and bound to get some details wrong, but he has assembled some interesting photos including claimed photos of SA-weapons vaults. Not a bad book. Full eveluation will be difficult."
4,"All single versions, and all good","Rare Earth was a group you had to look at twice to believe they were white. Motown thought a lot of them - in fact, they named their ""Rare Earth"" label after them.This CD contains single versions (i.e. less than 4 minutes long) of all their top 40 hits - and the single versions of ""Get Ready"" and ""(I Know) I'm Losing You"" are decent edits of the much longer album tracks (and if you are of my vintage, this is the way you heard them in the car). Besides the six top 40's, there are 14 other tracks representing B-sides, rarities and key album tracks. Unfortunately, there is no information in the package about which are which (thus, 4 stars instead of five).Sound quality is very good. You'll need to find it used, as it has been discontinued for awhile."
4,Great deal,"I had a hard time finding this product elsewhere, but this supplier not only had what I was looking for , they offered it at a great price. I am completely satisfied, will use them again."
2,Half hearted effort on what should have been Herculean.,"I was REALLY excited about this release, until I started to go into the details. (1) A Hercules set WITHOUT Hercules Unchained, this has been crying out for an anamorphic transfer for donkeys' years. It's great if the other titles are in 2:35:1, and if Unchained was there, I would have bought it just for that, but alas, it was not to be and (2)a small point, the cover art is actually from Goliath and the Barbarians, which is NOT in the collection. I'm afraid I'll have to pass, it's a pity Image could'nt have tried a little harder on this one, it really would have been worth the effort."
1,Doesn't work,I installed this into my car and it did not work. I had suspicions that this would be the case when I noticed that the package was written in broken English. It's a shame I have to give this even 1 star.The car adapter that I purchased at Walmart worked without any problems.
3,Nice...but one issue,"Nice unit, does what it promises. However three adapters get a bit tight. There should be more spaceing between plugs."
3,Multiple charger adapter,"This is great! Now I can have all of my electronics (XMRadio, GPS and cell phone) running or charging in the car at the same time, especially helpful on long trips. I store it in the deep bin between the front seats. Sometimes when I'm dropping items in the bin, mainly the small heavy container of quarters, I'll hit the adapter and it will disconnect. A little frustrating but now that I'm aware of it, I try to drop items away from the adapter."
4,Useful and does not take a lot of space,I bought it because the previous one is too big. This one does not take a lot of space and equally efficient.
2,Beautiful bulb but didnt last,"This is a beautiful bulb, but didnt last more than 2 months. That isnt very long for an expensive bulb."
1,"Received bulb that did not work and paid too much to have it shipped to me in the first place, not worth it to return.",Got the lightbulb and it did not work. It would cost more than its worth to return. I already paid alot to have the bulb shipped to me in the first place. I was going to use it in a stained glass lamp that I have but when I plugged it in no light. It is not the lamp because I put a regular bulb in and it worked fine. Not happy with my purchase.
1,"So pretty, but doesn't last!",I absolutely loved this bulb and had very high hopes for it. It looks beautiful when it works but mine quit working after only one week. I would not recommend it. Very disappointing...
5,Pretty bulb that lasts and lasts,Nice faux stained-glass bulb which can add sparkle to a dull area or shade. Each section is painted to look the part and each is separated with strong black resin to simulate the lead. The thing that amazes me about these bulbs is their life. I recently had one go and replaced it... after 7 years of being on every day. I don't know why these seem to last so long but it's an added bonus of an already cool product.
5,This is a treasure!,"If you like to have your mind opened and the way you see life expanded and deepened, buy this. This is not a story of evolution in a chronological fashion. It's more about our relationship to the universe, explained by one who has a rich knowledge of science and love's bringing it all together so that others can understand. I bought the newest DVD of Brian Swimme's, Journey of the Universe, first, but I like this lecture series much better as it is told from a deeper perspective. Very full and rich. Oh and the price, it's worth every penny and more, it's the kind of thing you'll be able to watch and share for years and never get tired of it (you'll still be getting things from it you missed before)."
4,This is indeed a great encyclopedic companion to the journals.,"This is indeed a great encyclopedic companion to the journals. Ahhh, so that's what a ""burning glass"" is! Oh, ""camas"" does that to the digestive system? Etc."
5,Captured a Moment in Time,"Impeccably dressed, right down to the ribbons in her hair& the ring on her finger.A most lovely figure in crimson velvet.She fits perfectly in a Victorian setting, or Victorian decor!"
5,Very good book,I enjoyed reading this book and it was very helpful. They did a good job of breaking the book up into sections and you can just read the areas that are most important to you at the time and the others at a later time. I enjoyed reading this book and will refer to it time and time again.
4,Tasty Tea,"This tea is nice and strong with a good lemon flavor. It's a nice afternoon pick-me-up. I love Revolution and Republic of Tea teas and this one did not disappoint. I still prefer Earl Grey in the mornings, but this tea will also hold up to cream."
4,The Classic Work on Which the Discipline is Based,All modern work in design and analysis of experiments traces its roots back to this 1920 classic. Not for the math-phobic.
2,L homme orchestre..,"De Funes, what i remember on past years, he is a good comedien, happened that this special movie of him is not good at all..i am sorry that i choose a wrong one.If you expecting a good movie you will be disapointed."
5,Superb work brought the meaning of warfare to a new level,I read this book in 1970 and was astounded. I was teaching a course in military history to an advanced military officer course. Everyone was very appreciative of Ropp's work and even 34 years later it sticks in my mind as seminal.
4,This is NOT everything filmed in Hendrix's set,"There were two songs performed and filmed at Woodstock that are not on this set: ""Master Mind"" and ""Gypsy Woman"". Hendrix didn't sing them, other band members did, and therefore Experience Hendrix didn't want to include them. They essentially over-ruled Jimi, who felt the songs were important enough to include in his set.It's disgusting that Larry Lee's guitar parts are practically audibly non-existant and the two songs are missing, because they don't want to pay royalties. What's worse, though, is that they claim that this is the complete set, which is simply a lie."
4,What's the difference?,Can anyone tell me what the difference is between this and the 2008 BD release? Is it just that this one includes the DVD's?
5,Rally Trophy,"Great game. Very realistic, excelent graphics, true to life physics. Highly recomended!!!"
4,For anyone who wants to take stress/loading seriously.,"Begin as an ameteur and after spending time with all the resources in this book you can design with confidence. Each theory is broken down, well layed out, useful pictures, and tough problems, but with answers! Misses a star because it somewhat incorrectly places maximum bending stress under a load, a common error among authors. Also, fails to show short cut routes."
3,Chinese Eye Opener,"Father and son bonding movies are rare in Hollywood, so we go to China in 2002 to see an epic coupling of an adopted violin prodigy and his peasant father. Cheng Kaige writes with melodramatic familia yearnings. The tears flow as dad gets his thirteen-year-old smart aleck kid to the best teachers in Beijing with its enormous populations.This is a real snapshot of a confused modern China. It's as today as any shopping mall or skyscraper in the USA, but at the same time the city has housing without amenities. This one is an eye opener for Americans that think China will be in the backwater very long.Hong Chen is a modern Chinese woman with Madonna clothes. She beds businessmen for money. Hong says it is hard work, and she does seem to acquire cheating louses. Young Xiao Chun falls for her and sells his violin to buy her a coat, which creates much confusion. How is Xiao going to be a famous violinist without a violin? Violinists seem to be rock stars in China."
4,CHINESE MELODRAMA,"Very well put together film portraying the choice a young man has to make between personal success and family. I watched many films like this but of poor quality and in black and white, when I lived in Hong Kong 35 years ago. It would not be accurate to describe it as soap opera but it is certainly melodrama.There are many better films than this coming out of modern China. I would recommend King of Masks before this one as a slick tear jerker that has superb acting (including the monkey) throughout. There are outstanding scenes of China and old Chinese village life. The cinematography and technical aspect of the film is superb."
4,Dah Shinin' is Shining,"After this album came through over 6.5 years ago, it has been on my heavy rotation. With tracks like ""Hellucination"" and ""PNC,"" the Brooklyn duo put themselves on the map and out of the shadow of Blac Moon. A must have."
3,"good debut album, but it still is lacking","The underground hip hop group Smif N Wessun are comprised of rappers Tek and Steele. The beats were produced by Da Beatminerz. The rapper's subject matter is not breaking any ground, it's basically just about guns, living in the projects, urban paranoia, drugs and violence. Pretty much everything we have heard in hip hop before. But the beats can be captivating at times. They are filled with scratchy drums, distant, jazz samples and deep bass. Other than that, this debut album is nothing new. It is underground because it did not reach the mainstream and rightfully so, the different beats probably prevented it from being a pop record. But again, the lyrics are just nothing different. The rapper's voices are not distinct enough to really tell who's who."
4,There Shinin Dah',This is some very good hardcore rap from the NYC from the 1990s these guys are some members of the Original Gun Clappaz.Cocoa Brovasz-Steele & Tek are pretty good with the micraphone and the Beatminers do good on the boards mining some hot beats all in all this is an excellent release from Smif-N-WessunAlso recommended-Black Moon-Heltah Skeltah-OGC-ONYXLyrics 9/10 Production 9/10 X Factor 9/10 Classic 9/10 Me 8/10Overall=44/50 This album gets an 88% that means 4.5 Mics
5,small business router is perfect,"We run a small business that uses 3 computers and a common printer. We nedded a good, reliable router so we could all be on the internet at the same time and print from the same printer.With this perfect low cost solution, we installed our own small business network and haven't touched it since installation. It is the best investment money we have spent on our business so far!Highly recommend this product to all homes and businesses that want a good stable network solution."
2,Disappointing...,"If you want to buy this DVD/CD expecting you will receive Hancock's ""Possibilities"" album, you will not. The CD contains only 4 songs, and the DVD is a sort of documentary film about how the album was recorded. The DVD itself might be considered interesting if you are a huge jazz fan, but be aware that this is not the full album."
3,I thought I was getting the movie & full CD,"I probably didn't read the description carefully enough, so make sure you do. That said, the 4 song bonus outakes CD is very good! Herbie shines a bit more there."
5,opens you up to possibilities!,you gotta see this.....it's amazing....i sent it to all my friends and they all raved.....fantastic studio footage.....great creativity.....it's like being in the studio with all these great people..........
2,Nixon Lodown review,This watch is good looking and comfortable but as a collector of watches I was extremely disappointed by the overall quality for the price since the blue coloring of the actual watch began to scrape off of it indicating that the color is painted on and therefore subject to ugly scrapes and gouges.
2,Nixon Lodown,"Nice style and look but after owning it for less than a year, brand new the case cracked and broke where it connects to the band, making it unwearable. Only option is to send it into Nixon to have a technician examine, either way it costs $22 to send in and even under warranty dose not cover ""wear and tare"". Pretty lame considering it retails for over $100. Consider this before purchasing."
1,The Low Down,"As you can read with the other reviews poor quality is a huge issue with this watch.I had the watch 2 days and it malfunctioned, It took 3 calls to Nixon (I finally gota hold of the customer service supervisor)to get them toissue a repair order. When I took the watch to the post office to Mail it back to Nixonthe person behind me saw my box and laughed, he had the same watch and had to send it backtwice.The Nixon Lowdown is a very good looking and comfortable watch, however for $90 you would think Nixoncould invest in quality and customer service.Be warned:1. Many retailers will no longer take returns on Nixon Watches2. If you have to return the watch to Nixon they require you to give them a credit card on ALL returns3. This watch is complicated to set4. The small print on the instructions tells you not to press the buttons underwater - an important detailGood Luck"
1,TERRIBLE,"I got this watch for Valentine's Day for my boyfriend.. it was a piece of crap. It looked nice but within the first week it had 2 scratches, and then (after him being really careful) 2 weeks after that it just stopped working (and it wasn't a battery problem). Dont waste your money on this cheap thing."
1,bad!,"I am so frustrated! We bought a yellow lodown....and within two weeks the band was discolored. The store would not take it back, but Nixon said they would replace it. It has been 1.5 months, and now they tell me they only have black or white and new colors may be available in June! Really? Spend $125 on a watch and it will take 5 months to replace it! Don't buy one! The bands discolor immediately and then you are just SOL!"
2,"difficult to set and reset, instructions are poorly written.","I really like the size and functions of this watch. But even with the instructions my friends and I found this watch really confusing to use. You better be really patient, or preferably have the store set up the watch for you."
1,Nasty,It gets really dirty really fast and it is really expensive and it sucks i hate it alot alot alot of i want one ots 80$ so screw it
2,Broke within 15 minutes,"Watch looks great and has potential to be extremely useful. After attempting to set the time the watch went blank, reset and now has ROM fail displayed at all times which means the chip that stores all the info is useless...."
2,Poor quality!,"Ordered the Lodown for my 11 year old son for his birthday. After approximately 6 mos of use, the watch started to constantly reset itself. We replaced the battery but the watch continued to reset itself willy-nilly. The screw bracket where the band meets the case also broke without very much force. The last straw was when the watch started to beep continually - it seemed to be frozen. Had to remove the battery just to shut it up! Wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing. Nixon may be the cool watch to have but this model is very poor quality for $90.00 plus shipping! Went to the Nixon website and they want a $67.00 pre-authorization on my credit card in case the repair doesn't fall under warranty. That cost, coupled with the cost of postage to mail the watch to them, is prohibitive! I might as well buy another watch for what that might cost me! I won't purchase another Nixon."
2,Lodown has problems,"I received this watch as a gift for Christmas and was very excited. It worked great, was complicated to set but that's no reason for a bad review. Then about a month and a half later, the watch malfunctioned showing ROM error. Did a bit of research found out that this wasn't a unique problem, Nixon was reasonable to fix it but I don't understand why I paid 100$ for a watch that broke so quickly."
5,Good buy,"I just bought this watch for my brother who is in the Navy. So far, he has really enjoyed it."
4,Great watch... might have issues its constantly wet,"I really love this watch. The style, screen look, button layout.. all great. The only issue I have is with it's claim that it is a ""completely waterproof"" watch. It is designed with surfers in mind (contains tide info for 200 beaches around the globe until the year 2016) but I got caught in a torrential downpour one afternoon and sadly my watch did not survive. I did love the watch so much though that I recently ordered another but I will probably will not be taking it into the water."
3,Plops to a conclusion,"Yes the leads are excellent. Yes the scenery is lovely. Yes that is one good looking woman. Yes the tale has a tension hanging over it. Guess what folks? That's not enough for a good film.The eventual coupling of these two folks, all over the cover of the box yet lasting a few seconds but still too long, struck both me and my wife as incomprehensible. (And I know what we ""learn"" at this moment, which wasn't surprising to me.) This woman, who has truly sacrificed for her children, would not risk pregnancy here. Would she? This life of hunger and fear and desperation and worry and privation would not be enhanced by a baby. Nope---we found it implausible, distracting, and all too obligatory.And the grainy black and white film of collapsing buildings and frightened refugees only shows how ""unreal"" the color scenes were. We never truly felt engaged."
1,not mac compatible,"bought this as a christmas gift in November, found out after giving it that it was not mac compatible though the seller did not indicate this anywhere on the page, had to get the gift back after the 30 day return policy.....amazon allowed for the late return but charged for the return shipping! Why do they not indicate that it is not macintosh compatible?"
2,"wanted to like it, but...","I love the idea behind this book, the energy, the passion. But I found the writing itself fell short--reaching for easy emotional outs instead of innovative or original thinking, or even interesting word play. As a woman of color, I am behind what these women are doing, but I still found much of the writing in here weak. An occasional piece showed promise, but the editing was uneven, and too much of the work seemed like diary entries: emotionally strong, but creatively lacking."
2,Really!?......,"I am a huge fan and love the first five seasons, but come on season six has been horrible.....absolute garbage. Remember ""Who Pooped The Bed"" now try and think of an episode from season 6, big difference huh??"
2,Surprisingly Lackluster Season,"First, I just have to say that I'm a huge fan of Sunny. One of my favorites for the last few years. I have to say though, the writing for this season was about 2 rungs lower on the ladder than any other season. What's to blame? Was it Dee being pregnant? Was it the fact that her husband (Mack) is the main writer for the show? Are they struggling to find new ways to push the envelope? Have they developed the existing characters as far as they can go?Regardless of the cause, I'd say that if you're a casual watcher of this show, purchase a different season and maybe wait until this season is played on Comedy Central. If you're a die hard fan like me, I'm sure you've already seen this season and will buy the DVD just to keep your collection intact."
5,the perfect addition,I picked up this season to round out my collection and couldnt be more pleased. The sunny in Philadelphia series is one of my favorites and I got it at the best price I could track down online without sacrificing quality or service! A+
4,The gang is back!,I must admit I thought this series was lost. Indeed Season 5 had been quite bad but here there is a distinct return to fomr for our Philly loosers. Again they are able to tackle unpolitically correct issues with little taste in a hilarious way. very funny.
3,in a rut,"The show is in a bit of a rut, still better than anything else on tv... olsen was pregnant, they where trying to work around it. we have to keep ratings up! They WILL make a comeback!!! Lets face it, this is what we all look forward to in fall/winter. If ratings fall we will lose the show all together."
4,Always Sunny,"It is one of my favorite shows, so it is always funny and a show I can watch repeatedly and still laugh....."
5,Another hilarious season.,"very funny show comparable to arrested development, curb your enthusiasm, and the office. it's about self absorbed people that find themselves in bizarre situations."
2,Season 6 is not that Sunny,"The critics of this season are correct, but with one caveat: Your frame of reference. As a follow-up to seasons 1-5, the sixth season of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a big disappointment. The previous seasons set the bar high, and as long time fans sit down to watch this season, they expect that same level of greatness. The cast, and especially the writers, did not deliver. The performances were phoned-in, the stories were lacking, and the season finale was rehash of year old special that many fans had already seen. However, for many, this will be their first exposure to the show. For people who don't know any better, it will be funny and entertaining (and not a let down). In a way, these people are lucky, because as they watch previous seasons they're in for a treat.So the bottom line is that this season is not as good as past seasons, in fact, in comparison it's bad. On its own, it's just okay."
