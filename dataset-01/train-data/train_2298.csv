3,Atmospheric but Bogus,"Oh please, there isn't 5 minutes of truth in this thing. However, some of the acting is fine (especially Caine whom I love despite his frequent screams) and by the guy who played Sergeant Godley and another fellow who played a slimely newspaper reporter for ""The Star"".. But this 4 hour CBS miniseries tells us that Aberline wasn't married (he was) and strongly suggests that the American actor Richard Mansfield was a prime suspect-he was not. In an interview published way after the events of 1888, Aberline thought that Godley had arrested the Ripper-a Polish emigre barber-surgeon named George Chapman--no relation to victim #2. So what of the premise of this whole production?But the mini-series (which I taped in November of 1988 and still watch occasionally) does have beautiful costumes, wonderful sets, and a snappy pace. But don't believe a word of it."
2,ripped of fans,"This movie is excellent, but the format sold to the US viewer is inferior to that that I see made available to other countries. Standard edition? Why is the non US viewer able to acquire the film in widescreen?"
4,Jack thr Ripper,"This is an extremely entertaining and a very good dramastisation of the Whitechapel murders. It may not be a classic, but with its strong cast and excellent period detail, it is a thrilling story and will keep you entertained through out the movie. Inspector Abberline and Sergeant Godley were real-life people, as were others in the flim, so I did enjoy the short follow up after the end of the movie. This one I will enjoy watching again."
5,the best mini series ever,"it has been 20+ years since i have seen this mini series which did air on CBS,i believe this is Michael Cains best work,the supporting cast makes this who done it the best Jack the Ripper ever!!!The production of this series is top notch,this dvd will keep you on the edge of your seat as well making your own deducting on who Jack the Ripper really was."
4,as good as it gets,I was surprised that this is such a strong current sound for a band with such a great pop history. it rocks with the best of todays acts
4,Not a waste of your money,"I don't know what DVD Thumper saw, but the quality of each scene on the DVD I received was very good. There were some pleasant surprise in the Extra Scene category. If you like seeing your favorite stars nude this is the video for you."
2,disappointed,"I was hopping this would be a continuation of Saucy 70's volume 1 - it's not. Where Vol. 1 was a sneaky peek of many of the stars I fantasied about in my youth, Vol. 2 was just a bunch of naked European (mostly) women I didn't know."
2,Issue,"Product body was ""severly"" defective, nessitating the extensive use of heavly modifided ""stringers"" to complete this model. For the amount of money spent on this model I WILL NOT be making another purchase!!!"
4,"Nice, unpretentious mid-tempo bluegrass","Dudley Connell and others pitch in on this relaxed, understated set, with plenty of plain, sentimental, old-fashioned vocal numbers and a gentle sawing fiddle and slow, plunky banjo. These fellas were in no hurry to get anywhere fast, just sittin' around having a fun time playing the goodle stuff. The way we like it."
3,Very short.,This is a beautifu book wth great art and pictures. It's a very simple book that is maybe written for children just learning of the subject matter. The book is quite short but very colorful and engaging in it's commentary. My grandchild who is 7 years old read the whole thing in one hour. It's well written it just needs to be longer.
4,Cromwell - Movie - Fair Telling,"I had little historical backgound on this person but the movie treated the subject so that I could understand it. I can not comment on the acting since I do not know what good acting looks like. But, I like the flow of history and the characters. The small items in the movie added understaning to life in this period: the King's attitudes, the meals, the King playing with his children, the fact that Cromwell was leaving to go to America at the begining (history would have been quite different if he had)"
3,Historical Drama with Considerable Liberties Taken,"This DVD edition of the Richard Harris film looks good and might rouse a few British history students who are naturally inclined, but too much license is taken with fact. Richard Harris plays Cromwell as a sullen Puritan and Timothy Dalton* an effete ineffect-ual. Dorothy Tutin** and Alec Guiness, however, walk away with the movie in their performances as the English monarchs upon whom Civil War is thrust.For pageantry and period war scenes, this film is recommended. Otherwise, pick up a book to learn more about Cromwell and the foundations of modern day Parliament!Particularly pricey, too, considering it is sans special features which could have been so easily and bountifully provided!*Much better in LION IN WINTER**Even more delightful in the BBC miniseries THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII (she plays Anne Boleyn to perfection!)"
1,Cromwell Stinks,"I don't recommend it. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad"
3,"Cromwell, a view into the Republic of Britain","Cromwell, a movie released in 1970 is a Protestant's answer to Man for All Season's. Richard Harris plays Oliver Cromwell, the man who clashed with King James the 1st in the decades immediately following the reformation movement. King James, the head of the protestant church of England but married to a Catholic wife, is elegantly played by Alec Guiness. He has taken a villain that the writer of the movie may have intended to be more negative and made him into a rather sympathetic character. While Cromwell's zeal as a puritan seemed overly acted by Richard Harris, the movie did reveal some interesting facts about the time period in England. For History Buffs this Movie would be a plus, but with the exception of Alec Guiness, it is not near as great as the events it portrays. We need a remake!"
4,Good movie,"This film does a fairly good job of representing Cromwell and the conflict with King Charles I. Alec Guinness certainly looks the part of Charles. Some comments by previous negative reviewers are outrageous and totally unwarranted. Cromwell was a complicated figure, with good and bad characteristics, but was nowhere near the level of a Hitler-like dictator as one reviewer suggests. Richard Harris's performance suggests some of the ambiguity of Cromwell's nature. Cromwell did do a lot for religious toleration. He was not a raving lunatic like some would have you believe. Warfare and politics were ruthless in those days, and Cromwell sometimes had to follow suit."
4,desperate crossing,part documentary and part drama makes it easy to understand more our Christian heritage.
1,"The historical Irony, the Vengeance, of the Irish Harris playing the killer Cromwell","how Irishman Harris could have so gloriously portrayed Cromwell, who initiated the total destruction of the Irish nation, people, language, religion and culture is beyond comprehension, unless he purposefully portrayed him over the top in a guerrilla effort to sabotage this hero-making of a vile and brutal dictator.Harris later made repentance to our Irish history inThe Field, a far more interesting film."
1,Do not glorify the Butcher of Ireland,"Anyone who knows the history of the British Isles knows that Cromwell's attitude toward and treatment of the Irish mean that he belongs right with Adolph Hitler. The misguided attempt to glorify this miserable, murdering wretch isn't criminal but ought to be. No, I don't blame the actor (who apparently thought there would be more accuracy in the portrayal of the protagonist but no doubt was powerless to keep those scenes in - so he was misled and played the fool); I blame those who wrote and produced this atrocity.History shows many appalling instances of unwarranted genocide, many related to tyrants' desires to force religious choices, and Oliver Cromwell and Adolph Hitler lead the pack. To portray this monster in any other way is total dishonesty and clearly revisionist history."
4,Cromwell,"Very well done historical story. Great actors. Gives a good understanding of the times. Amazing that those times are so long ago, but basically politically nothing in the world has changed compared to hundreds of years ago."
5,"A colourful and concise, if not entirely accurate film","It is hard to begin to imagine what an awesome task presents itself when one undertakes to portray such a complicated and turbulent era in british constitutional and political history but I believe that Ken Hughes has succeded with this film although certain important historical facts have been ignored (eg; Oliver Cromwell was not one of the five members of parliament whom Charles tried to arrest personally). I presume this was done for dramatic effect. Alec Guinness's interpretation of the vacillating, glacial Charles is in my opinion the most detailed and perfect of his entire career. And I also liked Harris as Cromwell although many have criticised his performance of this complex and elusive character."
2,misbegotten history & a misbegotten star,"this went up from one * in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles II, but otherwise its just a mess. the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble, but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes, who also gave us such film masterpieces as ""casino royale"" and ""chitty chitty bang bang"". richard harris is his usually unrestrained self, and thats not a compliment. now, i wont even go into the politics, which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero: as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas's paean to charles I in ""twenty years after"", but nowhere near as entertaining."
2,Cromwell: Good film about an evil butcher,"I'm Irish. Cromwell was the Butcher of Ireland. This is a well made film, but its near-total disregard of Cromwell's genocidal Irish campaign, (and of the heroic opposition to that butchery by elements of his New Model Army, Levellers and Diggers among them), renders the film a profound disappointment. Shame on Richard Harris (RIP) for not insisisting that the Rape of Ireland be at least prominently mentioned in this biopic.In songwriter Terry Woods' words, ""A curse upon you, Oliver Cromwell, you who raped our Motherland! I hope you're rotting down in the hell for the horrors that you sent to our misfortunate forefathers when you robbed them of their land. To Hell or Connacht! May you burn in hell tonight!""..."
3,not quite there...,"Superpitcher is to me a great producer, tracks like Happiness, Speicher 35, remix of the MFA all are amazing work. Superpitcher's track selection makes for a potentially great journey, however the mixing is what throws me off here. Rather dissapointing... when you can EASILY hear the track transitions, almost like getting to the end of the record where you need to make a last minute mix (transition. 1 to 2, 5 to 6, 8 to 9, 9 to 10, 10 to 11) - still some great tracks that are pushing progressive electronic music to the next level (Spark, Leuchtturm, Dinamo, Wurz+ Blosse), just wished for a tighter mix -I recommend James Holden's Balance 005 and ""at the controls"", Hernan Cattaneo's sequential mix and Chis Fortier's Balance 007 that have it really tight -"
3,False Advertisng,"Yes, you get less than half of what's pictured. You get the awl on the right, two needles and one spool. The awl itself whether made with really cheap wood or that the metal bits seem alright. It the idea that someone shows, by picture, one thing and then sends something less than you paid for it. I see that as false advertising and technically illegal. I'm will wait to see if the vendor follows through with sending the rest. No doubt probably not!"
4,It Works,For some reason the needle would Not tighten down In the hole and You only get the one shown In the right side of the picture and comes with 2 needles but It did work. The shipping was reasonably quick.
2,Ignore the picture,"The image of this product is inaccurate. You only get the handle, two needles, a needle wrench and the thread that's installed on the handle.The shipping was very slow. I ordered may 19 and received it on June 2."
2,Picture dose not represent the product,"In the picture there is an awl handle two awl needles and a spool of waxed cord.In reality there is no spool of waxed cord, only a small anount of cord wound on a spool inside the handle."
5,Excellent product,"Works extremely well, easy to use, strong durable parts, efficient storage of small parts. Saves tons of money on leather goods. Fixed leather shoes with this. Plan to use on jackets, hobby gear etc.. Really an all around great product at a great price. Delivered on time."
3,Not comprehensive,"The basis for selecting the artists for this book seems to be (1) the art editors' whim, and (2) Western-centric values and standards of what makes the art ""important"" in the 20th century. For example, there is NO entry for Saul Steinberg, whose work is probably one of the most recognizable of 20th century artists. Buy the book if your interest is a taste of what's out there. The book cannot be relied on as an objective and general, professional reference."
5,its fantasticallybrilliant,i like the book a lot it has nice pictures in it. My favouurite bit is the page on Lithctenstien because the colours are nice. I like the dotty bits as well. My mummy says that it helps me with my art when i draw pictures at school. i tryed to draw my muummy in dots and it looks really good. thankyou amazon because you have helped me and i had a lot of fun looking at the biook.
1,COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME! WATCH THE ORIGINAL!,"Why did I do it? I knew this movie couldn't be any good and yet I had to watch it! Like a train wreck, this film destroys what was good about the original. It's a slick looking movie and it is short so, I guess if you don't compare it to the original you might be able to get through it's 1 hour and 20 minute time length. It's filled with stupity from begining to end. If you want to watch 'The Hitcher' watch the original! 1 1/2 stars?"
2,"Tea: If I knew then what I know now, I'd pass on this one","If you have already seen the original movie from 1986, not the remake which is this movie, you'll probably be watching this flick with a preconceived notion of how the movie is gonna go. And you would be pretty much wrong...all around.If you haven't ever seen the original movie, then this movie might be okay for you. Might even get a little suspense out of it...might even enjoy it.Those of us that have seen the original, and thought it was brilliant, are going to be sorely disappointed in this factory version..yet another example of the Hollywood machine's constant need to remake a great movie. And it wasn't the actors, either. I'd find fault in the studio, executive producer, and the producers. I'm all for updating a movie, if you're going to make it better. I just wasn't feeling that on this one."
3,ok,"The movie was a typical attempt at a suspense thriller. Overall, it was predictable and lacking in character substance, and I found myself more angry at the heroines for their stupid decisions then anything else. That being said I found the movie entertaining. The plot and the actors were all decent and it did not try to rely strictly on the gore factor (although, there was a good amount of it involved)."
4,Not a bad remake,"This is the remake of the 1980's movie by the same name that originally starred Rutger Hauer as the Hitcher. While I do like the original a bit more, this one is not bad at all. I don't understand everyone hating this one so much. Bean makes a good bad guy although he lacks the subtle undercurrent of menace and lunacy that Hauer was able to convey. Beard is more up front in his deviancy. This one features two protagonists instead of one and the ending is changed a bit. The other classic scenes are intact such as the first pick up, the stationwagon family, and the diner, with some variations from the original in most of these scenes. The two young people are likeable and believable although they don't make very good decisions! This really is not a bad flick, do get it!"
3,this isnt so bad,i enjoyed this remake. i dont know why people are overreacting that this movie sucks cause it doesnt.this movie entertained me although not as scary as the original.i enjoyed and i will own this movie when it arrives on dvd.at least its better than stupid black christmas more powerful than texas chainsaw massacre the beginning.more suspenseful than turistas.even though its shorter than the original.the hitcher 2007 actually it was made in 2006 is a good decent flick and Sean Bean is a great actor.Hopefully someday he will be an A-list actor.He knows his stuff and he was so spectacular to watch in GOLDENEYE.
2,Nothing to it 4/10,This movie really has no value to me cause all this was is everything is just about the same as the 86 movie except there's gore the Hitcher didn't have a lot of blood & it's 2 people just 1 guy on his own is what made the Hitcher work. I guess they were trying be like Joy Ride It worked for that movie Hitcher is way different. Oh the girl survives there isn't much different. I want to say hey this movie is an ok way to pass 2 hours but I don't really care for this movie. So just being a exact copy just makes this pointless to make & a waste of money. If it was made for money it didn't make a whole lot it flopped & left theaters quickly. I didn't like Bean's John Ryder he is a very good actor but it's not a great performance. Neal McDonugh is a joke not a good actor. I'd just watch the 1986 Hitcher.
3,Sean Bean,"The only reason I watched and wanted this film is because of Sean Bean...I don't know why I like him, but I just think he is a fabulous actor...THE ORIGINAL RULESS!!!!"
3,Sean Bean Needs More Screen Time,"Having been preemptively tainted by the original performance of the 1986 version with Rutger Hauer (in a good way, Hauer was magnificent), I wasn't expecting much more other than the hope of ""greater gore,"" which this flick definitely delivered on, especially with a ""side-splitting"" scene that I was happy to use my slow-frame on. Sean Bean definitely needed more screen time, much like the Australian-based thriller ""Wolf Creek"" managed to provide for their villain. If you're a fan of watching thriller / gore flicks for the fun of it than you will definitely enjoy yourself."
1,Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Stop Remaking Movies Now,"I'm sorry about using Dr. Seuss paraphrases here but really, PLEASE don't remake good old movies and trash them like this. Not worth the time I wasted watching this ""updated"" like cinematic treat(more like gum on your shoe. The worst!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,THIS REMAKE SUCKS!,"As with a few other films, The Hitcher did not need a stinkin remake. This new version is total garbage in acting, cinematography, and everything else. Just as much an insult to the 1986 masterpiece as the crappy sequel Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting. Ignore this crappy film, stick with the original. Good day."
5,Intense Thriller,This is one of the better thriller movies I have seen. The mix of suspense and violence is just right and will keep you watching until the end.
2,For Just a Penny Less...,"...you could get the original HITCHER and watch a much better movie. I have to confess: I'm a big fan of the original HITCHER, it was scary, breathlessly suspenseful, and even made you think. This pointless remake has none of those attributes. For one thing, changing the lone driver in the original to a cloyingly cute young couple in the remake is a disastrous decision. The original, with its lone protagonist driving cross-country across dark and rainy wide open spaces, was very likable and more to the point, terribly vulnerable. By changing the story to a couple going somewhere for spring break, you automatically undercut the tension greatly because you have TWO people who can turn to each other. This is the first in a series of bad choices made by the filmmakers. Please buy the original...it's just that: ORIGINAL. And it's a good movie, unlike this derivative ripoff."
2,another pathetic remake,"hollywood is glad to have those who are told to go ''into it not expecting much''.if one needs to dumb themselves down to the iq level of a coroded sponge,that should be a great indicator of the garbage being passed off as a movie.this is as bad/good as that psycho ''remake''.the self lobotomized love it,those with at least a brain cell hate it.pick a group and go nuts.bean is the only reason this got 2 stars.want to check out a great remake,get j carpenters ''the thing''.in closing,rob zombie is redoing halloween.....YAWN"
3,To Compare,"I think if you are a huge fan of the original cult classic you are going to hate this picture no matter what. I think you need to look at this picture on its' own to appreciate it a little. As a modern thriller it is not bad. It isn't great by any stretch of the imagination, but for a mindless little romp it is okay. Sean Bean is good in his role, both charming and menacing. The kids were just okay. I think having 2 people instead of 1 takes away a bit of the scares. There is no nudity and just a bit of gore. A few head shots, a slit throat and the famous chained to a truck scene. Overall this is a decent film with some flaws. If you are one of those people that just hate the idea of remakes and won't give it a chance, then don't bother. For the rest this is a decent rental on a lazy Sunday."
2,Typical Silly Crap Teenagers Will Love.......,"......but for someone with any taste or appreciation of at least decent movie making, this is laughable. Full of tire screeches on dirt, silly conversation, and braindead policemen, it's got all the ingredients of keep the herds happy for an hour and a half. I barely kept my interest in it up until the point where the car falls off a cliff and misses Sophia by like a foot. Really! Gimme a break, man. I know credibility gets stretched in these types of films, but my eyes rolled up into my skull at that point and returned there several times until this mess mercifully ended. One star for the top half of Sophia Bush and one for her bottom half. That young woman is Gorgeous! And that's what kept me tuned in to the end. Period."
5,So pretty!!,This watch is soooo pretty. It isnt as thin as it looks in the picture and I was glad of that. Beautiful and bling-a-licious!
1,Disappointed,The watch is beautiful but the stone fell out of the center and the people (Amazon store front) would not replace it. I would have been better off buying this in a store.
5,good services,overall good product and services was exactly what was expected item well represented by its description. happy with my purchase
4,i get compliments everytime!,this watch is almost a piece of jewelry. all u have to do it put it on and u instantly look all dressed up and fancy. every time i wear it peolpe compliment me on it. ive had it for 3 years now. the only bad thing about it is that a couple of its crystals fell out. u cant tell unless u look very closely. i think they fell out after 2 years. but i still wear it and the crystals are still as clear as ever (wouldnt expect less from the swarovski crystals they use)
3,DKNY Crystal watch,2nd time I bought this watch for my girlfriend cause she likes it a lot. Also this one started losing parts of Crystal after 6 months of use. If you notice that you can use a better glue than DKNY does but if not...well.then she will ask for a new one...again...cause it still looks nice.
2,Boring and unmoving,"This is the most pointless TPB ever written. Unfortunetly, if you own Death of Superman and Return of Superman, you need this to bridge the gap. A bummer, seeing as how stupid it is."
2,I don't hate it but I don't love it,"I don't hate this TPB but let's face it...Nothing happens! It drags on and on and on and I'm like, ""something happen already!"". Every other thought bubble is reminding us that superman is dead...I know he's dead!In the beginning it was emotional and was sad but after a while, Superman's death becomes annoying. They should have shorted the story by half.I'm not saying don't read it because first of all, it's a classic so you much read it if you are a Superman fan.Second, it's goes between Death of Superman and Return of Superman so it's a must read.It will be a good read for about 50 or so pages but after that it becomes a necessary evil that you must get through.I'm not sure why it got so many good ratings. I guess because it's a classic and a staple in Superman history but story wise it's very boring. Though, I still recommend reading it if you're a hard Superman fan...if not then you can skip this one."
4,World without Superman,The saddest book of the trilogy. How the world deals with the death of the greatest heroe. As sad as it can get.
4,A fine set of original historical articles,"The original Libby paper on carbon 14 dating in in this book.There was a ""Hoax"" mentioned that I had never heard of in California in 1886.R. A. Dart's paper on the South African/ Taungs discovery is nearly unreadable for his use of terms and language.For me some of the sedimentation diagrams were very good.I enjoyed this book which showed how hard it isto get a paradigm shift in Science."
5,The Accidental Hero,"I was prepared not to like this film, but was surprised at how emotional the story is. Basically it is about a teen age boy who is in need of love and understanding. His mother has not given him the love that he needs and so he does bad things to get her attention. Apparently the young man is a loner and has no friends. Then there is the accident and the mother loses her memory. The boy's struggle to get his mother to regain her memory is very moving and shows how strong his love is for his mother. Plus he gains some insights in how to relate with other people. It is not hard to believe in this story. I recommend this movie very highly."
3,Misleading Product Description,"Item is right. However, the product description clearly states that the sale is for 3 of the filters. I only received a single filter. If you read other reviews, they seem to be unclear as to how many filters are included in the sale."
1,Poor Supplier,"If the product is out of stock,let the customer know? Makes me question Amazons service.Why would you ship half a order.VERY STUPID????"
5,hepa filters,The kenmore hepa filters were perfect....we could not have asked for a better transaction! Thank you!
2,Not like original filter,"I have purchased filters for this vacuum on line before and have been successful at finding a comparable filter. This filter is the proper size, but does not have the fine mesh on one side which helps filter out the dust better. I will not be purchasing this type again."
1,Caution,"I ordered the correct part, however was sent the incorrect item, this filter is too small, buyers beware. Also for the cost, its not worth returning it for the correct size, I ended up spending more for the part, by buying the correct part at Sears so the final cost adding this product to the mix was $26 for a paper filter.. pretty pathetic"
5,Does the job.,5-stars=Does it just like Sears' own without the higher cost.Mission accomplished.Seems to seal well and is as good as the store bought ones.
4,"Work Well, Last a Full Year","Even if you have pets, this filter will not get gummed up after a full year's use. They do help reduce the dander and other bad stuff exiting the exhaust of the vacuum but it's not 100% ""clean air"". I used to think that HEPA meant the air coming out the back of the vacuum would be like ""purified air"" but that's not the case. Like a good furnace filter it just catches more of the bad stuff; enough that you'll notice a difference.The main thing is to change your bag (maybe use HEPA bags too) often enough that you don't have to worry about the filter. They say you should change it once I year I believe, and that's probably reasonable if you've got a couple pets. For those without, I wager these things easily last 18 months unless you live in a really dusty home / very high pollen / mold count type area."
4,Kenmore HEPA Filter for Canisters KENMORE part #86880 - 2 pkgs of 1 ea,"Ordered on September 7, 2012 and received on September 13. Pleased with the quality of the order but received only 1 filter. The ad says Kenmore HEPA Filter for Canisters KENMORE part #86880 - 2 pkgs of 1 ea. I see that others have received two filters in their order. Other than misleading stating the quantity of item, I am pleased. S--rs in my town wants $14.99 for one."
4,"It fits, it works","The only minus is the ambiguity of the little arrow showing which side goes down. Do the words ""air flow"" mean the origin of the air flow or the direction of the air flow? After a Web search on this question, we installed it with the arrow pointing up (toward the cover). All good so far."
5,Cats,"This original Andrew Lloyd Webber production specifically filmed in 1998 for DVD/video is beautiful. Elaine Paige, an original London cast member, sings 'Memory'. The digital sound of a seventy piece orchestra, the dancing, costumes, and stage are done so well, I feel like I am in the front row. I bought this because I was never able to see Cats on stage. This is a beautiful keepsake that I can watch over and over. And I enjoyed the added behind the scenes production information about the making of Cats."
2,bad packaging,the suppositories do the job. nothing wrong with them. but they are packed in this foil like wrapper that tears every time u try to get a suppository out. so i have to use scissors to unwrap one. when u have a crying kid it's quite unpleasant.
5,Columbo's Second Season,"If you like Peter Falk and remember the Columbo series, the second season was among the best."
1,beware,"Purchased in late October; never opened cellophane to examine DVD-cover contents, figuring it should be fine since cover was fine. Gave as Xmas gift, only to discover this ""Complete Second Season"" had Two-Each ""Disks 3&4"", and No ""Disks 1&2"". After checking online immediately after, I discovered it was too late to exchange. My Tough Luck I Guess; too bad for me. If I could rate this one a Zero, or a J-factor of -1, I would."
5,Columbo third season,"Come in great time. Love the movies. Was received not damage. Before buying the first season I watched Columbo on TV, but has not been on for a long time. Thats why I decided to buy DVD so I can watch anytime."
5,Columbo - The Complete Second Season,"My husband and I enjoyed ""Columbo"" many years ago when it was originally on television. Therefore we were especially pleased when we discovered it is now available on dvds. It continues to be a favorite entertainment. Columbo's talents for solving the ""unsolvable"" are still relevant today. We are ""seasoned"" citizens and prefer most of our entertainment at home. Thank you for making these classic programs available."
4,aaaah - just one more question!,It's allways fun to watch the guest stars and try to figure out who did it on columbo.
3,Columbo review,"Good product, in good shape. I was disappointed there were only 4 episodes - that was the complete 2nd season?"
5,Keep them coming...,"The series is brilliant, falk is a joy to watch in action!A genious as columbo, a subtle giant as an actor,who portrays convincingly, one of the funnier antiheroes ever conceived. Season two contains some classic episodes with some fine co stars and clever plot.I fully endorse the praise of all the fans who allready own the first two boxsets like myself. I only have this to say: When is season three due for release? i can't wait!"
3,A Columbo fan must dissent,"I loved the Columbo series. This was one of the smartest running shows on television and I had only wished they would have made more. The deductive and inductive reasoning in almost all episodes is a perfect way to teach social science methodology, which I do. However, this episode is a bit disappointing. I know that saying so is somewhat sacrilege because it was the first of the NBC episodes and directed by Speilberg. However, there is substantially less Columbo in this Columbo than almost any other episode. Jack Cassidy is the real focus. And Columbo's victory over Cassidy's character is not arrived at in the usual deductive method. There is much more induction and luck here. After this episode, the writers allowed for more step-by-step logic, thereby giving Falk's acting skills a chance to shine."
5,"columbo, the greatest","to me, columbo has always been the only detective show that I liked. in his apparent absent minded way he could solve any case. If you have never seen one of his shows, do it now. thru amazon you can get all seven complete seasons....don't delay!"
4,USER FRIENDLY,"we're not so young anymore, so we tend to seek the shade. Big bulky umbrella sets are not so easy to find, rent or set up. This liitle chair does it all. It is easy to carry; setup is a breeze; and the umbrella does its job even under breezy conditions. my only concern is that the umbrella ""whip-like' ARMITURE tends to rust pretty quickly. My plan is to steel wool it and put a little lubricant on it before our next trip. I definitely recommend this chair. Oh, lets not forget the attachments. The litte cooler is just the thing for our ""SUMMER DRINKS"" on the beach."
4,Great Brits,"Thank God for the Brits. Outside of select USA bands, such as the Foo Fighters, the mantle of Rock is basically being kept alive by England. Doves, Snow Patrol, Embrace, Doves, and others, are producing greatrock, while we are dominated by Hip Hop -which produces some great stuff, but a lot of self righteous and repetitive pap. This collection, especially CDs 3&4, documents music that was only peripherally familiar to me while it was being made. It shows that ever since the Beatles hit our shores, the Old World has kept a steady stream of great music coming our way, even when we try to ignore it."
5,Brit Pop with a bite,"In the United State when one thinks of ""Brit Pop"", the Sixties british invasion comes to mind. However, in the mid-eighties up until the late ninties- Brit Pop scrapped together punk, synth, and romantic new wave rock with a twist of sixties psychedelic rock to make the music danceable. In the U.S. groups like Ned's Atomic Dustbin, and Cornershop had songs that were popular with college music stations. In a sense you might say that this collection is a ""part II"" to Rhino's ""Left of the Dial."" Some of this music still exists today, except it is under the ""Nu Rave"" name."
2,Incredibly Mediocre!,"I would probably give this compilation more like 1.5 stars, except that would disrespect the few good tracks (MBV, Spiritualized, Teenage Fanclub, Lush, etc.) scattered amongst the piles of mediocrity on this compilation. Take the best tracks and you would have a very strong, if unadventurous, single disc compilation. This four disc comp, however, is bloated with middling bands that don't even rise to the status of one hit wonders. I'm deeply puzzled by the warm reception this compilation has received in the other reviews.If you want to hear a true collection of great British pop, check out the Rough Trade Indie Pop collection:http://www.amazon.com/Rough-Trade-Shops-Indiepop-Vol/product-reviews/B0002SF76M/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=1"
3,missing bands,"include :strangelove,puressence,shed seven,house of love, molly half head(who?),idlewild,levitation(see house of love ).and if your going to have bands like the dylans why not the milltown brothers.also,where is doves ? they released music in the late 90's. but enough about the nitpicking because if a collection has bands like the family cat and thousand yard stare it gets points for trying."
4,Incomplete survey,"Tis a shame that a millennium-spanning music collection doesn't include such Britpop classics as ""Sumer is icumen in"" and ""Greensleeves"", to name but two. True indie songs, they avoided the major labels for most of that period, and stayed high on the oral-trad charts."
3,""" A Question of Trust ""","This book is about a boy named Brad and his younger brother Charlie. His mom and dad are separated. When Brad and Charlie fnd a stray cat in their shed it has kittens. They have to be responsible enough to keep the kitten alive. Tuexedo hte black and white kitten is found dead and they blame Cat. So they have to deciced to tell their dad about the cats and trust them, or not?"
1,Don't waste your money,"The concept is nice but unfortunately it does not work. As soon as you squeeze the bottle, the bubbles pour out of the top. The wand never seemed to catch the bubble fluid, so I kept blowing, dipping, spilling, blowing, dipping, etc. and no bubbles! I blew so much that I got dizzy. Finally threw it away."
1,"ordered twice, got dora both times instead of spongebob","we ordered these no-spill mini bubble tumblers for a birthday party with a spongebob theme. we were shipped dora instead of spongebob. we exchanged the product, and got dora again. we had to return the product for refund. amazon handled the exchanges and refund great, but we ran out of time to find this product in the spongebob version and had to find alternative gifts for our guests... inconvenient."
5,"i.v. drugs. how to mix, what is compatible","This paper back book is one of the most useful books I have ever found. It is helpful to pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurses and others whoneed to know exactly how to mix i.v. drugs at a standard concentration. It is easy to read and understand. I highly recommend it if you work in a hospital setting"
2,Poor container for blocks,Please be careful when buying this toy. The yellow handle and red box to store the blocks in is not designed very well and little children (and adults) can pinch their fingers when pushing the handle upright. The red box also has sharp corners. Not a good design (my husband regularly puts it out of our 11-month-old's reach.) I'm just going to throw it out.
5,Circus Peek A Blocks,"These Fisher Price Peek-A-Blocks are fun to play with and comes with a handy carry tray to store them in. Great for a young child who loves to stack and knock them over. Cute designs inside in a variety of circus theme, They are also interchangable with other Fisher Price Peek-A-Block toys."
3,Wasn't that impressed,"I like the Peek-a-blocks in general, but not this specific theme. I thought that the blocks were pretty boring. I didn't like manually turning the wheel on some to make the inside spin. Some of the other types of peek-a-blocks are more exciting. The ""Big Top"" storage unit was useless. I didn't really see much value in it except to store them in, which the toy box does just fine. Especially since we own more peek-a-blocks than the 9 that came with it.As far a safety goes, I didn't have a problem with it. If my child fell face first on any toy, it is bound to hurt them, so I didn't find these to be dangerous."
5,Traumatic Stress,The authors display an intimate knowledge of their subject. It is an invaluable contribution to the field of mental health. I highly recommend this book to all who have an interest in trauma stress studies.Mingmei Jiang BVocEd&Train;(C.Sturt)
3,Great Learning Book for interested kids,"I bought this for my 8 year old son, it's educational while still being in the realm of something that would interest him."
2,not as pictured,The costume is cute but the hat is nothing what it looks like on the picture. It is a velvet looking hat and my little girl was very disappointed when she received the costume.
1,WARNING! DO NOT BUY! The thing is absolute junk!,"Had issues with the speakers not working right away, and just after the limited warranty ran out after a year, it began to blink on and off, over & over & over. Customer service was useless. Repair would have been $150 so I just bought a better brand. Avoid any Princeton brand product."
1,"Poorly made air bed, don't buy!",The craftsmanship of this bed is terrible. My fisrt one leaked at the heat sealed seams after using three times. They replaced with new one and after one use it started leaking in the same place. Now Wenzel will not replace the replacment! Poor customer service and worse product. I would NEVER buy another one.
5,Really great!,I have been wanting this anime for a long time now after I watched the first 3 episodes on the Anime Network and everywhere else wanted $50 or more for this and I ended up getting it cheaper here. Only flaw is that it took forever to get! It was going on two months but after talking to Amazon they ended up pushing it up to a faster shipping and I ended up getting it. Another thing is that in the English dub version you don't hear Shion's mom talking to him in the first episode when he is talking to her threw the intercom. But I watch it more in Japanese so that was fine with me. ^^This is really an amazing anime and after watching this I ended up getting the books that it was all based on.In the end I was so glad I ended up buying this threw Amazon and not somewhere else. XD Now if I can only transfer it to my Kindle!
1,Sentai needs to step it up...,"The series itself was mediocre at best, my biggest complaint is Sentai Filmworks' ability to make and sell their products. The dub is poorly done, It's not that the voice actors that are bad, it's just that there where multiple times that the voice wouldn't align with the mouth movements (voices would be heard and the character's mouth was either not moving yet or had already stopped moving) It's not even just this, the DVD menu is boring with no sound, it's a still picture, and has no notable special features. With the amount you pay for a Sentai anime it's unacceptable to receive a product that seems like little to no effort was put into it."
3,"New York Times, yes: McPherson, no.","While the excerpts from the New York Times are valuable and instructive in themselves, this book is disappointing for what it does not have--any valuable input from McPherson. He adds about one paragraph at the beginning of each chapter, information summing up the war at that period, available in any encyclopedia. The Times text is totally un-annotated. There are no notes to identify individuals mentioned in the reports or the reporters who sometimes left their initials at the end of their text. Anyone interested in how the war was covered is left searching other sources for information."
2,"Delcious yes, healthy, nooooo....","No trans fat Yea!No MSG Yea!6g protein Yea!46g of carbs hmmmmmm.... well it is noodles...1290mg of NaCl.....ouch!!I just had half a bowl, my daughter couldn't finish it. I forgot to check the salt content before I bought a 6 pack @ Costco. One bowl is 2 servings. Each serving contains 1290 mg (1.29g) of salt. Enough to make your own small ocean (OK I exxagerate). The recommended max salt intake per human per diem is about 2.3g. Surely the flavor could be saved with 1/3 the salt? I wonder if I can return it...?"
2,basic very short story,my 5 years old grand daughter reads English & French and loves books over toys but she showed very little interest for the too short story.
2,skip the book in my opinion,"The best bet you have is to read Neile McQueen's book My Husband My Friend. I'm halfway done with this book ""McQueen the Biography"" and I must say it is rehashing the story you get first hand from Steve's first wife. Overall the writer is very impressed with his own ad libbing of Steve-like phrases. It comes off reading almost like a script for a Steve McQueen bio drama movie, not a really factual biography. My advice is to skip it. Go with Neile."
3,Less is often better.,"I have been a Steve McQueen fan since watching him interact opposite Paul Newman in a couple of brief scenes in the b&w; film ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" back in the mid 50's. A year or two later he was racing up the street backward in the cult horror classic, ""The Blob"". Then came ""The Great Escape"", ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Bullitt"", and my personal favorite, ""LeMans"".Through it all McQueen remained the coolest cat in town. Watching Steve McQueen is a lesson in 'economical' acting - less is always better.Unfortunately the same is true about the man himself. The less I know about Steve McQueen, the better I like it. I don't want to know he was petty and insecure. That he wasted years of his life brooding over some imagined insults. If you like your Steve McQueen with warts and all, this is the book for you. I prefer to remember him fondly as the 'every man' he so elequently portrayed on film."
2,When a journalist exploits a movie star,"Blatant exploitation of a movie star by a journalist. I don't know what else to write besides that.I've given it two stars because it has some good lines in it. How accurate the research is, I wouldn't know. But Steve McQueen would be rolling in his grave."
3,"An Interesting Life, but...","I found the first few chapters of this book really holdling my attention, but as his career became more solid it all seemed less interesting. I guess it's the early McQueen that is most enjoyable to read about - the way he establishd his ""cool"" and muscled his way through the film industry to become a major star. The aging of the actor and his diminishing roles and vigor caused me to lose interest and simply didn't feel like finishing it."
3,A Good Beginning Programming Book,This book is a good beginning programming book. The author lays out the structure of the language and programming in general very nicely. The price is right because I think you get a full copy of Delphi 4 Standard Edition for no charge! I spent a whole half hour skimming through this book. I've programmed in Turbo Pascal after learning a little dos basic. Pascal is the best language to learn programming with. It protects you from mistakes and teaches structured programming. From there you can learn any other language much easier. The book is a must for the beginner or a person that would like to review the language. I was disappointed that their were no Delphi sections that I could see.
3,not too bad,"I ordered two DTV3X4 but received two 4X4. Should work fine, correct? I installed one about three weeks ago and it went bad already.Had to install another brand so I would not have to take more time while patrons waited. Hope the next one will work better."
3,Not what I expected,"This unit is very probably excellent, as I have purchased the 4x8 and it works very well. The only problem with this one is in it's application. I assumed that I could use two of the four outputs from my satellite dish to allow me to run two PVRs, unfortunately it does not work that way so I called the manufacturer. They informed me I had to use ALL satellite outputs if there were four, two would only work if my dish only had two. There was no mention of this fact in the information on line. It sits unused at this time."
3,Maybe the don't work on cascade,"Did not work for my directv setup, lots of channel lose the signal... Since I live in a building I'm not sure if there's another one on the roof... Maybe 2 multiswitch on cascade don't work..."
4,Denensions,Looks like a great desk but I am wondering why most of the demensions listed online are for the two lengths of the desk and the hight. What happended to the depth? I have found a few desks listing the depth but not too many and there are a lot of differences between the depth on desks. I am looking fo rone that has depth of aroung 30+
4,don't forget to wet weekly!,good product but don't forget to rewet the pillow b/c itwill quickly turn brown & get dry in the middle.
2,terrible video quality,This unit has poor video quality an is not HDTV quality. The one plus is the signal strength meter which is more sensitive than the other model which enables you to aim your antenna properly.
1,"Good price, picture not good enough","Forget about this! Buy the TV with tuner built in!!!I tried this with my new HD Monitor, Picture is not good, I returned both the TV and the Tuner and get one built in, which works much better!"
4,best album title ever!,"But don't let the title and lines like ""When the Dope ran out so did she"" fool you. Mulehead is no novelty act. Sure they like to have fun with their music but beneath all the clever word play and upbeat songs lives a band of remarkable skill and a deep understanding of the traditions of country music. If you've always had the feeling you like country music but what you hear on regular radio makes you cringe, then Mulehead is the thing for you."
4,Beautiful but creepy,This is a great performance but it is so creepy to know it was recorded as experimental stereo years before home audio was offered in stereo. Even creepier considering the recording was made during a WWII air raid. You can hear the muffled bombs and return fire.
1,Should be burned,"I cannot believe Passport Entertainment's artistic ineptness! Nor can I believe the positive review.''The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made'' does not have that good of selections, either, but at least they give a little scope on each of the films listed and make the film comprehensible. Here they just show a bunch of trailers for movies. Movies are missing from the list while others have absolutely no place. It's not even worth calling them the ''Film Critics'' 's list if we can't know who selected each of the films. Passport must have selected them and tried to pass off their selections as the critics'.Stick with ''The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made;'' all copies of ""Film Critics: Top 100 Films of All Time'' should be burned."
2,What Film Critics???????,This is a totally bogus DVD. They don't anywhere explain who are the critics that voted for the movies. Any idiot could pick most of these movies. It's basically the AFI list. It's stupid.
2,Really disappointing,"I did not care for this DVD set at all. The list itself accounts for less than an hour of the running time. They spend less than 30 seconds on each film, and a good portion of that time is spent on the numbers between the screen. The commentator has no special insight and mostly recites well-known facts about each film.As for the films themselves, the selection is good. The list mirrors AFI closely, except they completely ignore ""Schindler's List"" (AFI #9). In its place in the top 10 is ""A Beautiful Mind"", which I loved but am a little wary about putting it that high. They also bypass ""The Third Man"" and put in ""The Matrix"" around its position. I am very doubtful that this is by critics' consensus.There are a good number of trailers, which stops this DVD from being a complete waste. In fact, that's about the only reason I could think of to buy. Just a few things to keep in mind if you're considering buying this."
1,Stinker.,"I can't even remember what this movie was about. That's how boring it must have been. The only reason I rented it was because of all the recommendation from various film festivals. Boy, did they get it wrong, wrong. wrong."
4,Make Lemonade,I thought it was a great story. I wish there was a little more detail into what and who inspired you along the path of poetry. Congrats on all of your hard work. You are truly inspirational.
4,"BRIEF, BUT INTERESTING","If your young child likes squirrels, he/she should enjoy this. It is interesting and informative."
3,"entertaining writing, but little unique to this book","This book is a collection of Krassner's writings for <EM>High Times</EM>, the <EM>New York Press</EM>, and <EM>AVN Online</EM>, along with a few others. I've read a lot of Krassner's work, and there was a lot here that was quite familiar--many of the stories are ones he has told elsewhere. If you've already read his autobiography, <EM>Confessions of a Raving, Unconfined Nut</EM>; his <EM>Murder at the Conspiracy Convention</EM> and <EM>Sex, Drugs, and the Twinkie Murders</EM>, there will only be a little that's new here.The book is unfortunately poorly edited, with numerous uncorrected typos which should have been spotted even by automated spellchecking."
2,"""Policy Lite""","The 4th edition of this text was a truly outstanding edition. It fit the needs of a wider vairety of courses ranging from the traditional Ag Policy course to courses focusing on the environment and rual development. Unfotunately, this is 5th edtion. If the reader wants a ""CLiff-Notes"" version then this is the text. It lacks the depth and breadth of a decent college textbook. The authors would have served the academic community much better by giving this watered down fifth edition a totally new title while leaving the 4th edition in print.I have taught Agricultural Policy for a number of years. Count me out on adopting this edition."
2,Ag Policy W/O Economic Analysis,"I used earlier editions of this book extensively to teach senior level agricultural policy. I stopped assigning the book when the 5th edition was published. Most graphical economic analysis had been removed from the book. It supposedly was now geared toward ""policy makers"" rather than university students. If you want a decent textbook, go for the older editions and update the data as needed."
3,My liver loved them,"A bar that makes it a little less challenging to grab a chemical-free way to snack conveniently is somehting I can appreciate. I like that the bar is nutrient-dense, bursting with taste from simple, wholesome ingredients. The macadamia nuts are most prominent here, and are even sometimes found nearly whole. Though, for however good these bars promise to be, I don't see myself purchasing them again soon. Admittedly, I do miss the melt-in-your-mouth sensation of some kind of silky sweet (yogurt or chocolate) coating, and I did get a little impatient with the delicate bar's tendency to crumble. Plus, a couple of bars in my batch lost their freshness because--by some manufacturing glitch--they weren't sealed at one end of the wrapper (straight out of an unopened box)."
5,love these bars,"These are great bars to eat.I love the combination of nuts and apricot. Don't know how the manage to make it into a bar without it breaking apart into little bits.Three flavors and this is one of my favorites. The yogurt one is good but at the bottom of the list.Great price too for a bar like this and a good choice when you've done Power bars, Cliff bars, etc..."
1,Amount of fat,"Am extremely disappointed especially as to the amount of fat in each bar. Would never have ordered these if this had been specified on web page. Here I have 2 boxes and can not use. Please start listing amounts of fat, sodium, etc. on each bar."
2,seemed stale,"I love the ingredients that are in these bars,but they seem to be on the verge of being rancid.I would hesitate to order these again,was a bit dissappointed."
1,Puffed,"Gross! These are mainly puffed rice with some cardboard flavoring added in. Apricots, Macadamian nuts, and Brazil nuts have a very fleeting appearance on your tongue but it is quickly slammed with cardboard and flavorless puffed rice."
1,It does not work,This was sent to me. IT DOES NOT WORK in an Aspire 5610-4610 and the claim is made that it does. NO WHERE is BATCL50L on the battery or the box. The box it came in has BL-5123 on the outside.Cannot charge it since the charger (TWO chargers as a matter of fact) cut on and off due to overload of the charger ........
4,I love this bag!,"I purchased this bag to be my primary diaper bag for my 2nd baby - it's far more stylish and ""me"" than the one I had for my first. The quality is fantastic; durable stitching, sturdy fabrics. I expect this one will last for years. The only drawback is that it's just not quite big enough for the 'stuff' I need for my newborn, especially if we're going to be out for more than just a few hours. Bottom line: the bag is great if you don't have to pack a lot of supplies. I would definitely buy another one."
3,"Good Overview, Though Dated on Technology","This book gives a good overview of different teaching techniques based on technology. However, many of the key references are from the 80s and 90s, which dates a lot of material. Technology is clearly moving faster than the educational researchers can keep up. It's really up to the teachers to keep on their feet and come up with their own creative ways of applying technology in their own classrooms. This book can serve as a catalyst to some ideas, but it's not the end all in that regard."
4,Awesome book,This book will be used as a text book for a class that I was taking online on the Master's level. This book outlines how technology plays a part in teaching students in the classroom. It gives insight on how to use the technology and how to teach students how to use it as well. Great text book.
3,You can find better...keep looking!,"Not that helpful. Very confusing when explaining some information and way overly detailed when explaining other information. There are better resources out there. The class I used this for was very helpful, but the book itself did not teach me anything new. Other books that are more hands on and have you try the things they are talking would be a better buy."
2,Modern Irish Cooking,"I didn't particularly like this book, I'm more into traditional cooking and these recipes were a little too trendy/nouveau for my preferences. I think if you are interested in non-traditional Irish cooking you would probably enjoy this book."
1,BEWARE!,"This movie advertises itself as being 84 minutes long on its packaging, when in fact it is not even the full 78 minute version, but another of the many different packagings of the 60 minute edited version.This version did do a good job of lightening up some of the more darkly lit scenes of this old classic, but it cannot be recommended because its missing 18 minutes of footage and advertising itself as having 24 more minutes that it actually contains."
4,Fast-paced and gripping,"I'm puzzled by the reviewer who called this book ""cute"" and the spiritual warfare aspect ""amateurish."" I found the book impossible to put down and actually liked it even better than its predecessor, ""The Invitation."" Nancy Moser effectively brings home the reality of evil in the world. The scenes in which the villain, Bo Tenebri, begins to show his true colors are chilling. In my opinion, this book deserves a place right up there on the shelf with the best of Frank Peretti's spiritual warfare classics."
2,Ecofix,"I had previously bought the algae fix from the same company, but because of reading the review about this product thought to try it. My pond turned dark and murky within 2 weeks and never went back to the clarity it had with the original product. I was especially disappointed because I had just drained and cleaned the pond prior to this. I will be going back to the other product. Unfortunately, I had bought 2 gallons."
5,Great Pond Stuff!,This stuff works great! It cleans up your pond fast and helps keep it clean! You must try this in your pond!!
4,NOT WHAT IT CLAIM'S TO BE,"They have used Muddy to try to sell this one. He does one song by himself, one more with other artists this is all you see of him. But there is great stuff from the other artists, but it is still worth seeing. The other artists also are not bad, nice old b/w footage."
4,"good product, easy installation but takes lots of disk space","Installation of this scanner was a breeze under Windows 98 and I was scanning stuff in no time. I use this scanner for photographs and I am satisfied with the scans I'm getting. The one big surprise was the space required for the applications that come with the scanner--- four hundred and fifteen (415) megabytes! Disks are cheap and voluminous these days so this isn't really a big deal, but it may catch some folks who are strapped for disk space by surprise. Fair warning."
1,HP 5370C software not compatible with windows XP,"Why didn""t HP include the necessary software to install this program ( Precisionscan Pro no. 2.52. ) or at least offer it at no cost without having to download such a very large scanning program. This isn""t very good for HP consumer relations. My next scanner will be a cannon."
5,Something for everyone,"Filled with familiar songs that were popular in the '20's and decades after.Size is too small for me to play from however. I'll need to scan and print the songs I want to learn to play on 8-1/2 x 11"" pages. The book's small size makes it easy to store and carry but a potato chip bag clip is necessary to hold it open on the music rest as I preview those songs I think I want to reprint."
2,NOT a source of good sheet music,"I ordered this book expecting to get full sheet music for all the songs they list, but it's not. The book contains only themelody line, chords, and the first verse and/or refrain for the songs. It would be good if you were just trying to remember a little bit of a melody, or remembered a very old melody but not the name of the song. In that case, you could start playing little bits of each until you found the right one."
2,Taste Filling Less Great,"This book looks great and has tons of photos- it is an enjoyable collection of eye candy. Do not expect any new info from this one. The text describes what the author might imagine this time was like, instead of alowing the reader to draw their own conclusions."
2,Definitely NOT dust-free,"I was so hoping to find a litter that would track less and reduce box odor, and this litter does those things. Unfortunately, it also puts a huge amount of dust in the air each time the cat uses the box. I paid more than $25 in a local shop and I'm going to have to just throw it away after only a few days. What a waste!"
4,Best Bubble gun ever!! BUY IT!!!!,Me and my cousin loves this thing. But the only thing we hate is when we have to dip it into the cap. It comes with vapor fluid and bubble liquid. I like when the smoke comes out of the bubblesi think its realy cool. Whoever likes bubbles BUY IT!!!
1,Don't Waste Your Money,What a disappointment this product was. You have to repeatedly dip the front into bubble mix. This very expensive toy doesn't even fill with bubble solution. You might as well just buy a big bottle of bubbles and play with them the old fashioned way. Save your money.
1,heavy,"It should publish more information about the product, dimensions, weight. It is necessary to know as accessories associated with this safety pin.Pedro Pazo"
2,A cute but ultra-simple book bordering on boring.,"As with Rosemary Wells' other books, this one is charmingly illustrated. The bear who wants to go over the mountain is terribly cute, especially as he says goodbye to his mama before departing. However, the book is so simple that it didn't engage my 2-year-old, who loves the many other Wells books we have. The repetitive song essentially has just three lines. And, unlike other Wells books, the illustrations don't vary that much from page to page. The ""Read to Your Bunny"" book that kicked off this series was much more engaging, providing pleasant word and picture variations on a theme."
3,Good Cute Book,"I really like this book and so does my daughter. I was a little disappointed in the quality of the book itself. It was not ""like new"" condition."
1,Laughter is the best medicine,"This book is a JOKE. I was so excited to read this debut from our local physician, and was terribly disappointed that I wasted a whole day trying to find the darn thing in town. This book has had me in stitches the entire time. It is comical - the tone and the language that is used...it sounds like a bad joke on SNL. Not to mention the characters that are just like recent movie characters, but only by ""coincidence"" of course. This is something that should have remained a manuscript in the good doctors desk."
5,Something of the Ancients,"Having read the first two of Hammond's books, I had to have this one too and it didn't fail to disappoint, to say the least.I think A Touch of Strange is my favourite of all three of this real-life west-coast trilogy. It's grittier than the others and there are even more great characters -many old ones but several new ones too- than in the other two books combined, which I was not expecting.There is high humor and fairly gruesome tragedy, as well as some almost epically poetic moments.Something of the ancient Greeks and Romans here, or perhaps closer to a Viking bard?"
4,"Item works, but picture isn't very helpful","The power strip I received looks a little different than the one pictured. The picture doesn't even show the whole thing but I can still tell. Maybe the model has been updated? In any case, I did not realize the cord comes out of the front face (the side with outlets). I was expecting/hoping it to come out of one end, as most other power strips seem to do. The included mounting hardware is a nice touch, but I've yet to try it out. Overall it seems to work but it's not exactly what I was expecting."
5,Tripp Lite PS2408 Power Strip,"Excellent quality! Sturdy metal case and 15' long cord. Built in 15A breaker/power switch. Easy mounting to a workbench or any flat surface. Made to be used in a tough environment, but affordable for the homeowner. Built to last."
3,Not as pictured.,"This is a very simple part, and not much should go wrong. However the photo indicated it was provided with screws and nuts, but the part received did not have any nuts (just the screws). If the nuts are important, then try another vendor."
3,Not Sure About The Shoes But The Sizing A Bit Small,First let me say that this review is neutral because of the fact that they didn't fit properly and were returned. I purchased these for my mother and while she has had a lot of Naturalizer shoes in the past these were a bit small in both the width and length. If you're ordering these you may want to try a size larger and make sure the shoes are being sold by Amazon or a dealer that allows for free returns if they don't fit. Props to Amazon for their easy return and quick credit after we returned these.
5,Great for Working Women,"These shoes are great for standing up all day long, high enough heel to be pretty, low enough to be comfortable. and the straps keep the shoes on my little narrow feet!"
4,Cute and fairly comfy,"These shoes are very cute. I am glad I got the wide width, it is just right... and my feet are not THAT wide. I would have given the shoe five stars if the sole was more cushiony. I wear Aerosoles a lot and so I think I'm spoiled there.All in all, a cute shoe and probably very comfy for younger women whose feet are still in pretty good shape!"
1,"good shoe, but bad seller","The shoes are not the color I ordered. I ordered Navy/Coffe, but they are brown. And one shoe looks not completely new (may be used as sample domenstration).I'm ok only because the shoe itself is comfortable. I'm quite unsatisfied with the seller since the seller seems irresponsible."
4,One hell of a read,"This book is 400 pages long. And in those 400 pages, there is enough sheer chaos in this book for three novels of this length.Slade sometimes gets a bit too verbose, but one thing you can always count on is that things will be nothing short of anarchy with his settings and plots. And while there were a few characters that really could have been left out of this book, I was absoulutely blown away by how cunning, manipulative, and relentless Evil Eye (the main villain) was in this book.Michael Slade has an amazing gift as a writer - he makes you want to root for the bad guys because they're so darn cool. This is one of those books."
3,"Far from ""his"" best","I have now read most of Slade's books, and I am so disappointed at his (their) efforts after Headhunter and Ghoul, which are the two best crime thriller novels I've ever read. Evil Eye is a fast read, very engaging, but a little candy-coated (due to the fact that ""Michael Slade"" now includes the original author's daughter instead of a criminal lawyer, as in the earlier books, I think). Still, a good read that is hard to put down."
1,Westerns at their worst,"This has to be one of the worst Westerns I have ever read. This is the sort of thing a person might write after doing tequila shots at every Western cliche while watching Tombstone with Kurt Russell, then thinking, I can make up a better hero who can out-shoot Wyett Earp, out-doctor Doc Holliday and out-gay Mr. Fabian, carries the most powerful gun in the world and can paint to boot.You can tell writers getting paid by the word when they start throwing in a lot of unnecessary words. In this book, nearly everything said is repeated 2 or 3 times. From the prologue describing the gunfight at OK Corral to the first chapter where the protagonist retells the story of the gunfight at OK corral to his gay lover (who dresses like a sailor), it is full of text or characters saying the same thing over and over again.I am going to burn my copy of the book so no one has to be subjected to it."
5,Great Vocals; Great Ukulele; Great Songs,"Janet Seidel vocals, Chuck Morgan ukulele, and David Seidel bass--trio from Australia. This CD presents great arrangements of wonderful American songs from the 20's 30's 40's, and 50's. Janet Seidel sounds sort of like Doris Day without the schmaltz. If you had any doubt that the ukulele is the best instrument for accompanying vocals your doubt will be dispelled by this CD. Mr. Morgan uses both concert and tenor ukuleles (but not both at the same time) and plays uke solo in addition to accompanying Ms. Seidel."
1,"Love this water, HATE Amazons price!!","We love this water. 10 for $10 (!) at my local grocery store!!! Are you kidding me? Highway robbery going on here. Love the water, hate the price!"
1,Not much different than water!,"I was expecting this to be more flavorful. If you are looking for just a small ""hint"" of flavor (like you filled your empty juice bottle with water, and there's that residual flavor there) - this is the product for you."
3,"Disappointing, good idea, not my thing!","I think it's just me. I'd never tried a flavored water before, other than adding a slice of lemon or lime...I thought this sounded like a good idea, I drink ALOT of water. But for some reason it just isn't my thing. It seems like it leaves a bit of an aftertaste. I will drink my CASE of it,,,,,,,but not with enthusiasm. I wouldn't want to dissuade people from trying it, since I may just be an oddball."
5,Amazing!,Perfect fit and exact replacement for 1997 Jeep Cherokee Country 4.0L. This thing is much bulkier and stronger than the original. Easy swap and now the tighter steering when turning!
2,Almost,Well its a nice bird feesder pole by Homestead but.....What is shown on the box is different then what you get. The pictures implies that there Triple Bin Party Feeder will slide right on the top of the pole well dont think that is the case. The actual end of the pole does not look anything like what is shown on the box. Oooooops
3,Easy to install hard to assemble,"This pole is hard to assemble. The pieces don't fit together very well. You have to use a rubber mallet and have some patience. However, once the thing was put together, you just jab it into the ground. I would reccommend a wooden bird feeder for easiest installation. Just put in a couple of wood screws and you're done."
5,Exactly what I needed,"The 4x8 Multiswitch was exactly what I was looking for to expand my DirecTV. I have a dual lumen dish with 4 lines coming into my house. I mounted the multiswitch on the wall next to my utility box where all the cables run, plugged it in and connected 6 lines out to my satellite boxes (2 dual line DVRs and 2 single line boxes) and all worked perfectly. I'm able to record 2 shows (or watch 1 and record another) on both DVRs and watch different things on the other TVs.It was inexpensive, easy to set up and worked perfectly."
3,Watch out,This product does not work with slimline dishes!!! You will get some channels but not all. If you have HD then you probably have a slimline dish. This is made very clear on the manufacturers website but not so much by the reseller [...] or Amazon. Go to Aspen's website for pictures of slimline dishes and how to tell them from other dishes
3,Not for 5 LNB Dish,It is my fault that I didn't read all the reviews before I bought this multiswitch. I have a 5 LNB dish and of course it did not work with the my HD channels. I returned it and bought one that did. If you have a 5 LNB dish do not buy this multiswitch! If you have anything else it would work great.
4,Multi-Switch,"The switch arrived on time. It can be be used inside or out. it doesn't come with instuctions, but most FTA forums can help with setup. It is a powered switch. I have four antenae's connected and six boxes connected. To acheive this I used two switches and a diseq at the end of each box. When connecting the antenae's to this switch only one side is 22Khz be sure to set your box up correctly. Apply power to the switch. Approx. ten minutes to complete."
1,defective,"All output ports didn't work. can't get a reply from seller,I'm out of money on this, bad buy"
2,is not like the one in the picture,"First, I got somethign not like the picture. So beware, they're not giving the real one. Second, this works only for Directv, so if you don't have Directv, stay away from it, it's useless."
3,Wrong Part - Amazon's database wasn't accurate,"Quality was OK but too bad it didn't fit my vehicle:( I know matching the right part to cars isn't always easy and parts shops get it wrong too, but with mail order it's more of a pain. Checking dimensions is hard without dismantling the front end. Please get it together Amazon."
2,Rubbish,"With a world market available, and a world labor pool available, there will be a decline in wages and standard of living in the US. Not much can change that - even protectionism and whining. Throw out the neocons that have exacerbated this mess by their love of deregulated markets. Was there a foreword to this book by George W Bush?"
5,"Contrary to Close Minded Liberal's beliefs, It is great!","This is an absolutely excellent book. Even if you are a democrat, unless you are completely close minded and ignorant, you will enjoy it. Not too politically biased, the book gives the current economic challenges of outsourcing a comical spin, and puts things in perspective. I loved it, and recommend it for anyone; regardless of whether you care a great deal about the economy, it is a funny and enlightening quick-read."
1,Nothing Ground Breaking Here,"Sorry, but this book didn't offer any true ""fixes"". It raises issues and eyebrows but we're no better off for reading it."
5,A Great Read,"This book is wonderful. At less than 200 pages, it is very easy to read and straight up to the point. It is thought provoking and very humourus. I highly recommend it to all Americans--demorcrats included!"
2,"Light on content, weak in solutions","The blame is misplaced, offered solutions are weak. Author's view:- US workers are too expensive and uneducated.- Taxes are too high.- Regulations are too strict.- Litigations prevent companies from doing business.Is there any other corporate pet peeve that he left out? So, the short version of his solution is -- lower the cost of labor in US and let companies pillage like they do in Asian markets. Great, just great!The only valid point was a problem with immigration laws. We do need to attract and retain intellect.For a different perspective read Lou Dobbs ""Exporting America""."
1,biased and short sited,"The bottome line is that if employers can pay smaller taxes and smaller salaries they will make more in profits, which makes their stock holders happier and brings the company higher profits. Outsource away. We are slowly moving toward a country of the very wealthy and the very poor. Sounds more like a right wing policy to me. Does this guy have an agenda?"
5,wonderful trip!,"Mordecai polishes his translations of Chinese poetry, moves the junk & households of other Californians, and stays on various back porches & Big Sur getaways finding love and friendship in the 1970's of our memories. Along the way, we ourselves grow to love and appreciate the joys of these marginal characters, the heirs of Steinbeck's Mack and the boys of CANNERY ROW. A magical book!"
5,Love it !,"I appreciate the innovative design that allows for all of the following in one salt shaker: small holes, large holes (for sea salt), or one large hole for pouring a larger amount of salt out of the shaker. Neat idea."
4,It Twists AND Shakes,"Great idea, and just what I was looking for--a salt shaker that lets you choose whether it's a fine shake, big shake, pouring (for recipes), or closed (in humid environments). Great product!"
5,The Importance of Conversations with our Daughters,"The Mother Daughter Circle is a gift of guidance for having the conversations we all want to have with our daughters. The stories we share will become treasures and remind us that we really do love each other so deeply even when communciation is difficult. I wish this book was available when my Mother was alive. Ms Strauss made me realize the importance of sharing our mutual experiences. I will not miss that opportunity with my daughter. The Mother Daughter Circle provides the perfect venue for having the conversations you want to have with your daughter. I also believe Mother's of daughters, young and old, can benefit from the words in Celia's book. It is not too late or too early to enjoy the connection of Mother & Daughter. I want to thank Celia Strauss for writing this so piognantly for all of us."
1,So Many Typos!,The amount of typos in this version is appalling. Do not get this version of the Meditations. I'm only in Section 1 and it is unbearable to read.
1,"Right bag, wrong connector",Received one HD-15 connector rather than the DB-9 that I ordered. They do look rather similar (15 Pins rather than 9 Pins). I am getting a refund and sending it back. I see there is another review recently with the same issue.
5,Gender Changer,I use so many different cables and connectors that I never seem to have the correct gender cable and this solves many problems. It works well.
4,good,"Good record, good sound, fun to dance too, my grandson liked it ok,polka polka polka i really have nothing more to say"
2,Battery did not fit computer,"This was the second aftermarket battery I tried to purchase for a Mac Powerbook Titanium G4 15"" computer which would not operate the computer. A third company sold me one which works fine. I can't comment on battery life since the battery continually popped out of its slot. This company has explained how to return the battery and since they have responded well to my inquiries, I assume I'll be receiving a refund as I did from the first company, and at that point I would probably give it a high review."
1,Never delivered by Supa Dupa,"Supa Dupa never delivered the product. The delivery date was specified as between December 3 and December 20. It's still not arrived, despite having been paid for - I checked on that this week.I've sent TWO messages to Supa Dupa, a week apart, and still have not heard back. This is a great disappointment, as I was expecting it to be delivered before Christmas.If I could give NO stars, I would. I have no idea whether the actual battery would be any good, since it has not been delivered, over a month after my account being charged."
5,"GOOD PRICE, QUICK SERVICE",How can you go wrong with a new battery that's 'way under the Apple price and delivered expeditiously.
1,Beatles' Elavator Music,"This is just a very poor recording of Beatles' music. It is thin, ""sing-songy"", and just unimaginatively arranged and played. Pedestrian is the apt word. There are good instrumental recordings of Beatles' music available. This isn't one of them. It was a Christmas present I should have returned."
3,The world did not end when the Beatles did.,"It is true that there are four of them. But to give them an important place in the book of ""Revelation"" is a little much. Yes, their lives did not become the best of role models for teenagers or older fans. What about Iron Maiden, and Black Sabbath who seemed to more openly express non-Christian views. The Beatles were only a small part of a great world of wild rock 'n rollers."
1,The Beatles Happy Go Lucky Kids? Or Lucifers Demonic Agents?,The Beatles Seem to be the perfect symbols of the 6o's... But there is more to them then meets the eye. they are the four horse men of the apcolypse. with thier songs sexual words they have singlehandedly caused the distruction of western civilization. so dont cheer the beetles maim and kill them.
1,So Bad I Had to Laugh . . .,Remember that guy who sat at the music store's organ at the mall on Sunday afternoons hoping to entice you to buy an organ with his magic fingers? This CD begins with a ridiculous polka-esque rhythm and gets worse as each organ-generated-sounding instrument is introduced into the mix. Fit only for a Sunday afternoon retro skating party! Hysterically hilarious!
5,"Inspiring affirmation, the perfect bedside book.","Whoever wrote that other review must have a personal axe to grind. I don't know either one of these writers, and believe me, I found ""Hug The Monster"" to be not only a delight from beginning to end but also - finally! - a self-help book that actually delivers what it promises through exercises in overcoming fear that really can and do make a difference. I don't just keep a copy on my nightstand, I've given several copies as gifts to friends, and they've gone on to buy copies for their friends as well. My family has even tried some of the exercises as a group and learned a lot about ourselves and each other, while having a great time in the process. Seriously, don't miss this book! You'll be losing out on some valuable self-knowledge if you do. Lindsay999@aol.com"
2,don't waste your time or money,"Don't waste your time and money with this one. David Smith makes his point about the so called ""hugging the monster"" in the first 20 pages. It can be summed up in a Nike commercial, ""Just Do It"". The rest of the 200+ page book is merely the vehicle for this egotistical, self-centered, ex-athlete turned motivational speaker (a poor one at that) to tell you all about his adventures which happened a LOOOOONG time ago. I've met him. Don't bother"
1,A Sure Way to Discipline Unruly Kids................,"...If you have unruly kids, make them watch this. This movie is so bad, kids will straighten right up and promise to behave. Hard cases may require a second viewing....About this movie that was made for kids, one reviewer said,""Showing this film to its intended audience could constitute child abuse."""
3,12 inch iBook replacement battery,"I received this battery about one month ago. While it is better than having no battery power at all, I was surprised at how quickly this battery loses charge compared with my original iBook battery when the laptop was new. The replacement battery holds about three hours of charge, and my original iBook battery held a little over four hours of charge at its peak. Still at the price I paid, three hours of charge time is much better than being wired to an outlet for all use. The replacement battery is light grey in color and not stark white, so that makes it a very obvious replacement, but it does work and fits well. I would actually rate it a 3.5, but this scale only allows for whole number rating."
3,Useable and practical but battery life a little short,"Product works fine and doesn't show any signs of disfunction. I only wish that the battery life lasted longer than 3hrs. As a side note however, it does re-charge pretty quickly."
4,Good Replacement!,"The original battery on my ibook had completely died. I bought this replacement, I have had it for about a month and it holds a 3 hour charge. If you need a replacement battery and want a cheap option, this is a good choice. I have had no problems with it at all."
1,apple i-book G4 battery,"the battery you sent was not the right size, so we limped along staying plugged into a 120vac receptacle. Henceforward I will ignore the advice given me at the Apple Store and wait my turn to have an expert LOOK at the computer and sell me the right battery. I'm not a particularly happy camper."
2,Not enough juice,I was disappointed in the life of the battery. I have a G3 12 inch iBook. The battery only lasts a little over two hours. If I was buying again I would go with another battery. Good luck.
5,great item,"Very tasty, worked perfectly in a cookie recipe and two different muffin batches. It didnt even occur to me at first that I needed a vanilla extract substitute, but when it did, I'm glad I found this. Will definitely buy again."
2,Authentic but not Pure,"Authentic Foods Vanilla PowderSilica is sand (typically made into glass) and ""cane juice"" I assume is ""sugar cane juice"" which is of course sugar."
3,Cassie Binegar-all right,"This book is written by Patricia MacLachlan. This is the first one of her books that I have read that I have been disappointed in-all the rest of her books that I have read were amazing! I thought that it ended too soon and that the plot sort of weakened off at the end. This book is all right, but you'd be better off reading another one of MacLachlan's books."
4,The Idea of Change.,"In ""Cassie Binegar,"" Cassie, the main character, did not like the idea of change. She wanted orderliness in her life and strived to achieve it. She eventually learned to view life through her family's eyes and learned a very valuable lesson; that things don't stay the same forever. I would definitely recommend this book for young adolescents. They will find it very easy to relate to the experiences in the book. km"
1,did not like theology of book,"Started reading this and put it down. Theologically flawed perspective and could not read the whole thing. It comes from perspective that can reach a point of ""full holiness"" or ""entire santictification"" in this life time and disagree with that premise."
1,Not for Vista!,"This scanner will NOT work with Vista. HP has no Vista driver for it, and apparently no intention of ever supplying one. A generic scanner program doesn't seem to solve the problem either. don't try this with Vista."
1,Displeased,I'm not the best with computers but the HP 4300Cse scanner has not performed for me. It took 2 hours after it downloaded right off but wouldn't scan. It finally scanned a picture. Now the computer will not pick up that there is a scanner but all the downloads are there. To call the 800 number you get a recording that it will be ... to speak to someone.
5,Lovely,"this bracelet always brightens up my day and makes me want 2 sing. every ghost spirit i see compliments this braclet. ever since i bought this braclet and put it on i feel like smashing peoples heads against brick walls. sometimes i even have the urge 2 beat myself up in public places with a light saber. and 1 time while wearing the braclet a man came up 2 me & speared me with a tridentgood times, good times"
1,"Walk of Faith, review","If you are looking for a near death experience memoir- this is not the best choice.It is not well written, nor very interesting. The author quotes often from the bible to make her point, and the whole atttempt comes across as preachy and pedantic. I was disappointed. The book didn't resonate with me, and I didn't find it inspiring."
2,Quite an imagination,"I read this book and at best it is simply entertaining, hence the two stars, otherwise it would be only one star. I do not believe this woman's story. She admits to having been treated for brain damage and mental problems due to an auto accident she was in. I'm sure anyone who is medicated for brain problems could invent such a story. She claims God is very personal to her and comes to her in visions, this I find unbelievable, not unbelievable in a ""wow"" way, but unbelievable in a "" I don't think so"" way. If you are looking to be entertained this book is ok, but I'd rather rent Star Wars for entertainment."
5,A Lesson in Education,"In Irrigating Deserts, Joel D. Heck of Concordia University at Austin has produced a wonderful book on the educational philosophy of the noted educator and writer C. S. Lewis. The title of the book is derived from the following quote by Lewis, where he writes in The Abolition of Man: ""The task of the modern educator is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts."" This is an excellent book that provides a focused view on an important aspect of Lewis's life. Dr. Heck has made a significant contribution to Lewis scholarship."
3,Works as it is supposed to but not the best choice for a very short spine,"This works as it is supposed to, but tends to slip up from the waist and has to be pulled down fairly often. Since I am short, the upper back area can slip up and hurt my neck while I'm sitting at the computer. Definitely needs to be worn over some type of clothing."
5,Keeping promises,Wonderful strategies that are based on scripture. Encouragement for those that want to keep a life-long promise.
3,"Daughter loves it, but some manufacturing flaws.","Bought this for my daughter when she was four years old. She loves it, and does her homeschool work on it. The desk is very sturdy and has many neat little storage crannies she likes to put scissors, pencils, etc. into. The bench rolls and the top lifts up for more storage. There is also a door on the student's right side that opens and there are two very deep shelves for additional storage.The negatives are slight manufacturing flaws. The bench fits very snuggly into the desk which makes sitting down and getting out difficult. The wheels on the bench kept popping out and we feared our daughter's feet getting crushed, but were able to gorilla glue them into place and have never had another problem. The paper roll really is not very useful since the paper rolls back up when kids try to draw on it.So, it is a neat desk with cool features, but could have been manufactured a little better."
1,I Could Care Less,The book is about some kids who get a new gym teacher. He is very short. The kids think he is a leprechaun. The kids learn some things about leprechauns and try to figure out if their teacher is one.My opinion is that this book is not as great as other books in the Bailey School series. Not much happened in the story. The ending is so frustrating that I did not care if the guy was a leprechaun or not!
3,Is magic true,this book is rather funny because there coach magic ''o'' grady is a leprechaun.Eddie is going to prove them wrong. My favorite chapter was Master trickstar because the bailey kids find out that magic ''o'' grady is a leprechaun.
5,Tyler Perry's House of Payne 5,"I love Tyler Perry's House of Payne 5. We keep it in the DVD player and watch it over and over again. It is so funny, and the whole family enjoys it."
1,Cant get a good copy,"I love this show i think its really funny but for some reason i cant get a goodcopy. i have vol. 1-4 but vol. 5 skips. i try to watch episode 5 disc 1 and it will always Freeze im on my third copy of vol. 5 and every copy crashes on my blu-ray player, my dvd player, my two xbox 360 and my portable dvd player. has anyone elsehad this problem?"
1,I have NOT received my order!,"Im sure this is a GREAT product...Tyler Perry never seems to disappoint, but as of this date, I have NOT received my dvd! Can someone please help!"
4,A delightful discovery.,"I came to this album because Russell Crowe participates on one track. But I discovered a lovely talent and some very effective songs. Wendy was new to me, but I will be watching her work from here on. A Beautiful View is a delight - try it!"
2,they don't make things like they used to...,This is not the seller's fault...the manufacturer has gone to a less expensive material and though I haven't used it yet...I can tell it won't last as long as the one I lost...and I fear it will fail while in use causing a lot of foul language and general disappointment
3,Distracting,"Max McLean has a nice, deep voice, but I found his reading style very distracting, because of the way he keeps changing speeds and randomly pausing. For me, you can't beat Alexander Scourby for reading the Bible."
3,ESV The Listener's Bible Review,"I recently purchased the Listener's Bible from Amazon.com. Max Mclean does a fantastic job reading through the Bible and really helping to make it come alive. Plus having an audio Bible makes it much easier to immerse yourself in the Scriptures ie. listening in the car etc.However, I was a little dissapointed that Max didn't read the Bible with the same emotion and stage presence that he does in many of his live performances, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. If you've never had the chance to hear Max live, you cand download some free examples on thelistenersbible.com."
5,A great tool to saturate your mind in God's Word,"I bought this to listen on my ipod. It's one of the best thing I did to help my mind to be more saturated with and to meditate on the Word. With ESV as the most accurate and readable translation, Max McLean's calm and not so dramatic reading helps the listener to focus on the content rather than on the reading itself. Its background ambiance track is faint yet appropriately present that adds to the weight of the passages. For those who have not tried audio Bible, I highly recommend it as it is how most of the original audience of the Scripture heard, through oral reading."
2,100% whole wheat pretzels,I love their sesame whole wheat sticks but these are just not so good. It is unfortunate because I love whole wheat and pretzels but like another reviewer said they have a funny taste.
1,Whole Wheat?,"Sounded like a great idea - whole wheat pretzels! But they have a very funny, unidentifiable taste which you can smell when you open the bag. Love most whole wheat stuff but just don't like these."
5,compelling and real collection of what really matters,"It's all here: the joy of friendships, the heartbreak of betrayals, the importance of family, the passion for life that we may have lost long ago, and most importantly, this collection lets us look back on our own decisions through other people's letters. I read about kind and horrible bosses and realized I've learned how to avoid one and attract others. Several letters told poignantly about illness and loss of a loved one and, for the first time in a decade, I lost it emotionally thinking about the promises I made my dad before he passed away. Most of all I was struck by Rick Ritacco, who seemed to be an OK dad, advising his kids to be respectful rebels, and that ""we are on this earth for a short time -- make the earth turn, don't just sit and watch it."" The book's author says we already know what really matters, we just need to ""quiet the outside noise long enough to hear the heartbeat of our own wisdom."" Amen! Great book."
1,This is the first time I felt cheated at Amazon,"The Cassette to CD conversion does not work as stated. Also, this is a free download from the web that this gentleman was selling. He had no return policy and when I let you know that the product did not work as promised, he was making all these non-sense deals. Thanks to Amazon, they reviewed my complaint and promised to refund the whole amount- price plus shipping charges."
1,Rip-off,"Not happy with product seller. Site is very misleading. Returned it after 14-day trial...didn't even try it because I knew it wasn't what my husband wanted, and have yet to receive my refund!! I'm sure you can find something to accomplish the same task much cheaper!!"
2,"Cute, but...............................","This night-light is so sweet and goes with the rest of our nursery decor but now that my son is walking around he managed to pull the cover right off. There are metal rods underneath the already sharp plate-cover and had I not noticed this right away he could've been seriously hurt. I would not advise anyone to spend the money on this. It works fine until they are crawling and walking around, but it's not worth the money for such a short time of use."
3,Nice light if outlet isn't near floor,"I love all of the Malawi products, but the nightlight doesn't look good if your outlets are situated near the floor. You just see the naked bulb beaming up at you. It would look great if I had outlets that were midway up my walls."
3,cute,"This is cute, and a good light, but mine broke as soon as I took it out of the package. The way the front is attached it could also be pulled off very easily by a small child crawling around!"
2,having second thoughts,"I ordered this along with a bunch of other Malawi themed products. The night light was poorly packed and the front plastic plate arrived broken. That in itself is not a big deal, but the whole thing is made in China and looks rather cheap and loosely snapped together. I've decided I'm not going to use it as a nightlight because I won't feel comfortable leaving it on when I'm not in the room (as opposed to the Malawi lamp, which I will use, but turn off before leaving.) I'm going to try get a more substantial looking light from a known manufacturer."
4,Does exactly what I needed it to do,"I was having trouble finishing the P90X workouts after 6 months of doing them. Just running out of energy. This drink gives me the juice to finish, and break about 80% of my personal bests in the process. Gear results. I deducted 1 star for the taste. On ice it's ok, but I wouldn't say it's great tasting."
2,Not what it says,"My main issue with this product is that i received the old formula with the old label. I wanted to try fast twitch because it was apparently caffeine free. That may be the case with the new formula but not the one i received. I have used it two times now and the product is a good pre workout supplement offering a good pump and good energy boost, however, it is not my favorite. Besides the caffeine that wasn't supposed to be in it, my second issue is the taste. It's a very potent pre workout compared to a Superpump Max by Gaspari that tastes more like a juice. Fast twitch is just very strong. I'm not totally sure if i did not mix it into enough water. Bottom line is that for the price it is worth it to try it out because you may see better results."
5,great product,This is a great product and is the best tasting out of all your flavors. I have also tried the power punch flavor and switched back to the grape. It is also good because you only have to take it on the days that you work out on and its easy on the stomach.
2,"Nice, effective product, but the taste is horrible..","Don't get me wrong, Fast Twitch is a great product. However, I was replenishing my supply, and tried the grape flavor..Oh man, it was crazy horrible. I'm usually fine with tastes, too. I eventually tossed what was left and switched to pink lemonade. Totally pleased."
5,"pre workout,",I loved this pre workout! This is perfect for 24 hr gym time because it doesnt have that caffine twitch to it so you can use it at night even and be able to sleep without the jitter bug all night long.
1,Do not buy this product!,"I have used several pre-workout supplements before and this is the worst of all of them, it does give you some endurance and some strength for workout but it has that artificial sweetener taste which will stay in your throat for the rest of the night though I drank 3-4, 16oz of water after workout. The only thing I could conclude is that liver and kidneys were not able to clean that artificial flavors. I bought two tubs after reading all the rave reviews it got, but man it tastes so bad and my mouth has that sweet (artificial chemical) taste until I wake up in the morning (I workout in the evening at around 6pm). The reason I switched to fast twitch from NO Xplode 2.0 was because NO Xplode got some reviews which mentioned hyper liver enzymes (which I never experienced myself personally, maybe because I took only one scoop per day) but I didn't want to take risk with that product. I think I'm gonna continue working out without any pre-workout supplement."
3,Not great.,This stuff wears off way to quickly. Not nearly as affective as the companies previous line of NOS booster drink. I would recommend looking else where.
4,Worked for me,"This worked for me. It gave me noticable pump and endurance for my workouts. I had to get used to the taste... it just doesn't taste natural nor good.It's always interesting when you buy these supplements because you never know if it'll work for you as advertised. I've tried a few different varieties of supplements and none of them really worked like they were promised. I don't put too much faith in these products but I do think if used correctly, a lot of them could give you an edge. I believe Fast Twitch is one of those products. It did work for me... nothing miraculous but it helped me to workout a little harder so no complaints here. I guess it's up to you to decide if what you pay for this is worth that."
1,coming from a person who thinks everything tastes good.... this is nasty.,"so i've been taking body effects (which i love)... but that is so expensive, and i'm so cheap. so i tried this stuff. great reviews equals great taste, right? -wrong. woah, this is nasty stuff! is this a hunger suppressant too? because it's so nasty it makes me so nauseous, i don't even wanna eat! geez, i'm not even playing! i have to mix it with something else. i didn't even feel it working. anywho, don't buy this. i'm gonna try something else. BUT i'm still gonna finish this, because i'm cheap. :) & i already bought it. take my advice."
5,Terrific goggles,"I had an old pair of Aqua Sphere goggles that lasted me well over 5 years. They were so good and comfortable that I never felt any desire to try on any other goggles but last week they were stolen from my locker so I had to go get some new ones.I tried a pair of Speedos that were about ten dollars more expensive but they were too small and uncomfortable so I settled for the Kaimans. That turned out to be the right decision. Not only were the goggles less expensive, they were more comfortable and far more functional. The lenses curve around the side and my field of vision is now greatly enhanced. The lenses also make everything brighter and the neoprene strap and suction cups are comfortable, don't fog up and don't let any water in.This is pretty much a perfect pair of goggles."
3,"Goggles are fine, but leave deep ring marks","I purchased this pair of goggles after reading several online reviews for Kaiman goggles claiming that they were less likely to leave marks for people with deep-set eyes. Unfortunately, the Kaiman left goggle marks just like my Speedo goggles did except that they were on the outside of my eye sockets, making them even more visible.Since I've given up on finding a pair of goggles that don't make me look like an albino raccoon after a swim, this problem alone wouldn't have affected my rating. Unfortunately, the Kaiman goggles also add a bit of distortion and they tend to leak unless I have them situated just right. How they can both leak and leave trenches all the way around my eyes is a complete mystery to me."
5,Best Goggles Ever Owned,These look awesome on. Help with the Sun and stay fog free (Although I do add some stuff). Very comfortable as well. My new favorites
2,Less than satisfactory,"Bought these to do my first triathlon. These were billed as the choice goggle for Ironman. For me, they leaked and a little too heavy on the seal. Redness and soreness around the eyesockets and at times my eyes did touch the lens and no I do not have bulging eyeballs. Lots of suction on the eyes and yet they still leaked. I bought a 3 pairs of Speedo goggles from Costco for the same price as this pair and the Speedo goggles worked great. Though I wouldn't purchase Aqua Sphere again, I believe these would be fine for different shaped face. For me, they were just not satisfactory."
2,leaked water,"I ordered two pairs of these goggles. One works great, while the other leaks water and now it's too late to return it so I'm stuck with it. I probably won't buy this brand of goggles again."
2,Mirrored goggles go hazy,"We bought 3 pairs, tried 2 and they both fogged up terribly. I was really disappointed as I had these goggles in the past with stellar results (even the pair I had bought last year and still own did a stellar job this year). I tried 2 of the 3 pairs and both were terrible. I may look into getting the spray but I've always been told that saliva does a better job of keeping the fog away. Maybe the 3rd pair will do better but I hold little hope. I may be switching to Speedo if the spray doesn't work."
3,One draw back,"My US masters swim buddy was kind enough to buy them from me. I tried them a couple of times in the pool but would blur the lines on the pool floor. I realized the design has a very shallow curve and because my eye lashes are long they would brush against the goggle and cause my vision to go blurred. That was the only complain, the straps are easy to use and the goggles look great. So all you fellows with long eye lashes you may want to think twice before purchasing these goggles. Thanks"
1,Leaky Goggles,"I bought a pair of these and they started leaking after 2 weeks of use. I take excellent care of my stuff too. I complained to aqua sphere and they replaced them. Great customer service. The second pair were excellent, no issues. I bought another pair and had the same issue as the first, they leak. They suction well on the face, until you do a flip turn, it doesn't matter how tight the goggles are, they leak. I do not recommend these. While they are comfortable and such, they are just faulty."
3,One of Caron's better offerings,"3 and 1/2 stars. Luckily, on my skin Miss Rocaille is really pretty. Mandarin, lilac, muget, well done jasmine and violet-laced powder. This isn't a scent I'd normally be attracted to, but I really like this one. it makes me want to wrap myself in warm handmade quilts in the winter and walk in a flower garden in the summer. The box is really cute with the little polka dots & girly pink bottle. Very girly and pixish. Worth a try!"
5,ONE OF THE 70'S BEST,"BOYLAN's MASTERPIECE - with fine arrangements, super California studio sound and session players among Eagles guys and related others backing up super songwriting, great production. This memorable recording plays over and over, continues to sound good today. Second album Suzy has its moments too. The CD is excellent compilation with a few new songs I liked for the writing, was self worked and hope Terence would redo with a set up band again. Compiled with some pretty incredible work, truly choice tunes, Trains, Hey Papa, The War is Over, Dancing Shoes (some songs have been covered). A friend suggested they didn't like the piano synth. Whatever. One of those albums that fits all together, like CSN's first as an example, because it's real good."
4,To Finish a Scarf!,The yarn came very quickly. I started a scarf and didn't have enough so I looked on-line since the local yarn shop no longer carries this yarn. This was the only place I could find the color I needed. It's a beautiful yarn - a little darker than the dye lot I was using but it blends well.
3,Good...,Japanese products never cease to disapoint me. Each character is detailed and come with a stand for it. Price is still higher than if u bought it at a store. but thats what u get from an import. Candy is good too. (also included in the box)
4,"Charming Little Children's Storybook, Except...","[SPOILER ALERT!]...one of the main characters has two heads. I don't know if you have a problem with that, but I sure as hell do."
2,My review,"This book is not very good because the end is very unsettling, the intro is in the middle of the book, and really doesn't talk about the overall population of conjoined twins. I wouldn't reccomed this book to most people."
4,DAisy and Violet!?,This book was very informative yet not detailed far enogh to get all the info yet it is very good and very true
2,Not Worth It,"Drew Fickett vs. Kurt PellegrinoGilbert Aldana vs. Cheick KongoJeff Monson vs. Anthony PeroshHermes Franca vs. Joe JordanYves Edwards vs. Joe StevensonJosh Burkman vs. Josh NeerDan Christison vs. Frank MirTito Ortiz vs. Ken ShamrockTim Sylvia vs. Andrei ArlovoskiThe Edwards/Stevenson fight and the Franca/Jordan fight are the highlights of this event. The main events are just terrible. If you sat through Sylvia/Arloveski III the first time, you won't be able to the second time around. Ortiz and Shamrock was a huge letdown and waste. The rest of the card just isn't that strong. A lot of new guys, a bunch off of the Ultimate Fighter, and a really out of shape Frank Mir. The dvd quality is just okay. They do include a few nice extras pre and post fight. Most of that stuff I caught on various UFC shows, but it was nice to include it on the dvd. This is for completionists only."
2,Not so good.,"Overall I have to give UFC 61 a big thumbs down. Sylvia v. Arlovski did have to happen, but it was a very, very boring fight. Sylvia fought as a counter-fighter - in other words he pretty much waited for Arlovski to throw something and then he would counter with his own strikes. Its tough for a fight to be exciting when one fighter is forced to initiate all of the action.Tito v. Ken - I was really looking forward to seeing this - another big let down - very anti-climatic.Frank Mir's comeback - oh man, that was rough to see. I know he was in a motorcycle accident but it was very hard for me to see him in the shape he was in.Wait to see this on Spike TV or something or go to youtube or something - its not really worth your money."
2,pre-lims > main card,"Very rarily will you see a main card event that is below the preliminary fights.Fickett/Pellegrino was a very action packed fight, something you should always expect from Fickett. Pellegrino did move up to 170lbs for this fight, but luckily for those who enjoy his style, he has moved back down to the 155lbs division.Cheick Kongo makes his UFC debut taking on Gilbert Aldana (RIP) in a display of strikes from the outside and a superb clinch game.Jeff Monson/Anthony Perosh is a battle of 2 ground technicians who actually take it to their feet and display not great technique, but tremendous power.Hermes Franca/Joe Jordan, what can you say? Franca is a machine and Jordan took this fight on short notice. Good showing by both in a action filled contest of the little guys.The rest of the night, the main card....dismal. One man bleeds profusely, another fighter is robbed by the judges, a rematch that didn't need to happen, battle of Josh's, and a timid main event"
2,hmmm rainbows,"Even though this is a relatively cheap lens, I still think it could be a little bit better. There is quite a bit of distortion (barreling) which I guess is to be expected considering it is a cheap lens (nice wide angle lenses can cost [much, much more]). The barreling I can live with considering the price and what I use it for, but the chromatic aberrations are really really bad. If you want to see rainbows then this camera is great--taking a picture of the stars reveals them to be giant rainbows... Yeah, not nice. Under normal uses (i.e. non point light sources like the stars), this will usually manifest itself in blue and red outlines around objects. If I take off this lens and just use the camera's internal lens I don't have these problems, so it is definitly the wide angle lens causing the problems."
2,For a Regular DVD Twilight Zone Afternoon.,"This DVD features four chapters of the Twilight Zone Series. None of them is really a classic, and all of them are taken from different seasons. Despite that, they really represent the basic concepts that made this TV Show an international and timeless phenomena. In ""One for the Angels"" (Season 1) meet Death itself about to take a young girl's life, but facing a persuasive door to door salesman. ""The Man in the Bottle"" (Season 2) is certainly about a genie, but an evil one. ""The Arrival"" bends the boundaries between reality and imagination for the astonished characters trying to figure out the misterious appearance of a commercial airplane completely empty. ""In Praise of Pip"" (Season 5) stars Jack Klugman (""Quincy"") as a desperate father anguished by the probable death of his son (portrayed first by Billy Mummy -""Lost in Space""- and later by Bob Diamond). All four episodes were written by series creator Rod Serling."
4,Fun Dinosaur Facts,My 6 year old daughter got this as a gift and spent the whole day playing with it. The adults would call out answers while she excavated the bones. Some are very tricky to grip without making the Dino ghost roar but that made it even better when she did it. My 10 year old nephew enjoyed the witty answer choices. I highly recommend it for dinosaur fans.
1,One day of fun then nothing!!!!,"My son received this item for Christmas, We played with it for about 30 minutes on Christmas and then put it away. The next day I took it out and it no longer functioned."
4,Fun toy,"My son loves this game. It has educational quiz cards as well. Only thing we didn't like is if you touched the sides while trying to get a bone, the buzz didn't always work."
1,Pray Along Rosary with Mysteries of Light,"This is an abysmal recording (or re-recording) effort. The music background is totally distorted to the point of being painful and distracting to hear, and the voices are frequently distorted also. I'm struly sorry to say this, for the predecessor to this tape was excellent. It's just that my copy of the earlier tape is wearing out and, though I've tried,I can't find another to buy."
2,Disappointed in this guide,"I bought this book and was given a copy of the Moon guide to Yosemite. The Lonely Planet guide has color photos but what I really needed was help in planning a big family and friends camping trip. The Moon guide had a lot of information about different ways to ""do"" Yosemite, it was more like a guide tha Lonely Planet's book. The outdoor recreation coverage was better too."
3,"Maybe good to Yosemite, but not so good to Sequoia & Kings Canyon","I bought this book to use it in Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Park, if you intend to use in these parks I did not recommend. I dont know about the Yosemith (thats why I gave 3 star, I would like to gave two and half), but there is little information about S&KC and lack of maps. The part related to S&KC is just one or two stars."
4,Visually nice.,"Good sized skillet. Retains heat well, so you can turn down the heat as you cook, which saves on heating. However, it is heavy to lift with one hand. It hasn't been heating the bread evenly for making grilled cheese sandwiches, but I am new to cooking with Porcelain enameled cast iron."
1,Big disappointment,"This product arrived with a large chip out of the colored enamel right out of the box... everything sticks even when swimming in oil... too heavy to make it worth sending back... don't waste your money... stick with the old fashioned cast iron, season it well and enjoy... this is just more made in China junk... shame on Lodge!"
2,excited about cast iron enamel at first. Now totally disappointed.,I was so excited to finally get my lodge cast iron skillet with the enamel coating. Had it only a month. Was washing dishes near the sink and I had placed my new skillet there to be washed. I was loading the dishwasher and bumped a glass cup against the end of the handle and it chipped off. Since then it doesn't take anything to chip the enamel. I spoke with lodge mfg and they said that this was under the warranty for abuse and was not covered. A lot of money was put out and it doesn't seem worth it to have to baby a skillet. I will stick with plan cast iron or stainless steel from now on. You have to also be very careful how you was the outside enamel. Just not worth it. So disappointed.
5,"Cost Less; Does as Much as ""L C""","While attempting to cook like Julia Child I decided I need a few pieces of enamel cast iron cookware. I couldn't afford the ""hi price stuff"" so I decided on a couple pieces of Lodge Enamel Coated Cast-Iron in Red. It worked well and the baeuf bourguignon turned out great. The cookware is easy to clean and pretty to look at.Happy cooking,Chintzy"
2,Made in China,Was disappointed to see another great US company like Lodge being manufactured overseas. The interior coating looks like it was put on with a worn out paintbrush. Very poor quality. I will stick with my Lodge none coated US made cookware.
1,poor quality construction,"Exterior coating of pan was chipped when received, Did not know that Lodge was made in China. Very poor quality, especially from Lodge."
4,I would buy this again,"I was very hesitant to purchase this because of some reviews for other Lodge products. It turns out that this is a solid piece of cookware. Nice finish & works well on a ceramic cooktop. I have only owned this for 3 weeks, but I have found no flaws. Very easy cleanup."
2,returning mine,"I love cast iron and could not imagine cooking without it. I can not use my original Lodge on my induction cooktop. I wanted a replacement and an Enameled cast iron product was a great solution. Le Creuset is the highest rated however,a very expensive choice compared to Lodge. I was excited to find a Lodge enamel at Target and purchased mine about 3 mos. ago. It began chipping alomost immediately, mostly around the handle(s) and rim. Now large chunks are coming off the bottom. It is unusable. I am going to try to take back to Target and will purchase a Le Creuset as soon as possible."
2,returned -- not as promised,"Thank goodness for amazon's easy return policy. This item was described as ""The porcelain surface eliminates the need to season cast iron"" but the interior of the pan does not have a porcelain surface but rather is a course flat black iron like surface that is sticky. I used this pan once, and decided it was not for me. The outside of the pan is nice and slippery like my cast iron enameled dutch oven. I guess it pays to buy the twice expensive french cast iron skillets instead of this less expensive stuff made in china. Lesson learned.....for now :-)"
3,"Okay, better and worse than regular cast iron","Pro'sThis is a nice heavy skillet that you shouldn't have to reseason. It also looks good enough for table service and is fairly economical to buy. You can use soap to wash it to your hearts content and you really want to because of the enamel. With care it should last a very long time.Con'sIt is more expensive than plain cast iron and still reqires an initial seasoning or break in that is more troublesome than plain, unseasoned cast iron. It is also more likely to chip or crack through the enamel layer if you don't let it cool down enough prior to washing. Also, you need to be careful when seasoning to stay off of the enamel. Lastly, I would not put this in a dishwasher.Overall, I think the plain 12 inch cast iron skillet is still king of the cooktop for gas or electric coil. Once you master the seasoning process, its not really that much upkeep. The enameled cast iron would be an easy choice for smooth top ranges and service to the table."
5,Great pan for searing and holding in the juices,"I bought this pan knowing that I would use it on the cook top and the oven, and this pan does not dissapoint. It holds the heat very well and does a fantastic job of searing meat."
1,Hot spots and Sticky!,"I bought this skillet hoping to find an alternative to Teflon covered non-stick skillets. Unfortunately, this skillet is not it. The heat distribution is very very poor. Food will burn in the middle and barely cook on the sides. I actually have to move the skillet around over the burner to heat up different areas.And the food will stick, no matter how much oil you put in it.I can't wait to find a better skillet and toss this in the garbage..."
1,Didn't keep it,"I can really say if this is a good product or not. It arrived in the original box, but it looked old, opened, and used. When I opened the box the red porcelain was badly chipped in many places. I returned the pan and will not reorder."
1,Made in China,I did not purchase my Lodge frying pan from Amazon but the one I got from another source was made in China. I thought that Lodges products were made in the US. Apparently not any more.
5,Awesome!,"Love this pan. It heats gently, evenly and holds the heat to cook my meals through. Food does NOT need to be cooked on high, and this pan is exactly why. I was raised with cast iron, and this is so easy to clean and looks fab wile using it. No seasoning the pan before using it! Its so totally great! All of the benefits of cast iron w/o the drawbacks! I am buying more items like it, dutch ovens, casserole, etc. Just read the instructions, no dishwasher, no metal, and general care, and these will last you a lifetime. Just like my grandmother passed to my mother, and she is not willing to let go of yet, so I am getting my own, only better!"
2,Unhappy,"This is not as the description says. Everything sticks, even with oil. The coating was so thin that some of the cast iron was showing."
1,Defective,"I bought this from Amazon seller Bargain The People and had to pay return shipping even though the bottom of the skillet was concave.I have an induction stove, which needs pans with flat bottoms. The center of the bottom was one-eighth inch or so below the level of the outside rim.In fact, a ring of only about one-half inch wide around the circumference of the bottom would touch the cooktop surface."
3,"Lodge Color Skillet, Island Spice Red","The enamel on this product tends to chip but I guess for the price it is ok. It really is not the same quality as my Le Creuset, but then you get what you pay for."
4,"better than cast iron, not quite a smooth surface","I love my enameled cast iron pots and dutch oven because they conduct heat like cast iron but are much easier to clean (gunk just wipes off the enamel). I also don't have to worry about cooking with tomatoes or vinegar. I bought this pan to ""replace"" my cast iron ones, but the inside surface of the pan isn't smooth like the inside of the dutch ovens. It's a little bumpy and rough. Not really sure why - maybe it's trying to mimic cast iron? Because of this, it's not as easy to clean and it's not as non-stick as I'd like. If I add a thin layer of oil to it before heating, it does perform wonderfully, though.Overall, it's a good pan and I use it frequently, but you should know that the inside surface is quite different from typical enameled cast iron."
2,Looking for an Alternative to Teflon? Keep Looking.,"In order to achieve any sort of non-stick quality, it's necessary to use a lot of oil. Even when using a lot of oil, though, I often wound up with half of my food (e.g. hashbrowns or eggs) stuck to the pan. This pan made me dread cooking.If you're looking for an alternative to teflon coated or infused pans, I highly recommend Martha Stewart's GreenPans. I had previously used Calphalon for many years, and I'm finding that GreenPans perform as well or better.If you really want to cook with cast-iron, though... If you're having trouble flipping something, stop and wait. When the part of the food touching the pan has cooked thoroughly, it is more likely to ""release"" better. (It's similar to cooking on a hard-anodized surface.)"
5,"So Easy, Don't Think of it as Wax","I started using the Armor All Gels System shortly after it came to market. Its claim to fame is you do not need a bucket to accomplish a wash. The wash gel works up into a rich, thick lather (I know, sounds like a bath soap commercial). Having a bucket of clear water standing by does help. I dip my wash towel in the bucket when the suds get too thick.The next step is the wax. I squirt a little on each body panel as I'm drying the vehicle. It is nice because even when the vehicle is starting to spot the wax cuts through the spots and leaves you with a nice finish.I have found using micro-fiber towels, aid in the performance of this product."
5,"""Outstanding! """,One of the best bands I've heard in the past 10 years! Truly a remarkable sound. FRESH.........An album full of VIBE! BUY IT NOW!
3,Just Average,"This book is just average. There is some good information, but the author spends too much time talking about her photos and how she took them. The information about releases is valuable."
3,The Warrior Returns,"Well, it's Allan Cole, it's another book in the Antero saga (the last one, and that's probably a good thing), it's got Rali, it's got a new villain and some magic and some slam-bang action scenes. That, in the final analysis, is all you need to know. The tempo is off at times, with too much attention getting placed on insignificant scenes while other more important developments are rushed through. And characters other than Rali are all stultifyingly one-dimensional. But for all that, ""The Warrior Returns"" does have big vision and a sort of magnanimous energy, so three stars for this one."
1,Disappointed,"Expected just poems, not critiques and history. Wanted to give as a gift. Did not. Disappointed. Too wordy, not what I wanted."
1,"I hope that ""I Ain't Scared"" is better...","Aries Spears is cool, but I guess that I set my expectations too high for this one...I should have bought ""I Ain't Scared"" instead...I'll be selling this one immediately."
5,cute,"This is a really cute switchplate cover. It is nicely made, and goes really well with the Malawi set."
2,TDK aka Ritek,"These TDK branded CDR's are made by Ritek. Don't be fooled, go try out another brand. These TDK's are not reliable because they are manufactured at a factory not known for high quality CDR's."
4,Hold me over,I got this at the end of the baseball season so I can look at Derek everyday until Spring training! It is a bit weird to roll the mouse over his face and I think it will fade over time but it makes me happy now.
1,"""Set of 4"" Deceiving","After reading the previous review by Andrew, I thought that perhaps they had made a mistake when shipping the chairs to him. So, I decided to take a chance and order the set of 4 chairs, because the price is pretty good if you're buying FOUR chairs. Otherwise you can buy a similar chair for $15 at Ikea. However, I too received only one chair in a huge box big enough for four. It was a pain getting it to the post office to return it because the box barely fit in my car. But at least Amazon refunded me and paid for the return shipping (I have Amazon Prime so I didn't pay anything to have it shipped to me...they probably paid more for shipping than the chair was worth!). The only thing I lost was my time, and I ended up wasting more of it going to Ikea for four $15 chairs. I am disappointed that they have such a misleading title, and have not yet corrected it. So unless you're prepared to pay for only ONE chair, don't buy this product!"
2,Not Sturdy,"These were very unstable chairs, I was very disappointed and had to return them. The color was perfect, if they werejust a tad more put together I would have kept them."
2,Wobbly,These chairs (even for those well under the 200 pound mark others have mentioned) are quite wobbly. I had no confidence in them to stand the test of time if they did this immediately out of the box.
2,Low Quality,"Came as a set of 4, but the chairs do not feel very sturdy. They wobble a lot. I tried to find a way to tighten them, but they still wobble. I would not recommend these chairs for people who are north of 200lbs. The low quality of these chairs make me afraid to have anyone sit on them."
2,weight limit,"I borrowed four of these chairs from a neighbor to help seat my large Thanksgiving dinner gathering. I love how clean and simply elegant they look rather than cold impersonal metal chairs. Unfortunately, my very overweight brother decided to sit on one of these chairs. Sitting was not the problem exactly, it was the leaning back that tore the screws out of the hinge on one side and splintered the wood. I am buying more, to replace the one for my neighbor and to have some of my own. They are nice chairs, just watch the weight limit."
3,Going buck wild to nowhere,"This was easy reading to say the least. When you think of a title like going buck wild you think it's going to be filled with characters going buck wild. This does nothing. I was somewhat dissapointed. I was able to finish it because the was ""just"" enough to hold your interest.Don't let the title mislead you!"
1,Do not waste your reading time...,and please take this advice! I was waiting for some good story over here and that's what i get. The only only mistake i did was not returning the book...which i should of done when i skipped about 15 chapters to get to the end of the book. So people if you want to waste your money go ahead but i would not recommend it to anyone!!!
1,Going Buck Wrong,This book was so boring....when I first start reading I was like ok it's just starting off very slow....but as I kept reading it appear to get slower and slower....If I could I would give this book no stars...there's nothing in the characters that you can grab onto...the Cody seem to me like a stalker and Claudia just get on my nerves...I got a headache just reading this nonsense...
5,Can't Wait!,"I have bought Seasons 1, 2, and 3 of Dawson's Creek and I was so excited when I found when Season 4 is coming out. I LOVE THIS SHOW!! It's full of drama, comedy, and suspense. It also reminds me of when I was in high school and everything I had to put up with. I'm really looking forward to Oct 5!!!Oh...and BTW...Jack is so HOT in Season 3...and I bet he's even hotter in Season 4!!!"
4,RUN LIKE MAD SUCKS!!!!,"I understand that ""I don't want to wait"" is getting old listening to as the theme song for Dawson's Creek, but ""Run Like Mad"" is just a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE song and is ten times worse than ""I don't want to wait"". Plus, I think its stupid to change stuff......I like the originals."
1,Disappointing,"This season of Dawson's Creek was a huge turning point for the characters. It was a great one, however, I can't get over the fact that they changed all of the music. The music is a huge part of this show for me and it really doesn't feel like much thought was put into the changes. In several parts you can really tell the music just doesn't fit. The worst part is that the theme song has changed - the one thing people know this show by. It's just not the same without it."
1,fatal flaw in kindle edition,"if you intend to use this book for study purposes I strongly suggest you reconsider. It makes no reference to the original section numbers, rendering it virtually useless for academic purposes. And while one may believe one could avoid wasting money on such an edition by sampling it, the free sample does not go beyond the editorial introduction, providing one with no warning of it having abandoned the original section numbers. A waste of money for those who wish to academically reference it."
5,A complex phenomenon becomes easy to grasp,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and I also used it - particularly the 3-perspective approach - as a basis for teaching a graduate course on organizational culture. I found that also for the students it was a very accessible and comprehensive volume on a rather complex research field.
3,Instructive though repetitive,"It is a useful source of info for those who are interested in the theory and perspectives of organizational culture studies. It discusses at large, (sometimes excessively...!), past and current issues and controversies within this field of study.The content is excellent, the repetitive style is cumbersome."
1,I would give negative stars if possible.,"I can't believe I wasted money on this. The questions are poorly thought up. Some are even beyond pathetic with their answers. An example. ""What happened to Creighton Duke when he tried to stop Jason?"" Answer:"" He was killed."" There are tons of questions leading to the answer being ""He/She/They were killed by Jason."" I have been to many websites, and some of the answers are word for word from the site. There are pages repeated often. I got this and less then 1 hour, I tossed it in the trash. Trust me, do NOT waste your money."
4,Uses Standard HP Cartridges,"A nice feature of this printer is it uses standard hp cartridges, the same cartridges as the HP 610/612 AKA - HP #20 & HP #49. The 51649 is the same cartridge used in all HP 690 series printers for years. The 20 is a fairly new cartridge so it may be a little more uncomon to find it. You can buy these cartridges at just about any store that sells HP cartridges. This is a great feature because it is nearly imposible to find ink for some of the other lowbuck printers out there. Print quality is good & it is a cool design. ... ?"
5,rating of the apollo printer,I bought the first one that came out on the market about 3 years ago and it is still going strong I find changing the cartridges out much more easier than the other printers. I am very interested in buying another one ... .
1,Very disappointed,One and one half years old and only prints black. When I set it up the test page had color.I only printed letters and didn't knowit dosen't print color until a few days ago. Informton and helpseem non existence. Few stores stock a black cartridge.
4,Great Quality Printing,"The quality of this printer is phenomenal, I was truly impressed. The only downfall is the 6ppm, I am used to faster printers than that. This has been my absolute favorite printer."
5,Straight from the horse's (daughter's) mouth.,"What Amazon's listing doesn't tell you is that these performances are conducted by the composer's daughter, Imogen Holst - a fine musician in her own right. The whole program is interesting, but the Double Concerto for two Violins and Orchestra and the Lyric Movement for Viola and small Orchestra are more than that: significant and unjustly neglected works by a composer who is much more than just the guy who wrote The Planets. Performance and recording alike are unlikely ever to be equalled."
4,The wait is over,"It's rather unbelievable that a record as beautiful as this had to wait 27 years to first being published on cd. Again it's a combination of beautiful touching songs ( Moses & Me, Change in a Child's Hand, In a Miracle) and harder rocking, but always heartfelt songs, and Dirk's humor and irony are all over the place. If you don't know his music, but like the earliest work of Van Morrison, John Hiatt and Joe Jackson, do yourself a favour and give it a try - I guess you won't be disappointed.Meanwhile, it's a pity this rerelease hasn't received the fine treatment of earlier rereleases 'You Can Sing on the Left' and 'Alias i', which got beautiful digipacks with hard cover and a booklet - this is in a dull jewel case and there are no lyrics. Nevertheless, it's highly recommended."
2,You would THINK this was great,"But...the instructions are difficult to follow and for a timer it's counter intuitive. I also had mine for 24 hours and the little plastic tabs that hold the cover on broke off leaving me with what looks like a broken calculator. No one from the company returned my emails, so I guess it goes in the drawer with the junk."
2,Perhaps,"As a ""multi-national"" often attempting to follow a recipe in different lands with different measures, I thought this would help.Calculated Industries KitchenCalc 8300 Recipe Calculator with Digital Timer. Unfortunately, it is FAR too complicated to revise an entire recipe and after using it just a few times, the display conked out. It wasn't batteries as I was forced to purchase a new set to check. The cost to repair it (it was just out of warranty) exceeded the cost of a new one! Be careful before you spend for this."
3,KitchenCalc 8300 is a small unit,"KitchenCalc 8300I bought this unit and returned it. Why? The size. This unit does what it says, but is really for putting in a shirt pocket or purse and for travel. Because of its size I had difficulty in reading the conversion keys. I did, however, buy the Kitchen Calc Pro 8305 by the same company and love it. So because of the 8300's size I give it three stars. If you are older, I think this unit will be difficult for you to read what is on the conversion keys.Calculated Industries KitchenCalc 8305 PRO Master Chef Edition Recipe Conversion Calculator with Dual Digital TimerI am very happy with the 8305 unit. Plus, it has two timers. The 8305 isn't that much more in price. Also, the 8305 is the same high quality as the 8300, but just bigger with more features."
4,Interesting Reading,"I have long been a fan of Melody Beattie and this book is no different. Very well written and based on Melody's life experiences, this book helped me understand that, really, I am not alone in my confusion with my life."
1,Yikes--Don't buy this book.,"I loved her other books, but she writes like Polyanna on Prozac with no clear direction of where she's going. Her sing-song style doesn't jibe well and the rambling, bumbling narrative is disconcerting and unsettling. She should stop trying so hard to control her prose and just write what she feels, as she has done before and to great success."
5,Tones EveryTHING especially the arms.,"I have yet to find a good arm workout that is equivalent to this one. Jade Alexis (the trainer) encourages you to do the workout daily. If it's done that way, then result are sure to be seen. My arms were very strong when I did this workout consistently. I was amazed to see muscles in my non writing arm. Also the cardio is great. They use boxing exercises to get the heart pumping. It's fun and fulfilling. It's a great workout. I highly recommend it."
1,Worst $2 I've ever spent,"This video is NOT for people looking for a challenge. I felt like we were taking more time for breaks than actually working out. The moves were pretty basic and unoriginal. After 10 minutes, I was so utterly bored and annoyed with the trainer yelling ""stick with it"" every 10 seconds that I stopped the video and put in an old reliable Jillian Michaels DVD.If you're looking for a tough workout that will make you drip sweat, my advice is to stick with Jillian. Sorry ELLE!"
3,Annoying,"The workout itself is pretty average. You will certainly get your heart rate up, however I think that is mostly from the fact that half the workout is jumping up and down. Mostly I found the hosts to be really annoying. They just did not make it fun or interesting, and they did not make me want to keep exercising. Kind of boring...."
1,Dreadful,"EXACTLY like Jillian Michaels philosphy of workouts. Fitness is like a pap smear, necessary and completly unfun. If I craved boredom enough to enjoy this, I would just go for a run, or hop up on the hamster wheels at the gym. Miserable, unchallenging, uninteresting, and ruined my day!"
2,too expensive,"with 30 bucks i can buy 3 dvd's that do the exact same thing ! shame on elle for that ! plus the chick is way to thin, anorexia like thin, not toned at all"
4,Good comprehensive workout.,"This is a good workout, especially if you have a small space. I like that it's broken up into two segments. I would recommend taking breaks in between each time you do the workout because it's a lot of jumping and can wear on you. But highly recommend."
4,"Great workout, good dvd","Although the workout is really hard to keep up with, I feel great afterwards.The setting is nice and the sometimes annoying instructor is really motivating.Good dvd if you want to get sweaty!"
3,YAHOO!!,"I am 13 and I haven't read this type of book in about 6 months ever since my sister got me hooked on Jane Austen and L.M. Montgomery. It is in a way realistic and in a way not at all. She has a crush on the cutest guy in the school and stands up to her rights and he ends up asking her out at the end. If my 7th grade year had turned out that way believe me I would have wrote a book about it too. But I honestly do not see why on earth she would like a jerk like Scottie, And why is he still dating the coolest girlin the school when he asks her out? These are questions that I am sure can't be answered so I am just gonna retire from that sort of book untill I become a genius."
1,Very disappointing,This book was very stale and I did NOT enjoy it. I didn't even finish it all. It was too sensitive and too soft.( No action at all).
4,simple but powerful memory techniques,"This author primarily describes memory techniques such as the loci and link system so this book may not be useful to those who are already familiar with these methods. For those however who are new to the ""memory game"", this book provides simple ways of remembering anything from grocery lists to complex data. If used and practiced properly, these memory techniques can serve as powerful tools that aid in learning. The author's writing is honest, to the point, and easy to understand."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!,I LOVE it it is so very relaxing to listen to on occations when you need a dose of Star Trek.
3,A bit past his best?,"While I agree that Dominique Visse and David James (hardly the 2 outstanding countertenors of our age anyway) cannot come close to the artistry and voice of Alfred Deller, I do think that this recording leaves a little to be desired as it appears to have been made not long before he died, therefore when he was in his sixties when most singers should have given up, Deller included I'm afraid. The agility in the upper registers, the sheer brilliance of tone, both are somewhat lacking, and often the result sounds slightly strained. I would probably recommend going for the HMV recordings, as these would show Deller right at the peak of his powers, although this recording would be a good comparison of his early and late singing, and changes in performance practice."
3,His time has come and gone,"I'm really incredulous: do some people really refer to Alfred Deller as the most beautiful countertenor voice? They do! Haven't these people ever heard of David James or Dominique Visse? I fail to appreciate the ""beauty"" of Deller's voice. To me, it just sounds contrived. Well, all countertenor voices are in some way ""contrived,"" but not necessarily so. I read somewhere that, according to radiographic research, natural tenors singing in their uppermost register produce their voices by exactly the same physiological means as do falsettists. To me, that means that the higher one's natural voice is, the better is one's chance to cut it as a countertenor. Well, Deller is a natural baritone. No wonder, then, his singing is so grotesquely unnatural. Ugh. Yet, I have the greatest respect for Deller for all the work he's done raising the mainstream profile of early music and pioneering (together with Munrow) the period performance practice."
4,dialog-a-go-go,"reading gates of eden is like stepping into a movie house mid-movie...it leaves the reader greatly amused -who else could use ""bagadonuts"" as an expletive as well as coen??- he leaves one cynically aware of his blackened humour...though not all the stories are connected by one sigularily brilliant thread, they made me laugh outloud--an admirable talent.."
3,Not Bad for a Start,"Gates of Eden is a solid start to Ethan Coen's career as a writer. His film scripts and his films are some of the best out there, and it's easy to see his visual style of writing on every page; one almost expects to see ""Fade Out"" written at the end of some stories. The characters and the stories in this book are very interesting, though their small size sometimes leaves you wanting more. It's very much a storyteller's book, not heavy on the description and told like he was sitting next to you on a long car ride (if you know what I mean). I think this book is fairly enjoyable to read, overall ""light"" in subject matter and will be an entertaining company for a few weeks. Just don't expect anything out of the ordinary."
5,"Fantastic, Coenesque dreamland","A collection of stories which not only herald a long and successful career as a fictional novel writer, but which also makes definable links to the brothers film work. Original and very, very funny, in a way only ever really created by a Coen.The man is a God."
5,Master lock ez mount hitch ball,"What can I say, because the mounting is simple, and you will always have some way to keep the ball from turning as you touque the big nut tight. Very clever idea.. Brian"
4,Research this first,"The product was just as described, however it did not work as well for my grandchild as some research claimed."
1,Grifters,"The value of this NOVA cover up is the connection to the web of lies perpetrated by the US government.No steel building ever have fallen, on that day 3 fell...all defying the laws of physics.It is often noted that building 7 was ""pulled""...what is not noted is there were already explosives in place.It's time to jail those responsible....none will be Arabs NOVA should be ashamed to try and foist this ...a piece of the cover up"
4,Why The Towers Fell,"This is an excellent study on the Twin Towers disaster from an engineering point ofview. I use if for my 8th grade science students at the beginning of the year. Whileobviously appropriate for September 11th commemoration, it is also a very good lookat an historical event from a scientific angle. Physics is stressed over politics."
1,Don't waste your time with this one!!,"(Full disclosure: I was an NYPD officer that day, lost two NYPD buddies and my brother-in-law) Did not find this terribly informative and actually quite boring. In lieu of this DVD I would HIGHLY recommend the ""A&E- Investigative Reports"" version, if it ever becomes available."
1,cheap cheap cheap,I was so excited for my charm to come it was a surprise for my husbandWhen the charm came it was unbreakable we could not seperate the two of them. As if they were not cutvery small and scratched up as if someone tried to break apart once before but could notI tried call the customer service number but there was an answering machine never a live person I am still trying to return this itemVery Unhappy..........
4,Makes a Great thing Even Better!,"I thought I had it made when I got the hammock...the pillow makes it ten times better! The pillow makes it easier to roll over and more comfortable - you can't feel the individual strings in the hammock so much but you still get the ""hammock"" feeling. I recommend taking it inside after every use to make it last longer, but it IS weather proof. A must have if you have a hammock."
4,Soft And Smooth,"I bought this pillow because i just got a new hammock for my backyard and i felt it needed one. what else can i say for a hammock pillow? soft, smooth fabric, prefect for those weekend afternoon ""cat naps"""
3,Omni-Swings 'N Things 592 Hammock Pillow-Green,"The pillow is a good size, comfortable and washable. The fabric texture however, is rough next to a soft face."
3,Don't get this if you're getting the 510 Hammock Chair,"I bought this to go along with the Omni-Swings 510 Hammock chair. It's a poor combination, unfortunately. The pillow is actually fairly wide, and the hammock chair is fairly narrow. The pillow really takes up more space than the chair has available (unless you're a fairly small person). Also, the thickness of the pillow pushes the head up too far in the hammock chair.Probably a great product if used in a real hammock, just not worth it in the chair."
1,not what they said,A basic blue oblong pillow arrived at my home. It has no metal eye holes to attach it to the hammock. They are shown it the picture.
2,Just not worth it,"A nice try but just not that useful, I keep finding it falling out and U think it ended up on the couch now."
5,Thanks for the memories...,"My son was four years old and sitting tall on my shoulders when that giant puppet reached down and shook his hand. I will never forget the look of exhuberance on his face, nor will I ever forget the complete feeling of joy I felt with my family all gathered toghether there waiting for the parade. Every time I listen I re-live..."
5,if you were there. . .,"if you were there, you'd understand. . .words cannot express the power of the music in this cd. simply close your eyes, and the music will take you back... to the very spot were you were standing during the parades, whether on the grass or the curbside ... whether you had screaming kids around you or had your love one in hand."
5,Simply AwEsOmE.!,"This Cd is simply a delight to listen to. Being at the Millennium Celebration and hearing the songs, seeing the parades and enjoying the time there. Its all GREAT.! This album helps relive the great times and momories that you have while being there inside all the Disney Magic. Very Reccommended.!"
5,Disney Gets the Gold!,"It is impossible to explain in mere words the breathtaking sights and sounds you can experience at Epcot first hand, during their closing Millennium celebrations. I am so incredibly glad that all the music--in complete form--is available on CD."
5,FAT CD,Tunes that only Disney could produce. Our drive to the Magic Kingdom for GayDay will seem just a little quicker this year.
4,A Great Keepsake After Visiting Walt Disney World,"When I witnessed Millennium Illuminations at WDW in November 1999, I just had to own the music. It's very uplifting and inspiring; also if I'm not mistaken, the music is original. (In the past Disney would mix previous classical music for Illuminations.)It doesn't get five stars because the narrations to Reflections of Earth and Tapestry of Nations are not included. Plus the last two tracks Promise and Celebrate The Future Hand In Hand doesn't hold up very well compared with the other tracks. They're somewhat wishy-washy, but still OK to listen to."
4,Disney Does it Again,"The Millenium CD contains some beautiful music, but I must admit, I was slightly disappointed in the content. ""We Go On"" and ""Celebrate the Future..."" sound very similar to the generic ""female singing the melody"" Disney songs such as ""Remember the Magic,"" etc. The instrumental Reflections of Earth and Tapestry of Nations, though, are beautiful. I get chills down my spine when I hear the music and think of myself standing in Epcot in front of Spaceship Earth. And I haven't seen the Millenium celebration yet. If you have seen the celebration, this CD will definitely stir your emotions and re-create your trip to the World."
1,seeing double,look more than cheap.. not focusing well and besides seeing double.. do not buy this item.. if you want want a cheap pair of binos buy tasco
3,ok for the price,"Used it to see wildlife.It was good at seeing out to distances and its compact size keeps luggage weight down.Downsides are that my son broke it after 2 days,and with a smaller lens opening you lose colors especially on cloudy days."
1,I do not recommend them.,I bought these binoculars for my wife for bird watching. The unit does not focus well and the field of view is not good. I do not recommend them.
4,Archie,I looked for this book for years. Very happy with its condition when it arrived. I am almost done reading this book. Thank you.
5,A Winner,"There is not many children CDS that can keep the attention of adults for a long period of time. This CD has it all, a relaxed styled but also a pop flavor to it. Children and adults can both enjoy listening to this CD. The CD has a good mixture of popular children songs.You will not go wrong with this CD."
2,Get the real thing,"BB is a great blues performer, but his jump blues doesn't jump. Buy some actual Louis Jordan recordings, and really go for it!"
4,Great Tribute,"This is a fine tribute by one of the greatest, B.B. for one of the greatest, Louis Jordan. As much as I enjoy B.B.'s laid back treatment of Louis Jordan's material, I still prefer the originals simply due to the exciting peak performances of LJ's early recordings. They were so full of life. B.B. may be past his peak but he still chimes in with a fine tribute that highlights a very tight band featuring the great David ""Fathead"" Newman on Tenor Sax."
5,B.B. salutes the a swinging style of Louis Jordan -- Great!,"Seems like an unusual choice for BB King to do an entire tribute album to another artist. But it's clear that BB feels strongly about Louis Jordan's contribution to music and he's put together a great collection of songs. BB's focus here is more on vocals than guitar (although there's plenty of that too!), and he's captured the swinging vibe of Jordan's music yet kept things distinctly BB King. The band is great, Dr. John on piano is terrific. Overall, a great album -- and if you like it make sure to check out the original material by the King of Swing himself!"
5,One of B.B.'s best album!,"Undoubtedly,one of the best blues albums of this year!Primorous work of a giant man! B.B.King is one of that kind of musician that become so best as he become so older,like matured wines! His voice is so melodical,intense and pure in this album,that the only thing we can do is to thanksgive this genial bluesman!And what a band! All of the tracks are romantical,intense,......... so this title must be at any bluesfan collection!"
1,Beware - Only works on very old O/S,I bought this assuming it would work with either our 2-yr old Windows PC or our 2-yr old or 5-yr old Macs -- It was only compatible w/ Windows 95 or extremely old Mac O/S and would not work with any of our computers. Worthless and extremely disappointing to my 7-yr old. Beware!!!
3,"Read, Write & Type","Like most keyboarding games, it does poorly at teaching touch typing--less than a quarter of the time spent with the program is actual practice, and only ongoing rhythmic practice will build the necessary motor skills. Doesn't allow repetition of exercises until a skill is mastered. OK as frosting, but not highly nutritious. Needs intensive adult supervision for it to be a meaningful educational experience. Most kids don't have the kind of self-monitoring needed to make this an independent learning experience."
4,In The Biz,"As a (small time) decorator of Night-clubs in England, this book has proved itself valuble when inspiration has been low. There is a good cross section of examples shown from across the world, with many well printed colour photos. The problem with decorating clubs (by that I mean paint effects and murals), is that whats ""in"" changes so frequently that this book will soon be out of date as a source of reference, alternatively if its a nice coffee table book with pictures of fantasy interiours thet you want, then well I've seen worse."
2,Good effort - but not quite there,"This book is a ""pop up"" book and it tears very easily as those toddler hands flash out and grab things. Other pop up books are a bit more resistant, but these are delicate."
5,Believable and Fun,I loved both of Ms. Grimes books and I'm amazed that she hasn't written any others? Where are you? I live in Sacramento and work for the State and my oh my I know the people she works with!
3,Just average...,"Maybe I was expecting too much based on the other novels but this volume of the Mary Russell series did not do anything for me. I cannot put my finger on it but it seemed flat and devoid of any intersting plot twists. None of charaters were particularly engaging including Mary and Holmes.Don't misunderstand me, I will be reading at least one more book in the series to see if this was just an exceptionally weak episode in an otherwise facinating series."
3,"Interesting, but only because I love Holmes and Russell","Oh wouldn't it be wonderfule if the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th books by an author are worthy of the first. I fell in love with Holmes 20 years ago when I read my first Holmes novel. I fell in love again with Holmes and with Mary when I read ""The Beekeepers Aprentice"". The next two books were very, very good and I hope her next lives up to the first. O Jerusalem, while interesting, was just not up to par."
3,Mysterious travelogue,"This story is full of Romantic lore and incidents, and fascinating history from the British conquest of Palestine, but lacks sustained and clever Sherlockian deduction a la Conan Doyle. But then, King is not writing in the Holmes pastiche genre but in her own style. We don't get the traditional explanations of Sherlock's brilliant ratiocination (which is a bit thin and sparse here), because Holmes' assistant, young Mary Russell, is no befuddled Dr. Watson (although still usually a step behind). Old Holmes himself has lost much of his original icy insight and arrogance. This is bad or good, depending on how much you seek a difficult mystery with clues, or an exotic setting and budding romance. Actually, Russell seems a bit of a supernumerary-with-attitude, rather than an intellectual counterpoise to Sherlock here, and the tension between them is not particularly romantic. The final unmasking of the master villain is almost an afterthought."
1,does not live up to king's previous efforts,"o jerusalem fails to live up the high standards of king's previous works.the book actually doesn't start until page 180 or so.it seems that king has difficulty in arriving at a conclusion, and the one she did decide on was without flair. dullis how i judge o'jerusalem--but i will continue to be a king fan and look forward to her next book. hopefully it will be up to her standards."
3,O Dear!,"I LOVED the first two books of the Mary Russell-Sherlock Holmes series. I didn't like the third (A Letter from Mary) but things were looking up in #4 (The Moor), despite the fact that it was the Hound of the Baskervilles II. But try as I might I simply cannot get engrossed in this book!O Jerusalem takes place chronologically in the midst of the first book, The Beekeeper's Apprentice, when Russell and Holmes were still in the process of getting to know each other. To protect themselves, the two go off to Palestine with the assistance of Sherlock's older brother, Mycroft. In Palestine, Russell and Holmes meet several British spies, encounter the Holy Land, and solve some dark political problems.Russell is occupied during most of the novel either deploring the dirt and smells or fighting for respect from their two closest companions, Mahmoud and Ali. The whole thing left me cold, and I am not encouraged that the forthcoming book in the series is more of the same."
1,Not for Sherlock Holmes Fans,Just another Sherlockian Pastiche that will disappear into the abyss of other poorly written pastiches. The only crime here is that this is one of a series that doesn't seem to end. Fans of Sherlock Holmes would find their money better spent elsewhere.
2,This book is as dull as dishwater.,"How sad that the author of the truly wonderful ""The Beekeeper's Apprentice"" is reduced to writing pedestrian fiction like this. Frankly, none of the books that King has written since ""The Beekeeper's Apprentice"" has come close to the high level of quality that she achieved with that book. The characters and the plot in ""O Jerusalem"" are dull and the relationship between Russell and Holmes is extremely underwritten. Gone is the wit and the humor that I loved in the first book of the series. I finished the whole book, but it was a struggle."
5,When is the next one coming!?!,"At first I did not like this book because of the tenson of Ali &Mahoud and Russell & Holmes. But it got better and better as the book went on. I liked it when the ""blood insult"" happened because it showed that there was a bond between the four. I did not think this book had too much description so that you got totally lost. And now I refer to my earlier question, when is the next one!"
3,"For me, too much historical information.",The historical data overpowered the story. It seemed as though the book could be classified non-fiction in that regard.I never had that feeling after reading all Laurie King's previous novels
4,"vivid, imaginative, well worth reading","Great cast of characters, wonderful history, and the scenery comes alive before your eyes. I recommend this book!"
5,Mystery and adventure in the grandest style of intrigue.,"Laurie King say or may not be popular among traditional Sherlockians, but she sure knows how to tell a story. The interweaving of the traditional Sherlock and the clever and witty Mary Russell with the introduction of Mahmoud and Ali is top flight adventure. Let us hope that there are more Sherlock/Mary books in the works and I'd like to see Mahmoud and Ali as well. Well done, Laurie."
1,"Read the Real thing,He's so much better than this tripe.","Just discovered this over the christmas holidays whilst looking for something to read. (small resort town with not much to choose from and I'd finished all I'd bought with me).If you haven't read any Sherlock Holmes then please (I implore you) charge into his adventures. This politically correct and frankly tedious book is not a patch on the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's wonderful adventurer's (Holmes and Watson). First off,nothing happens. A good portion of the book wandering about the desert in a woman's head with the odd description of Sherlock Holmes does not a great mystery make. If anything good has come out of this it's that I'm off to reread the originals."
3,O Jerusalem,Interesting details about the city but the story line is slow to develop. Good to read before a visit to the City. Abrupt ending.
1,The worst mystery I've ever read,"Call me old fashioned but I'd like to see some explanation at the end of a story about why the evil-doer did it. While the descriptions of the situation in Palestine right after the transition from Turkish to British rule were interesting, and the characters were fairly well drawn, it was NOT a mystery as that term is traditionally used. Apparently Ms. King's newest Mary Russell novel answers a few of the questions left hanging in this one, but that is only a device to sell books and not appropriate for a mystery."
1,Lots of Filler,"This book was written as if the author was being paid by the word. Take out the filler and you have a short story fit for one of the romance magazines. If you prefer Favio as your Sherlock Holmes this is for you. Every author is entitled to attempt to write one Sherlock Holmes ""copy."" Laurie King is making a career out of another authors characters."
2,If you're looking for Holmes....,"You won't find him here. I enjoyed the other Holmes novels by King but felt that they missed the mark when attempting to capture the essence of the man. This book went even farther afield and, while well written to be sure, was nevertheless a persistent disappointment to the end. My advice to Ms. King would be to either concentrate on the historical Holmes or to change the name of her series to 'The continuing travels and exploits of Mary Russell.' She might attract fewer readers but it would be more honest."
4,"Excellent read, not quite up to par with BEEKEEPER'S","I've been reading along with the Mary Russell books from the beginning, after being intrigued by a review of THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE, and promptly reading each one of the others as it came out. I have enjoyed every single one of them, though somehow, none of the later books were quite as good as the first, and A LETTER OF MARY was my least favorite of the series. O JERUSALEM has some of the qualities of the first book (e.g. their earlier, non-romantic relationship), but not the spark that made the first one one of my all-time favorite books. The story is a little bit lacking in places, as the author concentrates more on Jerusalem then on the characters. I will always look forward to new books in this series, and wistfully hope with each addition that King will somehow regain that special something."
2,Not as good as the others,"This book was disappointing. If I were not a fan of the series, I probably would have put it down. Holmes and Russell are engaging as always but the mystery is weak and at times boring."
2,Not worth the money.,"Unless you are a huge fan that needs all DKL releases, pass this up. It is an EP with only a few songs. There is a GNR cover song, and some tunes that previewed their newest full-length. Buy ""Of Vengeance and Violence"" instead, and download ""It's So Easy."""
2,Where is the spider?,"I got this book for my baby daughter because she loves the song. I figured the spider would be fairly prominently placed in the illustrations. Yes, it is there, but really really tiny. The goose, instead fills most of the picture.Also, if you plan to do the hand signs while you read/sing the text, the really short phrasing on each page makes it very hard -- because just when you'd want to do the hand sign; ""rain"" for example... you're supposed to be turning a page... down came the rain (turn) and washed the spider out (turn)I also don't like the extra ""Again"" they paste onto the end of the song. ""Climbed up the spout again"" and then there is an additional paged that says ""Again.""I don't think it was worth the money, and I wish I hadn't purchased this version."
2,Advanced and technical,"I am just a patient with dythemia, hoping to learn more, but this book is really useful, I think, to only doctors because of all the technical and medical language which I can't translate. I'm sure it's a good book for those in the field, but not for the layperson."
3,Not the first metalcore album,"The guy below me is very uninformed or just doesn't listen to that much music. Prayer for cleansing and this good album tey've done can be considered ahead of their time by mixing the American hardcore breakdowns with the Gothenburg melodic death metal sound but they still did not do it first. They were plenty of bands out before them playing a veery metalcore sound like Zao, Embodyment, Converge, and Undying for example. Prayer for cleansing might be the first metalcore that had a more melodic death metal influence but they still were not doing any of it first. Still if you like Undying, Converge, As Hope Dies, Darkest Hour, Unearth, Between The Buried and Me, or anything that has a melodic yet brutal sound with hardcore roots then you will definately dig this album."
4,amazing,there is no words for explain the main messaje inside of this book and there isn't time for to try to go beyond of the limits of the life.
3,ehh..,Some of the scents weren't smells I would want to use -- others very pleasant. In the future I would just go to the local heathfood store and choose one kind I know I like for cheaper.
2,Good deal just for the price... way too artificial scent,"I purchased this set with Pearlessence Spa Mist Air Therapy Fountain Mister.I thought it's too good to be true if I got 6 oils for that price.Actually, it was fair enough for the price.Though I love the concept, and I really like how the humidifier works.the oil pack didn't work for me.Each oil smells too artificial. It almost smells like car freshener dangling from back mirror ...If you are expecting aromatherapy, I recommend to pay little bit morefor pure botanical essential oils."
2,Don't be confused!,"These are not essential oils...although the impression they give is they are. These are just like air fresheners and the other things you can buy that also fall into the ""not pure essential oils"" category. Granted, if you wanted to give them as a gift to someone who didn't really care, the price is right. But for the true aromatherpist, these don't fly. It's products like these that have given the term ""aromatherapy"" a bad reputation, becoming know as just ""stuff that smells good"" which is not what aromatherapy is about."
2,DIDNT CARE FOR THEM,"I HONESTLY DIDNT CARE FOR THESE, I WAS THINKING THEY WOULD HAVE A LASTING SMELL, BUT FOR ME THEY ONLY LAST MAYBE 20 MINS. I WILL NOT BE BUYING THESE AGAIN. I WILL STICK TO THE BATH AND BODY WORKS ONES."
3,Lovely yes but not essential and not the best price,"Mauviel molds are certainly of excellent quality. However search for canele molds and you will find far better pricing. As for those who say this is the only way to make true canele, they are mistaken. Superb canele are baked in silicone molds. Fantes has fair prices on silicone. JB prince on copper molds.[...]"
1,Sticky,The canelles I have made twice with these molds have stuck both times. The mini-bundt non-stick pans I used from Wal-Mart did a much better job. While the canelles tasted delicious they looked awful.
2,Meh,"Wouldn't purchase this brand again. Many other ingredients besides just the E oil. it's very thin and watery, too. I'm used to thick vitamin e oil."
4,All Natural?,Chose this rating because it had a fragrance and some items on the bottle which I could not pronouce. I wanted a all natural Vitamine E for my skin.
3,Very oily...,Even for an oil product. I might wear it to bed but never outdoors. Makes my skin looks greasy BUT it works well as a makeup remover.
4,Good price,Used these to prevent scarring from an acid burn I incurred. Helped a bit and the twist off tops were a nice feature.
3,pretty good,"The price was good and the product worked for what I needed it for. I used it for a single bike ride at night and was sort of annoyed that I couldn't get the headlight strapped tight enough on the handlebars, so every so often I would have to grab it and re-aim the light while I was riding. Also, the taillight was missing the cover when I received it from Amazon. I didn't have time to return it and get a replacement, and it still works fine. Can't speak to the brightness of the light as we rode at dusk and not after it got really dark."
4,LED bike lights,"Not the brightest lights that you'll find, but they are what I needed and the price was reasonable."
4,"Good, front light could provide more illumination","This is a fairly simple and effective set of bike lights to help you be seen on the road. It's very easy to install, and use. The one problem I have with it is that the front light's focus is too small. In order to illuminate a decent distance ahead, I have to leave a large portion of the ground right in front of the bike unilluminated, and the total power of the front light is a bit low (with brand new batteries)."
3,Not worth 30 bucks,These are worth half the price. The front headlight doesn't really stay on our bike handle without slipping all the time.
3,Just fine for regular commute,"The tail light is fine, but the clamp for the headlight didn't fix onto the handlebar properly and when the beamer is put onto it, the clamp moves up and down due to the weight of the beamer.I also couldn't remove the clamp to fix it right. It stays in place if the clamp is held with one hand on it while riding the bike. I think it's okay for the price that it's being sold for."
4,"Great value, nice featured light set.","This set uses normal AA and AAA batteries, unlike other sets out there.Beamer 1 (front): Easy to mount to handlebars with included mount. Also easy to remove as a flashlight. Uses two included AA batteries.Blinky 3 (rear): Excellent rear light with 3 LEDs. Uses two included AAA batteries. With included mounts, it attaches to the seat post or to a thin rear frame. Unlike the front light, the rear acts as a reflector when turned off. When you want to remove it for security, it's just a click and a slide, and it turns into a clip light, similar to a belt clip.For some reason, one click on the front light sets it to blink, and two clicks is a steady light. It's the opposite for the rear light. Oops!"
3,Just ok,The light is not bright as I thought. Also the front beamer is not easy to install on bike.I could make a better one with 29 bucks.
3,"Decent, not great","The back mount is fine & was easy to install, the front mount is just poorly designed (& I'm fairly handy). The headlight isn't very bright, but serves well in a safety capacity for being seen by motorists. Both quick-detach mechanisms seem to work well for removing the lights from their mountings."
4,good produsct.,havent tried on bike yet but good quality materials. i would buy again just from that. fast service. a little smaller than i thought but then again it goes on a bike. !!
5,bike light,Love it. it lights up the road enough for me to see a little more clearly and the flashing option makes the people in cars actually a little more aware of my presence.
5,planet bike beamer 1 and blinky 3 led bike light set.,"i wanted a light set for my bike.to be seen by all the vechiles on the roads.this set was easy to put on my bike.the lights do flash very good,the lights makes my bike a eye catcher,the kids who see the lights on at night,think the light set is so cool. the price is fair.i rate the light set a 5 stars. i also so brought a extra pair."
5,Does its Job,I enjoy this combo set. It works well and for the price one can not go wrong. I would recomend it to others.
3,Help for your decision,"Up front, a large disclaimer - I do not own this product, and gave it 3 stars as a 'guessed at' rating.So why am I writing a review? Well, I thought I'd pass along a very helpful bit of information I received while I debated between this bike light set and a similar, more expensive one from Planet Bike also offered by Amazon. This light set includes the Beamer 1 headlight, while the more expensive one features the 1/2 watt Blaze headlight (also from Planet Bike). In reading the reviews I saw where people had said the Beamer 1 was a bit dim, but that didn't clarify things for me.What I'd recommend is to go over to the Planet Bike web site and fire up their 'See the Light' feature, [...]. This very helpful web page shows you *exactly* how each of the different products work, and the area they illuminate."
3,"Versatility and value, but not a great performer.","The bar isn't set very high for a multifunction light set priced under $25, but this set does rise above mediocrity in a couple of important areas. There is a lot of versatility, with both lights having multiple functions and the headlight sharing a LED and a regular bulb with low and high power settings. It is also well designed and made for this price point. But the performance of the headlight is a constant reminder that you didn't pay a lot. Only the highbeam is useable when riding at night and it likes batteries. Really, really likes batteries. After just 1.5 hours of night riding the range and intensity of the high beam has been cut by more than half.My local bike shop offered this set for $15 when I bought my bike, so I really don't have anything to complain about considering I've spent more on a pizza. But the battery consumption has put a rechargeable headlight high on my shopping list."
3,ok lights,the front light seems too big to fit on my (normal sized) handlebars and was confusing to put on. the back light is fine
4,bike light for the ride home,I bought this light set because it was the combo of both front and rear lights. I have an adult trike and the rear light attached easily to the rear basket though I had to put it sideways instead of the intended direction...no biggie for me. The front loop took a little figuring out....much easier to put on in the daylight then at night but that is entirely my fault. The front light is bright but could never be used at a headlight. It works well as dusk which is about as late as I ride my trike.
2,It get's the MEH.,"Headlight is dim, and the clamp sucks. The tail light rock though. I would suggest buying that by itself. Don't get this headlight."
2,Headlight simply too dim.,"The rear light on this set is good and very visible, but the headlight is simply too dim to be any good for lighting the road or being seen by oncoming traffic, even when blinking. The Cateye EL135N/LD130 set is cheaper and the headlight is very good.Cateye EL135N/LD130 Head Light and Rear Light"
3,attention getter,have on front as strobe only and with cat eye lights for majority of light. seemed weak for light alone but strobe can be seen way out from other vehicles. good for rear flashers also as most bikers HIT FROM BEHIND.
2,"Good lights, awful mounts","Firstly, the lights are very powerful. The 3 LED blinker is much brighter than others I see on the road, it really makes you stand out. The same is true of the ""beamer"".However, the mounting mechanisms for both these products are a disaster. The clip on the 3 LED blinker is incredibly weak, I can't even get it to stay attached to a backpack strap and it is much too small to clip onto any part of my bike's frame. The lamp's mechanism is an even greater nightmare. It's unreasonably difficult to open the clasping mechanism and once you do open it, you realize that it is also way too small to attach to any useful part of your bike.Really, really poor design using good off the shelf electronics. I have ended up taping the lamp to my helmet at night and I have yet to use the blinker as it falls off of everything I clip it to."
2,"Worth the money, but poorly designed.","The headlight works fine, however there are two weird aspects to this design. First, it didn't fit the handlebars on either of my two bikes. Either it was too tight or too loose. I had to build up the handlebars to the perfect diameter with some gaff tape before the headlight would snap on and stay put. Second, who thought that the default headlight mode should be a low-frequency strobe? I can't ride with a blinky headlight. You will find yourself clicking through the modes to the always-on mode. This is crazy. Regular headlight mode (continuous light) should be the default, and seizure-inducing strobe mode should be the second option.After I dialed it into the right node, the headlight optics proved bright and surprisingly tight. It makes a nice, even white spot on the ground."
5,Now everyone can see me. The light is bright and easy to install.,"Love this light, it is easy to install, bright and makes me visable to cars in the dusk. I would recomend it to anyone who rides when the sun starts to set."
3,Not as smooth as the one your doctor uses,"I like the idea of this thermometer and will continue to use it, except it doesn't glide across the forehead like the one your doctor uses. The temperature can be recorded differently each time because it is affected by when you push the start button, whether or not you lift it off of the forehead, etc."
4,Overall it's a good alternative,"Well, once we couldn't measure temperature any other way, I had to go with this one. Overall tip is ti measure temp many times, and take the highest as a clue. Not that it's not accurate, it's just hard to hold it the right angle, and move it, and keep your kid still. But I'm glad I have it, helps to know where we stand."
1,Digital Themometer wins out.....,"My sons new peditrician uses the professional version of this thermometer and even that one at a price tag of $400 and a trained nurse behind it did not pick up my five year olds 105.8 degree temp! I took him in after my welch allyn sure temp (another professional themometer)gave me the high reading when they took his temp they said he no longer had one I begged to differ, a mom uses a themometer only to confirm what she 90% of the time already knows: her child has a fever and is ill! I happened to have my themometer with me, along with all his medications and when the nurse took it again on my request with my digital themometer it once again read 105.8! I had considering purchasing one of the home use ones but if the doctors fancy exspensive one does not work why would the cheaper version be any better?"
1,Big Mistake!,"I thought this was a great concept but what a big mistake buying it! It is NOT accurate. I've read the directions and watched the cd it comes with but it is not accurate. The thermometer was reading my son's temp. to be 98 degrees, when I did a rectal- cause I knew it was above normal- it was 104! I sent the thermomter back to the company and they sent me a new one- maybe a defect- but this one is going back as well! I want my money back and stick to what works- the digital ear thermomters!!"
2,not a great value,"unfortunately, i diagree with the other reviewers on this thermometer. my husband and i both agree that other thermometers give more accurate readings. it is a nice product if it were consistent. our nurse on our exit interview even said to return it-but one for [money] that will work just as well, and go out to dinner with all the money we saved--she was right."
1,This thing is a waste!,"We thoguht this would work and if it had, it would've been fantastic, but it is highly uaccurate. Get an under arm thermometer. The doc told us that was the best anyway!"
1,"Eenie, meanie, miney, mo...pick a number, any number...","I was so excited about this thermometer for several reasons, but its inconsistent performance leaves me no choice but to return it to the store. My wrist, cheek and palm give me as much confidence in my child's temperature as this thermometer. Yes, he feels hot, but is it enough to require medicine or should I just let the fever do its job? Oh well, I thought it was too good to be true. If you decide to buy it, I hope you have a 5 star experience. Better yet, I hope it's like an insurance policy that you'll never need."
1,Not at all helpful - very disappointed!,"This thermometer may be acurate, but it is impossible to take a reading unless your child is sleeping. I don't know about you, but I want to know my son's temperature BEFORE he goes to sleep so that if he's running a fever I can medicate him. I don't want to wait until he's asleep to find out that he needs medicine and then have to wake him up again! I didn't use it when he was an infant because all the books (and my doctor) stated that rectal temperature was the only one to use. Now that he is 11 months old, he is WAY too active to attempt this typle of reading...I'll be returning it for an ear thermometer. By the way, my doctor's office still uses the ear thermometers so they can't be THAT bad!"
1,non shipment,This product was never received. Company did not respond to my request: Where ismy merchandise ? Money was credited to my charge card. End of story. JJW
1,Is this a joke or bad luck??,"I looked very much forward to my new thermometer. Living as an expat, working in Venezuela and having waited about 3 weeks for delivery, I finally recived it. I opened up the package, bragging for my wife what a good thing this was for our newborn. I expertly slid the back cover open with my thumb,and proceeded to install the battery - when suddely the positive battery reciver snapped off from the card it was soldered on to. What a joke. It took me 5 seconds to destroy the theromoeter. Lesson learned.... take it easy when installing the battery or you""ll se your $50 fly out the window pretty quick.This part of the thermometer likely needs some QA work. It is not easy to slide the battery in. The pos and neg recivers in the thermometer are very stiff.Be careful or buy something else for your $50."
3,"great idea, but poor accuracy","i was so excited to buy this thermomether, as finally, i hoped, no need to use rectal.. Well, it still does not replace the traditional method. One time it shows 100, next second 98, and it can go on forever. My sister, who is an MD, tried it, and she got different readings too. Well, she knows where this arthery is, doesn't she?In other words, it gives you an idea of a baby's fever, but to be certain, one still has to use ""normal"" thermomether. On the other hand, it is easy to use, but then again, what is the point, if it is not accurate...Buy it if you take your baby's temperature often, but otherwise stick to rectal - it is a pain to use, but at least you get a reliable reading."
5,Just like the Professionals,"My son was recently sick with a high fever and when we went to the doctors office, they used a temporal artery thermometer. I told my husband about it when I got home and he said, ""lets get one"". Of course I thought that this was something that would cost hundreds of dollars so I didnt really think that was possible. That afternoon, I was reading a Parenting magazine and saw an article that compared all the types of thermometers and they showed this one as the top choice. I was pleasantly surprised when it said the average price was $50!!! I jumped right on the computer and ordered it immediately. We have been very pleased with it so far. Its simple to use and very accurate. If you have small children or even if you dont, its such a great product to have in every household!!!"
1,inconsitent,"I bought this thermometer because of all the wonderful reviews, but I have yet to get the same reading twice. I have tried it on myself and the baby and it doesn't matter how many times I try, I never get close to the same reading twice. I also got the error message several times. For the price I expected much better."
3,Not accurate,"I got this thermometer thinking it would be the best. Especially after reading all of the reviews. The thermometer isn't very accurate. I can take my baby's temperature several times simutaneously at the same place and get a different reading each time. It is very easy to use, just not accurate."
4,So far so good.,This seems accurate. I did a scan and compared to rectal - and it was the same! So far so good.
2,Not as easy as it looks,"I ended up returning this thermometer after trialing...did not get consistent readings & felt unsure of how to use it. I watched the video online & thoroughly read the directions...but, I am looking for consistency/accuracy in readings - which I did not find. I am sure it works for others, but it wasnt what I was looking for."
1,"very bad quality, doesn't work properly",it never showed correct temperature. It is so inconvinient to use. I returned it back to the store
1,Inaccurate at Best,"My husband and I are expecting our first child in about a week. We wanted to make sure we found a trustworthy thermometer that was, well, less invasive than the traditional thermometer. After hearing that the ear thermometers don't always work for young children, this seemed to be the perfect solution. Unfortunately, this one doesn't work either. After reading all the directions over and over again, we were unable to get a constant reading twice in a row when we tried to read our own temperatures. The temps would vary a couple of degrees between readings. Those 2 degrees can make a big difference when a child is sick."
5,SIMPLE AND SIMPLY THE BEST,"Our Pediatrician has been using the Exergen Professional model for several years now, and I could not believe it when it became available to the public. I purchased the Exergen Thermometer last week when I thought my 7 month had felt warm. I used the digital under his arm, but I truly don't think you get an accurate temperature. And even though this is my fourth son, I still don't like taking rectal temperatures! I opened the package and went around the house taking everybody's temperature!! So easy, quick and accurate. I read other reviews stating they had a difficult time if the child is moving...what thermometer is easy with a wiggly child? Certainly not rectal or under the arm, and oral always winds up in the wrong spot--and they all take too long to register. Well, now I know, the Exergen is the easiest--with a sleepy child or wiggly child! Wish they had made this when my others were little. Great idea; great product!"
5,Inexperience may cause poor reviews,"My pediatrician's office uses this thermometer. It takes experience to use it correctly to make sure it is positioned correctly. I don't doubt that most of the poor reviews are due to inexperience on the user's part, not on the part of the product. I use it at home and love it. If you read the literature that comes with the product, you'll note that it is more accurate than an ear scan thermometer. I think it is quick, easy and a no-brainer...buy this, you'll love it!"
4,I like it!,"This is a pretty good thermometer. I use it as a estimate...if my little one does have a high fever, I will verify it with my rectal thermometer. It's usually not more than half a degree off, but I still check it. My dad has had issues getting an appropriate temp, but you have to hold the sensor flush with the skin and scan it all the way to the hair line. If you follow the instructions, it is pretty accurate. I love having it to do quick checks on my 1 year old when she isn't feeling well...."
5,The absolute BEST,"We LOVE LOVE LOVE this thermometer. Our 2-year-old loves it and thinks its a toy. Taking her temp. when she is sick and cranky has become 1000X's easier. She loves the ""take your temperature"" game. The best money we have EVER spent!!!"
5,Great.,"Much more accurate than the ear thermometer that we could never calibrate. Each time we test it, it seems to be the same temp."
1,"Not a good choice, though easier!","I bought this because I saw so many great reviews for it and thought it would be much easier than taking my 1-year-old's temperature by ear or rectally. I thought, at first, that we were getting accurate readings. I tested myself with it, and then with an oral thermometer and got similar results.But, 2 weeks ago when my daughter felt warm, it read that she was only at 98.8. Shortly thereafter, she had a febrile seizure. We checked her temperature rectally and it was 103.5. I would NOT recommend using this thermometer!Today I've been feeling a bit under the weather, and I checked my temperature orally and it is 101.5, and with this thermometer it reads 97.5.Batteries are new. Pediatricians recommend rectal temperature taking, and I definately agree."
5,Amazing... simply amazing.,"I bought this thermometer after reading some of the reviews and I couldn't agree more that this is the best thermometer out in the market. It's quite expensive compared to the others, but well worth the money. I used it on my 3 month old after she had her vaccinations. She felt warm, and was quite fussy. This thermometer let me take her temperature quickly without disturbing her. You can take multiple readings in a matter of seconds. I've tested it on her, myself, and my husband. I've used the ear and the armpit thermometers and none of them can compare to this one. It will be my standard baby shower gift from now on!"
2,Not Happy,"I thought this was the thermometer to get since we have an infant. Taking temperature at the ear is inaccurate the first three months. When trying this temporal thermometer it read the room temperature accurately(it matched our programmable thermostat). When taking temperature of people it indicated 95.7 or 96.0 degrees F. Never any higher. Read through the instructions and they mentioned sweating being an issue. We weren't sweating but it was 75 degrees in the room. Whether humidity was an issue we don't know. Not being able to take your temperature because you're sweating was good enough reason to send it back. If someone in my house is sweating due to illness and not because of ambient temperature, I'll use the rectal method for the baby's first three months then use the ear canal digital type thereafter."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"After reading the reviews here I bought one of these units for my son hopeful it was the best thing on the market. Wrong! The temperature reads were inconsistent. I got a different read every time I scanned! When I returned it to my local babies r' us store the sales person at the return desk said this used to be a good item, but they had received a lot of returns - there must be a bad batch out there. Buyer be warned! I picked up a Braun digital ear thermometer and I'm completely happy with its accuracy."
2,Not so happy,So far I am not thrilled with this product. Each time I take a reading it comes back different than the last one with large jumps in tempatures. It does not seem dependable.
2,Not very accurate,This device is easy to use and non-invasive but it is extremely difficult to get an accurate reading. Using it several times on the same patient can give a wildly different range of temperatures.
3,"Great for getting a ballpark idea, but not for times of sickness","This product is great for getting an idea of a range of temperature, but isn't very good for times of sickness. I'd recommend sticking with a rectal thermometer when little one is sick."
4,so much easier,My little one HATES having his temp. taken so this makes it so much easier. I feel it's pretty accurate and gets the job done quickly.
2,Not reliable,Im sure it is a great product but despite reading instructions I can't seem to get the same reading on temp twice. Really wish I can return it but apparently I only had 30 days to do so.
1,Not at all accurate,The readings from this thermometer are so varied that it's pretty useless. You can get variations from 98.6 to 101 on the same person over just a few swipes. I thought temporal thermometers were the best but this one is junk.
1,Really inconsistent,"I have never written a review in my life, but I had to because this product was pretty awful. I have to say this was a really dumb purchase. It is super inconsistent, even when I am using it on my own head. When you have a newborn or an infant, you want the thermometer to be as accurate as possible, because a reading of 100.4 could have you going to the doctor or emergency room. This product is woefully inaccurate and I wouldn't take my chances. Even though a rectal thermometer is not my idea of a good time, I'd rather know that the reading is as accurate as it can be. Save your money and do not buy this product."
1,Inconsistent at best,"I liked the idea of being able to just swipe this across the forehead and be done. The problem is that unless you go perfectly across the forehead at just the right speed and angle, you get an error. I have had slightly better results doing it behind the ear or on the neck. When I can get a reading, it is in credibly inconsistent, and I can have three different readings separated by as much as two degrees. Not helpful!"
4,Nice product,"I got this one for the first time based on reviews, and i would say it lived up to my expectations.Just 1 small issue which i faced like i have a baby who is 6 months old, whenever he use to have fever and while he is sleeping i use to rubb this device on his forehead which kind of use to make him uncomfortable :-) Again this is something not a too big of a issue."
2,Did not give consistent readings.,"I put this on my baby registry after reading all the great reviews here. However, I have never been able to get consistent readings. I can scan 20 times in a row and get a different reading every time. I agree that it seems much easier than a rectal on my baby or even under the arm, but I just don't feel like I can rely on it to give me an accurate temperature reading. I am surprised by the number of people who said they are getting consistent readings. Maybe as a new mom, I am just not as experienced at it. But I guess that is something to take into consideration before you buy."
2,Would not buy,I use this thermometer at work for infants and hate it. You have to go perfectly around the head to the back of the ear or get an error sign. If your child has an extremely high temp it can be off which can be dangerous.
1,I returned it within one day!,"I was one of the unfortunates who had no luck with this what-so-ever and returned it for a refund. It gave different temperatures when used over and over on the same person, with huge temp variations.I went online and watched the tutorial just to see if I was doing it wrong. I bought it to use with my 4 year old and 4 month old so i could accurately take their temps non-invasively. I just bought the Braun ear therm a sit was the only other one at the store so i will give it a try. I did speak with the pharmacist who did say 3 of these were returned this week for the same reason, maybe a bad batch??"
3,User from Washington,If used correctly it will work fine. To use it correctly you have to be careful while taking the temperature. It is very easy not to make a good contact between thermometer head and your skin what will result in much lower reading. My understanding is that it is not important to know is temperature 104.5 or 104.1 but to know is it 100 or 104. So you know to visit doctor or not.
2,Inconsistent Readings,"I'll have to agree with some people on here and say that I keep getting different readings everytime as well. I have never gotten the same reading twice. I read all the great reviews and thought I should register for this one, but when I got it and tried it out numerous times on different foreheads, generally this was pretty inaccurate."
1,Not worth the money,"I received this thermometer at my baby shower and I thought it would be so easy to use. It is easy to use, but the results are worthless. I was told by the doctor that this thermometer doesn't work. He recommends taking it under the arm with a digital, which works much better. I just get my husband to distract my son while I'm doing it. I use the thermometer the hospital gave us when we were discharged. What a disappointment and a waste of money for something I thought would be easier."
1,Not very reliable and very erratic.,I purchased this item to monitor fevers for my baby instead of using a rectal thermometer which I didn't feel comfortable using. The readings I got from it were erratic and I didn't really feel it was worth the money. Though it looks like the maker Exergen has a lot of back up and patents and whatnot I would scan several times and never come up with a reading within a few degrees of another taken a few seconds before! I eventually figured with another thermometer that it was scanning low too which meant it wasn't worth much for me to catch a fever. I got a First Years thermometer for $10 and wish I had bought it before rather than paying $50 for this thing. It was a waste of money.
3,His blood runs cold.....His Angel is a CENTERFOLD!,"Greetings from Tromaville!I got this film free as a gift from Troma. It involves a right-wing religeous nut who kills girls in his centerfold calendar because his finds pornography deplorable.Although this film goes off track on several occations, it is still very enjoyable and worth the cost of purchase. It also contains the trailor for one of Troma's best films: ""Fatty Drives The Bus""."
5,A classic which has launched an important discussion,"This slim volume by Edward Farley has spawned an enormously important literature on theological education. Before this book was written, there was very little specifically theological discussion of what theological education ought to look like. Since its publication, an entire literature has come into being, all of which references this volume. For those who want to understand theological education and how it could and should be reformed, this book is the best place to begin. It richly deserves to be reprinted!"
5,The Best For Last...,"With the recent addition of ""The Distance to Here,"" I now have all of Live's cds and this one is my second favorite. Agreed that it's not as heavy as the other cds, but the softer sense of ""Run to the Water,"" ""Face and Ghost,"" ""They Stood Up For Love,"" and ""Dance with You,"" will leave you with chills. I love Live to death and this cd is definitely a must-have to your colletion."
4,Can't wait to hear it all!,"The fan from Virginia who said that the album sounds like they're trying to spread peace and love rather than make good music needs to get a new brain. I have a 2 yr. old daughter and I would rather have her listen to something that spreads ""peace & love"" than have her hear something that talks about someone killing a child. I haven't heard the whole album yet, but I sure like The Dolphins Cry. I've told my husband that I want that album for x-mas, and so far, reading some of these comments makes me want this album now. I may have to buy myself an early x-mas gift."
4,Excellent relese From LIVE once again....,"Awesome, this CD rocks the house form start to finish. The only song I don't care for is The Distance, best song is #5-Sun, otherwise the rest of the album is excellent.This band gets better with every album, add this one to your collection."
5,Best Album Of Its Kind,"Now for the people saying it wont be a rockers cup of tea... WRONG... Live Distance To Here is one of my favorite cds I own, and I own alot of different ones from slipknot to ozzy to the beatles. This cd I can listen to over and over again, I listen to this when I am depressed(which is alot) and it helps me out of it. This song has some of my favorite songs on it... dance with you has the most beautiful lyrics I have ever heard and it makes me think about myself when I listen to it. All I know is that I love this cd and would not trade it for any other."
5,Grows on you - BIG TIME!,"I heard The Dolphins Cry on the radio and thought it was a great tune, so I bought the album. (I liked Throwing Copper but not Secret Samadhi). I listened to the album once and thought it was OK. It happend to stay in my car's CD player and I ended up giving it a few more listens. Suddenly in the middle of ""Where Fishes Go"" it hit me - THIS ROCKS! Since then this album has grown on me and I can't quit listening to it (I'm listening to it right now). Yeah the lyrics aren't exactly brilliant, but the melodies are and I really dig Ed's vocals. Best tunes on the album: Where Fishes Go, Vodoo Lady, Dance With You."
4,A Good CD for LIVE fans...,"TDTH is a pretty good CD that does the same thing that LIVE's other 3 previous releases did...the more that you listen, the more it captivates you. Seems to be a few more melodic songs on this project than their previous, so to me it leans more towards Throwing Copper. I still have a yearning for the crispness and clean-sound of Mental Jewelry (still my favorite!), but this latest CD is still a must-have!There seems to be a few ""filler"" songs, but it's hard to put out 12-13 ""hits"" on a single CD.My best...Run to the Water, Sparkle, Voodoo Lady, Dolphin's Cry.LIVE will be around for years to come... here's to GOOD LISTENING!"
3,Getting back to the beginning...but not quite there yet.,"When I first heard Mental Jewelry, it didn't take long before I came to regard Live as one of my favorite bands. I saw the boys on their virgin tour and it was as moving a performance as I had seen in a long time. Since then, I feel like Live has been sliding down a slippery slope, especially lyrically. Throwing Copper had a few gems but many of the songs came across as trite. The Distance To Here seems to be an attempt at returning to those original ideas from Mental Jewelry with a more mature eye (these guys are still relatively young.) Some of the tracks succeed nicely. The Dolphin's Cry, Run To The Water, Sun and They Stood Up For Love are reminiscent of the simplicity and honesty that helped define Live in the beginning. Maybe I just need a few more listens, but the guys are getting back to what made them great in the beginning. If nothing else, it's nice to hear a positive message being put out there!"
5,The best of the best!,"I love this cd for 100% logical reasons. Trust me, there is no emotion going into this review. I am as a robot. My opinions are based soley on the skill of the musicians. If you don't love Live yet, I encourage you to listen to this cd a few more times before making any permanent calls on the band. It may sound funny, but one really does need to let the greatness of Live settle in to the brain before it takes affect. Being as a computer, I believe that the lyrics are as superficial as they come, but the music is certainly not! Pick this one up and expose as many people to it as possible. P.S., for those of you who still believe ""Throwing Copper"" is the best of Live, grow up!"
4,Their second best thus far,"Not as good as ""Copper,"" but much better than ""Jewelry"" and ""Samahdi."" ""Distance"" incorporates the best aspects of all three albums into one, very unique sound. The synthesis of Eastern influences and crunch rock make Live stand apart. My favorite songs are ""Dolphin's,"" ""Sparkle,"" and especially ""Quiet River."" And contrary to the Amazon review above, ""shooting star"" is never rhymed with ""you'll go far."""
3,It isn't catchy,"Other than ""The distance"", ""Face and Ghost"", and ""Voodoo Lady"" I couldn't get into this album. Many of the songs sound like main stream arena anthems or rehashed ballads. The lyrics are redundant with repeated reference to either water or the desert sounding over produced and pretentious. The Distance to here doesn't come close to either ""Mental Jewelry"" or ""Throwing Copper"". Quite simply the majority of ""The Distance to here"" is boring and uninteresting."
2,Too Much Distance Between Here and Mental Jewelry,"this disc is a vast improvement over their previous release. unfortunately, the band is still obsessed with covering up their melodic material with distorted guitars and thrashing drums. the second half of the disc salvages a ""rocky"" beginning but it's a shame that this talented band has abandoned the funk and folky elements of their unique debut album."
4,It is a great album,"Live delivers an electric album again. It's passionate, likable, and all around groovy. ""The Dolphin's Cry"" is such a great song, and the rest are solid as well. It is not quite as good as Throwing Copper, but it's darn close!"
4,Good but still not classic Live,"The Distance to here is by far a better album then The Secret Samadhi. Still, my only concern that Live's message in some of the songs tends to be too positive in comparison to their more critical views in Mental Jewerly (classic, Live at its best). I feel Live has strayed from its critical, meaningful view of the world remininiscent from Mental Jewerly or Throwing Copper. My main concern is that The Distance To Here has a little bit of that classic sell out about love and relationships that so many artists perform to death today. Still, the rhythym and sound are excellent. I would recommend buying the CD for a nice listen."
3,I like this Cd,"Some Live Cd's I like, some I don't this one I like. It has four really good songs accompoanied by the rest of the Cd that is all good. Track 1 is probably what most people buy the Cd for. It is ""The Dolphin's Cry"". It is a good song and it was the one that made me get the Cd. Also, ""Run to the Water"", tr5ack 4, is a great song. I like ""Feel the Quiet River Rage"" as well as ""The Distance"". It has enough good songs to keep you listening. I would recommend this to anybody who liked the prior Live Cds as well as Our Lady Peace fans or people who liked the new Filter Cd. Filter has a slightly different style, but trust me on that one if you liked ""Title of Record""."
2,Live = Dead,"I figured Secret Samahdi was an aberration but it turns out that's not the case. This is a dissapointing CD at best. No catchy tunes and although Throwing Copper and Mental Jewelry are fixtures in my CD player, this might lead me to be apprehensive when it comes to buying a Live CD in the future."
1,Dolphins Don't Cry,"Among other things. Ed K. is perhaps the single most annoying lyricist (aside from Alanis)in music today. Too bad, because the music here isn't exactly horrible. It's just hard to overlook the lyrics, which are hokey at best."
2,great music but those lyrics.....,"I recently realized that if someone could just break Ed's fingers so he can't pick up a pen and then give the pen to anybody else to jot down some lyrics, Live wouldn't be a bad band. They write some tremendous melodies and Ed is actually a decent singer other than when he goes over the top and yes, he does that a lot. But damn, who else would have the bad sense to use the word ""placenta"" in a song or wail in a non-fashionable sense about dolphins? Shut up."
1,Do I actually have to give it a star?,"Live? More like....""Who can we copy so we can Millions""? This band just needs to go away....and it looks like they will."
5,Even Better Than Before,"What can you say ? It's Live at their fullest. I have seen them in concert twice in the last couple of months, so i have had exposure to a bit of the new material. The Dolphin's Cry is awesome, Live's lyrical genious shines through. Every once in a while you come across a song that just gives you chills. You can find that here, such as in Run to the Water. I could go on bragging, but it would be like ruining the end of a movie. check out the album, and never miss an opputunity to see the band live."
5,Live is back and as powerful as ever!!,"After buying this long awaited fourth release of Live I can happily say I am not dissapointed. After the 1997 release of the underrated Secret Samadhi you knew that Live needed to pull it together if they were going to stay at the top with the rest of the Rock Gods. The Distance to Here should keep them up there for a while. I see many possible singles that should get the radio play and affection of fans all over the world. ""Sparkle"", ""Run to the Water"" and ""Where the Fishes go"" are a few of the explosive tracks that you better get used to. Add this CD to your collection and support one of the few very good rock bands."
4,Heavier Spiritually,"This CD doesn't really blow me away like Throwing Copper, but several songs do such as THe Dolphin's Cry, Dance with You and Run to the Water. Definately try it, although some lyrics and melodies are strikingly similar to previous songs. .."
4,good stuff,"From all of they hype that this disc has been getting for the past year I expected something akin to Throwing Copper. I wasn't impressed after first listening to the album, but it grew on me after hear it a few times. While this CD is no where near TC caliber, it's still easily one of the best albums to come out this year. Check it out."
4,powerful and another AWESOME Live album,"As always Live pulls through, digs deep and explodes with an awesome cd that holds a very powerful message of love and rebirth. A change from their past albums, but nothing falls short. The sound is awesome, the lyrics powerful, and on the whole, a must buy!"
5,New face of LIVE,"This album is wonderful, w/ peaceful songs and the lyrics are a way to think in life and love."
2,A major disappointment,"This long awaited followup disappointed me greatly. Admittedly I have only had a couple of listens, but none of the tracks jump out at me. Even Samadhi had a few diamonds in the rough. And what's up with the endless water metaphors? Enough already!"
4,Mellow,"While I am a die hard Live fan, when I first bought this I was a little disapointed. All of the songs are much more mellow and relaxed than on their other albums. They still have a lot of energy for a normal rock group, however this is Live and I expected them to hit a little bit harder. But, this new mellower album grows on you. I am sure that with enough time and listening, this will be a solid 5 star album."
4,A good CD from a creative band....,"Live is an exceptional band. I was not disappointed with this CD in any way, though it is not the kind of CD you can listen straight through. The Dolphin's Cry, Sparkle, Run to the Water, Face and Ghost, and They Stood Up for Love are my favorite songs. However, the other songs are kind of a different style of Live, which I still like, but not as much~it's a little heavier and with less of a good melody. All in all, a good purchase."
3,"Good, but a step down","I'm a big Live fan. .... Live is one of my favorite bands because not only do the songs rock, but the lyrics are very powerful and almost resonate in you as you hear Ed singing. But this CD is clearly a step down for the band. The songs still rock, but the lyrics are truly a disappointment for the band. Throwing Copper gave them a big name (although mental jewelry is definitely worth buying) and surprisingly Secret Samadhi was on par if not better than their previous cd. The Distance to Here has good tunes, and that's what many people who give this cd 5 stars are talking about. But, for a Live cd, the songs don't reach you in the same way as the other 3 cd's did. Hard core live fans should buy it, but those who heard dolphin's cry and want to give live a shot should get throwing copper or secret samadhi first."
2,although the first song is good the rest.......,good job on dolphins cry. the rest... WHAT HAPPENED! this is a huge difference from throwing copper and seems to forced.
2,A bit disappointed,"Judging by most of the reviews here, Secret Samadhi s#@ked; however I loved its dark, brooding, twitchy feel (""...this puke stinks like beer...""). It was the first Live CD I ever listened to, given to me by my younger brother (""listen to this - it's cool"").TDTH starts off with the powerful Dolphin's Cry and nothing comes close after that. Sure, there are some good tunes here, Run To The Water and Sparkle come to mind. Honestly, after a dozen times listening to it, I can't remember the names or melodies of the other songs without looking at the liner notes on the CD.Non Live fans who buy this CD on the strength of Dolphin's Cry may be disappointed. For me, Live are capable of much better.2 stars for the music. 5 stars for the CD artwork."
4,A complete Turn around!,"I really didn't like live's cd ""throwing copper"". I think live completly turned around. they were able to produce an all around great cd.This cd is a great buy and worth the money spent. I'm glad I bought this cd and Know that you'd be glad if you bought it too."
3,Eh . . . I expected more,"An uneven effort from Live that fails to expand upon the brilliance of ""Secret Samadi."" Not that there aren't moments of brilliance on this album. ""They Stood Up for Love"" and ""Run to the Water"" have all the elements that marked the greatness of Live's early career. Its just that songs like ""Where Fishes Go,"" ""Face and Ghost (the children's song)"" and ""Voodoo Lady"" just seem to ramble more than they rock. There's none of the fire of ""Lakini's Juice""(from Secret Samadi) and too much of the quasi-religious ramblings they've become known for. All-in-all, a so-so effort from a great band."
3,"Good, but still not their best","Please keep in mind that I have heard this album only twice through. Having said that, my initial impressions are that it is a good album but still not as good as Throwing Copper was, but it is much better than Secret Samadhi. There are a bunch of fine tunes (i.e. The Dolphins Cry, Meltdown, Where Fishes Go, We Walk in the Dream, They Stood Up For Love, etc.) and the album is still worth buying. But, for those of you who want Live's best, buy Throwing Copper or Mental Jewelry."
4,"Great Live CD, but not their best",The Dolphin's Cry: AThe Distance: B+/A-Sparkle: A-/ARun to the Water: B-Sun: AVoodoo Lady: AWhere Fishes Go: AFace and Ghost: C+Feel the Quiet River Rage: AMeltdown: A/A+They Stood Up for Love: B+/A-We Walk in the Dream: B/B+Dance With You: D+/C-Average: B+/A-
4,SOME AWESOME STUFF FROM LIVE,"I LIKED LIVE'S MUSIC BUT I WAS NEVER BEEN A TRUE FAN OF THEM. BUT THIS ALBUM HAS INSPIRED ME A LOT. THIS IS TO ME, THE BEST MUSIC LIVE HAS EVER PRODUCED. WONDERFUL MUSIC, GREAT LYRICS. SONGS LIKE ""DOLPHIN'S CRY"" ""RUN TO THE WATER"" MAKES THIS ALBUM A TREAT TO LISTEN. WHILE "" DANCE WITH U"" ""SUN"" AND "" WHERE FISHES GO"" ARE ALSO WONDERFUL. THE ALBUM REVEALS THE TRUE EMOTIONS OF THE BAND. THE REASON I'M NOT GIVING IT 5 STARS IS THAT THE ALBUM LACKS SOME SLOW TEMPO SOOTHING TRACKS LIKE ""DANCE WITH U"". I WISH I COULD HAVE HEARD ON OR TWO MORE SONGS LIKE THIS IN THE ALBUM BUT I COULD NOT FIND.NEVERTHELESS IT'S A GREAT ALBUM, AND A MUST BUY."
4,a bit of a let down,"Live was one of my first CDs...throwing copper...and I was a fan thru Secret Sambadi...but now, I'm not so sure they're living up to their potentials. Perhaps stardom has gotten in the way of their emotions, but I feel that there are no emotions coming with this CD...whereas their earlier stuff was wonderfully charged with real insight. A still decent album though."
2,only one song really worth it.,"I was very excited to buy the new Live CD, and soon that all evaporated after I played the CD. Their hit-single is the best song on the whole album, and you'd expect that after the long break they've been on, they could come up something a bit stronger than this album. If you're a rock fan, this might not be your picnic."
5,Greatness...and Surpassing it.,"After looking over some reviews here, i have to say that some people are just plain crazy. The Distance to Here is not only a great album, it surpasses the previous king Throwing Copper. Of the albums I own (4 songs, That's Live, Mental Jewelry, Throwing Copper, Secret Samadhi, The Distance to here, the Lakini's Juice single, and ""Walk Into this Room"" from the Playing by Heart soundtrack) the new album is just short of God-like material. I love the funkier roots that they are returning to (remember, that was the original Live). This is definately the most impressing thing i've heard in this decade, and it is the pinnacle of what music should be..."
5,Great Album!!!,"I don't know why people compare this album to the others...People grow and experience new things, that's what any songwriter will write about. I think this album is fantastic. Ed mainly sings about LOVE. Which I personally thought is really cool. The whole band is full of great ideas and this album proves it. Ed's lyrics are beautiful, and chord structures in the songs go together great. It's nice to see good music coming back."
5,"True, Solid, Amazing, Greatness - LIVE has reached the stars","The Distance to Here - whatever that means, right Ed - has pleased this LIVE fan a million times. The songs on the album are touching to the soul and leave you feeling like there is a band out there who can positively reach out and touch everyone of their fans individually. LIVE has been my favorite band since I first heard of them in 1994 and have been lucky enough to see them perform in Boston, London, and just this past week at their two shows in San Francisco. After these five years I also had the opportunity to meet them after their show in SF - sort of snuck in to the afterparty - and they were so nice. And it didn't seem like they were tired and wanted to just get on the bus and go to the next city, but that they really wanted to stay and meet their fans. Thank you LIVE for everything. You never let me down."
3,Right up there with my favorite three,"Ever since I saw Live on the MTV special, I can't get enough. This CD ranks right up there with Collective Souls-Unititled, Dishwalla-Pet Your Friends and I Mother Earth-Scenery and Fish (a must to have!!!!). All these bands put alot of thought into their lyrics and music. Dolphins' Cry is past Lakinis Juice but just under I Alone for musical composition. I've heard the CD a few times, and like a normal Live CD, is starting to grow roots in me. If you don't like it on the second listen, go out and buy a CD from Love Inc or Sporty Theivz, then you'll be thankfull for their music!!!"
5,Wow.,"It's rare that I come across an album that makes me feel like someone ripped my heart out and held it in front of me like a mirror. This is one of those albums. I've only heard it once but I'm impressed, to say the least."
5,An awesome album!,"This is a comepletely awesome ablum from Live. I think it's their best accomplishment yet! Lead singer, Edward has done it once again with his amazing lyrics and has captured my imagination with them. This album is a deffinate work of art! You can't listen to this album just once, it is so captivating! I fully recommend this album."
4,great album,Great album but Live is also a band where most of their albums have a good amount of music. Not like the other albums where only 1 or 2 songs are hits and the rest suck. I guess it's just a reflection of talent - writers and band.
4,Surprisingly Moving,"After Throwing Copper and Secret Samadhi, I had convinced myself that Live couldn't do any better. I was wrong. I love this album - like both their previous albums, each song on this album has its own personality, and is genuinely moving - mood, lyrics, music is all amazing."
4,Excellent (actually 4 1/2 stars),"I've had this CD since Dec. 1999 and it remains one of my favorites in recent years.""The Dolphin's Cry"" is a stellar song,and easily the crown jewel.The other radio hits""Run To The Water""(mellow) and ""They Stood Up For Love""(catchy) are fine songs and worth checking this CD out for. This Live CD has a overall warm,spiritual, mid-paced, yet very powerful feel to it. I really can't say that there is a bad song on this disc, they all have a quality sound with lots of subtleties in both the music and singing.""Sparkle"",""Where Fishes Go"" and ""We Walk In The Dream"" are some of my favorites. Another fine Live Cd."
3,"Live Gets Sensitive.... A Good album, but not typical Live","When I purchased The Distance To Here, I expected that ""The Dolphin's Cry"" was just a lapse, and the rest of the songs would cede quickly to the hard-edged maelstrom that was ""Secret Samadhi"". I found the tracks on this one sensitive, yet with an edge. It is a credit to Live to say that when they do this well, they are superb, yet when they do it poorly, it really makes you wish they had gone the route of their previous albums. ""The Distance"" I also feel is one of their best tracks ever (""Lakini's Juice"" being my pick if you want the hard edged Live). All in all it boils down to how you want your Live. A good album, yes, but sonic diversity would have upped the rating a great deal. Nonetheless, worth your money."
2,Upbeat But Quite Not Deep Enough,"Live pretends that Secret Samadhi never existed and now they come back with a more commercially friendly album. However, there isn't much substance to these songs and the band seems more interested in spreading the message of peace and love rather than actually making good music."
2,Live are not what they used to be,"I believe that every band is capable of putting out at least one good album in their career. Some bands are talented enough to put out several, but the y're in the minority (i.e. Beatles, Rolling Stones). Live falls squarely in the former category. Take half of Mental Jewelry and half of Throwing Copper and you've got one great album.The Distance To Here is barely better than tripe in my opinion. I was so disappointed at Secret Samadhi -- the songwriting, the music, the pretentiousness of the ""message"" and plain old Ed Kowalczyk. I had high hopes for The Distance to Here as some sort of return to form. No such luck. The lyrics are just as bad and the music hasn't progressed either. Live used to write good songs. They used to be a good live band. I used to care about them. Now they're just noise on the modern rock scene."
2,Bad Combo...,"The worst combination you can have in music is self-importance and pretention and Live have both in spades. Listening to this album feels like ol' Ed and the Gang are trying to make some grand statement with each song. Ed feels really strongly about what he's saying while the band decides to back him up with some ! behind every statement. This kind of thing gets really old and tedious after a while. With song titles like ""Feel the Quiet River Rage"" and ""They Stood Up for Love"" you can't expect a downplay. Bands like Live and Dave Matthews are for people who like to sit in coffee shops and discuss, like, really important stuff over a double mocha half-caf with a twist while real people drinking black can't help but laugh at these goons quietly to themselves."
3,Actually 3 and half stars.....,"This was the first Live album I ever bought, after hearing Run to the Water on the radio. At first I loved it, but having since bought Throwing Copper I've come to the conlusion that it's only decent. The Dolphins Cry, Run to the Water, The Distance, Sun, Where Fishes Go and Face and Ghost are all good songs, with good lyrics. Other than that the album seems forced, and not at all like Live. Like I said, it's a decent album....but doesn't hit the heights of Throwing Copper"
2,Uugggghhhh...,"that's better. Live hit their nadir on this horribly pretentious, over-zealous album. Kowalczyk (or whatever his bloody name is) is a great vocalist but he needs to come down off his spiritual stool in the sky and get back to the consistency of Throwing Copper again. The Distance From Here is passable for the first four or five tracks. The Dolphin's Cry is heard-it-all-before, but at least carries some resonance, while The Distance and Sparkle begin to show some promise, but it all goes very quickly downhill after the anthemic Run To The Water, with not one redeeming feature. The lyrics are awful, the music is plodding and predictable, and one of the most likeable post-grunge bands sink into unavoidable oblivion. Awful."
4,The Distance to Here,"Live's last album, ""Throwing Copper"" was a huge hit, so huge many critics thought Live couldn't top it's previous success and would drop out of the music business. Once again, Live has proven them wrong. Their first single from this album, The Dolphin's Cry, is a wonderful song which showcases Live's ability to perform the fast and hard rock songs, along with slow songs, nearly ballads. This is a terrific CD, made by a terrific band which is sure to be around for a long time to come."
2,Not that great,"I brought this cd after a freind of mine told me that it was ""awesome"". Well, he was wrong, i got the cd and listened to it a there are only two good songs, one of them being the single Dolphin's Cry. I was dissapointed to spend my money on this, oh well."
1,very disappointed,i bought this phone for my daughter for her b-day. i pluged it in 24 hours before her b-day so i could call her on her new phone. the battery never charged up & i have been looking for a new battery for 2 weeks . she has still not been able to use her phone. the battery is an odd size & very hard to find. (...).
2,funkadelic really means funky,I too purchased this phone for my daughter but for Xmas. She loves it but I have the same problem. The battery pack it came with won't charge and I still haven't found a replacement. I am very disappointed in this phone.
1,Waste of $$$,"I agree the other parents that this phone is a waste of money. It interferes with the phone line and dies in the middle of calls. In the middle of the night it beeps for no reason, and then cuts off the phone line. It also does not have a long range from the base. I have not figured out how to use the features to store phone numbers, etc and we have hadthe p[hone for almost a year and a half. I ended up buying her a new ""corded"" phone for Christmas."
1,Buy a real phone,"(...)I thought that my daughter would really like this phone mainly because it was cordless. However, after charging the phone, we could not hear or speak in the headset. The only thing this phone does well is RING!. Please do not not spend your money on this phone. It is only useful if you want to use it to decorate a room!"
3,Runs slow...,"Well, to start off with, I think the watch looks nice. Not too small, not too big. But, I feel that the materials used to make it aren't really worth $90 and my biggest complaint is that it runs slow. Usually 20-30 minutes a day, which is a popular complaint for Tommy Hilfiger watches. Wont' be buying another one."
4,Computer to LCD TV cable,This cable works fine for hooking up your computer to the LCD TV set. The only problem with it for me was the audio cable was too short to connect to the computer. It has about a one foot audio cable off of the main cable on each end. Not long enough to reach the audio port on the side of the laptop after connecting the main plug to the back of the computer. I would recommend buying two separate cables.
2,Will keep looking,"This night cream goes on smoothly and feels rich (but not greasy) on my combination skin. I was looking for a nourishing, anti-aging moisturizer for my 40-ish face but I see no visible effects from using it for nearly 2 months--no wrinkle reduction or skin firming benefits. It's a decent night cream, but I will keep looking for one that is more aggressive in its anti-aging benefits. P.s. it does have kind of a strong fragrance, so ""scent""-sitive types may want to steer clear! :)"
2,Bad for oily skin,"Pros:Smells niceDoesn't clog poresOil freeCons:Way too hydratingI have oily skin and since it said oil free on the back, I figured I might be ok... I woke up with basically an oil slick on my face. I used it for about a week and it's just way too hydrating. It feels non greasy but it causes my face to produce so much oil!It smells great and would probably be great for someone with drier skin, but definitely not for me. Right now I'm just using it on my neck and hands so I would at least get something out of it lol"
2,Probably good -- not for me.,"I was disappointed when I found an article that said the form of retinol found in this product (retinyl palmitate, I believe) works well for acne, not for photo-damage/aging. But I also have breakouts, so I thought this would still be helpful. When applied the product felt lightweight and non-greasy, had a light, sweet, vanilla kind of scent, and my skin felt immediately smooth. However, I assumed that little ""tingle"" was an effect for the retinoids, but turned out to be an allergic response. I had hives on my lower face and neck by morning. I don't usually have this kind of response to skin care products. But it doesn't mean this won't work well for someone else."
2,not for sensitve skin!!!!!!,"This cream makes my skin feel softer, its true. BUT I have sensitive skin and I don't know if its the fragrance (which I liked) or what but it eventually made my skin break out in tiny, itchy bumps around my mouth area, above my lips and on my chin. Going to exchange it for the non anti wrinkle, regular age defying night cream and see how that goes."
1,unusually bad for an Olay product,Account holders wife here. This is a very strong smelling cream. I put it on and it made my face hot and red. It may clear wrinkles off ... I'm not chancing another adventure with it. If your skin is at all sensitive do not use this. My 40 year old plus skin is pretty tough and this got me.
4,precise and sophicated,Volume 3 is much more detailed to the previous two publications. It covers a wide range of projects from the desktop competition to the huge kansai airport. But it seems that the author have too much emphasis on the kansai and alleviate the depth of the others
5,great spiritual music,"excellent soft rock spiritual music. jeni has a very nice voice. tracks are 1-right here 2-adventure with you 3- you [knock, knock] 4-its all good 5-be holy 6-tracing your hand 7-takin' in the air 8-remind me 9-funny 10-captured"
5,not for the faint of heart,this is a great book. but it is not for beginers. i have been playing for 14 years and this book tore my hand up. its great.
4,Exactly as it says on the tin,"This is the MECHANICS of speed playing.This book is a great aid for developing speed and accuracy in your lead guitar technique, regardless of personal tastes. But it is not fun. It is difficult to maintain motivation over long periods of time, because the focus is on the fundamentals of technique, not on creativity.However, it is a solid collection of exercises, and makes a fine addition to a balanced practice regime that includes more expressive, enjoyable practices such as learning from the tablature of your favourite pieces. Use the exercises in this book as warm-ups at lower tempos, and looks for ways in which they relate to sections of the solos you are trying to learn. Then incorporate them into your practice that way.You know what they say, a a spoonful of sugar..."
3,Too overwhelming,"I am an intermediate player and this guitar book is meant for shredders only. If you like poison, whitesnake, or guns n' roses and want to emulate the intense guitar solos of the mid 80s, then this book is for you. I saw all the positive reviews for this book and purchased it but I must say that I just threw it out because it is just too overwhelming. I know all I would need to do is practice slowly day in and day out but the exercises are all just speed exercises. Granted, I'm sure you will perfect all aspects of your guitar playing, but if you are a beginner or an intermediate player, I think you will find this book just to be too much. That is my opinion."
3,Good book if...,"This is a great book to help build your lead chops IF you know how to practice. Troy does a really poor job of explaining some of the essential things you must know in order to improve. One of the biggest being muscle tension and how you must eliminate it from your hands while playing. He never mentions stuff like that once and that's just really, really stupid cause you can practice those exercises for thousands of hours tensed up and never really get better unless you correct it. Same with muscle memory no explanation. So if you're a beginner and wants to shred buy the book AND get a good teacher and you'll be on your way."
4,Great for mechanics,"I like the book and am still working with it after 3 months.The book comprises 3 parts: Mechanical Ability, Rhythmical Ability, and Creativity. Part I (46 pages) is great, part II (10 pages) is adequate, but part III is very weak (12 pages). Quality overall is good, but the page count will give you an idea of the strengths and weaknesses.The book highlighted problems I was having (left-right hand coordination problems) and gave me exercises to fix them. The ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" is one of my favourites, a great workout, especially for my lazy LH pinky! I've been playing acoustic for years, but just started electric a year ago with a teacher. This book is a lot more systematic than what I was getting from my teacher, and has been really helpful."
5,A WISE INVESTMENT!!!!!!,"Buying this book was by far the best investment I've made in a long time! The exercises start off a little slow but build to playing absolute monster runs and sequences. The CD is great to refer to as well as to show you how what you are practicing will sound like when you perfect it, and speed it up to 160 BPM.My guitar playing has improved dramatically since buying this book. If you want to sound like Malmstein, this is for you."
5,Are you a shredder?,"""If you're a shredder and like to spank the plank, this is your book dude!"" Speed and accuracy, all in one kit."
5,A collection of speed excercises from novice to virtuoso...,"I'd have to say that even after owning this book for a few weeks, it has already helped me greatly improve my abilities and repretoire as a guitarist. The excercises contained in this book have provided me with a vast number of tools by which to build my speed and accuracy. The sweep picking section was incredibly challenging, and I am sure that I will be using this book years down the line. I would recommend this book to ANY guitarist, young and old."
4,Good With A Catch,"I owe much of my success to this book.. I remember being 13 and just starting out. The words 'speed' and 'lead' caught my eye. I learned some great left hand tricks right off the bat but when it came time to play 'Flight of the Bumble Bee' I just couldn't hack it. Now, 20 years later, I bought the book again to show my students. (I own a music school of my own.) I realize now that it's nearly impossible to play the Bumble Bee song the way it is transcribed. I believe Troy wrote out the notation but then some other guy wrote out the TAB. It's insane and mostly in open position which shredders never do. So I re-transcribed it and now it makes a world of sense. I need to find the Delorian and warn young me about this. :) hehe..Great book!"
5,This book is sweet!,"If I had to describe this book in one word, I would say it is INSANE! I just started playing guitar a couple months ago and this book has improved my skills drastically! This isin't for a person who expects to master Stetina's techniques in a few weeks,but I have already noticed a change in my playing ability and I have only had the book for 3 days! You might also want to try Stetina's Metal Guitar, Volume 1, because some of teh techniques used get really hard really fast. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to make their skills faster and better!"
3,"Short, but well thought out.","A simple but well thought out book. Lots of exercises, some good insights and solid basic advice. I will probably use this for some time -- if only for dexterity training. Let down by poor print quality (esp. some of the diagrams), and out of date layout (no CD track numbers and references to the cassette which, presumably, accomanpied this book sometime... long ago). Decent value at Amazon.com prices. This will not be my main book."
4,this book is not easy,"My method for learning guitar techniques so far is to find really really hard exercises to play and get good at them, and boy did I hit the jackpot with this book.It's pretty much impossible to not improve your technique if you practice these exercises regularly.Even if you don't care for the shred metal style this book is geared for (I sure don't) your technique will improve for all styles."
3,DISAPOINTMENT!,"I am a hughe Psycho Realm Fan, ever since they first appeared on the ""mi Vida Loca"" Soundtrack, I was Fascinated with they'r Gritty Vocals, and Revolutionary Lyrics. After B-Real Left the group, the group lost its only commericial sense, wich was a good thing, and led to the Creations of Book 1, and Book 2, wich are some of the Best Albums hip-hop has to Offer. And that leads us to this album, wich is a sort of Compilation like album, featuring everything Sick Symphonies has to offer. This is very different from the 3 Psycho Realm Albums, and i know this is not a Psycho Album, but i was diapointed in the new Beat style, it is sounding very commercial, wich is something i despise. I feel that all the Grit, and the Edge of the realm is Fading, and they are destined to have the same Faith of the Wu-Tang Clan. I Hope that if and when an Official Psycho Realm album drops, it wont be like the sick Symphonies Compilation, im out!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Instructions and Help are non-existent and the only way to play on-line is to host your own game by giving out your IP address.The course-builder includes Medieval, Pirate, and Western themes, and there are fun obstacles and interesting course shapes and configurations. Unfortunately, while trying to figure out how to operate the game, I managed to delete the Medieval ones. The CD isn't safe-guarded."
4,great for what it is,"It's a fun game to design courses on, but play does get a bit repetitive. The feature to play the hole in demo mode is great so you don't create any unplayable areas. Well worth the price!"
5,Little Einsteins fire truck,"Great service, my son loves this DVD and we have watched it several times now!"
3,Basic Release,This disc contains 4 episodes of Little Einsteins. One episode is new and the other three are from the Playhouse Disney broadcasts. The episodes included on this disc are:Fire Truck RocketMelody the Music PetCarmine's Big RaceMr. Penguin's Ice Cream AdventureAll episodes are ~22 minutes in length and are present in 4:3 Full Frame Format.
5,Yummy with just enough chocolate flavor,"These not too sweet sticks are totally addictive. I open a box and find, without noticing, that I've eaten most of it. They have a pleasant, but definite chocolate flavor. The cheese in them lends an intriguing creaminess.Great stuff."
3,Pyramids and Pawns,"The author is correct about the FED and the IRS being the worst of the pyramidal organizations set up by the ""invisible dictator"" to control the pawns (you and me) of society. I only give the author three stars because the author does not mention the subject of authority... that the Constitution is truly a contract between the states and the federal govt. That unless one consents to this contract via another contract (voter registration) the governments have no true authority over you. The author believes this greedy and corrupt govt can be voted out of office. This is NOT going to happen. Please think about this. If everyone would simply repudiate their voter registration the govt of ""no authority"" would, legally and lawfully be powerless. See Larken Roses's video ""I'm allowed to Rob You""[...]"
4,Pretty Good (except for Ben Folds),"A pretty good Christmas CD. As with all compilation Christmas CDs, there are a couple ""oh aren't we so clever"" goofy clunkers that threaten to ruin the whole CD. Jimmy Eat World is bad but Ben Folds ""Bizarre Christmas Incident"" just doesn't belong on a nice, mostly quiet, very-good-bedtime-cd-for-a-five-year-old-yet-good-enough-for-the-parents-to-enjoy-too Christmas CD. When yours is the dumbest song on a CD that also includes Barenaked Ladies, that's bad."
5,MY REVIEW,"Overall, I like the CD. I usually skip over Vanessa Carton's ""Greensleeves,"" though, because I think it sounds awful. And the only other problem I have with it is ""Rudolph""- I mean, it's good, all except for when he says ""Reindeers."" THERE IS NO ""S"" ON THE PLURAL OF REINDEER!!! *sigh* Will society EVER get a firm grasp on grammar? I doubt it."
5,one of the best alt/indie holiday album to date,"if you are tired of all the cheesy holiday stuffs you hear on the radio, at the mall, etc., and looking for more 'left of the field' holiday tunes, 'MtC' is a must buy. this cd is one of my all time favorite christmas cd's, prolly along with likes of 'MtC2', 'O Come All Ye Faithful' (pro-choice benefit compilation featuring Flying Saucer Attack, Henry Rollins, Cranes, Dance Hall Crashers et al, now out of print maybe?) and 'Just Say Noel' (Beck, the Roots, Sonic Youth, SCotS, Remy Zero which is also bit rare to find nowadays)"
5,Something new for this Christmas,Heard the Jack Johnson Rudolph on the radio the other day and it was awesome! Can't wait to hear the entire CD!
4,Pleasant Christmas Everyone!,"The best ""modern"" Christmas CD I've come across. The melodies are mostly low-key, so keep looking if you're searching for energy music. Which isn't to say the songs aren't entertaining, the lyrics are usually standard, but there are pockets of cleverness blended in. The songs are mostly pop, being sung by popular artists, but the style varies a bit from Coldplay's crooning, to Loreena McKennitt's more traditional/hymnal track at the end. My favorite song is the cooperative rendition of GOD REST YE MERRY GENTLEMEN by Barenaked Ladies and Sarah McLachlan. Worth the price, good gift idea too. Merry Christmas!"
1,Peculiar Amazon indexing,"A search for Deep Purple's ""Smoke on [in] the water,"" brought up this title. I rate it only #1 because I could not locate the ""Smoke on the Water"" listing. Amazon seems to be having an indexing problem."
5,"Lovely, inspiring for artists!","I bought this book for myself, and now I'm buying more copies to give to others, for Christmas. It's THAT good!Don't be confused because it seems to be a ""children's"" book. It's far more than a cute story... the words and concepts are the sort of thing that inspire great art.If I could create a billboard for this book, it'd be a take-off on that ""This is your brain on drugs"" series: I'd have a plain sheet of paper on one side, saying, ""This is your creativity,"" and then on the right side, I'd have a picture of the Sistine Chapel, with the caption, ""This is your creativity after reading '...Merchant of Marvels...' "" ! *grin*Yes, I love this book!"
5,Great Fun Game,This game is alot of fun. It may take a game or 2 to get the basics down but it is totally worth any effort you put into it. I really enjoy it.
5,Fun game,I love the killer bunnies game it's fun for whole family. Plus you get to be evil during the game and kill off your other players cards and bunnies during course of game. But if you love a good humor game buy this whole set from start to finish. Then look for new one comming out later this year.
2,Unfortunately all too similar to set two,"From my review of ""set two"". This set of movies/TV shows was a perfect example of ""bad"" melodrama from the 1970s. The acting is, at best adequate, the plots ""so-so"", the musical accompaniment overdone, and the episodes were at best boring and overly drawn out.All in all an unfortunate purchase"
5,Great British Mysteries!,"I heard alot about the stories featured in this Mystery Set Vol. 1 , They were so good I just had to come back and purchase Vol. 2 as well , all of the mysteries in both Vol. 1 & 2 are just great , If you like good mystery's your going to love this set! W. Croce"
4,Unintended insight,"I believe the 1979 movie, The Lathe of Heaven lacks the effects and transition to do the story line justice. It would be easy for some people to lose what is happening in the story as the reality changes in the time frame. The author, Ursula K. Le Guin brings out many questions about the society we live in and the attitudes we have about each other. Although she denies her writing has any intended under tones about the celestial beings and life after death one can not wonder how so many people made that connection when reading the book and/or seeing the movie. All-in-all, I have always liked the story and was thrilled when this movie came out. It is one of my favorite stories."
4,a movie from my memory,"I remembered this movie from when it was on TV and have looked for it since. The quality of the movie is weak, poor lighting not much spent on props or special effects. It looks more like a play on stage being recorded. The story line however and much of the acting carries the poor cinematography. I am glad to add it to my sci fi collection."
2,Worth Checking Out...From The Library,"Ursula K. Le Guin is one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time, and her book ""Lathe of Heaven"" ranks as one of her greatest achievements. Unfortunately, the TV movie ""Lathe of Heaven"" not only features cheesy effects and music (even for the time this film was made, which really wasn't so long ago), but also terrible direction and acting. It is, however, worth checking out from your local library, especially for the fascinating interview with Le Guin included on the DVD."
2,Very overrated,"I have to go against the grain here and give this movie the thumbs down. The special effects were cheesy even for the time, especially the ones that looked like they came from an even lower-budget version of the 60s sci-fi TV series, ""The Time Tunnel."" The science-fictional plot of someone with effective dreams is truly absurd. Even as a fantasy theme it just doesn't get off the ground. The movie isn't helped by some weak dialog writing although the backdrop of an overpopulated world suffering from unpredictable and severe weather changes makes for a somewhat interesting and appropriately bleak and dark future.I give the film 3 stars, although it really deserves 2, just because I hate giving anything connected with Le Guin such a low rating.On a personal note, I knew Le Guin's brother, Ted Kroeber, who was my statistics prof in college, and Ted was really a pretty cool prof. (I had to throw that in--since I'm dissing his famous sister's book/movie). :-)"
2,Read the book instead,"I had high hopes that this movie would supplement and enhance my experience and memories of reading the story in Leguin's book. I'm sorry to say this, but it detracted instead. Cardboard acting, little rendition of interior state, important elements glossed. I *love* PBS, but I can't understand the reverence people feel for this, well, dog of a movie. If you can read, read the book."
3,Dismal DVD,"I agree with the many reviewers that this is a fantastic, wonderful film. Unfortunately, the quality of this DVD is so horrible that it is difficult to watch (That's why I gave so few stars).But there is hope. Tonight I saw a broadcast of the film on PBS, and it looked pretty good. It was a pledge drive, and the station was offering a new remastered version for membership contributions. I look forward to seeing that version hit the market, then I can give it five stars, as the content of this film richly deserves."
4,Lathe of Heaven review,"The movie was extremely good. Especially when I compare it to the movies recently spilled out of hollywood. It even followed the storyline in the book, which is quite rare nowadays. But, alas, there is always the sorry part: the quality of the film is rather poor. Well, I was warned when I ordered it. The DVD has been made out of 2 surviving copies on 20mm tape (or something to the same effect).If you are more interested in the content of a film (story) than the special effects, this DVD is a very good choice.About the delivery: Thanks to you all in Amazon. I received my movie sooner than I expected."
5,Classic SF!,"A fine and faithful telling of Ursula K. LeGuin's beautiful story of a man whose dreams have more power than he wants, and what happens when he meets a man who wants more power than he has. This low-key production was perfect for its believability and quiet, dreamlike mood. Probably far superior to the current remake being done by A&E, which looks (from the ""Making Of..."" feature I caught the other night) like it's going to be full of unnecessary razzle-dazzle and obnoxious story changes. Do yourself a favor, buy this video for the real story of George Orr and his dreams. Leave A&E to follow Dr. Haber in his lust to remake the world in his own image, soullessly. Stick with PBS, and watch this fine video instead."
5,Charming and sweet,"How difficult it is to pinpoint what separates a classic from a B-movie. Although the concept of this movie is not especially innovative, it has a charm and sweetness and a Zen-like quality that make it truly exceptional. I've been waiting for many years to see it again, and I was not disappointed by this DVD. Even the low-tech special effects seem to add to the dream-like atmosphere of the production. Without hitting us over the head, the movie gently raises questions about the futility of changing the world, suggesting that our relationships with each other are what really deserve our attention."
4,80's Retro Space Age Trip,"The Lathe of Heaven is a wonderful Sci Fi drama where a man dreams reality and the ""truth"" is he does. Anything he dreams seems to become reality. In this retro style pop modern setting, the lead character and his therapist try to create a different world. This story directs its attention towards problems and concerns of the times, such as race population explosions and war. It is a cult classic that never really had its day. It was to premier at the same time as Star Wars and Indiana Jones and the like, but was for some reason, held back from release. Yes, it is VERY ""dated"" in its appearance, but its messages still have something to learn from."
4,Much better than the new remake,Skip the new one with Lisa Bonet and get right to the original. This one is much closer to the book and even begins to explain a little more about what is *really* going on if you pay attention.
4,A Classic in 1970's Sci-Fi,"The Lathe of Heaven, a wonderful novel by Ursula K. LeGuin, translates marvelously well to film. It aired only once on PBS and was finally reaired and put up for sale on video and DVD. The basic plot - an everyman, George Orr, has the power to make his dreams come true, and the results have endless possibilities. The intense pyschological drama of this movie, coupled with its futuristic look, and the twist ending, make it an absolute classic in science fiction. The interview with the author at the end of the film brings many different interpretations and analystic choices, and answers a few questions viewers might have about the film. If you saw the original airing of the movie, you'll be thrilled with the re-release. It's been 20 years in the waiting."
3,Enjoy Dallas' Modern City Hall and surrounding sights/sites.,"I lived in Dallas for most of 1979 so this show and all of the ""Dallas"" TV shows made me a little homesick for that area. The ""Lathe of Heaven"" was filmed using the modern buildings in and around Dalla/Fort Worth and for that reason I'm glad it is available on DVD. I am a ""sort of"" science-fiction fan and enjoyed this far out story of a young man who changes the world with dreams. I'm a resident of Oregon now so it is fun to see how Portland, Oregon has a lack of rain and hot days in this story. This is a very entertaining movie if you just roll with the story and enjoy it as science-fiction with no underlying hidden meanings."
2,Run of the mill,"Not terrible, just kind of pointless. The ending has a surprise, but I found it to be a cheap and contrived one. Mrs. Arnold doesn't have a solid grip on style and plot, and her main character for some reason isn't all that likeable.If you're looking for a dazzling read, try British author Robert Goddard, who is constantly hailed by all reviewers from the W. Post to the NY Times, but has never really achieved fame in the US. His plots are brilliant!"
5,classic Brit espionage,"Having personally lived aspects of the Cold War and read the contemporaneous literature of the time and the revisionist literature coming out now, it is heartening to see personal ethical conflict in these then contemporary now retro-episodesThe low key trudging flavor of real intelligence work is evident with the occassional terror of needed action.The inability to trust even the agency for which one works creates a burden that ultimately withers most individuals. Career agents experience a life of conflict and tumoil or a life of oblivious obedience."
4,Works Fine,It does what it is supposed to do. It makes my laptop work without the power supply. Now my laptop is out of date. I have a new one now.
5,We're not your next door family!,"Ok, so some people at work have goofed on me for watching this but I don't care. I know that some of it is pretty contrived but, who cares. I love getting to see into the life of one of my rock heroes. The family is very fun and entertaining to watch. Nick is brilliantly funny! Shannon and Sophie are sweet and funny too. My favorite parts are when they are in Gene's office and you can see all the cool Kiss merch.Oh yeah...love him or hate him, Gene is a master businessman and a great father."
2,"Content OK, transfer bad!","This season is a marked step down in terms of the quality of material presented. Nevertheless, it is still passable entertainment.The disappointing aspect of this release is the quality of the transfer. Namely, whilst the show is presented in 'widescreen', it is a non-anamorphic transfer and therefore looks terrible on all widescreen display devices. I.e. for some reason, whilst the show is in 16:9, it has been transferred in a 4:3 frame."
4,Running Shirt,I bought this shirt as a gift for my son who runs all year. He said the shirt is comfortable and lightwieght and perfect for the summertime.
5,Great Product,This product was a favorite in my household we used it for may different recipes and always enjoyed the great taste.Great Product!Highly Recommended!
4,The Mustangs Great Garage,"As a Ugly Things reader and re-reader I was most interested to get to hear these guys as I feel like I know them from the their story in Ugly Things ( get it it is the fanzine that sets the standard )Listened to the Cd this morning and I like the 45 they are famous for ""and thats for sure "" fuzz and vocals ala The Rolling Stones. I liked it but what I really liked was the rest and that would be their covers of the current tunes that during the time were popular ....check out Gloria , Get off my cloud and I'm Down and several others all fabulous for the time and the place.Get the cd and get your Ugly Things magazine with the article on the band !Great Stuff and I am glad to have the chance to hear something done so long ago..yet so right for now!James T"
5,My son loves this!,"This toy set is exactly as pictured, and I'm very pleased with my purchase. My son recently learned to scuba dive and loves the toys."
4,Expensive but works the best,I think this motorcraft part can't be beat for low noise. I recently tried another aftermarket fan but is was noisy and didn't install quite as easy as the motorcraft. I'll advise how it holds up later on.
4,Please help on this,"Hi everyone, I saw the movie recently and I really liked, but I dont have the soundtrack, that's why I'd like to know the name of a song I heard, and it was played when the gang (Macy's included) was arriving to defend the guys, besides of that, they killed themselves. Hope to read from anyone who knows. Thank You"
4,Romance ans Doom,"Collection of movies that take on the darker, sometimes grittier side of romance, yet remain poignantly human. A good collection."
5,Great Gift for Patient,"Very very practical ... tells you tips and tricks you would never think of. It is a book you don't think you need until you read it!!Give it to anyone you know who is facing knee, hip, foot surgery ... they will be forever grateful!"
2,Buyer beware,"Looks like a public domain release from Intersound Portugal (and not the Netherlands as indicated by Amazon as at the time of this review). No annotation, no recording information, only 14 tracks per disc for a total of around 112 minutes - could have easily fitted onto two cds rather than three. Overall I find the transfer quality to be unsatisfactory, although this is hard to assess as this seems to vary from track to track, and there are also several tracks which are obviously derived from radio broadacats. Many tracks, to my ear at least, seem to have a hollow abrasive sound to them, and where these tracks are duplicated on other cheaper public domain cds in my collection, they sound better than they do here. Other tracks do however sound okay. At the price currently being charged by Amazon, only worth getting if you are desperate for tracks you can't get elsewhere."
5,Big and Beautiful!,"Small wrists beware: this is a pretty big (heavy) watch. Very cool. Most of the time, the watch is dark (no lights), but once you press the button you get a few seconds of flashing lights (which can be skipped by pressing it again), then it gives you the time. It did take me a few tries to get the hang of telling time on it, but I think I am a slow learner. All in all, a pretty cool watch. Definitely unique. Just not for those looking for dainty. One of my favorite time pieces."
2,Shuts off frequently,"I wanted a good heater near my work bench in my garage. The Stanley Worked great for awhile and now it turns off every 10 minutes. The red LED light always stays on even if it is off, but plugged in. The label on the back of the unit says if it shuts off, un-plug, leave it on high and wait 10-minutes before plugging in. 20-minutes is what it takes and then it runs again for 10-minutes and shuts off again.Labels on the selector switches are not easy to understand."
2,For small rooms only,"This is a good heater, light-weight and nice-looking, but it does NOT throw out a great deal of heat or have a strong blower. For a small room, it's probably great. It's pretty quiet, too."
4,Ceramic Heater,"Pros: Space heater works good and design to make it near impossible to turn over get against something it should not. Low air movement (even on high) will warm the area without hard fan blowing. Adjustable positions from level to near 45.Cons: Fan only works up to maximum temperature. You have to set the temperature regardless of heat or fan only. (We purchased this heater to help dry the dog after her bath.) Does not tilt forward enough for what we wanted and I don't think it tilts far enough up either.If you want a low CCM fan/heater, great purchase. Very sturdy built and should last a long time,"
1,Unreliable Under Normal Use,"NOTE: This heater is NOT made by Stanley. It is made by Lasko and is actually a Lasko 5900 model.Good:When it works, this heater has great heating capability. I really enjoyed using this product, when it worked.Bad:It is completely unreliable under normal use. I had to return the first one because it died after 6 months. After sitting on hold with Lasko for 45 minutes, they finally answered the phone and gave me an RMA to return it.The REPLACEMENT heater I received died after two weeks of use.The bottom line, when it works, it is a great heater. However, there is a serious reliability issue with this product.Beware of non-hand tool items with the Stanley label.I have to give this 1 star due to the reliability issue."
1,Shuts off at night,"Today I'm returning the second unit in two weeks. Same problem - thermostat shuts off in the middle of the night. I've tried using it in my greenhouse, but have lost a lot of plants as a result of its unreliability. With the Stanley name on it I was excited, but now I'll try another brand, except for a Lasko heater who makes it for Stanley."
4,Looks can be deceiving,"Judging by the way it look you think it blow a decent amount of hot air, well it does'nt. after careful consideration i decided to change my point of view on this, it doesnt blow a lot of air but it seem to heat up very nicely in fact now i realize it can heat up a cold room so much you need to open a window."
1,do not buy,they biggest waste of money i spenst of money i will not stanley tools again. i am a contactor and will tell all my friends..
3,get up close and personal !!,i like the heater ! it will proberly work better in a small area ?? but it doesn't heat up a garage very fast !! especially in northern new england ; and my garage is insulated ?? not like the picture on the box with an uninsulated jobsite !!
5,Stanley Heater Portable 675900 Pro Ceramic,"I found this product to be outstanding in performance! It has saved me a lot of money on propane, as my forced air heat is propane, and with the use of this little magic heater, my furnace hardly ran at all on nights down in the high 20's and low 30's! Thank you Stanley!Stanley 675900 Pro Ceramic"
2,turns off before heating room,"I brought it to warm up the bathroom for my wife. She can easily pick it up and move it. However it only runs for about 5 minutes then shuts off. I have used an air compressor to blow it out a few times and it may run a little longer the next time but then shuts off again before warming the room. my wife even removes it from the bathroom before using any powder! I am very disappointed with this unit. I thought the industrial design meant it was rugged and could even be used in a workshop. My 20 year old heater worked much better! I would not recommend this for any use. It can't even hold up to clean, indoor use, I'm sure it wouldn't last long in someones shop."
3,Good story,The story line was OK. I found that there were several chapters that were repeatedly downloaded. That takes up space on the Kindle.
2,not mine,Sorry to say that this book left me confused. I could not follow the plot in respect to the author I felt that the use of the ornate discriptives in it was I felt was overdone. So the plot became lost. I think that for the most part the plot was good but was able to hold my interest. I cannot in good conscious recommend this book.
4,"Promising beginning, fascinating falconry","I'm a big fan of PI novels, and since I'm always looking for something a little different, I picked this book up primarily because the detective was a falconer. Not that I have a particular interest in falconry; it just made the book stand out from the other paperbacks on the rack. And indeed, Frank Pavlicek's hobby was a great component of the story, and I learned a lot. The main story - Frank stumbles upon a corpse, and it turns out his daughter knew the murdered young man - is nicely plotted and suspenseful. My only gripe is that I wish the writing had been a little snappier. Straka has a way to go until he reaches the level of a Pronzini or Grafton. But will I be keeping an eye out for future Pavlicek adventures? You bet."
4,A PI with a penchant for birds of the feathery persuasion,"There are loads of PI/crime books floating in the deep mire of e-literature, so it is incredibly hard to write one that captivates a reader enough to actually read on till the end. Although I found some of the dialogue stilted and there were some bits that were superfluous, overall this was a very good read. The author managed to keep the villain a secret till the last chapter or so and create characters that I for one would like to read about again. I think one of the most interesting aspects was the hobby the writer chose to give two of the main characters. It wasn't just your usual of let's swing a tennis racket, bounce a ball, chuck a golfball or swig a beer in front of a flatscreen. He has managed to bring the falconry into the story and make it part of the plot. A vey enjoyable read. I received a free copy of this book for my review."
4,A Witness Above,"Good story, enjoyed it all the way thru. It took a long time to even have an inkling of who's behind it all. Lots of twists and turns, but pulled together in the end. I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it"
3,Disappointing ending,"Good story that had me going up until the finish. While there was a surprise at the end, the story was too neatly tied-up."
4,Informative and Entertaining!,"Andy Straka has created a likeable and all to human PI named Frank Pavlicek. Frank's new case involves his daughter who he has not had a lot of contact with since she was a small child. The story becomes involved as elements of a past case surface that cost Frank his job in New York years ago.This book was interesting and entertaining but if you have read a lot of mysteries the bad guy was easy to suspect early on. This in no way took away from a good story that was a quick and fun read.Frank was also a falconer and this was part of the story line. The author did a good job of sharing details of these majestic birds and what is involved with owning and hunting them. This added a nice touch to the story as I always like to learn something new while being entertained.Thank you Mr. Straka for the complimentary copy with no obligation for a review. Now, I think I will go back and see how Frank's story began in the earlier books."
3,PG-13 Murder Mystery,"Want to read a good murder mystery that you don't have to be embarrassed about if one of your children should start reading it? Mr. Straka does a fine job grabbing your attention and keeping the plot moving. In this short novel you find yourself relating to Frank Pavlicek's love for his daughter when some would have left her to face the serious trouble she was in alone. Was she a victim or was she part of the crime? Also, Mr. Straka isn't hesitant in describing the strong faith of a black mother living in the midst of gangs and drugs."
4,No one gives them the love they need.,"This was the second studio album of the Everly Brothers 1980s ""comeback"". It's a very good album, which should appeal to their fans."
2,Not good at all,"Even though this movie sounded interesting, it didn't turn out to be worth it. The acting was terrible and the ""monster"" was worse. Overall, it looked like a group of friends were sitting around one day and decided to make a monster movie by covering one of them with some moss and vines and calling it a creature.Do yourself a big favor and pass on this."
4,A nice little variations book,"This is a book for the player who wants analysis of numerous variations in brief, unemphatic prose. There is little of the ""ideas behind the opening"" material that is essential to the lesser player (the reader might want to find Soltis' brief chapbook on the opening from some years ago for this type of thing), nor is there intricate theoretical discussion that a master level treatment might involve. Instead, this book seems geared for the A or B player, giving lines as developed in tournament praxis. I do not believe this is the best book with which to take up Larsen's, but if one enjoys playing Larsen's, this is a nice supplement to one's preparation."
3,Revenge is sweet ?,"5 teens were abducted by aliens 15 years ago, one of them ended up dead. Now 3 of them captured an alien and bring it to Wyatt (Adam Kaufman)'s home for revenge.Things start to go haywire, when the alien managed to get loose...Contain violence and gore content."
2,Only watch for the special effects..the rest sucks.,"The only redemption of this movie is some of the special effects are horrifyingly disgustingly good. The movie has a very high ""ewww..yuck.."" factor. So high in fact, that if you have a weak stomach you may vomit on yourself. The alien is expecially nasty good and just seeing it is probably worth the look-see. Besides that, the plot, characters and dialogue are ridiculous, stupid and inane. I own this movie and only keep it for the special effects, as a movie this bad usually gets sold."
2,Disappointment on Arrival,"Not being offered a view of this book before it arrived, I was very disappointed that the cover of it screamed out ""Dyslexic Spell-Well Dictionary"" and ""For Learning Disabilities"". I couldn't believe the cover actually stated those phrases! I bought these books for a resource room where there are students with and without disabilities, and one was also placed in the mainstream English room. Many kids have spelling problems, not just students with disabilities, and I feel the labels on the cover limit its use. I think the actual book is a nice tool, but the cover inhibits students of any type from using it. I took permanent marker and covered the offensive phrases before distributing them. I do like the binding, it makes the book easy to use, and my students have used it several times just in the first day. I was also disappointed that the actual definitions of the word were not given, so the students could check to see that they did have the correct word."
4,Summer Doctor,"Charles H. Knickerbocker writes about his professional and personal experience on a coast off Maine in form of a novel. His fictional Daniel van Dine M.D. is a nonconformist with a keen sense of history and rather strong religious inclinations. This medical doctor feels that a deeply personal doctor-patient relationship is far more important than medical progress. The reader will meet a much married millionaire, a fisherman, an anthropologist, a violent artist,, a displaced cleric, a woman fashion editor, an ex-chorus girl, a spinster librarian, a gin loving Indian midwife, and an unusual adolescent. This novel comes to conclusions which will be of interest to doctors and patients. In addition, the doctor also owns a dog named Slob. All this makes for interesting reading."
3,Takes a little more time than their previous albums...,"I wasn't drawn into this CD immediately, as I was with their previous releases, but it's growing on me. The second half is definitely stronger than the first, and overall I found the slower songs to be stronger than the full-on rockers (this is a major shift from ""K"" and ""Peasants, Pigs & Astronauts""). Fool That I Am, Shadowlands, Persephone, and Ol' Jack Tar are currently standing out for me as the real gems this time around... but if you're a fan, it's still worth the money. Even the weakest tracks are better than most of what's on the radio any given week of the year!"
5,Excellent combination of performance and value.,"I purchased the 20GB 7200 RPM Maxtor drive to replace my existing Western Digital 6.4 GB 5400 RPM hard drive. The installation went incredibly smoothly. If you are replacing a master drive, I highly recommend thrid party software, unless you just want to do a ""clean"" install on the new drive.The drive itself performs quite well. It's fast, quiet (which was a pleasant surprise after becoming used to my ""noisy"" WD Caviar), and a wonderdful value."
5,This is one of the seminal films of the post-World War 2 era.,"This is one of the seminal films of the post-World War 2 era.If you want to break your Heart, this film delivers !"
3,Where are the Hit Songs?,"I enjoy Rosemary Clooney's singing and I have a CD of her hit songs which I identify with her. Songs NOT on this DVD are Come On-A My House, Hey There, In The Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening, Mambo Italiano, Count Your Blessings, Botch-A-Me, Young At Heart, Be My Life's Companion, It Might As Well Be Spring, and This Ole House. These are the songs I associate with Rosemary Clooney, and none of them are included in the DVD. The DVD is in glorious black and white, and her singing is fine, but her hit songs are conspicious by their absence."
1,Not Worth Your Time and money,"I gave this work 1 star because I can't give it minus stars. This work is very aggravating to fans. Although it does have 18 of her lesser known performances the quality is poor and each number is ruined by titles & credits splashed across the beginning and end of each number. As if that was not bad enough, during the numbers, Passport Video has placed water marks appearing off and on in rotating corners of the performance. Very distracting and a deal breaker for me. Unlike the Rosemary Clooney Show DVD put out by the family, this Passport work is not worth your money, even if you get it for free. If you are a Rosie fan, skip this brief but annoying debased work. I will not purchase another Passport work again if they ruin the original work by splashing their name as credit for something they may own but had no part in creating. Thumbs Down"
4,Kaspar???,"I was looking forward to more of Tal. Now we have a whole book dedicated to his enemy Kaspar? I didn't care for that. Shouldn't a trilogy sort of follow the same people. If the author wishes to add a book with another perspective, maybe add an additional one and call it Book 2b or something.It was okay as far as the book itself goes, I just couldn't get over the Kaspar point of view. It did further the story and the ending wasn't what one would expect either. It sort of leaves you hanging in several spots that I understand will be dealt with in a subsequent series.Feist is always enjoyable, even this book."
2,Basically it's an interlude to Feists next series,It started off really strong. Then it started to go down hill from there. I thought the main character who was supposed to be the villian seemed like a lot of other characters that he's written which was a disppointment. Really didn't like how Feist turned around the plot for the introduction of the his next series. Honestly he's done this before. Ugh will not be reading the next series.
4,A good mystery-adventure that sets up the next trilogy.,"The third book in the Conclave of Shadows trilogy begins immediately after the ending of King of Foxes, but instead of following Talon as we did in the first two novels, we switch to (former) Duke Kaspar. Kaspar was under the sway of evil magician Leso Varen for the past few years, it turns out, so instead of killing him outright, the Conclave banished him to Novindus, a war-ravaged continent half a world away from his former homeland. His goal at first is to get back and seek revenge against those who wronged him (at least, that is the version of events he tells himself), but he quickly gets drawn into events that tie into the greater fight of good vs. evil.This is another fast-paced adventure and it contains information that kicks the larger story back into high gear."
4,Brooklyn - Not for Tourists Guide,"This is one the best map books - for those who really don't want to deal with the hassle of opening and refolding a map and looking like a tourist. Besides small manageable maps of Brooklyn neighborhoods, they include the different services (bar, restaurant, food market,etc.) that are in the neighborhood. The restaurant list is by no means complete - just a short list - maybe they need to get together with Zagat's? but that's really the only downside. Also the subway line map is imposed over the street map. This really is a big help when trying to figure out how to get there."
4,The books been there more than I have,"I love, love, love the NFT series. Everything is broken down by neighborhoods with a map to go with it. Not only do they have all the interesting stuff to do, see and eat in the neighborhood, they also give you landmark orientation as well. It has helped me find so many things I would have otherwise walked right past. My New York City version as well as the Brooklyn version have been up there more than I have due to all my friends wanting to borrow them for their trips up there."
4,Not sure,This thing is GREAT I just can't figure out who to work the fortune teller or the games. You can get a password to unlock your phone numbers. The odometer and the stopwatch are really cool. You can also see the times in different places! The only thing this is missing is a schedule.
3,excellent toy,this toy is really good it has excellent functions and i would recommend that you buy one i gave it 5 stars for fun because it is sooooo much fun
2,Couldn't figure it out.,"The instructions are pretty vague, the website(s) didn't offer much help.. And really, it's just too much hassle to figure out how to play it. If you can figure it out & manage to have fun with it, great! But I just couldn't figure out the instructions. They left a lot of holes and gaps, hence the frustration."
2,Overwhelming Rules,"We bought this for my 15 year old son's birthday. I mean, what says happy birthday to a 15 year old more than a game called ""Killer Bunnies"". We're a family who loves Settlers of Catan, Scategories, Risk as well as regular Hearts. I was excited to try this out. However, the rules were very complicated and vague. We played one game, and have not touched it for a month. I'm sure we'll give it another go, but we were so disappointed. If you buy this game, be prepared to thoroughly understand the rules and you'll probably need to play a few games before you will really understand it."
4,Killer fun - learn to play from someone else,"This is a really fun game, but I don't see how you could learn it from the instructions, as they are too vague. If you get someone to teach it to you, and just start playing you'll pick it up quickly.(...)I suspect the low review stems from someone trying to learn from the boxed instructions, which are well below par.Good luck with this game - I'm looking forward to buying the first expansion soon, even at the higher prices we pay for games here in Australia."
4,Great for competitive people who need to lighten up,"Killer Bunnies is perfect for most ages. Winning is luck just masquerading as skill. While there can only be one winner, nobody falls out until it's over. The game is about enjoying the trip, with lots of hilarious side roads. The only draw back is that you need to learn not to take it personally when your bunny gets bumped off by one of various methods of inhumane treatment."
5,Killer Bunnies,We have enjoyed this game with our family. My 25 and 23 year old sons consider it a mild version of Magic The Gathering.
4,"Fun, but complicated game.","My husband and I like this game, and although it is complicated it is easy to learn. You have to have good eye-sight and the ability to read to play this game."
4,Great Party Game!,"I purchased this game purely for parties, and made a good choice! It is a very fun and goofy game for a group of people who aren't taking things too seriously. We are in our mid-20's and find this game hilarious. You try to protect your bunnies while killing your opponents bunnies and collecting carrots! If you can't handle losing, this isn't a game for you, as a lot of it is left up to chance. I have been playing in a group of four, and I can see how even more people would add to the fun. I wouldn't recommend the game if you plan on just playing with just 2 or 3 people regularly.... but if you have friends who can join in, it's great!The only downfall of the game is some of the cards are difficult to interpret, and you will end up with a few 'House Rules"" to get through the game...I doesn't effect the game play much, but if you are a 'by the book' kind of person, it may annoy you."
5,Good clean fun,"My son who is in college put this on his wish list for Christmas. He plays it often with his friends at his apartment complex. He bought the Red Bunny booster pack and then invited me to play with his friends. I'd say that's a pretty good game if it brings the generations together. We played it at a family gathering with three generations and loved it. The cards are very sturdy (a little difficult to shuffle, but I assume they will loosen up a little with wear). Overall, it's just good clean fun!"
2,only for cut-throats,"We played two games of this and don't want to play anymore. It is only for the true cut-throat. We just don't enjoy wiping out all of an opponent's bunnies with a single card. The way the winner is determined is little more than luck, so it matters little how you play the game. Very disappointing."
1,We hated it - makes no sense.,"We bought this, thinking it would be a quirky/cool card game to play. But because of the terrible, terrible instructions, we never got around to actually playing it. The instructions are poorly written, and make no sense. We literally could NOT get a game started - I forget exactly why - all I know is the instructions made no sense. I was mad too, because I bought an expansion pack as well. I ended up just throwing it out. Waste of money. Don't get it!"
1,Tedious,"After 30 minutes of reading the rules from Book 1 (yes, there is a second book of rules to read after you finish plowing through the first book), we tried one round and decided that we just wasted nearly an hour of our morning. Pathetically boring, complicated (talk about having to know hundreds of different rules) and it all comes down to a random carrot card. Ridiculous concept. I'm sorry I wasted $$$ on this game."
1,Not great.,The rules were poorly written and the game play seems random and poorly thought out. These guys had a good idea and wasted it on a bad game design. It coudl have been silly and I would have been happy - this is just a BAD GAME DESIGN.
5,Hilariously fun,"Who'd think that a game about killing bunnies in strange ways would be entertaining? Well, someone did because there's this game. And we are so glad there is! We are not a big card or board game family, but this is one game that my entire family will sit down and play for hours on end. The point of the game is to collect the most carrots and bunnies while killing off your opponents. It's hilarious. There are a bunch of expansion packs you can buy that go with the starter game, making the fun last even longer."
4,"9 Yr old loves it, the older kids aren't so thrilled",This is a really cute game and my 9 year old loves it. I think it would be fun with a big group but I (mom) find it kind of boring when just two or three of us are playing. My teenage kids (15 & 17) prefer Citadels and Carcassonne...and so do I.
4,AWESOME!!,"This is an interesting game overall, but a little confusing. After you get the hang of it, you really have a blast. The more players, the better. The cards are also very durable and are coated in a thick gloss, so shuffling is easy. If you have younger kids, this game will not be easy then for them to play. It has lots of complicated rules and holes. Overall, though, a great family game!"
1,"GOOD FOR RECEiVING, NOT SO GOOD FOR SENDING","We heard nothing but good things about the HP 920. So, when our fax machine took a dive, we ordered the 920. We were impressed with the ammount of pages you could send at once, since we send on average of 3-10 pages at a time. When we received our FIRST 920 it started taking 4-5 pages in the feeder at once. We returned it for the SECOND 920 when it started doing the same thing, the whole fax would go through all at once instead of one page at a time. At this point we called HP direct and received number THREE. Well to make a long story short, number THREE is going back and HP has struck out!"
2,Didn't Last Long,"I had my 920 fax for about a year, and it seemed to work just fine. However, for some reason, the rollers started ""clacking"" real bad, and, I got error messages when trying to replace the cartridge (message said it's the wrong cartridge). So all in all, it's ultimately just a pile of plastic junk destined for the trash can. I have taken the unit in to see if it can be fixed, but won't spend over $80 to do so. There's probably a more dependable unit out there than this one."
2,Worst customer service on the planet,The machine was great until it took a power surge. HP refused to help and kept sending me to the toll line for customer service. They sent me a photocopy of the user manual as if I could not (and had not) read the one that accompanied the fax. I eventually had to call my credit card and contest the charge because I could not get HP to even listen. HP refused to let me return it past 30 days despite the alleged 1 year warranty.
3,Don't Play Us Cheap,It wasn't the type of movie I thought it would be. It was more of a musical stage play. It was still enjoyableDon't Play Us Cheap
2,I did not understand this,I purchased this thinking that video would be a good film but I was confused when watching it .
1,precalculus,"I hate this book. It only gives a few solutions, maybe 5 out of a 100 (if your lucky). I don't know if I am doing my work right or not. There is no way to check. Every math book I have had gives answers to odd# questions in the back, this is very helpful to see if you are going in the right direction. Not this book. You can spend hours and not know that you are doing it completely wrong. This does not help if you have 300 problems to do, and a week before class meets."
4,neatly organised and pleasant to self-study,"This is a beautiful book that leads from algebra very smoothly. As a precursor for calculus, it covers all the important topics such as trigonometric functions, identities and equations, polynomial, exponential, rational and logarithmic functions and some analytic geometry. The only topic that it is lacking is probability and statistics.The majority of the problems have real-life applications accompanied by colourful pictures. With an average of about 90 problems in each chapter section, it does a good job of not being too repetitive. The chapter readings are easy to comprehend and well-organised into little sections and examples.Overall this is a great textbook to self-study Precalculus from and I had a painless time absorbing it."
1,Beware If You Need the Access Code for MyMathLab,"If you are purchasing this book for a college class and need the access code (homework assignments are on the CD), beware as it may not work at your particular school. There were other students in class who also purchased their codes from someplace other than the campus bookstore and they had the same issue. Technical support responds within 12 hours via email (there is no phone # to contact them unless you are an educator). However, they are unable to resolve the issue. Therefore we will be purchasing the access code for the 2nd time at the college bookstore so we are sure that it will work. To be fair, Amazon has been more than helpful with our issue and will allow the whole package to be returned for a full refund (can't return the CD by itself) even though it has been opened. However, rather than spend the time packing this up we are going to purchase only the component that we need so we can keep the book."
4,who wants a world where everybody has the same opinion?,"Seems like most of the people who don't like this book don't like it because they disagree with the author's opinions rather than anything having to do with the quality of the writing. There are a million other books about the Doors or Pink Floyd or the Grateful Dead, as opposed to the Flaming Lips (who should be the most popular band in America) or Tomorrow. It's nice to see DeRogatis (who is a fine music writer) discussing some bands who have heretofore been poorly documented."
1,I can't take Jim Derogatis's view of rock music seriously,"First off, I haven't read the author's books, but I have read some of Jim Derogatis's ""reviews"" which IMHO are just downright bizarre. To back up my argument see these ratings he gave for Pink Floyd albums:(He did like Wish You Were Here and Animals)""0 out of 100"" for Momentary Lapse of Reason?""15/100"" for Meddle??""60/100"" for Dark Side?Obscured By Clouds ""15/100"",The Wall ""30"",Ummagumma ""30""""0/100"" for all these(he had a review written, but 0 for the score):Delicate Sound Of Thunder,Pulse,Division Bell,Final Cut(the only 1 I did not like)I think that speaks for itself. Weird."
2,Pure Revisionism,"This book is a revisionists fantasy...the author discounts Cream, The Doors and The Grateful Dead while extolling such unknowns as Plasticland and The Flaming Lips...the book reads like a payola scandal waiting to happen...I imagine that since Jim Morrison cannot buy the author a drink or a dinner that The Doors cannot be considered a heavyweight psychedelic band...Imagine acidheads..The Grateful Dead were not psychedelic!!!!!!! read it at Borders then do not buy."
2,A Limited Overview of Psychedelic Rock,"Overall, a well below average book on psychedelic music. While the author does cover a wide spectrum of psychedelic artists, he gives very little respect to the classic artists of this genre. And he barely mentions artists like The Chocolate Watchband, The Litter, Electric Prunes, etc. He gives no mention of the dozens of great U.K. 60's and 70's psychedelic bands. It is obvious that the author knows little about mid 60's to mid 70's psychedelic music (psychedelic music's clasic period) outside of the obvious radio bands like Jefferson Airplane, Beatles, etc. The 80's and 90's artists he covers are not psychedelic bands at all (The Orb, etc.) but are groups playing an offshoot of true psychedelic music. The author's style and writing technique are very good. But his overall lack of knowledge and history of the subject make this a sub par effort."
2,"Fair reading, but inaccurate history","This is a readable and generally interesting book about some of one rock critic's favorite artists, but for reasons cited in previous customer reviews, as a history of ""psychedelic"" music it is terribly biased and incomplete. In his introduction the author says ""Like any history, this one is subjective."" Well, yes, but real historians strive for objectivity nonetheless, and while there will always be differing interpretations of past events, particularly in histories of art forms, it is not that difficult to identify the major artists involved in the creation of this genre in the 1960s. The author dismisses so many of them that consequently, this isn't a history at all. If I were to write a history of the American Revolutionary period that claimed greater importance for Benjamin Franklin's nephew than say, Washington, Paine, or Ben Franklin himself, no one would take it seriously, and rightly so. This is pretty much what the author has done."
1,Buyer Beware....,"Books about Moism/ any religion seem to follow one of two paths: FOR -or- AGAINST. Books written by 'the faithful' are generally sugar-coated, a whitewash of LDS - Mormon History.There are deep, dark secrets regarding Moism...Things such as the Mountain Meadows Massacre, Circleville Massacre, JS's & BY's Radical statements, Polygamy/Polyandry, etc.Many church GAs are vocal about -regarding ""Patriotism"", 'duty to country' etc., but were notably AWOL from participation in WWII, Viet Nam, etc (are you listening, xxx?). The LDS church, it members & leaders, despite statements about-regarding a supposed anti-slavery position, largely SAT OUT the U.S. ""Civil"" War.Backing a winner AFTER the war's over is so much more Convenient, isn't it?"
2,Disappponting,"Sadly, the author strings events in Corman's life in such a way that you are left not finding any interest in his life, which is sad as Corman has led such an interesting life. His own semi-autobiography was much more intersting and fun to read. The one good point of this book is the rundown of his movies, including intersting facts in the making of them as well as the listing of the major players in Corman's films. Not worth [the $]though."
2,Str Trek II re-released (2009),"Why bother paying $50 or more for this out of print P.O.S.?The complete score has just been released for $19.95. I received mine yesterday and it is absolutely incredible in every way! I compare this release with the re-release of the Indiana Jones soundtracks last year. In addition to the crisp sound and 75 minutes of music - there is a terrific booklet with track by track liner notes and other remarks. I owned the Crescendo release and was very disappointed. It had sub-par mastering that sounded like they used an LP record for source material. But I will give it 2 stars, because it was all we had for a long time - and that's better than nothing at all. I sold it on eBay a while ago. Hopefully FSM will put Close Encounters of the Third Kind back on the market...Well, FSM has answered my prayers - try this one out for size:STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN (Complete!) [Soundtrack]"
2,A Resounding Dud,James Horner's Score is very weak. It is very repetitive and it is spatially lacking in scope sounding rather flat. It lands with a resounding dud. Enough said. James Horner's best work was yet to come. They should have remained with Goldsmith for KHAN.
5,For Anyone Who Likes Music,"The job that James Horner has done with The Wrath of Kahn is incredible. I can't say how many times since this movie came out when I have heard parts of a score 'lift' Horner's superlative movements. You could never have seen the movie and just by listening to the score know what happens. It is almost operatic in it's ability to tell the story. And since 95% of the people who would buy this have seen the movie, so much the better. Star Trek fan or not this is his what he should be remembered for, although his Titanic score will always be more known. This one should have won an oscar. It just doesn't get any better especially when you consider some of the outstanding work by Jerry Goldsmith."
1,Poor taste.,"I didn't get past the first two letters before I felt that I was intruding on something very private that wasn't meant for me to know. I kept thinking about my own love letters and how dear they are to me, and hopefully the person who received them. I have read Blanche Cook's biography about this great women, and I found it fascinating and can't wait to read Vol. II and II. I feel that Streitmatter is exploiting the PRIVATE past of a great woman for his own purposes."
3,The Allure of Gold,"The King's Fifth is a cultural book dating back to 1541, the Golden Age in Spain. It tells the story of Esteban de Sandoval, a Spanish cartographer who made maps for the conquistadors of Coronado's army who were searching for gold in Mexico. After seeing many Spanish soldiers die in their greed to obtain gold, Estaban takes it upon himself to get rid of the gold. He dumps it in a ditch in the desert, and then is punished for not giving the King of Spain his one-fifth of all gold found by the conquistadors. I liked how Estaban finally realized that the blind pursuit of money and wealth is empty and how he rejects the allure of gold."
5,"the King""s Fifth",I really enjoyed the book. It was well written. I felt it also showed the mentality of many of the Spanish explorers and missionaries when they were colonizing America.
4,MCoG,"Have you ever heared of the Mystiriuos cities of gold? Les Mystérieuses Cités d'Or ? It was a 1983 tv show, based on this book, brought by a abnd of french producers, japanese animators (from the nhk) and israeli mucisians (the guys who later on created the power rangers, among other programs) - everyone was facinated with this show. When my brother intreduced me to his old tapes of the show (it was played in my country in the mid 90s) I just coudln't leave the screen. It beats pokemon walking. Anyway, I got a bit nostalgic and went to the library and borrowed the book. All I have to say is that I wish I'd have never done so. It just ruined all the story, the athmosphere &c. &c. Nevertheless, it is quite a good book, so if you are a passionate fan of MCoG, or a real bookworm, this book is for you."
1,Too Political for Kids,"This video was a disappointment. Besides being poorly done, it's overtly political. Do not recommend it at all."
1,piece of JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was a real waste of money. You can't see the buttons, the ear phones are suppose to clip over your ears, they do not stay on. My daughter got so upset with this that I finally went and bought her a different one from waltmart. This item is in NO WAY worth what they are getting for it!!!!!!"
1,It broke within the first couple of weeks,"The volume does not go very high at all, and after a couple of weeks it stopped playing all together. The Bratz boom box did not have a very loud volume either, and the radio never worked."
5,Awsome!,I got this for my daughter who is 11 for her birthday. Everyday I see her playing with it! At first it was a little hard to figure out the buttons but after that she just keeps listening to it!Although I do not recommend this toy for under 7 children.
1,Don't waste your time buying this item.,They simply do not work and if it did work there is no button for changing the tracks.
1,Not for me,These musicians rely too much on electronics in their interpretation of the Bond theme songs. I listened to two-thirds of the album before selling it to the half-price store.
3,I had to find out what happened...and I'm kind of sorry,"I am the kind of person who needs to watch things in their entirety. Even if it's not the best, I keep watching.So I ended up taking Series Two out from the library. Okay, there are funny moments...but it's just so ridiculous. The doctor always knows what's best for everyone, the teacher always clashes with him, they gaze at each other longingly, and then some other contrived situation arises so the doctor can again RUN through the village with his bag and save someone from certain death. In a village the size of Portwenn, how can so many people have such crazy illnesses? I laugh here and there, but mostly I roll my eyes.So with the cliffhanger in mind, I had to continue on to Series Three..."
5,"Great product, as described.","Product is exactly as described - a wryly funny British TV series about a doctor with absolutely no bedside manner (or people skills, for that matter). Highly recommended."
5,No TV series better,"This is right up there among the greatest TV series ever produced. Writing, directing, acting, editing, music---all top notch!"
5,A Family Favorite,"I bought series 1 and 2 and found them both hilarious, heart-warming, and entertaining. I watched several episodes of the first series before introducing them to my family. Now we are all fans. We love British comedies, mysteries, and period movies. So Doc Martin has been a great find; the only problem I see is that there is too few available. When will the next series become available in the U. S.? I would order it today, if possible. The last episode we watched was the one with his parents. We all cried and felt, for the first time, who Doc Martin really is. We only have one episode that we have not watched; then I guess we will start over. Please, oh please! Somebody, make Series 3 available to Doc Martin's U.S. fans.--a fan."
5,can be played on most US players,"Haven't actually watched this season yet, but will award 5 stars based on how wonderful the first season was. Don't worry about ""region 2"", as most American DVD players can actually be reset to accept any region DVD. Found this out from another reviewer in the electronics section. Just go to [...] Once there, enter the make of your DVD player and there will be instructions on how to reset the codes. Not sure it will work for every player made (it does NOT work on Play Stations, btw), but most seemed to be there. I tried it on my Phillips and have successfully played region 1 and region 2 discs."
5,Awesome series,"Love this. So funny, so feel good. Really nails small town life no matter which country you live in. The acting is superb"
5,Doc Martin,absolutely hilarious is the best way to discribe this series. i have all of them to date and plan to continue
5,Cornish Humor at its Finest,Unbelievably funny plot lines - we never know what to expect with the Doc Martin series. Whoever writes the scripts is a genius!
5,Doc Martin,"I LOVED Martin Clunes in Men Behaving Badly and follow him in whatever he appears. This show has him as a doctor in a seaside town. He's grumpy on the outside, floundering on the inside, as far as human relationships are concerned. I've watched the whole series and find it delightful. He's also appeared in ""Demob"" which I haven't seen yet."
4,The Dour Doctor gets even better,"Think this series was even better than the first, which spent much of the time introducing the characters, but not really getting under their skin.Series 2 continues the same themes of the grumpy Doc being exasperated with his patients and totally confused about his own life, but expores the realtionships between everyone even deeper. The Doc also gets a shake-up when a rival arrives in town, so he has jealousy to cope with also.The supporting cast are again brilliant, and most of the episodes can standalone in their own right, although there are a couple that are absolutly hilarious.I wouldn't reccommend this to anyone who was expecting a standard British sitcom or slapstick comedy as they will be disappointed, but to everyone else who enjoys dry British comedy, with some good underlying stories this is a good buy."
5,Love the Doc,The second season was better than the first because of the secretary changing. Pauline was a much better fit for the program.
4,The amazon player could use better features (no subtitles!) but its a great video!,"The amazon player isn't as advanced as the Netflix or Hulu players, but it'll do in a pinch. There were no subtitles, and I don't know about you but with chatty people in the room, I like to have them. Especially with some of the jargony English expressions, which can be hard to catch."
3,Credit where credit is due,"While I love Sally Mayes' work, and always have, I have one major gripe. Actually it's a gripe with the producers, most likely. I think that not calling a song by it's proper title is not only annoying, making it hard to track down the original work, but borders on copyright infringement. This first happened with ""If"" on ""Our Private World."" The title of that song is ""If you hadn't but you did."" Not eloquent, but much simpler to search for!Now we have a wonderful new album by Ms. Mayes. One of the best songs on this album is ""the babysitter song."" however, that is NOT the title! The song, written by Dar Williams, is ""The Babysitter's Here.""Sally, please start giving credit to your sources!"
5,Well Worth a Listen. . .Again and Again,"I had the chance to see and hear Sally Mayes in Dallas when she toured with ""Closer Than Ever,"" and I had heard she'd ""retired"" to raise a family. When I found this recording, I snatched it up immediately, and was pleased to hear that her return to music was well worth the wait. Each song is beautifully performed in front of a deservedly appreciative live audience, yet the album merits re-listening more than most live albums. Mayes' voice is a lush, soulful instrument which is equally at home with jazz, pop, ballads, or Broadway. She puts a delightful new spin on Christine Lavin's hilarious ""Shopping Cart of Love: The Play,"" and I can't get enough of ""My Babysitter."" Fans of great singing won't be disappointed with this eclectic, tuneful recording. With bedtime stories like these, her son is a lucky boy indeed."
5,A truly great CD.,"If it were possible to give a CD 6 or 7 stars, I would give them to this one. There are a lot of great tracks but, for me, the very powerful and emotional ""Scarecrow"" is the best of the bunch. The first time I listened to ""Scarecrow"", I found myself crying. I have now listened to it many times and I still cry every time I hear ""Scarecrow""."
5,Woooooo-Hoooooooo!!,"This CD has become part of my morning ritual. Melissa's last two CDs have been intense (and great), but Breakdown seems to show a wider range of emotions. I love it!"
5,Melissa will always be more than an accomplished musician.,"Melissa shouldn't disappoint anyone with this new album, Breakdown. From the almost haunting tones of Angels Would Fall, to the beautiful strains found in My Lover, this collection is a must-have for anyone who considers themselves a fan of Etheridge's work. Also, if you don't own ""Yes I Am"" yet, GET IT!!!"
5,The best,Breakdown is one of Melissa's awesome cd's but aren't they all. This one is especially touching with the song Scarecrow which she wrote about Matthew Shepard. The songs all carry a deep meaning if you read the lyrics. If you like any of her cd's this one is a most. Simply outstanding. It has been playing 24/7 since I bought it.
1,Down with the Enhanced Version,"I sure would love to listen to this CD, but the way the Enhanced version is set up there is no way to just LISTEN and still be able to work on your PC! An Enhanced version should give the LISTENER the option - this one DOES NOT! Very poor design. Anybody know a way around this? I'm junking this CD otherwise, as it's useless to me."
1,The Grinch Who Stole Melissa's Angst,"I'd love to believe that Melissa Etheridge can't match her first two CD's because she's just too happy now to summon up that kind of edginess...but maybe it's time for her to start her own children's clothing line or cooking show. I was so disappointed by this most recent effort - I find the music predictable, and as the summary suggests, her lyrics seem to be written with the Dr. Seuss guide to songwriting - if it rhymes, it's a go. The more predictable her songs began to sound, the less patience I had for the album as a whole - the only song that grabbed my attention was ""Scarecrow,"" but even that soon became repetetive and obvious. I miss the early Melissa: clever, passionate but not quite bitter, intensely sensual, and never predictable. The only solace for losing this side of her would be if - in return - her life is so satisfying now, she just doesn't have the material anymore."
3,BREAKDOWN...TRULY,"After a hiatus of 4 years from ""Your Little Secret"" to ""Breakdown"", Melissa expirienced many different stages of life, motherhood, divorce, love, and fame(criticism over her lifestyle), some of this would be consider perfect stage for some killer self-written tracks, but Breakdown, found Melissa more tame and less clever than her previous albums, the record it's not that bad, but lacks of innovation or something else, to propell the album to a higher level, the album is just flat, outstanding in the album release cuts Enough Of Me, Angels Would Fall, and the unrelease track Into The Dark. But the rest of the album is soon fogetable, and not as deep as Yes I Am, and not as rocker as Your Little Secret, and not even raw as her debut, no wonder this was the beggining of the end for Etheridge, whose power cleverness returned in her next album ""In This Skin"" but by that time radio has given up on her tunes, so sad. But it's all because of this, not a bad album, just the average."
3,Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining - The Info-Fuzzy Network,'+ 've pts1 ]The book gives an indepth treatment of the topic.'- 've ptsI just hope for 2 thigs:1 ] The book shld have got an appendix giving more info on the back ground needed for some of the key concepts covered in the same.2 ] The book shld have got more links to web sites related to the topic.
3,AUTOGRAPH COLLECTOR,MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS BOOK ARE LONG GONE. I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE CURRENT THAN THIS.
3,Pleasant surprise!,"I had never watched this series when it was on TV but enjoyed all the first season episodes. I noted that the character of ""The Commish"" was based on a real-life Rye, New York Police Commissioner. Boy, I'd like to meet that guy. Enjoy!"
5,Love this Show,"I like this show.It isn't perfect, but fairly family friendly.The DVD picture and sound seem good, no problems so far."
3,Far from The Shield,"The other reviews say that this isn't like The Shield and they're right. This show is OLD. Filmed in 91, it looks like eighties. Michael Chiklis is great as Scalli. A little strange with the east coast accent. If not for him it would have been unwatchable for me. Kinda cheesy compared to today's dramas, without much violence, language, or T and A. Older folks wanting to reminisce won't be dissapointed. For younger people who want lots of action and realism, this probably isn't your cup of tea."
1,Warning - Not end of PR:SPD,"WARNING. If you buy this volume (along with Volumes 1-4) expecting to get the full series, you will be cheated. The series run for 38 episodes and this volume only gets you to episode 25, leaving 13 unreleased episodes and thus no closure or way of seeing how the series ended. I am giving it one star due to the stopping the releases only 66% into the run.All of the Power Ranger DVD releases seem to follow this partial release pattern."
1,R U INSANE ?!?!?!?,"Pay 50-$120.00 for one dvd with only one episode ( run time : 22 minutes ) and 5 minutes of the same bonus features . Yah , if people are stupid or love waisting money when everyone could use it towards buying a game system ( P.S.3 , X-BOX 360 or Wii U ) . These SPD DVDs are short enough to be combined into one whole dvd . Who ever thought making power rangers spd volumes 1 to 5 this short was a freaking idiot ."
3,Sandy Bull: the best guitarist/string player you never heard of,"I was in college in the SF bay area in 1966 or 1967 when I first heard Sandy Bull on the radio...(KSAN, maybe?) when the DJ played ""Blend"", the longest song I had ever heard on the radio to that time. I was mesmerized, stupefied even...I was a guitar player myself, and he quickly entered my Pantheon of guitar gods. My only disappointment about Sandy Bull was that I never had the opportunity to see him live, and in fact, by the time he made the recording at the Matrix, he was probably compromised by a long-time drug addiction, and parts of this recording seem to evidence that. Notwithstanding, his skill was prodigious and he influenced many other players. The re-issue called ""Re-Inventions"" has a great deal worth listening to, and would make a great companion to this live recording."
2,Fond memories of a pioneer,"Sandy Bull made fine music. He played a variety of guitar-related string instruments and wove dreamscapes with them. This album is not the place to be introduced to his work, nor is it the best of his work. For a fan, I am one, it is an interesting bit of lore, a curiosity. Try one of his all-too-few Vanguard releases, especially ""Inventions"" if you want to hear Sandy in full."
5,Accounting Basics,This textbook is an excellent source of accounting basics at the collegiate level. I originally purchased for Meigs course at USC and I've used it as a reference for years...so much so that my book was worn out so I reordered the latest edition...it is even better!
3,"Low key, but entertaining","I'm a fan of Dean Cain's low budget action stuff (""Phase IV,"" ""Breakaway,"" ""Firetrap"") because you can usually count on clear cut heroes and villians. This one feels a little murky, however. It's well produced and does have suspense, but could use a little more action and a little less talking. All in all, a good film, but not one that i will want to watch multiple times."
2,Buyer beware,"This type of album is a problem with buying on the 'net. It's a 'carbon-copy' album by a group of electronic musicians which lacks the soul of Vangelis. In a real shop it would be sold in the bargain bins, on Amazon it's listed (and recommended) as a Vangelis album.Sure the playing's not too bad, but when the originals are out there and easily available from this store, there's no need to waste your money"
3,Close-but not the real thing,"This CD, as the customer's review before mine rightly points out, is not performed by Vangelis but rather by Space 2000. Some of the rendidtions are almost identical to the originals, but still falter somehow-the lack they soul of their creator. Some tracks are well produced such as ""Bittermoon,"" ""West Across the Ocean Sea"" and ""Echoes of Antarctica, whereas the rendition of ""Blade Runner"" is laughable. If you're a big Vangelis fan, this CD is worth having, even if only to compare renditions."
3,"Good cd, great composer","I've read the reviews on this cd and none mention that it is not performed by Vangelis, but by Space 2000. These are very admirable renditions of the Greek Synth King's best offerings, but those expecting what appears to be a Vangelis compilation CD may be disappointed. Nothing can compare to the real thing."
1,Why so expensive?,"I see here that some people are led to believe this is real Vangelis, while it's not. That said, as a Vangelis fan, and not-so-fan of cover versions that add little or nothing to the original music, I have to say that I've heard better ones. But again, why buying an expensive cover versions album while you can get the original Vangelis por much less? People: get compilation albums like ""Themes"" + ""Portraits"" (or ""Odyssey"") and you will get the fresh and unparalleled Vangelis in full splendour, and cheaper."
3,Very Soft,"I liked this Gund Duck but I thought it would be a lot bigger for the price. It was very soft and adorable, but smaller than I expected."
3,It's only a song here.,"This album was released by the prolific Jandek in 1987. The instrumentation for most of the album features Jandek on electric guitar backed by a drummer, but the last three songs features Jandek alone on acoustic guitar. The female vocalist know only as ""Nancy"" sings on several of the songs. This would be the last Jandek album she would appear on, marking the end of what some of Jandek's fans consider to be the ""first period"" of his recording career (although calling it a ""career"" implies that he made money at it, which is doubtful). As for what the album sounds like, it sounds like Jandek's typical brand of ""Uneasy Listening"". Most people will probably find the album to be unlistenable, but it's one of the most popular albums among his fans."
5,heavy duty,"arrived quickly,v.ery easy install.winter front is much heavier than i expected.will have to see how well the stick on snaps stay on tho"
1,Wait for an Updated Version,"This book was written in the EARLY 80's - and for a 90's bride, it is totally outdated. Don't bother spending money on this one until she writes an updated version, which hopefully should be expected soon. With Martha's popularity, you would think she wouldn't rely on this book to lead her into the 90's. Buy Colin Cowie or Beverly Clark instead."
4,Great info though some is outdated,"It's great information for someone planning a wedding. Some old info, but one can change things to make their own perfect wedding."
2,"Not for ""real"" people","This coffee-table type book had beautiful illustrations and good ideas if you're in the market for one of those $100,000+ weddings, but if you're a ""real"" person planning a wedding on a budget, don't bother consulting Martha!"
2,Martha Stewart Weddings,"I was very disappointed with this particular book. I was looking forward to a book with many wedding ideas, however, this book is less of ideas and more on weddings meanings and tradition. The ideas it does share are very out-of-date."
3,French readers will love it.,"Gaby deLourdes-Renoir reviews(a Top-10 Amazon.com reviewer) made us love Martha Steward books. ""Wedding"" is full of extraordinary pictures. You just dream you were there! Will your daughter ever know such beautiful moments? Martha Steward helps you to think ""yes"" as an answer. Just because she explains you how to cut into small pieces a huge ""wedding-cake"" (the wedding party you will have to organize). Chapters are divided into specific subjects that can easily be handled by one specific responsible in your family. In the ""lightning"" chapter, you will discover through artistic (and useful) pictures how to create a cheap impressive range of lights in the garden with yellow paper bags and ordinary candles. All chapters include bright ideas for beautiful people (like you and me...). I love books that make me feel ""I can do it"". Especially when they show me beautiful people a a help in the identification process."
4,Rest a while with this GREAT foot rest while playing the guitar,"A good foot rest when I am playing my guitar. It was quite awkward trying to learn the guitar and having both legs on the same level...I am glad I bought this foot rest to ""raise the standard high."" Thanks for this On Stage.It's strong - sturdy - powerful----right size.Set Back: I believe an improvement would be to add two additional legs to make it a bit more balanced."
5,Dandy Foot Rest,This is a solid little footrest. I was very surprised at how sturdy it is for such a low price. It remains locked in position so when you carry it from room to room it stays adjusted to the desired height.
5,Great for the price,"If you are looking for a foot rest just to get your foot higher off the ground, look no further. This is a well built, basic, foot rest. It does not have a tilt adjustment, but to be honest, I wouldn't use it if it did. The rubber feet are securely fastened. The whole think is made out of a, seemingly, durable metal. It does not wiggle or tip when my foot is on the rest. I am very pleased."
5,FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest,"I had never owned one of these before, or seen one. So, when it came time to look for one I really did not know what I was looking for.The first thing I have learned is that the stand should be small enough to fold up and it should be made of strong enough material to hold up. This foot stand performs both of these tasks.I was surprised how simple the construction was, and how much easier it made playing the guitar. The proper position of the guitar is important to create less strain on the shoulder, wrist and fingers while playing.My main purpose for purchasing this was for my classical guitar playing. I can also see how this could be useful for playing acoustic guitar too, or any guitar that does not have a strap on it.The height can be adjusted so that it is more comfortable for the seat you are using. I would recommend this product to anyone that is playing guitar and interested in posture and position of the body and guitar."
5,"Sturdy Foot Rest, Great Value",This unit is really sturdy (I'm about 6' tall and weigh 170ish). Easy to adjust heights and has a rubber top and rubber bottoms to prevent skidding. Comes at a great low price too.Highly Recommended.
4,"great product, but difficult to collapse and reopen",This is a great foot rest. My only complaint is that it is REALLY hard to collapse and re-open. My hope is that with use it will loosen up because right now it always feels like I am going to beat my hands up getting it open and closed.
3,Decent Item...,"Not designed real well! The hooking mechanism to hold the rest at a certain height is pretty poor. It can collapse fairly easy. Could have used some type of lock in place system. Also, it is small. In the picture it appears almost bechlike in size. It's actually about as big as your foot!"
4,"small, does the job for the $$","My husband ordered this and he thinks it does fine as the footrest for his guitar playing. I think it is so small a footprint that it wobbles, especially on carpeting. It does work, but if you're expecting a serious foot rest then get something more substantial. It's petite, so take that into consideration as well. Arrived quickly, price was right and he's happy, so I'm happy"
3,Top Heavy. Needs a center of gravity.,"It's okay, and the price is right. Just don't move your foot to the side while you're playing, like if you're the emotional type and likes to groove while you're playing; ya know, get your body into it, or this foot rest will topple over. If I had to do it again, I'd look for one with more base stability. Probably one of the wooden ones. But I don't hate it, and I use it every day, just got to be careful. Nothing kills a good solo more than your foot suddenly hitting the floor after resting 6 inches up."
4,This foot rest is quite good,"I like how it has 3 adjustable heights. It's quite sturdy. If you have it up on the high setting, it's not the most stable from side to side. I wish the 3 settings were a bit lower - the lowest one isn't always quite as low as I would like.But all in all, it has been handy and I'm not so sure that there are any better ones out there. The times I've used it I've been glad to have it."
4,Good price. Reliable footstool,"I bought three of these. I keep one in my backpack, one in my practice area and I keep a spare. There are five adjustment rungs on the bottom of this stand so it should easily accomodate all different size players. The black finish is nice because it shows no oxidation or rust as shiny footstools tend to display. Great price for a very necessary piece of equipment."
4,Works for me,"Others have complained of this foot rest's small size, and while more than adequate for my size 7 M foot, I can see where someone with a 12 foot might feel they're doing a balancing act (reason for only 4 stars). As a shorter person, I only need the lowest level setting-and that is short enough. Had another manufacturer's foot rest that almost immediately, within one week, collapsed. This unit appears to be of a stronger metal. So far, about 10 weeks, I'm very satisfied with the product."
2,Base width unstable,"The feet at the base of this foot rest are too narrow. The narrow stance renders the foot rest precariously unstable. This effect is accentuated if the unit is placed on carpet. Pass on this one and spend a little more on a unit with a wider, stable base. The part that you place your foot on should be wider, as well."
4,On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest,"Pretty decent product. Easy to open and close. Son uses this at his lessons but doesn't feel he needs to use it at home. Very portable, folds flat with no sharp edges."
5,Great guitar foot rest,I was very pleased when I opened the package. The weight and heft were indicative of a solid and well made product. The black color is appropriate. A major benefit is the fact that it is easily adjustable to 5 different heighths. The rubber feet on the legs keep it from slipping on smooth floors. It's a good buy. Delivery was also very prompt.
5,Great,The footstool works really well. I don't have a problem with it at all...very adjustable. And not heavy. I can carry it in my Guitar Gig bag when i go to class. Nice and easy product.
5,The Best Web Programming Book Available,"This book has all the latest technologies in an easy-to-read, easy-to-follow manner. It's great for teaching yourself something a new web style, as well as for use just as a reference. I find myself looking for something in the book, and then reading the entire chapter and learning something new everytime. I highly recommend the book."
5,an excellent and comprehensive book on web programming,"This book manages to cover the important facets about web programming. There are many examples for both client- and server-side programming in the text. But many examples are in Java, it might be hard for folks who are not Java-oriented to digest all the code examples."
4,A standard,"This was used in an MBA-level course on ""Development of Web-Based Applications."" The course centered on the management of application development, and the actual web-development component of the course was pretty light. However, I've used this book as a resource before and if you use Java this is a must-have."
4,Get a perspective view,"This book is written by a professor, so be prepared to carry some basic knowledge of programming esp. Java, CGI. Also, the book lacks some important recent developments in the languages. But, this book surely provides a good guideline to better web programming equiping you with ubequitous tools."
5,An excellent overall web programming book.,"Have you ever developed a web page on a particular browser only to find when viewed on another browswer you get a javascript error? This book not only helps you avoid these problems but also explains the differences (compatability issues) between Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator(communicator) all through the book. Overall the book contains everything you need to write a web based application. Everything is here from HTML, CGI, Java and Javascript along with a CD containing source code and examples. Why bother buying 4 books when this book has a good deal of information on all four topics described. I am studing an MSc in Computers and have purchased 12 books during my study, this book has been the one I keep coming back to when I need help. Buy it."
3,Nothing special,"This is not a bad book but it's nothing special. It is difficult to find information in a book with over 1200 pages. It's clumsy. If you want a book on Java, buy a Java book. For HTML, buy a HTML book and JavaScript a separate volume is more handy. Netscape's Devedge and javasoft's pages on the net will give you almost all you need, for free. Often when I search for programming tips in the book I end up with Netscape's web pages in stead."
2,"Outdated, unfriendly","I would be the first person to say that Marty Hall is a gifted writer. His books on Servlets and JSP are my favorite computer books, but this book is far from great. The style is cold, the material delivered too fast with too little explanations and all in all, the attempt to cover everything in one fell swoop fails. I was using the book in a class that tried to cover the material the book does, and as a learning resource it is way too shallow for thorough knowledge, more as an 'In a Nutshell' style instead.If you want a good Javascript book, get 'Practical JavaScript for the Usable Web'; if you want a good Java book, well, look someplace else.Spare yourself a book you will not enjoy reading (and get Marty Hall's 'Core Servlets' instead!)."
3,Great if you're experienced ... pass it up if your not,"The author gives a lot of examples and does a good job of explaining what individual lines of code do. However, if you have never programmed in Java, JavaScript, or CGI before, editing the source code to make the programs do what you want is going to be a huge challenge. It's not impossible, but you need a lot of dedication and a good background in a programming language to get through it. If you learn best by step-by-step examples and doing exercies, this probably isn't the book for you. As the cover states, it is definately a ""hardcore"" book for ""serious programmers."" If you want a book that breaks programming code down into it's individual components and tells you what each of those components do - this is a good book to have on the shelf."
2,"Should be called ""Java"" Web programming","I guess I was a little misled by the synopsis. I thought this would be a book that focused on different manners and methods of writing web server code. Instead, a significant portion of the book is dedicated entirely to Java-related issues, focusing too much on client-side information. I definitely didn't feel this was a well-rounded reference. Also, the author seems to go out of his way to deride the Mac OS and extol the virtues of Windows. I see no point to this except to annoy some of his readers (like me)."
4,Focuses on a good perspective of Web programming,"This is a ""must have "" book for people that having certain interests an experience on Internet programming, want a globalized perspective , whithout losing a in-certain-depth view. Is good buy as it is certainly 2 or 3 books in one:-A Java manual,replete of examples,covering a good amount of topics. -A HTML starting guide. -A Javascript an Dynamic HTML descriptive. -Some words on CGI, etc..."
3,All in one resource pit-stop.,"Wish I would have purchased this title from Amazon... I just paid $50.00+ for this title at a local book store. :( I have found that this book not only reflects the needs of the big $$$ WebMasters.. But also us ""want'a be"" masters also! If your going to be making web pages.. Even with a store bought editor.. This is a MUST have behind the scenes look at what really goes on! I would consider this to be a GREAT tool for anyone wanting to start their own WWW page or inhouse Intranet. T. May,HCDHS IS Dept, Cin.,Oh. END"
5,Bullseye!,"This is a well-aimed book. If, like me, you are an experienced programmer who is looking to quickly learn Web programming, then this is THE book for you. It doesn't waste time with long-winded explanations of what variables are or what recursion is. It assumes you know all that stuff and quickly explains its four topics.I can't vouch for most of the HTML section, because I already knew HTML, but I didn't know CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and they are handled succinctly here in about fifty terse pages, sprinkled with very clear examples.The one exception to the ""adult"" level of explanation is a chapter on OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) for people new to it.1200+ pages for $40? Quite the bargain."
4,Great Programming Guide - Very Hands on,"This book is a great for beginner and intermediate Web programmers. Some advanced programmers might even get something out of it. In depth examples allow you to learn by reading and implementing code. The content packs several languages into one book. You can learn HTML, DHTML, XML, CGI, Java, JSP, and JavaScript all in one place, without having to buy one book for each. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning Web Programming or learning more about Web Programming."
5,"only book that covers CGI, browser-server conversation","I looked in hundreds of books until I found this one that explains how browsers and servers talk to each other. Now I can easily write programs that automate tasks that browsers do, and I can write tasks that talk to browsers. It is a FAT book. It aims to be an all in one. It needs to be rewritten to include the JDK 2 1.3 level features, but the core material still works. This book is full of information you won't find anywhere else. It has plenty of COMPLETE examples you can type and run, even if you don't fully understand them at first."
1,Ok If you like java.,I purchased the book to aid in CGI programming but found just about every chapter uses Java in its examples. If you are not a Java programmer this book will not help you.
2,All style but no substance - no joke,"Employing Emerson/Lake/Palmer sound with a touch of Steve Howe guitar, this is a very stylish album. However, after my compulsory five listens, there nothing that compels me to listen again. If there is an underlying joke to this work, I lost interest way before the punch line."
3,"good music, bad vocals","I love the instrumentals on this disc. The vocals, on the other hand, are bad. To be fair, I don't like the vocalist's voice--which he cannot help. But worse than that are his mannerisms--which he can help. He seems unable to pronounce a word without inserting a y in it: howl becomes hyowl; space becomes spyace; and so on. This is pointless and bothersome. He sounds very much like the justly forgotten Axel Rose doing the same bad thing. Sing naturally, guy. Notice how ethereal and wonderful everything gets when the female chorus takes over. Back on the good hand, though, the percentage of (lousy) vocals is low, maybe 30%. So the disc is very enjoyable overall."
3,If I could just get past the whiny vocals...,"The music on this album is good. As concept albums go, the concept on this one is only fair, but that's never really a problem with good music.But I've almost stopped listening to this one because the vocals grate on my nerves. The vocalist has a whiny, about-to-cry tone in his voice that I just can't listen to for extended periods.If you're into prog, and the whiny vocal thing doesn't bother you, then you'll probably like this one. But don't expect the vocals to be on a par with the rest of the music."
3,wizard keys n stuff but ordinary songs,"I would describe this CD as being good to average , Actually when I purchased it I think it was sitting on 5 stars and people were saying stuff like ""Oh my GOD I Love It "" well I like it but like most glass hammer music it just will not go through to my soul (as much as I want it to) like many other progressive bands can, sure greats chops wizard keys n stuff but very ordinary songs, I`m finding the same problem with The flower kings lately also. I`ve heard most of LE REX (Glass Hammers latest CD) and it sounds to me like they are now on the right track, I`d get that before this if I had the chance again, In fact while I`m here I`ll order LE REX now."
4,"Great album, but not their best","This is an excellent progressive rock album, from one of today's best progressive rock bands, unfortunately the band forgot to take time to focus on the lyrics (which has always been one of the band's greatest strengths). Still, this album goes far beyond anything else out there in music today. This album, as with almost all the GH albums, is a keyboardist delight."
5,A little Deja Vu,"This is an incredible album from the very first note to the last. If you like the prog rock albums of the seventies, this album is a must. I took a chance on it from the reviews and now I am hooked. Excellent musicianship. I can't wait for their next album to come out."
5,Happy I bought it!,"I purchased this for one song, Brook Benton-This Time Of The Year, and really enjoyed the entire CD. Very glad I have this. Reminds me of the 50's!"
4,Likes and Dislikes,"The expand a shelf works well for spices. Previously, I used a turntable but some spices would be ""hidden"" in the middle and I would end up buying a second, unnecessary spice. With the shelf, none of the spices are hidden.The only things I don't like about the product are:(1) I still need to remove a few bottles to get to one in the back, and(2) I had to paste a label near the bottle tops in order to see the spice names."
4,helpful,I used these shelves to organize my linen closet. They have enabled me to not have to search behind other items to find things. Will consider again. Useful product.
3,Organization,"I bought this hoping I could organize my cupboards better. It just seems to be just a bit too tall, so putting items on it didn't seem too efficient. Made more for wasted space. A better design would have made it more worthwhile."
3,the good and the bad........,"I have limited space for spices. I bought this so that I could easily see what I had and get to it. It does make it EASIER but you won't be able to read the label. I have to tell by color of the top, and mental notes of where each spice should be (alphabetical by herb or sweet, etc on different rows) What annoys me is trying to get the spice jar out and knocking the bottles below out of the cabinet. Still better than nothing but if you have room, get a revolving rack or one that goes in the drawer."
1,Takes space away - doesn't create it!,"How does it create space? If you have a cabinet that is 12 inches high, 15 inches deep and 14 inches wide, and put this large plastic item inside it, will that give you more space or take it away? The manufacturers must not be very logical or are trying too hard to sell you something you don't need."
1,WHO IS THIS GUY TRYING TO KID???,This book is full of hocus pocus wishful thinking! More stuff on 'visualization' and 'power of belief' without enough evidence to back it up. I even tried the visualization exercises exactly as the author instructs; you are instructed to throw small objects into a container and watch as your mind magically directs your body to throw them in and miss less as you 'believe' more! (Didn't work at all!!!) Please....how much money did this guy make off this book?
1,This is Music?,"Unfortunately I listened to every track on this album. It was obnoxious, terrible, unlistenable, and contained not one redeeming song. To be fair though, it seemed like the band tried really hard. If you like MTV you'd probably like this, but if you're a fan of MUSIC avoid ""Family Force 5""."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Crunk rock? Yeah it's cute that they want to hang from Lil Jon's balls, but they're like 5 years too late for this rap-rock stuff. Bionic Jive, Nullset, Isolence, Brougham, and Shuvel all did this act better years ago and then gave it up before it got tired. Family Force 5 is the sound of the dead horse beaing beaten some more just when you thought it had been buried. They even have the nerve to rip off the main riff from No Doubt's Hella Good on Drama Queen."
4,A Blingin' Good Time,"If you're looking for good, clean fun, look no further. Also, be sure to check out their new CD, ""Dance Or Die"", out 8/19/08. And if you EVER get a chance to see these guys live, GO! They are pure entertainment both on stage and in the stereo."
2,"""Wanna Talk About God Philosophy?""","I first started listening to FF5 and I thought to myself, ""Hey, this is pretty good!"", so I found more of their songs to listen to. They have a great sound that definitely kept me listening.Then I started listening to the lyrics.I have never felt so retarded from listening to a song before. It felt like the absence of any intelligent lyrics was actually draining the brain cells from my head and making me stupid just by listening to it.They're either attempting to be funny and failing miserably, they're trying to be humorously ironic and also failing miserably, or whoever writes the lyrics is a complete moron. I'm guessing it's the moron one.I also don't know why they call themselves a Christian band. There's only one or two references to anything Christian, one of which is the hilariously bad ""Wanna talk about God philosophy?""The horrible and immature lyrics ruin what was something that had so much potential."
2,Meaningless Noise,"This group seems to be quite popular in some circles. The reason for that is beyond my comprehension.The sound is kind of a heavy metal/rap combination. Although they are billed as a Christian band, one would be hard pressed to determine that by listening to the lyrics. Most are either nonsensical or superficial. One or two might contain some sort of vague spiritual element, but one would have to really be looking for that to have a chance to find it.There are maybe two songs on here that are not terrible sounding. I would certainly not recommend this to anyone."
4,verry good music for teens,The music at first might not seem like a good thing but after listening to the words they promote gods love and understanding and forgiveness
5,SURPRISE SURPRISE,"This album needs to be promoted more. They are not even playing it in their hometown of Orlando Florida. The Reason I bought it is because I heard of them from back in the days, and it is a very good album. I wish that more people got a chance to here this album, because it would sell, sell. Fellas you did a good job bring it own home and promote this thing. I recommend it highly, just maybe add 1-2 more upbeat tunes next time to show your versitility.Favorite tunes are Fly away, and You took your love."
2,Not so bad but not so good either,I played both eq2 and WoW during beta. As a huge eq1 fan I enjoyed way to many hours playing while in college. But eq2 didnt have that same fun feeling like when i first loged onto eq1 and was awe struck.{EDIT}
1,EQ2 failed me a lot,"Bad graphics. I really expected much more with the extreme high system requirements.Bad user interface. Quest-related items and NPCs appear same as normal ones. So u have to EXAMINE everything, have to TALK with every NPC. And there is no instant tips for items. So u rely heavily on the EXAMINE command, but it's hard to use - {EDIT} I just wasted my money. It's not cheap."
3,Read before buying,"EQ II was not my cup of tea. I found the game somewhat unbalanced. There is a lack of people that play on all the servers. Every server has ""low"" population status. I do not not like how the system randomly hands you down spells when you gain a level. It feels like im being babysitted by the game. I started a dark character and found myself somewhat stucked in a ghost town in Freeport. I also made a non-evil character and found myself in the same boat. After reaching level 15 on both my characters, I got really bored with the game. Some quests are impossible to do just by yourself. Other players are scattered out in the game and are not willing to help you if you ask them in order to do these quests. If you enjoy playing in a ghosttown and hearing NPC's ramble about dumb stuff, then this game is for you.Personally, if you are looking for a great MMORPG try Final Fantasy XI Online or World of Warcraft.Sony has failed to bring out the ""everquest"" in Everquest II."
2,As fun as a root canal,"The most tedious, time consuming mess I've ever played. EverCrack fans will love it. I hate it.The bad:Huge zone load times, same poor net code as EQ1, terrible graphics, boring quests, spelling errors, bad NPC acting. The game frustrates and is tedious. Your forced to use online resources to locate things.The good:Really great animations. Nice interface. Great sound. Neat spell effects.Recommendation:Game is not for everyone, definitely not for me. If you have huge holes in your social life, might as well fill it with EQ2 - that's what they made this game for."
1,EQ 2 - Not for everyone - especially if you have a laptop,"I just bought this game, and was rudely told by the Sony tech support person that they don't expect these games to run on laptops and they don't support them. I have a brand new compaq laptop (Athlon 64 chip, 768mb ram, and an nVidia GeForce 4 Go 64 mbyte card in it), and it won't play.If you read the fine print, it says the card must support vertex and pixel shaders - a hardware feature that is not upgradeable. I didn't know what the heck those things were until calling sony tech support.However after playing this game now both in beta and upon opening on my desktop, I don't think I'm missing anything. The graphics are dull and uninspired. The characters look plastic and are proportioned oddly. My male wood elf looks like a woman, with sloping shoulders and big hips. The gameplay also seems needlessly complicated and repetitive.{EDIT}"
5,Most awsome game of the year,Eq II is the best and nestest game of this year i have seen the srceen shots and play the betta for it its a great game for all who like stragey and multiplayer games
2,"Evercrack, revisited","If you're a casual player and/or soloist, move on, nothing to see here. The recent combined combat revamp/expansion (Sep 2005) has completely reversed SOE's changes of the summer, making this a game clearly geared to those who take obsessive gaming to new heights. If you're wondering what that means - a short visit to the official forums should be enough to convince you that the current EQ ""hardcore"" base believes that:a) Casual players, ie. players with real-life commitments, should leaveb) One's real-life success is measured by one's success in Sony's IMAGINARY worldc) One should be prepared to ""work"" in this game"
3,Good game but WoW is much better,Lets stick with the basics.Making a character: fun and with a large variety of of custimization and races.Gameplay:Can be EXTREMLY boring at times (The most a the beggining)and quests somtimes feel like your a mediviel pizza delivery boy or they can be just as bad as grinding.Graghics/interface: Great graghics and interface allows you to almost completly remake your screen.Other:Can only make 4 character without paying an extra $1 per month.Over all this is a good game but if your short on cash then get WoW.
4,Just flat out good,"I have been playing online games for about 2 years now. I have played COH,COV for a while but i cancelled the account because i got to level 50 and there was really nothing else to do. So I go to the store and pick up EQ2. From the reviews i have heard, i thought it wasnt going to be good, but the reviews were wrong. The graphics are beautiful and the game is very fun if you have a team to play with. The only problem is that it runs kind of slow sometimes and lots of lag get in the way. If you dont like playing on teams, dont get this game. Another bad point is the limited character creation. Sure you can just go out and buy cloths, but that sucks up all of your money (the in game money). You cant edit your characters costume at all, just there facial,hair,and body features really. A good point is the PVP (Player Vs Player). Its always fun going out and fighting your friends. So there is the review, I very was satisfyed with the game"
1,Not much Fun - Try {EDIT},"I have been Playing EQ2 for about two or three weeks now. I am up to level 15. I am still fighting mostly badgers,bears,and deer. I am still using the same lame armor and weopons I got around level 8. Each new spell I get is lamer than the last. The zones are pretty boring, with all of the decent monsters mostly in groups of five or six, so they are impossible to solo. Loading between zones can be up to 5 min. long. I have a good running system, and when I run through a populated city the lag is unbearable. The quests are pretty boring too. Run to this zone and deliver this. Run back to the other zone and talk to so and so. Most of the quests are spent running through different zones, so between the running and the loading time lag for each zone a 30 min quest turns into a hour and a half long. I enjoyed EQ1 enough to get up to level 40 before I quit. I doubt I will make level 20 on EQ2. Just not worth the time and energy to play. {EDIT}"
1,Great Graphics! But horrible gameplay! Poor Cust. support!,"When EQ2 came out I screamed horray!!!! But as I played it I felt let down, betrayed, scammed, etc. I switch over to WOW and I am having a good time, but graphics are toonish though.Do not waste your money!"
1,STOP!!!!!!,"Of all the MMORPG's I've played, this by far is the worst. The graphics are a let down, battle control is sluggish, its difficult to find your way around, game control in general just plain out sucks. The tutorial has some confusing parts in it that leave it a bit difficult to figure out how to end it and get on with the game. When you do get going on the game, it is confusing and a bit demeaning to any true gamer that knows what a good game looks and feels like. Go buy Worlds of Warcraft or City of Hero's"
2,"Man, not again","Everquest was a fun game, but no great shakes. I have a level 50 on eq, and umm no im not going to start over again. Well im sure that after all of the ranting and raving that verant hears that they will invoke some sort of transfer service of EQ 1 characters to EQ 2, well that is just a guess, and charge oh, i would say about ($$$) to transfer..."
3,Different from the original,"I have read many reviews about the 'sequal' to the MMORPG to Everquest. It looks like Sony is making it very differnt from the original game. It looks like a game I could very much get into. The only problem is you won't be able to transfer your current toon into EQ2 because of the vastly differnt leveling and classing system. That will make it hard for all of us that have been playing EQ for a while and have high level characters. It's either give up all that work, AND your friend, or play both. When this is realeased, I'll have to make the decision, but I'll probably end up playing both.Keeping my eyes on this game to see how it goes and hopefully it will turn out to be just as entertaining as EQ was."
2,Terrible Game,"So I started playing this game in December. Wow I wish I had not. I used to play the original EQ and loved it. It was a great escape or atleast adventure from the daily toil. However this game is nothing but work and I do not recommend it for those who get stressed easily and are looking to relax.First of all as a 50 alcheimst the crafting system is boringand I dare say not innovative. There is nothing cool about the way this bs stuff works.When you read certain comments and changes from the devs youwonder if they even think your time is worth something.Adventuring is way cooler then crafting and adventuring is likewatching paint dry on the wall. :)So do yourself a wonderful favor, don't buy this game:)"
1,NOT MUCH OF AN ALARM CLOCK,"I bought this alarm clock for my 8 year old daughter to actually use as an ""alarm"" clock. It's not much of an alarm clock. The settings are complicated for her and the first and last numbers on the face are smaller than the middle numbers which makes it confusing for my 8 year old. The sound of the alarm is very faint and wouldn't wake up a mouse. Also, there is no light on the face display so you are not able to tell the time in the dark. Other than that, it is a cool looking clock, but for the price, I thought it would be a fully sensibly functional ""alarm"" clock. Now I have to go buy another cheap alarm clock that will function like a true alarm clock!"
1,not worth it,"I too purchased this clock for my daugther,not only was it verydifficult to set up, but it chimes every hour which I find annoying. And I have still not figured out how to use the alarmfeature."
1,ALARM CLOCK,This alarm looks pretty cool for children around the age of 10 but it is a piece of junk! My best friend has one and the numbers are different sizes. She can't figure out how to set the time OR alarm. The settings are relly hard to figure out. Some buttons are in the back like the snooze button and the lights button. If you needed to use the alarm's lights in the night you would'nt be able to use them eaisly. Hope This Was Helpful!!!
2,Be prepared for a frustrated kid!,"Bratz? Yes, your well-behaved child will be whining like one if you give this to her. Who designed this?Go ahead and lightly push any button in the back - you've either re-set the time, date or the alarm. No matter, chances are you've unwittingly been telling time in calendar mode anyway. That's if you can even read the display. I'd be able to teach my kid analog time-telling before explaining the small first digit design. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,This was Awful!!!!!,This alarm clock goes off all the time and it is very annoying If my daughter didnt like it so much I would trash it! I do not recommend this to anyone
1,"Good God, someone owes me money","Yes, after about 30 minutes, I was able to figure out how to set the time, but thats about it. The instructions were a little off concerning x amount of presses for some buttons that have several different functions, which wasn't very helpful, and the slightest touch to any of the buttons (which are for some reason located exactly where you would grab the clock to move it) resets everything to one o'clock.Not a very useful clock for the age it targets."
4,The 22 Non-Negotiable Laws of Wellness,This was a wonderful insiteful book. Easy to pick up and read and think about each law. Very comprehensive. Covered catagories that I would never considered as part of wellness.
5,Excellent overall philosophy of how to lead a good life.,Material in this excellent book breaks life into important aspects and gives insight on how to maximize your enjoyment in each. Shows how living a balanced life can lead to wellness and happiness. Gives some good practical advice.
5,Great!,"Wonderful Read :) I read it in one afternoon, it has a lot of valid, but obvious points. It seems a bit outdated now though."
5,Taylor Mali fan for life,"Taylor Mali should be knighted, if there were such a thing for teachers. His honest portrayal of the struggles of teaching and the rewards that accompany it are worth reading. I first saw him on YouTube and laughed so hard that I sprayed water all over my keyboard. Yet some of his pieces make me want cry because they so accurately reflect what it means to be a teacher, in charge of the future generations of students that parents don't necessarily know what to do with.If you're a teacher, or have one in your family, buy this book!"
4,not quite perfection,Taylor Mali is a genius but its much better to hear him than read his poems. The book is a large collection of his works. I enjoyed the read.
4,Grande Livro. Abrange todos os aspectos do Taekwondo,Este livro é muito interessante pois tras todos os aspectos do Taekwondo. Só no o considero 5 estrelas de vido ao grau de abrangncia da materia.
3,"IT'S GOOD, BUT..........","AS ONE OF THE REVIEWERS NOTED, THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT FOUR MELODIES IN THE BACKGROUND THAT GET PLAYED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE CD. ONCE YOU LISTEN THROUGH A FEW TIMES, IT SEEMS VERY REPETITIOUS WITHOUT MEANING TO BE SO. I COULD UNDERSTAND IF THIS WAS SOME KIND OF A ""CONCEPT"" ALBUM, BUT IT IS NOT. AND THE SONG ""POLITIK KILLS"", WAS ALSO COVERED BEFORE ON THE AMADOU AND MARIAM ALBUM THAT CHAO PROCDUCED. THE SONGS SOUND NICE, BUT I GUESS THIS GUY IS JUST RUNNING OUT OF NEW IDEAS."
2,Enough Already,"I am a big fan of Manu Chao - not a blind fan. This album has maybe three good songs on it that are then shamelessly recycled twenty times or more. Really! I mean come on - if you just don't have enough material for a complete album, then wait until you do. Don't give me the same cheap drum machine beats with the same rhythms and the same vocal phrasings over and over. It's an insult to a global fan base that would gladly wait a little longer for him to get more inspiration to write a complete album.I know he tends to re-use ideas on the same album, but this is too much - he just didn't care enough to deliver the goods this time."
3,Vamos Manu!!!,"I LOVE Manu. He's definitely one of the most original artist around. I was real excited about this release but unfortunately, I think it was rushed. Most of the the tunes don't have the soul and flava of his previously released albums."
2,disappointing,"It's not a fun listening, the songs are not authentic as on his two earlier albums, but rather annoying."
3,Manu rocks out!,"I'm a real Manu Chao fan and while I originally felt this album was a bit too repetitious, I've gotten to really enjoy this CD more and more since I've had it. It is very fast paced but I really enjoy a lot of the material on the CD. It's another good CD by Manu Chao."
2,And I waited 6 years for this?,"OK-so when I saw a new album from Manu Chao-I wanted to see what he had been up to. I was sorely dissapointed to find that not much has changed. His style is the same and I guess I am not as much of a fan as I was in the past. You might as well buy the older, classic stuff"
5,Manu is back!,"In fact, I guess he never left. I love this record upon first listen - frenetic, guitar-heavy and relevant - manu speaks for the many who are not heard yet he remains optimistic! We continue to dance to the beat and follow his pace. Can't wait to see this record live again - prospect park, NYC this past June was unlike any concert I've been to - including an encore in the rain. Don't make us wait so long next time Manu!"
4,Get it! It won't dissapoint.,"MAnu Chao's hard to digest. He's definetly an aqcuired taste for most of the people: you either like him or not. Even so, it's easy to anyone in the world to relate to his lyrics, specially for latin americans, that's why he's so popular here.This album's great. It's so refreshing to listen to something new from Manu. Radio Bemba was great, but with only a few new songs (e.g. Rumba de Barcelona) he left us fans wanting more... and sheesh! hem ade us wait!!But the wait was worth. La Clandestina is your typical MAnu Chao album, full of latin/flamenco/gypsy/african influences with lyrics that deal with society and political issues.With all the trash music that's produced today in the music business it's always good to count on artist with something to say.Favorite tracks: Me llaman calle, Besoin de la Lune, Rainin in paradize."
1,"For the 100th time, we heard you","I understand that alot of people like this book but I don't think that I should have to be subjected to the torture of reading through this whole text. I had the opportunity of reading just one chapter of this book and it would not have mattered if I had read the whole book. Lyon is repititive and boring and honesltly, I couldn't the book aloud without the temptation to fall asleep. I can't give a book to read instead but I can tell you a book to stay away from. That book is Jesus in Disneyland. This book could have been summarized in 5 paragraphs, not over 100 pages. He says something on one page and then says the exact same thing on the other page except he uses new sociological ways of saying. I think I can speak for all of my classmates when I say, I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME!A budding undergraduate,Derek Martin"
4,It Satisfies,"This is a fabulous score, filled with beautiful passages. It contains what is arguably the best cue from film of all time - 'Stealing the Enterprise', a grand heroic segement that will make your heart swell with emotion. The other great passage is 'Bird of Prey Decloaks', an action cue not completley devoid of feeling. -1 star (should be two) for the puzzling addition of an 80's rock version of the theme and the omision of the escape from Genesis. It'll do though."
4,Great James Horner work on a good film.,"While The Wrath of Khan is my favorite film and soundtrack, The Search For Spock is another good soundtrack by Horner. I recommend it to any Trekker, Horner fan, or soundtrack junkie.While not as transcendent as Horner's previous Trek score, it is still up there with great Trek soundtracks such as The Wrath of Khan, The Final Frontier, and First Contact. I consider it my second-most favorite Trek score. Definately worth getting."
1,Another GNP Cresendo Flop,"James Horner is a genius. The score for this movie puts pressure on Jerry Goldsmith's work in the other movies which is no small feat.Unfortunately, this production is a shambles. The scene from the mind meld which was a brilliant composition and showcased in a recent 30 Year anniversary festival is cut to less than 2 minutes.Many of the pieces have been rewritten to insert flashy attention getting rythms and percussive effects that really distract.I am about to violate my rule of never requesting refunds.Finally, as usual with GNP Cresendo label the engineering is terrible. I get headaches from the thing on all three of my stereos.Find a used copy of the 80's release or just listen to the video tape. I had a copy that was used for just that."
3,Incomplete Soundtrack,"I don't know if anyone realized, but this soundtrack is missing several pieces from the movie--just watch the movie and you'll know the ones that were left out. Thus this isn't an ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"". The same thing was done with the Star Trek 2 soundtrack. Will James Horner ever bring out the complete ones? Who knows?***************Review update -- Sept. 2010I am pleased to discover the expanded score has recently been released. FINALLY after 26 years they finally did it! It can be found at MovieMusic[dot]com -- search for 'Star Trek III' & select the 'expanded' choice. Enjoy!"
2,"Bag O.K., SAMFE shipping a ripoff","This product falls into the category of ""not worth the cost of shipping"" for me. The bag is a basic black nylon bag that is adequate for holding a large yoga mat. The bag was shipped in an envelope via USPS first class mail for $1.35. SAMFE was the retailer that Amazon used for this transaction, so Free Super Saver Shipping was not available. SAMFE charged $7.50 for shipping. I generally stay away from retailers who charge shipping in order to boost their profits, hence the low-star rating for an otherwise adequate product."
1,Not very good,"This is only good if you are going to be driving for a long time. It takes up to an half hour to cool down. You have to have your items cold before they go in, because this will not cool them down. It is more like an ice chest without the ice, not a fridge. If you are going to use for like a lunch box, buy the plug in so you can get it cold before you take in the car for work."
1,wagen personal fridge warmer 10.5 litre wagen el 2296,not very good for australia the power adaptor is not 240v is needed for pre cooling have tried to get a 240v one
4,Does the job.,Drove across country and this unit was great to have. I would recommend it to anyone who does a lot of driving and wants to take alone drinks and snacks. I love that fact that the device could be used for drink holders and an arm rest.
1,hit or miss,I had one of these years ago and it lasted a long time and i loved it. but this one only lasted a couple of weeks.
5,EXTREMELY Pleased!,"I purchased this for our recent vacation. We were going to be on the road for a total of 4 days and I used it to stock sodas, cold cuts, mayo, and (most importantly) insulin. The only down side was unpacking the thing at night and transferring the contents to the refrigerator in the motel then back again the next morning, but I'm going to purchase the optional AC adapter and that problem will be solved. This isn't a refrigerator, so be sure everything you pack is already cold, but everything we packed, even the sodas, STAYED cold."
2,Not so cool,"I purchased this because we had bought a simular, but larger one for those trips to the grocery store and want to keep the cold items cold, or frozen items frozen. I am disapointed that this smaller unit doesn't have the performance the larger one did. My vehicle has air conditioning, so the ambient air remains about 75ish most of the time in the cab of the truck. I've taken to putting a frozen bottle of water into this unit to keep it cold."
1,Unhappy in KS,Husband & I were getting ready to leave on 45th Wedding Anny Trip. Decided to order electric cooler to use so we didn't have to mess with getting ice. Plugged it in to cool down before putting anything in it. Checked it later on and for some reason it was getting hot rather than cool..was set on cool. Cord got hot too. Had to leave at home and used ice in regular cooler. Now WE have to send it to the manufacturer. Guess we should have bought locally..easier to get refund or replaced instead of Amazon.
1,"VERY Weak, One Week","I used this only a few times for a couple of hours each. The power cord failed after one week. As it turns out, the connector on the power cable that plugs into the device had a little piece fall out. Wagon evidently does not have replacable cords nor do they have standard connectors. Why a company would not have a simple replaceable part for their products such as a power cord is beyond my understanding. I browsed the Internet for hours for a replacement, went to various auto part stores, Radio Shack, other electronic stores to try to fix the darned thing but no one had a match.The lesson I have learned is read the Amazon reviews and don't gamble my money.I have had a Black and Decker model that lasted for nearly 5 years and oh how I miss the reliablity and availability of that one."
3,"Good cooler, needs a few improvements","PROS- The cooler cools very well and keeps things really cold. Plus its easy to operate and a very convenient design. CONS- Designed with some cheaper and weak components. If you are handy its easy to fix any of the shortcomings. The first one we got had a bad hinge on the latch. Easy return though. The replacement one's fan went bad within a month of 5 day a week use. The good thing is its very easy to replace the fan. Remove 6 screws from the front and the two that hold the fan to the cooling fins. Replace with a computer case fan, I used a 120mm rocketfish fan that ran about $15. It now runs almost silent and works better. The cord does get warm in the middle but not near nor on the plugs on either end. It does not get hot but I am keeping an eye on it. If it does start concerning me then I will either shorten the cord or replace it with a larger gauge wire, both of which are an easy fix."
2,Not enough heat,"The unit has everything I need except the main thing which was heat. I bought one and tried it for a week. It never got past 85 degrees. I returned it and got another one but I had the same problem. I never tried to use it to keep something cold. I left it on for hours, then the whole weekend with nothing changing. If it worked properly, it would have saved me money since I'm a truck driver."
4,works just like I wanted,"I bought this as a replacement since my first I broke my first one. I use this cooler for four days a week, it is on the entire time and works just like I wanted. It keeps the items nice and cold and is very quiet. I would recommend to anyone who need one."
4,Wagan 10.5 Liter Fridge,As delivered the power cord for the Fridge became very warm on the point of melting the plastic insulation. Contacted Wagan Cusstomer Service who reconized that there was a problem and sent a new power cord. Using the new cord the Fridge performed as expected and we are very happy with the product. Wagan provided excellent response.
1,"Good Product, Poor Quality","I purchased this product to keep items warm while working at job sites. The power cord failed after 4 months of operation. I found that taping it down at the cooler end worked, but after three weeks the cord completely failed at the cooler end. The cooler only sat in my car and wasn't moved much. Other then being defective, i'm not sure what caused the cord to fail."
3,interesting but sometimes too poor scan quality,"it's great to have a B17 flight manual, but unfortunately, some pages are scanned in such a poor quality that the text is barely readable... also bad that the color was removed on some of the sketches.Still a must have for aviation enthusiast!"
2,Book of Low quality scan,"This is a book of low quality scans, the words are sometimes blurry due to the jpeg scan they were created in. Some of the first letters of words on the far sides are cut off from the scanned image."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I'm a little bit disappointed with the quality of the pictures and type in this book. In some cases, one cannot make them out. I don't regret getting the book, as it's a conversation starter, and in most cases it's readable. There are several websites that offer the same information for free as a pdf file, which I use when I can't make out the typing in the book. I have to give the publisher some credit for offering a book, which isn't much in demand."
5,The best !!!,"I recomend this product to all the people who have a computer and something to conect in a USB port and they dont have a USB port, so you must buy this product because is the best you can buy. it's simple you only need to conect this adaptar into a PCI port and you now have 2 USB port."
4,Excellent with few bugs,"Overall I am happy with the T45 and recommend it. It is very straightforward to install and get started. It is not ideal if you don't have a dedicated phone line for fax, sometimes it fails to recognize incoming faxes, mainly from old style machines that don't constantly send a fax beep ahead of answer. Also setting the fax software is problematic, there is no obvious way of deleting a wrong entry into the phone book"
5,Excellent Printer with Low Ink Cost Per Page,"I've had this printer forever and it keeps chugging along. I recently purchased a new HP All-In-One, the HP L7780, to get its wireless capability, higher print speed, flatbed scanner and Windows Vista drivers. Although the new printer has better print quality and wireless, the cost per page for ink usage is almost double that of the T45.I was shocked when I did the calculations, but they are correct. If you need a printer for all round use, but not necessarily photo quality output, you can't beat this old classic. Drivers for the T45 are available up through Windows XP."
3,Interesting but light-weight and pretentious,"This book will probably appeal more to those persons who want their opinions of Pacifica confirmed, namely that it is somehow, as one of the books blurbs puts it, ""heroic"". In general the content of Pacifica is entirely conventional, and in no respect is it courageous in the style of its programming or inventiveness of presentation. This book is something of a cheerleader rather than anything like an analysis of the station's content, and one must assume that a better book by a more serious scholar will eventually be written."
5,Inspired performance: a truly great recording,"Colin Davis directs the definitive performance of the Midsummer Marriage. Based on Covent Garden's second production of the Opera (it give the premiere), it is a performance which throughout communicates with huge conviction, intensity and Tippett's strange but compelling modern myth. If you treat the story as a mixture of ""the Magic Flute"", ""The Tempsest"", English folk tales and a 1950s domestic drama, you won't be far off. Singers, chorus, orchestra and most of all, Sir Colin Davis, leave one with no doubts about the greatness and universality of this work. Having bought the LPs (on Phillips) many years ago, the release by Lyrita on CD was greatly welcome. Highlights are difficult to choose in such a wonderful recording, but try Sosostris' aria in the last Act, Mark's Act I aria and the climax of Act III in the final ritual dance where Mark & Jennifer are mystically transfigured to music of power, not to mention considerable vocal vigour. Outstanding."
1,Bummer Recording Software,We had hoped we could use this very cheap software to make recordings for grandparents and friends. Neither I or my two teenage children could get this thing to work. I wouldn't recommend it to the novice.
4,What a find!,Had specific request for something like this and couldn't find in my area. Ordered 2 of these (different sizes & colors of blue & yellow) as gifts and recipients are very pleased. Good ordering experience for me with this company and amazon.com.
1,Disappointment,"This raincoat has excellent weight and really kept me dry the one and only time I wore it, but the chemical smell is so strong. It reeks and causes my eyes to burn. I've tried washing it repeatedly, used an odor neutralize etc. and nothing works."
2,Good Item but incomplete Specification,Too long to wear.. I would have loved if they put the complete specification. Also the item has a very strong smell of something
4,pretty good,pretty good stuff we got here... using them for my digicam and they last thru a helluva lotta shots
1,The editiorial review is misleading,"The review states that the ""unit can be plugged into any 100- to 240-volt outlet (assuming the plug fits in the socket)"".However this is WRONG. According to Olympus you also to have to purchase the 220 volt cord. CB-40SE 220 volt AC cord for B-40SU."
4,Part of a Good Deal,The charger works as it should.Would be nice if it came with screw head slots in the back of the unit to hang it on the wall. Or maybe my desk just has to much junk on it One real downer as far as I'm concerned is the fact you cannot purchase the ni-mh 1600mAh batterys that the unit is supplied with or at least thats what I was told by customer service.
5,Outlasts All,"I've had my Olympus charger and the same batteries for over 6 years now...and they have outlasted 3 sets of Panasonic, Kodak and Everready rechargables....that I've had as backup sets...I won't buy any other brand for my digital camera again...these are by far the best"
4,Good Recharging Unit.,"This is a good recharging AA battery unit. I own both this one and the Kodak K1000 unit. ( AA battery usage in my household/business is rather common). This unit works just as fast as the Kodak unit, if not faster, and has most of the same features. But I like the Kodak unit better.The storage space of the device is very important to me. I don't like carrying around dead weight that could be eliminated. The Olympus unit is compact, EXCEPT for the extension cord, it takes up more room than the unit itself. The Kodak K1000 is a wall mounted unit, that does not require a cord. It fits perfectly into my camera bag, without any hassle. I've never had a ""loose"" wall outlet attachment with the Kodak, if I did, I would tighen it by pinching the plug slightly together.This Olympus system and the Kodak system both work very well. Both are compact, both recharge quickly. My preference is the Olympus at home, and the Kodak on the road."
4,Excellent Recharger,"Works as advertised: I was able to recharge the batteries in a couple of hours..For international travelers, I recommend buying Olympus 200V cord as pointed out by another reviewer OR buying an generic electrical outlet adapter from you local Fry's Electronics ... .The reason it's not 5 stars is that the user's manual does a poor job of explaining how this recharger can be used overseas.."
4,Spare set of Batteries?,"I just got the this product. I am using it with my FujiFilm FinePix 1300. I can already appreciate the added longevity to my camera use. Even thought the directions say to only use with Olympus products, it seems fine with the Fuji. BUT where can I buy a spare set of batteries? The manual also said to use Olympus rechargeable batteries, but I cannot find a place or address in the manual to purchase a spare set..."
3,Not that great,I stay in India and bought this specific charger only so that I can use it here. But I later found out at that the kodak charger set is also availabe in the 220V input and in addition to the NiMH batteries that can also charge the NiCd batteries. The B40SU can howerver only recharge NiMH batteries. now i will have to buy a separate one for the NiCD batteries. The B40SU is light weight and charges ok but would have been ideal if it could also recharge NiCD batteries like the Kodak one.
5,Great Battery Charger!,"I bought myself the Olympus charger set and like it so well I just ordered another one, for my son. My camera came with a charger but no instructions. Tossed it, and now only use the Olympus charger. Great price too, at Amazon!"
1,Please disregard this review if you enjoyed the first book,"However if, like me, you didn't really enjoy the first book, but you have a vague desire to find out what happens and a vague hope that the series will improve, I suggest you give up now. As in the first book, the world is well developed, the book is well written and there are some interesting ideas. But the characters continue to be annoying and the plot continues to dawdle. I gave up on this book halfway through, which is probably the worst thing I could say about a book."
5,"Part 2 of the greatest, and least known fantasy series ever!","This book is really really good, and is worth every penny. It has all the classic elements of fantasy novels that we love. Strange religion, magic spells, mythical creaures, and powerful ancient artifacts.The is the second book of the runespell trilogy. The first one being ""Runes of War"", and the third one ""Runes of Socerery"". Although this is the second novel I recommend that you read it first. It will draw into the world of Belbidia faster than the first one. After that read the first one to fill you in on the details that you didn't understand, for lack of knowing the character's past history. Then proceed to read the dramatic and explosive conclusion in ""Runes of Socerery"" This series,is perfect for anyone fond of Raymond E. Feist's ""Riftwar"" series."
4,More fun with them than without them,"I bought this kit for my Kodak DC290 and it's definitely worth the money. The only disappointing thing is that, when using the flash with the Wide-angle there tends to be a shadow in the lower left corner of the picture. Apparently, the position of the flash on the DC290 and the length the lens adapter + lens causes this."
1,Bad stuff,I bought the pack for the DX3600 Digital camera. I needed a lens adapter as the threads were not the same size.And it was bad. The distortion at the edges of the picture are really unacceptable. The worst is the Wideangle it is really really disapointing. The 2 little close focus lenses were ok. really fun that I could get as close 2 cm to an object.The teleconverter is not as bad as the wide angle but still unacceptable. Maybe this lens were not made for the Kodak DX3600. But they were what were recomended to me.I dont know about the other Kodak Camera models but if you have a DX3600 ( and probably the DX3500 as well) Dont go near this pack. It is really BAD!.TW
2,Not So Good,"I have the DX4900 and have been very impressed with it. The Lens were not nearly as good as the camera.The Wide Angle Lens had extreme barrelling and the edges were very out of focus. This is deffinitely a specialized effect lens (i.e. Kodak's example is looking up in the forrest at the tree tops) not an everyday lens (capture a familly event).The Telephoto Lens worked fine, however it was very dark and not very suitable for flash photos because of the darkness (the directions said to adjust the settings on camera, but it was still very dark). I haven't tried it in good daylight conditions.Haven't tried the +10 +7 Lenses.All in all, I can't recommend spending $[$$$] for the lenses."
1,Do not buy it,"I've tried to use it with my DC-280. Wide angle and telefoto are very bad. Distortion, huge rainbow, blure, unfocused. If you do no consider these as ""spetial effects"" do not spend your time and money. Other two lences are great. Perfect for macro photo."
4,Lens kit adds more functionality,This kit worked great! It extends the features of your camera similar to what you may have been used to with 35mm cameras.
1,Doctor of doom,"I've followed the instructions VERY carefully. The results have varied from no improvement to making the disk worse. I'd guess there may be a very small percentage of cases where the device is able to remove just enough surface to eliminate a defect, without destroying the disk. However, if the defect is too severe, it won't help, and if you go too far it will destroy any disk. I rate the device as worthless. I am suspicious that some of the favorable ratings have been entered by people associated with the company that sells it."
1,"Great idea, but pray before using it.","I know several people who work in stores such as GameStop and Software Etc., and they all use devices similar to the Game Doctor to refurbish used games. Unfortunately, the Game Doctor does not come close to the effectiveness of the professional models.I have personally tested the Game Doctor and Skip Doctor on several CDs and DVDs. While the discs no longer have scratches on them, they also are now utterly useless to me. For example, I have tried this on two Xbox games, Halo and Dead or Alive 3; both of those discs are now completely ruined. The discs will not even boot up on most Xboxes now.The same problem has happened with CDs.By following all the directions to the letter, I have now ruined three games. (I am stubborn.) Stay away from the Game Doctor. Just go to your local music store to have them resurface your discs; you'll save yourself a lot of pain and money."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,"Game Doctor was a huge waste of money and a major source of frustration. Not only did in NOT REPAIR my scratched discs, it actually made them worse! Digital Innovations should pull this item ASAP!"
1,"Abrasive, destructive and worthless.","If it wasn't for the DiskDoctor's ability to completely destroy any disk it contacts, I would say it had no appreciable use. But, it does have the ability turn something useful into a hockey puck.I attempted to repair six separate slightly scratched Audio CDs and discovered that a slight audio hiccup had been transformed into complete uselessness. I even read the manual and tried the various techniques they recommend. In my most successful test, only the first 12 of 16 songs would play. Two thirds repaired isn't repaired at all.I recommend against purchasing this product. You could do better with a little jewelers rouge and some elbow grease."
1,it works occasionally,"i bought this to repair a game i got for free that was scratched up to hell (didn't go through the top though). i used it on both discs (it was Red Alert: Retaliation for the psx) and then it worked pretty good, the only thing is that i still don't get music. i then went on repairing my brothers pc games, after the second one the strip that grinds down the protective layer was ruined and started scratching the disc. The free replacement wheel had its strip fallen off due to using crappy glue. Don't buy this, it'll eat up way to much money and can destroy your game CD!"
5,A gamer's must,I used the non-electronic Game-dr. for a year and had to buy the electronic one. If your a gamer and want to resurface your old scatched cds I highly recommend it. Most of the pople who gave this bad reviews probably resurfaced it too much or didnt buy a new resurfacing disk. All my games and Cds that didnt work work excellent now.
1,It is a fake.,"When I bought this device, in the description of product they post that this item was going to work with any kind of CD,DVD, etc. but when I tried to resurface my Gamecube discs it was useless because it is made to resurface discs of standard size not mini-discs. Then I tried to resurface a music CD and it did not work, please do not believe all the things they post about this device."
1,It sure didn't help my Metal Gear Solid 2 Disc,"This is not a review of incompetence, for I am not careless with my discs. Understanding what a piece of junk the PS2 is to begin with, I found a large, circular scratch that the disc tray had created, considering the scratch had encompassed the disc and had been perfectly circular, I know that I couldn't have created it. I followed all the instructions given, and I found that the results I had gotten sound similar to what is said on this page. The codec conversations didn't work before I used the Game Dr. but now the game doesn't work at all. Because I think this is a problem with the PS2 (it doesn't read my DVD movies anymore, no matter what condition), be sure not to use this product if you own a PS2, particularly if your system is over a year old, as that is where most of the problematic consoles lie."
3,works but ahhh,This game doctor is just a simple game polisher the liquid they give u is either water or brass polish because wen i used it on my final fantasy x it did work but it shaves a very thin layer off that means if you have big scratches dont buy this.
3,Sometimes up...Sometimes down.,"I too have a disc doctor, though mine is a musical disc doctor. As such, I feel that there is little I can add that is different from the other reviews. However, I do not feel that this product is a waste of money or a hazard to your CD collection. It is a simple, basic use tool to give you hope of MAYBE...POSSIBLY bringing that destroyed disk back from the edge. I used the cleaner on a bad copy of a SEGA dreamcast Skies of Arcadia(a good game too) and it smudged the whole thing up and made it more unplayable. But the numerous music CD's I have used it on have come out better from it. Just understand, once this has been used on a CD, it is on limited time. Your best bet is to fix a CD then copy it, assuring it survives somehow."
2,Game Doctor Is Not For Simple Cleaning,"The Game Doctor is not for simple cleaning of discs as advertised. ...this system actually removes a layer from discs, and although that process may salvage discs with serious surface flaws, it can also render dirty discs unusable. I tried it on my Halo disc for Xbox, thinking it appropriate for removing finger smudges, and it rendered it inoperable--... In short, use tap water and a lint-free cloth for cleaning dirty discs, and save this for use on discs only when you have nothing to lose!"
1,"Save yourself some time, skateboard on your favorite game.","I bought this to make my X Box game less apt to freeze during play. After running disc through the grindstone, it was totally unplayable. You might as well use sandpaper to remove smudges from your discs."
3,"Dont know, please tell truth","CAN THIS THING REALY DO ALL THAT IT SAYS? THE OTHER ""GAME DOCTOR FOR PLAYSTATION 1 MOST PPL THINK IT IS A PICE OF JUNK WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE? SOMONE PLEASE REPLY WITH ANOTHER WRITING THX!"
1,Lame Doctor This Sucks,I agree with all the other bad reviews. Spent the money on the doctor and it made 2 discs worse. Followed instructions to the letter. I'm gonna sue for malpractice!!
4,Works great!!!!!,This works great. I had a copy of FFX and it had really deep scratches and froze up on the movie parts. So i got this from a rumumge for a dollar and tried it. You have to hand crank it so it gives excercize to you fat single gamers. After using it i popped it in and the game worked like i just bought. Its worth the money buy it for a handful bucks or buy a new copy of GTA vice city for a dozen handfulls.
5,2 Copies,I have 2 copies of this book-one for home and one for traveling. Very good guidelines to help get started with the mentoring process.
3,We used this for an Adult Woman's Bible Study,"It had many good points to it, however Ms. Peace's Church and her opinions of the Bible verses are not all like our Church beliefs. We did become closer as a class as a result of this study, but about half of our discussions were about how we interpret certain verses or how we mentor other women as opposed to how her church does. We tend to pray more and wait on the Lord's lead before jumping into someone's life to offer advice, give direction, or point out a wrong. If the woman in question asks for advice on how to do or how to handle something of course any of us would be glad to pray with them and help them out in any way possible."
1,Not worth it.,"This book was a big, big, and I do mean big disappointment, the inaccuracies are numerous. And what's more is that most of them could have been caught and corrected had they indeed done some research just on IMDB alone. So pass this one by and don't look back."
2,Errors,"I collect John Wayne movies and have seen every one, especially the early westerns. When I read in this book that he sang in ""sixteen"" movies as ""Singing Sandy Saunders"" (Pg 54), I completely lost interest. He sang in a COUPLE of movies, and as Saunders in ONE. I believe the sixteen their referring to are the Lone Star films. I expect a book to be FACTUAL, and when I see outright BS from an author who obviously never saw the movies, I dont really care to waste time finishing the book. I expect a book to be a work of ACCURACY, why else bother to write it except for the money? I do not recommend this book, there are others that accurately depict his life."
4,GOOD READ ON THE DUKE,THIS BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND WRITTEN SO ITS EASY TO FOLLOW. YOU WILL DISCOVERY THINGS YOU DIDNT KNOW ABOUT DUKE WAYNE LIKE HOW HE CHOSE JOHN WAYNE AS HIS SCREEN NAME AND WHO HIS REAL FRIENDS WERE PLUS LITTLE TIDBITS ABOUT HIS YOUTH BEFORE HE WAS JOHN WAYNE.VERY GOOD BOOK
5,"don't bother with the reviews, just buy the damn movie!!!","Oh my God! this movie is so freaking hilarious! If you've ever seen an episode of the kids in the hall, you should already know how funny the show is. This is just a longer unedited show with no commercials! Comedy Central cuts out sketches to make room for advertising, so there's more sketches in an episode! Plus, as an added bonus, none of the content is edited! It's hilarious! Don't waste your time with the reviews, just buy the tape!"
4,"If you love the show, buy this tape!","Some of the funniest sketches are in this 4 episode video. All the stars best characters are in it. Buddy, the Headcrusher, Cabbagehead, Sir Simon and Hecubus, the list goes on. A must for any KitH fan."
1,Slow and plodding,"Slow and plodding, this is a difficult book to read; it isn't really so much a bad book as it is a pointless one. Most of the traditional elements are here with a few changes but its all been told so many times before in such better ways. If you like Arthorian legends try Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy instead (or the Once and Future King by T.H. White if you want something more traditional or Arthur Rex if you want to laugh your head off.)"
4,Spelling Tips and Tricks! Fabulous!!,I wish I had known these tips and tricks when I was a kid! Great ideas for teaching/learning... Great book. One complaint: I would have liked more reproducibles and ready to copy worksheets.
3,Phrases useful for business in Spanish....,"This audio CD collection contains phrases useful for conducting business in Spanish. The focus is on hearing and repeating phrases, without explanation of grammar or verb conjugation. Most entertaining were the hints for getting out of an awkward and unwanted advance from a spanish speaking male business associate... ""Will you wife coming to dinner too?"" or ""I'm sorry I am expecting a phone call from my husband at the hotel later"" (Whether true or not.) I think Instant Immersion Spanish is much better for the money."
1,Jess Franco's Vampire Lover's: Double Feature,These two films were a complete waste of money. They are beyond bad. I Do Not recomment it to anyone.
5,Tabletop carnage,"Warhammer 40K allows you to build up an army and send it out to annihilate someone elses. You learn a lot about probability and min/maxing while playing this game. Basic math skills and common sense are required. Depending on large your armies are, which scenario you play (described in the rule book), and how experienced the players are, a game can last quite some time. It's great fun to collect an army, paint it up, then send it out to the fields of battle. Unfortunately, many models are made of plastic and tend to have odd bits protruding from them. If they are not carefully stored and handled, these pieces can break off. Also, the little dice that come with the game are easy to lose. On the plus side, the special dice are of normal size. The box comes with some Space Marines and Dark Eldar, rules, terrain, dice, and other game essential stuff. Basically you have enough stuff to play a test game. After that, you will need to go out and start collecting a proper army."
5,The best Wargame ever!,"WOW! This deserves an extra star because this is an execllent game. I thought it came in metal pieces and when I found out it was plastic I got upset, But my dad told me with a little effort I could do it. Well.....My first models I painted and allready put together, they did not look like the picture. Later on they got closer and closer to the picture( I am a guy with no pacince and NO craft skill what-so-ever ).It takes a great deal of time. The game play is Superb, tatical, and FUN! It takes a couple of days to read the manuel to learn, but it is 100% Worth it! It is THE best wargame. I play other games like Magic: The gathering, D&D, Battleteck, Star Wars, and Young Jedi. I recomend this game for ages 14 and older. This game is also VERY VERY expenicive. Think twice befor buying if you are someone with a low budget like me ( cause I'm 14 ). I know I will be playing this game for a long time!"
5,"Very fun for a role playing game ,I enjoy it.","This game is very interesting and fun.Whether your an adult or child you'll enjoy this game.For you parents,who are worried that since it's a warfare game your children aren't getting to learn anything ,they are.You have to read books to learn about your army(s),and you have to think up a strategy so you have a succesful attack."
5,"Warhammer 40,000 is the best miniature game in the world!","I've been playing this game for 10 years now, and it's still fun and challenging. Players create and paint armies of toy soldiers and then take them into battle against their friends. It teaches strategy, sportsmanship, and creative skills. I can't say enough good things about this game!"
5,the best game ever!,"this game is by far the coolest game ever made. games workshop is a genius for making this game. this box comes with 2 armies, space marines and dark eldar. it also comes with everything u need to play the game. the characters you get with the game arent the best teams but there good to start with. i play with an army called chaos. overall i give this set 5 stars."
5,Da Warhammer game,This is an amazing game which allows you to blast your oppositions butt off all from the safety of your living room. Watch as your army grows and you can finally beat your best friend at something-what a blast(joke)
5,Fantastic,I recently discovered the Silos and they rock. I've been listening to rock for thirty years and these guys are good. The cd gets better and better. With all the crap out there this is a must have!
3,"+1/2 -- Solid set of alt.country, power pop and more","Nearly two decades into their career, and now essentially a vehicle for singer/songwriter/guitarist Walter Salas-Humara (co-founder Bob Rupe having departed before 1998's ""Heater""), The Silos continue to weave their early alt.country roots (ala ""Cuba"") through the basic three-piece (guitar, bass, drums) rock sound they've come to on recent albums. In addition to straight-ahead power pop, guest players help the Silos flesh out mandolin-lined waltzes, acoustic and steel ballads, and synth-string lined soul. It's not particularly revelatory, especially considering the band's been on this wagon for so long, but it's another very solid set that's sure to please fans."
4,a great surprise,if you like randy rogers studio disc you will live this one. this disc really brings out the bands true talent-playing live. it is probably one of the best live disc issued in a long time. i believe you will hear great thing from this band in the near future (outside of the state of texas).
5,GREATTTTTTTTTTTTTT,GREAT TEXAS RED DIRT MUSICTHE MAN RANDY LIVES ONLY 26 MILES FROM FORT WORTH AND TEARS UP PEOPLE WHO JUST LOVVVVVVVVVVVE HIS MUSIC.THE GUY IS BETTER THAN ANY R&R; BAND EVER PRODUCED IN OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS!!!!RANDY IS GREAT TO LISTEN OR GO SEE...
4,"Slightly dated, but very useful overall.","Originally published in 1966, this book starts out simply from the very beginning with taking measurements, supplies necessary, and a measurement chart.Although some of the clothing styles do not follow modern fashion trends, the book gives enough information to allow the beginning sewing enthusiast to combat this and alter to any desired shape. Many of the shapes are timeless from the start, including a-line skirts, simple jackets and coats, and shirt styles.It's a very bare-bones style of designing which can help someone achieve a more versatile wardrobe with simple steps and easy-to-follow instruction. Diagrams are clear, and the book lacks a lot of technical jargon that could just prove confusing.Making clothing without a pattern in any case involves a little trial and error, and this book helps to eliminate some of that and streamline the process."
3,Gems & Minerals of Washington,"This book is reasonably good. It has lots of good information on identifying gems and minerals and includes pictures.However, the pictures are only black and white which really detracts from identification. I would much prefer color photos.Still the book is worth the money as the author (a geologist) is very knowledgeable. He also reveals numerous locations forhunting various rocks, gems and minerals."
2,Indepensible text for this topic,"Michell - the author of a text on this topic - has here provided a lovely picture book with careful commentary on this spectacular art. Prints are attractively reproduced and well chosen, and the writing is excellent. Highly recommended to anyone exploring the topic."
4,Works well.,Great stove stand for the weight. It does however melt the snow underneath it when cooking more than 10 minutes.Just make sure you watch that as it could tip the pot off if the snow level is not maintained.
1,La fanciulla del West,"I didn't purchased this DVD, but they sent me it. I sent back the DVD and they did't answer or sent back my money!!!"
1,Freeplay is Better,"If you're going to buy a crank flashlight, get the one from Freeplay. It may be more expensive, but it's well worth it. This one has an ok light, but just feels uncomfortable in my hand. And I can't return it just because I don't like it, so I'm stuck with it. I gave the other ones I bought away."
2,Fire Blower,"Works great but very short lived (less than a year) because of dry plastic gears. If you want to take it apart and lube the plastic gears (as I did), it will last a bit longer.Update: Taking it apart and lubing the gears with a heavy grease has worked quite well. It got through a cold winter of daily fire-starting and does a great job of that. So, I bought another one for a friend. They were listening to the reviews about dry gears and have lightly lubed them. HOWEVER they have now used glue to prevent disassembly and the light lube they used is no match for the heavier grease that I used! You can open it up enough to insert a spray can tube inside. Lithium spray lube did help, but without the grease it won't last long."
1,Poor Quality,"I got one of this and only last for about 3 bbqs.Good idea, very low quality (made in china)All plastic parts."
1,Blown Money,"I bought one of these blowers from a local store and it worked pretty good for about a month , after that it started getting very hard to crank. I thought maybe someone dropped it or over cranked it so I ordered a couple of them from Amazon.com. When I received them right out of the box they had the same problem, you can barley crank the thing. Would not recommend this to anyone."
3,3 stars for longevity and 5 for its idea,"I love the grill blower, and works great.My only complaint is that this model is already giving out after about six months.I will purchase another one, but I will get the beefier version and hope its internal gears are of a higher quality."
5,Works great!! A must have for fireplaces!!,"I just want to say what a great product this is. We have used it quite a bit since we received it and love the ease of use and how great it blows the fire. We will never use anything else for our fires again. It's light weight, blows fantastic and never lets us down. I ordered some for gifts and everyone says the same thing. What a great fire tool! No more bellows for us!"
5,Works great... when you don't work it.,"This is the 3rd one of these that I have purchased. One for myself, my Father in law and a friend. pretty sure I'll be buying more as the need arises. My father in law laughed at me because it ""didn't work at all"", so I took a look at it. I think he was trying to create a hurricane force wind to stoke the campfire with the way he was turning it! I had to take it apart to fix it, but then I realized how it works so well. There are at least 5 gears in there which means for every time you turn the crank, the inside wheel turns 50 times (just a guesstimate). Quite easy to fix too - and I added a little wd40 just to make it easier for him :)Very little effort is required to properly use this tool. The amount of wind that comes out is enough to stoke the fire and get the embers burning red hot."
2,Noisy and gears slips,"shoddy quality. does not last and breaks in a couple of months. If it were cheaper, it makes sense because it is basically disposable."
1,lasted 10 minutes,Lasted ten minutes before the gears started to strip. Now it makes bad noises and vibrates funny. I'd hold off on this one.
2,"Good thought, poor execution",I liked the idea but this was not a great implementation. The bearings were bad already when I got it making it noisy and loud. The crank handle was too weak and not quite the right dimensions for making easy cranking. Balance wasn't great.I got a couple of good campfires out of it before people complained too much about the noise(grinding bearings).
1,Trash - Avoid,"The moment I opened the box and saw how this thing was built, I knew it wasn't going to go well - sure enough, it broke almost immediately."
2,Air Grill gears fail during first use,THE INTERNAL GEARS OF THIS PRODUCT EASILY STRIP AND YOU'VE GOT NOTHING BUT A PAPER WEIGHT.I received the Air Grill as a present and had a chance the next day to try it out. I got one fire going (it did initially work) but it started making a racket on the 2nd fire and halfway through completely failed. The friend who originally got it for me sent it back for a refund. I then bought their heavy duty one thinking the gears were stronger but this one failed on the 1st time out. Bottom line -- UNTIL THEY REPLACE THE GEAR MECHANISM WITH SOMETHING STRONGER I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. Also their customer support is non-existent (there is no phone number on their site) and they don't answer emails. I have sent two emails asking for some resolution and have not received any response.
1,Piece o' Junk,"Don't waste your money on this junk. It will be torn up after 10 uses. I bought one, but didn't realize how flimsy and cheap it would actually be. You'll do better rolling up a few sheets of newspaper and fanning the flames."
5,It Works great.,"I purchased this over as year ago and used it many times. I originally got it because i thought it would get a laugh and it did. It feels a little cheap and flimsy to me every time i pick it up. Maybe that is why it has lasted, because i dont try to turn it in to a blacksmith bellows. It works great for starting fires and keeping the smoke out of your eyes. When camping on hot days people seem to use it more as a portable fan."
4,Nice little addition for camping,"Much easier than using a piece of cardboard, or paper plate as I often did to fan a fire. THis little gadget easily allows you to feed a steady stream of air into the fire directly at the place you want it.The only resaon I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that it is built a little cheaply. Make sure that when you slow down or stop cranking, you let go of the crank, otherwise the gears will stip and it will make an annoying click sound, and I can see it eventually not working at all. My kids did that to one and I ordered another.It could also use an expandable tube end (maybe if the manufacturers are reading this) to allow you to stand further away from the heat you are creating, but otherwise works great."
2,VIbration problem! Avoid this product!,"Good in theory and did make my woodstove fire up in a hurry, but this this blower has problems. It worked for a while but often vibrated and was hard to crank. A growling sound happened at the same time. Curious about this, I took it apart and found out al the gears are plastic and rather loose on their shafts. Some C clips were missing which may cause the gears to wander. The handle is very wimpy and bent easily under normal cranking. I was not impressed! I tried to correct some of these problems by securing the gears and applying some lube which helped for a while, but now it's worse than ever.Others have had the same problem, so this is not an isolated issue."
5,Small and powerful,This was smaller than we thought when it arrived but it works great. Very powerful and easy to use.
1,"Very good book, but HORRIBLY edited","There are at least two mistakes on every page. These include mistakes with quotation marks, dashes, missing words and paragraph formatting. Find a different edition."
2,Very stiff and bulky,"I purchased this bag just to keep snacks, wipees, and a cup in since my daughter is potty trained. The bag is very stiff and looks lumpy when filled. It is cute and very girl which is why I bought it in the first place. It is constructed very well and seems very durable. Maybe it will loosen up after use.Update: After a few months of use the bag is still stiff and lumpy and got dirty very easily. The clip is also very stiff and hard to open to get into the bag. Would not buy this bag again."
4,Art,"This is a good overview of all periods of art from prehistory to the present. It covers many artists from the time periods the book is divided into, but the representative artwork is limited. Only the most important artists have their work shown, and even then only one or two at the most are included. The book does give a brief biography of the artists, but this information can be found in many other locations.But there is a simple charm about this book. Of course online is the best source for multiple depictions of artists' work as books are too limited. But if one needs a quick reference on artists, this book delivers useful information."
4,Good and basic,"It is a bit basic, but if basic is what you need and want, then it's done well. Good intro into reading into paintings."
4,Better than the Other Book,"There is another, newer book about extruders, but it doesn't come up to the kneecaps of this book. It contains everything you need to know about extruders. In fact, I ordered the other book also after this one and returned it because it had a lot of pictures and not as much information as this one...just had newer pictures."
3,Jeff Balloon Deflates & Frightens Toddlers,"Entertaining video with the exception of a ""Where's Jeff?"" performance where a giant Jeff balloon is inflated and deflated on stage. My 17-month-old son and neighbor's 2-year-old daughter are intensely frightened and burst into tears. We've had the video for months and my son knows when the balloon is coming, immediately getting scared and teary-eyed. I've never seen my son so sad and frightened. My recommendation is that if you wish to buy this video/DVD, consider fast-forwarding around this performance."
3,"arrived on time, but DVD was defective","The DVD arrived on time, but it was defective. the sound sync was totally off what their mouths were singing. As this is a concert DVD it absolutely renders it unwatchable for my 5 year old.but when I contacted them, they emailed back right away, were very nice, and said they would refund me immediately. so I would recommend this seller. I only rated it 3 instead of 5 because of the condition of the DVD not the service."
2,"Live concert is best enjoyed live, not on DVD","I think to truly enjoy a Wiggles concert, one must attend it live. Watching it taped -the audience cannot see the full stage and if we can, then the guys are quite small on the screen. Sometimes they do three split screens to show what's happening all over the screen. It's just not visually pleasing that way. The wiggles can do so much more in a studio. My 2 year old daughter is enjoying the DVD, but she is not getting up to sing or dance like for the Big Red Car. No more live DVD's for me, thanks."
5,U.S. loves The Wiggles,"I have never written an Amazon review, but my 2-year-old LOVES The Wiggles so much, I had to put the word out. ""Live Hot Potatoes"" is the first DVD I bought after wearing out ""Wiggle Time."" It's so refreshing because I actually WANT to get up and perform the songs with my son. The music and dancing is fabulous...these guys have tons of talent. Even my husband loves them! I recommend this along with ""Wiggle Time"" and ""Wiggle Bay"" to any parent like me who can't stomach Barney or the Teletubbies (makes my skin crawl)."
2,not the best wiggles video,This video seems like a bad bootleg. Songs are good and my daughter watches it. It was not what I expected
5,Best Wiggles dvd,Thank goodness for this dvd. I have a 21 month old granddaughter and this dvd is the only way to get her to bed at night. The two of us watch it and do a couple of the songs and dances each night. Once we are finished she is ready to go to sleep. Thank you Wiggles!
4,Not Bad For One Volume Commentary,"This edition was retitled from the Full Life New Testament Commentary. It does represent the only classical Pentecostal single volume commentary available.The commentary has many positives. For one, unlike the notes on the Life in the Spirit Study Bible, the notes found here are from various Pentecostal scholars. This helps avoid one man's views versus another. Further, the notes reflect firm convictions concerning the authority of Scripture, the inerrancy of Scripture, and a firm belief in the supernatural power of God.The only draw back to the commentary is that it lacks a good expository outline of the New Testament books and uses the NIV for its main text. I would prefer a literal translation such as the NASB or NKJV (see my review of the Life in the Spirit Study Bible)."
5,Bell Automotive 22-5-00705-8 32 psi Tire Pressure Monitoring Valve Cap,Good value. Takes the guessing out. Just look and you know that the tire pressure is ok. This product works as described and is easy to use.
1,deflate tires,"Seriously, these actually let air out of tires. do not buy them! I just took my car in for having a flat and this is what's been making them slowly leak air!"
3,Great concept,"I love the idea of these and they seem to work pretty well although they are hard to read. Mine do not have the red top/green bottom as pictured although this makes more sense...Mine have green top so I look to see if the green top has receeded any. They seem to work better than my old valve caps for some reason as I havent had to put air into my tires as often as I had to before. You still have to check with a gauge when you fill but if these little things even make me think of checking my tires more often, they are a good deal. I live on a dirt road and they are always filthy so need to wipe to check but I still like em. Good winter item."
1,The Worst Product I have ever purchased from Amazon,"This is snake oil, it does not work. I placed these on my car tires and I did not check my tire pressure with an air gauge because they were always on green. When i brought my car to BJs for tire maintenance. They told me I needed new tires and they would not honor my warranty because my tires were underinflated by as much as 12 psi. Two months later I checked the air in my tires and discovered two of my tires were underinflated by 10 psi all the time these monitors were in the green zone indicating a psi of 32."
2,Not enough info,"I am a new home owner and thought this book would be a wealth of information, but found it was lacking in some pretty basic stuff - I was installing a ceiling lamp and it mentioned nothing about grounding wires. A good concept, but it needs more meat."
5,Excellent for showing/explaining the parts in a home,The cutaway views of different things in the house and listing of the parts is absolutely fantastic. She doesn't take for granted that you know the names or anatomy. She explains very concisely and I feel so much better able to tackle projects and much less intimidated!
2,NOT FOR ME,I BUY A TON OF MYSTERIES. BUT THIS BOOK WAS FUSTRATING. ANY PET OWNER WOULD NOT TOLERATE A PET DESTROYING HOME OR NOT TRAINING.. MOST OF MY FRIENDS THAT READ THIS SAID THAT THEY THOUGHT THE SAME.. WHY DID ANNIE KEEP THE DOG OR BE FORCED INTO A POSITION TO KEEP IT.. NO BACKBONE?? I NEARLY SENT THIS TO USED BOOKS HALF WAY THRU.. I AM GLAD I DIDNT PAY FULL PRICE AND WOULDNT BUY THIS SERIES FOR MYSELF...THE MAIN CHARACTER ISNT A STRONG WOMAN LETS EVERYONE PUSH HER AROUND AND DOESNT STAND UP FOR HERSELF..
3,Susan Muto's Dark Night,"I have found this book simple and enjoyable. To the lay person it is straightforward; however, it misses some elements John of the Cross would have included as essential to the passage of life or bridging the natural to the spiritual.Passages highlighted showed a keen interest in the topic, it would have been great if the author included real activities to modern day instances which may introduce the dark night."
4,Good food for thought,"I don't think that a criticism of postmodern art should be automatically classified as right-wing propaganda, the way my fellow reviewer has done. If the reader can temper a knee-jerk defense reaction to having some sacred contemporary-art cows interrogated, this is a very interesting analysis, one I haven't fully digested yet because it's complex and well-thought out.I am an artist puzzling with how little food for the soul can be found in contemporary galleries, and how little actual insight they hide beneath the veneer of polysyllabic mental smog. Soiled mattresses and sliced-up cows leave me disappointed in way I want to understand. I found this book a good stepping stone in trying to sort out both what ""post-art"" is lacking and where to take my own art practice."
5,"Perceptive, thorough and accurate assessment of the state of art today","Mr.Kuspit has made a thorough assessment of the state of art today, its history, influences and underlying assumptions. The ""end of art"" would be a totally discouraging read if Kuspit did not also provide an overview of artists who are offering a new,aesthetically rich insight into the human condition."
2,"Good subject, bad write-up","This book has something interesting to say: that postmodern art has removed itself so far from the aesthetic, the creative, the interesting, or anything artistic, that it can no longer be considered art. Kuspit coined the term post-art for this type of creations. He has a point: whereas modernists still had integrity, and were still able to create something exciting, postmodern artists are all about discourse and cutting corners, while their art is utterly banal.Unfortunately, Kuspit found it necessary to drench his message in tons of nonsense so mind-numbingly verbose, that the message is lost. It seems that Kuspit felt the need to emulate the meaningless discourse of the postmodern artists he criticizes. I'm sure that there is some postmodern irony in all of this, but I doubt that Kuspit meant it that way."
1,post-Kuspit,"This text is torturous! Kuspit writes in circles, issuing complaints towards modern and postmodern art and denouncing artistic interest in conceptualism, anti-aesthetics, the merge of art and life, and the social system that supports art.If you want to read about the ""End of Art"" discourse I would suggest going to Hegel's ""Aesthetics"" which serves as a primary source to the topic, and then read Eva Geulen's ""The End of Art: Readings in a Rumor after Hegel""."
4,"cool calendar, OK cd this year","This is the second year I bought the Classic Blues Artwork calendar. The calendar has great artwork, primarily from the 1920s, advertising blues songs and records. Each month, there is a featured song with its artwork, and a paragraph at the bottom telling a little about the artist. Various days in each month indicate birth and death dates of blues musicians. Very cool!In addition to the calendar, itself, a cd compilation of songs from that era are included. Although it says the songs have been restored as good as possible, this year's selections still sound pretty rough. In comparison, last year's sounded excellent (I would give last year's calendar/cd 5 stars). Either the songs were in particularly shape, or not as much time was spent cleaning them up. Regardless, this is a great calendar for blues fans, as well as early 20th century art appreciation fans. Recommended."
2,Instructional,"We were so disappointed that the lyrics weren't included. As I am teaching a Spanish class, I purchased several of these without checking. Shame on me!"
2,Cheesy,"The music is pretty cheesy and the pronunciation of the Spanish is off at times. If I could go back I would un-buy it. Find something better, unless this is for really little kids who really enjoy cheesy-sounding music."
4,Nice System,This is a nice decent looking shelf system that is easy to set up and use. Accepts MP3 player. A no brainer if you a looking for a small room system that looks good and easy to use
4,Funky and furiously original,"This Terry Pratchet novel is a hilarious, coming-of-age romp through a funky and furiously original galaxy populated by 52 intelligent races and beings with endearing quirks. Some of these beings are luckier than others and our hero, Dom Savalos, is one of them. On the eve of his ascension to the chairmanship of his planet, he finds out about something that has preoccupied some of he best minds around - the science of probability maths, which predicts both likely and seemingly inevitable outcomes of individual lives. Dom find himself in the position of being predestined to find the world on which the enigmatic jokers reside - a prehistoric, highly evolved race thought by many to be responsible for most of the other intelligent life in the galaxy. But the story only starts here..."
3,OK is all,"This is not Pratchett at his best. Written many years before the Disc World Series (which are all 5 stars), it just doesn't showcase unique style in a positive light. The ending was unsatisfying. It felt like he got tired of writing the story part way through. It was all very formulaic."
4,Great stuff,"The usual Terry Pratchett laugh a minute stuff, not his best one of the Disc world series, but still a very enjoyable read"
2,Disappointed...,"As much as I appreciate Terry Prachetts books I felt as if he had ""Run out of gas"" with this particular one.I've read every one of Prachetts books and this one put me to sleep several times.I never fell in love with the characters(I did like the robot""Ways"")but mostly They lacked History and definition as far as I am concerned.Several mentions of Hogswatch and Small Gods makes you think it will follow the Genre pattern of the Disc novels but just their mention is as far as the author gets.The sum total of the facts fail to help the narrative.I felt so lost that by the end of the book I was just pissed I had wasted my time.I hope to go back and read it again to see if I missed something but as for this time...Damn!...just Damn...."
2,Dark Side of the Sun,"Book was not in the best condition.Story was convoluted. The conclusion drawn left you with a feeling of ""What?"". The characters were not well developed. The story had plenty of immagination, but lacked enough detailed to bring it together.This is the only story that I have read, that was written by Terry Pratchett, that I did not enjoy."
4,S-f but still Prattchet,"This book throws up a lot of funny and intresting ideas. I especially liked the First Syrian Bank, a Planet/Computer/ Sentient Being, who is the main character's Godfather. As in most Prattchet books there are wordplays and unexplored directions, but here we see Prattchet in a different light. This is definitley a s-f book, so some of his Fantasy readers won't want to read it.But anyone who realy enjoys Prattchet's style should feel right at home."
3,Pretty standard SF stuff,"A nice little sci fi outing, and quite enjoyable. If you aren't familiar with Terry Pratchett's Discworld books and you like sci-fi with a faint fantasy tinge (or fantasy with a sci-fi tinge), this will probably fit your needs quite nicely. It's got his endless invention and gift with words -- just don't expect the manic satire of his other work or you'll be disappointed."
2,Barely Competent,"The biggest problem of this novel is that it's about a universe instead of being about people. The lead character and his quest never become more than a reason to explore a reasonably inventive worlds that Pratchett created. The search for The Joker's World is nothing more than a Mcguffin and the ultimate reveal comes across as a Grand Finally, not a Grand Finale.Beneath the surface, you can see the emerging charm of Pratchett's writing, but mostly you're wading through disjointed and often confusing encounters with various alien races.Give it a pass,unless you're compelled to read everything Pratchett has written."
5,WOW!!!,best little stand out there for the desk top. doing home pod casting and how to video's.need a small rack HERE IT IS!!!!!!!
4,Solid for a Desktop,I purchased this to help unclutter my desk with some of my recording gear. This stand is very stable and useful! So if you want a cheap way to rack your stuff this is the way to go!
4,Sturdy Stand,"This stand suits my needs just fine. I mounted my server on it, as well as a shelf that houses my A/V receiver. Though it does have the capacity for 12U's, I don't know of anything that is shallow enough to fit in the bottom one, or even two. The angle of the stand makes me feel secure that it won't get knocked forward, but at the same time, this sacrifices this space. I don't need it anyway, so it isn't an issue for me, but it does hinder expandability a bit. I'm very happy with the functionality of this stand though, especially for the price when compared to other rackmount solutions. One other thing: I used an apoxy to force the rubber feet to stay on, as they pop off every time you move it."
3,dose the job,dos the job its supposed to do but it was kinda warped. didnt sit quite even. wasnt so bad once i put all my stuff in it. im happy with it!
2,Cheap and small,"ProsIt's cheap.It's small.ConsIt's too small: the space between units is too small. Expect things to fit perfectly or to be slightly too big.It leans backwards: this takes away space. Although this was expected from pictures, the amount was much more extreme than I thought.Be aware when planning, I ended up with 8U of usable space in a 12U rack where in needed 10U of usable space."
5,Great Home Lab Rack,I bought this to rack several Cisco switches/routers for a home lab. You can't find a better solution for the money.
4,"Nice, light, small and cheap rack mount!","I needed a cheap rack for my networking lab and this was recommended on a forum. It works, but because it's tilted the bottom slots will notaccept MOST devices that aren't short, so just keep that in mind.Other than that, it serves it's purpose!"
4,Astoundingly Engaging,"Although the fifty page intro was a bit sluggish, it fortunately did not represent the rest of the book. Flanders devotes a chapter to each room in the stereotypical Victorian house, plus one for The Street. Her research gives new meaning to the word ""depth"". She has mined non fiction, letters, fiction,and just about anything that could possibly add insight to life in that very rigid time. The result is a wealth of analysis, as well as wonderful trivia (People did not want newfangled toilets in their bathrooms because bathrooms were clean!). From the weight of women's clothing (37 pounds), to the ways households detected adulteration in their food, and the number of mail deliveries per day (10-12), The Victorian House is a treasure trove of information. The three sections of colour plates add visual evidence to Flanders' text, and the whole thing is remarkably focused trip through this world.I have no reservations about recommending this book."
4,"Great live performance and interesting, informal interview","I agree that the over-active camera work on this footage gets pretty exhausting after a while but the performance of the band here is, of course, amazing. I don't know how they themselves would rank it on their own scale but they rock solidly and brilliantly here the whole time. The interview at the end is fascinating, too, both for the band's incredible likability and charm (particularly the lovely and talented Laura) and for the informal way they treat the press and all the sad, post-Nirvana hype that they shouldn't have had to answer questions about. Sure, Nirvana was a great band but why compare them to this other great band that have always done their own thing? I wish this group the best. We could use a lot more bands like them--funny, sincere, and best of all, great."
1,Simple Database.,If you like simple stuff this Database won't disappoint you. I found it to restrictive and don't use it.
1,"Old program, office works & your own email programs are better","I'll admit that I have little patience for programs that don't do what you're looking for. Live and learn. I wanted to create databases for lists of possessions (for RL items and for RPG items). I could try to create these from scratch, but I can do better with my computer's build in data bases. D minus."
3,Not as good as the pro version,"I don't hate it -but I got the pro version and that one feels a little better than this one.Though both can be made to fit my needs, neither just fit the need right out of the box."
4,A rich variation of a popular score/ TV series,If you like the 60's tv series the it's a given you will not be dissapointed by the cd. Also there is a very very ultra cool live version of the theme. Simply magic.
2,"Something's mission, here.","I love Lalo Schifrin's music for Mission: Impossible, so I'm at a loss to explain why I find the Schifrin portion of this CD so tedious. Maybe it's because most of the tracks are variations on either the title music theme or the eight-note-mode Mission ""march."" Then again, music that works beautifully as background doesn't necessarily make for good listening apart from the action it's designed to underscore. I'm not sure. But it's great to have the opening and closing ""title"" music, though where's the revamped theme that appeared in the fifth season?The 1988 music is a waste of CD space--thumping and crashing noises, primarily. The interview with Peter Graves is interesting, and the sound quality throughout is great. Your mission is to decide whether or not these few virtures merit a purchase."
5,Thule 2 board side mount rack,"Rack installed in minutes, and I can get my boards in and out without having to lean against my car. It still leaves room for my Thule carrier on the other side for all my boots, etc. Exactly what I was hoping it would be. Wish the lock was a combo rather than a key, keys get lost to easily."
3,Red bracelet,"The bracelet was too small for me to wear, but I don't plan to return it - I will give to one of my grandchildren."
5,5th ave candy bars.,I have bought 5th ave candy bars ever sense I was a kid and I love them. The company that sent me the 5th ave candy was great to do business with but the candywas a little stale because it was almost out of date. The company made it good with the help of Amazon and I would still buy it again.
5,The best magnetic letters on the market!,"I am a Reading Recovery teacher and use these letters on a daily basis. I looked high and low and these are the best! They stay attached and will slide. The letters are a variety of colors but the vowels are all yellow. The dot is attached to the i, so you don't lose it. You won't be disappointed!"
3,A disappointment if you subscribe to Cook's Illustrated,"This is a pretty good cookbook on its own merits, but it's hard to separate Pam Anderson's effort here from her work at Cook's Illustrated magazine. As a subscriber, I am already paying quite a bit each year for her insights, so it was disappointing to see how much material here is lifted almost verbatim from the magazine. The realm of culinaria is so broad, I would think Ms. Anderson would accept the challenge of creating all-new material for this book. Sadly, that is definitely not the case and readers of this book and Cook's Illustrated will feel somewhat shorted by their investment in both products."
2,Perfect??,"The only perfect thing about the recipe for ""Memorable Meatloaf"" was how perfectly awful it was. The only thing ""memorable"" about the meatloaf is that it's the worst I've ever had. I took two bites and threw the rest away. And I was very hungry! What a waste! (The fried chicken was good, though.) Not many recipes, too much information I didn't want or need or care about."
3,A good stab at perfection but misses the mark,"This book should be geared for the beginning cook. It gives good basic instructions on cooking basic foods.After cooking several recipes, i.e. fried chicken, hamburgers, chocolate pie, homemade broths, etc. I found that my old stand by recipes were at least as good, maybe better.These recipes seemed excessively fatty. For example, using 100% ground chuck did not make for a better hamburger, it just added the extra step of draining fat. A good, flaky pie crust can be made with half the fat.The steps the author goes through to get her ""perfect"" recipes are humorous and somewhat educational. However, they are also a little complicated. Good cooking is not nearly as hard as this book makes it appear."
4,Excellent book.,"This book is great for people who enjoy cooking and enjoy thinking about cooking and food. How many times have I taken a supposed sure-fire cooking technique simply on faith and hoped for the best? Well, Anderson tries every trick and reports the results. A different kind of cook book, but sure to be a favorite for every 'foodie' out there."
4,Handy Kitchen Companion,"I have learned to cook from trial and error and I've only recently started exploring cookbooks. This book is a wonderful guide and very easy to follow. The sweets (brownies & apple pie) are exceptional and in this book is the creamiest, most delicious macaroni & cheese recipe I could find. The fried chicken wasn't up to my southern family standards, but the pancakes are heavenly. This is a great book to have for trying old American classic recipes."
2,"YADA, YADA, YADA","BLAH, BLAH, BLAH ABOUT WHAT DIDNT WORK AND THEN 2 RECIPES THAT IN HER SUBJECTIVE OPINION DID. MY SECRETE RECIPE FOR MEATLOAF INCLUDES PEPPERIDGE FARM CORNBREAD STUFFING AND HEINZ SAVOR BEEF GRAVY TO HOLD IT TOGETHER. MY HUSBAND RAVES ABOUT IT AND HE'S PICKY. DID MS. PAM TRY THAT IN HER TESTS? IT'S LIKE SAYING A WOMAN IS THE ""MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD."" FIRST, YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD AND BY THEN YOU FORGOT WHAT THE FIRST 100 LOOKED LIKE. I'D SAY IF YOU CAN'T COOK, DON'T COOK OR HAVE NEVER COOKED, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. OTHERWISE, IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY."
4,Great start for beginners,"If you are a novice cook looking to add a few American classics to your repertoire, then this is the book for you. All of the (albeit few) recipes it contains are well-tested (no surprises) and taste very good. Still, it must be noted that the recipes in this book are few in number, very basic, and many of them are variations of each other. Furthermore, almost identical versions of these recipes can be found in the much more ample Cook's Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen cookbooks- they are better buys for your money and, in my opinion, provide the same quality. But if simplicity and an easy layout appeal to you, then pick up Anderson's book."
4,A good book to have,I like this book. The explanations are great and the food turns out very good. Glad to have bought this book.Nana
5,Amazing,"Wow! Scott Bakula is amazingly talented, and I'm not just talking about his acting. I knew he could sing, but I hadn't seen all the episodes with him singing. This CD shows off the wide range of his talent, from his smooth crooning of ""Imagine"" and his own, ""Somewhere In The Night"", to the upbeat swing of Elvis' ""Blue Moon Of Kentucky"" and ""Baby, Let's Play House"" (you'd swear it was Elvis himself), the powerful medley from ""Man Of La Mancha"" to the wicked rock song, ""Fate's Wide Wheel""... not to mention Dean's little Rap ditty from Shock Theater. This soundtrack is a must have."
3,Other reviews were accurate,"Bakula has a fine voice and sounded great on the TV series. This album has too much other stuff and the versions of Bakula's songs on the CD seem more polished, less honest than when played during the episodes."
3,Does it's job: DIGITAL USERS BEWARE!,"This item works excellently with the Celestron T-adapter, and even a cheap telescope. However, there's something that all Nikon DSLR owners should know:I used this on my D200, and it was WAY tighter than I was comfortable with. Lenses/adapters are not supposed to be this tight. I was terrified, putting it on. I almost chickened out.Also, this doesn't have the stops that the lenses do - this item will spin in the camera's lens bezel, until it can come out again at the next 1/6th turn.It didn't damage the camera, but it sure felt like it had the potential. Otherwise, it allowed me to take some great pictures, quickly, with little learning curve, and a cheap telescope with a 1.25"" eyepiece."
5,just great,"take pictures of the moon and jupiter with this tool , very good product . fix prefectly on my nikkon"
5,Amazing!,"My only thing i would say is if you're drinking with a glass cup and then lift off sometimes the coaster sticks from the moisture you'll get this with any glass coaster then. Just hadn't expected it and it sometimes annoys me. They are great though, my friends still laugh at them when my husband and I have people over. They came quickly and very well packaged. Would recommend them."
4,My son Loves these!,"I purchased the smaller version of these bottles for my son at a TOYS R US. My concerns were stability and something with a breastfeeding friendly nipple. Initially he was not a huge fan because the flow was hard to get right. It said ""for milk or water"" on the box but when I put milk in it he would FLIP OUT, he was not happy at all. Now that he's a little bigger he's adjusted to them and they have been his favorites for a few months. I had to order more!The shape is kind of cute and funky and I've purchased this version for him now that he's drinking more at a time. He seems to really like them a lot. If I had to pick a complaint I would say that the nipples seem to wear out faster and with breast milk they tend to get a bit funky much sooner than with other bottles."
3,so so,"The nipples are great, not too wide and not too small either. They make the shape of the nipple part flat instead of round, which my son likes. We tried tons of nipples and he was very picky. The thing I don't like about these bottles is that they leak from the bottom - you have to screw it on TIGHT to prevent leakages. When I go to wash the bottles and unscrew the bottoms I have to struggle to get them off - that's how tight I have to get them on there so they won't leak. Also, I'm not sure if it's the material since these are polypropylene or the workmanship, but the plastic is thicker at the sites where you screw on the top and the bottoms and they just don't attach right. You have to play with it a little to get them on there straight enough to twist them into place without them going on slanted. I loved the ventaires but won't use polycarbonate. Other than the minor complaints I'm staying with these since my son seems to love them."
3,Love the nipple,I'm giving this bottle 3 stars because I love the nipple but the bottle still has some flaws. I use the nipple on the playtex dropin bottles and it works great.Pros:Great nipple design (my little guy loves this nipple)Anti-ColicCute bottlesCons:Slow Flow nipple too fast for younger babies (when compared to avent or playtex)Lots of parts to cleanNo 1 oz markerTakes forever to heatLeaks if not put together properlyI'm not too sure about the valve. My little guy still has to unlatch at times and bubbles are all over the place (inside the bottle) when he unlatches.
4,BPA free and works with Avent nipples,"I didn't give five stars because they do leak occasionally (although it is difficult to tell whether it is due to user error) and the system with the provided #2 nipples provided a slow/difficult nursing experience for my three month old. I tried sucking and had a hard time getting much out as well.The good news is that Avent nipples fit with this bottle, and given the outrageous prices for replacement nipples for the Mam system, this is a godsend. The Avent #3 nipples are easily found in stores and provide the perfect draw for my baby. These bottles are not perfect, but I think that they are the best of the BPA free options. I tried and researched the other BPA free bottles on the market and the others were either too expensive or inferior products."
1,Not worth it,"I bought these thinking they would be a good alternative to my more expensive set of Born Free bottles, and Adiri bottles.Nope, in fact they suck. The venting system is a total joke. It doesnt work, not if the vent is wet, or dry; if the vent is screwed on loose (dont it will leak EVERYWHERE) or tight. The nipple is very oddly shaped, and pressure buildup inside the bottle is ridiculous.I guess you pay for quality.The only thing good about them is that they are BPA free, but, there are plenty of better BPA-free alternatives out there.Take it from me, they suck."
2,not that great,"We tried this bottle for my son, he didn't like it much. It was hard for him to latch onto the strangley shaped nipple, and the venting didn't seem to do anything. Also the bottle was leaking, and it was impossible for him to drink the last 1.5oz. I'll stick with our glass evenflo bottles for now."
3,Leaky tops,"The first time I used these we soaked the place with the leaky top. They dont leak as long as you take great care putting the tops on. Anytime I used them I tested them above the sink first. I dont use them any more, too much hassle for night time feeds when you are half asleep. Wouldnt recommend them."
1,Don't waste your money,"All the Littermaid products I have owned are cheaply made & break easily. This is no exception. I decided to give them another try- the item looked improved from the original big square version of their litter cover. The plastic is cheap and breaks easily. The material is flimsy. My cat peed on it and I washed it, but didn't dry it- it shrunk!!! and wouldn't fit in the frame anymore- I had to throw the whole thing out after MUCH MUCH frustration trying to get the thing back together. Definitely don't waste your money on ANY Littermaid products."
3,it serves it's purpose,"It's basically a vinyl cover with plastic rods to support it. The littermaid just fits inside. Kinda nice that it fits inside it, because my cat likes to kick the litter around, and at least this contains it rather than before having little bits of litter spraying all over the place.My cat loves it, and it's keeps his litter area clean too.Only thing, i wish the little ramp to the litterbox was longer and easier to clean. What I end up doing is placing an even larger mat underneath it to collect excess litter that my cat kicks out."
3,It's not about privacy,"The reason it's NOT about privacy is -if your cat (like ours) decides to leave the Litter Maid by going from the middle of the box off the side of the box, litter gets onto the floor...this thing keeps the cat headed in the right direction to avoid excess mess. Assuming of course, that you've placed the carpet or mat in front of/under the box exit ramp..."
2,not reccomended,"I got the kabana to control litter and odor, which it did do somewhat. However, in order to add litter or scoop the smaller bits of cat stuff, you have to pull the box out. The zipper only works from one side and should be a two way. very difficult to get the box in and out of the kabana for cleaning, negating any positives about the product. The plastic frame is flimsy and easily broke on one of the attempts to get to the box to add litter. also, my cats are big and did not seem to like climbing into it."
2,More trouble than it's worth,"I purchased the cabana to keep dogs out of the litterbox. It is designed so that once assembled you slide the unit in. You have to remove the cabana to empty the litter holder and when you do the pegs fall out and whole things falls apart and has to be reassembled. If you unzip the bottom and use just the top, the structure is not sturdy enough to stand straight and I had to use a bungee cord to hold it square in the front. I don't recomment this unit."
1,"Cheap, Falls apart, Must take apart to clean litter box","The tent completely surrounds the litter box, including going underneath it. You have to unzip the top from the bottom every time you clean the litter box. When you do, the cheap plastic frame falls apart at the connectors. Save your money, this isn't worth it."
2,jim,"My cat is afraid of it I've had it for over a month now. I tried removing her old one and she started to re leave herself in the bathroom rug,since them I've had both the new litter box and old and she still does not use it!!!! not very satisfied"
1,Incomplete: can't evaluate,"HiI was first shipped litter containers, and not the indicated item.The shipper then sent the Cabana, but, it was missing 6 keys. These keys allow youto connect the different tubes to construct the tent. Without the connector keys,the items included, the tent and tubes, are useless. Since some of the keys connect 3 tubes, oneat right angle to the other two, there is little you can do to replace the missing items.I can't be of much help, since I never got the item up and working."
2,Cheap and hard to use,I bought this because I have a minor problem of a dog who seems to like the cat food after it has been processed. I put this together and it was cheap and flimsy and would in not way keep my dog from tearing it apart. So I used it and put it on a shelf so It was out of my dogs reach. With that problem solved I thought I would be OK but then I discovered how hard it is to get the unit in and out of this for cleaning let alone just trying to empty it(my unit fit all the way in unlike some of the other reviewers). needless to say it found it's way into my trash can.
1,Horrible quality,When I put it together the fabric was way to small and ripped to pieces. Could not access power button or plug with it on.
1,Terrible Construction,"We purchased a second Kitty Kabana because the first one rotted in less than a year. With no alternative to cover the Littermaid box, we purchased a second one. It arrived with the channels stitched incorrectly not allowing the plastic pipe to thread thru the channel. We returned it for another one. This one has bad stitching at the zipper and is already coming apart. The material is very filmsy, and clearly will not last. We tried the square tent that is marketed for this Littermaid box, but the plastic rods collapsed in the heat. I think someone must have purchased this company because the quality of the products have become so bad, they are really not a viable option anymore. We have already purchased a different system entirely in anticipation that this one will be unusable in less than 3 months. Don't waste your money."
