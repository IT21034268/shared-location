1,Spielberg is a hack (reason #3),Family tripe at its worst! So overrated and a complete bore. E.T. phone home! E.T. friend! E.T. want Reese's Pieces! E.T. a Christ-like figure persecuted for being different! E.T. hurt cut finger. That about sums up the whole overblown experience.
2,Child-Like View of Dangerous Aliens,"This childish view of alien relations not only denounces science as the faith of mankind, but it makes the alien creature a martyr symbol, impervious to the inklings of failure that most men have to endure. Almost as bad as the NBC sit-com drama ""ALF"", which attempted to make fun of a furry stuffed rodent from some other planet. If you find this repulsive, then may I suggest that the alien was probably carrying some type of disease with him and the director makes it seem like its a great thing to have a dirty creature from the Planet zero in your house. All around boredom and yawn sequences are found throughout. Only see this for the special effects which are worn and outdated."
5,Just wanted to have my own copy,I have enjoyed this film many time through the years and just wanted to have my own copy to ply whenever I want to see it again.
2,2 or the 4 versions don't work,To redeem the Ultraviolet and Digital Copy you have to create an account with universaldigitalcopy.com. The problem is the site does not work so you can not redeem your digital content and there it no support that I have been able to receive from universal as of yet. So if you don't mind getting only half of the product being advertised go ahead and purchase this other wise I suggest simply getting the basic blu-ray or dvd version.
3,ET The Extra Terrestrial,This movie is a classic but this version has some newly added footage that was included without warning. I still love ET but this one is not the original and I wish I would have known that.
5,finally!!,"i was very disapointed when i know that this classic movies started to follow STARWARS' foot step and re-releasing the special edition with new digital scenes.and i was going to ignore this re-release of this DVD and stick with my older version i have on VHS. it is nonsense to change thing that is already great!but the ""1982 version"" that is included in this DVD is what change everything. this is a definite must have for a fan of this movie. Finally, someone at universal did the right thing!"
4,Classic show,Kind of irritating that they edited out all the guns that the cops were holding and put radios in their hands. Stupid to change a classic into a politically correct film. But the kids still love the show and it does still have its sense of magic.
3,A great movie but too bad about dvd release,"ET was that film that moved many of us. I was and still am a fan. I was looking forward to the DVD release when I found out that the movie had been recut for DVD. Spielberg has cut the single disk set so that the film is sensitive to today, not that there was anything wrong with it. One can see the original version on televison all the time. The only place that one can get the original is in this box set. The low rating is do to that fact that the original version is not readily available to the public. I have no trouble with extended edits or directors' cuts but Hollywood should be reminded that people fall in love with films. Give us what we want and remember. Don't get me started on G. Lucas."
3,Oh Boo-Hoo...,"If you can't wait for a widescreen/special edition version, than stop complaining when you end up with a full screen version. Production companies may very well be trying to get more money off of people buy releasing different versions. But all you need to do is WAIT for the version you really want. It's not like whining will change the mind of a corporate exec."
4,E.T. Phone home,"E.T., an alien, gets stuck on Earth and wants to go back home. He is aided by Elliot and his family. GREAT FAMILY FLICK! The DVD has extra scences in it as well as new shots."
4,"E.T.P. (T.P.-too many tears, had to wipe eyes 200X)","Where do I even start? E.T. is probably the best movie to have ever been created. The night I saw E.T., my perspective on life was changed forever. Before the 'T' Man (That's what I like to call my bud E.T.) I used to collect barbie dolls and watch moths mate in my windowsills. (Of course that isn't a very good way for a 47 year old man like myself to pick up women. Nights would pass, I would ponder the meaning of life as I lined up my barbies for a tea party. I was always devastated when Ken showed up, I got so jealous. He always stole Barbie from me. One night I set his corvette on fire to get even.Anyway, back to 'T'. He has inspired me so. During the lowest times in my life when I about hit rock bottom, T lifted me up.T overcame his struggles as a young street tough from the projects. He used to sell lemonade by the spoonful to the chimney sweepers. If that is not enough to inspire you, there must be something wrong. Buy ET."
5,One of Spielberg's best films,"The first time I saw Steven Spielberg's great film ""E.T."" was in 1983 in a cinema in my home town. I was six years old. I was totally captivated by it. This is not surprising since youngsters of that age are quite easily captivated. But today, 16 years later, my opinion on ""E.T."" did not change. It is impossible to resist the charm and the ingeniuity of the film. The creature is utterly convincing and a triumph of imagination. The term ""movie magic"" was never more jusified than here. Perhaps ""E.T."" is even the film this term was invented for. I'm really looking forward to the re-release in 2002. Until then, watch it on the biggest TV set you can get (and the best sound system to enjoy John Williams' superior score). I do not need to mention that it is absolutely necessary to rent (better buy) a widescreen edition to see it in its original 1:1,85 ratio."
1,Censorship?,"I am not pro gun or anything, but altering the movie so that the crooks have walkie talkies instead of guns is just stupid. Why do Lucas and Spielberg insist on editing the classics. I wouldn't take this DVD if you gave it to me."
5,The 1982 E.T. Is Still Better,I bought this gift set last summer and was well worth the money. The thing that is nice about this gift set is that you are able to view the 1982 and the 2002 movie. Even with out the new footage and remasted sound track the 1982 movie is still the better of the two movies.
4,FINALLY THE END,I MUST SAY THAT BY TIME I GOT TO THIS BOOK. I WAS SO SICK OF READING ABOUT THIS FAMILY. DARIUS IS WHO I WAS SICK OF. I DIDNT LIKE THAT MARY B MORRISON DIDNT GIVE HIS CHARACTER SOME GROWTH. I KNOW HE WAS YOUNG. BUT MAN CAN A GUY BE A IDIOT FOR THIS LONG? YEA I KNOW THEY CAN BUT STILL. OTHER WISE I ENJOYED THE 5 BOOK SERIES OF THIS FAMILY. BUT I MUST BE HONEST IM GLAD ITS OVER. TO MUCH DRAMA. BUT STILL WORTH THE READ.
5,U GO MARY!!!,"I love all the books of this series! I kept telling my friends to read these books...well they have finally caught on..thankgoodness! Mary B. Morrison is one of my favorite authors. Her books have it all...never a dull moment. In this book everyone was off the chain...Jada, Darius, Ashlee, Fancy, Simone, Melanie, Darryl Sr., and even Wellington, with his trifling self. LOL.. I hope Mary keeps this series going. I am sure she wants to move on to even more drama..but we love these characters! Mary U Go Girl!"
4,Not a Bad Way to End it All,"I have read all of Mary B. Morrison's books in this series and have throughly enjoyed them all. Even though this was a good book, I must say I was a little disappointed. It was obvious from the onset that Morrison was working to wrap all the loose ends and bring this story to a close. As a result, there was just WAY too much going on. I felt like this was more of a script for a soap opera than a novel. That said, I still enjoyed the book and don't want to discourage anyone from reading.I was pleased with the way life ended for Darius and Fancy. I can't say that I feel the same for Jada and Darryl.Peace"
4,The Wellington Crew,"I have read the entire series of the Wellington + crew, and i thought the final book was okay, i think each of the other books were better......I'm looking forward to the next series of books. I know one thing....I would have hurt Ashlee......a slap would not have been enough."
2,too many open stories,"After all of this time waiting for this ending, it seems like she rushed it all together. Not pleased, she made Jade look weak, Darius like a punk, and Fancy a woman not in control. Boo........"
2,SO UNREALISTIC!,"I do not understand why the further this series goes the more unreal the characters are. I mean first off Ashlee leaves the baby in the car over night and didn't immediately go to jail...Whatever! Also there is the HIV status story-line with Darrius...I mean the guy is a multi millionaire and cannot get a HIV test and the results in 24 hrs? This book seemed to be rushed and not a lot of attention was paid to detail. Oh and let's not forget the 50 plus year old woman with a three year old! Fancy's character and the HOT sex were the only things that gave this book the two stars which should really be one and a half. I reccomend borrowing this book from a friend (like I did), or getting it from your local library. It is not worth your hard earned dollars."
4,Just what i expected from Mary,"I really enjoyed this book as the conclusion of the Darius/Jada/Wellington/Darryl/Fancy/etc. series. I read the 3 - book package with ""Darius Jones"" then went back to fill myself in on how things got to where they were in that book (which is how this book became my conclusion). I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
1,NEVER GOT THE BOOK,IT WAS ALWAYS A PROBLEM WHEN I WANTED THIS BOOK SO I HAVE NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THE BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS A PROBLEM EVERY TIME I ORDER IT I NEVER GOT IT
3,I want more!,I'm still missing pieces in this series. Why didn't she get more into Wellington's death? I mean he was there from the beginning of the series. At least they could have had a funeral scene or something to say goodbye. Then the part about Darius finding out about his kid. That could have been better too. But what I did like was how Mary turned sweet little Ashlee into a mad woman. Fancy turned into a better person and I think in the end so did Darius. I think they found true love. What was the purpose of that Melanie chick being in the story and even Savoy and Tyrone? I guess that was just thrown in there because they hadn't really been visited since a couple books ago. But I still wanted more details. To much skipping around was done.
5,True Advertisement,"This book was just in the condition advertised, if anything they cut themselves, because it looked new of the press"
2,Not for my hair,"I dont like it all, it does nothing for my hair but make it frizzy. I still on the hunt for a good round brush. any suggestions?"
4,Did the job.,"My hair dried pretty fast, but I can't say that it's because of the claims made about the brush, I think I just have a good blowdryer. All-in-all, it was convenient to use and did the job. It's also a good size for shoulder-length hair. It didn't get tangled in my hair and made drying my hair go by quicker due to the ease of manuevering the brush."
3,I guess it's worth the $8,"The bristles are very coarse, so they do grab your hair, but they are much too rough for my taste. Also, beware of some major staticSeems like it might be well suited for curly or wavy hair.Overall it does work, and it was worth $8, but i'm definitely not as impressed as i had hoped to be."
3,Not as good as hoped on THICK hair,"Thought this brush was a little light for my crazy thick hair. For those without that problem, the handle is comfortable and well designed with nicely placed rubber grips."
5,I love this brush!,"I bought this brush because I wanted to create volume in my poker-straight hair. I use it with a volumizing spray from Rusk and my hair dryer and I have been THRILLED with the results! It definitely takes more time to do my hair this way, but when I'm done my hair is smooth, shiny, and has great shape and volume."
4,Not for the faint of heart!,"If you like mild cheddar or monteray jack and abhor sharp cheeses, this is not the cheese for you. Kashkaval has a strong, sharp, biting flavor that takes some getting used to. It is, however, a wonderful cheese to put in sandwiches (I just had a chicken-kashkaval-hummus sandwich which was wonderful!) as it'll provide some bite to otherwise fairly bland sandwiches. It is also wonderful just with some Arabic (or pita) bread.All in all, this is one of my favorite cheeses and its flavor is quite unique."
4,Good original kashkaval cheese,"This cheese is good, I have it in my fridge now. It's a little sharp for kashkaval as I prefer the cow kashkaval cheese."
4,Not large enough for some 76-key boards,"I bought this for my Roland Fantom X7, a 76-key keyboard which is just shy of 50"" long. It did stretch to fit with some difficulty but it was so tight over the pitch bend lever that I thought it would put a hole in it of there was any extra stretch. I ended up switching to anOn Stage Keyboard Dust Cover for 88 Key Keyboards. It works quite well, The Gator GCK1540 does fit well for several of the 61-key boards that I own."
4,Keyboard Cover for Yamaha Motif,Very useful and no expensive cover for Yahama Motif ES6 and Yamaha Motif XF7. It fit exact in each keyboard.
5,Great for keeping the dust away,"This cover fits my VirusKeyboardand Korg Z1 perfectly. Even with a netbook and a desktopEvolversitting on the Virus, the cover fits comfortably. When your keyboard is in use, the cover easily packs down into a tiny bundle (no stuff-sack included, but a big zip-lock bag would probably do if necessary). I'd like to see a smaller size for use with drum machines and other table-top boxes.Note that this doesn't fit larger 76-key keyboards like the Yamaha EX5 without extreme stretching. Although another reviewer said that it works well with the 76-key Motif, I'm a little skeptical."
5,The favorite book of my childhood,"I loved this book as a child and still have it today. It inspired my love of the collie breed, which took me 30 years to fulfill my dream of having one. Now I have two!"
3,"Pleasant and inoffensive, but uninspired.","I don't dislike this scent by any means - it's perfectly nice. A clean, fresh scent that is particularly well-suited for the summer months. The citrus notes are heavy and dominant. I can't imagine many would find this scent overpowering or offensive (which is nice is a day-to-day wear scent), but for me it's too generic a smell. Since I don't wear it on my body often, I sometimes spray it to freshen up a room and I personally find it better for that than to wear as a cologne. Keeping in mind that scents are hugely personal, for me L'Eau Par Kenzo Men is simply too conservative for my tastes. Furthermore, it simply doesn't last long on me at all. I find the scent to be very fleeting, which perhaps is not surprising given that it's less expensive than many other colognes. I find it to be a pleasant smell but unremarkable and perhaps worse, unmemorable. It's not a bottle I'd personally own again, but I think for the right person this could be a nice scent."
4,fresh and unique scent,found this fragrance a few years ago and have yet to meet anyone else that owns it or has used it around me... makes a unique statement and goes well with casual or formal occasions. heating up while dancing or other things brings out all the elements that makes this my go-to EDT.
1,Disgustingly Heavy-Handed Humor,"This film is so silly & foolish that I found it embarrassing. I couldn't stand to watch the nonsense the main character was engaged in past 35 minutes & had to turn it off. I understand that everything was being exaggerated probably on purpose to make the point of how things can seem to turn out in llife, but I did not find it at all humorous.This is not ususal for me in regard to British comedies as I usually enjoy them - but this time. I was utterly disgusted by this film."
4,School for Comedy,"Directed by Robert Hamer. With (a very young and handsome) Ian Carmichael, (a terribly nasty - and funny) Terry-Thomas, and (a manic) Alastair Sim. I've seen this movie so many times... from the time I was a child and didn't understand it all until now and understand it all too well... I've loved it every time. No -- no laugh 'til you cry. No embarrass your fellow human sight jokes. No punching and violence like the Three Stooges. No Obscenities. No Chases. No Belittling. Just humor. Soft, enjoyable fun. A story about an underdog who wins by winning. Yes, a happy ending! And (I'm sorry) it may even make you think (or maybe give you a few pointers on Lifemanship)!"
5,Great Brit comedy,The original School for scoundrels is well played by all in the cast especially Terry-Thomas. A must for any Brit comedy collection.
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this product for my father-in-law and he was really disappointed in the quality of the video. He reported that it had ""flicker of some type on the visual part of the video. I would have thought someone would have viewed it content before selling this product. We would like someone to view this & then repair or replace.thank you"
5,Excellent road trip music.,I have always loved Michael Bolton's soulful music and this album is a favorite to listen to on a long road trip.
5,Good cd.,"I bought this cd because when I was 12 yrs old I bought it on cassette tape. I loved the songs as a kid. I love the song ""soul provider"", which is really the only reason I got it."
4,get off it..,"you know you used to have this album!!!Michael Bolton at his heyday. This pretty much marked the end of his AOR days (even tho we hear some with ""How Can We Be Lovers"" and ""You Wouldn't Know Love) and also the album that catapulted him into the league of AC superstardom. At this point, Bolton was fresh and actually still somewhat cool. The album scored five top 40 hits for him, including his first #1 single, ""How Am I Supposed To Live Without You"" which was also a huge hit for the late Laura Branigan a few years earlier, but Bolton was the songwriter. We also got a hard rocking side of Michael with the top 5 ""How Can We Be Lovers"", which actually scored MTV airplay, and MTV usually shunned Bolton's videos.This album and ""The Hunger"" are the only Michael Bolton cd's you need in your collection, after this album, it was all downhill as Bolton became the AC artist nobody could stand."
2,Kind of dull on half of the songs,"This album doesn't really hold up quite well, even if Soul Provider and How Am I Supposed to Live Without You are on it. The rest of the album has too many dull power ballads that didn't grab me. But keep in mind, this was summer 1989 when a series of adult contemporary ballads by Bolton, Richard Marx, and Grayson Hugh were hits. I still think that he got better with ""Time Love and Tenderness"" and ""The One Thing"" (his best album). Otherwise, I don't know how you're going to go through this drivel of mostly bland songs. A few of them put me to sleep. Bolton just lacks passion on most of these songs to me."
1,Bolton's beginning of being Michael Bolton! Horrible!,"First off I like Bolton's early work in the late 70's to mid 80's.Bolton's first albums Blackjack 1979, Worlds Apart 1980, Michael Bolton 1983, and Everybody's Crazy 1985 were all pretty good melodic rockers, but this is the end.Soul provider is the beginning of a soul failure.The only good songs on here are How can we be Lovers and You wouldn't know Love.These songs have a catchy chorus and rock somewhat.The rest of the album is garbage.Why did you sell out Bolton? It's such a shame what could of been.If Bolton stayed on the melodic metal/rock path he would be a rocker still to this day and most likely a dam good one like he was in the early to mid 80's.It's a cryin shame!"
4,EXCELLENT LATE 80'S ALBUM,"The best song on this album is ""From now on"" with guest vocalist Suzi Benson. This is the song that keeps the tape in my stereo.Synthetic string sections accompany Michael's voice very well and I agree with the other reviewers: Michael is easy listening....he's very easy to listen to....A+"
4,"Great, mindless violence","Sometimes a movie sticks in my mind because of one particular scene, and in this case, it's when Travolta's character whacks his loud, angry financier in the windpipe with a metal baton to shut his nonstop, screaming piehole for good. Great scene, very satisfying."
3,"Travolta makes an alright movie, ""good""","John Travolta really makes this movie. Their are a lot of things good going for this movie.1. John Travolta is awesome in this movie. He plays the bad guy perfectly. I love his attitude as well as the words he speaks. He truly shined in this part.2. The action was non-stop and very well done. If you like good action movies, then you will really enjoy this movie.3. John Woo is the director, and shows why he is the premier action movie director.4. Howie Long: Who would have thought that Howie could play this role even though it was small this well. He played it so well that he recieved more acting parts in future films.But while it was good in all those parts, it lacked in these making a 3 star for me rather than a 4.1. Christian Slater proves here that he has no business playing a hero lead. He is ok here, but why do I think when I'm watching this movie that Travolta could kick his ass.But over all this is a great movie, and is worth the discounted price."
4,very entertaining,"best line in the movie was ""I don't know which is most disturbing, that we have lost a nuclear missile or the fact it happens so often we have a term for it."""
5,Great Movie,this movie is great it's action packed and has a great cast. John Travolta is great in this movie. he plays an awesome villian. Christian slater is also great in this movie. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
3,An old battle.,"Simple, ancient. It is that steel vs. Steal. Nice gun HWY 1 2915 20408 you did well for now. And as for the future it just left us behind. A good Scenario. But America no earth. I hold the keys to your future."
3,Generic.,"Well, the movie often is pretty funny. Christian Slater, John Travolta, and even Howie Long have cute bits to contribute. But this is a John Woo movie, and, man, where's the action! One little gunfight, and six or seven typical big explosions. Wow. Not anywhere near his usual standards."
3,Travolta carries this movie,"I wanted to give this movie a lower rating, but enjoyed a bit too much to give is 2 stars. The plot itself is interesting, and the special effects are OK.John Travolta carries this movie as the villian. Watching his character, you can see when he breaks off into insanity. However, unlike other actors, Travolta plays the insanity coolly, not over the top. The other actors merely fill their roles, and none of them really stand out (except for Howie Long, simply because I didn't expect to see him with a real part in a movie).The DVD is disappointing, as their aren't any real extras. The video quality is good, but could have been better. I did enjoy the DD5.1 effects.Bottom Line: Watch the movie for Travolta, but don't expect a great film."
4,Decent Action Film,"With plot holes big enough to drive a Humvee through, this film is still worth the watching.The action is good, and the characters okay.Buy this film used."
2,Not a whole lot of fun.,"Okay, I know John Woo made an action film that's meant to be typical summer entertainment, which means leave your brain at the door and watch for purely for the action scenes, but it's still a distracting movie on that level. The action scenes are occasionally stilted. Sometimes, they're good (the car chase) and sometimes downright bad (train finale, need I say more). John Woo is a brilliant director in his own right, but he disappoints here. Luckily, each of his films in American release have been getting significantly better (M:I-2 is incredibly entertaining and Face/Off has some great shootouts). Even then if you enjoy the action scenes in Broken Arrow, who can forget the cheesy lines of dialogue which are meant to be humorous but end up sounding downright painful. What about the special effects, which look cheesy half the time? There's too much wrong with this already dumb action/thriller. I really recommending avoiding it."
1,The pieces don't fit,"The quality of the films John Travolta has made in his ""comeback"" years of the '90s exceeds that of the box office champs that made him a star in the '70s. That certainly goes for the ones I've seen, including A CIVIL ACTION, GET SHORTY, PULP FICTION and MAD CITY. The one dog: BROKEN ARROW! The elements seem in place: Travolta the antagonist, Christian Slater the hero, and action director John Woo. Dunno, it didn't come together, and BROKEN ARROW bored me."
1,Great MST3K Movie.,"This film is so horrible that it is a perfect candidate to appear on Mystery Science Theater 3000. However, if you like to see poor special effects inserted into the story for no specific reason, this movie is for you."
2,John Woo at his worst.,"now, i love john woo movies, but i hate this one with a passion. john woo, who has made the most coolest and mind blowing action movies made a oh we havent seen this before movie. this movie has been made 400 times. john woo is losing his style."
2,Fair,"This movie was okay, if you're looking to waste some time. Okay action, okay plot, okay acting. Just okay. Not the best John Woo has to offer."
4,XCELLENT!!!!!,"This is the best John Woo movie ever.It is far much better than face-off believe me!Those who found this movie dissapointing well I don't know what they were looking for.Face off had too much action that's were they ruined it for me.John's portrayal of the villain is impressive.Though he's shady he's a likeable rogue and keeps the film above par.Personally one of the best action movies I saw of the last decade.Goes right up there on the top of my list together wiyh the likes of Speed,Die Hard III,True Lies etc etc"
1,One of the worst movies ever made,"This is definatly a waste of money and time. The only thing worse than the acting is the writting. Rather than make a good action movie with decent writting, John Woo tryings to impress people with numerous explosions. At least 4 helicopters explode when the would not have in reality; one is shot down with a handgun, another starts leaking fuel for no reason (which is imediatly ignited by another gun), etc. I would not recomend this to anyone, under any circumstances. This is bad, even for a John Travolta flim."
1,probably the worst film ever,"where to start, well to get the good points out of the way first, john travolta does seem to have a knowing way of acting through really really bad scripts, i guess hes had ample experience.Slater as usual is poor, at least hes not quite so much into his Jack Nicolson impression this time round, but as hero material he just doesnt cut it.The script is appaling, this must be the most cliche ridden non-movie of all time. the demads made on the audiences stupidity reach new bounds.this is the definiation of a star vehicle as there is nothing else, i would find an episode of the a-team more demanding, and certainly better fun.i cant think of a film ive hated more really."
3,Lots of action in typical John Woo fashion,"""Broken Arrow"" is the story of the hijacking of nuclear weapons by a rogue Air Force officer (John Travolta). Without giving much away, Travolta is flying a high-tech B-3 bomber on a training mission armed with live nuclear weapons when things go awry. Since this film is directed by John Woo, in typical fashion it features lots of action scenes, and they are well done. The really surprising thing about this film is Travolta: he does a very good job as the bad guy--not his usual role. The special effects in this film are startlingly realistic.The storyline moves along at a brisk pace and holds the viewer's interest. It is always pretty clear where this one is going, but the trip is entertaining and enjoyable. RJB."
3,Fun with a big container of popcorn.,"Broken Arrow is a fun, action filled, check your brain at the door movie.Comon folks, if you're looking for something intellectually stimulating you came to the wrong movie.Action, action, and more action.The direction is ok, the acting from two of Hollyweirds biggest has beens is ok.All in all, it's just a good movie to watch when there's nothing else on the 800 cable channels which is very often.Worth a rental, just don't expect Gone With The Wind."
3,Silly... but alright,"This is quite the implausible tale of a lone soldier taking down helicopters with a single bullet, nuclear bombs going off and not hurting anybody, and other things. It's a good movie if you're bored and hard-up for an escape from reality, but other than that it's not all that great in my opinion."
5,Broken Arrow,I had originally taped this from TV but liked it so much that I wanted to buy it. It is a great movie and I like both the actors in it.
5,Travolta makes a great villain,"Up until Broken Arrow I hadn't seen a single Travolta film that I had enjoyed but this break from his usual fare was fantastic. He was perfect as the villian. The pacing and special effects are great too. Over all it's a great, fun and fast paced film."
3,Good Movie - BUT NOT ANAMORPHIC,"While the film is entertaining and Travolta and Slater play off of each other like oil and water, the aspect ratio is not Anamorphic, so be warned if you have a 16X9. Hope they correct that in a future release because this one keeps Wooing me back. (sorry)"
1,"If it's broken, fix it!","What a boring and insipid action film this was! If John Woo is a brilliant action director, he wasn't brilliant here. John Travolta, in a fit of post-comeback arrogance, evidently thought that he could fart and it would tickle the audience, and a fart is just about what his performance is."
1,Steaming pile of movie.,This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen. I usualy ask people if they've seen this to judge their movie taste on. Too much cheesy action and too little plot. 70% of this movie is slow motion.
1,It put me to sleep involuntarily.,"I really, really wanted to remain awake for the final 15 minutes of this craptacular flick, but I couldn't do it. I just couldn't handle it. I guess the explosions and plot incredibilities just desensitized me to sleep. Slater tosses a can of gas on the hood of Travolta's humvee and that slows him down for, what, 15 minutes? 20 minutes? Not probable. Not remotely. About the only intriguing thing about the movie was waiting to see how Howie Long would handle his lines, but he didn't really have any. Thank God for small favors."
2,Shoot 'em up,"Plenty of action, shooting, explosions. Travolta seemed to enjoy his role as the bad guy. Otherwise the acting was mediocre."
2,SSSCAT to keep cats away,"This product works well and does scare the cats away from where you don't want them, BUT it is costly avg.$10.00 and it doesn't last long at all so I would not buy them again."
2,Way too expensive,Get the large size dust off can from Radio Shack. Works fine. Half the price. Twice the contents.The ssscat itself works dandy! Now Scat!
5,Ssscat refills,"I suppose this isn't the proper venue to discuss the actual Ssscat system itself, since this review is directed to the refills. As far as the refills go, there is not much to say other than they refill the system, and are the same cans you receive with the system itself. I have ordered these more than once, and interestingly, the most recent order was marked as official refills but the packaging was changed. They appeared to work all the same, so just an informational tidbit for prospective buyers. I liked the fact I was able to get these on Amazon because I went to several different Petcos/Petsmarts and had trouble finding them."
1,"cannot use, as discharger head malfunctioned within 2 months","Unfortunately, the discharger head (shipped before the refills were shipped) stopped working within two months. Battery changes had no effect. Very disappointed."
3,"Great when it works, but not nearly enough sprays","When this product works, it is amazing at keeping our naughty cats off of countertops, tables, etc. However, the refill is supposed to provide something like 150+ sprays, and our canisters have consistently run out after maybe 50-75 sprays. I have heard that some people use cans of compressed air from radio shack or other stores instead of these pricey refills."
3,Can't get mechanical top to seat itself,"Product arrived on time and as advertised. Have not been successful getting mechanical top, which has sensor and blows the air, to seat completely without leaking air and getting very cold. Don't know if it's an earlier version of the top or if the top itself is the problem, but wanted to let you know I've had difficulty."
3,review of audio cassette,"I had high expectations for the tape, hoping that there would be specific solutions and insights. The majority of the first side of the tape was more a lecture on sociology. When the HSP symptoms were discussed, they were like a window opening for me, and offered some helpful ideas.I would say that the book is a much better resource."
4,The Highly Sensitive Person,"This book answers the question I heard from mother, close friends, lovers through the years, ""Why are you so sensitive?"" The other comment I have heard is ""You are just too sensitive to have as a friend."" I wept the first time I read this book. There is hope for most of us who take in too much information.We aren't weird. We are extremely aware. Bravo to Dr. Aron."
1,Almost no information,"I bought this cassette hoping that I could get some information about this subject in a format I could listen to while walking. If I found it interesting enough, I could then buy a book on the subject. However, this tape has almost zero information regarding the trait or how to deal with it. It is sort of the author talking off-the-cuff about getting the book published."
5,de Bart loves this actress... great movie too!,"If I hadn't lost a thumb in the war, I'd give it TWO THUMBS UP!!!Anyway, in all honesty (especially since I need over 20 words for Amazon dot com to allow me to post a review), I would say watch it with a date. I did and she liked it quite a bit. This film has something for the manly of men and softest of women. Huge like from me!"
5,Awesome movie. A must see!!,Very original a mix of Memento/Matrix/Godard's Breathless... I love films like this. It will alter the way you see the world.
2,I'm giving it 2 but I'd like to give it 1 star,"My local bike shop recently switched from Specialized to these import tubes (presumably because they are extremely cheap). And cheap is what you might find. My front tube went two weeks riding on the flat paved roads every other day for 8 miles--that's 50 miles. Then out of the blue it popped a 1-foot rip with a loud ""BANG!"". I was on the level and close to home, fortunately. You may not be so lucky. The tire was pumped to 52 lbs. pressure at the time and there were no punctures to the tire or spoke problems. Just buy Specialized tubes, or a reputable brand and you will have normal success with them. I won't be buying these again, and I'm worried that my rear tube is still a Sunlite brand. I suppose it is possible that the front tube was a lemon, but I've never had a tube rip on the seam like that before. I'll be taking the shreaded tube back to the bike shop and warning them about it, too."
3,ok,This movie was ok. I mean it was not the gratest movie but it was not boring. Some parts of this movie did get a little boring but most of it was pretty good. I recomend this for people who like dramas and comedy even thow there was very little comedy. If you like this movie you should also check out Scarlet O hare And other classics.
5,My Life So Far,"I enjoyed the film very much. I found it amusing & delightful about an inquisitive, precocious youngster. A few of us found out about life this way. Some parents had a difficult time explaining our questions. Some may have done what gorgeous Colin Firth, the father did if they had the opportunity. I will definitely watch it again."
4,Times gone by,"My Life So Far is the memoir of an engaging 10 year old, charmingly acted by Robert Norman. His traditional Scottish family, portrayed just after The Great War, lives the cultured life of the British upper class, but times are changing. Fraser and his eccentric inventor father (Colin Firth) both fall for the lovely French fiance of an older, wealthier family scion, and the competition begins. Feeling belittled by his dad, Fraser vows to exact revenge by educating himself in the ways of the world by reading forbidden books. His strategy works, but there are several comical moments that develop because he does not quite understand what he is reading. The movie reaches a crisis when the family matriarch dies, and the denouement brings major changes. The actors are all well suited to their roles, the scenery is idyllic, and My Life is a charming, gentle story of times gone by."
1,No captioning or subtitles,This DVD has no closed captioning or subtitles for the hearing imparied. This renders it largely useless to me. The Amazon product descriptions should explictly state when DVDs have no capitioning or subtitltes.
2,"Decent, but nothing special. 2.5 stars.","CF: ... It's um, it's, er, about an eccentric family in the thirties, the father of which owns a moss factory.BJ: Doesn't moss grow naturally?CF: Well, no, he makes something called sphragnum moss, which was used to dress World War One wounds and, er, it's, er, quite a light, er, comic ...BJ: (Very unconvincingly) It sounds very good.CF: I very much hope it shall be.BJ: Could I just check something about the shirt?Sorry to quote, but this basically sums up the movie and my opinion of it. A light comedy with an unpromising plot that delivers an original, but slightly boring story about a family and a new woman that comes into their lives. Some of the scenes are quite funny, such as the sex talk scene, but nothing really stood out in this movie as all that great. I liked it, but I had a hard time paying attention the whole way through. And, to be honest, after I finished watching it I put on Pride & Prejudice and fell asleep."
4,Delightful film that did not get a large audience,"This is a delightful true story of a boy who grew up with a somewhat eccentric father, an inventor, in a large estate in post-World War I Scotland; the boy, age 10, later became an important figure in British TV. The film was made some years back before Colin Firth, its star, won an academy award for The King's Speech. The film is delightful to watch and audiences who saw it enjoyed it, but the film never made it because, according to its director Hugh Hudson, Miramax who owned the film did not push it. He claims that Miramax did not want it to succeed because they were pushing another of their films, one that won an academy award."
5,artist on the book,"This book reflects the life and work of a major independent figure. The work spans the second half of the 20th century and shows an alternate answer to the dilemma of post second war Art. Not abstract while dealing with the heavy burden of the great Holocaust and the use of the Atomic bomb. That history had changed forever what violence could become. The artist answered with a figurative art rather than chaotic forms yet his images are provacative and disturbing. The formal means are convincing, even beguiling. The text by Mario de Michele a model for writers on Art as it is not jargon or intellectual ballet but filled with exciting and revelatory ideas of a liberal thinker."
3,Lack of balance,"At the risk of repeating myself and getting up all the romantic Polish nationalist fanatics against me, I must say that all these reviews are pollyanaish. Only John Connelly in the London Review of Books has given Davies the judgment he deserves: praise for unearthing the courageous resistance of the Warsaw fighters while observing how irrational, how foolish, and how questionable their motives were."
1,One word: Awful!,"It seems to me that most reviews are positive - usually written by readers who enjoyed the book. Therefore I'm not suprised that ""Uprising"" has four stars.However, this book was truly bad. I was hoping to read a detailed history of a little-known event. Instead this book is a overly lenghty diatribe about valiant Poles being betrayed by, well, everyone else. Davies loses all pretense at objectivity, and in an amazingly juvenile fashion persistenly substitutes the phrase ""the first Ally"" for the word ""Polish;"" as in ""the First Ally's tanks ...""Anyone hoping to actually learn much about the Warsaw uprising will be very disappointed."
1,Go home Norman Davies or my money back,"If you think you are buying a book about the Warsaw Uprising, forget it. The actual Uprising got scant treatment in the book, and all you get is Professor Davies' pedantic showoff of his tenuous and slippery grasp of Polish history.And Polish brutalities, pogroms, massacres, ethnic cleansings and atrocities, before, during and after the war against its minorities, Germans, Jews, Ukrainians, Gypsies, were all but omitted.Is that what you call history, [...]"
3,Anglo arrogance in name altering,"Norman Davies' detailed and well-researched account of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 against the Nazis is a major contribution to World War II history. The heroism of the Rising is much underappreciated, as is the malice of the Soviets and inaction of the Americans and British in relation to supporting it. Davies helps to set the record straight. However, this otherwise fine book is marred by Davies' odd decision to alter Polish personal and place names, supposedly to make them more acceptable to English readers. Even famous Poles (eg. Premier Mikolaczyk, composer Witold Lutoslawski) are not immune to having their names altered at Davies' whim. I found myself repeately slowed down in my reading by having to look up the real names of major players in the history. In all, it comes across as an appalling piece of Anglo arrogance that detracts from an othewise strong work."
3,A history for non-historians,"Without belaboring points that have been made before or trying to sound pretentious about the subject matter of the book I would only recommend this book for people who want to get an idea of what happened in Warsaw in '44. I would not recommend this book for anyone who wants to use it for further exploration into the subject. As mentioned in many posts the main reason for this is the horrible decision to ""modify"" the names of nearly everyone involved in the Rising. I found myself constantly referring to the appendix to discover who I was reading about. Another reason to avoid this book if you are interested in anything other than a onetime read is the indexing. As a reference book the high number of omissions in both the list of names and the general index makes it nearly useless. While this book will remain on my shelf I doubt it will come down again."
4,A light orange flavor,"This coffee has a smooth, rich, full-bodied taste with a hint of orange. It tastes very good, but I was a little disappointed because the flavor is Outrageous Orange and I expected a more intense orange flavor. However, I would buy it again."
4,Real Men Know Yoga Rules,"Former Pro-Wrestler DDP has show many talent over the course of his career (His role acting in WCWReady to Rumbleis outstanding). In this book DDP shares the knowledge and growth he's obtained through his Yoga practice after his Pro-Wrestling career can to a close. The book explains why men need to get over their fears of seeming un-manly and grab a yoga mat. The book features photographs of him and friends breaking down the workings of each pose and offers then offers many routines for the user to undertake on their way to Yoga bliss. The book is as goofy as one will find in the yoga world, but it's nice to read about Yoga from someone who has a wealth of life experience (like getting power bombed though three cages). Yoga is the best form of health-care in the world and this book give you the keys to a long healthy life."
2,Price is right - - Fit is wrong,"After reading the earlier reviews, I ordered this anyway hoping it would fit my new etrex Vista. I should have thought twice as the holes in the Glove don't give you access to all of the buttons. The Vista has the 'Click Stick' in the front that does not have a cutout in the Body Glove and I'm afraid to make one. The power hole is too small and I can't turn the Vista on or off without an object to reach in the hole.Sorry Amazon - This baby is coming back your way"
3,Case button holes problem,"I found the Body Glove case very form fitting and nice looking, however I found the holes for the Etrex buttons to be too deep to comfortably use the buttons. I did return the item for this reason."
1,It's okay at best,"I can echo the problem with the buttons not fitting...I had to cut out the padding on the inside to get it to fit. After that, it's still hard to use with the case on: basic navigation is okay, but when you do lots of button presses you need to take it out of the case. I hear it causes a GPS to float, which could potentially be a good thing (knowing my clumsiness) and it does do a good job of protecting your GPS. Perhaps the Garmin brand case is better."
1,America Does It All Wrong Again....,"What can I say? I rented this dvd with the greatest hopes. After about half an hour I realized I was in for yet another plotless, uninspired, repressed look at teen sexuality. Politically it's a complete horror - of course the girls must all suffer for their sins. Symbolically it rises to the level of bad junior high school poetry - barely. Yes the performances all all very good. And its great to see Jackie Burroughs in anything. But for a REAL treatment of similar topics get NICO AND DANI or SHOW ME LOVE. Both show that on this subject, like most (other than mindless violence or overpriced special effects) European filmmakers are still light years ahead of us sophomoric Americans...."
2,True love . . .,"True love does not seek to manipulate, exploit or possess the will of the other -- no matter the context, no matter the circumstances, true love will RESPECT the will of the other and grant their freedom. The essential condition for love is respect for the inherent freedom of the other.Keep this in mind as you watch Paulie's psychological self-implosion and disintegration -- ask yourself if she is somebody to be commended, especially in the latter half of the film when she seeks by any means necessary to possess the will of her beloved.(A second viewing may be necessary to see this point)."
1,"Bad, bad movie","The movie started out promising enough, but as it progressed, story lines were dropped, or rather went no where and were left as loose ends. Also, the script became terrible! Some of the lines were laughable and very untrue to life. I would advise watching this movie on mute. That way you can enjoy the very attractive actresses without having to listen to the dialogue."
5,Very Real To Me,"This movie hits really close to home for me being that I was in the same situation a few years ago. The acting is surprisingly genuine. The moment that Tory realizes that she just betrayed the love of her life after telling her younger sister that Paulie has a thing for her and that she is not ""like that"" and she bursts into tears...it seemed very genuine. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone. It's obviously a relevant topic and source of conflict that many people can relate to. I like the movie ""Imagine Me & You"", but Piper's acting was a lot better in this film."
5,Pain of Love!,"When I watched the movie I was drawn to the intense emotions of Paulie! Piper Perabo played Paulie beautifully! I cried as I watched the pain she went through! I saw it as two people loving each other, and one pulling away because of what people thought! You forget it's about a story of two girls in love, and see that it's about what love truly is! Like Paulie said in the movie Love just is!"
2,"superb acting, but a mediocre script","When Mary (Mischa Barton) arrives at boarding school, she quickly finds out that her roommates Paulie (Piper Perabo) and Tori (Jessica Paré) have a lesbian relationship. When Tori's younger sister also finds out, Tori feels forced to end the relationship, because she thinks her parents will never understand. Paulie can't take this and goes mental.So far so good. This could actually make a very interesting movie. But unfortunately, the rest of the script kills it. The movie unfolds in dramatic clichés upon more dramatic clichés, from the passionate reciting of poetry to a duel between Paulie and Tori's new boyfriend. It all just gets too over the top dramatic, which is a shame, because the entire cast gives out a superb performance and really deserved better."
4,Quick & Professional,"I ordered the item a few days ago and received it in great condition. There were no scratches on the DVD and the cover, as was told in the description, had a slight blemish. I'm really happy with my purchase and I would buy from this seller again! :)"
3,"Could have been better,","My friend had recommended watching this movie to me a while ago, so I finally did. All in all it wasn't bad but the twist came too soon in the plot and 2/3 of the movie was lost because of it. However I did enjoy Piper Perabo's character because it was really the only main character with A personality. Mischa Barton's portrayal of Mary ""Mouse"" Bedford was good but sometimes it was a little ""wtf"" (see the narration). Teens will relate and probably get a bigger kick out of it than not. I actually did cry because most of the movie was quite sad, but there needed to be more PLOT, had there been this might have been on my all-time Top 10 list."
4,Lost and Delirious,"Lost and Delirious is a haunting and very impressive film. Mischa Barton does an excellent job as the new girl sent to live at an all girl's college. She quickly becomes close friends with her two roommates, Pauline and Tory, who are also lovers. The imagery and cinematography in this film are done brilliantly, some of the best I've ever seen. Great story outstandingly told as well. The acting is occasionally a bit overdramatic, but still quite superb. The ending is a little predictable, but I think most people (the smart ones anyway) would find this film to be quite evocative and most excellent nonetheless... And they would definitely be right :).Based on the book The Wives of Bath by Susan Swan."
5,Love Is,"""Love Is. It just is and nothing you can say can make it go away. It is the point of why we are here. It is the highest point. And when your up there looking down your there forever. Cause if you move right? U fall. U fall."" This line from the movie has been in my head since I watched it. Actually last week I went and got my first tattoo. Love Is on my ankle. This is an excellent movie for anyone who has every experience heartbreak with their lesbian lover. It makes the pain not look silly or unimportant. Like how I first felt. Why be upset over a relationship with a girl?. But the pain is real and this movie protrays that. This is an awsome movie for anyone who wants to have a good cry."
1,Amazingly bad,"I have to say, usually I find Amazon reviews to be a helpful place to find out more information about an item, and I usually find that the reviews are at least relatively on target. This movie is a shocking exception. I'm amazed at the large number of positive reviews for a movie that I nearly couldn't watch all of the way through, it was so painfully overwrought. Add together an overdose of teen angst with some overdone dark symbolism and you wind up with this film.I expected so much more. I think the film tried really hard to be artistic, deep, meaningful, and powerful. But it just tried TOO hard, and instead ended up being self-indulgent and irritating."
5,Love is being lost and delirious,"What you find here is a story about girls who only desire for out of life. A couple of girls at this school take their love to the next level, only to discover that one of them can't deal with that pleasure of coming out, nor easily ready to face those challenges with herself."
4,Moving Story,Piper Perabo and cast did an awesome job of showing how far you would go for true love. I highly recommend this artful look at lesbian love. Buy it!!!!
5,Timeless perfection,"Based on the budgets given for filming controversial stories, the director produced a world class ageless film. The acting is superbly delivered. The film captures the immature emotions of young people in love, where love makes their entire world turn round. Coping with rejection at such a young age is not always easily and if not seen or handled properly can and in the film, does lead to tragic circumstances"
4,Experiencing Piper,"Piper Perabo shows why she is a brilliant young actress with many wonderful performances ahead of her. The rest of the acting is suspect, but the love story is deep and intense. The movie, also, is a good way for anyone to observe the origins of the destructive bigoted behavior that our ""free"" society here in America is still plagued with, to this very moment."
3,Intriguing,"The story is a bit far-fetched at best, but Piper Perabo delivers a solid performance following up Coyote Ugly. She is believable as the lovesick heroine in this film, and I found myself really feeling sorry for her as I watched her unravel emotionally and physically."
5,Best movie this year,"I saw this movie just two days ago, and its still in my head. The story, acting, and direction was terrific, and told a beautifully tragic story. It captured the two girls tragic love perfectly. I have to recommend this movie. Its rare to see a movie were the story and a few characters can be the whole movie and succeed on all levels, without some big special effects or outrageous humour. A Must See Film."
3,Saved by the cast,"This film about various forms of rejection is strange even by Canadian standards. It begins to fall apart about the time the boarding-school lesbian relationship falls apart. By then the writer(s) has resorted to melodramatic use of Shakespeare to demonstrate the crazed intensity of love -- a sign that the writer had exhausted her own resources.There is a nude scene with the pretty and very-well-endowed Jessica Paré to recommend it to guys, and the school has a bucolic setting. However, the best thing about the film for me are the sightings of some amazing American and Candian actresses early in their careers. Besides Piper Perabo (American) and Jessica Paré (Canadian), the story's central character is played by a very young Mischa Barton -- already a willowy beauty. Also in the cast in a few scenes each are Canadian actresses Emily Van Camp and Caroline Dhavernas (she is especially pretty here, and is already speaking English without an accent)."
2,More of the same,"Why is it that lesbians are either homicidal maniacs or suicidal neurotics? I know that this movie was made by lesbian director, Lea Pool and I want to support her efforts. However, this movie, besides having an overdone, hackneyed plot, was full of trite and affected dialogue. Ok, so I'm a realist, sue me, but I'm sorry, no one I know would who's in high school would jump on a table in full fencing regalia and recite Shakespearean soliloquy. In the end, heterosexuality wins out and the poor lesbian, being tortured as she is, must put herself out of her misery. I can't recommend this and hope that if you must see it, by all means rent it. Been there and done better than this."
2,STU-PID!,this movie s[disappointed].gratuitous sex scenes.voiceovers--horrendous!piper perabo's acting & monotonous voice--horrible!but i still watched the whole thing so i guess it wasn't the worst movie ever made.but i could tell it came from canada.
4,"Peter Pan's Lost Boys...Lost Girls, ""Lost and Delirious,""","Therein lies the title for this movie. This is definitely a two kleenex box movie. Three girls, two in love with each other. One willing to give everything the other is choked by the hands of society, and her parents, holding firmly to her throat.This movie is well acted, well scripted, full of poignancy.Check out ""Show Me Love,"" to recover. It has much more profanitybut in another language, you can glance over the bad words, it wasn't distracting, go figure."
2,You can't be serious...,"Although this movie portrays lesbian drama in such a way to be true (From Experience) I thought this film was awful. I'm so tired of these melodramatic films where lesbians are always portrayed to be ""head cases"" or drug addicts. In my own opinion I found this movie hard to watch and actually couldn't wait until it was over. Pauline was a definite nut and if I were Tory I would've been happy to finally realize what would've happened if they had stayed together much longer. I give this movie 2 stars simply because of the great pyschotic actions of Pauline. She was really SCARY!!"
2,"Disappointed, just another teen angst flick...","When I first heard of this movie, I thought had to see it. But by the end of the movie, I found myself wishing it was over a lot sooner. The situations Piper Perabo's character continued to put herself into, i.e. the library scene, the father/daughter dance, and the duel, were long, drawn out, and highly unnecessary. Halfway through, I found myself wishing that Piper Perabo's character would just kill herself already and get it over with. Jessica Pare's character was at least believable, but it definitely wasn't necessary to make sure we knew she didn't go ""that way"" when she watched the girl and guy do it against the tree (she only got turned on watching the hetero-sex). If you want to see a believable teen angst flick see All over Me or Show Me Love, skip this one."
5,This movies too Piperlicous for ya babe,If you didn't fall in love with Piper after Coyote Ugly you surely will after this .This movie work's well on a male fantasy level of 2 gorgeous girl's and also a very Heartfelt if not a little sappy look at love .I recomend everyone to buy this awesome movie you will not be dissapointed
5,awesome,I got this for my husband's birthday. He loved it. It is a very nice size and came packaged very well. My husband loves it so much he put it above the fireplace instead of a family picture.
5,Great poster and even better customer service,"The poster visually was exactly what I expected, which is always good. It arrived crease which happened in transit as the tube itself was slightly bent. I got in touch with them, gave them the details, and they got a new one out. Awesome customer service, keep it up.Cheers,Vivek"
2,Arrived creased,"The poster arrived with a rather distracting crease spanning it lengthwise, and was lower resolution that I had expected (though the latter could be due to the original painting being a smaller size perhaps)"
4,Great,"Have this one framed in thin black frame. It hangs over my TV in the living room. Looks fantastic.I think the dimensions of the poster are slightly bigger than they state. I bought the 36 x 24"" poster frame and the picture bubbles a little because it is too big to fit ino the frame.Love the picture. Coloring is great. Wish it was real."
5,"""Close to the Pinnacle of Women's Literature""","""1106 Grand Boulevard"" by Betty Dravis is a biographical account of Billie Jean, a lovely girl married young during the Depression, and the reader travels her life with her, as she experiences early domestic violence, loss, family support, and a trail of heartbreak and broken hearts, while at the same time a hearty dose of laughter. Billie Jean isn't perfect and doesn't pretend to be, and like many of us, it takes a lifetime of experiences to figure out what she really wants in life; but that's the message; the journey is what life is all about. This is a wonderful read with almost every issue especially important to women: Marriage, children, divorce, independence, domestic disturbances, and forgiveness fully addressed leaving the reader with a smile. Five Stars!"
5,Sweet story of this nice lady's sister's life,"This was a very interesting read for me because it's based on fact and I have gotten to know Mrs Betty through the Internet (I write and illustrate for children & ive met quite a few great authors, Betty being one of those) Betty is such a sweet lady, I just had to try her book and it was a really enjoyable read especially if you enjoy romance as I do. Good luck Betty in your writing ventures :)Mandi"
4,WOODY CREATES HARRY CREATING KEN WHO COULD BE PART OF WOODY,"Intellectual pleasure is so rare today that it would be really masochistic not to enjoy DECONSTRUCTING HARRY. Woody Allen had already treated in THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO the theme of imaginary creations coming to life and, this time, these are no more movie heroes but book's characters.With a plot line like this one, Woody had to write a really solid screenplay in order not to get lost in the multiple possibilities it involves. And it works !Harry is an unusual variation of the Woody character we know. He's a hooker addict, a womanizer and he likes to drink alcooholic beverages. Around him, Judy Davis, Amy Irving and Richard Benjamin give above-average performances.The cinematography is excellent, Woody trying some interesting arty effects like an ""out of focus"" Robin Williams and chaotic editing.A DVD fo your self."
3,GOOD!,"This guy ALlen is a freak, but I must admit that this movie is something unique to watch. Allen gives the audience a movie with fast dialogues, funny (and sometimes grotesque) situations, intelligent plot and great acting. No wonder actors normally do anything in their reach to work along with Allen, sometimes even for free. The anguish and neurosis of the main character almsot leaves the screen and went into the audience's skin! Amazing!"
3,Great movie to own,"Great movie to OWN, since you will have to watch it several times to understand what's going on. I would also suggest not watching it after a long day at work. It is sometimes difficult to understand because of the frequent flashbacks and requires some concentration. Definetly do not make trips to the kitchen, or to the bathroom without pausing. The cast is unbelievable, a lot of great actors and actresses, and the movie is pretty funny. On a separate note, what a great service from amazon.com. Imagine being stuck in Tokyo like me, where the only English channel you can watch is CNN. With just a single click of your mouse you can buy great movies, and even get a privilege to write a review. HATS OFF to amazon.com"
1,Loathesome film that makes Allen look pathetic.,"The usual Woody Allen neurotic schtick, this time enhanced with insights into his heretofore unexamined racism and self- hatred. How is it that this man has made umpteen films about heterogeneous New York City, but only in this movie does he have non-white characters? And why are these characters both ""exotic"" prostitutes? Why are observant Jews treated so harshly? One gets the sence that deep down, Woody Allen is uncomfortable with anyone who isn't a WASP. His enfatuation with the shiksa and shaygats ideals gets tiresome."
1,Wow...This is a Stinker,"Usually there's at least a few laughs in a Woody Allen movie, and many of them have more than a few.But this one was just AWFUL. Ten times the neuroses and ten times the vulgarity of a typical Allen film. Overall a totally graceless, droning film experience which I regretted having. I really can't believe this movie get so many glowing reviews here. Not to mention that most of the humor is quite adolescent.A low point for Allen."
2,I really wanted to like this movie,"I am a big Woody Allen fan; Broadway Danny Rose is still one of my all time favorite movies. But I found this film mean-spirited and depressing. Mr. Allen has made several terrific movies, revolving around the basic story of the compassionate and intelligent underdog struggling to try to comprehend the human condition, and the importance of interpersonal relationships and trying to help others. He appears to have given up on relationships and people as a whole. Perhaps he has become more cynical. Perhaps more realistic. In either case, I just found it saddening. I heartily recommend Broadway Danny Rose, Annie Hall, Manhattan, Stardust Memories, Love and Death, and Sleeper for anyone looking for funny and thoughtful movies."
3,"Witty, perhaps, but heartless","There is no doubting the genius of Woody Allen. The clever ideas and witty dialogue flow thick and fast here, but there is just one problem: The film is totally and utterly heartless.Woody Allen's humour here is just downright cynical. Cruel, even. The film has a narcissistic feel to it, where everyone is mocked and ripped apart mercilessly apart from Woody's alter-ego, Harry. Though I saw this a few years ago and loved it, on rewatching it recently, I just couldn't enjoy it. His cynicism here is left untempered by optimism and faith, something that marked out his earlier work. Sorry, but this just left a bitter taste in my mouth."
2,MORE OF WOODY ALLEN ABOUT WOODY ALLEN,"It's not s bsd film with some good scenes,but I'm getting somewhat tired of his egocentric self condemnation.The scene with Kristie Allen is really something though."
5,The Best of the Worst,"Anyone who likes Woody Allen movies knows there are brilliant ones and flops. This is a brilliant one. Human nature is all too completely revealed, and the subtleties of some of the vignettes will keep you coming back again and again to figure them out. Personally I thought the saturation of four-letter words somewhat burdensome, but the fantastic script, directing, and acting make up for the discomfort. I'm buying this one for my always-small video collection."
3,Racism? Where???,"First I would like to address the movie as a whole. I am a huge Woody Allen fan so to me everything he does is art.. However, I am not above criticizing. I agree with previous reviewers.. this is not his best work.. then again this was during his 90's down period.Now, for my point of contention: Why is it racist when the fille de joie (aka, harlot) is of African American decent?Would it have been better if she were Polish, Greek, French, or South American?? I don't understand this double standard.. and frankly I'm sick and tired of the rabid sensitivity concering the ""race"" issue. There is prejudice against all ethnicities.. Blacks are not the only ones to have been persecuted in history."
5,One of the best movies from Mr. Allen,"I can't tell how much I enjoyed the movie. The cast is fantastic, with very young faces in the back (like Paul Giamatti, for instance).I was very happy to get the DVD, because it hasn't been for sale, here in Brazil.A very clever movie."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I was forced to watch this movie for college. It was the most vulgar, unnecessary piece of junk I have ever seen. This is a perfect example of the demoralization of America."
3,OK,Box cover excellent. The movie plays great but I didn't expect so many scratches. It should have been stated that it had these scratches but otherwise I am still content with my purchase.
5,Blu-ray Please!!!,"This is a hilarious film,very layed comedy.The positive reviews have said it all. I'm hoping it will come out in blu-ray sometime soon!"
2,"Bad film, good ""shticks'","There are quite a few good lines and great characters thrown at you in this film but, as a film, it doesn't hang together and is unbalanced."
4,"Unsettling at first, but ultimately enjoyable","I wasn't very receptive to this film when I first saw it. I was distracted by the foul-mouthed Allen character; made to feel uncomfortable. Which was the point I guess. The film opens with a vicious argument and a strange, repeated image that unsettles. If you were expecting something else, you have to adjust.I adjusted better the second time through and enjoyed it much more, hence this edited review. There are plenty of good jokes (like the out of focus actor, played surprisingly subtly by Robin Williams) and set pieces. The scene when Harry visits his sister is particularly funny - classic Woody Allen.On the whole, I felt the film was treading old ground perhaps a little more than usual. I don't think of it as one of my favourite Woody Allen films, but it does stand repeated viewing."
2,Wrong ISBN,"This is a discouraging product to deal with. Apparently the publisher has labeled the ""abridged"" product with the wrong ISBN (cassette tape version). I wanted an unabridged edition, but when I ordered with the number listed, I received the abridged version. What is the publisher going to do about it? Or what is Amazon going to do about it? I now have three copies of Jerusalem's heart--all abridged. I can't really give a review of the story because there is too much left out in the abridged version. I like the Thoene's writing, BUT can't comment further."
2,Be Careful,"I have a similar unit and for the most part it works OK. However, HP decided to use only a SD expansion slot. Very few accessories go into this slot. Most accessories require a larger CF slot which some of the competition offer on their units. For HP you must by a CF slot accessory + the GPS unit or camera, etc."
3,compaq Ipaq color pocket pc,... receptions is fair to be nice.PDA works well but many times hangs up on window display and will not remove window yet will allow other function to proform.Good PDA terrible reception phone especially compare to cheapest Nokia which was free had 2 times the reception.
5,Unbelievable little machine,"If you've ever wanted a ""real"" pc that will fit in your pocket, this is the closest you can get. Taking notes (with foldable keyboard attachment, purchased separately), watching movies, listening to mp3s, playing a variety of computer games, reading e-books, performing scientific calculations, graphing, surfing the web, checking e-mail -- these are just a few of the things you can do with this little wonder. Definitely money well spent."
3,An Action Packed Racing Title,"Midtown Madness,the original driving game.This game was fairly well. It provides us with all of the best stuff.It includes 10 different vehicles such as the Ford Mustang GT,Ponaz Roadster,City Bus,Semi Truck,and more.This game has set up a chicago edition for us to speed around in.Although it does not provide us with any real driving missions.The graphics are awesome,and the level of detail is impressive.And the cops won't give up,so put the pedal to the floor and have a nice time.Your vehicle will get banged up every time you take a drive,trust me.If you are looking for this game here are some suggested stores:Best Buys,Walmart,malls,Toys R Us, K.B. Toys.I would recommend people to be at leats 8 years old to play this game. well,Happy Motoring!"
3,"The full version - great, but doesn't always work","The demo version of MM convinces you. The full version disappoints. I have Windows XP, and my Dell computer's keyboard takes about 5 seconds to respond sometimes when I play the game. If you're driving with the keyboard, you're out of luck. However: When it works, it's a super racing game with tons of races, and tons of fun in unlimited cruise mode, where you cruise around the city. Tip: if you go into dashboard mode and put the car into 1st gear, you can pretend to drive like a real person would. Overall, it's GOOD, but ONLY BUY IF: you have Windows 95 or 98 (what the game is made for) and you have the minimum requirements. XP users-you're out of luck. ME? You can try, but Microsoft always messes something up. Compatibility is the main issue here. (You can steer with the mouse, but it's really annoying. I haven't tried a steering wheel.)"
4,Funkblaster Sticks,"Smooth, nice taper, balanced. Love using these. Get them same affect with these as the heavy larger sticks, without the fatigue."
1,NOt what I was expecting at all.,"I have a few skin tags now and saw ad on TV for tag away and came here to get it and found what I thought to be same thing in its natural form not called by ""skin tag"" the brand name. It is something you don't apply to tags, but it says to dilute some in water a few times a day. I wanted to return it and find out I can't as it is classified as a hazardous material. Again with the deceptive advertising."
2,Not working,This did nothing. There were no instructions so I followed what I found on the internet. Nothing has happened at all.
4,I think it is an effective product,"I could see a slight diminishing of skin tags, but did not keep up treatments for long. Slight scent and a bit of a tingle sometimes."
1,This book is more for the Ninja Fanatic,"I've read many of the titles by Ashida Kim and have found them all of great interest. However have to say this time ""Sorry Ashida"" I found this book rather dissapointing the content was rather shallow and not worth the buy."
1,A dangerous path!,"I do not like to down anybody, especially when they take the time to write a book, but, Ashida Kim's book and many others do not show traditional ninjitsu. An important thing he misses is ""safety first."" These techniques will only get someone hurt by an attacker. The techniques are filled with ""holes"". He does have a few good climbing techniques but that is all. Ashida Kim's books are not for anybody who wishes to learn how to defend himself. He has too many steps to his techniques and constantly puts himself in danger of being, shot,stabbed or otherwise. The Ninja of Japan were supposed to be quick and virtually invincible. Oh, one more thing, his ""silent walking"" techniques are not silent. He lacks well-made Ninjitsu stealth techniques."
4,Really good!,"This book is the real thing! It teaches everything from survival, to ambushes, to bo (staff) fighting! This is a great book! But if it told how to use more weapons than the bo it'd be 5 stars!"
2,There is better info to be found on the internet,Its a fun book to read but it wont help you much. The US Army Field-manuals tell you more about any topic coverd in this book.
5,VERY GOOD!!!!,"This book told a lot about ninjitsu, and explained many escape and evasion technques. The book could have used more detalied photos, but in all a must read"
1,How to lose it - forever!,"I have just received MY mission. To tell everyone what utter b**locks this book really is. It is basically a few survival techiniques like how to catch fish with a spear (! ) combined with pure fantasy. The book begins with a meet at a secret mansion of course! Then the instructors recommend that whilst excercising, no water is drunk. Have you every tried working out without water? Ha. Please ignore Ashida Kim. He's cashing in on Ninjutsu big time. Hes techniques will only hinder you."
5,Ashida Kim is helping people...,"Ashida Kim has as always carefully written a helpful text to help others find the Way. Whether truth or fiction, the book is carefully laid out for those individuals who are capable to find the Way. The techniques in this book, as in all others, require a great deal of practice, discipline and self understanding to make effective, but once one has trained oneself to this level, the techniques do nothing but shine. One will find that other schools only delude themselves into thinking that the skill levels that those in their schools have attained are capable in combat. Some say Ninjitsu would never be good in a competitive arena, some say Koga Hei Long Pao Ying techniques are fairy tale. Only those who have trained themselves to a high enough level will be able to see past their own emotions and mental states to see these techniques for what they are."
3,ONLY FOR THE ADEQUATELY PREPARED.,"There are several different types of people that read these kinds of books. First, the impressionable young one, whose desire to become a ninja was founded after repeated viewings of the feature film ""3 Ninjas."" The latter are highly trained professionals, skilled in multiple styles of martial arts, dedicated, secretive, and destructive. For the former, this book will do one of two things: It will bore them, or crush their frail intellect. For the battle hardened master, this book will impart much wisdom, wisdom of the sword and wisdom of the mind head. Your really should only buy this if you are already a ninja, or just a lay person capable of the delivery of cool looking death bringing special moves."
2,"Retro Flix DVD suffers from image jitters, color bleeds and bad mastering...","I was so excited to find The Trials of Oscar Wilde available from Retro Flix, and in its original Technirama aspect ratio. However, once viewed I discovered the DVD mastering of this film leaves alot to be desired. Colors bleed, especially flesh tones, around the edges in most scenes, and there is an unnerving jittering in vertical lines (especially when a scene is panning); this also occurs in a scene where a minor character wears a pin-stripe of some sort. Maddening!As this is a DVD-R, I suspect the source material was taken from video, and not the original film elements. Obviously not enough care was taken in the transfer to DVD. I have to say that at this price ($19.99), I expected Retro Flix to produce a better product. Very disappointed, indeed."
2,colorized version was awful.,"I did not like it because it was colorized and Peter Finch's face was very pasty and swollen, not at all like the first version I saw in black and white. Great actors in this production but I wish they would leave black and white films alone, no coloring them please."
3,Another great movie with a mediocre transfer.,"This is a great movie featuring some excellent performances from top actors - Peter Finch, Nigel Patrick, and James Mason, to name just three. But like many of these 'manufactured on demand' dvds, the transfer leaves something to be desired. The picture could be clearer, however, at least it is presented in its proper aspect ratio, which is something.What I would like to see now is the release of the other 1960 Oscar Wilde film, ""Oscar Wilde,"" starring Robert Morley and Ralph Richardson (it would also be good to see Robert Morley's 1953 film, ""The Story of Gilbert & Sullivan."")."
1,"Whoa, these are bad!","First of all, everyone should be warned... these peaches are seriously ugly! They are a dark brown and a little scary to try. But I read the other review and decided to give it a try. They are so chewy that I could not bite off a piece. They have to be torn off with your teeth. Then there is the flavor or more accurately the lack of flavor. I guess with a good imagination, they might be said to taste like peaches, but they are pretty much tasteless. At 151 calories a serving, why bother? Now I realize there is a terrible aftertaste! Whoa, these are bad!"
2,It's poor information and missing many imprtant singers.,I am very surprised about this issue missin many imprtant singers and has alot of wrong information the 4th addition is much much better than this issue.
3,"Good book but outdated, new price guides available","I purchased this book back in 1997, at that time it was up to date, justfound my old dog eared copy, and it is still an enjoyable reference guide, but there are newer price guides availble now that I would spend my money on."
4,Stellar Live Act,"I've attended multiple Gomez shows and this 2 CD set definitely captures their energy. Three January 2005 concerts in San Francisco were condensed into one show-length setlist for this release. Luckily over half the songs come from the first two Gomez albums, classics that the band has failed to match. ""Here Comes The Breeze"" and several others clearly eclipse their respective studio treatments."
4,review from the Synthesis,"Compiled from three nights of material at the Fillmore in San Francisco, the two discs of Out West project an image of a band whose strengths seem only to be bolstered in the midst of a live performance. British five-piece Gomez have always had their share of jam-rock influences, but have managed to tread a cautious line between the infectiousness of `90s Brit-pop and the extended solos of a Bonnaroo Festival, without giving into either side's dangerous excesses. Out West is no exception, finding the band alternating between effectively concise songwriting and long-winded instrumental passages, often in the same song. The twenty tracks here are mostly comprised of Gomez originals, plucked from their four previous albums, with a couple Tom Waits (""Going Out West"") and Nick Drake (""Black Eyed Dog"") songs thrown in for good measure.- Landon MobladSynthesis.net"
2,Not for Gomez fans and faithful,"This album disappoints. The album is poorly mastered and the songs do not do justice either to Gomez's sound in concert or to that on their albums. Gomez favorites, such as Free to Run or Make No Sound, lack the special licks that made them stand out. No violin, no intricate chord progression; the detail is missing, and the bass overwhelms the composition that you expect from Gomez. Overall, the album sounds flat and lifeless."
3,EXTREME CAMPY FILM,"This is perhaps one of the better Teen-Ape video to date. A group of extremely unique and campy people decided to decorate for a haunted Halloween house, dedicated to Appollyon, the Greek/Viking Destroyer. Appolloyon appears (looked like Teen-Ape with a different mask) and kills a bunch of people.The acting is extremely bad by design as is the crude sexual dialouge. There is nudity and a sex scene which appears to use a fake male organ, which may be too realistic looking for a younger audience. A real organ would have given this movie a XXX porno rating had it been released to the theater. Good sound track and some of the dialouge was funny in spite of its crudeness.This is a 5 star rating on the campy scale. One star on a normal scale."
4,The Destroyer!,"Once again, these reviews are plagued by people who, no matter how hard they try, will NEVER get Chris Seaver's delicious brand of nut-slapping humor.Carnage is one of my favorite LBP movies. It combines the power of epic fantasy metal with enough blood, Seaveresque jokes, and lovable characters than you can shake your stick at. The tension between Teen Ape and Choach is hilarious, and watching Meredith Host play a Dominatrix is priceless. If you like horror, and you love bawdy, laugh out loud humor, you'll love Carnage!"
4,Disaster Movie,"Disaster movie, but I enjoyed the twists and acting. It makes for an nice popcorn and evening on the couch."
3,"If you are scared of natural disasters, don't watch it","Volcano is an interesting movie. However, if you are concerned about global warming or a super-volcano explosion in Yellowstone National Park, then this movie might scare you to death. This is an interesting disaster flick, one of the best I've seen. I know it is scientifically inaccurate, but it is a good movie. I've seen my share of disaster flicks, some of which scare me to death (like this one and Roland Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow which is the standard of all disaster movies, other movies like Outbreak and Armageddon don't really scare me as much because it is generally unbelievable). Tommy Lee Jones does bring a certain flair to this disaster film unlike Dante's Peak which stars Pierce Brosnan. It is a general unbelievable 1990's disaster film (probably because of the craze that emerged), but it is a good one but also really scary if you generally believe it will happen."
3,Princess of the Veil,Here's another book where I'm supposed to believe that captives don't really mind their situation. Some are even enjoying it. The captives are vikings and from their reputation I really think that they would be fighting until death. The idea for the book was decent but I found it dragged quite a bit. There wasn't much passion shown by either Iona or Magnus.
1,Pegagogical Nightmare,"I am so glad that, when I took my first Greek course 40 years ago, my teacher had better methods than this textbook. As a private tutor, I am wrestling with the book solely to help a student - it is admittedly a good reference source, but not to teach from. I have used Lambdin for Hebrew and Wheelock for Latin, both ""old-fashioned"" but good solid teaching books. This is simply a nightmare on the level with Weingreen for Hebrew."
5,The only ancient Greek instruction manual worth reading.,"Anyone seeking to learn to read and write ancient Greek needs this book, a little determination, and nothing more. If you are familiar with the only name in Latin instruction texts, <<Wheelock's Latin>>, this book will look familiar in layout and methodology. In comparison with another Greek instruction text I have utilized called <<Athenazde>> Chase and Phillips is better in almost every way: organization, methodology, and presentation. Don't waste your time with any other text, even if they may save you a few dollars--you will regret the loss in content and quality."
2,Outdated and Frustrating,"If you have little or no background in Latin, then this book will only serve to confuse and frustrate you. The introduction claims that it is meant for students with two years in Latin, and if you have had this much Latin, then you should have enough knowledge of the classical grammar systems to simply re-apply it to the Greek language. WIthout this background, or without a great instructor, you will be lost, because Chase & Philips most often introduces a knew form, gives one or two paradigms for it, and nothing else. Rarely are there examples and even more rare are parallels to English given so that you can figure out the essential basic translations. Beginners beware!"
2,Disappointing,"I was drawn by the nostalgia of generations of genuine Gottlieb pinball tables but soon found the physics of the games troubling. The ball has a 'mind of it's own' and many shots are extremely predictable which ruins the fun. Also, 3 of the 5 tables have 'background' music which overwhelm the original game sounds. Graphically the tables look great but the surely Microsoft could do bettter. Nice try Bill but no winner."
1,Poor Perfomance on Hot Machine,I have a relatively new machine 1.2 GB with a 64mb video card and over a Gigabite of Ram. I can run just about *any* game perfectly... This pinball runs terribly on my machine. I couldn't believe it was that bad.. so I tried it on another machine. Got the same bad results. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. It's a real disappointment.
1,RUINED,"WHEN I GOT THE BOX IT CAME IN IT WAS SMASHED.TOOK OUT THE SUNSCREEN AND IT WAS WRINKLED AND CREASED,WHICH MADE IT NOT GO ON THE TRUCK VERY GOOD.NEVER GOT THE WRINKLES OUT AND IT LOOKS BAD."
4,Very helpful,"This dictionary is very helpful, it is just limited to a few choice of words. But it is definitely complete. I like and also how simple it is to use."
3,"Great product, but don't get caught in the snow!","This makeup has great coverage and looks very natural. I was very happy with it until I was outside while it started snowing. When I came inside, my husband commented on all the marks on my face. Where ever a snow flake hit, the foundation discolored! I still use it, but definitely not when rain or snow is expected."
2,Don't like the texture,"I guess the coverage is ok, but I don't like the texture. It doesn't feel creamy and glide on like I want it to. It has a dry feel to it during application, but your skin doesn't look dry after you apply it. As I'm applying it, it dries up too quickly, and then I have to get more from the bottle. A little does not go a long way and I have to really rub to get it on. It also looks streaky after I'm done. It's hard to explain, but I just don't like it. I prefer cover girl."
3,Alright,"I bought this product for only a few bucks, the coverage is okay but it doesnt last all day. But for the price that it was it was"
2,Poor coverage,"While my service through Amazon was outstanding, I am not pleased with the product. I'm not sure if it's the color or just the claim, but the foundation does not cover like the sight said. I'm disappointed."
1,Cats can escape. DO NOT PURCHASE!,"Cats can escape from this carrier easily, by pushing against the zipper on the top flap. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM FOR A CAT! (It may be OK for a dog.)"
3,Potentially useful with reservations,"The strength of this book is that it's very clear in describing the practices Taisha was taught. Specifically the recapitulation meditations and what's come to be called Tensegrity ""magical passes"".What those practices can actually produce is another question.One can decide for themselves what use they are.It's a decent read but I can't assume it's true.One may want to read this article if one is inclined to take this as non fiction:[...]"
1,It's complete garbage.,"Like the Castaneda books, this is complete fiction. No wonder the author disappeared - out of embarassment for selling such junk. I'd run too, all the way to the bank after getting people to cough up their cash for such uselss drivel. Getting visions in a cave, the master is the property caretaker (apparently Don Juan in disguise), and sleeping up in a tree while hanging from a harness - utter crapola. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,A Total Waste of Time,"This book is hardly believable, and not inspriational. I can't see why the author wasted her time doing these excercises, and I feel like I wasted my time reading about them. I don't believe a word of the book, or her experiences--they are written as if they happened, but so totally screwy and nonsensical that the whole book lacks credibility. Don't bother, is my recommendation."
4,another brick in the wall,"I am new to the readings of Carlos Castaneda's books and am fascinated by them. When I ran out of his books, I looked for another to satisfy my hunger in this direction of flow. ""The Sorcerer's Crossing"" did help me to get my fix and I enjoyed it much. If anyone knows of another, please direct my new eyes..thanks."
5,A wonderful book to ponder on,I loved this book! The author is descriptive and clear bringing the reader into the story and making them really care about the characters and their feelings. The theories and practices that are described and interesting and easy to follow if one desires to do them. I loved this book and found myself wanting more at the end.
2,Something odd is going on in this book,"I've been reading a lot of ""Toltec"" stuff and re-reading Castaneda after having read his stuff years ago. I was excited to read this book as a counter-point to Victor Sanchez's stuff about recapitulation... but something odd is going on in this book. They (the sorcerers) are constantly lying to and tricking the young woman (which seems counter to the Toltec way as I understand it) and I see no evidence of love in their philosphy or their lives. These may be top shelf sorcerers but as they say in Texas... el Paso."
1,"And if you believe this one, I've got some magic beans.","How woud you like to be reparented; reborn; achieve limitless powers; special vision; and belong to a tightknit and exclusive society? It can be yours if you are needy and gullible enough and come up with $19.95. What a sad commentary on our culture that we are so empty and directionless that signifigant numbers fall prey to these fantasies and frauds. Endorsed by the ""Milly Vanilly"" of pop shamanism, Carlos Castaspellonya the author distorts and insults authentic Native American practices to promote her own ego trip.Wake up gullible kids they are laughing all the way to the bank and P.T. Barnum is laughing in cosmic dreamland. It is you, the reader who is being stalked.A little truth in labeling would help. But fantasy is less powerful than delusion."
2,I Didn't Get It!,"Duh, huh what? I just keep reading but failed to understand what this book was about. Maybe because I'm a CPA it went over my head. Would someone please explain this book to me. Thanks! Also, I've never seen an alien or been taken aboard a spaceship. I never have any fun."
4,Warm & fashionable,Love this sweater. It's warm and comfortable and form fitting. Looks great with jeans or something dressier. Only bad thing is the fuzz balls accumulating under the arms.
4,Lavender sweater,"I love the color. It's one of my favorites. The sweater is as advertised. It's comfortable, warm, and well worth the price."
5,Sleek,"I've used other .17 caliber cleaning rods but this is smooth velvet. Far superior to any of the others. Care must be taken when using though, unlike any other caliber, these rods are much more delicate.At first you may balk at the price but satisfaction will quickly follow."
5,Works for 22LR,I first purchased the 22-25 version. It works for AR-15 (.223) but was too tight for the 22LR rifle. This one works great for the 22LR. I just add an extra layer of patch to a snug fit.
4,Tipton cleaning rod,First rod shipped was defective had to return.Replacement rod was fine but for the money they should include a tip or two.
4,Case studies illustrating Senge's 'five disciplines',"A selection of real life stories of organisational and work place change selected to illustrate the range of issues encountered and the power of use of Senge's 'five disciplines'. Each story is short, well told and relevant. This is a thoroughly useful resource.There are 16 relatively short (av 7-8 pages) articles, arranged in three parts:Launching large-scale changeAddressing critical business challengesTransforming people and cultureThey are written by people directly involved in the process of change, ranging from the former head of Shell USA to change project managers. The stories are chosen to illustrate the use of a variety of the tools of systems thinking, mental models and team learning. All are taken from real experience of organisations that have devoted considerable thought and effort to achieving successful change."
2,Warning: Will NOT charge iPhone 3GS!,"I had ordered this hoping to be able to charge my iPhone 3GS, foolishly thinking that since it is advertised to charge the iPod, that it would work for the iPhone also. I was sadly mistaken. I connect it to my Brunton Solar Roll 14 and plugged in the iPhone and the phone said something to the effect of ""iPhone not compatible with this charging device"". Since I don't have an iPod, I can't vouch for its ability to charge one. I'd give more stars if I could test it on an iPod (and it worked)."
4,Just like old times,Fits somewhere between Gentlemen and Black Love in style. Fairly stripped typical Afghans style production and a must for anyone interested in Greg Dulli and Twilight Singers. Had a lot of trouble getting this in the UK. Interesting to see how some of the tracks morphed into Blackberry Belle era Twilight tunes. If only this guy would come over her more often.
4,Great Disc!,"If you are a fan of the Afghan Whigs this cd is a must have. It is a lot more rock than I would expect from Mr. Dulli, but that isn't a bad thing. Songs Cigarettes and Domani stand out and are surrounded by great tracks through out the album. No one fuses rock and R&B quite like Greg Dulli, and if the new Twilight Singers album is reminicent of these recordings we are in for in for a treat."
4,Dulli,What more do I need to say?! but this review requires me to say a little bit more. two more words in fact.
5,greg dulli is one horny musical genius!!,"This album basically represents most of the things that makes the mainman of Afghan Whigs and Twilight Singers so special: style, attitude, sexappeal. Greg Dulli has been active for some time now, and still this album stays as one of his most elaborate and glamorous work since Afghan Whig's 1965 album. Following the vein of songs like ""Something Hot"" Greg Dulli presents a 30 minute manifest of sex, broken hearts, drugs and revenge , basically all of his favorite themes but without the bleakness of his work with Twilight Singers or The Gutter Twins. Far from the sound of the older Afghan Whigs, this album keeps the dancing vibes of the soul background that keeps dominating Greg's signature sound and at the same time the raw strength that makes his voice so distinctive. I definitely recommend anyone into rock purchasing this one, and as for me, i will be singing: ""Get the wheel let's go for a rideIf you're trouble then I'll follow you down"""
4,Track Listing,Track Listing:1. So Tight2. Cigarettes3. Domani4. Early Today (and Later That Night)5. Golden Boy6. Black Swan7. Pussywillow8. Wicked9. Get the Wheel
2,No language selection,"The fact the character says two or three words in spanish, doesnt mean it is in spanish. There is no language selection, so the only choice is english, but it said both english and spanish in the description. I felt robbed, because english is not our native language."
4,Great Insight,"I've found this book very helpful in determining my ""gifts"" as well as my seven year old son's ""gifts."" It describes him to a tee! It has been a wonderful tool especially in the area of schooling; it gives good insight into strengths and weaknesses, areas of interest, and why children may do certain things that don't always make sense to us as parents. It certainly gives me more patience when teaching my son as a homeschooler."
5,"Discover your child, discover yourself","I have been pouring over this book for the last week. After doing a spiritual gifts study with our church group, we figured we couldn't know our young children's spiritual giftings until they grew up a bit. This book showed us otherwise. Very quickly we identified even our 3 year old's giftings. I'm so relieved to know how to encourage my children as they grow. While every parent knows their child well, and can often see where they have strengths and weaknesses; the deeper motivations and even possible hurts are much harder to see. Thank God for this book! Buy it-You will want to buy one for everyone you know. What a wonderful gift to new or experienced parents. I wish It wasn't over $20. I would love to stock up!"
1,Never received,"I ordered this book, but received ""Charles, Prince of Wales"" instead. I pointed out the error, but have never received the correct book!"
2,Book was very used,"The book material is great; however, I bought the book used and there was a lot of highlighting, notes, etc. It's condition should have been rated ""fair."""
4,Great for learning body parts and movement,"I'm a special education teacher and I'm always in the look out for fun action songs that are educational, fun and motivating. I think that the songs are age appropriate for young and older students. The songs get my students dancing and moving around while learning so much about their bodies and movement."
3,"Not great, but has some good tunes",I was looking for a few new cds for my 2 year old and came across this one. It is a mixed bag in that some of the songs are upbeat and fun to listen to while others are not. The Animal Action songs are good and so is the Beanbag Boogie. Interestingly the artists must have known they had a good thing because they repeat these songs on the CD. Note that this is quite an old product. The music recalls the era of Flashdance.
5,Fun and entertaining,"They use this CD at my son's preschool and that is how I heard about it. Watching him and his baby sister dance along to all of these songs is always entertaining! Also the benifit of, it keeps them away from the tv and literally keeps them moving. Great for winter months when they are stuck inside and they need to burn off some energy!"
5,Awesome,"I am very, very particular about my makeup. My roommate got me this eyeshadow for Christmas a few years ago. It lasted forever and looked really pretty. I wear it almost every day. The shimmer is really nice and the color is great; I have blue eyes and fair skin and it was perfect to use as a base or just alone on days when I didn't feel like blending, but just wanted to put something on and go. This is maybe the best eye shadow I have ever had. Maybe the item didn't come on time for other people, but that has nothing to do with the actual item, which is amazing."
5,superb!,"First heard Ann sing in a TV special, thought what a great voice, she should record... 2 years later I ran into this great cd, What a treat, never had any idea Steve Allen wrote with such witt, such passion ... and Ann brought them all to life. Only wish she would continue recording, perhaps some standards, anything to showcase her amazing vocals, I'm sure she would continue to shine. I'm amazed more music lovers are not aware of this cd, and I'm more amazed at how often i see them being offered for sale as a used item and at such a cheap price. What a shame. This one, my friends, is a keeper."
4,One song stands out.,"Steve Allen was a prolific, yet unsung (no pun intended) songwriter. Ann does a great job on this album as well. Her voice is powerful and persuasive.One song truly stands out and it's the lovely ballad: I LOVE YOU SAYS IT VERY WELL. In my opinion, it's the best song on the album and the one worth buying the whole darn magilla for!"
5,Classy recording,This classy recording by Ann Jillian and Steve Allen is loaded with wonderful new songs composed by Steve Allen. It has a great big band with beautiful orchestrations. I love it.
1,the order that wasn't,"After jumping through many of Amazon's hoops and repeating the same information over and over I was finally able to complete (more or less) my order. I live in Arizona during the winter months ""a snowbird"". After going around and around with Amazon trying to get my order sent to my winter address they proudly announced to me my order was on the way to my home in Minnesota. I needed the music album for a drama club presentation here at the Arizona resort. There's no way now I can use the music album for the resort show. Amazon wins. I lose."
4,Faithful screen translation,"First a warning to those who don't pay attention, like me. This offering clearly indicates Vol 1. Others offered aren't so clear that there are two volumes to this HBO miniseries, which must be separately ordered and purchased. Dumb idea. Anyway, I had read the book but missed this miniseries. This effort does a very good job of capturing the spirit and many of the specifics of the book. Much of the appeal of the author, Richard Russo, lies in his wonderful turns of phrase and descriptions of the mundane and not so mundane aspects of everyday life, especially small-town life. That's hard to translate to screen and does tend to make the pace somewhat deliberate. As usual, the book is superior, but the TWO DVDs are well worth seeing."
4,Phenomenal Broadheads,"These heads are great for the price. I have been using them for several years and have taken 4 deer with them. With the exception of a large doe that I hit a little back, none of them went more than 50 yards (the doe went about 150). The fixed blades are nice in case of mechanical failure, but I have yet to have them not expand. They punch cleanly through the rib cage and have a nice large cut, so they do their job quickly. The only thing that I don't like about these heads is that they don't last very long. By season's end the rain or high humidity will leave a film of rust on the blades. Which is fine, because then they turn into practice heads.Overall a very good buy. I highly recommend these."
1,How Many?,"This better be a teriffic self-delivering paper tube if it costs 63 bucks a piece. Otherwise, I think they are a bit over priced. If I were writing the ad for your company I'd have told how many paper tubes a customer receives for the price."
1,No Help Here,"I have two overactive kittens (7 months). I read the reviews so I thought I would try it. IT DID NOTHING!!! They are still eating my paperback books and ruining my oriental rug. I will not purchase this again, but try something else."
1,Useless,This did nothing for my cat when I brought a new cat into the house. I thought it may calm the existing cat down a little since she was on edge and even growling at us. Nothing changed with the FeliWay diffusers. I thought maybe it would be a little better than nothing at all. It did not help with the stress level for either of the cats. It was a big waste of money.
1,Complete waste of time and $$,"I have given this product a good and honest chance. Not only did it not do as advertised, my cats actually behaved much worse while the pheromone plugs were in place. Attacking each other more than ever, pooing and peeing in places they never had before.... I would NEVER have tried this had I known."
4,Seems to take the edge off,The product seemed to help calm our anxious cat immediately. She is a 5 year old Bengal that we got from a rescue and was not at all comfortable being around our dogs. In 4 weeks she has overcome most of her fears and freely interacts with them. The diffuser probably played a role in easing the transition.
1,No Help,"We purchased 2 of the plug-ins to see if our cats would stop using the floors and start using their litter boxes. The rooms we put these plug-ins are within the coverage suggested by the manufacture. The plug-ins didn't solve our problem, the cats still use the floor at times to relieve themselves and this was just 1 foot from the plug-in."
3,I just can't tell if it's working!,"I bought the feliway plug-in to try and alleviate some stress around feeding time, plugging it in near my two cats' food area. To be fair, there have been some other changes (mainly trying to go back to self-regulating after four years of only two feedings per day), so these might be why I haven't noticed any real improvement. My cats are still as neurotic as ever when it's time for breakfast or dinner. It might work better with the main problems it's designed to alleviate, namely litterbox usage, marking, spraying, etc. Fortunately we don't have those problems. Maybe it just doesn't work on food-related anxiety. So I'm giving it a 3, right in the middle."
1,A waste of money,"We have 4 male cats in the household and spraying is a problem.Well, just like another reviewer, our cats promptly sprayed the diffuser!I wasted $42...."
1,"Expen$ive$$$, didn't work at all...","Two cat household, tried two Feliway plugins to stop their constant fighting, or at least calm them down a small amount. Absolutely no effect from the Feliway. Also tried the spray on my older cat in his carrier because he becomes hysterical when he goes to the vet. Not effective there either. A huge waste of money."
5,Harmony in my home!,This stopped the fighting with a new adopted cat in our home with 2 cats. Wish I had bought this a long tome ago!
1,Didn't Work,"Our female indoor cat, after eight years of good behavior, recently sprayed the bottom shelf of a bookcase near our front door. I ordered this product, plugged it in near the bookcase, and hoped for the best. After about a week, our cat sprayed the diffuser. So the product obviously hasn't ""calmed"" her. Also the product isn't odorless as stated. Disappointing."
1,Didn't work for me,"This had no effect on my cats. I recently got a kitten and the adult male Bengal that I have is VERY displeased with the new addition to the family. I tried placing the unit near the food dish since that is usually where they are when they run into each other. I tried moving it to different places in the house and there was no noticable difference in his behavior. Granted, the little cat is either really brave or really stupid because he does nothing but torture the bengal but overall, I saw not change in behavior from this product."
1,Didn't work for us,The Feliway electric diffuser did not work for us. We have problems with two cats; they both continued to spray after the diffuser had installed for two weeks. Our situation may be unique; our cats certainly are!
2,The defuser Melted at the bottom and was a fire hazard. Also made the place smell like burning plastic.,however I manage to save the pharmone oil and put in in a spray bottle with water and the do scratch less. It would best to invest in the spray and its cheaper too.
5,Works Great!,"I already own two cats but a while back I took in a homeless stray, just until I could find her a new home.Unfortunately my other two cats reacted to this by fighting with each other all of the time. But within just a few short hours of using the Farnam pug-in all of the fighting stopped. It didn't make the cats love each other but at least they did start getting a long."
2,Didn't work for my cat,"My cat has hyperthyroidism and he was under additional stress as my parents had left on a vacation. He was yowling at all hours and generally unsettled. I bought this hoping that it would calm him down and maybe he'd stop yowling at all hours of the night. Unfortunately for him and me it didn't work. No noticeable change in his level of discomfort. What eventually worked was my parents coming home and even then it took a couple weeks for him to get fully readjusted.It may work fine in other conditions or other cats, but just a warning that it doesn't always work."
3,feliway diffuser,Bought because have 2 cats 1 male 1 female -someone repeatably urinating in bathroom rug or no rug and urinated 1 time on sons bed- used diffuser 1 week in hallway and cat soiled on my bed. Removed diffuser and have had only 1 issue in bathroom in the past month. Perhaps helped give attitude adjustment to cat.
2,Try the original Feliway Brand instead,"After great success with the Feliway-brand diffuser, I purchased a Comfort Zone refill without realizing it wasn't the same thing. This doesn't work at all for my cat. He's got an anxiety disorder and the Feliway brand diffuser really changed him back into the lovely non-destructive kitty he was before I moved to a new apartment, whereas the Comfort Zone brand only marginally improves his behavior and he's back to howling in the middle of the night.Comfort Zone is manufactured by Farnam, Inc. and includes Feliway (an artificial hormone patented by CEVA) among its ingredients. CEVA makes its own line of diffusers that are just called ""Feliway"" and are also available on Amazon. Maybe I'm crazy (or my cat is!) but I find CEVA's Feliway brand to be much more effective."
1,Made no difference,"I really wanted this to work. I have one big male former stray cat who likes to chase the other cats around. This upsets them. I have another skittish cat from an abusive home who breaks training regularly. After a month with the Feliway plug in, nothing has changed. My big male cat still chases the other cats, and my skittish cat still goes outside the box."
2,Didn't work for my cat,"Although this product did drastically reduce the amount of fighting between cats in the house, it did nothing to deter the one cat who likes to mark. In fact, we noticed her starting to mark places she'd never marked before, so we unplugged both diffusers about three weeks after plugging them in. If fighting is the only issue between cats in your house, I'd say this product works pretty well. However, I can't recommend it for problems with a cat who marks."
2,Feliway Diffuser,The first time I used this item which was a number of months ago it worked. After a few months away from it my cat started peeing again. I've been using it again for 2 months and it still hasn't worked. Can't blame the diffuser. My cat just has cattitude.
1,Waste of Money,"I used this for the full amount of time. I have three cats, one with a mild aggression problem and one that likes to chew. This product made no difference in their behavior. I placed it in an area that they traffic a lot, and the room is not super-big, so I'm sure the ""smell"" would have reached them. One of the cats (the aggressive one) did seem to react when he got close to the diffuser by wrinkling his nose up, but that was it.I would definitely not buy this again, especially for the outrageous price."
4,Worked for me . . . I think,"I'm not sure if things would have gone well without them, but I installed two of these when I brought a third cat (1 year old) into my home to introduce to my two existing cats (both 5 years old). There was a little tension, but nothing as bad as it might have been; they were sleeping on the same bed by the end of the week (completely isolated for the first three days). I kept Feliway canisters in all month in two areas of my condo. The only thing I don't like is that when the little canisters get empty-ish, they tip a little and sort of fall out of the outlet, but it's not a big issue. I'm glad I bought them! I guess I should buy more just in case they are the reason for the successful integration:)"
4,Works well although rather expensive,"We have used these diffusers for quite a while as we are a multiple-cat household. No method is ever going to completely reduce the friction between such territorial animals, but one of our cats in particular seems to be calmer and less fractious since we've been using Comfort Zone. My only complaint is that the refills are so expensive and that the diffusers have to be replaced every couple of years."
4,Seems to work,"After I moved cross-country with my cat, he seemed nervous and agitated in our new home. I was worried about him, so I bought this diffuser. It has seemed to work. Granted, part of that could be that he has just gotten used to his new home, but I feel like he got better after I started using it."
5,Great Item To help With Controlling Cats,This item works great if you have a few cats but if you have a whole Herd of cats like we do {All Rescued or left to us by our kids when they moved out} the item olny works for some cats and not all. In upstairs hallway it had little effect where the younger cats like to hang out but in the downstairs where the older cats mainly stay it worked very well..
5,Can't believe it works!,"I adopted a new cat. My old cat, Bellea, wasn't taking to her well after I went through the ""proper steps"" of introducing them (slowly, etc). Bellea started loosing her fur and just in general was moody (ie: suddenly didn't want to be held). I took her to the vet twice. 1st time she got a cortisone shot since he thought it could be allergies. 2nd time, she still wasn't getting better, he figured it must be the other cat. He said you could try Feliway, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I figured it was worth the shot (and since it's almost half the price of PetSmart it didn't seem like a bad deal).It took about a month before I noticed a real difference, but now Bellea's fur is growing back and she purrs again. Her and Bali (the new cat) will chase each other around the house. I have a big happy family again :)"
2,No visible results for agression,"Brought an 8 month old female in to live with a 12 year old female and, not surprisingly, the older cat had some serious territorial issues. Although she never really tried to hurt the smaller one, who is herself rather assertive, she hissed and growled and sulked. I bought three diffusers placing them in all the cats' haunts (near food, sleeping places, etc.)and also tried some of the spray. After three weeks there was no real difference. I then tried Bach's Flower Essence Rescue Remedy. Now, after eight weeks of cohabitation, the older one is no longer sulking and is hissing less. Feliway and/or Bach's may have contributed but it is impossible to tell, more likely the imporvement has come from time. Perhaps in such a case patience would have been the best--and cheapest-- recourse."
5,Helped our lonely stressed cat,"We had a set of sibling cats for 7 years. One of them died of an unexpected health complication earlier this year and the remaining cat has had trouble adjusting to single kitty life. We aren't currently interested in getting a second cat, so I decided to try this plug in to help with his stress behavior (mostly crying).This plug in made a huge difference. He became less stressed, seems happier and the early morning crying which had been driving us nuts diminished and then disappeared."
1,Didn't work for us,"I bought this product with high hopes it would stop my cat from urinating in the hallway and on our bathroom mats. We recently moved to a new house and acquired a new dog, and the cat has been urinating everywhere since. I tried this product for a full month and saw no change at all in her behavior. I really wish this product would have done what it says it does, but for us it just didn't work."
2,"Back to Prozac, unfortunately","My cat has a severe obsession with food that causes her lots of stress and anxiety, which in turn results in urinary tract inflammation. I have previously had her on Prozac which alleviates that obsession and keeps her urinary tract healthy, but I was hoping to be able use this product instead. I began using the Feliway right as I started weening her off the Prozac. I put 2 diffusers in our house to make sure I covered the areas she spends all her time. I tried it for a month and during that same time I also gave her 'Vetri-Science Composure Feline' supplements. Unfortunately, no luck. The obsession and stress returned. (Incidentally, she continued her bad habit of scratching the couch as well.) She's back on Prozac now and I'll just have to learn to be OK with that.There are other reviewers that have had great luck with the Comfort Zone Feliay diffuser, so I think this is a product worth giving a try. It does work for some cats."
2,"Didn't work for me, unfortunately","I got this with the hope of stopping the inappropriate elimination by one cat (of 3), but the problem still occurred after two days. I had tried almost everything else (and nothing medical was found, either) so I opted for this. Perhaps the air circulation was too strong or the room too big (a standard living room) but I won't need to get any more refills.If you have one of those Plug-In things you don't need to buy the diffuser. Just buy a bottle and fill an old Plug-In bottle."
1,This product made no difference in my cat's behavior,"I purchased this product after moving in with someone who has two cats. I have one cat who is afraid of the other two and has been too nervous to interact with them for weeks. My cat stays in the bedroom and hides when the other cats enter the room. Occasionally one of the cats, who is particularly aggressive, attacks my cat. When that happens, my cat sprays. I thought that the cats would get used to each other and things would calm down. When they didn't, I did some online research and decided to try Feliway after reading that a veterinarian was recommending it for just this type of problem. Well, the diffuser has been plugged in for three weeks and there have been no noticeable changes. I don't recommend this product. My cat is still spraying."
4,Miracle change in one of the cats,"This product worked amazingly well on one of three cats. He used to be extremely skittish, would run when you came near him, and would not allow you to pet him. After two days of this product he was starting to come up to us, meow, and now loves being petted. The product seemed to have zero effect on the other two cats. However, it is absolutely worth it for the change to the one cat. If you are having any problems with your cat this is definitely worth trying."
1,Didn't stop the spraying,My vet recommeded this product since I have a neutered cat that sprays. Used the plug in and the spray. Within a week the area treated area and the plug in were both covered in urine. Guess kitty told me who was boss ! He's now on behavior medication and doing fine. The feliway went into the trash.
5,Xanny for Kitties,"I recently rescued a 2y.o. cat who was pretty rough on the edges. He bit & swatted me couple of times and I have scars to prove. I know it was not anything viscious, he is just being a douche boy cat and who knows if he has been abused. I was closed to giving him away or taking him back to the shelter when my JRT mix started acting terrified around him. I know the poor dog got swatted twice. This dog loves cats. I guess she got hurt while I wasn't around. After 2 days of getting this diffuser I have seen the cat calm down, stopped hanging out and sleeping on my nice chair, he started sleeping in my room & never seen him swatted me or my dog as his game. In a nutshell, Feliway de-douchefy the macho cat! A miracle, indeed. Highly recommended!"
3,I guess feliway works....?,"I keep rescue cats confined in a sunroom with a deck.There seemed to be altercations frequently, until I purchased the feliway.There is also less ""marking"" of territories."
4,It works!!,"When used in combination with the aeresol spray it creates a calmer trio of feral cats in our household. It took a few weeks to see the difference but we plan on using this a few months before we stop, just to try living without."
1,Didn't work....,"I have two cats, one how likes to pee on my bed, a lot . Occasionally she'll knock something like a book or DVD off a shelf and pee on it. But she loves peeing on my bed, and walking around screaming. I've had to start covering my bed with a sheet of plastic, even when I'm in it. She knows how to use the litter box, I've seen her using it, and haven't found poop anywhere. So I got this hoping it would help, since the box said it was for marking, and a few people said it quieted their noisy cats. Seemed like it was working the first two days, but then it started again. May just have to build a pen and keep her outside....The other one likes to pace back and forth across my windowsill, which is about three feet long. Didn't help her at all. Definatly wouldn't recommend, or buy this product again... Waste of money."
1,it was like paying for air,"the best thing to fix your cat from spraying in the house is let him go outside a couple times a day they'll get it out of their system. these really do nothing, if you say they do you must be a liar"
1,didn't work for us but I think you just have to try it,"We have a cat that meows like crazy, and the vet suggested this. It really didn't make a dent, but it might really be better for urine marking. I would still recommend trying it, just wanted to give my own experience."
3,Cat's like to rub up against unit.,"Have been using for a few weeks and cat's often rub up against the wall unit. Though, have not seen decreased agitation between our 2 cats."
2,Didn't work for us,"I have a 15 year old calico that started to urinate outside the box, on the floor, on the walls. Tried Comfort Zone at the suggestion of our vet, but it did not work. She urinated on the Comfort Zone in addition to the other places."
2,Feliway Zone Diffuser,"I bought a refill for the Feliway diffuser.($30.99) I left the house for a couple hours and it smelled like an electrical fire. The smoke alarm was going. I finally unplugged all appliances and the smell was coming from the diffuser. I called the company. They said this was not uncommon. They said I could mail the diffuser to them, at my expense and they would send me a refund or a new diffuser. I really afraid of a product that has such a problem. I will return my refill to Petco. I also bought a NutraVet diffuser($32.99) and it does not emmit such odors.I do believe the products do work, but don't want my house to burn down."
1,Didn't work for my bully,"I had two cats that were constantly at each other. Jasmine pretty much laid around on a big pillow all day. Mogie would stalk her, run up and swat her, etc. all day long. I gave this product a try, in hopes that he would calm down and quit harassing Jasmine. I plugged it in right by her pillow. I didn't notice any changes in either of them. Mogie still bullied, and Jasmine still hissed, screamed, and occasionally charged Moglie. Jasmine remained totally stressed out, independent of the pheromone, so she has gone to another home. :-( (Mogie is a BAD cat, but a great companion for me. Couldn't send my soulmate away!) I still have another cat, so I'm going to try drugs next on Mogie. (A mild antidepressant that is known to reduce aggression in cats) In any case, this product might work for minor problems or as ""aromatherapy"", but it didn't work for us."
3,You have to give it a while,"I bought this for my cat who has feline hyperesthesia, or ""rolling back syndrome."" Basically, it's kitty cat OCD and she chases her tail and spits and hisses at herself. Very disturbing to watch--she is obviously in such distress. My vet suggested this product as she used the spray form at vet school and in her practice now to calm cats in distress.I used this in conjuction with some behavior modification techniques, so I can't say for sure her improvement is due solely to the Feliway, but she has been steadily improving over the past month. I bought a refill, so we will see--but I can't deny that she has improved significantly, and I was VERY skepitcal about this. If your cat has only episodic issues instead of chronic, I'd try the spray."
1,Did not work!,"This product did not work in my multi-cat household. I have one cat that is very aggressive to the other cat. It did nothing to stop the aggression. I was very disappointed. Actually, essential oil of lavenderLavender Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.sprayed in the air worked better! It might work for other cats though. This cat is very difficult to manage. Also, I have very high ceilings in the room I used it. That might have affected it's effectiveness."
5,Highly recommend,"This product works great for our cat. We have a 17 year old indoor only cat. Our daughter recently moved back home with her indoor puppy. The cat hissed and was very unhappy with this change so we put up a baby gate to keep the pets separated. Our cat still felt threatened and was still very stressed. She even began to pull out her fur. She also lost lots of weight because she was barely eating. I was looking for anything that might relieve some of her stress without putting her on Valium. She does not take pills well and since she was barely eating, putting it in her food was not an option. This plug-in diffuser works great. Within a couple of days, I noticed she was much happier and had stopped pulling out her fur. She has also begun to eat better and rarely hisses at the puppy anymore. The only negative is it covers only about 600 square feet so I had to buy two of them. Be sure and put a note on your calendar to buy more refills because they only last about a month."
3,Works in the immediate area,"This product works in the immediate area where it is deployed. I have yet to have a cat spray an area within a few feet of a diffuser. Unfortunately they are spraying other places nearby, and unless I buy one of these diffusers for every outlet in the house we may be out luck. Of note is that the primary cat causing all of the problems is possibly the most neurotic cat I have ever seen, and I have had the ""pleasure"" of living with quite a few over the years. So if your cat is a little more normal this product might resolve your issues."
1,very expensive but doesn't work,My tomcat sprayed the walls right next to the plug-in diffusers. I had bought three of them with refills...a lot of wasted money.
2,undecided,"This might work for you and your cat, but it didn't work out for me and mine. I quarentined my cat off for 3 weeks used special ""scent removers"" bought this plugged it in, unquarentined the cat...and she sprayed her first night out. Extremely frustrating. There are a lot of good reviews, so I suppose it can work, but not for all cats. It's up to you whether or not you want to take the chance and potentially waste money or potentially correct your cat. Flip a coin."
4,Stopped vertical scratching,"My 5-year old kitty scraped the paint off of every corner in my apartment... until we hooked up the Feliway! It supposedly doesn't work for every cat, but it did for mine!"
2,Only worked for a few days,"We just moved and our cat was going in his litter box, but also going in places he shouldn't have been going. After a few weeks and we bought the product and put it in the main living area where we (and the cat) were the most. It worked for a few days, but then the cat was right back at it again. I would say it's worth a try, but unfortunately it didn't work for us. NOTE...if you get the spray, make sure you spray DAILY like the bottle's instructions say or it won't be much help either."
2,Feline behavior modification plug-in,"Although our cats seemed more content when we used the plug-in, it did not help with our main problem. One of our cats sprayed when it saw outside animals on our deck. I think that our cat was just too excited and hysterical for the product to work. We even tried putting two plug-ins in the room where we had a problem. The only thing that worked was putting an animal shocker on our deck and keeping the wild animals away."
2,Feliway fumes,Used Feliway Comfort Zone Plug-In Electric Diffuser in hope to pacify a male cat from his bullying tendencies. I didn't see much help from this and had to resort to a one time medication that has helped. Other people I talked to have had some results by using this product.
5,It really works!!!!,The product is wonderful!!!! My cat stopped spraying the same day I plugged it and he is so calmed and sweet. I am totally amazed! I greatly recommend it!!!!
1,sux,Bought feliway. Tried it. Bout a week later my house smelt like burnt plastic. Found out it was the diffuser. It was leaking and the diffuser was covered in oil!!! Waste of money. Didnt even calm my 3 cats. At least i found it before it caught my house on fire
1,Cant tell that this product does anything,"Complete waste of money, at least for my cat. Maybe other cats respond great to this product, but I could tell no difference at all in my cat's behavior. I got this to help with spraying problems. Made no different whatsoever."
1,A total waste of money,Perhaps some cats somewhere are calmed by the sense that this provides. However my cats just not respond at all.
2,Didn't work for my cat,I must admit I had high hopes for this problem. There is nothing wrong with my cat she has been to the vet but she continues to pee everywhere.It was very very expensive and I would not purchase this product again
1,Useless,"I purchased this product with the spray and noticed no difference whatsoever in my male cat's anxiety or hyperactivity. For the price, I would not recommend this."
3,First timer,Just finished the 30 days of this product. Not sure if any changes have occurred with my cats. Its hard to say. Will purchase another to see thank you
3,Didn't help our cat...,Our cat has a lot of issues. He's just a big fat cat who likes to potty wherever he sees fit. He'll pee in his box and get out and immediately poop on the floor. ...because he wants his box scooped immediately. He is very pretty but not very bright. I can't say the product is faulty because it didn't help him. He's just a tupey cat.Had no odor. Easy to install. Just wish it would have worked.
2,Didn't Work For Me,"This product has a really good rep, but it just didn't work for me. My cat continued to spray. Turns out, he stopped when I got him a really HUGE litterbox, so that was the problem all along."
4,"so far, almost perfect","I bought this after 8 months of my cat not wanting to use the litter box. She would either pee/poop on the floor or in the back yard if I let her out regularly. Had discussed with vet that this may have been due to a combination of factors relating to competition with other animals (former homeowner's cat, visiting dog, visiting cats). But when the other animals left, the behavior did not cease. Since I started using the Feliway a month ago, she has only gone on the floor 1 day, and has actually resumed using the litter box. Hooray! Let's hope this keeps up!"
4,I guess it really does work,"I was very skeptical about purchasing this product. My kitty was immediately drawn to it once I plugged it in. He kept smelling it and looking at me contemplatively. I do feel it does calm him down at times but not all the time. What I do notice is that he is not marking is territory in the room anymore. I also used a cleaning solution that has pheromones as well. With this and the solution, it definately solved my kitty ""wetting"" our bed."
4,I think it works!,"Our 2 1/2 year old, Smudge, is painfully shy and became even more so when our 3 year old, Shadow, died unexpectedly of a heart condition. She withdrew to a tiny space in our living room and only came out at night. Couldn't be held or petted. With a lot of work we were able to get her out in ""public"" but and eventually would allow me (only) to touch her. This phase took a year. Smudge also began scratching our wool carpet repeatedly in one spot. We put the Feliway diffuser in an outlet near her hiding space a month ago. She's now out in public almost all the time, let's me and my family pet her, and in the past few days my daughter and I have even been able to pick her up! We just bought another diffuser for the room where we keep the litter box."
2,Didn't work for my cats,"I was really hoping that Feliway would help my two female cats get along better. They tolerate each other, but get into spats daily and I was so hoping that this would calm them down a bit. I didn't expect them to cuddle up together, but hoped at least for SOME result. I purchased two of these diffusers - one for my bedroom, where they sleep all night and one for the living room, where they sleep all day. But I didn't see any difference at all, unfortunately. I guess it was worth a shot, but it just didn't work on my cats. :-("
1,Feliway - disappointing,"I bought two Feliway electric diffusers, refills and a spray. It has had no effect on my two cats and the third cat I'm introducing to the household."
2,Didn't work for us,"Well, I had high hopes this would improve relations between two grumpy cats in my household. Unfortunately, we noticed no difference...in fact, I actually think it made things worse. They went from a hostile stalemate situation, to out-and-out fighting! I see from all the reviews that this product is helpful to many, though, so maybe we were just unlucky. If you are desperate, it's worth a try. I would never say that just because it didn't work for us, it won't work for someone else."
4,Seemed to work for marking behavior!,"My kitten had been marking (ie- peeing on the dog bed every chance she gets). I asked my vet what she recommended, and she suggested the pheromones. She explained that it works for some cats and not others, but it might be worth a try. It seemed to help our kitten, and we went a good month with minimal accidents. She recently started up again, so I checked the pheromone diffuser, and it was empty! I just ordered the refills and hope to have the same good results.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is no way to control the release amount. It's meant to work in a large space, but I'd like a way to emit less in a small space, like the bathroom where my kitten sleeps. I don't want to overwhelm her! It would also help it last longer, because we only got about a month out of it."
1,Wasted $50 at petsmart on this,"Plug it in and the cat backs into it and SPRAYS THE THING. Wasted $45.00 on this product at Petsmart. Actually increased the spraying of the male cat I adopted from then shelter. Kitty is a fixed males -- been fixed since early kittenhood -- 4 years old now, age of adoption.My 3 grand worth of new carpet can testify. The whole house is a mess. The vet has recommended Buspar pills and/or tranqs. Was hoping to avoid that, but either we try a pill- it works -- or we haev to sadly return him to shelter. Maybe that was why he was in the shelter to begin with, poor guy. We are crushed."
2,Completely useless on my cat,"Plugged it in and this product has had zero effect on my cat after several weeks of being in use. He still claws and scratches, and rubs as much as he used to."
2,No improvement...,"I purchased this product after a friend recommended it, saying they had great results with this diffuser. However, after almost 5 weeks in I have yet to see any change in my cat. All instructions were followed, it's plugged in near the spot she keeps urinating in and yet continues to do so. Her general behavior is still the same as well.Perhaps my animal is just the 5% who this product doesn't affect - but for a twenty dollar and higher product, I'd expect some sort of results."
2,doesn't work,Just didn't work for my cats. My one cat did not calm down at all. The others seemed indifferent about the whole thing. Definitely no calming in my house due to this product.
2,I'm glad I bought it on sale.....,"This had zero effect on my kittens. Maybe it works better once animals are fixed and don't have any pheromones at play determining social structure and all of that. My kittens had to be kept completely separate for the first two months, and I was praying this would not cure the problem, but at the very least ease the tension a bit. I had it plugged in right by the cat tree, and I saw no effect either way in those two months. I finally removed it once it was dried up, and the kittens have come to terms with eachother on their own. Maybe there's a psychosomatic effect when the owners think that this little white dome in the wall is going to cure all ills, or perhaps, as I said, it could not compete with my female kitten's pre-spay hormones. I'd say give it a shot only if it's on sale, and just start off with one. It was worth a try, I suppose."
1,LOL. Useless.,"I have 6 cats and this product is useless. None of them care about it. If you want to make your cat happy, buy them some Greenies, a LitterRobot, catnip, give them a window and affection. I consider this product a waste of money."
3,Not a tamer.,"Even though I have this plugged in and active, one of my cats went balistic when I tried to put her in her carrier to go to the vet. In fairness, she was feral, and even though tiny and normally sweet, she is very strong, and very wary. I was hoping to be able to cut her nails and maybe clean her teeth, then her eye went bad, and I hoped it would be easier to catch her and put her in her carrier. Didn't help."
2,Not sure if it is helping...,"I have a 15 year old neutered male cat and recently rescued a young female kitty. I got her spayed and slowly introduced them to one another over several weeks. The female is very energetic and gets in the male's face and swats him every couple of days. He just looks bewildered and runs away. I have feliway units in three different rooms and have been using them for about 5 weeks. Her aggression and his anxiety have not seemed to change significantly since using the Feliway. I will try them for another two months because I bought several refill units, but thus far I have not noticed an improvement after using the product."
1,can you give less than 1 star?,"I read the previous reviews on the product which made it sound so good... before I committed to buy over $100 worth including the 2 difusers and refills from this order- Dont waste your money...I have not seen any change in my 2 most agressive cats they are still fighting and marking where ever they want- by the way they are two spayed females in a home with 11 other spayed or neutered cats, in fact they have now started to attack some of the other cats. it sounded so good I am very disappointed it didn't work and its been a month....."
1,Didn't work,"Well, after reading all the reviews on this product, I decided to give it a try to see if it would help with my male cat's tendancy to pee everywhere but the litterbox. Not only did it have ZERO effect on my cat with the behavioral issue, it had ZERO effect on my young female kitty as well. (She has no behavioral issues)I was talking to my mom about the product and come to find out that they had tried it with my Grandma's new cat (at the time) a couple of years ago. Apparently Grandma's cat was rather high strung and always chasing people down the halls. So, my mom got this same product to see if it would calm Sissy down and she said it didn't work for her either.All in all, it sounds like this product works really well for some people which is great. I hate that it didn't work for me but I can say for the price I was willing to give it a shot! Good luck!"
4,I really don't know...,"if it works. I bought this for my cat this summer. He's got a funny personality and likes to be alone. He hates to be touched and sometimes can be angry if you do. I bought this hoping he would turn into the miracle pet everyone wants. The cuddly loving type. LOL! Well that didn't happen. I'm not sure if I noticed any change in his behavior at all. It's really a matter of personality in his case, not anger or fear. I gave it 4 stars because I'm sure it's a great product as it seems to work for everyone else. But I DID notice a smell. Similiar to basic soap, like when you buy bubbles. It can be strong, and I don't like it. I have noticed he is around me more now that I've stopped using it. I used it merely to see if it would make my cat a happier one, but he's just a typical Garfield! I love him regardless! : )"
3,Didn't Work For Us....,This didn't keep our cat from using the bathroom on our carpet in a particular room. We did have her checked for medical problem and she was fine and the litter boxes are cleaned every day. I was really hoping this would do the trick but we are having to find other solutions.
4,Seems to be good,"I think it helps my kitty to relax. It's hard to tell because he's so moody to begin with, but he's been a little more pleasant since I plugged this thing in. Only drawbacks are that it leaves an oily residue on things around it."
3,Didn't work for my cat,"I purchased this to help my cat while away on holidays. I was also hoping that it would limit the needy behaviour she displays when we return from a vacation.... several days of frequent meowing for attention at all hours of the day or night.It didn't work for us. But like humans, all cats are different and respond to products in their own way. So buying this product is a gamble."
4,A real help for cat owners with marking problems,"We had 6 cats (all female) and everything was going along quite well until my daughter moved back in with her three female cats. All of a sudden, several of them were spraying (marking territory) all over the house. Our pleasant home was smelling like a poorly kept-up catbox! This was recommended to us by our vet. We put in several of the Comfort Zone Fewliway diffusers and, while it hasn't completely stopped the spraying, it has considerably cut it back and eliminated it in some rooms. This is not a cure-all, but it's certainly a help."
2,Maybe for Your Cats,"When I first plugged the diffuser in, the cats seemed to relax. But I don't know that it makes any difference at all, really. The wild cats are still wild, and one of them still pees in inappropriate places. I guess I expected too much. My allergies do seem worse, though, so it's doing something."
1,Comfort Zone Review so far....,"My cat recently started urinating on our bed after we left for work in the mornings. At first I thought it was an accident or that something was wrong with her. Well, nothing Is wrong with her physically and she is still urinating on our bed when the opportunity presents itself -- which isn't very often anymore. We've been keeping her out of our bedroom when we aren't in there lately. In any case, I started using Comfort Zone about a week ago and I have to say that so far, I have seen ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE IN HER BEHAVIOR. I hope things will get better, but based on all the reviews I've read, people have seen behavior changes right away. Unfortunately this is not the case with my situation. I am still optimistic, but cautious. Will keep you updated shortly. Kelly of Philly."
1,did not work with a multi cat home for me,"I bought this to ease the territory as I moved in with my fiance, his 2 and my 2. We followed all the directions about easing 2 sets of cats into a new home, took our time over weeks. It did not work. I bought this to help ease the aggression and it seemed to do absolutely nothing. At first I placed it in a small room with one cat who was an indoor/outdoor and now very stressed about his indoor existence and initial isolation, it did nothing to ease or calm him. Later once I integrated the cats I placed the plug in the small living room next to a highly trafficked bottlenecked area where all cats had to pass to get to food and litter.... again I noticed no significant improvement on cat behavior. I used it until it was gone, about a month. I do cat rescue and work with cats a lot so I have some understanding of cat behavior and cat colony issues."
3,FeliWay - No change so far,"Its been almost a week now and I know the package says that it can take up to 6 weeks for any noticeable changes. I don't think I knew that before I placed my order. I was hoping for more immediate results. I am not giving up on it yet though. Still hopeful. You CAN NOT use the bottle with any other diffusers. That was one of my original plans - buy it, try it, test it, see if I can use the refills with other plug in diffusers. Nope. So just know that if you buy this you probably won't see immediate changes."
1,Does Not Work,My cat continues to mark in the room I plugged it into. Also- he seems to be even more on edge since I plugged it in. Now he seems to be looking around for another cat all the time.
2,"Very expensive, just watched cat urinate right in front of diffuser","We've invested in these for over a year and I wish they worked better. We have 2 spayed cats to whom we give nothing but love, but who have been peeing angrily on our furniture, luggage, and possessions in the past few months in reaction to our toddler. I just watched in horror as my cat fully emptied her bladder in my purse, which had my laptop in it. It was sitting on the floor right in front of the Feliway diffuser. Given how serious this inappropriate elimination problem is (I am so angry and upset right now), you would hope that some big bucks could buy a real solution, but that is not the case over here."
1,I guess it depends on your cat!,"Or 12 yr. old male American short-hair has always been anti-social and a little bonkers. Bonkers I can live with -but he recently began ""marking"" in one specific area of our home. He spends most of his day in the master bedroom, but would venture out to eat, use the litter box, and pee in the corner of my office. We placed the product in his favorite room where he literally spends 75% of his life. He no longer marks the office. Now he pees in the corner of our Master Bedroom. This is not an improvement in his behavior by any definition. Anyone want a cat?"
2,Weren't lucky with this product,I'm sorry to say that this product did not work for our cat. This was our last resort after trying so many ways to stop him from spraying. I wish there were some way to keep stray cats out of our yard. I think this added to his problem.
1,don't waste your money,"I bought nine of these things[[ASIN:B00008GQ4 C Farnam Comfort Zone Plug-in with Feliway for Cats (48-ml bottle & plug-in)]]for my house and put them in almost every room. My male cat marked under one and a couple weeks later about two feet away from another. I was hoping that this, combined with emptying the litter everyday, would solve my problems and save my new house. I have had to put my cat outside and have him cry at the door all day breaking my heart. I was looking for a magic bullet and this wasn't it."
1,Just simply Useless for My Cat,It couldn't stop my cat from peeing everywhere. My cat even did pee on this diffuser. T-T Keep your money.
2,What's The Big Deal?,"So, I bought the diffuser just about a month ago and I am not really sensing calmness in my cats. I think you have to put a diffuser in every single room of the house, but I hate to spend that much money if it still doesn't work."
3,Not sure if it is working,"I am not sure if this product is really calming my cats down. I bought Feliway at my vet's reccomendation to calm my cat that has been licking her fur off on her belly because of stress. I have noticed the cat licking the area a little less than before but it could also be due to the extra attention she is getting to relieve the stress. Also, this product is very expensive for no apparent reason. I could understand if it were some miracle cure but it isn't."
4,It works!!,"I bought this when my new kitten didn't get along with my other 2 kitties. Though it took a while to work, about 30-40 days, it did work, and now the kitty that no one liked is my little tabby's best buddy!! My Siamese still doesn't like the new kitty though, but I think that's just because she is the Queen of the house and sees the new kitty as competition for Mommy's love..hahaha...anyways, this item works, just be prepared to go through at least 1 refill before you see results."
2,Trying to get my cats to stop peeing...,My vet recommended this to me because my cats are peeing in the house instead of the litter box. They are still doing it so I am not sure if this product really works.
1,No,"This did not work for solving any cat issues. I purchased it to relieve stress of a new environment. It took me awhile to figure out what was burning when the plastic the feliway is contained in melted and all the liquid poured out onto the floor. It smelled like my house was burning down, luckily I found it before it actually did. Waste of money!"
5,Great product!,"I bought these diffusers as a last resort to try and combat my two males cats spraying my home/furniture/curtains, etc. As soon as I received the diffusers and plugged them in, I saw almost an IMMEDIATE change in my kitties....they were calmer, nicer to each other, and actually sitting next to one another...a miracle. Spraying had almost stopped (with the exception of two times, but there is a stray outside wandering my back yard which is causing my kitties to be more anxious) HOWEVER, as soon as the liquid ran out, I can see the old behavior coming back, so it's a MUST to keep the diffusers in use at all times, which may get pricey with the refills, but to me it's WELL worth it."
3,This seems to work,"Hey this seems to work, FYI make sure you replace it after a month, even though there is a little liquid in the bottle when I took it out to replace it it had a black char stains on the bottle, scary it could have caught on fire. It has been a little over a month since I replaced it, I notice that even though there is liquid in the bottle it will heat up enough to potentially catch on fire! Make sure you continually monitor the bottle, its hard sometimes because there is nothing alerting you that this stuff is running out because you can't smell anything."
1,It just didn't work,"I am very sorry to say this just didn't work for us. I have a 4 year old cat the started ""marking"" areas. This had no effect."
2,Wasted Time and $$,"New home and cat was really distressed. I think the previous owners also had animals so my cat was ""marking"" her teritory. This did not help. I would not recomment this product."
1,Doesn't do a thing.,"My cat has been under stress & urinating outside the box. The vet ruled out any sort of bladder or kidney problems, so I thought I'd try this. I have two of the diffusers plugged in & am also using the spray. It has had absolutely no effect after almost a month. What a waste of money."
3,iffy results,Have used the plug in for a few weeks. Not sure how effective it is. May need to give it more time. Wish the refills weren't so darned expensive!
2,Questionable benefit,"Maaaayybeeee it worked a little bit....almost impossible to discern. Our problem was this: one old, neurotic cat faced with a new kitten in the house. She essentially refused to come out of our bedroom as long as new kitty lived with us. It is possible she was slightly less upset and distressed after 2 months of Feliway, but not by a lot. Once the kitten found a new loving home with no mean old cats, our mean old cat was perfectly fine.I can't comment on cats with litter box issues, that was not our problem, but I really don't think it helped our cat be any less anxious."
4,Feliway,So far it seems to be working pretty well but the Feliway says it takes about a month to show improvement.
2,"Well made diffuser, but...","My vet recommended this to help out sooth cat nerves. Didn't do much for that. Do have to say that the diffuser is well made, so no qualms there."
3,Minimally successful,I was hoping this would be my great white hope for my little boy cat who is a sprayer. Where initially there was some calm everything is now back to square one. Disappointing to say the least.
2,It just doesn't seem to be working.,"I've been using this product for almost 3 months. It says that it sometimes takes that long for it to fully work.I got it because my cats have never gotten along, and they fight at least once per day. The one who is not the aggressor seems so anxious as a result (extremely skittish and hesitant whereas she wasn't prior to getting the other) that she does not use her litterbox.I got the second cat about 2 years ago, so maybe it's too late for them, but bottom line is it didn't work for me so I can't give it a high mark. They MIGHT be fighting a little less frequently than before, and with less intensity (they're easier to separate: clapping my hands from across the room sometimes works as opposed to before I had to go over to them and stomp my foot nearby) but it's still almost a daily problem."
1,Worthless,"I read so many reviews on this product that were positive, I was excited thinking something like this could help our ""house of feline unrest"" but what a complete waste of money. It has done nothing to calm the blind cat we have, nor the very timid cat. The most agressive cat who is mostly the whole problem, is not 1% different and all 4 cats get nothing but 200% love; affection and all their needs met in a calm and peaceful environment. Anyway, I'm glad I bought it here and not at the vet as it was twice the price and it would have been just that much more disappointing. I've even tried moving it from one room to another (the main room)in hopes that was the issue. Sorry to have purchased but had it worked, would have happily paid for the refills monthly."
1,Didn't work for me,"This was recommended by my vet. Unfortunately, it had no effect on my cats. Perhaps mine are just immune....."
2,Didn't Calm My Cat,"I was hoping Feliway would 'mellow' one of my cats that was being extremely aggressive towards a new cat I introduced into the household. Two diffusors and two refills, and I saw no signs whatsoever of any change in her mood/attitude. For this particular situation, Feliway didn't work at all."
5,seems to work!,"The diffuser/plug-in seems to have really calmed our manic cat down. It could be that he just got used to a more loving environment, but the change was too sudden for that. This wired-up cat is just about normal now! Truly a joy!"
4,Well worth it,My cat stopped urinating after plugging in the diffuser. It's well worth it to not have to worry about pet stains and odor.
1,STAINS THE WALLS,"I purchased four of these for our home with three cats. I am not able to tell if it ever worked because within two weeks, the walls above the diffusers were stained with a sheen/oily appearance. They were not placed near any sort of airflow or blocking furniture but rather in unobstructed outlets in open areas. So far, with one washing, the sheen remains. DO NOT BUY."
5,No more major fights,This keeps the cats form having major fights. I can tell when it runs out and I have to put in another bottle by how the cats act.
4,Farnam Comfort Zone Plug-In Diffuser with Feliway does seem to help!,"This product does seem to help, and it certainly is WAY LESS EXPENSIVE to buy it here than it is in the pet store. Be aware - you need to use this at least 3 full months to make a long term change, and use it in all the rooms where you have a problem - for us, that turned out to be almost the entire house! Also, we finally had to add some anti-anxiety medication from the vet because our cat, who had been doing very well, would revert to spraying everytime he felt too stressed again - such as when we had company.However, overall, this stuff (and the anti-anxiety meds) have made the difference between giving away and keeping a beloved cat.I also recommend that you buy or check out at your library a book on cat behavior and learn why your cat is spraying in the first place - this stuff isn't going to fix everything if the source of the problem still exists, but we do have altogether 3 much, much happier cats!"
1,Feliway Diffuser Plug in for Cats,"I wanted to help my new cat come out of hiding, and read that this is one of the feline problems this product can take care of. I left the diffuser in until if was used up, and had the cat enclosed in one room (she hid under the bed and would only come out at night when no one was around to eat, etc.). I didn't want our other cat to bother her because she was scared all the time. Anyway, it did not work. It did nothing. I wondered about the positive reviews on the Internet - were they from actual customers? At any rate I'm glad I bought this on Amazon- I saved $25.00. These cost $50.00 in the stores! Shopping at Amazon makes actual store shopping seem primitive."
1,ridiculous product,"this was an overpriced, useless, over-hyped product. Did nothing close to what it promised. After spending $49, ended up trashing both feliways."
1,Comfort Zone turned into More Stress Zone,"Sadly, this stuff not only didn't help, things seemed to get worse after I plugged it in. I adopted a semi feral cat last November. She is extremely shy. She won't let anyone pet her or pick her up. I also have an older female who is very upset with her new little ""sister"".After the feliway was plugged in, the new cat became very aggressive with my older cat, which in turn put her in a higher state of stress. Plus, the new cat has not become any more relaxed near people. She will weave in and out of my legs at feeding time, but she has always done that.There has been a lot of drama around here since I added the plugin. I was determined to give it a chance to kick in, but weeks later there is no improvement."
1,Didn't work for our cats,"We got this with the hopes that it would deter our one cat from urinating in a specific spot on the carpet, but it did not appear to have any effect whatsoever. Like one other reviewer mentioned, maybe our cat is determined to spray in this spot, but I don't necessary believe that to be the case. For the price, I expected better results."
1,encouraged rather than discouraged,"This was a complete diappointment. In fact, my cat seems to now be totally unstressed about scent marking in the same location - even though the product is situated in the immediate area. Perhaps I just have a determined cat, but I would not recommend this product."
1,Smelled like it was on fire,"Thsi product was horrible, after only a few days of being plugged in, it smelled like it was on fire and I immediately removed from the outlet and returned to seller! Be careful with this!"
2,Didn't do much,"I have one cat that is so stressed she has started to pull out her fur and hide in the litter box. I really can't tell that this product has helped any. She is still doing the same behaviors, despite the Feliway, and vet prescribed anti-anxiety meds. I really don't know what to do. My other cat has bouts of nighttime senility, where he roams the house meowing. The Feliway doesn't seem to have helped him either. I have been using it for a month now, and expected to see some change by now..."
1,Didn't Work At All...,"...For our problem.We purchased one of these in order to help curb our male cat's indoor spraying tendencies. He's an outlier, neutered but still sprays. And he loved to spray all over this diffuser. Continually, until it was an unusable mess."
5,It really works!,"We were very skeptical. One of our cats would mark certain spots (like corners) occassionaly. But we had no idea that he was daily marking the area rug in our living room! It got so bad that we had to discard the rug. We tried Boundary spray which would keep him away from the usual corner spots for a day, but the one time we forgot to spray, he would mark again. We were at our wits end and decided to try Feliway. We bought two diffusers and placed them near his usual marking spots. At first we also used the Boundary, but eventually we stopped using the spray and noticed that we didn't see any urine markings anymore. It took a few months but we can honestly say that the product seems to work. Our cat even appears more calm and pleasant. We make sure that we replace the container of Feliway every 5 weeks or so. It's well worth the money."
4,Noticeable difference in cat behavior,"We recently moved, and our two cats were having a few anxiety issues while adjusting to the new apartment. One cat, usually friendly and playful, would hide anytime a new person came into the apartment. The other cat, usually very docile, was being overly aggressive during ""play time"" with the other cat and with us.After buying the Comfort Zone plug-in, we noticed a gradual change in their behavior over about a week. Both cats seemed more relaxed and their behavior was more normal - more friendly and playful, less anxious and aggressive.The only reason not to give 5 stars is because the description says one plug-in vial will last 4 weeks, but the vial was nearly empty after only 2 weeks and completely empty after 3. But maybe there was more in the diffuser even though the vial had no liquid left. It is hard to judge when the plug-in actually ran out because the cats' behavior did not change, even after I unplugged the diffuser."
1,Did NOT work,"I tried using the spray as well as 2 bottles Plug ins. They were expensive, but since I recently moved, I was hoping it will help alleviate some problems. My cat still meows like crazy and urinated everywhere(he's neutured). I tried for 3 weeks and gave up. It seems like it works for some cats and doesn't on others. I'm the unlucky one I guess. Luckily my other cat has always been just fine. I just didn't see any differences when I used the product since the problem didn't get better at all, and it felt like a big waste of money."
1,Didn't work for me either.,"I have five cats and after using this product, plug-ins and sprays, for three months, there was no change in any cat. Spraying one still sprays, nervous one is still nervous."
2,No change in behavior,"I'm very disappointed. This product has not made any change in my cat's behavior. I ordered 2 Diffusers and 2 refills, I would like to return the unopened diffuser and refill."
3,Great At First,"I have been using this product for at least one year now. In the beginning, Comfort Zone was a miracle come true! My quarreling cats immediately became best friends, grooming one another, and contentedly sleeping together. Territorial spraying ceased! Each month, when the diffusers became empty, there was a noticeable difference with the cats growling at each other, and spraying again. A fresh refill changed them back to best buds. Comfort Zone had changed my war zone into a blissful haven of peace!However, the last few months, the effectiveness seems to have worn off some. No more snuggling between enemies. Spraying has resumed, and while most are tolerant of one another, there are a couple of them who chase each other at first sight.Perplexing to say the least. I want my cats to be happy and content again."
2,Didn't do much,I don't even know if this thing worked. Didn't seem to calm down the kitties at all. I think it's just one of those things that works great or it doesn't for me I didn't think it worked.
2,Noticed no difference,I noticed absolutely no difference using this diffuser. My nervous kitty is still as freaky as ever. He's not any worse but not any better either.
2,ehh I dont know?,"Could just be my cat, but he didn't respond to the hole plug in thing. I tried it for almost 2 month and nothing."
3,Not sure if this works,"I bought this to deter my cat from spraying on the couch and I am not sure if this is working. He sprays less, but it may be due to some other interventions that I tried at the same time."
1,Never Received,I ordered this product on 9/28/07 I never received it. I e-mailed them serveral times with responses that they would send it out again overnight. I asked for tracking #'s but never received them I finally at the end of Oct asked for a refund which they did give me. I can't belive that I never got the product.
3,Scared to use,"I would really love to use this product, but to me. The bottle/container stays too warm and i don't want to burn the house down. Maybe, i'll try to take that bottle off and place on another type of outlet that goes into the wall. I need to really calm my kitties down."
3,Amazon free shipping no longer a perk,I ordered this item on a Sunday. It was listed with super saver free shipping. I selected that form of shipping. Amazon sat on this order for five days and shipped on Thursday and I received it on the following Tuesday. This is the worst I have seen from Amazon on shipping.Amazon be realistic. Don't offer free shipping if you are going to sit on the delivery for several days. Other companies will offer free shipping and ship within 2 business days. You are giving me a reason to go elsewhere.
1,Diffuser,"I bought one of these and it didnt work on my cat. I also bought a second one hoping it would help. It did not, so I gave the cat to my Chinese neighbors and they Wok-ked him for dinner. No more Problems."
2,Did not work for me,"We have an older cat that we have had for 10 years and recently took in a 1 year old stray cat. Our older cat is scared of the new cat and stressed out. She has started going to the bathroom outside of the litter box (which she has NEVER done before). The new cat is extremely energetic and playful.I bought Feliway Comfort Zone because a friend recommended it to me (so I know some people have success with it-hence two stars). Nothing has changed in my cats. At first I was hopeful because as soon as I plugged the thing in, the cats were sniffing it. Unfortunately, their behavior didn't change at all. My older cat is as stressed out as ever. At this point, I'm just crossing my fingers that they'll eventually get used to each other.I'm happy if this product worked for you, but for me it was a waste of 30 bucks. If you try it, just keep in mind that it may or may not work for your cat(s)."
3,"works great, breaks quickly","I bought my diffuser 6 months ago and have replaced the pheromones every 4 weeks. It really cuts down on my cat's bad behavior & spraying, and eliminates it when the diffuser is working properly. The last two months the diffuser has stopped working. It still feels warm to the touch, but it dries out the pheromone ""wick"" and the liquid does not dissipate. My cat's bad behavior has increased as a result. I really can't live without one of these, I just wish the product would last longer than 4 months, as it is costly to maintain!"
1,Feliway Diffuser,"My vet recommended this, but told me that she's seen mixed success. Some people see an immediate impact, others don't. It was an attempt to calm my 1 year old cat, which is very skittish and keeps licking her fur off. It doesn't seem to have any effect."
2,Returned,"Something was wrong with the movie and we couldn't watch it. It might have been the formatt, but it wouldn't play. The service was exceptional and the return process was simple. Very little work on my side. Money was returned to my account immediately."
1,Not Working,I purchased this for a Christmas gift. My mom was sooo excited. This #%&* thing can't be viewed. I have not heard anything from the seller. I can't understand why it was sold and its not working. It's as if it was a bogus dvd.
5,The Lobster Kids' Guide to Exploring Las Vegas,"This book saved me a bundle of time and expenses when family came out to visit here in Las Vegas.I was a big hero to my nephews and nieces because I knew all the best places to take them to see free shows and other exciting things. My sisters and brothers loved me because once the kids had their adventures, they were free to do the adult vegas experience.Whether you live here (and have family and their children coming to visit) or whether you are bringing your family, this book has a complete list that will keep the little ones happy. From pirate battles to clown museums. Rollercoasters to wild life parks.BUY this BOOK"
5,Las Vegas - Family Memories to Last a Lifetime!,"I have enjoyed Las Vegas as a single tourist in the past, but when I decided to bring my family to Las Vegas, I knew that I needed to do some planning. I never knew just how family-friendly Las Vegas really was! The Lobster Kids' Guide to Exploring Las Vegas was a critical resource that made better use of our time. This book provided me with creativity and adventure. I was able to plan out our vacation and make last minute decisions with the direction from this author, who's descriptions were ""right on"". And, there was a large variety of activities to choose from. My family absolutely loved our vacation and I loved the ease of it all (descriptions, tips, directions, price info, etc.). Thanks to the help from this book, I know that the memories of our vacation will last a lifetime!"
4,Prices are out of date...,"The prices in this book are out of date - it was published in 2001 and in 2005 the prices across the board were about 30% higher. Budget conscious Las Vegas visitors will want to keep that in mind.Otherwise it was a terrific resource for ""freebies"" and kid-friendly attractions."
3,"""Identical""?","Denso list this sensor as an ""OE Identical"" sensor. I would in no way describe it as ""Identical"" as you have to properly position the floor grommet and tape it in place and the grommets which properly position the wiring under the plate on the frame rail and trough the two wire looms are completely omitted, and cannot be reused from the original. If you want to get really picky the wire sheathing is black (vs white) and the floor grommet is brown (vs black)."
4,"Excellent, Well-Written Book","This book was very well written. It provides excellent, well documented evidence to support the ideas of free trade. For those who are against free trade, I would recommend reading this book. The authors provide good, logical arguments for free trade and its benefits. As cliche as it is, no one can deny we are living in a global economy and this book clearly explains how the United States and we as citizens are playing our role."
3,"The book has excellent points, but stats get dry pretty quickly","Starts out interesting, especially where the author points out how Ricardo expanded Adam Smith's ideas of international trade, but in later chapters, he's talking about statistics in regard to specialized arguments...& gets pretty boring. This is coming from a guy who found The Wealth of Nations to be an entertaining read."
2,not worth it,I bought 2 of these cables for my 51 and 32 inch flat screen tvs. They were used to replace my basic/cheap coaxial cables that I have had for years. The one cable switch had no noticable change in visual clarity. The second switch actually caused the image to be worse so I switched back to by basic coax. These cables are not worth buying unless you just want a white cable over black and dont care about picture quality.
1,I rather be a Zombie then read this again,"This is yet another very dissapointing zombie graphic novel. If you want no story, no likeable characters then I suppose this graphic novel is for you. This comic much like Dead West and Containment attempt to make a very action oriented ( poorly drawn ) and next to story type of zombie read. Those sort of stories work better on film but when you have to read it you want something more like Walking Dead ( which I loved ). They dont really explain why the odd looking man starts this whole scenario..... they go into some very minor character detail about the annoying blonde character but still not enough to explain why she is the way she is. The guy who I guess is suppose to be the main character isnt even very interesting and then the cheap attempt at a love interest thrown in at the end has no sustence either. They make no attempt to explain really how or why the zombies start evolving..... everything felt very very rushed and pointless."
1,"bad even by steve niles standards, this is a total hackjob","here comes some more watered down paint by the numbers horror from steve niles, perhaps the most overrated writer in the comic book industry today. this is probably one of the worst zombie stories i ever read. from the completely nonsensical way that the zombies come about, to one dimensional and unlikeable characters, to some cooooorny action sequences, i would say you are better off lighting your money on fire than supporting this mans ""writing"". seriously, i dont even think he is trying anymore. while i wasnt a big fan of thirty days of night, its sequels, wake the dead, or anything that niles has written, at least those books had some redeeming qualities. this one has none, unless you are into the dwyer art. some people cant stand the art in this book, for me it was the only thing halway decent to be found. in my opinion dwyer has an interesting style, too bad it had to be wasted on this garbage book."
4,A Fun but quick read,"I do not read many Zombie comics, but I love stuff about the end of society as we know it....This was a quick read. I thought the art was pretty good. The characters were not super great. Both are hateful lowlife scumbags that personally I felt had no redeeming qualities. I was rooting for the Zombies in this one.Overall a quick read, nice color pictures. I am probably being generous with the 4 stars, but I liked the pictures (and I read it twice the first day I bought it)."
4,Very informative.....,"Good book overall. The book really is not just about the SS, but the Third Reich as well. For many people (myself included), the Third Reich was a bewildering array of ministries (some with redundant functions) as well as sub-departments. This book goes into great detail about the interaction between these various ministries and departments (some state and some party) that collaborated in the Final Solution.My two gripes are the written jests in the text and the some of the information is either outdated or incorrect. I would still recommend this book."
5,Perhaps the best performance of a French baroque opera by an American group. . .,"To be honest, I had fairly low standards for this work. There have been fairly dull performances of baroque operas, especially French ones, by American groups. And I had heard mixed reviews of their performance of Ariadne. But I was pleasantly surprised, for this recording surpasses some of those done by Reyne, which all seem to be good, but not terribly energetic. This, on the other hand, is probably the best period instrument recording ever attempted by an American group, especially when one compares it to those done by Pearlman and Boston Baroque, or those atrocious ones by Palmer. Perhaps Niquet, Ham, Christie, Minkowski, or Rousset could better perform and record this opera, but as of yet, they haven't. And there wouldn't be a need to."
5,The Science of Luck,"This is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. I just finished reading it for the third time. Each time I read it I am fascinated by the author's ability to capture and express an almost inexpressible truth of the way life works. The main character, Havoc, calls it *the Science of Luck*. Look to this book for more than the thrilling read it is."
3,Miasma,"Despite the blurb and critical praise, this late novel is really no more than a thriller, not a ""crime novel."" As a thriller, it is quite successful, with some notably tense scenes in the London fog, although the finish on the French cliffs makes very little impact, and the plot, with its mixture of albinos, hunchbacks and dwarves, psychopathic ex-Commandos, saintly canons and buried treasure, is preposterous in the extreme. As a novel, it is less successful. Jack Havoc never comes across as the truly wicked man all the other character say he is, and the famous scene in the church is grossly over-rated. Thus, a rather pretentious return to the author's early `plum pudding' approach combined with her late style, which is often very good but equally often requires close and careful reading to avoid headache (particularly in the scenes with the ghastly ex-service men)."
5,Review of Nomads of the Eurasian Steppes,"The scope of the Nomads volume is astonishing - the Eurasian steppes from Eastern Europe through Central Asia and to Mongolia, with a millennial time frame that encompasses components of the Late Bronze and the whole of the Early Iron Ages. The anthology's 10 authors, all of whom are recognized specialists on steppe nomad prehistory, synthesize Soviet research undertaken between 1960 and 1990. Hundreds of line drawings, bibliographies, index."
3,Experiments on the Frontier of Science,"This is an interesting an short little book describing various simple machines that you can build (that actually work sometimes) to test psychokinetic abilities and other little known and unexplained phenomena. The author challenges his readers to experiment scientifically and to try to come up with hypotheses as to why these machines work. Emphasis is wholly on science and rationalism, not occultism."
5,The Reveiw you see on top,"The review you see on top is not about this album.Angela is talking about an album called ""Christy Live at the Point"". This also a brilliant album but it was recorded two decades after ""Live in Dublin""!"
5,Oldie but Goodie,I saw this movie in the 70's and it scared me to death. Today in comparison to some of the movies out.. this was still top notch. I often wonder what this movie would of been like if they would of had the CGI's and all the other tricks of the trade they have today. The producers and writers of the Exorcist were way ahead of their time... it's still scary and creepy. Leaves a person feeling uneasy for sure. Awesome movie.
1,No Key,"If ever they bring this amazing product back, buy it, just not from this vendor since they send the manual and the CDROM but I can't get past the setup screen because they didn't send the serial key to install the package. I've been deceived."
4,Really good disc,Its a really good up beat listen thru and thru. All I can say is the last couple songs sound a little forced and I don't really dig them. Good combo or hardcore yelping and melodic singing and the guitar work on this album is pretty good. The solos are cool and I really enjoy the overall guitar tone on this cd.
3,Good But...,"There is Definatley some undeniable talent here, with the lead guitar player and the mix of hardcore and melodic vocals, it is a nice mix, but the this is definatley not suicide notes and butterfly kisses, it is much more watered down, Unfortunatley.And aslo Atreyu is much to overrated, i see them everwhere now and people don't have enough good things to say about them. Once bands get as popular as this they start losing their hardcore edge. But this cd is still worth buying if you want to hear some great guitar playing."
4,Good. But could be better.,"What frustrates me is bands like this. Atreyu had a great singer, when he sings, and they have a good guitarist, and the rest aren't bad, but they get too hung up in that hardcore/screamo genre. Some of the songs have great choruses and great riffs and some songs are just ruined by the hardcore screaming overload. If they tried to use their singer more like Avenged Sevenfold does it would be great.Another problem is u can tell their guitarist holds back on a lot of songs especially on the short instrumental song which is basically one riff played over and over and over again with a little variation. You would think an instrumental would be a chance for their instruments to shine and toss a few solo's in there, but guess not.Needless to say, this is a good CD and the more i listen to it the more I like it.Stand-outs tracks:Demonology and HeartacheThe CrimsonThe Remembrance Ballad"
1,Abomination knew exactly what I was thinking,"First of all let me just say I was one of the guys who liked Atreyu before because I easily fell sucker to poor riffed, easy to listen metal. This meant when they released -The Curse- and radio hits like ""Right Side of the Bed"" and ""The Crimson"", I instantly fell for them. Now I've matured and grown over this slop like I did with Linkin Park and a heap of others.Read Abominations review, as he is a man of sheer brilliance! He only speaks the truth! Listen to worthy Metalcore like God Forbid, Trivium, Shadows Fall, Lamb of God, Darkest Hour, Killswitch Engage, Maroon (no not Maroon 5 you ignorant retards who actually purely enjoy this), Underoath, and Zao. There, I just took a minute of my time to give you GOOD stuff to listen to! For any other good stuff read Abomination to God's review in the spotlight or Jeremy's under mine."
3,Atreyu is rokken!,"The first two songs on the album, ""Bleeding Mascara"" and ""Right Side of the Bed"" are absolutely amazing. I personally like 80's metal like Motley Crue, Dokken, Dio, etc. I listen to NO new bands whatsoever because I think they suck. I was in my girlfriend's car, and she was listening to this CD. It honestly caught my ear. There are guitar harmonies and a very talented rhythm section.As for the rest of the album... I went out and bought myself a copy and the songwriting is just poor. Too much growling... no melody. You can tell they worked their asses off to produce two singles, and the rest of the album is a filler. It's a shame. The guitarists are really talented. If they worked harder on melodic riffs like ""Right Side of the Bed"" I would like them a lot more.In total, I say not to buy the album. Download the two singles and you have the only good material on this album. I hate to bash this band, but I must be brutally honest."
3,interesting,"well i have to say that their first disk was rock solid amazing and spectacular all put into 10 very well written songs. unfortunately since suicide notes was such an extremely well made disk its so hard to create another that will even match up to it. so im pretty happy with this disk i cant really see it being made in another way. i dont like the tones of the guitar on this disk or the change in his growl(he sounds like a screaching pig) i do like the new taste in solos and the raise on the lead singers voice. the first disk kept them new and fun to listen too, this disk just puts them under that same classification as FaTa and other hardcore/emo bands."
4,"Good, very good","Now, I know I said 'good, very good' but there are flaws. I love this album, I LOVE IT, but compared to Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses, it's not as good.It's good, it's very good. Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses had a touch of brutality to it, a very brutal touch to it. This album... not so much, and I think that's what's lacking in it. It seems more punk-rockish now, I mean, some of the riffs are really punk, and the melodies (while amazing) resemble those of pop-punk bands. This leaves out the formula for SNABK, which was pretty much full on brutality with moments of tranquility. This has more tranquility than brutality... there's not alot of screaming.Not to get me wrong, this CD is good, but not as good as SNABK. I love both but damn this was different."
2,Gives metalcore a bad name,"I'm really sick of the growing metalcore trend in the past months. This CD isn't super terrible, but it's just too trendy and not really metalcore, at all. People buy this Cd and think that atreyu is so hardcore and heavy, its so stupid. If you're a 13-14 girl then you'll probably love this CD and think the dudes in atreyu are hot and sexy goths. Go ahead, follow the trend with Senses Fail, Killswitch Engage, and Avenged sevenfold. But if you want some non trendy true metalcore listen to: Zao, The Agony Scene, Glass Casket, Preminitions of War, etc. And if you're a true metalcore fan, you'll stick around longer than this fad."
2,Kinda shitty,"I was really disappointed with this CD. I was expecting more after Suicide notes, but I didnt get it. None of the songs got me at all."
2,I'm posting this again because they are just that bad.,"What exactly is this band? Are they death metal? No, because the vocalist cant sing deep enough for that, perhaps when he gets through puberty he can get close. Are they Black metal? No, because he cant sing fast enough for that. Are they even metal? Well yes, I mean they do use a lot of guitar riffs from 80's metalica, but then again who doesn't these days.One minor thing worth mentioning about this group is that their name is the same as the brave little indian boy from the Never ending story. But musicaly this band is just another group of imitators that cant match the quality of anything they try to copy.They might have good lyrics, but we may never know because the singer cant seem to open his mouth wide enough to make any sounds beyond growls i could hear by monkeys at the zoo. And at least monkeys have some emotion to the sounds they make."
1,hardcore? bitch please,"this is another garbage album. just like bleeding though, throwdown, and 18 visions. if you seriously want this crap then download it. dont waste money on this crap"
2,UGHHH!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS NOT GOOD MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOOOOORRRRIIIIBBBBLLLLEEEE!!!! BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD MUSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,this album is amazing,"A friend of mine told me about this band, he shouldn't be my friend anymore. The singer on this album is amazing...I didn't know it was possible for a vocalist to sound like a sea lion on steroids and a crying preteen all on the same album! The guitars....goodness....they must be the gods of self mutilation because they ruined my life. this is an insanely horrible album and I truly do not understand why this band is popular. I read an interview in a magazine I bought (it had dillinger escape plan on the front) and read an interview with Atreyu. They were talking about how good they were....they are not good. they make me want re-eat my own entrails. Don't buy this album and if you do..I hope it makes a nice coaster for you."
1,Angst,"As if metalcore wasnt a chainsaw to your head enough, its absolutely ridiculous when metalcore bands mix emo with there already inoriginal sound. This band sounds like a even more flaccid Killswitch Engage, a Hawthorne Heights/Silverstein with downtuned guitars. As if it wasnt an abomination already, they even sing about vampires. Yes, thats right, vampires.And you couldnt get any g*yer."
3,i wish i could give half stars.,"it's a good album. sorta metal-goth-core mix. if you only like one genre of music you probably won't like it. if you use the word poseur on a regular basis or think you're really hard you definitely won't like it. if you enjoy music for what it is and not for labels then you probably will enjoy the curse.suicide notes and butterfly kisses was a bit harder. more of a hardcore feel to it, a bit less singing. it wasn't as smoothly produced as the curse either.i've heard atreyu praised and bashed. it depends on your specific preferences in music, but over all i've found them to be a solid band with interesting thoughtful lyrics, and fun music. take it how you will."
3,a good step forward for hard music,"many would not call this style of music metal, but in order for music to get better it has to grow. i would say this is metal, just not metal at its heaviest. this band has a little courage to walk a line between being too heavy for true mainstream & too light to be embraced by people who only like extremely heavy stuff. I'm of the opinion that a person should have some flexibility in their music taste even if the flexibility isn't a lot.when music like this is disregarded as not being heavy enough i wonder what makes the people doing this think they are so hard."
5,F*ckin Awesome,"This is the most perfect hardcore CD ever made. This disc is much heavier than its predecessor, and the lyrics, vocals, drums, solos, and riffs are crystal clear. This album is super dark and super loud. 'This Flesh A Tomb' is one of my favorites on the album as well as 'The Crimson', 'Bleeding Mascara', 'Corseting', 'Right Side of the Bed','Demonology and Heartache' and 'Nevada's Grace'. Actually, every song on this entire album is stellar. If you are into heavy music, get this disc immediately, and don't burn it because a band that can make a CD this good deserves every penny it makes."
3,Overrated,"With the rap/metal nu-metal subgenre pretty much the way of the dinosaur, it appears that this ""metalcore"" brand of metal is now the new nu-metal. Bands like Killswitch Engage and now Atreyu are finding much success using the same formula that bands like In Flames have been using for years (then again, In Flames isn't quite In Flames these days). That aside, Atreyu's ""The Curse"", which has been one of the more well received metalcore albums of late, but there isn't really anything special about it. ""Bleeding Mascara"" and the catchy ""Five Vicodin Chased With a Shot of Clarity"" are great tracks, and the guitar work is surprisingly good, but in the end ""The Curse"" just leaves you with a felling of having heard this before, and heard it done much better. Atreyu's ""The Curse"" isn't a bad album at all, but there's a lot better material out there that is more worth your time than this."
2,i give them points for trying,"what could have been an interesting and intellectual combination of styles turns out to be a bit of a disappointment. had atreyu combined all the best aspects of metal (technical, heavy guitars), emo (smart, heartfelt, emotional lyrics), and hardcore (unbridled energy), i would have enjoyed this immensely. unfortunately, they didn't combine these aspects as well as perhaps they could have. it seems that they try way too hard to be gothic and depressed and use some of the stereotypes and cliches of 80's metal, while trying to be hardcore by screaming over all the tracks.a bit of a disappointment, but its the trendy thing now, so if your into the whole scene-kid thing, this might please you. but i think that it could have been much better."
5,THIS IS GOOD,"This is a good cd. It's one of those cd's you'll treasure. Its great to put in the cd player and pump up the volume, only problem is the chorus in the remeberance ballad (...)."
2,eh,There are some really good parts to this that is pretty much metal. but then they come in with that crappy whiney singing voice and it sux from there
3,What Happened Here?,"Atreyu's first album Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses was good. I used to listen to it all the time, because it had a lot of intensity, and Varkatzas had a voice that could made it work. But when I picked up the Curse, I was so disappointed. It sounds like he's not even trying in this. The music was great, and the lyrics were awesome, but Varkatzas could do a lot better. Saller's voice gave it more depth and emotion, but it wasn't the same feeling. Atreyu's first album was metal, but the Curse has a little bit of everything."
3,Now I'm pissed.,"SHUT UP ABOUT 14 YEAR OLD GIRLS LISTENING TO THIS!! Stop sterotyping us, and it's not even true. MOST 14 year old girls listen to hip-hop. Only the ""goths + punks"" listen to Slipknot and stuff. I, on the other hand, am not a Slipknot ""omygodtheirsooooheavy"" zombie. Like, no.On the contrary, I am a huge fan of ""heavy"" music, with my favorite metal bands being Finntroll or Children of Bodom.Anyways, Atreyu is sort of... weird. It's sort of a combination of melodic death (with the solos), black, and emo-screamo punk? I dunno. I guess it's an okay album, but I don't like it that much.If you're usually a punk/emo fan and you like this, you might want to check out some real death/black metal (but please no nu-met.. I mean pop) and see if you like it. Who knows, you might have a new favorite genre!"
1,...What a horrid excuse for music,"I have a few friends who are big Atreyu fans so, I was told to download a song by them. When I first heard Bleeding Mascara I think I literally died laughing. The music is full of ridiculous screaming that sounds like someone is conspipated, the drumming is awful, and the guitar is just repetitive. I have no idea who decided to call this ""hardcore"". If you want real music go listen to Fear Before The March Of Flames, or Love Lost But Not Forgotten. But, if you like Good Charlotte or Simple Plan you'll LOVE this album!"
4,"Pop Music, Oh! Of Course!","Yes, this is definitely some pop music. Last I heard Atreyu will be touring with Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson. Pshh, Give me a break. To wholeheartedly disagree with every review on here that has the audacity to call this album ""poppy"", would be only the sensible, smart and correct thing to do. This is not poppy by any means, it is after all, still metalcore. They didn't dress down their music like for example, The Used did with their sophomore effort. No, no. This is still metal with tons of screaming, thrashing guitar riffs with 80's reminiscent guitar solo's and destructive use of the drums. Indeed this isn't the greatest album ever, but to call this poppy would not be an over-exagerration of a pathetic opinion, it would be a lie."
4,A Gateway album.,"For a long time I listened mostly to Ska music, and then Atreyu became the biggest band around, now normally I would hate them just because they sort of surround me, t-shirts, lyrics written in notebooks, MSN Messenger Screen names, etc. But I decided that, like every band, I would listen to them before deciding if I hated them, much like My Chemical Romance or Fall Out Boy, but I was surprised, I really enjoyed this album, 'You Eclipsed by Me' hit pretty hard and that along with 'Bleeding Mascara' became some of my favorite songs even though screaming music wasn't something I liked at this point, thanks largely to this album it grew on me very fast, after this I discoverd Alexisonfire which I think may be a better band, though Atreyu will always be big because it was the first hardcore band I liked a lot. So everyone, as trendy as they may be, Atreyu is worth a look."
2,Metal for Teenage Girls,"Atreyu is just one of those bands, I mean, they're definetely not bad, but this is NOT REAL METAL. This CD in particular sounds like some sort of weird Hardcore/Emo Metal wannabe style, and for me it doesn't work."
2,Mehh... another wasted talent.,"Being a huge fan of ""Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses,"" I eagerly awaited this follow up and in the end I couldn't have been more disappointed. Atreyu showed a lot of potential on their first two records and their live shows were top notch. For this album the raw aggression captured on the early records was compromised in favor of watered down vocals, mediocre songwriting and a strong emphasis on a psudo-goth image. I have no problems with bands trying to break the mainstream and getting their music heard, but it's apparent what the intentions were we it came to ""The Curse,"" lay down a couple of singles to win the hearts of the pimply faced Headbangers Ball fashionXcore crowd and fill the rest of the album half assed works and cover them up with a little ""studio magic."" Do yourself a favor and skip this one completely and go for Suicide Notes.., and while your at it pick up the new Unearth which is a much more promising listen."
3,Redundant,"Do like hearing the same song over and over and over again? Yeah me neither. Atreyu seriously needs to change up their music making equation here. Screaming verses and singing choruses works everyonce in a while, but every damn song!? Change it up for god sakes!Now for some good news. There are some pretty good songs on the cd including ""Bleeding Mascara"" and ""The Crimson"". But the rest is basically all the same.If you wanna hear Atreyu at its best, go buy ""Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses"". Otherwise, you can let your friend buy ""The Curse"" and burn it from him/her."
5,Way too often overlooked - raw and heavy...,"I must say at first I didn't think much of this band, but, they kind of grew on me like something that hurts at first, but, the more you do it, the more you like it... They are now becoming one of my favorite bands and I have purchased all their albums... I am a long time metalhead and it is refreshing to find something that still makes me want to 'bang my head' on occasion."
2,Not worth it,"I enjoyed ""Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses"", but there is no way that ""The Curse"" can be put alongside the aforementioned album. ""The Curse"" actually does have its share of memorable tunes, like ""Bleeding Mascara"" and ""You Eclipsed By Me"", but songs like ""Nevada's Grace"" and ""Right Side of the Bed"" distract me too much in considering this a worthwhile album.Oh, did I forget to mention? ""The Remembrance Ballad"" is a GOD AWFUL song. This song takes my attention away from the good tracks because it IS so INCREDIBLY AWFUL. It's sometimes hard to think a worse written and a worse produced song than ""The Remembrance Ballad"" in the history of rock. Otherwise, this album I guess still isn't worth it, but just keep in mind that this disc contains a horrible horrible song called ""The Remembrance Ballad""."
4,"I'm a lover of Music not ""metalcore"" or ""hardcore""","I don't understand why people say their bands sell out when they try to change things up a little bit. If you're looking for REAL sellouts to their genre check out 18V's new cd. This band did change their sound a bit though from their last release and it's not bad, but their original sound was better. This is by no means a bad CD. Bleeding Mascara and the Remembrance Ballad are 2 of my favorites. There wasn't one bad song on this CD...and I don't see how in anyway this CD became popular. I don't know what MTV or Fuse channel you're watching cause their never played on there unless it's Uranium or Headbanger's Ball...both show's of which don't really support mainstream rock or metal. Disappointments are bands like ""Metallica"", ""18 Visions"", or ""Hed P.E.'s"" latest CD's. I'm a lover of music but my soul lives for metal, unlike most of you who are just lovers of a subgenre of a genre and hate all other forms of musical creativity....shame on you!"
2,nothing at ALL compared to suicide notes,"but I gave it two stars for the ""right side of the bed"" track.nevada's grace isn't so bad, either.still though, the worst song on suicide notes is better than the best song on this CD."
5,Five Vicodin Chased with a Shot of Clarity,"This is another great album that too many people talk smack about, those people can just die. Atreyu is not emo and their not screamo. Their in a very rare genre called 'Da Bomb' that alotta people say ""These suckas don't belong in there"". Well they do and their very good artists that make beautiful art. The main highlights of this album would be ""Five Vicodin"", ""Bleeding Mascara"" and ""Nevadas Grace"". If you were smart and not closed minded about awesome music then buy this mo'fo and jam your little heart out."
4,...eh...,"really good album but cannot even hang with suicide notes and butterfly kisses...it just didn't have the perfection and edge as their first one...maybe it's the new bassist...most of the songs are really good though, ""bleeding mascara"" is damn good...i got the limited edition version with the bonus track bon jovi cover song and it was a litte hokey...there's too many melodic vocals...i've been listening to harder stuff lately too so maybe my taste for melodic hardcore has gone down but i still listen to suicide notes and butterfly kisses...i guess after you make a cd like that, it's hard to follow it up especially when you have to make adjustments to new ""talent""...i'de recommend it..."
3,Steps Forward and Steps Back,"The Curse shows progression in the first two actual songs. ""Bleeding Mascara"" packs a ton of energy and breathtaking guitar work into less than two-and-a-half minutes, and proves how talented Atreyu is. ""Right Side of the Bed"" is a bit pandering, but the guitar work is still inspired. The rest of the album rarely manages to leave a mark, however. Like others, I do not doubt Atreyu's skill. I do doubt their consistency, which is the biggest problem with this album. How some of these metal bands manage to write boring songs that are so loud is beyond me, but Atreyu did that here too often, regardless of the song's intention."
4,"Nothing new, but still pretty good","As many people have already noted the sound of this album is nothing new. Yes, it is metalcore, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Take the time to listen to samples of the songs and make your own opinion about the album. If you like it then buy, and if you don't like it then don't buy it. Just don't base a decesion about your own musical tastes on the reviews of anybody else including me."
3,I like it,"I pretty much bought this cd after hearing ""Right Side of The Bed"", to this day I still Love that song and it just doesn't get old to me for some reason. Other than that, I really like The Crimson, and Bleeding Mascera, I really wish I would have had the cd with the cover of ""You Give Love a Bad Name"", because that's a damn good cover of a classic, but I didn't. Anyways their first cd is a lot better, and darker as well."
2,"eh, get butterflies","ok i loved this cd when it came out, but then i listened to it about 3 months late, and it sounded horrible, the singing gets annoying, i get sick of the same verse chorus verse song structure, songs are somewhat slow, and to think of it someone said he sounds like a pig combined w/ a chimp monkey when he screams is actaully true, over produce and watered down, get butterflies"
1,Victory Does it Again,"Emocore has officially become the new ""scene"" thing to listen to. So, you have to buy this album if you're a 14 year old who wears tight pants and horn rimmed glasses. The fact of the matter is, these emocore bands are not really emo. Real Emo (emotional hardcore) is Rites of Spring, Fugazi, Moss Icon, or Jawbreaker. Bands that are branded emo by Victory Records and MTV are just pop-punk with whinier vocals and depressed lyrics. If you like music marketed to the masses that has no real musical value, this is for you. If you want a challenging listen or innovative instrumentation, look elsewhere."
3,I don't get it.,"There seems to be a lot of animosity towards this band / release, and for no discernable reason. I can understand the nu-metal kids and people ignorant of the hardocre / metalcore scene that this band was (once) a part of; no one accused nu-metal fans of be of any rational breed. I can also understand why the hardcore purists don't like it: their merch is sold in Hot Topic, they wear makeup, they are on Victory, a label quickly losing credibility in certain circles.The music is isn't all that atrocious as people exaggerate it to be. It is neither nu-metal nor metal nor hardcore, but it is close enough to those genres to be essentially the same, looking at the grand scope of music (not that we should expect certain music fanatics to look at the grand scope of anything beyond the next show).Just another example of silly scene politics clouding level-headed judgement. Just listen to the music."
2,come on.....,"say no to fashioncore.this band is overrated and overworn. i swear if i see another queer in an Atreyu shirt i will vomit.these guys arent bad at playing their instruments, they just.... arent good at all. the last album was tolerable at best, but this album is just pathetic.i suggest readers find more interesting music to listen to than the pathetic soundtrack to teen angst, ""rebellion"", sense of acception and that is the pathetic fashioncore/metalcore genre today.catchy music does not equal good music."
5,You'll Never Garden the Same Way Again!,"This is an absolute must for any gardener - no matter what your preference or forte. Everyone has that shady area where nothing will grow. Be prepared to change your taste. When you see this video, you'll be planting trees, erecting break walls, building lath houses - anything to get more shade so you can begin your own relaxing retreat like Mr. Benner did. The bonus - very little maintainence! Every gardner, from expert to novice will benefit from this video, and learn how rewarding little to no sun can be!"
4,Excellent for variation of gypsy music,"Love this CD; if you have one gypsy music cd this is a good start to the collection. I became interested in gypsy music after watching the movies, Chocolat and The Man Who Cried wherein there were wonderful music sequences. Excellent variations, superb guitar work---makes you want to dance, dance, dance! I play this in background at parties and it really sets the mood for a lively atmosphere."
4,The Langston Hughes Reader,"The Amazon.com purchase I made with Goodwill of Greater Washington could be described as high on the scale of customer satisfaction. The book arrived almost a month after the purchase, but it was in just printed condtion, with no marks and no wrinkles. Every library should have a copy of The Langston Hughes Reader. I had written a Social Science paper on one of his poems and wanted it for the next paper. In addition I dedicated a Rapper Rhyme Widget based upon his work at [...]. Hope for the best with Goodwill of Greater Washington."
3,1/2 price at Lowes,I got this lamp at Lowes home centers...same lamp made under the porfolio name for $29.00
4,A Pleasant Adventure,"Although Talbot Munday is better known for writing the more popular King of the Khyber Rifles, this story of desert adventure is sure to please. It is narrated by an Englishman who accompanies the famous American James Grim on a perilous journey across the desert to Petra to confront, in his own stronghold, a ruthless and deadly robber called Ali Higg. A powerful desert chieftan, Ali Higg has been terrorizing the Arabs instead of uniting them. Along with James Grim is his Sikh friend and companion and an aging thief and his many sons and grandsons. This troup of misfits set out to accomplish the impossible. Will they succeed? It's a good read."
3,Lots of data but hard to follow timeline,The book has a lot of historical information undoubtedly from proper sources. It is a bit difficult to follow the sequence of events.
3,"Good first half, rest a complete bore","The details of the battle plus the history are well explained, up to a point. The author could have trimmed it a bit. I don't recommend this book for the casual reader. History buffs will love most of it."
1,Not What it Appears,"From the title and description in the dust jacket, I expected a tour de force of the conflicts between the Napoleonic Empire and the British, the only European country to avoid defeat by the French. These issues are mere tangents in the book, and given minimal attention. Another reviewer noted that ""Nelson's Trafalgar provides a wealth of Napoleonic naval trivia"". Well too much trivia becomes trivial. If your objective is gain an appreciation of the lot of the common sailor, the primitive nature of their food diet and healthcare, this ""exhaustive"" book is for you. If you are interested in the larger global or at least European issues that led to the conflict and impacts of Nelson's victory, look elsewhere."
2,details,the book for nelson's death. took pages to die. many collected letters from survivers. cold and detailed. covers the battle but left me almost bored. It is however the book to read of the sea battle. Did not like it but it does cover the battle.
4,Well written account about the famous sea battle and life at sea in general,"Roy Adkins has written a lively tale and account of the Battle of Trafalgar, which pitted Lord Horatio Nelson against the strategy of Napoleon Bonaparte in the epic sea battle. Adkin's does a thorough and interesting job describing the every day life of the British sailor at sea and the hardships they had to endure. The book goes into the background of the two famous empires the British and the French and the reasoning of why they had to fight. Adkin's historical background of Lord nelson is an interesting read and has a bit of tragedy in it. Nelson was a tough sea going man and was better off at sea then living his life on land. The description of the battle is an excellent account and it is a definite page turner with interesting tidbits in every page. Highly Recommended!"
5,"Awesome, heartwarming stories for any age :-)","I purchased Second Chances last year for my 9 year old son so I knew this book would be just as good. If you want to read very short stories about stray dogs who found loving homes, this is the book. It will make you laugh, cry, and just feel good all over.Everyone should ""adopt"" a shelter or stray once in their life. There is is no better feeling...they seem to have a way of ""finding you."""
5,Beautiful In Every Way,"I love this book so much that I decided to donate a copy of it to my local public library in memory of my sweet doggie-man, Forrest.I've owned it for years and have read it several times- it never gets old.I am glad to see they have come out with a second edition, I will definitely be buying it very soon!"
2,Kismet without connection,"These are without a doubt heartwarming stories that leave the reader thinking ""What if that person hadn't been at that spot at that time"", or other mind-bending questions, but all in all, the lack of detail provided in the stories fails to draw the reader into them, leaving a choppy feel to the whole book. This, in turn, fails, to do what the writer hoped to accomplish, which was to show the fantastic chemistry between people and dogs, and demonstrate that dogs are capable of thinking and emotions far more complicated than humans have believed thus far."
5,really heartwarming,I loved this book so much.I recently adopted a dog after many years of only pedigree versions. I will always save a life and adopt from now on! My other 3 dogs with papers aren't so sure of this decision!
2,"Fun toy, bad kit","I have a number of Stikfas that I use as unique dorky decoration at my desk at work. They're rather fun to assemble and pose,and while this kit seems like it would be good, the plastic in my particular kit was extremely shoddy. A number of ball joints were larger than the sockets, and the plastic was incredibly stiff, which ultimately led to the pirate figure being physically impossible to assemble. A number of the pieces broke during assembly. I am unsure if it was my individual kit or if there was a problem with this particular line, but either way it was incredibly frustrating.Just the same, should the pieces prove durable, this kit has a variety of options for assembly, and the toy line overall is great fun."
3,A little disappointed,"One of the hip pieces broke off when my son tried to put him together. Also, he had trouble with one of his legs and his hand until he switched them around. It would be nicer if a more detailed instruction booklet came with these little guys to show how to put them together when they have extra parts. But thanks, he's enjoying him now."
4,Here's a gal with a positive attitude and a joyful heart,"After seeing Chonda live in Chicago last year, I am convinced that she's our very own comedian angel sent by God to wake and shake us! Chonda's book is a true inspiration, but actually listening to her speak and sing is an even bigger treat. It's hard to find her tapes, both video and audio, but definately worthwhile to search for. I've purchased three extra books and tapes to give as presents. This is truly a MUST Buy for Christian women of all walks of life."
4,An amazing testimony of Christian strength,"I saw Chonda at a Women of Faith gathering in Cincinnati. She moved 15,000 women to tears of laughter and emotion. If she is ever speaking in your area, go see her! Truly amazing and inspiring."
5,Trampoline Safety Pad,Was told by salespeople at various stores that it would be more cost effective to buy a new trampoline. This pad does the job at a fraction of that cost. The trampoline is being used constantly by my kids and a lot of the neighborhood kids and it no longer looks like an eyesore.
3,Quality Pad. Bad Customer Service.,"My trampoline is 12 ft and made by Leisure Kingdom. I could not find a reasonably priced pad for it in the 12 ft size, so after reading a few reviews, I purchased this one and hoped that it would fit. I did not. The return information on Amazon's site states to contact the seller for return instructions. I sent an e-mail and left a voice-mail message. Neither one got me a response from Fun Spot. Finally, I just mailed the thing back to Fun Spot and got a tracking number from the post office. Then I filed a Dispute with my crdit card company to get my money back. If the pad fits your trampoline, this will be a good purchase for you. It appears to be well made and durable. However, if it does not fit or you want to return it for some other reason, be prepared for no response from the seller and no help from their customer service."
4,Great CD for the classroom,"Music is a helpful tool for teaching many concepts. This CD has really good songs to use throughout the school day to teach through music and movement. It also breaks up the day and gets the students' brains working again after having to sit, be still and listen for long periods of time. My favorite song is ""Say Hello""."
4,"Remember, this is live. . .","OK, Steve's voice is not what it used to be but as I have said in past reviews, Steve Walsh at 80% is still better than almost anyone else at 100%. This performance blends the best of the old and the new with inspired arrangements and great execution. Bands in general have forgotten all about dynamics and diversity and Kansas gives it all. I would compare this CD favorably to ""Two for the Show"" and note that age has taken nothing away from these guys when it comes to energy. Don't let memories of the past take away from the offerings of these now mature and great musicians. Well Done Kansas!"
3,"Tremendous music, but Steve's voice....","The easy part to review here is the music and sound quality. It is all top notch, except with Livgren being noticably missed. But everything there is still really solid. But Steve Walsh's voice is a whole other story...Steve Walsh's voice is - in a word - PAINFUL to listen to. That sweet tenor is long gone, having given away (unfortunately) to the shreds of the vocal chords he has left. How other Kansas fans can even listen to it is more bravery than I can muster... Really. This is not listenable.One reviewer said Steve's voice ""is still at 80%"". Ummmm, no. At best, he is at 10%, and maybe less. It is too bad... Because with his voice intact, this could have been amazing. But - instead - it is just painful."
2,The actual performance of the material is lacking,"I'm comparing this CD to Two for the Show and Live at the Whiskey.The performances of the songs are rather lifeless and lethargic.The instrumentation is still on top form, but the vocals are weakThe sound quality is excellent.The keyboards seem to be buried in the mix, which is a shame because hearing them more would have improved thingsWhile the first cd is 62 minutes, the second cd is only 34 minutes, not including the 5 minute video where the video quality is very good.Overall it gets a 3/10By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
1,Say what ?,"I'm stunned at the other reviews I'm reading.I think this thing is an awful monstrosity;easily the worst of their live discs, by a mile.""Somewhere To Elsewhere"" the studio disc whichpreceeded this one by two years, was possiblytheir best ever. But it does hint that Walsh'svocal prowess is diminishing.There's no hint aboutit here. He throws his weak, geeky tenor aroundhere like a fry cook slinging hash when he wouldhave done everyone a great favor by playing it cooland making sure the notes and melodies were strongand sharp. Further, he's not much of a keyboardplayer, and I think the band needs to get back tofull strength with a Livgren type multi instrumentalist.This live disc is a fiasco. I can't believe they putthis gruesome thing out. If you love ""Two For The Show""you'll be feel [cheated] by this mess."
4,Good but not the Best!!!!,This CD is pretty dam good if your a punk/rock person like me. The only thing wrong with the CD is guys voice is a little off what ever his name is. If he toned his voice down to something I would give it five stars. Other than that the songs are pretty good. ...
2,Am I The Only One Who Thinks This Cd isn't any good?,"Alright, well it isn't ALL that bad. There are a couple songs that are really good like ""Poetic Tragedy"" and ""Taste Of INk"", but the others really didn't meet up to my expectations. If I didn't have a cd burner, I WOULDN'T waste 16 bucks on this cd."
2,Name of the Band Describes the Sound,"If I'd been in a coma for the last 6 years, I think that Imight've been moderately impressed with this album. Anhonest debut effort from a fledgling band, it has ecclecticmoments of rage, pain, reflection, and melancholy, craftedwith noteworthy musicianship. I think, though, that theywould've made a better effort had they never heard Jimmy EatWorld, Finch, or the Deftones. I think the band name speaksfor the sound, which sounds like it was tailored directlyfrom their influences. It lacks the catchiness of a popalbum, but it's not artsy enough to be an indie-rock cd...."
5,hooked,"real rock is back and back in the form of the used. as you see i said rcok and not punk well thats because you can't put them in just one group. one song may be poppy then the next hardcore, but it doesn't matter, this band is the future of rock. bert's lyrics are just insprational. songs like, ""taste of ink"" and box of sharp objects"". it alos helps that bert has the voice of an anjel at times, he can sing with the best of them, but you can't forget his screaming, move ove jon davis, bert has arrived to take you throne. now go out and buy this damn cd"
5,Astonished-,"I bought The Used's second album and loved it. After I bought their first album I thought less of their second. I haven't stopped listening to their first cd in at least two months. Some of these songs will stick in your head for days. I do not at all regret buying this cd. This is The Used to the fullest. A astonishing, beautiful work of art. The songs are personal. Maybe Memories about singer Bert McCracken's drug occluded past, On My Own about Bert McCracken and the gutarist Quinn Allman's shacky relationship. The Taste of Ink is the history of the band. Great song with wonderful, down to Earth band members. My favorite."
2,Used up.,"I would have to say that this cd is not very good. I am myself a wide listener of music and appreciate all kinds of music. However, there were only two things going good for this band on this cd: the song ""taste of ink"" and the lyrics. When I say lyrics, I mean the lyrics for most of the songs, not just ""taste of ink."" Anyway, The Used's lead singer is not even close to being anything good, and at times gets on my nerves. He needs to tone it down some. Some of the songs were decent, but nothing compares to ""Taste of Ink."" That song just made the cd. Buy the single if they have it out and bypass this cd. It'll save ya 5 or 6 bucks."
5,Awesome,"This Cd and Band are just simply awesome. The first time I heard The Used was when I listened to their pop-punk song ""Taste of Ink,"" I liked it even though it poppy so I bought the CD. I expected the rest of the CD to be the catchy pop punk kind of tune that their single was. I was wrong. The rest of the CD doesnt even compare with ""the taste of Ink."" I goes deeper. The blend of screaming vocals, and beautiful guitar and symphany is what got me with this CD. The way Bert McCraken blends screams with background vocals in ""Poetic Tragedy"" really shows how talented these guys are. Not only is the music and tone in this CD great but the lyrics were incredible. This band isnt just another group of angry teenagers who hate their parents for no particular reason. They show a maturity comparalbe to bands that have been playing twice as long as them. I reccomend this CD to anyone who truly wants to be moved by great music, while rocking out at the same time."
3,Box full of sharp objects? More like a box full of MTV kids,"This cd I must say, is overrated, plain and simple. I heard the Used a long time ago on some small sites where I could sample bands who weren't recognized, and I just heard nothing special. And then wow! MTV starts playing the Used, and oh gosh they're just do darned popular and cool now! I mean, Bert McCrackin (or however its spelled) is just so darned cool because he's a chainsmoking crack head. Anyway I'm more of a MUSIC reviewer, so here's my analysis- Decent. A bit soft on the screamo spectrum. It really isn't anything special. I guess basically if you want a generic band, this is for you, you gray blob of nothing."
1,Used and Abused,"I saw the Used live in Utah just after they had signed their record deal and I have to state for the record that I was not impressed. Maybe these guys appeal to someone, but I am not that person. I think of myself as a pretty open minded individual when it comes to music (I listen to a WIDE spectrum of stuff, from KORN to country), but these guys are painful to listen to. I think that someone needs to give the lead singer a hug and some throat lozenges. Heaven knows he's going to need them after screaming like he does. The only thing I can find to appreciate about them is that they know how to play their instruments well enough to be recognized by a record company. Beyond that, I have no ""use"" for them. To all of you who enjoy the record, more power to you. Maybe they sound better on disc than they do live."
1,generic music has never sounded so good,"People who listen to music for superficial reasons will adore this crap. I'm talking about people who dress a certain, and act a certain way in order to ""claim"" they listen to a type of music. I'm glad the best music out there today is unknown to these idiots."
1,If I could give this CD zero stars...I would,"The Used is a horrible band. I saw them live when they were on tour with Taking Back Sunday and blink-182. All they did was tell everyone to stick their middle fingers in the air and say ""f***you"" to the people on stage that they got to come up. The lead singer looks like someone out of a heavy metal band. He has a high pitch whiny voice that gets old and annoying quickly. The only thing that makes me puke more than this album is when the lead singer makes himself puke when he screams. Don't buy this CD. Buy Brand New, From First to Last, Matchbook Romance, etc. But don't waste your money on this lame excuse for a CD."
1,PAIN,"I didn't even need to listen to this CD.Just hearing that Box Full Of Sharp Objects song made me wretch in pain at the thought of having to listen to this whole CD.What is with that loud screaming.I also heard the Taste of Ink,and I thought it was also ridiculous.This CD is to be avoided at all costs.Peace Out."
5,fasten your seatbelts,"words can not describe the impact this band made in my lifei listen to their stuff over a friends house and instantly got hooked right in you cant go wrong with screaming metal and emo at the same time this band reminds me of nobody they are in a league of their own.the bests songs are blue and yellow,poetic tragedy and well the whole album.please i beg you to embrace this band cause their not gonna be excepted inot the mainstream we all nee a fuse of electricity and bert and the band brings it on. if you see them live then you know what i mean.peace.god bless"
4,WAY better than the second album,"This is another one of my favorite albums. It blows In Love and Death outta the water! Anyone who likes ILAD more than this, has no idea what they're talking about. And since the other guy did it, and i have some time, i'll rate the songs1. Maybe Memories - 7/102. The Taste of Ink - 6/103. Bulimic - 7/104. Say Days Ago - 5/105. Poetic Tragedy - 7/106. Buried Myself Alive - 9/107. A Box Full of Sharp Objects - 6/108. Blue and Yellow - 9/109. Greener With the Scenery - 6/1010. Noises and Kisses - 6/1011. On My Own - 8/1012. Pieces Mended - 8/10PS---Anyone who recommends Finch's ""Say Hello to Sunshine"" (the other guy below me), should never talk. That album blows--but ""What It Is to Burn"" is an excellent album"
4,This Is Some Powerfull Stuff,"Wow. This CD is so loud and powerfull. The vocals alone blow you away. I heard the used live and i thought they wouldnt be as power full as they were on the CD but they were and they kicked ass. If you ever get a chance to see them live do it. Songs like the Taste Of Ink and Poetic tragedy are really basic but the vocals add so much to the songs. good tracks are ""taste of ink"", ""poetic tragedy"", ""burried myself alive"", and ""box full of sharp objects"". There is also a secret track on this CD. After the last song you have to wait about 5 minutes and then you will here the band talking and about a minute later the song starts. But if you like bands like Taking Back Sunday you will like this CD."
4,Great Band Great Songs,"I would recommend this Cd to and fan of emo or hardcore rock. I listen to this Cd so many times I can't count them. But one thing I noticed about the CD is that all the best songs on their Cd aren't screamfests. ""Taste of Ink"", ""Buried Myself Alive"" and my personal fave ""On My own"" all have no or little screaming. If the Used want to be more popular, i think they have to stop some of the screamfest songs and then they'll be ready."
4,the used,at first i needed to get used to their type of some because i was goin' from G.C. and MXPX to the used but i have to say that this cd is one that you should buy and listen to a lot in fact it is so great i was listening and decided to write a review. i only gave it 4 stars because is a great cd but ti could have been better not to be a Simon Cowel but it could have been better well all i can say is that if you buy this record you won't regret it.
2,Not the Best,"Let me start by saying that the used are nothing new, screaming and vocalization can be found in other bands, such as In Flames and Iced Earth, and they've been doing it alot earlier. Okay, if you've seen my other reviews, they're normally not good, check out Avril's CD, and the Used by far are the best band I've rated, because I havent rated any of my favortites. But nonetheless, the USed are semi okay. All the reviews are good so I thought it would be worth buying, but my neighbor played it for me and I'm glad I didn't"
2,This album is way overrated,"I would like to say that this album is way overrated. I think its a horrible album. Something about this band, just don't sound right. There is something missing, maybe cathcy melodies. (the only song that is good is the taste of ink)If you are looking to become a punk rock/emo/screamo fan, don't buy this. Buy bands like Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, Fairweather and Unwritten Law."
2,Emo rules....forever,"The used are great, there very melodic and...heavy yay! I didnt like em at first, then I listened to ""A box full of sharp objects"", and i was like ""wow:)"". There great, except they sound like something done before. There are 2 flaws about the band: 1.the singer screams to much at the wrong places 2. the lead singer went out with Kelly Osbourne (sad, very sad). uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh great band, and EMO RULES! p.s. BUY IT !"
2,Poser screamo for mall kids,"The Used got together in Utah, recorded some music, and sent their demo to the band Goldfinger - now they are on MTV while band members are enjoying press time for getting arrested in Florida, and (until recently) corrupting Kelly Osbourne. They are a pop-culture novelty, from the same vein as Good Charlotte. This is the record industry taking trying to capitalize on a mostly underground musical movement of hardcore/emo and spoon-feeding it to you through these tools. The music is cheesy, at best, and, while I'd rather listen to this than Good Charlotte or New Found Glory, that doesn't mean that The Used have any more integrity as a band. If you want to hear music of this genre made by real bands who don't care about getting face time in magazines or on TV, go elsewhere. Check out Full Collapse by Thursday, or Too Bad You're Beautiful by From Autumn to Ashes."
2,The most overrated band of 2002,"plagiarism n 1: a piece of writing that has been copied from someone else and is presented as being your own work 2: the act of plagiarizing; taking someone's words or ideas as if they were your ownYou're probably asking yourself why I put that definition up there. Why on Earth would I do something like that?It's because this band should be paying royalties to Glassjaw, The Deftones, Saves The Day and At The Drive-In for writing all their songs for them.Just listening to the first song of this, I could tell that this was more easily digested, major label * for kids who think that they're groundbreaking and original. It sickens me that a band like this could get signed while other bands who have been working twice as hard for three times as long as them still get no recognition. Every time I see someone wearing a The Used shirt, I want to ask them what the hell they are thinking.OK, I can't say anything good about this CD. I'm just stopping now."
2,scream bark scream again,"this band sounds like the lead is choking on his vomit and smoking a joint while doing it. the only people who can stand this music for any length of time are recreational stoners who got tired of listening to rap and want to call themselves hard. yea, right, this cd is so hard. maybe I'm just cynical. I dunno. I can't find the quality in this music. I'll give them two points because at least they can get air time on major stations, which is something that rarely happens for most ""punk"" and ""metal"" bands."
1,"i hope this is the final nail in the coffin for ""emo""","god, i hate this music....somebody whines over painfully overcompressed guitars and tiny drums.....emo is just shinny clean punk rock (although this guy looks dirty, i'm sure it's all an act, he has set days when he showers each moth, rubs his clothes through a dust storm, etc) with boring, poorly contrived lyrics that sound like a twelve year old wrote them while crying into his notebook. how did a scene started in part by a punk luminary like ian mackaye evolve itself into a spreading virus that threatens to kill punk rock forever in a hail of corporate bid wars....throw this in the garbage, go buy some decent records, maybe the minutemen, fugazi, the wipers, or some other music that is actually punk and not just mindless apathetic drivel."
4,Great Band Great Songs,"I would recommend this Cd to and fan of emo or hardcore rock. I listen to this Cd so many times I can't count them. But one thing I noticed about the CD is that all the best songs on their Cd aren't screamfests. ""Taste of Ink"", ""Buried Myself Alive"" and my personal fave ""On My own"" all have no or little screaming. If the Used want to be more popular, i think they have to stop some of the screamfest songs and then they'll be ready. I would of given this genious and addictive cd 5 stars but those songs that are just screaming with little melody just makes me cringe because i know that the Used can be one of the best bands. But, theres too many good songs on this Cd to pass this one up so buy it NOW!!!!"
4,Very Good,"Whoever the 5th review down from me is, well, he doesn't know what he's talking about. Selling out is when people change there music just to suit other people, and The Used only has one CD, and they obviously have not done that since they only have one CD out. I rate this CD a 4 because during some songs they could lighten up on the screaming, but the rest makes up a very good album and is well put together. You can definetaly expect good things in upcoming albums from this band."
5,A Great CD,"This is easily one of the top albums of the year.....about 2 or 3 songs sound a little popish...nothing more than that...i would advise anyone who wants a great cd to buy this..its unreal..anyone who says this album is ""ok"" is retarded...b/c this is a GREAT album...your money would be well spent if you buy this album...you should buy it anyway"
5,"Emo, what? Pure rock and roll!","I had to pick up this CD after seeing The Used live at the KROQ Weenie Roast for the first time. They absolutely blew my mind - what a performance! Almost every song rocks, great drums, great riffs, great vocals (even the screaming really pumps me up). Bert's voice is just awesome - from the screaming to the melodies - so raw and full of life. Support this band! Go buy this CD and go see them live - you won't be disappointed!"
5,If it feels this good bein used..,"...then keep on usin' me, til you use me up. definitely one of my favorite newer bands(i haven't found a group i like this much in ages). awesome blend of music, vocals, with some appropriately placed great screams. only one or two tracks that i didn't care much for, but the other songs more than make up for them."
5,i would give 10 stars if i could,"this band is truely amazing. they have overcome so many obsticles in their lives such as drug addictions and being homeless and it makes their music that much stronger. the lyrics are amazing...""white it out like glittering wax butterflies"" is my favorite lyric of all time.and berts voice is just powerful. wether he is screaming his lungs out until he literaly pukes or melodicly singing softly...he takes my breath away.i was priviliged to see this band at the warped tour and they stole the show. it was amazing. bert is a true entertainer. he does backflips and speakerdives off into the crowd. they were by far the most entertaining band at warped tour. and the most talented.this cd is worth every penny. you will burn holes in it from listening to it so much."
4,Get Used,"I first heard of the used from a guitar magazine and decided to check out their new catagory of music, now being dubbed, SCREAMO. I bought their cd and after listening to it i was dissapointed, but like several cds, the more i listen the more i liked it 'til I was hooked on the used, they dont have alot of tuned down guitars (which can be good) but they do have some of the catchiest riffs and amazing screaming vocals. If you are a metal fan or a punk fan check out the used and some of the other up and coming screamo bands like Glassjaw and Thursday."
2,not that great,i really like all the music on here . but its just the singer's voice that gets on my nervesi love taste of ink and a few others but i cant remember 'em considering i took this cd to the pawn shop a while back...taste of ink is so catchy i listen to it over and over again. i give that song a 5. i would have given this cd a 4 or something but the guys voice bugs me THAT MUCH
1,"This isn't punk, it's crap","Why do people keep calling the Used punk? I checked them out, and I have to say, the singer's voice is whiny and annoying, the songs drag and generally suck, and the album is just plain bad. These guys are the farthest from punk it's possible to be."
1,Short review,Good songs: the ones when they don't scream (Blue and Yellow and The Taste of Ink)Bad Songs: the ones where they do (everything else)
4,One of the best new bands I've ever heard,"My girlfriend's been tallking about this band The Used for a while and I was like well let me borrow the cd"" and I did and I went and got it that day. I'd heard them on my Warped Tour cd and hadn't paid much attention to them but after hearing their full length I'm impressed. The only song I wasn't into was Maybe Memories. Blue and Yellow, Box Full Of Sharp Objects, Taste Of Ink, and On My Own are probably my faveorite tracks on here. I fully recommend them to any fan of Thursday, Finch, The Distillers, and Glassjaw."
5,one word - amazing.,"When i heard The Used for the first time, I thought it was disgusting. But after a few times more listening to them I was hooked. The whole cd is simply amazing. The whole cd is excellent, this is the only cd that I own that i never skip over any tracks when i listen to it. But my favorite tracks are bullimic, Blue and Yellow, Noises and Kisses, Peices Mended, and Buried Myself Alive. It is totally worth the money."
5,The Used is a Great Band!!!,"This album is excellent, and everyone out there needs a copy of it!!Anyone who loves groups like New Found Glory, Weezer, Green Day, will love this band!! Their single ""The Taste of Ink"" is a great song, and has excellent words. The single is motivating, and makes you want to get up off your seat and jump around. Every song on their album can wake you up, because it's filled with so much energy!!! (if you have trouble getting up in the morning, you NEED this cd!!) Most bands come out with one single, and you go out and buy the cd, and the cd isn't good. The Used isn't a band like that! I'm sure that you won't regret buying this cd!!"
3,ok cd,The Used are a decent band and this cd is ok. There are many good bands from SLC that deserve the exposure that the used got. If you want to hear a real band from Utah then check out Form of Rocket - Lumber. They are everything the Used could ever hope to be. It must be nice to be related to the guy from Goldfinger then mabey the good bands from SLC could get a fair shot.
1,The perfect name for this band.,"The Used is the perfect name for this band. Everything about them has already been used before. Here are a few of other names they could have given themselves: Originality Zilch, Deja Vu All Over Again or Broken Record. The only reason this disc gets 1 star is for the number of times I will most likely listen to it. Thank you Amazon for your recommending this disc when I purchased Zeromancer. This is the reason file sharing works, if I would have had to pay for this disc I would have been [mad]. By the way Amazon, CDNow's format was much more informative and easier to browse."
2,Oh please....,"Where to begin. I absolutely hate this band. It's one thing to completely jump on the bandwagon of this simply dirivative band, but everytime someone goes on and on about how ""original"" and ""awesome"" this band is I think, Give me a break! I liked this band in their much superior form named Glassjaw. Glassjaw is the band that should be getting your attention, NOT THE USED! Half of you out there probably only like this band because of Kelly Osborne and just want to think you are cool. Now before you all start hating me, I'm not talking to all of you. If you have never heard of any REAL emocore bands and The Used is the only one you have been forced to endure, then I suggest you dig deeper and find something with more substance. You can thank me later."
4,Pretty good.,"I can't relate to the music like some of the other reviewers, but I still think this music is very good. I'm not an emo kid, I'm not a ""cutter"" as previously mentioned by a reviewer, but I don't think the vocals are ""immature"" at all. I think the fact that they show stress and forced pitches helps to keep people in touch with the fact that these are regular people. I normally listen to bands like Journey, Foreigner, Toto, and Styx. These singers all had remarkably high voices with little to no effort required to reach those notes. It's good too, but I like being impressed with the pitch of the vocals, and with Journey and the like, it's hard to tell how high it is because there's no vocal strain. I appreciate Bert's vocals and admire them.P.S. Whoever said they are British is wrong. They're from Utah."
2,I still can't find why people think this album is so good.,"I keep reading these reviews and try to find what is so good by listining to it over and over and this is what I constantly get from it:Pop punk, with hardcore vocals. Now its not poorly done, the actuall music is pretty well done but this album lacks Origionality and emotion. I know I know, you are thinking, ""what the hell? this is the most emotional album I have heard.? Basically this is hardcore's version of Good Charloette. User friendly music that sounds good to people who are new to the genre. This is basically a pop album. It is not inspired and honest, or even slightly origional. Its about all that boring stuff you can find in any pop punk band.Rating it against other bands on the radio I guess I could give this album a pretty good rating, but its still very lacking. I suggest you check out the band Hopesfall."
3,ok for western astrology,"I bought this after reading Linda Goodman's Relationship signs. Sometimes the interpretation of the same aspect is quite different in the two books, e.g. Pluto trine Venus. This one has some stuff missing from Relationship Signs, like attraction and ascendent matching...Comparing with Linda, the writing style is not that interesting and personal...And many readers, including me, may not agree with his views on marriage and love, but it's restricted to few pages, and is not very forceful either...And after reading this, I read ""Light on Relationships"", the approach there is totally different, based on vedic astrology. And it seems much more impressive."
4,This manual gets you going quickly!,"Ukrainian as a second language for English speakers is especially difficult, because the student must learn a new phonetic system via a cyrillic alphabet. ""Colloquial Ukrainian"" starts with understanding the cyrillic phonex and teaches beginning grammar through common dialogue.Great book to begin self-instruction of the language. It would be improved if the dictionary pages included more vocabulary."
3,get a dictionary,"The author of this book has a very chatty writing style, which would go over better with me if he had done a more thorough job of glossing his material. There are too many words used in the lessons that can't be found in the glossary at the back, so either access to a native speaker or a dictionary will be necessary to avoid becoming too frustrated. That being said, the coverage of the grammar is not too bad. One major plus is the excellent treatment of Ukrainian phonics at the beginning of the book-careful practice with it will reward a beginning student with a good, authentic pronunciation- it is in fact one of the best treatments of phonics I've seen for any Slavic language."
1,Motorola RAZR belf holster,I reviewed this item once already...Lowsy customer service and product did not fit what it said it was going to fit!
5,Nice Swivel Clip,These clips work really well for me. Nice and thin and secure. So far no issues with this one. Fast Delivery.
2,"Cheap, but also not very durable","The price is certainly right on these, but the first one I used broke in less than a week. I bought several since they were so cheap, and if you need one of these I suggest you also buy more than one. (The second one, by the way, has been OK for much longer than the first lasted.)"
3,It's a clip.,"Yup, it's a phone clip holster alright. Nothing special, nothing bad... just a phone swivel belt clip holster.Sometimes when I remove the phone from the holster the little clippy prongs that hold the phone in also manage to rip the battery compartment off the back of the phone, but with careful practice I have the technique down to where that rarely happens now.I like the LCD facing out because I can clip the phone to my dash holder, and still flip it open to make calls and see who's calling..."
1,"Junk, pure and simple!","If you touch the phone while it's in the holster it doesn't merely fall out, it's ejected! Potentially expensive junk!Edited 01/01/07The item now pictured is not the one I purchased a couple of weeks ago. The current offering appears to have the necessary holding clips to prevent the phone from falling out. Someone must have gotten the message."
5,Great cd,Very good cd! My 1.5 year old nephew loves it. He espically likes the start stop song. Very good buy
3,Reviiew on We all live together by Greg&Steve.,"The songs are very good, but the quality of the sound is not good. I use it with my kindergartners, and I only was able to start using it more effectively when I bought a very fancy new sound dock. The other songs I have in my Ipod are a lot louder than the ones from this CD."
4,Wonderful psychedelic pop,"I'm a substitute teacher in Chicago, and occassionally I teach a kindergarden or pre-K class. The aide that I was working with threw this record on yesterday for a group of 4 and 5 year old children - obviously, they loved it, and danced around the room.I was impressed by the likeness that much of the record had to recent efforts by Apples In Stereo and many of the Elephant 6 Recording Company groups. For any fans of that ilk, I reccomend this twee pop collection."
2,"Watch out when buying an ""antique"" phonograph record!","This record is warped! I already have this record, but it is warped (the music being out of tune and wavy sounding) which is why I bought another. The record I ordered is of the same quality."
2,Greg & Steve We all Live together,"Fun songs to sing with your class.I pass a tamborine to the Good Morning song,great music movement songs too, my preschoolers love it!"
3,Average,Music was ok- I bought the CD for the Freeze song- which my son loves but he didn't seem to take to any of the other songs
1,Please send,I have not yet recieved this product. It has been one month. I need it for school. Please send it to me as soon as possible.
3,"Informative but limited for climbing, biking...","If one is not interested in purely religious destinations, another book might be in order.This book is concerned only with religious destinations in Tibet.Mountain climbers, trekkers, or bikers concerned perhaps with more terrestrial matters would be better served by a book with mile markers, better maps, and more information on lodging.I was in Tibet in March of 2002 climbing Mt. Nojin Kansa. I had this book; another guy had a book I won't bother to name. I constantly referred to the other book for mile markers, pass altitudes, international phone providers, etc.This book will get thee to a nunnery in short order. It will not provide the best maps or travel details."
5,Good Album,"I first heard this band when I saw the video for The Unguarded Moment. The lyrics helped me get through some hard times when I was a teenager. I have a couple of hits collections but this is the only studio album I have ever owned by The Church. I think the American version is better than the Australian version. Instead of Chrome Injury (good song), She Never Said, and Fighter Pilot - Korean War the American version had Too Fast For You, Sisters, and Tear It All Away (great song). But the ""box"" cd has all of these songs and a few videos. There is nothing flashy as far as musicianship goes, but the songs are well written with catchy guitars and good vocal melodies. One of my favorites!"
5,Simply a classic,This recording is on my desert island list (along with The Blurred Crusade). It is an absolute must for any fans of The Church.
5,Please Help me Find this CD,I listened to this cd while in Paris 3 years ago. It is just AMAZING! I made the mistake of not buying it....
4,Greatest musical,"Fantastic trip in the past, when the musical was GREAT!!! The box with the umbrella is really fine, now i can ""singing' in the rain""."
5,My kids (6 & 9) claim it's one of their most favorite movies!,"It's fun, it's quotable, it has catchy tunes, it's funny, and has great characters. Did I mention my kids love it?"
5,Spellbounding,I could not put this book down. It held my intest all the way till the end. I would recommend this book if you are in to bizarre mysteries. In fact I ordered another book by the same author.
4,"After this one, you WILL fear the dark!","Detective Jack Carter had divorced Cara Banks two years ago. Cara was an Evidence Tech for the police force, so he knew that he would be running into her from time to time. But they had managed to avoid each other, except for a nod of greeting as the passed each other in the hall. That changed when the first woman was found dead in her closet. She had died from multiple rattle snake bites. The two had to work together if there was a chance of finding the killer.With a second body came a link. Both women were members of an elite singles' club named Manny's. Cara must go undercover to find the killer. Problem was that the killer knew who they were and was not yet ready to be found.**** A wonderful detective thriller with just a touch of romance. I was engrossed from the first page! This one will put chills down your spine! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch."
2,A little disappointing,"An interesting book for people who like to know more about how Zen came to America, the people who promoted Zen and anecdotes about them, but a disappointing book for those how are looking for a real Zen story collection that gives you something to ""chew on"". According to the title of the book I expected something different."
5,Has started my journey,This CD has changed my outlook on zen. Especially it's place in the west. It goes from story to story of the Zen Monks that have taken the risk to teach to the west.
2,zen lite,"Why 108 stories? Well, read ""The Mysterious 108"" by Justin Stone in CLIMBING THE JOYOUS MOUNTAIN. Murphy's collection seems shallow and sanitized. Try 33 FINGERS by Michael Wenger for some real modern koans & HOW THE SWANS CAME TO THE LAKE for some real stories."
3,Great music - terrible sound,"Listening to this cd is a frustrating experience. You hear enough to know that the music is fantastic. Martin Williams declared that Blakey was the best drummer for Monk, and it seems he was right.But the sound is thin, the bass is inaudible, and you really dont get the most of what this music has to offer.There is no doubt that getting the RVG remastering of this session, now available, is highly recommended."
4,Blakey + Monk=A good combination,"Teaming up Monk with The Jazz Messengers was an excellent idea, and this album is a fine addition to the Blakey catalog. ""I mean you"" is a terrific tune and is almost as good as the original recording of it by Monk back in 1948 with Milt Jackson on vibes. Johnny Griffin's tenor is lyrical though forceful, and I guess Monk remembered him from this date when he had Grif with him a year later at the Five Spot. I don't particularly care for the tune ""Evidence,"" which kicks off the session, but all in all it's a very good date."
4,Outstanding,"Lord of Dunkeatheby Margaret MooreReviewer: Pamela Ackerson (author -- Home of the Braves trilogy)Once in a while I like to pick up Medieval Romances and I believe I have found another favorite author. Margaret Moore doesn't just write, she weaves a tale that draws you into the story as if you are involved in the lives of her characters. She goes beyond the reader's dreams and makes her characters real people, with real personalities that you can relate to because -- you know someone like that! You cheer when the bad guy doesn't win and the knight in shining armor prevails. I am looking forward to more medieval romances from this author."
4,okay,nice romance. I enjoyed reading it but it wasn't too deep or moving. Just a very pleasant afternoon reading. I liked her Viking book more.
2,Should've bought Ying-Yang.,The cd was just okay. I'm from Chicago and I love house music but this was kinda lame. A lot of the songs sound alike but the bass is booming! I'm a dancer and I can only use about 3 of the 12 tracks. I'm glad it didn't cost a lot.
2,meh,"English is the author's second language, and his thoughts are difficult to follow. Terminology is outdated/mistranslated, and the book is not well organized.On the other hand, i got it for 1/15 of the regular price, it was in great condition, and it got here quickly"
2,Stunning illustrations,"A rather soppy, overblown version of the tale, in which Gareth vanquishes several knights and wins the fair maiden. Gorgeous watercolor illustrations. Grades 4-7."
4,Good,"As far as Karaoke goes, this is a good product. Ordering was easy and shipping was quick. Not to mention the price was excellent."
2,don't spend the money,All the information in this publication is available on the company website. Go read it there.
4,Springs,You cant beet it for the price. Works good a little awkward sometimes in tight spot but gets the job done.
5,Making Sense of the Bible,Making Sense of the Bible has taught me how to recognize diverse kinds of literature that make up the Holy Bible.
1,my lord,"who listens to the amatuerish drek? these are some of the worst lyrics in recent memory. Here, try not to laugh as you read this excerpt from the song 'Happy':Youre the one that I want / youre a chance to take / youre a hard break/and swore youd never leave again/ your the only one/that i ever trusted/or who ever cared at all/is this how its going to be/is this how you wanted me.HA! That is so pathetic I cannot believe it! The rest of the album is just like this. Whine, whine, whine about some girl that left you.. The lead singer sounds like he's 13 and writes lyrics like he's in 4th grade. Avoid this junk."
3,Quite good,"3 1/2Like fellow one-namers Spoon and Doves, Wrens weave mildly intelligent, catchy indie rock from fairly familiar ingredients into something better then your status quo."
4,"(4 and a half stars) Stunning, beautiful record","The Wrens deserve to be on everyone's musical radar, and given a very close listen. ""She Sends Kisses"" is my favorite song on this record and everything else is great as well. This album took a very long time to be made, and it shows in the careful craftsmanship, musicianship, and beauty. Well-written songs with a nice rock edge."
4,maybe 4 and 3/4,"Never having heard Secaucus, or previously released versions of the songs on the album, I bought this album purely based on online reviews. Being a completely unbiased music fan, I think the people who don't like this album are nuts. Or possibly think the Pixies 'sold out' with Doolittle. I have since downloaded the out-of-print secaucus and the earlier versions of a couple of these songs, and this album is superior. A touch of U2/built to spill softens out the otherwise trail of dead vibe to my ears, but regardless of trying to describe it, I haven't fell for a band this hard since a buddy gave me a copy of GBV's Bee thousand. I'm hooked."
1,"great service, boring music",amazon - great service in getting me the CD. After a couple of full listens i tossed it in great disappointment - just did not hold my interest
4,New Kind of Failure,"This record was so hyped (by Christgau, the Times, and many others) that I was suspicious. It took me a few spins to get it. ""Faster Gun"" and ""13 Years"" grabbed me immediately. ""The Meadowlands"" is something you can't listen to piecemeal. They line out a certain kind of over-35 rock and roll reality that I believe people need more of. That said, I consider this a masterpiece, but I do find it hard to listen to. The sound is somewhat monochromatic but the Wrens are smart enough to add all kinds of subtle touches. You hear echoes of the Pixies and Pavement, but what they do is something all their own. There's something just grim about the record that puts me in mind of the Mekons. Materialist rock for a bygone age, I guess."
3,It's OK but...,"The original version of ""This Boy is Exhausted"", which prompted me to buy the album, Rocked so much harder. Despite the disapointment, it is a very good mellow indie album...like all of the other indie bands out there today."
4,Beautiful,"This is a great, great CD. It made me think of almost every girl that I've dumped or been dumped by."
4,Have to love Greg and Steve,"I'm a substitute teacher and I used ""the shapes"" song to review shapes with a kindergarten class. The kids loved standing up and sitting down when their shape was called. They asked me to do again and again.Also ""the disco limbo"" is good to do around the room on a rainy day. Kids had a blast!I gave it 4 stars because there aren't many other songs on this Cd that involve movement like the first two volumes."
5,Andra,"Man, I loved this book. A nuclear holocaust has made the surface of the planet uninhabitable, so the survivors have been forced to move underground. These underground communities are in an almost constant state of war with one another, and their rules are becoming more and more encroaching. In a future where everyone looks the same and art is edited, the only hope for survival is to go to the stars, and the only way to survive the stars is Andra."
3,Quite Good.,"Great read, was hocked though the whole book, but there were major letdowns... But I don't want to spoil it for you!"
3,a bit weak,"I bought this cd a long time ago, when all I knew was that Decoder & Substance were involved. I love Decoder, but this is not what I would have expected. Don't listen to all those reviewers saying ""If you like dnb, buy this...."" because this is not really drum n bass. The cd is alright, and I do listen to it, but don't buy it thinking you're going to get hard dnb, because it's real weak. The music is lacking, keeping the focus on the vocals, which aren't very strong either. I would have expected a lot more from Decoder / Substance."
4,Great Buy,"Once again, I'm not disappointed. Kosheen is always a nice change from the same old crap being played on the radio/TV."
3,Finally it arrives !!,"Kosheen re wrote the rules for Drum & Bass when they added a female vocalist and poignant lyrics to thick bass sounds.The entire Drum & Bass world has been awaiting this album but upon listening it has the great tracks we have already heard while the rest sounds like a cross between the Cranberries and Garbage (the band that is).Hide U and Slip and Slide (Suicide) stand out but be warned some of the other tracks are not all that D&B, not that that is all bad though !"
4,This is a good album.,"Amazon has asked me to review my recent purchase, so I will. This album bears many trappings of the so-called ""drum 'n' bass"" and ""trip-hop"" genres. It is, however, not as disjointed or frenetic as, for example, Squarepusher, or nearly as dark as Portishead. The songs are quite catchy and melodically astute--they are basically pop songs set to a much faster paced beat than generally gets radio play. The lyrics may be a bit dramatic for you, but if you enjoy dramatic lyrics (I do) then you will probably enjoy this album. I got it in high school and it was stolen, and since then has gone out of print, so I was most pleased to find it used and CHEAP on Amazon, and it conjured up so many memories of that time when I was one big raging hormone. If, by the way, you are one of those people who needs to get everything that has come out of Bristol then you certainly can't neglect this record, as it is one of the more accessible albums from that scene. Good day."
3,Kirby #1,"This needed to be seen before Kirby and the Toy World to know what was happening. Again, geared for the under 12 set. Lots of action, adventure, and simple video effects.This movie showed how one individual can make a difference, how to work as a team and make friends, and never give up when you are working toward a set goal.I enjoyed it."
5,Powerful music,"An absolutely beautiful album, gothic, haunting, but at the same time uplifting. ""Janitor of Lunacy"", ""The Falconer"", and ""All That is My Own"" are especially powerful. The first of these, Luncay, makes one wonder of the possible influence on Nico of being a child in the ashes of wartorn Germany. The second, The Falconer, pulls one back almost literally into the Middle Ages. The third, All That is My Own, from which the title of the album comes (""Meet me on the Desert Shore""), also harkens back to the Middle Ages, with a hint of Middle Eastern influence. ""Mutterlein"" is also a hauntingly beautiful song (in German). And then, to this, you add the uplifting and positive (despite the title) ""Afraid"". Truly, a landmark album."
2,Not exactly what I thought I was getting based on description.,1. Tools are included for calibration.2. An instruction manual is included with an image that shows a refractometer with a split measuring gravity on one side and brix on the other which would have been handy since I didn't receive the disc that LTB claims they ship alongside. You can find conversions online in a pinch.3. The case is nice and durable.4. I don't have a point of reference to tell whether the item is accurate since my calibration went fine and my brix consistently shows up lower than my specific gravity listing on my hydrometer.
2,Should've listened to the pro...,"I bought this refractometer for homebrewing beer against the recommendation of my LHBS owner, who argued they are far more handy for wine makers. Either way, I liked the idea of simply taking a few drops of fermenting/ed beer to check my gravity. Our first batch measured higher brix than we expected- we just accepted we screwed something up while brewing. Then another batch that was clearly different SG and FG came out with the same brix as the prior batch! We then tested it against our hydrometer (should have done this in the first place) and, to our surprise, got pretty significantly different results.I wish I would have listened to the pro..."
1,Terrible accuracy,"I have repeatedly calibrated this and it reads 12 brix on a 2 brix solution. Will try to return it. Did not have the CD as described in the prior reviews, but I expected that."
1,Return to Sender,"This may or may not be a very good brix meter but without the promised chart showing conversion to alcohol content, it is completely useless for wine and beer making. Contacted Amazon to obtain the chart. I was told they could not send missing parts. Returned the item for full credit so it was not a waste of money but just a waste of time."
2,guide missing and no conversion table,"Easy to use but complimentary guide was missing and there was no conversion table between brix degrees and the specific gravity. In addition, the guide has numerous misspellings and was for a different scale."
1,Sent wrong item,"Normally I wouldn't have rated this at all, because I returned the item for a refund. But the seller, sportswarehouse, keeps sending me e-mail asking me why I haven't reviewed the purchase. So here goes.This is billed as a refractometer for measuring sugar content in beer or wine. What I received was a refractometer for measuring salinity. There was no included conversion chart or anything to compensate.So, why 1 star? Not for the item, but for the seller, because they very clearly described this item as being for homebrew use and saying that it measured in deg Brix. I bought this knowing that many other people also got the wrong type of refractometer, which means that this seller either is completely incompetent, or they just don't care."
4,Good value product,"This is a great deal. Was looking at competitors for up to 8X the price. Seems, to work well. I was disappointed that was not able to have the refractometer shipped to Canada. However, had it shipped to a US address and forwarded to Canada. Thanks"
2,Missing documentation and incorrectly sold.,"The product did not arrived with the ""Free Copy of Learn To Brew: Recipe Formulation Made Easy Included"". Additionally the statement, ""No tools are needed for calibration."" was false. The product arrived with a calibration screwdriver and did require it. I really expected to get the unit that did not require the screwdriver for calibration."
2,Salinity refractometer,"May be a very fine salinity refractometer, but it will never measure sugar content. Ordered, returned, ordered again, returning again."
3,Lukewarm happy....,"Video's in good shape, shipped promptly etc. No problems there. I just didn't realize this was only 1/2 of a 2-DVD set.... Maybe I just didn't read the ad close enough."
5,The Best Depiction of Jesus I've seen!!,"If you cannot go to Israel and sit on the shores of Galilee, this is the next best thing! Word for word, the book of Matthew, this DVD is giftedly portrays Jesus by Bruce Marchiano. After watching him as Jesus, I simply couldn't read the gospels the same way! My kids even love watching it! A blessing to anyone who views it! Certainly one you'd want to have in your ""faith"" library!"
4,"Arse-kicking ""white boy"" blues!","Gritty, nasty mid-60s Brit-rock. Imagine Decca era Stones and Them involved in a full out brawl. Back Beats galore! Painfully wrenched pentatonic rave-ups. Marred only slightly by the drummer's perchant for dissappearing for days and leaving studio players to fill in. Guaranteed to completely annoy roommates if played more than once a day."
1,UG is a cheap imitation of J Krishnamurti,"After reading all of the books on J Krishnamurti, I see where UG tried unsuccessfully to imitate.Read the REAL Krisnamurti and don't bother with this 'wanna be' unless you want to, of course."
1,Nothing to do with Enlightenement.,"Belive U.G. Krishnamurti if he tells you that the process, which he also calls ""the calamity"", that happened to him has nothing to do with enlightenement. He lost his memory to the point, that he doesn' know anymore that this is a cow and that is a flower. If he sees a mango he doesn't remember how it tastes. He doesn't even have a feeling of presence of his own body. (It's the mind that looses it dominance over you as you develop spiritually , but on the other hand you regain your body very much from the inside.)It seems to me that he suffers from a medical contition. If you are a doctor or a psychiatrist this book may be enteresting to you.If you would like to find harmony and balance with yourself and the universe read other books."
3,Mail Order,"This book covers some of the basics in the mail order business. The author uses many examples from his own mail order business. He gives advice on: inexpensive publicity releases, obtaining a mailing list, zoning laws and producing or sourcing your products. This book gives hope to those who want to start a mail order business."
2,"An okay reference, but not comprehensive.","The main emphasis on this book seems to be on making money by direct mail... sending out letters for a product, posting ads in newspapers, etc. It does cover other aspects, but I am left with many questions I wish were answered."
2,Smaller sharpener not small enough,I bought this for the smaller sharpener for eyeliner pencils. Urban Decay ones. It does not sharpen them. I'll have to figure out how to get a sharpener that's narrower.
5,Zenkl is a mandolin monster,"The opening cut on this album helped win Radim Zenkl the 1992 US Natl. Mandolin Championship. This guy's playing is phenomenal. The album is a solo mandolin project, but there's plenty of variety on it since Zenkl uses other instruments from the mandolin family, and he also can sound like multiple instruments with his duo style. I really enjoy his creativity and innovation. Zenkl is special because he also has the technical skills to be able to communicate his musical creativity to us for our listening pleasure and enjoyment."
4,One of the best today,Radim is one of the true innovators on the mandolin today. If you want to hear something new try this.
1,....,"Pretty pointless single. Doesn't provide any real nice remixes, your better of just buying the full album."
3,okay for a lost p funk song,this is a pretty decent pop-funk jam cut by p funk member ron ford and released later on for serious p heads only.
3,"I use Vol. 2 more, but kids do Love it!","I am a teacher at my local Head Start program, and my students love Greg & Steve. We usually listen, dance, and sing to a song from this cd at least once a week. The ABC rock is an excellent active learning tool to teach language arts skills. We use Vol 2 much more, however!"
2,Difficult to use,"This product was difficult to maneuver and impossible to completely empty. I could only figure that it's made for using it while prone, gravity being what it is."
1,The scale only goes from 1 to 5 stars but I want to give a 0,"yeah I really don't like this CD, it wasn't at all what I was expecting. After the first listen of the cd I tried to give the cd away but no one wants it. I mean this cd is so bad my girlfriend dumped me because I own it; my friends don't talk to me any more, and my family is kicking me out of the house and changing their last name - no one wants any association with me since learning I own this cd. I even tried to give the cd away to a homeless man but he took one look at the cd and started to throw cats at me."
1,"These are wannabe's, bring back Nirvana and Chili's","I love goth, rock, punk and reggae music but this is a load of wannabe rockers trying to be cool and failing quite miserably, i hope that this music doesn't get TO popular otherwise us Goths will have to release loads of albums to get this junk of the charts."
1,This album is terrible,Yeah basically I bought this album when it came out after hearing that I predict a riot song. After listening to it I almost puked. I threw away $7 for this CD and it was the worst $7 I ever spent. Anyone who says this album is above 1 star maybe 2 is a complete moron.
4,This cd Rocks!,"if you're expecting a crappy alternative band this is not it. if you like 80's new wave then this band is for you. it's a great change from all the emo ""i love my g/f so much"" crap that we have all been hearing for the past 9 years. they're new, they're fresh, and they are a fresh alternative from the crap that has been on the radio for almost a decade."
3,"Boring, Redundant, But Entertaining","Okay, first of all, let me just say giving this album 3 out of 5 stars was a gift. For me personally it was more of a 1 out of 5 stars but I gave it a 3 because there is a definte appeal for some people.I borrowed a friend's copy of this album and was at first mildly entertained. It's catchy, fun, light, fluffy and dare I say shallow. It began to bore me very fast since this album has absolutely no substance whatsoever. It's not bad persay, just a boring watered down version of 80s new wave. People are comparing it to The Clash, Talking Heads, The Cars, and many others, while they are infleunces, unlike them there is nothing new in this album, and it's very uncreative. It's like they used the same outline as Franz Ferdinand/Modest Mouse/ The Killers to create this album.All in all, it's slightly entertaining for 'Top 20' material but that's all, this album did absolutely nothing for me."
5,Kaiser Commotion,"There are many definitions for Punk Rock music. The best definition is to combine catchy pop music with anti politcal commentary. In the time honored tradition of songs like ""Ballroom Blitz"" by The Sweet"", ""In the City"" by the Jam, and ""London Calling"" by the Clash comes ""I predict a Riot"" by the Kaiser Chiefs. working with the same exact producer who worked with Blur, the Kaiser Chiefs managed to take a poppy sixties hand-clapping, organ blasting beat ala Dave Clark Five, and combined a raw edgy attitude that would have made the late Joe Strummer very proud. I am sure that he is somewhere in heaven yelling hell yeah!"
4,"Peanut All The Way, Man","This is a very energetic album, and it is quite adequate in the rock department. The songs are well thought out, and the components of the songs are quite nice. Ricky Wilson (lead vocals)does quite a fine job with singing, and the other members of the band work together nicely. Overall, I would definately reccomend this album for some brilliant rock fun.Please accept this jumbled review as an expression of a great album!"
4,"Such divine noise, makes you wanna move yer A_S:","The Kaiser's just go ahead and kick it out of the freakin stadium. They have all of the right elements,(1)a cool name with a interesting story behind it(2) they love rock n roll and pop and they play it well (3)they are not ashamed of that fact (4) they have come to have a good time, make you move your A_s and think a little. (5)The lead singers name makes him a shoe in for either rock n roll or baseball. But luckily he chose to be a rock vocalist who sounds like its everything that he dreamed it should be. And that's all that you can ask for from a good rock album. So buy it, crank it up and count the Kaiser's in for the next new wave of clever young brit bands.Peace- The*Hot*Wax*Kid"
5,Simply amazing,"Listen to it in the morning and you will be happy for the rest of the day! The rest is irrelevant, but both musically and lyrically they are great."
5,One of the best debut albums of 2005,"With a barrage of new Britpop bands storming onto the scene on what seems like a weekly basis, it's easy for some to go unnoticed. But such is not the case with the Kaiser Chiefs, whose debut album, Employment, makes listeners sit up and take notice.Much like a lit stick of dynamite, Employment is explosive pop brilliance. From the first single 'I Predict A Riot' to its hit follow-up 'Oh My God,' the Kaiser Chiefs show that they can craft anthemic rock stompers. Elsewhere, especially in the sing-a-long 'Na Na Na Na Naa' and 'Saturday Night,' the Chiefs turn up the intensity and take it to the next level. Yet they still manage to have fun while crafting credible pop tunes, which is evident in 'Everyday I Love You Less And Less' and 'Born To Be Dancer.'Employment is easily one of the best records of 2005. Frankly, if you don't own this album then you're missing out."
4,"Fun, Catchy, and Humorous Group from Leeds","I first heard the band as a free download on iTunes. Intrigued, I listened to a few more of their songs from their Employment CD, and was hooked. The opening track starts off sounding like Donkey Kong, or some other Nintendo game, but it works well, and doesn't become overwhelming. The rock in their songs certainly comes out to play, and is great to listen to, especially while driving. The guitar riffs on some of their tracks are catchy, with the guitar's tone being downright scorching. One reviwer mentioned their name came from a football team, but I thought it was a motorbike that one of the band members owned. One of the tracks has the sound of bike firing up, and the inside CD cover attributes this to a 700 cc Kaiser 'Chief' or some such thing. But, either way, I picked this CD up at Target for $6.oo (US) and it has already paid for itself. Give 'em a go, I think you'll like what you hear.Cheers!"
4,"Good, lively band","This band has a very distinctive Euro sound, like the Clash or the Cure. It is lively and engaging and fun to bop and sing along to. Great music for a road trip, a party or getting really physical stuff done that you don't want to do--like moving, cleaning, or working outside."
3,Interesting And Listenable Background Music,"Invoking sounds reminiscent of The Smiths, XTC and Madness in a new band would normally be a great, great thing. But the Kaiser Chiefs have a bit of an over-produced, mixed electronic sound, that thankfully isn't cheesey. The songs are somewhat light and emotionally removed, but maintain an edge and include a noticeably British influence (obviously).There's some good music here, it can be creative and enjoyable, and the songs have nice lengths and can actually still sound original.I have it on my music software's favorites list and listen to it frequently now, despite it not being overly memorable at this point. It will grow on you a little, and if you like good Indie Rock, they are worth a thorough chance."
1,Kaiser Thiefs,"A shameful collection of borrowed sounds and techniques. Further, any attempt at originality falls flat. This is formula rock. An earlier review's reference to the Offsprings is appropriate: their first few albums were worth their weight in gold but later releases were purely formulaic, goofy and light-weight. Raise your standards; expect more."
3,Better than the Killers,"Certainly catchier than the Killers and more fun than Bloc Party. Probably just as overhyped as all those. Still, a fun time for all."
2,Bo-ring!,"I listened to this CD one time in the car after I bought it, never again after that, and even then, I was skipping most tracks. The first track caught my interest because the lyrics were amusing. I really wanted to like ""Caroline, Yes"" but couldn't get into it.I say, don't bother with the CD unless you've heard it first and liked it."
4,Gets better with more listens,"With the hype and over-playing of ""i predict a riot"", the Kaisers had a lot to live up to and they come close to the hype. There are some excellent melodies and mostly catchy tunes. Overall, the record is not as upbeat as ""riot"" which is as good as it gets on this release. There are some very obvious nods to Blur and Madness in their songwriting (2 tracks almost sound note for note like Madness tunes), but that isnt a bad thing. If you have to wear your influences on your sleeve, those are 2 good bands to emulate. The slower tracks grow on me the more i listen to the record and i think after about the 5+ listens i've had so far, the only song that i would skip entirely is the last song. It's too bad most of their songwriting magic went into ""i predict a riot"" but this is still better than most other ""mainstream alternative"" offerings. Recommended."
3,Good fun but a bit samey,"""Every day I love you less and less"" sets the tone for the album, and it's an interesting tone, teetering on the edge of novelty song territory but with flashes of real, confused, hurting teenage emotion. But a little of this goes a long way and the album gets a bit boring until it comes back with a stunner of a closing song, ""Caroline Yes"", a stomping waltz with an irresistible hook of ""You are everything I want to be / IN MY LIIIIIIIIFFFFFE"". Not my favourite album of the year, but great as a source of mix tape material."
4,I don't know what the problem is!,I have no idea what the other reviewer was talking about. While they aren't my favourite British band (Bloc Party has quite an edge) they are an excellent band. I saw them in Vancouver the other day and their stage presence was fantastic. The band was full of energy and gave us our money's worth (two encores). What else could you say about a band where the frontman crowd surfs while still belting out the lyrics?!
3,perfectly harmless UK pop singles,A fine throwback to Madness (but not better than Madness). What makes the CD work better than it really should is is that the band is clearly having fun and the lyrics are harmlessly fun and tunefully sung. The studio production is clean and not over-produced. Many bands out now can't sing at all and this band can actually carry a tune.
3,"Provoking and fun, not great","Good tunes? Sure I Predict a Riot, Oh My God and Everyday are high quality and the band sure sounds like they're having a lot of fun. Lyrics are at best silly word plays and teenage jokes that arent funny so much as just unique choices. What will surely let down American audiences is the album's complete devotion to all things Britpop, from Blur to even early British Invasion, this albums takes a swing at it all. I Predict A Riot's party lunacy is more the exception than the rule here and in the end the band gets too cute for its own good. A decent record and one that should still please Anglophiles everywhere. Indie kids looking for more enriching experience should go directly to Bloc Party."
3,Nothing New,"Don't expect anything new from the Kaiser Chiefs, they are just not that kind of band. The sound like all those britpop bands from the 1990s, they fit right in.That doesn't mean they are bad, there are some excellent songs on there like ""I Predict a Riot"" and ""Oh My God""If you liked all the britpop stuff from the 90s you will like this too."
3,Spotty,"I love humor in music (probably more than most), and enjoy silly for its own sake in nearly every form. Conversely, I also tend to loathe self-importance in any of the arts to the point of rejecting perfectly good bands (like early U2 and Wilco) that I then rediscover years later (after they come down from the soapbox). So you'd think I would adore Kaiser Chiefs' buoyant debut Employment, chock full as it is of peppy English rock and roll ditties not heard in these parts since the glory days of Madness. And yet. And yet there's an arch quality to many of the twelve tunes here, the result of trying too hard, showing off for the lads in the pub. Don't get me wrong - great tunes abound, especially the opening triptych of the Devo-esque ""Everyday I Love You Less and Less"", the Jam-tastic ""I Predict a Riot"", and the Blur-ish ""Modern Way"". After that, it's all over the post-music hall map of olde Blightey with varying results."
3,I don't know...,"Kaiser Chiefs are another band that I was recommended to on this site. I don't know if I agree with everyone classifying them as Brit-pop; I think they're more indie rock (but actually, I guess there really isn't much of a difference between the two terms). Anyway, while I do like a lot of indie rock, I just couldn't get into this album.People say that ""Everyday I Love You Less and Less"" starts the album off right, but I think that starts the album off weird. I also wasn't feeling ""What Did I Ever Give You"" or ""Saturday Night"". And while even negative reviewers like ""Oh My God"", that song made ME say just that.I'm not saying that the Kaiser Chiefs are a bad band, but the wordplay on this album (not necessarily the lyrics) made things just a little too hard to get into. They're popular enough, though, so I doubt Employment will put them out of business, but as far as indie rock goes, I think I'll just stick with my Franz Ferdinand and Modest Mouse.Anthony Rupert"
2,over-rated,"I Predict a Riot is an ok single, I guess, but you can detect many influences from the 70s and 80s in there, even some Adam and the Ants! As an album I fail to see how they get rated so highly in the UK press, it's been a slow year I guess and they need something to shout about. The Kaisers are kinda fun but they're also kinda a pants rehash of yesteryear. I hope 2006 gives us something more substantial to get our teeth into..."
2,Britpop needs to be revived (not a revival),"I love Britpop. It's obvious the Kaiser Chiefs love it too. The problem is all of this has been done before. Why waste your cash on copycats when the originals still live in cd bins a few feet away (or just a click away on the internet). I Predict a Riot is a great song. The Jam and The Clash have dozens of better songs in their catalog. Blur and The Kinks don't need to be cloned for generation x, y and zzzz (this is putting me to sleep)... For original pop music go to the great white north and check out The New Pornographers, Arcade Fire, Stars, Broken Social Scene etc... As for the U.K., somewhere in a yard an amateur band is playing and you can guess the rest."
2,over-rated but still cool in a retro fashion,"kaiser chiefs the cockney sparrows of england the place i hate to live, but anyway this band exploded onto the english black market and make a statement with their first single ""oh my god"" which bombed at 39 when it was first released then the kaiser chiefs went and made a video re-released it and they got a top ten hit..with it's catchy ""oh my god i can't believe i've never been this far away from home"" even i was humming it..then came "" i predict a riot"" snother catchy pop tune going back to the awful bands of britpop i/e blur oasis supergrassbut this has a fresh sound better than any of the band mentioned above,""everyday i love you less and less"" great video good songwith the usual ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh thrown into the middle because it's trate of the chiefsthen the recent single and the best song they've down""the modern way"" a great song by a vasely over-rated britpop band"
4,The Next Big Euro-Thing,"And how many times do we hear about the 'next big thing' happening overseas? This is another band I had to follow the hype on and see what they were about. This is a very fun disc. Very catchy songs, and a great sense of humor about them. Imagine 'The Jam', some synth pop, and any combination of the current 'The' bands in the world. This might not be the album you'll be listening to 10 years from now with the same fervent passion, but for now...it rocks just fine!"
2,Oh My God (I can't believe it!),"This band, like Interpol, was cool to me at first, a British indie-rock style with a few catchy songs. However after buying this CD I haven't listened to it more than a couple of times. Some of the songs are downright annoying and stupid, while the rest have repetitive lyrics and seem to be trying to copy British 60's pop music. A few of the songs are OK, including ""Modern Way"", but it's a very forgettable album and I see this band forgotten in ten years or so. Buy a Blur album instead."
3,More filler than killer,"A couple of songs are well known and great fun, but there isn't a lot of creativity here."
4,Look for one's self before judging...,"I respect the previous reviewer's dislike of the Kaiser Cheifs, but I kindly suggest that he or she actually go to a Kaiser Chiefs concert before judging the band to have the ""charisma of a tortoise.""Fresh off the Kaiser Cheifs' performance last night at LA's Avalon, I can safely say that they're one of the most electrifying live bands around today. Ricky Wilson lit up the stage with obnoxious dancing that created the very riot in the audience he predicted. Each track on their CD is subtley unique, simultaneously sardonic and genuine.Granted, the Kaiser Chief's isn't for everybody. But patient listeners will be rewarded. Personally, it did take some time for me to appreciate the simple genius behind this band's common pop-rock facade."
3,A Better Boyband,"They're five people in a band put together by Lou Pearlman. They look good, they dance well, and they sing fairly well too. Songs that stand out are ""I Give"", ""Never Had It So Good"", and ""Please Stay"", the ballad that could really melt girls' hearts. Bad points about this cd is 1. they're a boyband. 2. they're just singers than musicians. 3. their album is like other boyband albums with a little edge. Recommended to tweenagers, and not recommended to people who like to analyse music more than they listen to it.Have fun."
2,poorly matched set,"I had these on my wish list and they were given to me as a gift. They are obviously hand made, though they are poorly matched: the heads are different sizes and shapes, and the finger holes are different as well. One ""grabs"" where the front bit curves back toward your finger, while the other works smoothly. In fact- the only way they match each other at all is in length!This was my first set of Santoor hammers and I had hopes for experimenting with the sounds and control options that it might have offered. I must say, I am disappointed."
5,Increased horsepower as advertised,The installation plans were clear and concise. The installation went smoothly with no hitches. The installation time was appriximately 1.5 hours at a comfortable pace. The 2001 Jeep Wrangler - 4.0 L had noticeable improved performance after the install.
4,Not for 2.4L engine,This Item is not for the 2.4L engine Amazon needs to add engine tab on anything that fits any vehicle.I checked it out before ordering so I didn't make this mistake. I did on a few things before and learned to check things out at the manufacture site before ordering.
4,An adorable old fashioned book for girls,"I borrowed a decrepit version of this book from our library before I started a hunt to buy it. Before there was I Spy there were books like this hiding surprises in their pictures.Heartwarming and traditional (mom, dad, brother, sister, pets) it has lots of flaps and ""paper"" people and props to place on the pages but they do slide all over, without the modernity of velcro!"
4,like scooby doo for younger kids,"Archie's Weird Mysteries is sort of a mix between Harvey comics' ""Archie"" and Scooby Doo with Archie and the gang getting by with all sorts of odd paranormal things happening, like students turning invisible, werewolves reported on lover's lanes, strange shops selling odd items etc.They are fun but typical of Harvey products I'd say this is aimed at a slightly younger audience than was Scooby Doo because each mystery has a moralistic lesson packed in, like don't be greedy/keep your promises/to be obsessed etc. Realizing this lesson doesn't solve the mystery but it does tell the teen responsible ""look what happened because of X"" and this gets just a little trite after a while.Over all this is good fun at a low cost, if you like paranormal cartoons and is particularly smaller for younger kids you don't want to be too creeped out."
5,Good Times.,Good to see a old show like Archie's and his friends solving mysteries well their still don't believe his stories are real.
5,great underated show,i waited for this on dvd for awhile the price was great they need to release The Archie/Sabrina comedy hour Hopefully millcreek has plans to buy the rights and release it soon
4,Best Archie Series,"This is the show that got me into Archie in the first place, and it is still as wonderful as I remember. My only wish is that there had been behind the scenes bonus features."
4,Solid fun!!,I picked this up for the grand kids and was surprised by how quickly they were hooked by it. The stories are in the vein of Scooby Do but tailored for the Archie bunch with a slight message thrown in every episode. They do not leave the kids 6 to 11 scared or bored. So in the long run for the price a great deal.
2,So far one episode not playing correctly,"We've watched about ten of the episodes, and so far one is not working properly. Is it harsh to be giving it only two stars based on that? I don't think so. I paid for forty episodes and expect to watch 40 full episodes. The problem episode skips and freezes for the first 6 to 8 minutes. I'll update this review if I find more not playing right."
2,disapointed,this is a fantastic cartoon...BUT...the last few episodes on each disc refused to play...or would be pixilated. it was a disapiontment to have some of the cartoons stop in the middle of a show. Maybe i got a bad disc...i dont know...but aaarrrggg
1,"Yikes, what a joke...","What the hell happened to these guys? I have not bothered to see the Stones since about 81, and watched this out of curiosity. Everyone says they're ""better than ever"", but... What's with all that junk all over the stage? Why do they need 3 keyboard players and a 5-piece horn section? Why do they need huge inflatable things, 10,000 spinning lights, and flashy pyrotechnics? It all makes the Stones themselves seem utterly ridiculous and unimportant, as if their music alone is not enough entertainment. No wonder their tickets are so expensive.KR and CW are a great rhythm section, and they should not need ANY of that unimaginitive, hi-tech slick show-biz crap to pull off their tunes live. Why Stones ""fans"" eat this BS up is beyond me.Watch Gimmie Shelter or C***s****r Blues or the TAMI Show for the Stones live without - not this silly Hollywood crap."
3,bad sound,"What happened to the sound quality? I originally saw the Stones' Live at the Max at an IMAX theater in Vancouver, Canada, and it sounded incredible. The sound literally blew my away. But the sound quality in this DVD is simply mute in comparison. I consider the Stones' Gimme Shelter DVD the greatest rock film ever made (followed closely by Pink Floyd's Live at Pompei and The Wall). Unfortunately, Floyd's Live at Pompei isn't on DVD, and the Stones' Live at the Imax is (it should have been left on VHS, or at least digitally remastered for DVD)."
2,"Love Hurts, I love the Stones, but I can't recommend this.","While the visuals on this DVD make me feel like I was there, and I wanted to be excited about this DVD, the sound of each and every song gradually killed my excitement. The sound is terrible, it is biased so much to the music, when the sound from the crowd comes in, its like somebody in the editing studio simply turned up the volume on the crowd track. Very low rent. Worse, the Stones were never known for their live music skills, so the 95% bias to their music leaves all the warts out in the open, with no Stones Live (from the crowd) atmosphere.I went to this concert, and it was so so so much better in person, I must give the sound crew an F on the DVD, it does not capture the audio side of the experience, while the video side is covered excellent."
5,THE STONES TAKE YOU ON A TRIP INTO NEVER ENDING PLEASURE,THIS VIDEO SIMPLY ADDS TO THE OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAVE EVOLVED FROM A ROCK & ROLL (BLUES) BAND TO DEFINE WHAT ROCK & ROLL (WRAPPED WITH A RIPPING BLUES UNDERCURRENT)IS. THEY HAVE PASSED THE POINT OF BEING A BAND TO BECOMING THE TRUE ESSENCE OF ROCK & ROLL BY CREATING A SOUND SO PROFOUND AND UNIQUE THAT IT LEAVES ONE SPEECHLESS AND TOTALLY AWE STRUCK. AFTER ALMOST 40 YEARS I STILL CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THEIR MUSIC-EVEN AFTER GROWING UP IN THE 60'S WITH THAT GREAT WATERSHED OF TALENT. THIS IS A MUST BUY DVD; ENJOY!
2,horrible sound -,what's with the sound on this dvd. The audience noise is louder than the Stones. The musical quality is compared to an old record which has been ran over by a truck. The crowd's screaming and yelling drowns out 85% of the music.This concert video is the best argument why stadium concerts are not made for music.
3,"Great, but lyrics are muddy","I have recently bought a new entertainment system, and I must say that I was disappointed with the sound of this disc. The visuals are spectacular, but compared to other music dvds I have, the sound on this one is sub par. Upon first viewing the disc, I was worried I had blown a speaker, but I have tested out the other dvds in my collection and they still sound fine. My recommendation would be to buy B2B instead...I am planning on buying that one next."
2,Too many overdubs...,I saw this in an IMax theater last year and was horrified to see that almost all of the guitar work is overdubbed. Keith's fingerwork doesn't match what is coming out of the speakers at all. You'd think they could actually play the tunes live by now. Quite the embarrassment. I'd rather hear a few bum notes than this dishonest mess.
4,Blu Ray Concert Essental,First off I'll admit I'm a huge fan of the Stones and I saw this tour in person.Second I love IMAX films they are pinnacle of visual quality. When I saw thiswas out on Blu I took the plunge and I'm glad I did!Visually this is as good as concert film gets great PQ and looks awesome on my large 50 inch LCD.Audio is impressive as well really the only downside is this lack of substantial extra features.Still if quality is what you are after this is a great concert Blu-ray to show off your setup and the next best thing to IMAX or being there!
3,egg beater,I didn't find this in any store. So I was glad to find it on Amazon.com. Reasonable price too. But its blades were a bit longer in the length than I expected. But over all I was satisfied with the prompt delivery and the product.
1,Ten Minutes of Torture,"HIC Harold Imports Egg Beater Deluxe ChromeWhen I first turned the handle the spokes of the eggbeater, they seemed to be struck. I straighten the spokes out then it seemed to work. Two weeks went by before I tried to whip some whipped cream. After ten minutes my arms were aching but the whipping cream was still liquid. Do yourself a favor buy an electric mixer, fast and easy."
5,Super vegetable recipes!!,"I have probably cooked 50 recipes from this book, and everything turns out great! What a broad variety of dishes. This is the book I go to when a find some fresh or interesting vegetables at the store, and need some wonderful way to cook them..This book makes me want to go cook some wonderful vegetables, and read some of Bert Green's introductory comments!!!"
5,A fantastic book i have used for 20 years.,"I received this cookbook 20 years ago for a wedding present. I love it! Each vegetable is talked about as to what to look for in buying, what its historical uses have been(either worldwide or in his family), and what the author's favorite way of cooking it is. The recipes that follow are gleaned from many different sources. Not low fat, but high taste. I was given some fennel last year and had no clue what to do with it. Got out Greene on Greens and made some fabulous fennel bread."
4,A pleasant quick read,"I really enjoyed reading the Dolan sisters' book. I have only listened to their radio show half a dozen times, so I found the insight into their personal lives very helpful to understanding the show---also, quite hilarious! Not really a ""guideline"" book, which is what I thought it would be. Just a pleasant read."
2,Listen to the show,"I'm told the radio show is better, and I believe it. This is the story of the Dolan sisters and their somewhat unbelievable childhood growing up in a family of 10. As the oldest of seven, I can say that I found the story sugar-coated---note that the parents are largely absent, which probably wasn't the case but that's how it feels when you're part of a crowd. The ""carry your skis"" section certainly rang true, as is the assertion that in a large family one learns one is not the center of the universe. But the book is pretty superficial and a little too cute for my taste."
5,I'm a Satellite Sister,"I love this book and I love the Satellite Sisters. Reading thier book takes me back to my own childhood, growing up in a big family with my sisters. I'm sending a copy to each of my sisters. We're all getting together for Thanksgiving and I'm sure UnCommon Senses will be the talk of the table. Thank you Dolan Sisters."
2,Only contains first edition,"This book only contains the text of the first edition (which lacks several chapters of the second edition), and comes naked without any ediotrial comments."
2,Beware,Beware that this edition does not provide the standard pagination of the Academy edition. So it may not be that useful for professional philosophers.
3,Pilot purple pensw,I purchased this for a friend and she loved it. She loves the color of purple and uses purple pens.
2,"A Watered Down ""Heathers"" for the 90's.","""Jawbreaker"" is a Title, a Title looking for a Premise. It may have found a Premise, but someone should have been looking for a Script, cause this film could have used one. I had Heard the Excruciating Reviews, so I waited for video, I wasn't expecting much, so I wasn't really dissapointed, but still, it's not a great movie, it's barely a good one.The Three Stars, Rose McGowan, Rebecca Gayheart and Julie Benz are all Great Looking, Funny, Charismatic young Actresses. It's a Shame they have to Spew such Lame Dialogue. McGowan is lucky enough to get a Few good Zingers in, but they're too few and far between.Pam Grier has an amusing extended cameo as the Hard Nosed Detective who see's that something ain't right, and the Cameo by Marilyn Manson is Subtle but Effective and ultimately Vital."
1,stunk,this movie should have flopped. i expected funnieness in it and i did get some unintentiontal laughs at rose mc gowan. dont watch this its absolutley horrid.
3,I Got Candy,"Three girls playing a prank on their best friend for her Birthday realize they killed her (by gagging with a jawbreaker and locking her in their car trunk) and have to adopt a wallflower into their elite when their effort to cover it up fails. As the Prom draws near, the flawless four go into separations and their new investment stabs them in the back. Hilariously entertaining comedy, with all the right touches of sick Marilyn Manson style horror and some of the best quotes in film history come from SCREAM star McGowen. A must-see."
1,this stinks. it's that simple,"c'mon. if you want to see a flick that deals with cliques, and high school pranks and splintered friendships, then see the classic ""Heathers"". this movie tries so desperately to be something it's not. the script is horrible...the direction is horrible...the movie is horrible. get ""heathers"" and see what this movie wanted to be yet ended up falling flat on its face."
4,jawbreaker,"Jawbreaker-Rose Mcgowan, Julie Benz.Not much original ground but worth it for Rose Mcgowan fans.It extends the evil high school temptress theme beyond Rose's surprising Devil in the Flesh.Devil in the FleshThese two companion films are not of the gore variety Rose recently starred in. They would rate in the PG-13 area at most. The soundtrack for Jawbreaker is a good sampling of teenbeat featuring the Donnas.Nor are they at all romantic. Neither film has any kind of healthy love interest for Rose; and the romance between the couple who team up to stop Rose is a very offhand device without chemistry.For me, these are curiosities of interest based on Rose's role in Charmed. These are more fun than anything from the other Charmed witches except Kaley Cuoco's comedy hit Big Bang Theory."
5,"Best for your ""Guilty Pleasures"" list!","I have to agree with most, it definitely isn't your intellectual, ""change the world"", Oscar-worthy film but who cares? It's just sheer fun! Total guilty pleasure! Since the first time I've seen this movie, I never miss the chance to see it whenever it passes on cable.It saddens me that other reviewers failed to mention Jeff Conaway and PJ Soles appearance(even if PJ's is very small, still worth mentioning though!) Bottom line: Hilarious! LOVE this movie."
1,Don't even think about it.,"I made the mistake of buying this incredibly bad movie right here at Amazon, and I'd like to tell everyone not to do the same thing. Everything is wrong here, girls change constantly from being quite evil to being saints; I can buy Rose McGowan, she is evil and stays that way (although her performance is basically one-note). But Gayheart's part is a joke. Why did she hang out with McGowan when she has such a good heart in the first place? This just doesn't add up. Certainly, ""Heathers"" it isn't, no way! There is a commentary track on the DVD and obviously the director had fun making the movie. Unfortunately, the viewing experience is painful."
4,"Think ""Heathers"" for the 1990's...","If you enjoyed the movie Heathers, you will no doubt love Jawbreaker. In fact, a friend of mine who's all-time favorite movie is Heathers, almost refused to watch it. I told him it was similar to Heathers and if he hated it that much he could punch me when it was over. Well, he loved it too, and I'm talking about one of the most stubborn people I've ever met in my entire life. A dark comedy that focuses on the clique mentality. Jawbreaker is peachy keen in every possible way. Check it out...it won't disappoint!"
2,morbid,This is a morbid comedy about a gang of girlfriends who do a prank that goes totally wrong. Jawbreaker in the mouth and the girl ends up dying. Girls feel guilty. Can they get away with the crime ? You'll see. Sounds good but really it isn't.
2,A total whatever teen comedy related to HEATHERS!,"Rose McGowan stars as Courtney Shayne, the most popular and beautiful teenager in high school along with Julie Benz, Marcy ""Foxy"" Fox who is Shayne's posse, and also Julie (Rebecca Gayheart), the leggy one, and of course Liz Perr who loses her life and is the main plot in this hot teen flick about betrayl and popularity! A prank brings the whole school to tears after a school queen is killed on her birthday accidentally swallowing a jawbreaker and now her girlfriends must cover it."
3,"Good, but not great","A well executed movie, lots of clever dialog, good cinematography and excellent use of music. The story is arbitrary, but that is irrelevant."
1,Stop making it out to be something it's not.,"This is not a deep, well planned, sophisticated movie. It's boring, predictable, and the acting is terrible.There were a few small attempts to be at least humorous, but definately save your money and your time."
1,That viewer from Housten Texas was right,"This movie is, without a doubt, the WORST movie I have ever seen. I was scrolling around, to see if anyone gave it 1 star... and..... 1 person did? Damn. The only reason I saw it, is because my cousin wanted to see it."
1,Heathers want to be,This is a cheap immitation of the excellent 80s dark comedy Heathers. The script was completely stale. This movie fails miserbly on every front.
1,God Awful,"This is quite possible the worst movie I have ever seen. I can not believe I am admitting to have sat through it. It clearly tried to be Heathers but it doesn't even come close. The plot is ridiculous, the story goes nowhere,there aren't any likable character, all of the characters are undeveloped, many parts of the story line just don't make any sense, it's annoying, disturbing and bad. Usually I like annoying, disturbing and bad, but this wasn't good."
2,WOW,"Boy this movie was weird and psycho. I happen to like the weird movies but it was WAY off the psycho side for me. Friends try to cover up an ""accidental death"" from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong. Things like this, I try to stay away from. Although I am glad I saw it so I won't always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not. Now I know. I gave it 2 stars because the movie DID have it's charms."
4,Don't even think about the negetive reviews on this page,"We all know the plot. We've heard it a zillion times over before. But, this is undeniably a GREAT film. This film doesn't have humor, I admit it. But, what this film does have is depth, style, and an irrestibly charming and campy appeal. The cast delivers the full range of tones for their characters (McGowen is fiendishly exceptional/Benz is remarkably versatile) and the visual screen effects (while nothing new) are a cut above most other films using the method today. I recommend this film for anyone who likes a good movie, but I automatically count parents out."
1,Bitchy Movie,"A movie about three witches putting a ""Jawbreaker"" into their friend's mouth while she's asleep and accidentally killing her. Original! Yeah, right. This is Rose McGowan's kind of movie. ... I wish Pam Grier pulled a ""Foxy Brown"" on all of these 'girls' rears. Not funny, not cool. For the mindless folk only."
1,what are yall smoking,possibly the worst movie ever. dumb plot. mediocre acting. not funny or scary seen it all before in a better movie.
1,jawbreaker,Jawbreakeri thought that this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen i actually purchased this movie without ever seeing it once i viewed it i threw it in the garbage
5,The Best Movie!! A Must See!!,"This movie is the best movie I have ever seen! It's one of those movies you can watch 100 times and still love it! Even though it was sad what happened to Liz Purr the most popular girl at Reagan High, It was GREAT! I could keep write this reveiw and tell you how great this movie was, but I fix'n to sum it up. It was good! Go rent it and I promise, You'll LOVE it! Go rent it today. Don't forget the name,Jawbreaker!! :-)"
1,Zero stars!,"One of the stupidest movies ever, warped story, terrible acting. Heck, i got something right here for her to choke on"
3,rebecca gayheart in jawbreaker,I would suggest this movie for rent and not for purchase unless you are a fan of rebecca gayheart or rose mcgowan. This was just another teenie-bopper flick that didn't have anything that i could remember.
3,If you want to waste 2 hours see this movie!,Okay the previews are better than the movie it's self. I mean the only good part was the sex sceen with Marilyn Manson. I really thought that they ripped off HEATHERS. I really like Rose but that was it. I think that was a waste of my life and my money.
2,Unoriginal And For The Most Part Bland,"This movie reminds me of the film that came out around ten years age called Heathers, only Jawbreaker isn't as good. This movie is quite prosaic and unoriginal. There's nothing new or surprising. The acting is fine, and the plot is okay, but that doesn't always add up to make a great film. Not recommended. Forgettable and predictable. Watch Heathers instead."
2,definitely nowhere near Heathers,"I think I missed something in this movie. I think it was laughter. I think I chuckled three times. That's it. I can't believe it's actually compared to Heathers. The only 2 good things about Jawbreaker were looking at Rose McGowan, and The Donnas! Skip this ""comedy?""....."
1,the most painful 40 minutes of my life,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The first time I ever walked out of a theater was during this .... I kept thinking-""this can't get any worse and then watched in horror as it did."" The script and the acting seemed to be in a competition as to who could do a poorer job. It looked like it was put together on a twenty dollar budget. Plus the jawbreaker was the size of a baby's head. If you buy this movie you will regret it,... Never tell anyone you own it."
2,Lame High School Dark Comedy,"This flick is strictly dullsville. Unappealing characters and boring and derivative plot. You know you're in trouble when you constantly look at your watch during an 87 minute movie. Sole redeeming point is a performance by the Donnas, an all girl rock band from the Nineties, at the senior prom. ""Heathers"" covered similar territory ten years earlier to better effect. It would behoove you to check that film out along with ""Mean Girls"" instead of this dog."
5,Yum,Best movie ever!!! The reality of high school is so legit. This film is a classic and such a chick flick
5,top favorite mean girl movie,"My favorite mean girl movie along with Heathers. Even if they look like their too old to be in highschool, I've always been a fan of Rose McGowan. Its also quite hilarious, colorful and stylish."
4,This is no Heathers...BUT....it's f'n peachy keen,"Let's just get it out on the table here...no one can re-make or mimic Heathers. Heathers is the original black comedy teen angst bs movie. Heathers is the queen bee of teen cruelty movies. I own both of these movies, Heathers and Jawbreaker,carrie etc...Im a sucker for these kinds of movies lol but anyways ! Alot of people already explained the plot of Jawbreaker so we'll just skip that...but while the movie isn't brillant, it's pretty good. I was laughing, found a new catch phrase to use, and I thought Rose was awesome as the Evil B!tch...she alone is reason enough to rent or buy this dvd, she just seduces you in with her evilness (and the lipstick she wears, can't avoid those bright lips) and coolness about her evilness as if, nothings wrong, it's all f'n Peachy Keen. And that's what this movie is...F'n peachy keen...not F'n awesome (like heathers) but f'n peachy keen."
1,Stupid ! Stupid ! Stupid !,"I can't believe how very stupid this movie is. The plot was bizzare as heck, the acting was awful. Well at least the chicks were hot, but unless you are 12 that won't matter. Don't waste your time"
1,Terrible shallow movie,I can't see how anyone can like this movie. It tries to be clever and sadistic(like Cruel Intentions) but it just sounds stupid and shallow. The actresses who play these high schoolers are closer to 30 than 17. The ending where Rose McGowan's character gets what's coming to her (again-like Cruel Intentions) just makes you laugh. Rent this movie if you haven't seen it. Don't waste you're money on buying it.
4,"Not quite purrfect, but close","This is one of those movies that you think to yourself - ""This wacked out stuff could entirely happen."" Because honestly, this wacked out stuff could entirely happen.Where this movie misses is that when they are going for the serious, they are really kinda funny. However, when they are going for the funny, they end up just kind of lame. And honestly, the whole Fern/Violette subtext...waaay to over the top. They could have simply bribed her by putting her in the spotlight, not redirecting the spotlight toward her and then marveling at the monster that they created.Great cameo from Marilyn Manson as the greaser in the bar. And the Donna's playing the prom...I went to see them in concert and they are almost worth picking up this movie all on their own!"
2,Casual Canine Pink Polo,"I love this maker. Casual Canine has really high quality polos for dogs. I have purchased several of their polos online and at boutiques. They are typically cheaper online at around $13-15.00. You can pay as much as $25 in speciality boutiques. They are thick, colorful, and sturdy. They wash well and retain their color--little to no fading. However, I recently ordered the chateau pink polo and it does not quite measure up to their normal standards of quality. The pink is muted and unappealing. It does not look at all as pictured. I have this polo in neon green, grass green, royal blue, basic blue, and purple. I am returning this color because it is not very attractive."
3,It's okay,It see stat I must type in the required number of words to make a review. Don't know why it's necessary to use so many words to say its okay
2,"Good plot, dull lifeless characters, poor execution","2 of 5 stars for the action-adventure movie Sharpshooter. Sigh, I had high expectations for this movie based on the trailer and the opening scenes. In the opening, a former CIA hitman is doing a hostage rescue from two high speed cars rolling thru a desert somewhere in the middle-east. Starting with only a high-power rifle, he starts the ambush. A very impressive setup and execution. From there it all went wrong. The hitman character is toally flat and 2-dimensional. Trying to achieve a rigid army-like character, the actor achieves a total boring, don't care, uninteresting character. Our hitman is talked into taking one more job before he retires. As he starts to plan the hit we get the feeling all is not right. Yep, after he hits the target, ""they"" will hit him. Frankly, the action ain't so good; the characters are bland and don't care. For a movie with potential, this turned out badly. Don't waste your time."
4,Sharpshooter DVD Review,The Sharpshooter movie was enjoyable top watch. It had a good plot and some action.
5,Romantic movie to be rewatched over & over again,"Rewatched this movie yet again last weekend (and umpteenth times since its debut in 1993) but continue to marvel at the poignancy and cathartic experience of it all. It is certainly not one of those predictable types with the usual 'happily ever after' Hollywoodesque ending snapped on at the end to lure romantics far and wide (in that, I include the likes of Sleepless in Seattle, You've Got Mail, Wedding Planner, Maid in Manhattan,...I'm sure you get my point).For those of you who have yet to peruse this romantic period piece - I won't spoil it by revealing the ending here - just remember to have your tissues ready at hand - Jodie Foster's and Richard Gere's manifestation of love were so believably moving that I still have problems holding back my tears from repeated viewing....Though without the inclusion of any bonus materials (the studios may consider releasing a special edition perhaps?), the DVD is a must-have for collectors of romantic movies."
1,great movie - terrible copy,Love this movie but the copy we received was terrible. Picture was blurry and colors very muted....if it wasn't so cheap I would send it back. I've bought other dvd's at this price and the picture was always clear and crisp...not this one.
1,Had real possibilites,"This movie could have been so wonderful. But instead of making one smile and feel good, they ended it just like all else in this world seems to be ended. If you are looking for a happy ending...do not watch this movie. If you just want to believe in a legacy... at the cost of martyrdom... then watch it. Acting was wonderful though."
4,"Entertaining, not quite believable.","I've seen this 2 or 3 times; it is far more entertaining than most films out of Hollywood. Foster was brilliant as usual.Richard Gere is not that bad. However, in all his films, he seems to use the same mannerisms and way of strutting/walking that could be identified easily without ever seeing his face.It did not seem believable that everyone in town is fooled. Also, it seems that the change of 'yellow Lawrence' into a great and brave guy is hard to believe without any explanation such as a religious conversion. His progressive attitude on race relations seems to be a Hollywood invention rather than something a Tennessee confederate would display."
5,One Great Movie for My Home Collection!!!,"I have been looking for this movie for a while and, I couldn't remember the ending...what a great movie for my home collection! I won't give the ending away! Enjoy!!!"
1,Slumbersby,"From the creaky opening scenes to the final crash of Gere's wooden acting this film takes the biscuit for tedium. Rumoured that Foster only accepted the film after more lucrative contracts fell through, it remains a pale travesty of the original French film. A weak attempt to make the film palatable for US audiences goes totally against the original medieval European story that has been unsuccessfully updated to the period of the American Civil War. The deception that was just barely believable when set at the time of the Hundred Years' War, where it could play off the superstition that a man might be transformed by war becomes totally unbeleivable in its present version. My advice - paint some walls and watch 'em dry."
4,"COMPELLING, ROMANTIC","Yes, yes, yes, The Return of Martin Guerre is richer, more textured, more...believable. But what is up with the criticism of this beautiful commercial Hollywood-ized version? The characters portrayed by Jodie Foster and Richard Gere, as - perhaps - strangers, or -- husband and wife -- circa Civil War era has the gloss and emotion of a four-hankie 40s melodrama. The performances of all of the players are superb, and the tense, romantic, suspensful build-up to the truthful revelations, which include salvation and love, is handled with taste and beauty. The musical score provides one of those old-fashioned, almost bombastic themes that signals heartbreak, and there are many of them in this movie. If you love to cry at the movies, you will love this film."
5,Sommersby,"What an intriging film & superb actors. Two of my favorite. Keeps you in suspense & the final closing, kind of not what you expected or wanted to view, because of the fine actors in this film."
5,Sommersby with Richard Gere & Jodie Foster,"One of my very favorite romance movies that left me guessing ""is he or isn't he her husband"" until the very end!"
1,Being a resident of Chicago ...,"Being a resident of Chicago for the last twenty-five years, I can tell you that these men did work hard to get there wonderful physiques...."
3,Playing Favorites,"I bought this CD for the Brown Bear Lullaby. I also love the silliness of the song Put your finger in the air. ""Put your finger on your shoe and leave it a year or two"""
3,Pretty Things - 'Emotions' (Snapper),"Originally released in 1967, this was Pretty Thing's third effort from what I could tell. Not as good as their other earlier titles like 'Get The Picture', 'S.F. Sorrow' or 'Parachute' but it's still decent. Main reason this lp is considered a failure is that most of the song arrangements are simply too elaborate {at least, for what they're doing}. Tunes I thought made this CD somewhat of a keeper are ""Children"", the snazzy ""There Will Never Be Another Day"", the hip ""Out In The Night"", both versions of ""Photographer"", the so-so ""Bright Lights Of The City"", the happening ""Tripping"" and the stellar ""My Time"" {possibly the best track of the entire CD}. Honestly, this disc should grow on you. Plus, you get seven bonus cuts. Maybe a bit more R&B that I expected, but 'Emotions' has maybe three bad songs in it's entirety. The bonus tracks help. Check it out."
3,A Fine Album Vandalized,"I will honestly admit that the Pretty Things' pre-psychedelic era is my favorite but this first album by the former Fenmen backing Phil May and Dick Taylor is actually a really good record if you ignore the record company butchery. Listen to tracks like ""There Will Never Be Another Day"" while mentally erasing the horns and what you have are great examples of transitional ""freakbeat/psychedelia."" Even a fully psychedelic opus like ""My Time"" on which the horns should fit is fouled up by the fact that they are mixed in at twice the volume as the band itself.If the original master tapes for this album are still available, my plea to somebody in the U.K. is ""please restore this record to what the Pretties intended."""
2,A bit bland,"The Pretty Things was one of the many British bands floating around in the mid sixties making a name for themselves as part of the the zeitgeist. This, the band's third album, is supposedly marred by an outside producer's unwarranted additions of strings and brass to many (but not all) of the tracks. Personally I don't mind those touches so much; they add sonic interest to the album, though I admit sometimes they work better than other times. But my real problem with this album is its overall songwriting blandness. None of these songs are memorable, and certainly not forty years later. There is some good drumming here, and some solid vocal performances, but hardly any melodies to speak of; the band seems to get by on their solid, energetic performances. Had they been given some catchy songs, and/or tried a few more sonic experiments, they might have been worth remembering more. Even the Rolling Stones had some great melodies and hooks in those days, and this album pines for a few."
4,Porcupine Tree - 4 Chords...,The first cut(4 chords) is an interesting blend of guitar and tabla. This tune is in a more conventional format than some of PT's lengthier excursions and probably represents the best chance for FM airplay. The Even less demo is a great study in Wilson's construction techniques. The drum and keyboard sounds are distinct from the album version. The hooks are less well defined than those on album cut. At 15:44 this cut has ample time to meander through soundscapes and more fully develop themes. Really quite tasty.
2,They weren't successful for a reason,"well, i read an article explaining that the pretty things were poised on becoming huge in the british invasion years, but tragically did not. this album justifies their failure. from the horrible tunes to the horn section (added later by the record company) to the dreadful lyrics, it's a total flop. there are 19 tracks on this album. 5 are doubled and 1 is tripled. also, the cover's typeface was clearly grand theft from the beatles 'rubber soul.' so there."
4,A very good handbook on eoconomic (and more) information.,"This is an excellent book of the Cyprus economy. The author gives the reader a general understanding of the background of Cyprus; history, culture, demographics. Following this, the book introduces the reader to the economy of the island. A very useful book for someone interested in the prosperity of the island, as a business man or investor."
4,delicious,This is a very tasty product but way overpriced on line. The sauce is readily available at most markets at a much lower price (much lower).
3,"Great, but overpriced","I love this stuff and add it to all my stir-fries: it's delicious, and not sweet, like the Rooster. But this is ovepriced. The same 8 oz. little plastic jar sells for $2.89 at my corner bodega, and they charge a premium for being open 24 hours. When I make it to a grocery store, the jar is usually $2.29. So the price here is more than double. Two stars deducted for the overprice; five stars for the sauce itself."
4,enjoyed,gave as a gift. as far as i know they enjoyed the movie. i thought it was excellent and had to pass it on
5,"Quietly stunning (in this case, I don't think that's oxymoronic)","This sweet, charming movie is one of those hidden gems one encounters by serendipitously not going to bed at the usual time on a weekend. I've discovered many of my now-favorite movies this way.How DO the British excel at this so? The cast is phenomenal, and their performances are of precisely the caliber one expects when a good play meets great players.Admittedly, the film may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is exactly mine. Bravi!"
2,Kept waiting for something to happen.,Love Meryl Streep but the dancing on the green grass makes you think this is going to be a happy dancing movie. It is not. (And they don't even dance on green grass.)
3,A very sad movie,"This movie is a very different picture of 30's Ireland than inThe Informer - Authentic Region 1 DVD from Warner Brothers with Victor McLaglen, Heather Angel, Preston Foster and Directed by JOHN FORD. The Catholic church abandoning an old sick priest after yearsof service in a leper colony in Africa and then, firing his sister by association,just is hard to place in the ideas of any kind of church?The ""going native"" of this Irish priest really doesn't seem to be his fault.The result was in the end tragic for the familywith a young boy to raise. The movie just has a lot of heart andno real point that I could figure.I didn't like the movie."
3,Interesting look at original culture of Ireland!,"Interesting look at original culture of Ireland! Loved the movie, loved Ireland ""as it was"" in those days. No electronics, no kids staring at internet screens all day. It was how life used to be before modern technology took over the world and changed us with no return. This will take you back in time! Enjoy!"
1,ACK!!!!!,"To those unacquainted with Brian Friel's wonderful stage play of the same name, this might be a mediocre, possibly even enjoyable film. Those of us, however, who know the REAL Dancing at Lughnasa are sure to hit the stop button on the VCR after the first five minutes. Oh, to be sure, the characters and BASIC storyline are the same in both the movie and the stage play, but there the end. In the movie, too many ""behind-the'scenes"" scenes are shown, depriving the audience of the brilliant ""memory"" feel of the stage play. One almost wonders if Friel collaborated on this terrible adaptation, or if he is instead pursuing litigation. There are some good points, however (I'm not ENTIRELY negative). The acting was pretty good (although some of the actors could have used a bit more dialect coaching) and the scenery & locations were outstanding. However, these were simply not enough to save this movie from a grisly end in my trash bin."
2,"mediocre, at best","I really looked forward to the arrival of my copy of this video. Yes, I actually bought it! Only because it's impossible to find at video rental stores. (perhaps I know why, now)I'm usually quite an 'easy audience' for all things Celtic... be it music, films, storylines... but this? Well, it was a big disappointment. I found myself frequently glancing up at the clock wondering how far along into the movie I was. I kept waiting for *something* to happen. It never really does. The emotional and moral (?) conflict and differences between the sisters was flat, uninteresting and petty. And the resolution of those differences...well, all ended in a very anti-climatic, boring ending, hardly seen as a resolution for anyone.This movie might be watchable...but only once, in my opinion. I may as well sell my copy in the Amazon auctions, I know I'll never watch it again."
2,TOO MUCH TALKING AND TOO LITTLE DANCING,"FIRST LET ME SAY THAT THERE IS NO BIGGER FAN OF MERYL STREEP THAN I AM. THAT BEING SAID, THIS MOVIE WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT. I HAD HEARD JAMES LIPTON EXTOLL THE VIRTUES OF MERYL'S IRISH DANCING IN THIS FILM WHICH MADE ME WANT TO SEE IT. HER DANCING LASTED ALL OF THREE MINUTES! SHE IS HER USUAL TERRIFIC SELF, BUT THE MOVIE WAS TOO SLOW FOR ME."
1,Stellar cast and director can't save this turkey!,"God, what a disappointment! I am a huge fan of both Meryl Streep and Michael Gambon, and I know Brian Friel has written some wonderful plays and screenplays -- so I couldn't believe what a dismal bore this turned out to be. As other reviewers have said, practically NOTHING happens, except that these five lonely, pathetic, spinster sisters sit around and bicker at each other. Streep's character is a priggish, joyless nag who makes her sisters even more depressed than they already have reason to be. At times the film seems to be building up to some climactic event (somebody will die or get knocked up), but then... nothing. And the sisters' big, exuberant dance scene near the end seemed totally fake and tacked-on to me -- I suspect they included that just so they could put it in the movie's trailer!"
4,great product,This is a great product I have only recently started using. In combination with bouncy cream my curly hair is manageable. I would highly recomend to anyone with curly/frizzy hair is great.
5,ISO Bouncy Clean,"I love using this product, it always arrives on time and is a product which stands up to it's name."
1,No Documentation,"There was no English language documentation included and markings on the equipment itself were in Chinese. Also, it never seemed to work properly once I set it up via trial and error."
5,A blast from the past,"I'm not exactly sure where I had seen this movie originally but finding it here on amazon was exciting. For those who are familiar with the series then you should definitely have this particular episode as a part of your collection. For those new to it, these are great films for the kids. I watched it as a child and loved it. To have it on DVD is something special."
4,Great to Remember trips,"This is a great journal for taking on long trips. It was hardback book size with no lines of the pages so you have a lot of freedom with what you put inside. I used a lot of the pages to tape postcards in that I got from different places or pictures of placres that I talked about. There are three decorated sections of pages, one of them did give me a little trouble reading because it was bright blue. Other then that, no problems! It has a pocket in the back to store things and a strap to keep it closed. This book has everything to help you remember your trip!"
5,Makes you want to write!,"I have a different version of this journal, it's green rather than blue and it has a different picture on the front, but it's basically the same. I really like it. I don't use it as a travel journal, but just as a diary. It's so satisfying to fill up a page and move to the next one. But anyway, it's a little pricey, but I think that it was worth it."
2,Not Worth The Read...,"This is a review of The Fiery Angel not the Occult Reader. To be fair one has to credit Dedalus with printing this along with it's expansive list of rare and obscure occult themed fiction, it fits right in. However this one was best destined to remain out of print. The Fiery Angel is a weak blend of touristic occult nonsense and weaker still Gothic romance. It was a real grind to read as it was full of awkward turns of phrase and frankly terrible occult flirtations that illustrate that the author knew nothing of the topic. In fact he ends the book with an explicit and heavy handed catholic denouncement of the entire practice. One wonders if he did this to save his reputation or to admit that he was ignorant of all occult matters. This book is saved only by a amusing but ultimately pedestrian description of the Witch's Sabbath. Avoid this one and enjoy other Occult literature that is more than a crappy romance in attractive wrapping paper."
5,Ahhh..... Stephanie,Another winner. I can read these books over and over. I fell in love with Gabriel as a character. Now on to Lucifer!
4,A good balance.,"As all Stephanie Laurens books, this is riddled with intrigue, but has a nice balance of romance as well. To me, its interesting that Gabriel Cynster finds his ""one true love"" has been right under his nose all of his life as a childhood friend."
5,A Secret Love is outstanding,I've read all of the Bar Cynster series because of this one book. It definitely started it all! Unfortunately I gave it away after reading it 2 times because I never read books more than once or twice. After a few months though I'm missing it and may have to buy it.Alathea and Gabriel's story is original and sensual. I couldn't put it down. The sexual tension is woven throughout each scene and the constant suspense that Gabriel will find out Alathea is the mysterious countess leaves you breathless. Laurens is a master with the sensual love scenes and each one is different and lushly sexual. Definitely a keeper!
3,Good read but...,"Historical romance exciting read. ..The love scenes are well written and the chase - exciting. I found the last chapters a stretch and unnecessary. Without it , this would be a 4 star book for me."
3,I'm a little torn...,"On the one hand, I really loved the characters of Alathea and Gabriel. I thought they were really great together, and had great passion. On the other hand, I found the plot too unbelievable. Normally a little far fetched plot wouldn't bother me, but for some reason I just couldn't get past the whole idea that Gabriel had no idea who the woman under the veil was, even after spending so much time together and being intimate. The other problem I had with this book was the author's tendency to get too long winded and repeat the same things over and over again throughout the story. I found myself wanting to skip through a number of sections. I had previously read Devil's Bride and really enjoyed it, then skipped the next three books in the series because of the mediocre reviews, and was hoping this would be as good or better than Devil's story, but unfortunately it fell a bit short for me."
3,Unbelievable,"One of my least favorite Laurens books. I simply find it too unbelievable. Gabriel Cynster has a relationship with Alathea, who poses as a veiled Countess in order to hide her identity from him. Even though they grew up together, and she's nearly six-feet tall, a rarity for the time, and even though he makes love to her several times, he still doesn't know who she is until deep into the story. Though the writing is good, which is why I'm giving it thee stars, the premise is simply too far-fetched even for a romance novel. I couldn't take the story serious enough to get into it."
1,Blah....,"Okay. So I have read the five Cynster men books. My favorite is Scandal's Bride. I have to agree with one reviewer who talks about the books being about spunky women who know it all to and take down the mature man. Can anyone, please, explain to me the purpose of the Countess being covererd as if she was in a Moslem country and Gabriel making love to a women he could not see? I am guessing that that was supposed to be ""romantic"" but how many people make love to people they can't even see????? Also, is the fabled August meeting of the clan ever going to take place? What was nice about Scandal's Bride is that we actually get to visit with the Cynster men and their ladies after their stories end. I hope the book with Lucifier brings us back to them again. Also, why are the time periods so rushed? It is as if one man marries, the next month the next, and so on. How about a few years in between? Again, this book was, really, sort of stupid."
4,a good read,"...Secret Love has a much more interesting plot and a definately better heroine! The first part of the book, where they met without Gabriel knowing who she really was and tried to understand why he felt so strange when Althea was near, was a delight. The erotic scenes are hot and you can really feel the sparks between the two of them.Also Chillingsworth who appeared in both books, is a very interesting role who deserves his own story.Go on and read it, you certainly won't be disappointed, you may even love it!"
4,A rollicking good ride!,Stephanie Laurens once again provides an interlude rich with characters and fantasy. Rupert and the Countess meet obstensibly to exchange information about a swindle that's about to ruin the Countess's family but the she always ends up undressed (who in their right mind would go to a clandestine meeting in a dark bedroom?) However its so well done you don't care. That Chillingworth needs his own book. This book provides a number of delightful hours of otherworldly stress relief.
2,Running out of steam,"I loved the first 3 books of this series, but Laurens is running out of steam in this one. The storyline goes way beyond contrived. I suggest you stick with the Devil's Bride and skip this one."
5,Maltesers,it's been a while since i last had Maltesers. it becomes hard to find in the market. Everytime i eat Whoppers it always remind me of how better the Maltesers are... sad it's rare. until it pops in my mind i should go look in Amazon and alas found it! every person's taste is different but for me this is the best chocolate malt... the center feels like it melts away. chocolate lovers should give this a try.
5,Throw your Whoppers away!,"Go ahead and forget everything you think you know about the delicacy known as chocolate covered maltballs. Now try these ->Mars Maltesers chocolate coated piecesThese little jewels are made by the same company, MARS, but they are from a different manufacturing plant in the UK. The chocolate is rich and creamy, the malt center is crisp, crunchy, and clean. The entire experience is different than what we have in the US known as ""Whoppers"" and some lesser known regional brands.But be careful; once I tried Maltesers, I cannot put what I had grown to know and love in my mouth anymore. I'm scouring the web for these babies and I found them here on Amazon. Lucky for me they come in multipacks!Mars Maltesers 37g x 5 PackEnjoy"
1,Maltezers should be renamed Meltezers!,"I was excited to order this as little gift enhancers for my family which loves Maltezers. However, they arrived in their packets all melted and stuck together like glue so that what I got was one melted clump of malt balls -- each packet was the same -- very disappointing!"
1,are you kidding???,"For $9.99 they sent me 5 two oz. Pkgs. With about 10 small malted candies in each. That makes each pkg. Cost $2. and each little malt ball $.20 each. I don't care how good they are, this is an outrageous price. Live and learn I guess."
5,Tracks for this album!,Track Listing:I'm gonna love youHey little girlSomeone to love meYou don't love meIf I could do it all overEverybody has to cryThat's itOh DarlingHave mercy someonePlease take me backI found loveSet your sights higher
2,Japanese Spiral Slicer,I would not recommend this for raw preparation. It is not easy to operate and is labor intensive. I purchased the Paderno Turning Slicer and love it.Marilyn B.
3,It's okay but...,"For a price of less than $10, this is a pretty good cross. The pewter hasn't oxidized yet,but feels like ok quality. The design workmanship is a bit disappointing because the circular solar element has no knotting at all, which is the first Celtic Cross I've seen this way. This ring is simply smooth and mirror-like, and has the effect of looking like a 3/4 inch nickelplate washer. Looks a bit unfinished and therefore cheap, I must say. I really do like the black drawstring, which allows the Cross to hang at various heights, according to whether and how you want to show it. Again, for the price, one can't really complain. I didn't look closely enough at the photo to notice the inappropriately untooled ring element."
1,A double disappointment,"I had actually ordered the other Celtic cross from Dan's Jewelers (priced at $11.84), and so the fact that they sent this one in error was the first disappointment. When I examined this item, I was also disappointed in the workmanship--the engraving is shallow and off-center, and the cross looks very ""cheap."" I've seen a lot of Celtic-style jewelry in a wide range of prices, and this is definitely ""low-end"" in every respect."
3,"It's okay, if you like pewter.","I've had this for 4 years now. I'm amazed it lasted this long. Cleaning pewter is not my strong point, but it's as easy as cleaning silver."
5,Beautiful,I love Celtic crosses and this one is by far the most beautiful one I own. It was worth the price.
4,exciting,Well written and suspenseful. This is a great book for those of us with busy minds. Keeps you thinking all the way through.
5,FABULOUS BOOK,THE PICTURES ARE SPECTACULAR AND THE DESCRIPTIONS AND HINTS ARE THE BEST I'VE COME ACROSS - THANK YOU SO MUCH
5,GREAT RESCUE PACK!,We bought this rescue pack for my son's Diego Halloween costume - he LOVES it! It is great quality and fits great (he is 3 and about 38 lbs). I didn't see anything else like it and we love it. Definitely a great buy!
5,perfect likenes to the story,"We're new Diego fans & my son wants everything that Diego has. This fit the bill - it looks exactly like Diego's on TV, is easy on & off for little hands, just the right size for a 3.5 year old, and nicely made - a hit with everyone!"
3,my son loves it.. however...,"my son had a diego themed bday party, ofcourse the rescue pack is a huge part of the costume so it took me forever to finally find one that I liked. As soon as I received this product we lloved it! My son was very happy and I was happy that the product was big enough for his toys... not too big for a toddler.. and made of strong, durable material... well.. a week after using this product (no rough playing since it is the famous ""rescue pack"" and my son takes good care of it) the bag is tearing from the top seam. Im not too happy with that since the bag was no $5 bag. I really expected a lot more from what seem a strong durable bag."
1,Not a happy mother or child,This bag is a made in china crap. Customer service was more than awesome but I do not recommend this bag.
4,Still a fine read!,"OK, folks, here it is, April, 2002, and Ferguson's book is 5 years old with GPS technology advancing at an amazing pace... but the true value of his book isn't his discussion on the hardware - it's the absolute wealth of information about LAND NAVIGATION that makes it an enduring treasure! I have found myself coming back to it time and again over my past 4 years of ownership to dig into finer detail about the GPS system, or coordinate systems, or whatever else is associated with land nav using GPS. Despite the outdated GPS hardware commentary, the principles remain the same, and MF's treatment is superb - the measure by which others will be considered.If you need a basic reference that ties together LAND NAVIGATION with GPS, this should be in your library (along with Bjorn Hjellstrom's classic, ""Map & Compass"").73, Bob..."
5,Amazing sights,This is a marvelous documentary which takes you to the ocean floor and shows you things you would never see otherwise. Amazing shots of alien-like creatures which inhabit those depths. The bright young scientists in this documentary add greatly to this film.
2,superficial & unfunny,"I didn't find this funny. I thought it was superficial, sloppy and dumb. The number of places reviewed seems very slight, and their descriptions are overly long, as if they were trying to pad the book."
1,Not worth the paper it is printed on,"Perhaps all guide books should be destroyed as soon as they are six months old. I don't know, I just returned to LA after a 16 year absense, and I ordered a bunch of guide books to help me make the best out of this new adventure. This book really doesn't have much to offer."
4,Re-Mastered DVD a MUST !!!,"This and ""ALL"" of the mgm musicals need to be re-mastered in Dolby Digital DVD right away so we can ENJOY the way it was meant to be seen..."
5,The Enjoyable Road to Life Mastery,"This is a great gift for yourself or others. It's attractive, so it really makes one want to get involved with this life-enhancing path. The author , as you probably know, is well-immersed in this field. In this book/journal, she offers a weekly lesson for introspection and illumination. These lessons include a thought for reflection that is the essence of that week's journey. The last half of the book offers lined journal pages for your use in exploring journal topics, etc. Every page is nicely decorated with shamanistic symbols. Each week's topics are not just random; they are designed in an order to lead the reader on a year-long quest for better Self-hood. It's really an exciting opportunity packaged in an enticing workbook."
3,"A kid's dream, but for older people, ugh...","I loved this movie when I was a kid, but, like so many other relics of childhood, it has not stood the test of time. This movie is categorized as a ""Comedy"" but I think it is more of a loopy, albeit fun, kid's movie. There is nothing realistic about the film, and it seems to be a parody about...well... everything. Keep in mind that this can be a very entertaining plot for young kids... it was entertaining for me when I was little, but older people, say 14+, will probably like something more grown-up, like Batman. :-)"
2,Not as good as I remember,"I first saw this movie when I was pretty young and just recently gave it another viewing. Not impressed! This movie is pretty ridiculous. On top of that, I kept wondering what sort of mother had raised such sneaky, dishonest, irresponsible, leeches of children! I mean, there are a couple of moments when the movie is entertaining, but, if I were you, I would borrow this movie from the library rather than plunk down any of your own money for it."
2,Don't Tell Mom I Am Dead!,"... AS you can see the Title of my review the movie just [stunk]! I first saw it on [TV] and decided I'd watch it. Little to my surpise it was a good movie but after Sue Ellen(AppleGate) gets a job it goes down the heel... The kids are left at home with no money and little Blonde supporting the family while their mom has gone to Euroupe with her Boyfriend on a Busines Trip. The plot is a real bad one. Its the summer time with their mom on a business trip. After that I went Zzzz! It was snooze central. My brother kept watching it and I got sick the same night we both watched it. But anyway, back to the Plot. The 5 kids are being baby-sitted by a 100 year old woman. When the kids experince trouble in the house their baby-sitter dies.If You like Corny and Comedy films, this would be the best movie for your collection. If You like Horror and Mature viewing this isn't the movie for you Collection!"
3,not too good just ''okay'',"this movie was really hilarious,but so unrealistic i mean,christina applegate got away with so much like lying to a business about her age and stuff and she didn't even go to prison or anything!"
1,i have no product yet,"I am a little disappointed I have not received this product yet, and it don't have a tracking number so I cann't track it"
3,Funny!,"""Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead"" was one of my favorite movies as a child. I always thought it was so cool that the four kids got to spend the entire summer by themselves without anyone telling them what to do!The story revolves around a family whose mother has gone on a trip to Austrailia for the summer. Thinking they're home-free, the kids are shocked to find out that their mother has hired a babysitter to watch over them while she's gone. At first the babysitter seems like a nice old lady, but as soon as their mother is gone, she becomes worse than a drill sargeant. Unfortunately, the babysitter dies in her sleep and the family must learn how to survive the entire summer with no money. Christina Applegate's character goes and finds work at a uniform company by lying on her resume. You will be shocked at what this family accomplishes!I would recommend this film especially to kids and teenagers. Adults might find this film a little far-fetched, but kids will definitely enjoy it!!!"
5,Christina Applegate in one of her early roles,"I bought this one for my kids, and they loved it! Lots of good clean fun suitable for all ages."
1,Unhappy with this DVD,This is a half edited version of the regular movie and no where on the description does it say that the movie is an edited version. Not happy at all!
2,Poor quality,"The movie is amazing like always, but the quality on the copy I ended up with was very poor. It looked less like a major movie and more like a low budget reality show as far as the the way it looked."
3,MY FAVE MOVIE!!!,"This movie is my all-time favorite movie!!! I spent my childhood watching it on HBO and still catch it whenever i can! But sadly, i'm soo disappointed in the quality of the dvd! The clarity is great but the movie sounds and looks sped up!!!!!!!! a tear!!!!!!!!"
3,Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead,"Christina Applegate is surprisingly good in this cult classic playing Sue Ellen. After the babysitter dies from old age, she finds herself responsible for her four younger brothers and sisters for the entire summer. As much as she hates it, Sue Ellen has to get a job to support them all. When she applies for a receptionist job with a clothing manufacturer, her fabricated resume lands her a job with the chief executive. This is a lighthearted movie with many funny scenes."
4,"Good movie, good print on DVD","Please note several reviews of this movie here are referring to earlier VHS version. We just purchased this on DVD (we love this movie) and it is in widescreen (well, 16:9, that ""sort of"" widescreen) and has very clear picture and excellent sound quality.We delayed purchasing this because of a lack of info on Amazon page regarding the specifics of the DVD, but it's fine, we're very happy with it.If you like the movie, it's a good DVD and certainly worth the $5-6 price."
2,"The movie's good, the DVD is awful","This is a movie that I quite enjoy. That said, the DVD version I just purchased is the absolute pits. It looks as though it were shot on a home video camera, and the ambience of the film is totally altered. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the movie is good enough to keep even the worst DVD authoring to merit a one-star. Watch this if you see it on TV, or maybe even buy the tape. The DVD, however, is something you want to steer clear of."
2,Started out good but it got ridiciolous.,"I was looking for a cool comedy and I was disappointed! This is one of those try-hard comedies that try way too hard to be funny and turn into slack, dumb peices of poo. Christina Applegate is alright, but the story goes way too fast, the granny should of stayed in for longer, she was the good part. This is a classic, but its a miss, sorry, Christina."
3,review,hi. i never went so school and i dont know how to write reviews and i run sentences together and dont capatalize my i's.
1,Garbage!,I use to like this movie when I was in elementary but now that I'm 16 I don't really like this film. The dialogue is corny and the movie is really slow. It's sort of like a spoof from Home Alone and jokes related to Bill and Ted's. I hate it when they have movies where they make fun of Bill and Ted's because Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is one of my favorites of all time. I just hope they won't make another movie like that but stay away from this movie it's horrible. If you were in elementary you'll like it but I'm older now and I think it's stupid.
3,Fun to look back on,"This is Christina Applegate's first big movie, so i you are a fan this is definitely a neccesity. This movie definitely has its funny moments, but much of the humor is too obvious. If you liked this movie when you were a kid I highly reccoment buying it. There are many jokes that you will get now that you didn't at the time. Also, anybody who is a fan of the early 90s must have this. It is definitely one of the most memorable kid/teen movie from the early 90's/"
4,Don't Tell Mom The Babysitters Dead,This is a movie that came out a few years ago but is still a favorite of mine. It is a family classic and is enjoyable for all ages.
2,I did not like it,"It was not my cup of tea. But just because I did not like it, you may. This was not my kind of movie."
5,movie,I love this movie! I just had to have it for my collection. its a classic movie. will never get old in my eyes. :)
4,Too bad they spoiled it,"I wish that they could've made this movie with less strong cuss words. It would otherwise be a good, funny, family movie. However, the stoner kids ""f"" words are too much. I wish I could show it because the underlying message is good & the kids pull it together in the end. I think that they were going for the teen sales and wanted to make it ""cool""."
3,got it with a big scratch on it!,"i haven't got a chance to watch it, but i opened it from a BRAND new package. it had shifted during shipping, i assume, & the dvd recieved a very big scratch on it. not sure if it'll effect how the movie plays."
3,Did not remember such bad language in this movie,"Overall, the storyline is good and I like the way it ends. However, I did not remember it having as much bad language as it does nor did I remember certain themes. So I was a little disappointed in it."
5,The Babysitter is dead and nothing to worry about!!!!,This movie is the best movie i have ever seen! This movie is about this mom going to Austrilla for a vaction! and she leaves her children with an old babysitter that dies! so the oldest girl has to go out and find a job! this movie is great for any family! This is the best i have seen this movie a lot of time and wedensday i am going to buy it off of Amazon!
5,Purchased a DVD Comedy,The movie came very promply. Transaction was very smooth. We were very pleased with everything.
4,Vintage movies are so much better.,"Not alot of language to mute out, just a great old video, Wish more modern movies were this family friendly.."
2,Is this the same Armin?,Wow what happened? An equisite DJ with a pretty crumby cd. His live performances put this cd to a pitiful shame. Don't waste your dough on this. His live at Ibiza is multitudes better.
2,An Average Mix From A Notable DJ,"In comparison to his ""A State of Trance 2004"" (which was expertly rendered) and Mark Schulz's ""Miami '05"" (which, in my view, far surpasses Mr. Van Buuren's current works), Armin Van Buuren's ""A State of Trance 2005"" is very much lacking in quality, most apparently in its choice and flow of music. Although Mr. Van Buuren's mixing techniques are still consistently top-notch, this set of mix simply does not engender the kind of applause that was instantly recognized and continuously reinforced by listening to some of his earlier works. Coupled with the disappointing experience of his ""Universal Religion 2004"" and in light of higher quality trance mixes presently created by other notable DJ's, Mr. Van Buuren should reevaluate the current ""state"" of his ""trance"" selections and recreate the kind of magic that ""A State of Trance 2004"" so unmistakably demonstrates. Not recommended for participants of the rave scene!"
2,It's OK,"Doesn't do it for me. Go to sleep Armin... You'll never be a Paul Oakenfold, DJ Tiesto, or Carl Cox."
3,State of Trance 2004 is much better!,"State of Trance 2005 has some strong moments and some weak moments. Disk 1 is beautiful and the song selections are great. It is one of those disks that puts you in a good mood and makes you just want to let it all go. Isn't that what trance is all about? You'll find Armin in his comfort zone and doing what he does best. Disk 2 finds him trying to expand and take on more aggressive tracks. He stumbles a few times and you'll hear that he is not there yet. The selections are quite generic and there isn't a great flow to this second disk. You'll end up taking it out and going back to the first disk. I think that maybe he'll get it right in 2006. If you're really into the dark and progressive stuff. You should lend your ear to Acosta, Lawler or Fontaine. Otherwise, Armin is still one of the hottest DJs out there and State of Trance 2004 will show you how he got there!"
5,Armin Does it Again,"One of the years best mix compilations. I won't say much about it but I give it my highest grade, 5 stars. Enjoy you trance lovers."
2,trance is dying,"this is a horrible mix by armin. the song selection is also very bad except for a few songs. the beats are not crisp and there is no flow in the mix. i don't know why this album has such a great avg rating. i think he's just tried to put in some songs there just so he'd release another album. didn't expect this from the world's #3 dj.i bought creamfields(oakenfold) along with this, which i was very happy with. but nothing can compare mixes by pvd. cant wait for politics of dancing 2 to be released."
1,What happened?,This is by far the worst cd I have ever purchased. AVB needs to not off the star playing and get bback to his fan base. The transitions are terrible-the selection of tracks are aweful. What a waste of $20.00!!!! Oh well-live and learn
4,"Good, but not the best of Armin","Having been introduced to armin through A State of Trance 2004, I fell in love with his work. The mixing on that CD was great, just as the tracklist. I followed through with many of his old and new mixes, looked at different aliases (like Rising Star) and basically loved everything. Clearly, I was excited to buy ASoT 2005 as soon as it came out.However, having listened to the CD, I did not feel that it matched AVB's abilities. Not to say that the CD was bad; it had some new big hits, and some not as well known tracks. Yet it sounded somewhat too bland to earn its 5 stars.If you're a big fan of trance, you'll still enjoy it. But if you're expecting something on the level of his 2004 ASoT, sorry.And since everyone seems to give recommendations of other CDs, here are mine: ATB - In The Mix 2, Cosmic Gate - Back 2 Back Vol 2, Tiesto - In Search of Sunrise 4."
3,Same trance all over and over,"I liked it but it did not go to my favorites.I love diferente stiles of music, the variation in stiles, beats but this did not did it for me."
3,"Very lyrical, but. . .","Although there is much lovely writing in these stories, a reader who hasn't much interest in the wilderness could get bored very quickly. I began skimming after a while, as I longed for a suburban setting or two or a little city grit. Just too much information about trees and tree related subjects. It also has a slight egotistical quality, and mostly the women get short shrift. I do think Mr. Parvin has a future in writing though. He just needs to get himself out of the stories a little more."
2,Mostly a waste of my time,"I purchased this book so I might learn to improve my relationships, health, and energy so I can be a better person to myself, husband, and two small children. While it does offer medical information (on a basic level) of causes for fatigue and other points on the modern day stresses women face, it does not reveal any new ideas. One example is the idea behind weight management. The approach is similar to Weight Watchers -- using formulas and diaries. While it is a smart approach it does not integrate well for the hurried woman. Overall a disappointment... I did not find this book inspiring, helpful, or healing."
5,"Amusing, common sense read","While I agree with some other reviewers that this author repeats information given by other sources, that is hardly a reason for not reading this book. Lots of authors have done the same thing in their books. Anyway, Dr. Bost, is very funny and I imagine he is understanding and caring as a doctor. I found this book very helpful and insightful. Sometimes we all the need obvious pointed out to us! Dr. Bost does that in a way that is not condescending or patronizing. I found he was able to cover a lot of ground in this book, mentioning areas of life that we frequently overlook that contribute to the overall condition of our lives. Check it out for your self and decide on your own."
4,who financed hitler,this book changed a students whole outlook on hitler that he had done a term paper on and after reading the book asked his professor could he rewrite the paper.i'm not sure if he was allowed or not but the book was a big hit.
1,An untruthful and unscholarly book,"This book was comprised mainly from speculation and from rumors without true evidence to support the claims that were made. The author has admitted to not researching nor fully reviewing the sources and archives listed in his works cited. If you want to read a truthful, honarable scholarly work pertaining to the subject of Hitler and his financiers (or lack there of), you should take you time and read Henry Ashby Turner's ""German Big Business and The Rise of Hitler."" Don' waste your time on this ""get rich quick"" book."
2,Small!,"This item should not be listed as a 2t-4t, I bought this for my 2 year old who is wearing size 3t-4t clothing and it was entirely too short for him, both the pants and the shirt, as well as the wig fitting on his head. But fortunately amazon has great support and is making everything easier with returning and refunds! As for a 1 year old or one just turning 2 this would make a great costume. Just had to go with a bigger size for my son."
5,Interesting Film!,I don't really understand what everyone is talking about when referring to Ms. Robert's performance. I thought it was exceptional. It was nice to see her stretch. Anyway Malkovich was fantastic! This story was great and I thought it was well executed on film. Close had an interesting role also and I loved hearing her accent. See this one.
5,Bravo!,"Though this movie is different from the book, I am not sorry I bought it. Julia Roberts and John Malkovich were totally believable in their roles. I have watched this a lot since I purchased it. SCORE!"
5,Mary Reilly,"I enjoyed this DVD as it was an usual treatment of the subject, which differed from the other DVD I saw. JMH"
3,"Great mood, story dragged","I'm with the critics on this one. But I loved the settings, photography, and mood and so that balances out lacklustre dialogue, direction, and acting. It is worth sticking it out to see Malkovich's sinister face and the scenes that involve the kitchen staff and the wonderful grimy street scenes.Other than that, for me at least, the story dragged somewhat tediously. Julia Roberts hardly acted, whereas she might have and that would have only improved the film. Her inner conflicts did leave room for some character development that just seemed missing. Malkovich also seemed largely to be just reciting his lines most of the time. The creepy music was a bit boring to the point of being slightly distracting. Yet the overall mood was well-done creepy all things considered.Sorry fans, I just did not see it as you did. ""Julia's most powerful performance"" it says on the case. I simply can't see it that way."
5,Physiological Thriller,Loved this movie! Unspoken love and admiration. Nice ending but a little disappointed. Would incourage others to purchase this item.
3,Julia Roberts shines...,"...in this Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde film. I've never been a Julia Roberts fan but she was pitch perfect in some key scenes. A good, if not great, morality tale."
5,Julia Roberts at her best,"Very atmospheric and compelling film. Jeckyll & Hyde seen through the eyes of young victorian house maid Mary Reilly, Julia Roberts in a perfect role. This is the type of film that shows her acting to its best advantage, only wish we could see her in more like this. John Malcovitch was great playing the duel roles of the reserved, gentler Dr Jeckyll and the strong volatile Mr Hyde.Wonderful to watch."
4,Julia's got moves you never knew,"This film marks the rebirth of Julia Roberts. The casting agent picked a peach when they made this one. Julia is perfect opposite the lush Cameron Diaz who sparkles in her role as the naive bride-to-be. The movie has a heavenly sound track which brings many decade-or-so old classics back to life. Whilst the dialogue is laden with hilarious inserts from Rupert Everett who is the epitome of gay charm. As romantic comedies go this one is up there: one for the video rack- hey, buy the soundtrack too!"
1,Did not work.,"The dvd did not work. We tried it in three different dvd players and got a broken up, shattered picture...if any at all. VERY disappointed."
4,Wonderfully Creepy,"This alternative look at the Jeckyl/Hyde story is a well-crafted glimpse of late 19th century London. Atmospheric and creepy, it provides both fascination and chills galore."
3,"Just best album, nothing new about it","This album, if I'm not mistaken since there's no image of it, is just one of those 'best of' albums, but it is a good one. Also this album is only one of four series of the same release, they are ""best of silk road"", ""best of earth"", ""best of heaven"", ""best of universe"", I have them all, imported from china, so there's no new songs at all. Unless you're a big fan of kitaro like I am or never bought kitaro at all, don't buy this album."
3,streamers,"These streamers are like all others, cheap and disposable. the price was right on these and they fit just right on my little girls bike."
4,Through the eyes of someone that was really there.,"This is one of the diaries I used in my research for my Civil War novel,Chase The Wild Pigeons: A novel of the Civil War. As some of the other reviews have noted, she is very detailed. However, her perspective is from the Southern high society. If you want to get that view, you must read her diary. We owe here for keeping such good records."
3,Hard to Read,This book is very interesting but it is hard to follow. The intro is very interesting but once you get into the diary part she skips from one topic to another and it assumes a lot. I think it will be worthwhile - it is just going to take me a while to get through it.
3,It is Okay,"This book wasn't exactly what I thought it was. It is written in language that is fairly hard to read and contains a lot of information that is completely boring! I really enjoy this era of book, but I found A Confederate Memoir of the Civil War to be a much better read."
5,Wow,"This is definetly one of the best songs on the new CD, you can hear a megamix of the new album at americandisco.net but be warned, some of these songs really [aren't good]. This is the first single i have heard since Move Your Body that really has chart potential. Contact was the best album, but unfortunately few singles were released (the best of which - 80's Stars, check it out). Really nice beats also check out gabry's new album. the vocals are catchy and the music is much improved from their first material. the beats are more sophistocated and extensive, reaching far beyond the relative childs play of europop. overall, amazing single. newest single-Que Chelli E non hanna:) TU CREDI ROCKS!:)"
4,AN INTELLIGENT THRILLER THAT LOSES A BIT OF STEAM AT THE END,"This murder mystery has some nice twists to it but loses some of its quality at the end. That said, it's still a good to very good film. The cast is impressive: Sean Connery, Kate Capshaw, Laurence Fishburne, Ed Harris, Blair Underwood, Ruby Dee and then child actress, Scarlett Johansson. The Florida Everglades gives it a raw and spooky quality. Harris is borderline over the top but it works. Based on a novel of the same title by Jeffrey Katzenbach.STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; TWISTS/SURPRISES: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: early October 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus."
2,Another lost cause for Connery,"Just Cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you've got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet Sean Connery's wife (a typically mannered and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and kid (a very young Scarlet Johannsen) in an alligator skinner's shack. The kind of movie that's probably best seen on a plane, and even then only once."
3,"Good first 75 minutes, falls apart afterward.","For the first 75 or so minutes, Just Cause is solid movie entertainment. It features a rather unoriginal premise, about a black man accused of raping and murdering a young white girl and is sentenced to death row, but is intriguing, nonetheless. Sean Connery plays Paul Armstrong, the man the accused killer-Bobby Earl-convinces to help find the man truly responsible.Just Cause is an always watchable thriller, and there small plot twists turns along the way. At the 75 minute mark is the movie's big revelation, which is actually a bit more surprising than I thought it would be. But the movie goes downhill from there, resulting in a mess of car chases and fistfights. Still, it's well worth watching for those first 75 or so minutes."
2,Just Cause Review,The movie starts off nicely but ends up to be ridiculous and unconvincing. The actors are basically wasted. The only good thing about this film is James Newton Howard's fine score.
4,Just how bad is the system for black people?,"In this movie the question seems to be ""How evil is evil?""When the police in a local Floria town beat and torture a confession out of a young black man, he asks his grandmother to see a noted Harvard professor and get his help.The complications start about there and involve a mass murderer.It ain't over until it is over,but the question still remains, how many black people confess in small Florida towns just to stop the torture?"
5,Just Cause Review,"This is a great movie. There are suspense and drama and a couple of good twists. There are some excellent performances, as well. I won't say more, as I don't want to ruin the surprises. I've seen it before and wanted to own it. Now to review the purchase experience: When I first received the movie, the holder on the inside of the case, which holds the DVD in place was broken and had allowed the disk to move around in shipment and get scratched. I returned it, at Amazon's expense, and promptly received a new one."
4,A triple-twister!,Our favorite twist-plot movie. Gotta see it! You think you figured it out and... SURPRISE...you didn't. A bit gory. Sean Connery is captivating!
1,THIS CD ON THE SURFACE LOOKS LIKE A ONE OF A KIND,"I truly am a fan of Bobby. I have several of his cds.The main concern I have about this project is the instrumentation. It seems that Randy Waldman, the arranger wanted to use a lot of electronic instrumentaion, which I don't think is appropriate. I personally like accoustic instrumenation.If Bobby wants to be a big band singer, then accoustic instrumentation is what is required.I thought Bobbys' voice was very super and his material was excellent. I would like to buy more cds by Bobby.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."
4,Bobby Caldwell has an amazing feel for this music.,"The arrangements are great and his interpretation classic. For years Bobby has been associated with popular music. His venture into Jazz Standards is more than worth a listen. There are 3 original tunes on this CD, that are as good as the standards they are sandwiched between."
1,I wish it was better quality for the money.,"I received this decal today went to put it on the metal of my snow blower and even after cleaning the area with alcohol waiting 30 minutes it just didn't stick well. The decal is beautiful, But the quality of the material isn't much better than plastic tape.. I wish there was a way to let the company know about this without writing a poor review.. HELP!"
5,Kimberly,Same item in farm stores for less then half the price very happy and arrived in less them time expected!
1,Did not work,Just received this in the mail and when I went to peel of the paper some of letters did not attach to the paper. Then one of the legs on the Deer broke off and I just threw away the item. I have put graphics on before and this is by far the worst!
2,Disappointing,"Unlike the other reviewers, I found this book to be less than helpful. Yes, it does talk some about different literary-related fields, and I stress some, but the book lacks serious discussion of those careers. Plus, it gives limited resources for finding out more information....no websites and no mention of other literary career-related books. It only lists a few professional associations for each career. Also, there were no surprises as to which careers were selected, such as...becoming a librarian. If you just want a taste of what literary careers are out there, this book is worth a skim at your local bookstore, but if you really want to find out about these careers, follow up with books specifically geared toward a particular career."
5,Smarts are more than college derived!,"Mike Rose shows us that smart people are everywhere and that a college education does not confer ""smart"" on people. His examples of working folks highlight their abilities to problem solve, multitask, learn on the spot, and communicate effectively. Employers need to read this book and realize that requiring a college degree for many positions shuts out many qualifeid applicants. I wish more hiring directors would read this book!"
2,An OK book with very poor documentation,"The book is OK. The central theme is that we judge people and their abilities (intelligence) based on the job they hold, and that in dismissing the job as unimportant we also dismiss the individual as unimportant. The thesis is important, but the book belabors the point and spends too much time covering points that otherwise could have been stipulated. The greatest problem with the book is the notes style that is used. It is worthless. The latest trend in publishing is to pull a phrase from the text, highlight it under a notes section at the end of the book, and then present a collection of endnote and bibliographic information. Not only is this format cluttered and unhelpful, but the pull quote is not numerically referenced within the text. This lack of direct reference makes the notes utterly useless. This format is lazy and intellectually dishonest, and the practice needs to be discontinued."
5,Beautiful!!!!,"I fell in love with the light when i first saw it from another manufacture. but since I am an Amazon junky, I wanted check with amazon first. i was so surprised when i found the light on Amazon and for $30 cheaper. Although the shipping company stated I wouldnt get my delivery until sometime in September, i ordered it anyways. On August 6, I received the light and I havent even started painting my daughers room yet! I thought I had so much time. I must say the picture of this light, does not do it justice. The lamp is beautiful!! I cant wait to hang it."
5,A great adventure,"I loved this book!! This memoir seemed so alive and showed Africa for what it was at the time, I really learned alot. I really felt like I was along for the ride.Great read!!!!"
5,"For history and travel buffs, Christians, students of Bible","This video brings the history and actual locales to life from the Acts of St. Paul--the birth of the Bible. The cinematography is brilliant and the references to scripture and biblical events seem to be accurate (I am not a Bible scholar). E.g., the riot of the Ephesians--whose hot little businesses selling icons of the goddess Diana were threatened by the monotheistic Paul--is handled very nicely indeed; there are many such points of interest along Paul's missionary journeys. Much of the filming is in Turkey, a treasure-trove of history and biblical archeology. This film brings the land and ancient times vividly to life, connecting the ancient world to modern times with a light and charming touch that avoids piousness or heavy religiosity-- thus should appeal to history and travel buffs as well as Christians and students of the Bible."
1,Overpriced for Content Value - Very Basic Read,"There seems to be two types of reviews here: those expecting much more for the price and title, and those who knew they were buying a dummy level book.I can offer a solution. There are hundreds of outsourcing blogs, outsourcing basics web sites, outsourcing introductory white papers and how-to's by vendors all available on the internet.If you're reading this online, you're probably literate enough to go out to the web and search for outsourcing basic information on the internet for free. Therefore, I agree with the reviewers who say this is nothing more than a US Today overview article extended into a book with funny graphics. If you need substance, reach for another book. If you start with low expectations, you won't be disappointed, however."
2,"Basic, Dummy Style/Dummy Level Management Advice on Outsourcing",Very basic. Mostly duplicated from other sources. If you're new to outsourcing (and I can't imagine there are many managers out there who are new to outsourcing) then start with a review of this before purchasing.
1,Much Too Simplistic for Business People,I didn't find this book on outsourcing to be particularly insightful or helpful and will not share it with colleagues. Perhaps it was written for dummies or idiots but most people employing Outsourcing or working to evaluate or implement real outsourcing projects are much above this level. I agree with other reviewers on this book. Move to the higher level of books on the subject. This one is to simplistic and dull.
1,Who's Paying These Reviewers?,"I recommend if this books interests you in the least, go to the bookstore and compare it to the smarter (i.e., ""Non-Idiot"") selections. Then you can make up your mind just like I did. Two thumbs down."
2,Stuck in another dimension.,"Two episodes from this re-make of the original series. A few good moments fail to justify them, however. In the first episode a T-Rex eats a mother dinosaur, but one of her ridiculously-big eggs (the biggest dinosaur eggs were the size of a pumpkin) survives and hatches into the only horrific thing in this series - a man in a twee suit resembling that contemptable Son of Godzilla. In the second episode the stranded family find a cavewoman who knows about modern society for no explained reason. She is similar to the cavewomen in countless tacky dinosaur films, tediously enough. There's also a monkey-boy called Stink, unamusingly enough.Cheap episodes sunk by abominable, unlikeable kids, terrible effects and quite embaressing music."
2,no mercy-no action,"pertty weak ppv for the wwe. triple h and kane don,t mix. most of the card was sleepers. lesner and taker in hell in a cell saved the ppv. the match was off the scale. 10 out of 10. other than that forget no mercy."
3,"WWE No Mercy 2002: From Little Rock, AR",Here is the Card1. World Tag Team ChampionshipChris Jericho and Christian vs Booker T and Goldust2. Torrie Wilson vs Dawn Marie3. Rob Van Dam vs Ric Flair4. Cruiserweight ChampionshipJamie Noble vs Tajiri5. Intercontinental and World Heavyweight Championship matchTriple H vs Kane6. WWE Tag Team Championship Tournament Final MatchEdge and Rey Mysterio vs Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit7. Women's ChampionshipTrish Stratus vs Victoria8. Hell in a Cell match for the WWE ChampionshipBrock Lesnar vs The Undertaker
2,A nothing pay per view,"This pay per view was just a throwaway show that was just filler as an excuse to have a pay per view. The event is dull, like all of the 2002 pay per view offerings from wwe. Triple H again stinks up the pay per view with a very boring and dull match with Kane. Triple H needs to start putting guys like Booker T and RVD over instead of wrestling guys like Kane for the 5,000th time. Lesner-Undertaker ""Hell In A Cell"" is a decent enough match for what it is, but doesn't really pick up till the end. Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit save the show with a great performance. However this show is a very boring and uninspired event. AVOID at all costs"
2,Brock Lesnar defeats Undertaker in Hell in a Cell,"The words Hell in a Cell can strike fear into most any competitor. Its unforgiving steel can shorten careers in an instant. Brock Lesnar and Undertaker, however, show no fear in this WWE Championship instant classic."
5,No Mercy!,"I love no Mercy 2002! It's the best DVD in my collection! so many great matches! At the menu, you just don't know where to start!"
3,same old wwe ppv half ass,"the opener sucks.then theres 2 chicks fighting.thats always fun.at least theyre hot this time.then rvd kills ric flair.a good high flier follows that high flier with noble and tajiri.triple h and kane is a snoozer.since triple h sucks.then theres angle and benoit,who hate eachother vs ray jr and edge.its fun to watch little ray kick the crap out of that loser kurt angle.trish fights victoria next.thats fun.then brock lesnar goes into the hell in a cell with undertaker.this match earns the 3 star rating or it would have been only 2."
4,Overall this is a pretty good ppv,"Match 1 was Booker and Goldust vs Y2J and Christian,good match***.Match 2 was Torrie vs Dawn.One word SUCKED*.Match 3 RVD vs Flair.O.K. match,good effort***.Match 4 Noble vs Tajiri I realy like the cruserweights****.Match 5 HHH vs Kane I dont know why everybody hates this match.I thought it was great****.Match 6 Edge and Rey vs Angle and Benoit.Amazing*****.Match 7 Trish vs Victoria.Finnaly a good womens match***.Match 8 Brock vs Taker Hell in a Cell.Awesome.It was a blood bath*****.Overall,No Mercy was one of the better PPVs of 2002.I recomened it.Props to Brock and Taker.****"
3,No Mercy not as good as I thought,"This PPV wasn't that good. Very dissapointing. I thought it would be much better. Personally I thought it was one od the worst PPVs ever one of the biggest pop was hell in a cell match (worst I have ever seen) biggest boo was Paul Heyman and HHHI give it 1 thumb up , one thumb down, because I am nice"
2,"If your looking for action, go elswhere.","This movie is OK. A few laughs at best. If you want an action movie starring Chan, this isn't it. He has one lame fight scene, and that's it. Try drunken master 1 or 2, or Police story. Overall, Chris Tucker is funny for 15 minutes until all his material just repeats itself endlessly."
2,The little girl should've been railed,"This moive was just an excuse to have some mindless (hopefully enthralling)action and to show what a funny ...(actor) Chris Tucker is. I don't think it succeeded that well.Sure, Chris Tucker is funny. Ha ha. But there's gotta be a better venue for him to display it than this reeally lame plot with Jackie Chan who he has no chemistry with. I wouldn't mind a good mindless plot if they didn't keep reminding me, repeatedly, that the whole catalyst for the ENTIRE movie is to get back the ...little ...(chinese girl). And how they're ""doing it for the little girl."" That reeeally got under my skin. I mean, hey. Have a mindless movie, but don't dress it up like it's not.The action was okay, Chris Tucker wasn't as funny as I was led to believe, by numerous parties, he would be, and I walked away feeling dissatisfied....P>C, C-"
4,Not Jackie Chans best,"Yeah the movie is funny with the first time watching, but only for mainstream American audiences. All his best works are his Hong Kong films. Drunken Master, Drunken Master II, Police Story, Project A, Rumble in the Bronx. Those movies are his Master Works. Rush Hour is what it is, the most successful Black-Asian combination next to Tiger Woods."
5,Great comedy/action film,"This is an excellent film. I'm not sure whether it's primarily a comedy or an action picture; there's plenty of both. There's enough going on to induce video-game-English-syndrome, in which you tensely twist your body this way and that as you watch. :-) Chan and Tucker work well together and seem to enjoy doing so, which helps. I forget whether I first saw this in the theatre or on video, but I think highly enough of it that I bought it. Your mileage may vary, but you'll probably enjoy it quite a lot -- I recommend at least checking it out at the rental store."
3,Extremely funny but the story was such a cliche,"This is how I would evaluate this movie:Humor- A (so many scenes in the movie were hilarious)story- C (The story was too common!!! The daughter of a wealthy politician got kidnapped ""unexpectedly"" ( yeah, right!)by someone close to the family. It was quite predictable.Acting- B for Jackie Chan and A for Chris Tucker - Cris T. was extremely funny in this movie)"
2,"VERY FUNNY,BUT CHAN AND TUCKER DESERVE A BETTER STORY",TUCKER AND CHAN ARE TOO GOOD FOR A DUMB FORMULAIC STORY LIKE THIS. THEY SHOULD BE CASTED IN A BETTER FILM WITH A BETTER PLOT.
5,4.5 stars- Quite possibly Jackie and Chris at their best,"1998/'99 everybody saw this movie (don't lie) and knew that one of the best action movies around that time. The screen play is awesome, and the writers put together a dope plot and script Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan to act out. This is quite possibly the best that they have been (especially for Chris Tucker) in their acting careers. To me this is one of the movies I wouldn't mind watching again and again and again (even when it's on TBS). Almost perfect all around, I'd say the only fault was that the movie started a little slow, but it quickly picks up. I know you've seen this move, now buy it!"
5,It's a fantastic movie.,I would like to purchase the movie but I do not want the widescreen version. Is it available in the standard format.
5,THIS IS SO COOL!!!!!!! IT'S PACKED WITH ACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS CERTAINLY A SWEET ACTION/FIGHTING MOVIE!!!!! Jackie Chan HAS THE BEST MOVES!!!! THIS IS A ACTION THRILLER!!!!!!!!!!!! GET IT FAST!!! ALMOST AS GOOD AS WATERBOY!! ABOUT A TIE WITH GODZILLA!!!! GET NOW!!!! AGES(11+)
4,Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker make a great team.,"Lots of great stunts, it's Chan, would you expect anything less? Tucker fills in with the laughs and the chemistry is definatly there. I would recommend a widescreen version do to some scenes where you can't see both of there faces. Otherwise, excellent entertainment and Chan's best yet."
4,This movie was hilarious,"For people who like comedy and action, this movie is for you. Jackie Chan is an excellent and funny martial artist. Chris Tucker is funny just to look at. The professional martial artist in the movie is incredible."
4,Ingenious Casting Saves Formulaic Plot,"I can imagine the meat heads at New Line, thinking this one, coming up with ideas for a story, which to them seemed original, only because it takes ideas from other movies and throws them into one with a different title. But some genious came up with the idea of casting Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan together, a movie I never would have thought up in a million years, just because of how opposite they are. And you want to know something, it works. Chan is of course his usual charming, lightening fast self (although who only has one trademark ""use/save a prop"" fight scene) and Tucker is his, well, usual charming lightening fast self, as he talks his way through anything. A perfect, unlikely teaming which was wild fun.--wcg"
4,Chan is one incredible action figure!,"I love watching Jackie's stunts. Tucker talkes too much and Chan says little. More laughs than not! Lethal Weapon with more ""hi-yahs""!"
4,One of the funniest films of the 90's,"I've heard that people can't stand this film, and I have no idea why - I mean, sure, Chris Tucker gets to be a pain in the butt sometimes, but hey, it's funny! RUSH HOUR is a lot of fun. Jackie Chan gets to show off some kung fu, do some comedy, ""sing"" an Edwin Starr song, I mean, it's great! It really is a lot of fun. Come on - it's worth a rent!"
3,"Oh, Jackie...","The first American produced Chan film. And it's obvious. Perhaps you Jackie Chan ""fans"" out there forget that Jackie is a martial artist. Have you all seen his earliest films? Man did they suck! Nevertheless, this film was a bigger disappointment because I expected more. Where was the hand-to-hand action I love so much? What was with all the gunplay? If I wanted cops playing with their guns, I would've picked up a copy Terminator 2. But I wanted Jackie to beat down, and I got very little of that. Maybe it had more American-accepted dialog and I suppose Chris Rock...oops I mean Tucker...was an interesting choice for a costar, but I get the feeling that Jackie was being led on in this one. That's just wrong. Jackie should always have the upper hand and creative control in all of his films. We trusted him in Hong Kong, why don't we trust him here? Why do I feel the hand of the evil Hollywood Glamourizer pulling on the strings of the action? It just felt all wrong."
5,Classic Fun!,"I love this movie, and ever since I last saw it in VHS I wanted to have it in a better quality. This was the right choice. I really like it, and I can't stop having fun every time I see it. I don't get tired of it. For me, it's a classic movie with lots of action and lots of fun.I really recommend this movie for any Jackie fan!"
4,Chan and Tucker make a great odd couple team,"this is a pretty good movie.it's an action adventure comedy.there is alot of action and the movie is fast paced.there isn't a lot ofcomedy,but comedy bits there are,are pretty funny.Jackie Chan'sacrobatic,over the top cartoonish martial arts moves are funny.ChrisTucker's motor mouth character is pretty funny at times.also theteaming of Chan and Tucker is a great idea.they work well off eachother.one could not be more opposite from the other.i liked their backand forth banter.the other thing i like about this movie is that eventhough there is some violence,it's not excessive,and there is a bit ofcoarse language,but not very much.for me,Rush Hour is a 3.5/5"
3,oh my god its funny!!!,"im a big fan of jackie chan(rumble in the bronx) and even a bigger fan of chris tucker(money talks,friday)and together they make for a good movie."
5,It's great because it has comedy and action all mixed in to.,The movie is great. It has great action plus adds some comedy
4,One of Jackie Chan's best...,"Well, I've gotta say, I have a biased opinion of Rush Hour, cos i've always really liked Jackie Chan. But I do think that it was better than Mr. Nice Guy. Rush Hour had a good story line, with enough laughs to keep it a comedy, and enough action to qualify as a good action movie. If you want to see a great movie, rent Rush Hour. Most people will really like it."
5,WAR...HUH!...WHAT IS IT GOOD 4 ABSOLUTELY NAWTING!,"This is the funniest movie of 1998. Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan make have instant chemistry in the movie. I've been following Chris Tucker since ""Friday"" (a ghetto classic) and Tucker does not fail to bring the laughs. I laughed so hard at this film that I fell over and started crying. My favorite scene is in the bar when Jackie Chan ""greets"" the bartender -- then all hell breaks loose. LOL! Get it! And if you like this movie, I recommend ""Friday"" with Ice Cube & Chris Tucker."
4,funny and alot of action,jackie chan is great as usual. and he is also funny. chris t. was also funny. add action
5,Totally hilllarious!!,"Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker sure are hilarious in this movie, but I think that he should it easy down the stairs! Now Tucker, he is darn hilarious! But he also is has to take it easy on the punching, but overall he is a great actor like my friend Jackie!"
5,Rush Hour is one of the best recent comedys,I've ony seen Rush Hour 1& a half times but I have 2 friends that have seen the movie 50+ times each and they still laugh at it. You will NEVER get tired of this movie.
5,Man i love this flick,"These 2 make one of the funniest on screen duos i have seen. I must have watched this movie 15 times since i got it a month ago on dvd, only because the vcr ate my tape of it. I can't wait for the sequel. Even the outtakes are fantastic. One of the best buddy films made."
4,A good start,"This film is not a typical Jackie Chan movie. The action is sparse and very ""Hollywood"". However, unlike most Chan films this one is actually watchable. A decent plot and Tuckers humor brought this film to one of the top grossing films of the year with over 100 million in box office gross. With good performances by both Chan and Tucker this is a good starter for those who say they dont like Jackie Chan movies."
4,Movie was good... Tucker is a riot!,"I thought that the movie was good. Jackie Chan was Inspector Lee who gets called in to help find Soo Young a little Chinese Girl. Chris Tucker is Det. Carter who is forced to keep Lee out of the way so that the LAPD can try to take all credit for solving the case. But soon the 2 manage to work their way in to save the little girl.I thought that this one was much better then the sequel that came after. Chris Tucker had lots of Great one liners! ""This is the United States of James Carter now. I'm the president.. I'm the emperior, I'm the king... I'm Michael Jackson you're Tito!""The way Chan and Tucker play off each other is wonderful. So what if Tucker had problems with speaking Chinese... Jackie Chan still struggles with his english so I don't fault either one...There is a big docufilm about the movie along with a special game that you can play to help save the little girl... Please watch with an open mind... It is a lot of fun..."
3,East meets West,"In the style of Lethal Weapon, Jackie Chan goes Hollywood in this action comedy also starring Chris Tucker. The action is good, the dialogue is funny and the chemistry between Chan and Tucker is surprisingly good. However we don't see Jackie Chan at his best here, the storyline and Ratners direction don't allow him to be at his creative best and Chris Tucker does tend to get overly annoying in this film. Not as good as its sequel but does enough to satisfy all Chan fans and fans of action/comedy movies in general. Easy to watch over and over again, worth buying."
3,"GOOD, BUT CHRIS TUCKER'S VOICE IS ANNOYING","Chris Tucker thinks he is funny by shouting loud, he's not and his double standard racist jokes arent either. This aside, the film is quite good."
2,Not that great.,Chan is good; Chris Tucker is more than a little irritating. I don't think he's done much of anything since this came out in 1998. I can see why.
3,mindless fun,"Rush Hour 3 is not as good as the original Rush Hour, but it's not a bad movie, either. The plot's pretty simple, involving the finding of bad guys, which takes them to France, a fight on the Eiffel Tower, etc. Some good action scenes throughout and the usual humor. If you liked the original Rush Hour, you will probably like this one, too -- just not as much."
3,FORGET MY OTHER REVIEW,"THIS FILM HAS A DUMB AS SH*T PLOT AND HAS NOT AN OUNCE OF ORGINALITY IN IT,BUT THE PLOTS JUST AN EXCUSE FOR JACKIE CHAN AND CHRIS TUCKER TO TEAM UP AND IGNITE SPARKS AND LAUGHTER."
1,don't waste your time,"Don't waste your time with this one .... the casting is all wrong! Jackie Chan was superb as always, but his co-star - please! Sinbad would have given a much better performance than Chris Tucker. His grating voice and loud mouth approach to the role made this a difficult movie to watch, let alone justify spending money for pay-per-view or purchasing the video. Save your money for something better!"
2,Im sorry Jackie has just hit some bad films,"2 stars for the ""whatsup mynigger"" bit i couldnt even manage to watch this from start to finish.Im really hopeing that jackie will begin to make some good movies again like in the old days (Drunken Master 2, Project A and Armor of god)"
4,Plenty of high-kicking fun...,"""Rush Hour"" is one of my favorite buddy movies. It's also one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies. Let's face it: Jackie is the man. Without him, action movies [would not be the same]. It's thanks to his risky stunts and his goofy attitude that action films are where they are today. Now for Chris Tucker. Personally, I like him. I've seen him in other movies and I think he's funny. Other critics won't agree with me, but I think the guy is hilarious. In this film, the two play Carter (Tucker) and Lee (Chan), two cops on the search for a young girl named Sooyung (or something) who has been kidnapped and held for a ransom. We get the predictable buddy-cop movie cliches, but it's the humor and awesome stunts by Chan that makes this film a sheer delight."
4,The first good American Jackie Chan movie,"Yes, the action is diluted due to the fact that it is an American production and Hollywood just isn't as brave (crazy) as Hong Kong. Y'know what? Deal with it! Rush Hour is a great movie. It combines the action and character of Hong Kong and Jackie Chan with the style and comedy of America and Chris Tucker. What this movie lacks in action is made up for in laughs. The interaction between the cocky American and the out of place Chinese is hilarious as they put each other in their respective places. The success of this film has proven that Jackie Chan has his place set out in Hollywood."
5,Best of any other Jackie Chan movie while the most recent!,"In this movie, Chris Tucker must have been badly embarrassed. Jackie Chan always saves his tail. Anyone who watches this movie will probably laugh like crazy until he or she cries! Jackie Chan had really done it this time!"
5,"A movie that combines action and comedy, and comes on top!","This movie made me crack up. Chan's high-paced martial arts action and Tucker's smash comedy has combined in Rush Hour, one of the best movies, according to me. This movie had good acting and great combination. I surely want this one, and you should too."
2,Rush Away,Why was this such a big hit?. Why is it so liked by so many people?. It's tired and boring.
2,Same old stuff for Jacky Chen,"For those who are facinated by Jacky Chen's incredable stunts, well, here is a rude awakening. He's been doing that for more than 20 years, and as a person growing up with Hong Kong Kong- Fu movies, I can attest that most of his moves, his stunts, even the facial expressions, the innocent looks from Rush Hour are deja-vus from his earlier Chinese movies. The only difference is that Jacky in the 90s is much older,, and he did all his stunts while he was still young"
3,"Thumbs up for Chan, down for Tucker","For me, a little Chris Tucker goes a long, long, looooong way. Unfortunately, Tucker is very prominent in this movie, relegating Chan to the background much too often. So, this is my least favorite Jackie Chan movie. Jackie's great as usual -- but it's only half HIS movie."
5,:0),"how can you not like RUSH HOUR they have the prefect chemistryand chris tucker's funny bones shines through, jackie what can i say but good job......"
4,Chan and tucker make a great action-comedy team!,Rush hour was two hours full of great action and comedy. Chan and Tucker make a great team. I recomend this film to anyone who loves movies!
3,Quick Family Geneology,Service from the Amazon supplier was excellent.The book was very comprehensive but not complete.I did not find information on the Quick family from Centre County PA.I guess some Quick people did not respond to the authors questionnaires.
5,"Pioneers of Osborne County, KS","Book was sent quickly and packaged well.It contains much historical information and many interesting old photos. As in many such publications, it is not comprehensive in that the Shellenberger, Neuschwanger (the ones preceding the ones mentioned in the book) and the William Henry Stevens families do not appear.That being said, the attractive book has a well prepared text and it is very helpful in Osborne County, KS, research. Highly recommended!!"
3,wouldn't buy again,"Product was nice style..but fabric thin, shrunk to half its size after washing it .. gave it to much smaller person after first laundering. I would not buy this particular product again."
2,Make up your own ending,"I got interested in this movie and had to finish it. Good actors, good acting, good story and sympathetic characters. I had to finish this movie just to see these poor people rescued from that bone-chilling cold. And the daughter, sick, needing medical attention, ""reading"" from a diary she found.I wish someone could have warned me about the ending. So some people consider this ""arty?"" How someone could watch a movie like this over and over is beyond me but that is just my own opinion. If this film had an ending, a real ending, good or bad, I would give at least 4 stars. But I felt like I had been slapped in the face. Ha ha, the joke is on me.I hope to avoid films by this director in the future. I don't want to invest emotions in a film and the characters in it, only to be shut out, to have the door slammed shut in my face."
1,a glorified dime novel,What I did like was the great acting by Vanessa Martinez. It also gave you a little feel of Alaska-not easy to get unless you go there.
1,WHAT !,"LIMBO is so bad it made me angry. An absurd ambiguou ending, made due to the director's desire to make the film seem ""different"". Horrible pot, horrible acting. Skip it away!"
1,Aaaaarrrggh,"OK, I don't mind watching a 2-hour movie, and I regularly like the movies John Sayles makes, but it seems like he put this together with ""screw-the-viewer"" in mind. The way this movie ends is absolutely inexcusable."
1,Unbelievable!,"Actually, I wouldn't even give this movie any stars...I found it to be choppy, vague and unbearably boooooooooooring and what kind of ending was that...poor choices were made by those actors...I too was drawn by the cast. Don't waste your money or time."
4,Limbo,"This is the first film I've seen that really captures the true image of what an Alaskan fishing village is really like. The characters in the film were so much like the people that live where I live. I passed this film around town and everyone agreed! It was like watching our own town. the story starts out a little weak, but by midway thru you are gripped. My jaw dropped at the end! I sent this to all of my relatives in the lower 48. An excellent sleeper!"
4,SOMETHING ELSE,"Limbo is a fascinating movie - no Hollywood stuff, but independent film-making of very high quality. Most of all I like the two main characters played by David Strathairn and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. The way they get to know each other is very tender, very convincing, and also funny at times. I particularly like the scene in the bar when she comes to his table after singing a song, and they start revealing little bits about themselves to each other - that's fascinating acting, and fascinating dialogue too.As for the much-disputed ending - oh well, I don't want to give away too much, but director/writer/editor John Sayles says in his DVD commentary (highly recommended) that it was the only ending that seemed appropriate to him, and maybe he's right..."
5,Fabulous,"Limbo is a wonderful movie filled with great storytelling and characters. The more I thought about it, the more I loved it. The characters are memorable, including the ones you don't see. And, the ending is perfect, no matter what anyone says."
1,Don't Waste your time on this one.,"This was by far one of the most awful movies we have ever experienced. As ""deep"" as some may think this movie was, does take make up for the fact that it is simply a bore. Through the whole movie you are waiting for something even slightly interesting to happen and it never does. How this movie ended, made absolutely no difference. You are left feeling so uninterested in the movie itself that you really don't care how it ends. I wish I could get my rental $'s back."
1,i wish i could give this movie one less star,"This was terrible. We watch a lot of movies and i have to say this gors down as one of the worst. It introduces to the viewer about 20 characters in the beginning - for no real reason - since only 3 of them end up being in the movie. The acting was fine - but the movie is dull, dull, dull. The ending is stupid and it leaves one wishing they could have the last 2 hours back."
1,"HÁ, HÁ, HÁ!","Elizabeth Mastrantonio, the star of the good ""COLOUR OF MONEY"", accepted to play the role of a aging singer who sings only in night clubs and pubs. Since the start, we can see the script is a total mess. The songs she sings are plain horrible, but this is only a detail in a completely ridiculous production, that has inocuous characters, bad acting, bad direction, bad screenplay and a disgusting ending."
1,Awful Move; Cheaply Shot; Lacking A Story Line,"This is an awful movie. It is so cheaply shot it's a distraction. Whoever produced this move needs to go into another career. Awful story line, what little there is. Stay far away from this movie, it's 2 hours of your life you'll never get back but wish you could."
3,"Well, don't bother...","Although this movie held my interest, it had a horrible ending. I understand it was 'Limbo', The acting was good! ... But to go through a movie and not have a clue to the ending... BAD!!!... Most movies have the couple kiss, then wonder if they get married, etc. Or, the killer ends up alive, when you think they are dead. But this was a total shut out from the directors. Aweful... I am a movie freak, I know what I am taking about... but this was a good movie, until they pulled that 'shut out' at the end."
1,"HORRIBLE, A BAD JOKE !!!","The arroganc of this idea: turn a low budget film into a ""materpiece"", with deep thoughts, great characters and an ""enigmatic"" ending... Horrible movie, directed with lack of real will to make a good movie, a bad cast, a history that doesn't touch you the least ( at the middle of the film you don't even care the least for the child, Mastrontanio and the guy). THe ending was apparently made to insult and offend the viewer who paid to watch this garbage, or for the sake of the director saying to himself; ""oh, look at what a great film maker I am, what an original ending, what a ""different plot"" """". Blergh !! Keep away from this!!"
1,Hmm,"It is a shame that these excellent actors were in this movie. One of the reasons I rented it was because the actors in this movie are usually in pretty good movies. I suppose actors are entitled to one huge mistake.Go with the majority on this one, and save your money. I get the weird feeling here that any good reviews have been perhaps written by John Sayles himself... makes you wonder. I can't image what anyone would find even remotely interesting about this movie. If anything, it is very depressing. I'd have to agree with several previous reviews in that I feel robbed of several hours on this one."
1,THE most awful movie!,"I give this move a NEGATIVE 5 rating. Could this movie have been anymore boring? Sure the acting was good - but again, how boring it was almost painful! I watched this movie with a large group who also felt the same way - what does that tell you? Very dreary."
1,LIMBO is where this movie belongs to !!!,"Terrible picture. Bad acting (Mastrantonio singing is something unbeliavable, so bad it is), slow direction, no climax, absurd ending (or lack of it!). An indulgent film all the way, you sense the director is sure he is doing a masterpiece with low budget, but he is not! Strathairn saves himself, the rest is bad, man, really bad."
1,ATOMIC BOMB - TURKEY !!,"Don't be fooled by the unbeliavably generous reviews people have given to this garbage. This movie is horrible. THe ending is an insult and an offense to the viewer. THe acting is atrocious, so bad it is. A so-called ""art"" movie, that ended as a total failure."
2,No Doubt-Limbo is Disappointing,"No Doubt-Limbo is DisappointingAfter gathering with family in hopes of enjoying a good movie, we all left the 90+ minute investment in time disappointed.The movie rolled along in waves, and while some waves were better than others, the final wave crashed to the shore with belittlement and frustration.Many of the sub plots lead to unknown and unnecessary places, and the ending left one unfulfilled.This viewers humble opinion would be to wander to other sections of the video store, or simply walk out of the store empty handed."
2,Was my copy of this film was defective?,"Sorry, I suppose I'm not intellectual enough to appreciate a story without an ending. Before reading other reviews, I honestly believed my copy of the video was defective and that the tape had run out before the movie was over. Those who like this style must tear out the final chapters of their novels before reading them."
1,What? No zero star option?,"Can you say D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, D R A G, ad infinitum?"
5,Powerful and emotional movie,"Some have dissed the ending, finding it unsatisfying, but in my opinion, that's exactly what John Sayles wanted to accomplish with this ending, IMO.The people gave in to the situation and accepted their fate, good or bad.As many critics have pointed out, tension without resolution was built up and up throughout the movie. They claim that this was the mark of an incompetent director. I disagree.I believe that Sayers wanted to convey the feelings (frustration, resignation, hopeful/hopeless, etc.) of being in limbo to the audience. At least to me, he succeeded. The lack of resolution made for a much more powerful and emotional ending.Sayers could have made this movie an ""action packed thriller"" but did not. It must have been at least somewhat tempting to Sayers; given the box office appeal of ""action packed thrillers"" which probably would have made a lot more money."
1,Limbo,"Limbo, one of those ""creative"" movies without an ending, you hang in there for a two hour movie, too be totally let down at the ""finish"", I use the word finish, due to there is not an ending."
3,"Great movie, Just don't see Blu Ray","Where Eagles Dare is a great movie, but when you buy this in Blu Ray it doesn't come through.Bought Battle of the Bulge in blu ray and was amazed to see Robert Shaw & Henry Fonda in HD after all these years, but this movie looks no different than it does on vhs."
5,Great duo!,"Kelly's Heroes has to be one of the most entertaining and lighthearted WWII movies out there! I bought this for my husband for Christmas, but in all reality I bought it for myself! Love it! We are also Clint Eastwood fans, so you can't go wrong with either one of these films."
4,Kelly's Heros casting excellence,"All the main characters of this excellent film were cast and allowed to display their unique personalities. Years before ""Dirty Harry"", as only one example, but one can see Harry in Eastwood's role here. Donald Sutherland here plays a rag-tag tank commander but you can see his unique brand of humor we enjoyed in ""MASH"". Several similar."
4,Brought down a star for 'Kelly's Heroes'...,"'Where Eagles Dare' is top pulp action WWII with 'Kelly's Heroes' being dragged down by its era of which it was made. Hippies don't belong in a WWII movie!Outside of that, it sadly lacks much in the way of extras or visual improvements with barely minimal upgrades to to the Blu~ So I'd advise a purchase of the DvDs rather than this. Yes I did buy this in the hopes that the company would've done some better clean up for the visual, but was roundly disappointed for their blatant lack of care to it."
5,Kelly's Heroes/Where Eagles Dare action double feature blu-ray,The movies are great and you can not beat the price.I am glad to see alot of the old classic movies are making it to blu-ray.
3,Incomplete editions in both transfers.,"Kelly's Heroes and Where Eagles Dare had special blow-up prints for 70 mm presentations, including overture, intermission an exit segments, none of which are present in these Blu-Ray discs.Once in a while the inheritors of the MGM film library forget to do a proper research of the theatrical prints used for movies. We can see a clear example in all of the MGM cartoons for Tom & Jerry, where the soundtrack is subpar compared to the original tracks, and on many occasions the shorts were cut and never re-edited to their original content.Sadly, this is the case with these two BD-V discs, and all of a sudden we miss the chance to see those movies exactly as they were shown in the 70 mm theaters."
1,Audio Out of Synce,"Do not bother buying this until Warner Brother's comes out with a fixed version. The movies are great, the Blu-ray picture is great considering the age of the movies, but the audio is out of sync, most noticeably on Kelly's Heroes. Very annoying. I sent the first one back and got a replacement. Same issue. Great service from Amazon in quickly getting me a replacement, and taking the second one back."
3,Kelly's Heroes Blu Ray,Picture quality is great but the audio and lip movement is out of sync. I wish Warner Bros would have taken better care in making this DVD. I have this movie on regular DVD and the audio and lip movement is in sync.
3,Blu-Ray Review,"Kelley's Heros has an Audio Sync Problem just like Saving Private Ryan had only it is worse. Amazon is sending me a Replacement Order but I think it will have the same Problem since the Order was created right away.As far as the Blu-Ray goes, the 2 movies are somewhat of an upgrade."
2,Kellys Heroes a Bust.,"I have the DVD of Kellys Heroes and I could see almost no improvement on this ""Blue-Ray"" version. What did they do, just put the dvd copy on a bluyray disc? It's disappointing. And I don't want to hear about how it's an old movie and that's the best it can be. Hell, movies like To Catch a Thief can be upgraded on DVD to look better than a lot of Bluerays, so there's no excuse. Where Eagles Dare is a noticeable improvement over the DVD and the only reason to get this."
3,not for linux,"If you want a raid5 card that works with linux I highly recommend going with a 3ware product instead. After two weeks of struggling with this piece of hardware I returned it and bought a escalade 7506LP instead -- it may be $100 more but worth every cent. Promise claims to have linux support but it is sadly out of date and tech support is none existent (they never responded to my email inquiries). I'm giving this product 3 stars because I'm giving them the benefit of doubt and assume that it works as advertised with windows systems. But all linux users, stay away!For those of you who must absolutely save the $100, I highly recommend visiting the yahoo group sx4000linux to read about other user experiences and possible solutions to driver issues you will no doubt encounter. But good luck getting it to work with 2.6.x kernels....no open or closed source drivers."
1,Absolutely Awful,"The structure of this book was absolutely awful. The content even worse. This book has no clear storyline and jumps from pictures to uninspired text. It is mostly pictures, as if intended for a 1st grader. In summary, this book offers nothing of value."
1,horrible,"If you are looking for service this is NOT the product for you. My stove died after only 3 weeks. Upon contacting englander cust. service, or I should say WAITING to contact, 45 minutes on hold..........I was told I would have to do some re wiring. It was a fiasco to say the least. Thankfully I keep my paperwork and I returned it. Save yourself some frustration. This was not worth the powder to blow it away.I now own a breckwell. I would not recommend englander to my enemies."
1,very expensive boat anchor,"Purchased this model 25 pellet stove in 2009.Have had nothing but trouble from the start.Had a man from the place I bought it,come out and help me keep it going for the first 2 years but he is no longer able to help me now.It seems funny that if you call englander,you will be on hold for a hour,but if you email them they seem to get right back to you,that is until they cant tell you what is wrong,then you get no response.This stove has now been down for about 3 months.I have spent about 1000 on it in parts and labor.We live in the mountains of northern California and I am 70 years old and pissed off and cold.I am to the point of getting my attorney see what he can do.If anyone else want to get involved in a suit,let me know.I have bought things made in Japan that had better service.Chuck Darcy"
3,"Clymer Suzuki Gs500 Twins, 1989-2002: Service, Repair, Maintenance (Clymer Motorcycle Repair)",In the short time I've had the manual it has saved me quite a few s by allowing me to undertake simple tasks that I didn't previously know how to. Even a simple thing like changing bulbs on the instrument cluster became an easy task.
4,Almost worth every penny.,"I have been using the Super Saw for a month and love it.Setup was easy, but it does take some time to fine tune thesliding table. The saw is quiet, powerful and rock solid.More bang for the buck than the Dewalt. My only beef likemost people is the fence. I find it to straight and it doeslock securely, but the bubble has got to go. You spend moretime trying to adjust it than it's worth. I resort to usinga tape measure which I'm not to pleased with after spending (the money)."
4,Weekend woodworker,It's a good saw but I have to wounder if Jet rushed this one out the door. I found the sliding table difficult to install and even harder to adjust. The fence does not stay accurate very long so I found myself using the tape to double check often. Something I was trying to avoid. It is a stable soild saw and the motor seems plenty powerful. With some modifitcations and a new fence this will be my saw for a long time.
2,It wasn't my idea of quality,"I have read many of the other reviews, but I don't share their satisfaction. I bought the saw about a year ago, I use it weekly. The fence has not been as stable, straight, or consistant as I would have hoped. The table only has one slot, so my tenoning jig doesn't work properly. I agree the sliding table is very heavy, it is also difficult to align and mine is not very flat. The sliding table is not worth the extra money. I would put a few hundred extra into a cabinet saw and pass on this one in the future."
4,Excellent Solid Table Saw,If I were to use one word to describe this saw is SOLID. The next word would be precise. I got my Super Saw a week after Thanksgiving. Assembly was easy even for a single person. Although the sliding table wing was heavy. Set-up did take the greater part of a day to include a mobile base but after that it was smooth sailing. I was a bit disapointed that the way Jet beats DW's price is by not including a saw blade A bit underhanded for my taste but hey it is a slightly better saw than the DeWalt. So I got a Freud thin kerf 40 tooth blade. The combination is pure heaven. Cuts are precise and clean. The mitter works perfectly as delivered. The blade angles are exact. The micro-adjustment on the fence is not so precise I have to check and adjust with a measuring tape but the fence is true and parallel. Power is more than enough.I look forward to years of solid performance as I know this saw is very capable to deliver.
1,"If you like Covey, don't buy this DVD","I am a very big fan of Stephen Covey, his writings, and especially the 8th Habit. The book is excellent and I recommend it to anyone. The Live DVD is, I hope, Covey's worst live performance ever. He looked uncomfortable and nervous like he was struggling to remember his text, some of his slides were written incorrectly from the book version, his clip mike appeared to not be working so he was awkwardly grasping a hand held microphone that looked ridiculous, and the performance overall was poor. I was also surprised at what they chose to use as a quick 35 minute version of the lecture. It was not as coherent as it could have been. If you have ever seen Covey speak live or seen it on video, this is not the man you have seen before. I am still not sure what was wrong - off day, not comfortable presenting the new material, or if I am overly critical. It was a big surprise and a big disappointment. Buy the book, skip the DVD, and hope this was an anomaly."
4,Thought it was pretty good ...,"I'm not sure if Covey was off, or not, this DVD was my first introduction to his material. I thought there were several stories and concepts in here that were motivational/inspirational and that definitely moved me to think about what I was/am doing in my life. It seems this is an abridged version of the book, but the points are definitely made and definitely well taken. I especially liked the four assumptions for your mind, body heart and soul, and his telling of a story at sea, an allegory that appears in the naval manual."
1,not made for large dogs,"This back pack definitely doesn't work for larger or stronger dogs. The straps are made of a cheap material that easily stretches and doesn't stay tight. I wouldn't use this as a primary lead, as it will very easily loosen or tear."
5,Great MIP handbook,"This book provides the basis of integer programming and mixed integer programming. It focus on the mathematical programming to discuss the combinatorial optimization, not the graph theory way.For the introduction level, Wolsey's book is better."
5,"If you enjoy Edward Abbey, this is as good as it gets!","All of the material in this cassette is available elsewhere, but nowhere else can you hear the intonation, humor, and on occasions rants of Cactus Ed in his own voice. I have played this for friends who have never heard of Abbey and universally comment that they have never heard anything quite like it. Whether he's drinking with pigs in the desert, musing on planting a tree under the nuclear umbrella, or playing cat and hiker with a puma, there is wisdom and absurdity in every spoken sentence. If they ever get another copy and you beat me to it - mine has worn out - you have won a real prize."
3,Hit or Miss,"This is an entertaining firsthand account of Abbey's adventures as he travels through some of the most remote and beautiful locales in the world. The first chapter, in which he travels through Australia, is by far the most entertaining, and Abbey's wit really shines here. He also makes strong arguments throughout the book about why preserving beautiful natural areas is so important. Some of the subsequent stories come off as so much fluff, in which Abbey is trying to find events of significance and/or peril in the face of a mundane trip. The events seem to me to be interesting enough without having to be dolled up."
4,Vintage Abbey,"This collection of previously published magazine articles is vintage Abbey, alternatively moving and funny, sacred and profane, flip and dead serious (well almost) and at all times entertaining. Divided into three categories - Travel, Polemics and Sermons, and Personal History - the subjects range from the Great Barrier Reef to technology to women to Winnebagos to hallucinogenic drugs - with many stops in between. The introduction, wherein Abbey comments on nature writing - and various nature writers - is itself worth the price of admission."
1,Cheap Material!,I bought one these handgrips and it broke after only about 1 month of light use. It makes a lot of noise and is made from cheap plastic material. Do not waste your money on it. You get what you pay for!
5,one of Dolphs best and well worth watching!,This film is a very good action movie and for a Dolph film has quite a good storyline. The action scenes are lively and the film wasn't overloaded with action scenes otherwise it would have ruined the overall feel. Dolphs performance is first rate and the rest of the cast are excellent even the annoying Cockney bad guy who although was cheesy he was good to watch. All in all this is a quality action movie that far outshines others in the B-movie genre.
4,Probably Dolph Lundgren's best movie........,"Don't have anything bad to say, Dolph Lundgren did himself proud with this one. Great location shots, good directing, good script, good acting and top notch action sequences. Probably the highest production standards a Dolph Lundgren production will ever see again."
2,"Misleading title, excercise caution.","The book title is misleading. The title should include""....in 1/48 Scale."" That is the only scale this Vol. in the Osprey Modeling series addresses. There is no mention of any of the other scale kits on the market. With this said, if you enjoy building one quarter scale ""Jugs"", you might rate this book higher that I did. The book outlines almost step by step building of all the currently popular 1/48 scale kits. There is little discussion of which kits are the best, but once chosen for the project the flaws of that kit are pointed out for correction. This includes sanding down the raised wing sections of the Academy 47D kit. I don't know about you, but my inclination is to start with a better kit. Yes, there are good model construction instructions to follow and learn from but you can get a lot of these ideas from other how to books."
2,THIS IS A CD THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SUPER BUT IT FAILED.,WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CD I EXPECTED A JEWEL BUT I WAS FOOLED. THE SELECTION OF SONGS WAS GREAT BUT NOT THE ARRANGEMENTS. WHO EVER DID THE ARRANGING SEEMED TO LIKE TO USE PERCUSSION BECAUSE EVERY SONG HAS IT. I THINK IT MESSED UP THE EFFECT OF THE SONGS. ON THERE SECOND CD LESS PERCUSSION WAS USSED AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE A BETTER SOUND.
1,Not up to the usual quality,I have other Chumbawumba CD's and really like them. This is the first clunker. The audio quality is poor...that or they group just has a bad case of the mumbles. Buy X or WYSIWYG but I think this one is a turkey.
5,shhhhh? ... nah!,"funny... the title doesn't match to this record. chumbawamba is shoking in many ways. but the most shoking is their attitude toward music making. shhh is definately very experi-mental(ly ill?) and really a big fun! i know a better record of theirs and namely: ""Anarchy"" - that's smashing!"
3,A word of advise,"The reality is that there are many recording out therewith music of Gottschalk all claiming to be ""As Gottschalk'smusic really sounds"" and the truth is that none of them do,they all fall short of the claim: ""As Gottschalk's musicreally sounds"". In the symphony # 1 "" A Night in the Tropics""the second movement actually sounds more like a 20th centurySalsa rather than a Danza which is what Gottschalk probably hadin mind. As far as sound goes, the music is pleasing to themodern ear, it sounds good, and is well arranged."
4,Gottschalk Symphonies,"This was evidently a rather old CD. The inside of the jewel case was broken so that the two CDs just rattled around. But, that didn't affect the quality of the music or the recording. The delivery was prompt and the CDs were well packaged."
3,White-Man-Runs-Him,"My great-great grandmother was Whiteman Runs Him's sister, so I probably know more about the subject of the book than most. However, I am not calling myself an expert in any way. I found the book to be factual and pretty well written. It is very clear that most of the two authors research centered around interviews with my grandfather Joseph Medicine Crow (who is also credited as an author of the book). Dr. Medicine Crow is the Crow Tribe's historian and probably the only living person who heard Whiteman Runs Him speak in person about the events of his life. All that being said, the style of writing the authors employed was rather sterile and lacked excitement. I surely recommend this book to all for the factual content but cannot rate the book overall any more than 3 stars due to the somewhat boring way the book was written. Reading this book is much like reading a school text book, not all that entertaining but full of information."
1,mislabeled,"I'd been drinking the Maxwell House French Roast Decaf for several months when it disappeared from my local store. I was so happy to see the product offered through Amazon, but it just isn't the same. It doesn't smell or taste like French Roast. I'm convinced that it's mislabeled."
5,An extraordinary travelogue of a classic American road trip.,"When a review copy of Dayton Duncan's ""Out West"" arrived in the Ohio newsroom where I worked in the mid-1980s, I snagged it and devoured it within days. I knew right then I'd have to make the trip myself someday. When I got the chance to write a guidebook to the trail in the early 1990s (""Traveling the Lewis & Clark Trail,"" also available via amazon.com), ""Out West"" rode shotgun with the Lewis & Clark journals on my pickup seat. ""Out West"" is among the best American road books ever written, full of insight about the Lewis & Clark Expedition and how America has changed in the 200 years since then. From Duncan's ""road rules"" to his insider tips on the best cafes and most colorful characters along the way, you can't go wrong going ""Out West"" with Dayton Duncan."
1,Description is incorrect,"The description states that it will fit 2 1/2 dia exhaust pipe but the description is wrong, it does not fit 2 1/2 exhaust pipe. The ID of the tip is 2 1/4""."
5,A great album from an artist with true star quailty,"Many people tell me that this album is Ayumi Hamasaki's worst, but I don't really agree. None of her albums are bad. RAINBOW stands out as her experimental album, she has tried different new styles with this album such as R'n'B.I recommend all songs on this album, but some songs sticks out. Such as Voyage, Real me, July 1st, Independent and Heartplace.I may say that many songs on this album aren't the best - Ayu can deliver better songs, but the songs does satisfy me. If you already are an ayu fan, be sure to get this album straight away! If you are new to Ayu, try something like A BEST before you buy this."
5,Awesome Ayu!,"I love this album it is my favorite out of all 33+ that she has made, with the exception of My Story, which I am planning on purchasing."
2,"ordinary, ordinary, ordinary.....","Having read some of the other reviews here, it appears some people have approached this album with a pre-conception of what they think Japanese culture is, and so their reviews can be discounted at the outset. That having been said, tho', this album is just plain boring. Experimental, yes, but so was Rush in the mid-70's, and no-one listens to that anymore. Musically dull (live, both Nomura & Enrique look bored), and lyrically it lacks the fire that was on previous albums, like she just churned it out in 5 minutes to fit the music.This would not be a good introductory album for a new fan to buy."
2,Not as advertised,"I ordered this for my kindle, but didn't get the Cambridge edition advertised, but a different, simpler mobi edition. The text is riddled with typos, which makes it difficult to read in places. On the other hand, you do get the Two Treatises for .99 cents."
4,"LOGICALLY INCORRECT, BUT VERY INSPIRED","J.L's theories of government and rights gave inspiration to the notion that people are ""equal"" which is a meaningless concept, but inspires in the same way that a flag may inspire. If the notion is taken too far, it becomes dagerous. Spinoza's concept of rights in his brief work on politics and theology is much more valid logically, though not inspiring in the same way."
3,Review of Laslett's 'Two Treatises',"I'm a bit torn on this edition of Locke. On the one hand, it begins with an excellent and extensive introduction speaking to Locke's biography and political theory. There is even a theory that directly relates the works to Hobbes. Further, the text is supplemented by clear and copious footnotes.However, because Laslett decided to keep faith with the original printing, the text is filled with awkward, archaic spelling, punctuation and patterns in capitalization. This only adds to an already difficult language of the 'Treatises.'So, again, great introduction and footnotes, but a transparent presentation of the original writing detracts from this otherwise fantastic edition."
1,Worst edition of any book I've ever seen.,"This edition of Locke's masterpiece is filled with flaws. I've noticed these after only a few minutes of inspection: In the first place, it's falsely advertised (the title is TWO Treatises of Government, but it only includes the second). Second, it's supposed to be Two Treatises of CIVIL Government. Third, the format is awkward for a book like this. Fourth, There are no footnotes at all (not even translations when Locke cites non-english quotes). Fifth, there's no introduction. Sixth, there's almost no publishing information at all. Seventh, there are cheesy advertisements in the back. And finally, one of those ads has a typo.On the plus side, the cover is nice, and it seems to be loyal to the original text (I only glanced at it (and still noticed all those flaws)), but this edition is God-awful in almost every other way."
1,Kindle Version,"The Kindle version of this book is horrible. There is no Table of Contents. I had to hit ""next page"" hundreds of times to search through to try to find the Second Treatise which is all I need right now. I thought this was a deal at $.95, but was a waste of even that small sum of money. Is there a way to get a refund on a Kindle book?"
1,Yikes,This is one of those listen to it once and throw it in the closet until you find it three years later then laugh and throw it in the garbage cause you know it's trade in value is about 50 cents and not worth the bother.I was expecting a new take on Vivaldi;instead it was a journey into the deep as a rain puddle new age hokum.
4,sticks,"good sticks, good price, really happy they came on time so no complaints. promarks rock ive been using them for a while and they haven't missed a beat."
2,Barely ok,"Seeing all the glowing 5 star reviews, I bought some to replace my Vic Firth 5As.These Pro-Marks are skinnier, lighter and don't feel as balanced. Not only that, one stick was slightly out of true (slight bend near fat end of stick).I'm going back to Vic Firth 5a. What the heck was I thinking."
5,Algebra 2 Practice Workbook with Examples,"I was not even aware that this book existed. Found it on Amazon and it matches perfectly with the course. Great price, quick shipping"
1,No solutions. Book is a waste,How is one to know they are learning/progressing if they can not check their solutions? This book is a waste. Now i've got to buy something that has the solutions.
4,nice,"I ordered it for alegbra 2 and I must say, the workbook has nicely compiled exercises for each chapter/section in the book."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I believe that it should be clearly stated, maybe even in the title, that this book doesn't have an answer key. But does anyone know where I could get one? I have the textbook, this workbook, but now I need the answers to the workbook. Help please?"
4,Price is Right,"Short book, small price. This is a quick read, with lots of illustrations and a load of information about Systems Thinking. I read it in a couple of hours, for class (required to read it before the first class). I highlighted some items, and referred to it until I got the terminology down."
4,A great MOVIE,This movie was great at every thing Alicia Silverstones's best movie so far.I love it I already pre-ordered it on DVD.GREAT MOVIE...
5,I was very satified,I was so happy to find an unused copy of this film. The seller enclosed a very nice note to contact him if I was unsatified. I was very satified with this transaction
5,Comedy At It's Best,"This movie is the best romantic comedy ever made by far. The script is excellent and that is elevated by it's all star cast including Brenden Fraser, Alica Silverstone, all time veterens Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacak. For most of you Guys out there who think it's a ""Chick Flik"" it's NOT, let me give you an exsample I was with a group of friends one night, both guys & girls, and we all watched it and it was a hit i don't one person who didn't like it which just go to show you this movie is truly a great flick."
4,Pretty good - at least it has a twist,"I thought this movie was good because it was a new idea, Fraser is Brilliant, I'm a fan of Alicia Silverstone and she didn't do that bad (though she's better in Clueless) and the sets are authentic and well done. I also liked the way they showed the ground above the shelter changing over the years."
2,I've seen much better romance in other movies!,"When I saw this ill-friendshiped movie, I couldn't belive at how bitchy Alicia was to Brendan in this so called feel-good movie. What also surprised me was how Brendan never said or did anything to get back at her for how mean she was to him. It sucked in romance, love, and even friendship. And what romance!?, they didn't strip a single shirt when they french-kissed. The only thing I really liked about this movie was Christopher Walken, he's such a great actor! Anyway, Alicia basically verbally slaughtered Brendan from beginning to end, how disgusting! It was like she was on PMS throughout the entire movie! I felt sorry for Brendan Fraser..."
1,not funny at all,"when i was about to rent this,i was looking forward to a hilarious movie but when i saw this,i was really dissapointed.this movie was so boring.dont get this if your looking for comedy,this movie should be in the ""dumb"" section."
1,Terrible,Blast from the Past is one of the worst films I've ver seen. I tried to watch is several time and it would not keep my attention it was so poor. Finally i forced myself to watch the whole film and was dumbfounded at how Hollywood would actually allow this film to be produced. Don't waste you time on this jumk!!
4,Good Movie,"Not Oscar material but still enjoyable. Love the premise of spending all those years underground, then returning to see what has changed."
4,Cute story,"Like the story and how it plays out. A funny story regarding time, past to current. Recommended for all ages to watch."
4,very sweet,"purchased a dvd player awaiting ""the mummy"" & found ""blast from the past"" as a good example of what a dvd can do. this came in both widescreen and letterbox version. the movie itself was just swell--one can enjoy this movie with the whole family. brendan fraser is a joy to watch on the big or small screen. have always been a fan of both sissy spacek and christopher walken. if you can not purchase this -- at least go rent it. someday when bj is accepting an academy award -- we will remember him in these kinda parts he does so well. sit back and enjoy."
5,movie,"Excellent movie. Alicia Silverstone looks extremely hot. One of Brendan Fraser's better movies. Funny, heart, and warming. I would highly recommend warching this."
4,Fun trip into the past,"Humorous look at what it was like to live in the 50's. Remember the fallout shelters?I first saw the video with a group of friends at one of their houses. We were all in that age group and laughed throughout the entire movie. Younger folks might find it a bit too corny - kind of a ""had to be there"". Wanted to share it with some other friends and my kids (in their 30's) but couldn't find it anywhere - even to rent. Thanks to Amazon I now own it. Great cast!"
5,Love this movie :D,"This movie came in a timely manner, well packaged, and with no signs of defects. Great price, and a great movie. If you have seen this movie already, like I have, you probably got it for the same reason I did. This movie is awesome!!! :D:DIf you have not seen this movie, I recommend it if you like silly goofy movies. It's not a newer movie, so I know for some people, older movies are harder to get into if it's your first time seeing them. :)I am a mother of 3, ages 4 and 2 year old (almost 3) twin boys. The boys laugh at some goofy parts of the movie, and my 4 year old girl sits next to me and watches some parts, but they don't sit still for the whole movie. :) The most they've watched with me is probably 30-45 minutes of it, and that's if I give them pop corn :DThis is a great family movie to add to a collection, in my opinion."
5,Blast from the past.,Great movie. The actors were a perfect fit. I love how it related to how people thought in the past.
1,This is a movie that Blast it's way to the Past,This is one of the worst movie I have seen. Not only is it's story line bad but so are the actors. Brendon Fraiser and Alicia Silverstone play ADAM & EVE ( lol ) and The plot stinks. Its terible!
4,good for the prudish people too,"Something I could show with my Mom in the room, plus I really loved it."
3,Blast fron the past,All and all a good movie. Brendan dose a good job pulling off an idiot with Zero social skills! It was worth the rent. Won't rent it again!
3,Not widescreen!,"Buyer beware! If you are looking for a widescreen edition, Amazon apparently does not have it. I purchased this DVD specifically because it listed widescreen format. Upon delivery I noticed it was fullscreen and promptly contacted Amazon. They allowed me to return it, but said they did not have control over what this seller was listing."
3,Dave Foley is a Blast,I recently saw this film and agree that it is a cute family flik but I would not recommend it for adults looking for a hardy laugh. I have given this movie a decent rating due to the fact that David Foley was outstanding as usual and he made the movie very enjoyable.
3,"Cute, Cuddly, and Authentic","Blast Brom the Past Starring Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone is a refreshing film that throws together the ideals of the modern day fast past skepticism of the American dating scene with the idealistic, honest, and trusting Blast From the Past. The two morals mesh well together, and are backed up by an all star supporting cast. So, grab a date and a bowl of freshly baked popcorn; or no date and a bowl of your favorite ice cream; sit back and enjoy Alicia and Brendan in this underated gem."
5,Brendan Fraiser is HOT,Hottie Brendan Fraiser and Alicia Silverstone are great together in this comedy that is fun for all. Brendan's charaicter is convicingly humorous and Alicia's has just the right amount of jaddedness to bring him into the 90's. DVD extras are worth it too!
4,Great escapist comedy...,"I have now seen this movie 5 times and I enjoy it more each time! Pure escapism, always leaves me feeling great. Highly recommended for anyone who is sick of shoot-em-up movies and just wants a good laugh."
1,"movie 5, dvd software 0","both of us love the movie on vhs so ordered this dvd. probably plays fine on dvd player but we want to use pc. the dvd requires that you load 'pcfriendly' software and it wont load unless you allow it to download a bunch of other stuff. if you choose no it crashes and the uninstall also fails because a file is bad. this is not good and very upsetting. it was cheap so no big loss, just fair warning."
2,"Good Premise, But...","Interesting concept, solid performances from Walken and Spacek, and a very funny cameo character in the form of a malt shop/bar owner turned mystic. But that's it. The main character's return to the service never delivers on the comedy and the complications one anticipates. And he and Silverstone never really click. Light, entertaining, will not offend, but doesn't live up to its potential. In addition, the first half-hour is somewhat adult, pleasantly so, while the rest of the film is somewhat juvenile, irritatingly so."
3,Funny but forgettable.,"Blast From the Past starring Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Sissy Spacek, and Christopher Walken is a funny and interesting film but I haven't got a clue what happened at the end of the film, which makes this feature unmemorable. Great acting and plot but this film didn't grab right away, some of the dialogue is a bit corny. This film isn't horrible just not brilliant."
4,Zany and Entertaining,"Very enjoyable movie about a paranoid Father who is afraid of nuclear war, and the collision of errors that sends his family into a bomb shelter for 30 years. It is heartwarming, funny and romantic all rolled into one! And the Dad, he never learns!"
5,A Five Star Hit - Write that down!,"First off, ""Blast From the Past"" has a sterling cast - Christopher Walken plays oddball like no one else, Sissy Spacek is delightful as the ""Suzy Homemaker"" of the 1960's, Brendan Fraser is the son I always wanted, and Alicia Silverstone turns in a perfect street-smart-girl-goes-happily-ever-after performance. Then the writing is sharp and witty and just plain funny. The degradation of San Fernando Valley from 1962 to 1997 hits all the low points. This movie should be a permanent part of anyone's home DVD collection - ""Write That Down!"""
5,Everyone should see this one,This has long been my favorite movie. Anyone at almost any age can enjoy this one. I couldn't find it in stores for the longest time. I'm so happy to own it now.
5,"I love this movie. Simple, interesting idea. Very entertaining and funny.","I love this movie. Simple, interesting idea. Very entertaining and funny. Chrisopher Walken is awesome in a non-scary way."
4,Good comedy,"When an intelligent inventor mistakes a plane crash for 'the big one' in the 1960's and hides out in the bomb shelter he built below his house, not everyone is thrilled. His wife dearly misses the 'world above' and his son, who grew up in the shelter, is curious to go see what's up there...but he's really out of touch. When the father finally does go above, he thinks the fallout has created mutants (transvestites, garbage eating bumbs, gangbangers, etc.)This is a good comedy, a little corny in some areas, but very entertaining. All the actors portray their characters realistically.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,too much jazz and not enough house,"I have the first two of this series and both are regulars both by the pool and after dinner with friends. They are fantastic. I put all four on in a row and they provide consistantly good music either background or upfront depending on the volume set. So I bought this one as soon as I saw it. It isnt as good as the others. CD1 takes forever to find a groove. Too much fluttery flute and dischordant sax for me. Deep grooves with a sax or flute on top that doesnt seem to meld with the beat is not chill, it is distracting. There is some good stuff in there, but a mood making cd to play all the way thru, it is not...."
5,The last Chill house on the market. Bring on more please!!!,"As an Ibiza lover and Cafe del mar chill house session, this is a must have to the entire collection of 5 cds. You will not regret to have them all for your sunworshipping hours and your friend's tasteful house for hours to play."
5,"May the powers that be, release a DVD of this awesome movie!","I checked out this VHS tape from my local library in the winter of 2002 and watched the movie for the first time. I liked it so much I shared it with family and friends. Each year I check it out again, unfortunately, the tape is wearing out and I am afraid that I will not be able to purchase a DVD copy for myself before the library's gives out totaly. I hope we have a chance to get a DVD version soon!"
1,Poor video quallity,"While the content of this film is excellent, my comments are directed to the quality of this video. It appears that the entire miniseries was recorded in super long play, cramming 6 hours of play on a 2 hour tape. As a result the picture and sound quality is extremely poor. Beware."
5,The best movie of all time,"The 'A Town Like Alice' miniseries has been my favorite movie and miniseries of all time since I first saw it on PBS in the early 1980s. Everything about it is top notch from beginning to the end 5 hours later. A rich rewarding experience you must see again and again. I was extremely fortunate to tape it during an early broadcast then many years later a commercial VHS was released. I have three copies on VHS but they're getting old and I fear will be unplayable in the future. Like everyone else here reviewing A Town Like Alice, I've been waiting years for it to be released on DVD. This time I'm hopeful it will happen since Amazon is now taking email addresses to notify if a DVD is released. Maybe that's because the new movie Australia is generating interest.One way or the other you must see this treasure!"
5,"Please, pretty please!","In case the earlier reviewer is correct about marketing research, I am adding myself to the list of those who anxiously await the DVD of this masterpiece. I too continue to check Amazon on a regular basis."
3,Half Way Through on a Work Night,I had neglected to notice the length of the single video movie until it was too late. Be forwarned: it's a whopping five hours. Who knew?
5,"Absorbing drama, not to be missed!","An absorbing adventure, romance saga sweeping several continents and decades, reuniting lovers who first met during WWII when both were captives of the Japanese. Full of historical detail and fascinating glimpses of Malasian, Japanese and Austrialian ways of life and characters. A wonderful ending - terrific story."
1,a town like alice,"i received only the one video and there are two. so i only have half of the movie. this was not explained in the ad. so, not very happy and still need 2nd part of the movie."
5,DVD FOUND!!!,"I just purchased the 3DVD set from [...] It doesn't come with a case (the studio never released it) and the DVDs are stamped with the title ""A Town Like Alice""... if you aren't fussy about the extras and just care about having this movie on DVD then buy it there! The quality of the picture is just as good, if not better, than the VHS tapeS; plural (not the single VHS recorded on EP, but the 3 set VHS tapes - the good ones!)Oh, the price for all 3 DVDs is $19.99 plus $3.00 shipping. Hope this helps!"
5,I will watch this many more times. Romantic and classy!,"This movie version of the very popular book of the same name is a winner. First I read the book, and then I found the movie through Amazon. We are all waiting for the DVD! Bryan Brown and Helen Morse are wonderful actors and bring so much to the story. My husband left after the first five minutes because it is a little slow moving at first, but once you get to the part where Jean recalls her time during the war, you get drawn in and start to care so much about the characters. SO HANG IN for a few minutes!"
2,Rip off,Ordered and paid for the item. Never arrived. Amazon has done nothing. Seller doesn't communnicate.Buyer beware.
3,A disappointment after the book,"I was surprised at the high ratings here. I know not many movies ever compare favorably to the book, but in this case the story was changed. In the book Jean and Joe wait until they're married to have sex, Jean is a strong woman who doesn't have to be told about Australian ways, the rescue of the man with the broken leg is much more important. I also thought the acting in this movie was wooden at times and that the music didn't fit the story or the time."
