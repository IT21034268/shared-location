4,better than comcast HD-DVR,"I got this to replace a comcast HD-DVR and have been very pleased so far. It seems more responsive, e.g. when fast-forwarding. The TiVo menus are different than comcast; some parts are better than others. I like the TiVo suggestions; there is always something to watch."
4,TiVo Series 3 HD,"The Series 3 is a great DVR. I purchased this when TiVo was giving $200 cash back, which put the final price within $100 of the standard HD TiVo. For that price I couldn't pass up the extra storage space, OLED front panel and back lit remote. Being able to see the name(s) of the show(s) recording on the front of the unit it really nice.The TiVo interface is pretty good. It's still got some quirks to it that I'm surprised haven't been rectified by now. But, overall, it's the best game out there. FWIW, I think the old Ultimate TV interface was the best I've ever used.Being able to transfer shows back and forth to my computer, and stream from the computer to the TiVo is also awesome and works extremely smoothly."
4,TiVo Easy,"TiVo has never failed me. great product and makes me want more. I believe TiVo continues to get better then earlier days, and earlier days were nice."
5,Best DVR Ever,"I love my series 3. The front display is really cool in that it shows the Season pass programs that are recording on the front panel. You have separate lights for each tuner and another blue light when transfering programs. Fast menus, good response. Awesome remote. The back lit remote is really cool. Nicer button layout than the standard remote. Downsides, it does not yet support M-Cards, and the unit seems to have trouble syncing the audio with my TV when using the HDMI cable. (Although, my DVD player does too)."
1,Brand new TiVo was DOA (Dead on Arrival),"I received this item from Amazon, unpacked it and plugged it in. The result was the the item would not even power on. I would have returned the unit to Amazon but I called TiVo and they mistakenly told me to return it to them. Unfortunately, I received a refurbished unit in return. This was not Amazon's fault, but the fact that the first unit received from them did not even power on is the reason for the low rating."
1,Unreliable and will not work with Time Warner Cards,"I was very excited to receive the new Tivo. However after Amazon's prompt shipment the nightmares begun. It is extremely unreliable when it comes to networking (either PC or Mac). It took a week of constant chatter on the Tivo Forum to finally get it to work semi-reliably. I was willing to go with that, but the Time Warner came by to install the cards. Actually the installation went fine, however after we powered up the TivO we discovered that 95% of my HD channels could not be received. A call to Time Warner confirmed that their Cable Cards will not work with the Tivo and will only receive about 5% of the HD channels. So what good does it do to have a sophisticated device that won't work with the service I pay for. I am now in the process of returning the Tivo, canceling the cable cards and hopefully get Tivo to honor their 30 day warranty."
1,Think twice,"The TIVO HD is a piece of junk. It's sluggish, channel changes are slow, and the Internet features work poorly.What's worse: I bought it, returned it, canceled the Tivo service (if you don't call to cancel they will keep charging you $14/mo!), but they kept charging me even though I haven't owned the hardware for 5 months! I called to cancel again months later and they want to charge me a $150 early termination fee. For what? They gor their hardware back 5 months ago and I'm paying for nothing! Avoid. Go with DirecTV HD DVR!"
4,"Tremendous, with two flaws.","The TiVo is one of those very few revolutionary products that completely change how I interact with media. For me, it's the Macintosh, the iPod, and the TiVo.The Series three is expensive, but it's worth it. It's ease of use, dual-tuners, and HD support just rock the house.Negatives:1) No transferring to other TiVos in the house. Boo.2) External SATA port isn't working yet. This will be HUGE when they push out the software upgrade that activates the port. You'll be able to buy an external drive and double / triple the available TiVo hours.3) Unless you buy Toast 8, I don't know of any way to have officially support Tivo-to-Mac transfers (which only work from TiVo 2s anyway).Rock on."
5,Better than your cable DVR,"I've been a Tivo subscriber since just about day 1. We had the series 1 with the lifetime, then upgraded to the series 2 from there. Unfortunately we missed out on the upgrade to the Series 3, but for only $7 it was too hard to pass up.We turned in our Scientific Atlanta 8300HD to Comcast and got this unit. We use it on a Sony 52"" LCD and I have to say the picture quality is so much clearer. Sports show don't pixelate so much. The HD channels are even more so. You will have to rent cablecards (2, dual tuner) from your cable company. Unfortunately they will have to install them to get them turned on. Make sure your tech knows what he is doing.All the TIVO options are still there with a few extra gadgets and such.A $[...] mail in rebate didn't hurt either. Amazon was the lowest price around by far. Excellent product."
5,Everything you want and MORE!,"This is now our 4th TiVo box, and they just get better and better! We have had the DVR's from Cox Cable in New Orleans, Dish Network, and Comcast in Orlando, FL, and NONE compare to the ease of use or the available support of the TiVo. We have been die hard TiVo users for years, and our only wish in the past, and what got us to use other's DVRs, was the desire for dual recording. With the Series 3 and built in dual CableCards, this is EVERYTHING we want!"
5,I love my Series 3,"I was a long time Tivo Series2 user before upgrading to a Series3 to accompany my new HDTV setup. The Series3 takes the Tivo experience to a whole new level!The support for dual cable card tuners is a dream. Now I have access to all my premium cable channels, including HD, without the complications and channel-change latency of an external cable box.Only caveat is that after 7 months of trouble-free use, the hard drive failed. On the plus side, when I called into TiVo support with my problem, they shipped me a refurbished replacement unit overnight!"
5,TiVo 3 is awesome,"There are so many scheduling oddities, I used to have to check every day to make sure I was recording at the right time and for the correct amount of time, but TiVo does this automatically. And our ""little TiVo friend"" that records shows it thinks we'll like is a fun option. Everything is easy to understand and operate, and the quality is exceptional."
3,Decent but unneccesary,Pros:Controls on front of DVRClock on DVRDecent amount of spaceAmazon and YouTube appsSupports HDMICons:More expensive than the newer models that have much moreObsoleteHD content storage capacity sucksGlitchy at timesI don't reccomend this one unless you are a collector.
2,TiVo's interface now littered with ads. Yuck!,"TiVo Central, 4 of 8 menu items for ads (""Showcases"" and 3 ads). Delete a show: see another ad. Look at each folder of recordings: see more ads. Fast forward through ads: see AND HEAR a popup ad. This long-term customer is giving up and looking for another DVR. Stay away. TiVo's getting worse and worse, quickly."
1,dont trust them with your credit card,"I have paid literally thousands to tivo, and now I have just been victimized by their billing department. 14 months ago I replaced my old tivo and purchased a lifetime contract on a new Series 3. They claim that by default I agreed to terms listed at the time on their web site, although they can not provide a copy of the terms, because,""they were part of a limited time promotion"". They allege that I agreed to continue monthly service on my old unit after the end of one year of free service on my old unit. I made the transaction by phone, and DID NOT agree to maintain service on my old unit. I only have one TV! TiVo business practices are SLEAZY! Don't get tangled up with them."
2,DRM Tivo To Go,Series 3 replaces Tivo To Go with DRM. Forget about watching your recordings on the iPod and cross you fingers that the NFL won't flip on the no record flag.
3,Decided not to buy after talking to Tivo CS,I had a question - so I called Tivo Customer service. It was just like talking to my cable company. I hung up the phone and decided not to buy as I did not want another unresponsive company in my life. I have no doubt that this is a great product - poorly trained CS reps that can not wait to get you off the phone before they attempt to answer your ?
1,"They ""forget"" to mention something","Without a cablecard from your cable TV provider, this box cannot get digital channels. This makes it a hunk of scrap without the additional hassle of dealing with Comcast et al. (Ugh.)"
2,not worth switching from DirecTV to cable,"I have a Series2 tivo and love it. I'm not going to pay $599 + $200 for service, cancel my Directv and signup for cable to be able to use the Series3."
4,Good value,"So what is Daniel Johnston? Mental patient? Pop phenom? ... Hopeless romantic? Chain smoker? Yes, he is all these things and more. But the Daniel Johnston I am here to talk about is Daniel Johnston the recording artist. He writes eccentric songs that he sings in a childlike voice. His music is very hard to describe, you really need to hear it to get what he is all about. Many of the songs on this album are about romantic yearning, one of his favorite subjects. They are really quite lovely if you give them a chance. Although this album has a more ""professional"" sound than his earlier albums, it still has a homemade feel to it. There are many instances of ""mistakes"" that were left in, and sometimes Daniel's voice cracks. These imperfections add to the charm of the album. Fans of ""outsider"" music should dig this album."
2,If you enjoy music by insane people...,You will like this CD. Johnston is a no talent elephant man like oddity that people seem to like because he is mentally ill.The man can barely play the guitar and his voice grates like fingernails on a chalkboard.
3,Okay,"I was excited to make this bread in my machine, but was not impressed with it. It was simple to make, but I was disappointed in the taste. I will mix my own or use one of the other prepackaged bread mixes from Bob's Red Mill."
2,Worst. Mousepad. Ever.,"Ick. I wish I had read the product description more carefully (I guess I was blinded by the stunning Jayhawk, and didn't read).This is not really a nice, big, cushy mousepad. This is a little thin piece of plastic that somehow is supposed to be some miracle substance that is ""better"" than the old thick mousepads you know and love. Despite claims on the package that it's been scientifically proven to be a better mousepad, and do all sorts of wonderful stuff, it really seems to me just like a little thin, hard piece of plastic that just as easily could be sold for 79 cents.One star as a mouse pad; one extra star for the Jayhawk. Rock Chalk!"
5,This book is wonderful,"I found Barbara Stanny through David Bach's (*The Automatic Millionaire*) recommended reading list, and I'm pretty sure her books are changing my life. Ignore the whiners who complain ""There's not enough investment advice in this book!"" because that's not what *Prince Charming Isn't Coming* is about--and it's not at all what it *claims* to be about. It's about realizing that YOU, and only YOU, are in charge of your financial life, and that controlling your money and owning your future is actually much easier, more gratifying and less trouble than NOT enriching your life and understanding your money. Barbara Stanny is like an Abraham Lincoln for women--she sets us free. Her communication style is impeccable, and I want to give a copy of her--okay, her books--to everyone I know. HIGHLY recommended."
4,Take financial responsibility,"Women need to take financial responsibility. Married, single or divorced, women need to be in control of their money. Waiting for Prince Charming to rescue you from financial ruin is another way of saying, ""I'm helpless."""
1,Not for experienced investors,The book is for beginners. It doesn't offer anything new or useful to experienced investors--women or men. Waste of time.
3,If it's so motivational . . .,Why aren't this author's books available in an audio format? I'm too busy working my behind off to be a voracious book reader. I appreciate using my commute time (no matter the destination) to feed my brain. A big part of motivation is in the voice.
1,"Yes, it really is that bad.","Not sure what else I can add to the on the money write ups for this CD already available here, other than the fact that the Beanweevils are one of the most immature groups I've heard in a long time. I consider myself to be pretty open minded about most humorous things, but this stuff just isn't even mildly funny. And they compare themselves to Frank Zappa? That's probably the funniest thing about this band. Other than that, their singing reminds me of really bad Manhattan Transfer (is there good M.T.?) and the music capable but nothing to write home about. I wish I could have given it no stars."
4,I Just Had To Know,"I just had to know what this band sounded like due to the many colorful descriptions in the review section. In my humble opinion, the harmonies are very enjoyable and the lyrics seem to have embedded themselves deep into my brain( I find myself singing these songs all the time even if I don't want to). I don't know about the rest of you but I think ""Take A Bus"" is an amazing song. Catchy as all get out. I am pleasantly pleased with my purchase."
1,Worse than a migraine.,"A friend of mine purchased this one for me, knowing I liked humorous pop. I have to say that I wished she hadn't as nothing on here is very ""funny"". It's more than a little mean, often clueless, and forgettably dirty. ""Plak!"" is crude beyond comprehension and the rest of the album continues on a lewd streak that proves the band has nothing interesting to play or sing. Everyone should just give this one a wide berth. Hopefully the Beanweevils will go back into obscurity after this one."
1,This is funny?,I never thought I'd hear anything more pointless than a Jeff Foxworthy routine. Now I have.
1,Why does stuff like this get recorded in the first place?,"The Beanweevils. A few old dudes get together and attempt to be funny. A sense of humor is definitely not required for this disc because the jokes are about as laughable as Rip Taylor's toupee. In reality, these guys' ""career"" in music should last about two weeks. Unfortunately, they probably have a fan base of 13 year old kids who can push them into a third or fourth week. By all means, stay far away from this one."
1,Simply rotten.,Arguably the worst album of the year. One listen to singer Kelly Amthor on here and you'll understand why she's depicted as the large-breasted cartoony character on the band's website; she certainly has no talent in the vocal department.
3,Decent Booster seat for the price but not too cozy for sleeping,"This car seat is very easy to install and is very comfortable for my son. The only thing I don't like about it stands so erect that is difficult for the child to sleep in it very comfortably. Also, there is no padding on the each side of the head rest to keep the child's head from flopping about."
3,I'd buy another,"I read this in consumer reports to be the safest booster so I bought it. That is also why I would buy anotherbut, my son's head is pushed forward uncomfortably by the pillow head rest- I had to remove it until he is taller. I also can't get the cup holder to stay on. Other than that -I like this seat and feel like it is safe for my toddler."
3,Not easy to take apart,"I thought this was the perfect car seat because it goes up to 100lbs. My daughter was about 10 months when I purchased it because she was to long for the infant car seat. I will say, that it is very durable because she is now 17 months and it needs to be cleaned, however, I can't take it apart. The instructions are of no help. It's very nice but if you can't clean it what's the use?"
3,Good Car Seat Not that Great of a Booster Seat,"I have two of these seats in different colors and so does my neighbor. One of the first things I need to mention is that overall it is a good seat. However, as a booster seat it is not very good. It is hard to buckle the regular belt through it as a booster. Also, the belt positives are removable and my daughter had no problem getting them off when she turned 3. One of the seats is missing the postitioners since we could not find where she put it. The fact that these postitioners are just attached to the fabric does not seem to be very safe to me. Also, the cup holders are not very strong. One of mine and my neighbors broke (on the part that connects to the seat). Lastly, the while you can remove the harness systems to use it as a booster seat the bottom buckle is not removable and is a pain for my daughter. Overall, I would say buy it as a car seat as a transition between a infant seat and a booster."
1,Flimsy construction,"We bought this same seat in a different pattern 3 months ago. The guides for the harness keep coming out because they only pop into the seat thru the fabric. I can't count how many times I have looked back to see my son playing with them. When we had to remove the cover to wash it, it was very difficult to put back together. To top it all off, yesterday, I pulled the strap in the front to tighten the belts, and the lever you push down to adjust the straps broke free from the frame. Hardly what I would expect after only 3 months of use. It is a nice looking seat, but overall unimpressed with the poor construction. We're going to take it back and pay the extra money for the Britax. We have one of those that has made it through 2 kids and is still like new. Worth the $$$. Don't buy the Eddie Bauer."
1,Doesn't look comfortable,"I purchased this seat for our second car after buying the Eddie Bauer High Back Booster in Glacier from a Babies R Us store. I liked that one, and I figured this one would be similar. I thought the price was less because maybe it was an older pattern. However, when I got this seat, I was surprised to find that the quality seemed to be much lower than my other seat. It was very hard without much padding. The cover didn't seem very secure and the seat belt guides seemed flimsy. I am returning this seat, and I guess I will just get another one in Glacier like my first one."
5,Great stereo!,"Good price, along with the Pioneer CD-i200 iPod Adapter Cable DEH-P4900iB and DEH-P5900iB Car Stereo and good speakers make a killer system."
4,"If you have long hair, wear it up! Great Necklace though.","I needed silver jewelry for my cousin's wedding. I was a bridesmaid and the bride wanted us all to have silver jewelry. The necklace arrived right on time! Loved it and I still wear it from time to time. My only suggestion? If you have long hair, wear it up, otherwise you hair can get caught in the chain from time to time. Good buy for me though. I was satisfied."
5,"Beautiful, Inspiring, Utterly Unique","One of the best fruits of the post electric Miles band. The level of group interaction and improvisation combined with unique electric/acoustic textures makes this a must-have for any serious jazz collection. This album opened areas of exploration that have remained practically unexploited to this day. Standout among the entire brilliant collection of compositions is Joe Zawinul's ""Orange Lady"" a soulful journey through sounds and emotions that are deeply familiar and strange at the same time. Music at its highest level!"
3,Extension of Miles Davis,A great extension of the Miles free form with hints at the In A Silent Way sessions.
2,Headed in the Wrong Direction,"While this album boasts some of Miles' alumni such as Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, Miroslav Vitous and Airto Moreira it can't hold a candle to In A Silent Way, Bitches Brew or even Live-Evil. The pieces seem more like aimless sketches that are pleasent to listen to but ultimately go nowhere. It is a shame because of all of Shorter's albums with Miles and his solo albums before he joined Weather Report are hands down classics, after this he was just never the same. This was only the beginning of the end. After this, Weather Report descended into a bland jazz funk. For a more satisfying listen try any of Miles' 70's stuff or Wayne Shorter's Super Nova with a similar line up but far more adventurous sound."
3,It just goes on and on and on...,"I was incredibly disappointed in Newcomb's second novel. While the sections where there's actually action and adventure going on are just wonderfully enthralling, there's very large parts where it's just Wigg and Faegan explaining thing over and over. Those parts were very boring and actually put me to sleep at one point.It's a good read, but you could skip most of the hub-bub of the dialogue and still know what's going on with the storyline.And how many times is Tristan going to see the most beautiful woman he's ever seen? I think Celeste was woman number 4 described that way when she first appeared."
1,This is the first Newcomb book I have read...,...and it's also the last. Was Newcomb paid by the word on this novel? The rhetoric of his main wizard characters is distracting and downright annoying. Newcomb insults his readers by having his characters explain in great detail obvious plot points. The characters are stereotypical and flat. The story is predictable and slow. This book was a huge disappointment.
1,Not Worth it,"First I want to note that most of the reviews are either glowing, five star reviews, or they are very negative. It seems like Newcomb and his friends are at it again, writing false reviews. I mean give me a break! One so-called reviewer says, Goodkind's books don't hold a torch to these."" And another is counting the days until the next book! The worst thing is that I can even spot the repetitive grammar and poor English in these reviews that is a hallmark of Newcomb's writing! I read this book just to see if he'd improve. I was especially interested because I was personally acquainted with his bragging. I'd feel sorry for him if it weren't for this. Back to the book, the characters were flat and the story boring. The female characters are ridiculous."
1,Del Rey should be ashamed,"Ok, even a publisher who has sunk a lot of money into a longshot author needs to know when to quit. With the tide of crappy books on the market these days, Robert Newcomb has made his mark as the worst of the worst. Yet here is his second book, carefully packaged despite the howls of protest from fantasy fans such as myself who believed the hype about the first one, then read it and wondered if we had purchased the same book.More of the same brutal and inconsisent nonsense fills this book, with dull characters and a stupid plot. Spare yourself! Skip this book. And ignore every piece of marketing from Del Rey from now on."
2,High Hopes Dashed,"I really liked the first book in this series, it gave me high hopes that I had finally found another author to put in my rotation of must-buy books. This second outing is much much less notable - the hero could have never gotten involved and things would hardly change at all. I don't intend to ruin the story for anyone so I won't talk about it, but this author will have to work awfully damned hard to make this series worth reading after this. The writing is not bad, but the storyline and resolution needs help."
1,biggest load of trash,I pushed through the TFS but halfway through this one I absolutely forfeit. This book is not worth the time put into it. These books are a bunch of fancy covers with garbage inside. I am not going into details but to say anyone who did not heed prior warnings stay away. really.
3,Decent story against the backdrop of professional wrestling.,"That I read this book is a testament to sometimes being cheap - this was a free book on Kindle and for some reason I was bound and determined to read it. I say that because I have always hated professional wrestling.That being said, this was a decent book. The characters are mostly cartoons, but then so is professional wrestling. I was about 25% of the way through the book and realized I had no clue what the story was going to be. It started to become more apparent about half way through and by the end it turned into a decent read.It would have been helpful if the author better explained what the various terms meant. A wrestling fan probably knew them but I had no clue and had to figure them out by context."
4,My take,I don't read all that much there's only a few things that interest me but I have to say this book keeps me interested. I've read a lot of wrestling book and this is one of the good ones. I haven't finished it yet so I will give it a half review. One fall so far seems to deal with a lot of back stage politics which is no different then any job. It's a must read.
5,Captivating,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.Didn't think I would as I do not watch wrestling for all the reasons in this book. The story was captivating. It flowed and had me engrossed. There was industry talk because of the background of the story - I even learned some terms. There was also human interest, good versus evil, love story - enough to make this reader keep clicking the pages. There were sections of the story so rushingly vivid, the energy of the scene was in my head and I needed to know what would happen next. This story was not ""canned"".I absolutely loved the end ;). Had to review - I enjoyed, enjoyed, enjoyed this book.Thank you Spencer Baum."
5,The STAR is this book!,"I had been looking for interesting books for my 8 yr old son. This book was referred to me by his Teacher and boy did she nail it! It is very challenging to get my son to read different genre books because he is only interested in 'Animal' books. I've tried to introduce many different books that did not hold his attention. If the book didn't have an animal in the title or a picture of an animal on the cover, he was generally not interested. Well, this book changed all of that! His instruction is 20 minutes of reading every night - well, he read this book in its entirety the first night! He didn't want to put it down because he was really enjoying the characters and the storyline. Since then, he's more apt to reading 'other' books and seems to enjoy them also. All I can say is...thank you Mrs. Pina and thank you Candice F. Ransom!!"
5,Barry Manilow TV Specials,I am a huge Barry Manilow fan and remember watching these specials in the 70's and 80's so I was very excited to find them on DVD's. They are just as good now as then and if you are a Barry Manilow fan I think you will enjoy them.
3,Thrimmer switch poorly located,"It's a decent shaver, except for the trimmer's switch. Holding the shaver in the right hand, the thumb automatically falls on the trimmer's push-up switch. Of course, during shaving the manipulation of the shaver the thumb will move, and push the trimmer up inadvertently. Naturally, it's annoying."
2,"A mystery or a polemic, but not both","I have read Mr. Patison's first two Tibetan mysteries and found them compelling and heartbreaking in terms of their portrayal of Tibetan culture under the Chinese occupation. Sadly, I could not finish Bone Mountain (over 200 pages in) because in this particular case, the political position Mr. Patison advances (one I am in agreement with, by the way) just swamps any attempt at creating a mystery novel. I would willingly read a non-fiction book by Mr. Patison regarding the Chinese occupation of Tibet and I would like to go on reading his mystery series, but in this case it was literally too painful to go on. More mystery, less politics in the next ones, please."
1,Horrible,This item was not tasty at all..It had a over powering amount of clove. I was highly disappointed and would not recommend anyone to purchase this product.
2,Not as good as I had in Dublin,"Arrived with no ice. Too much cloves(?). Mushy, bland taste except for cloves. Expected more.Will try another brand next time."
2,Blood Sausage,I ordered the wrong kind. I wanted the French kind. Next time I'll know what to order as I am use to the French kind.
4,Room Temperature!!?,This frozen item arrived at least a week later than expected and at room temperature.For a meat product (sausage) not good.Just how long was it at room temperature???????????????Only saving grace...at least the dog didn't get sick
3,Good Local Drama,"I would imagine you could only enjoy this book if you lived in or near New England. Its fun reading. I would have to agree with others who know this town that it is NOT your typical New England town. Its a college town with cool restaurants, an extreme liberal bent and a strong homosexual identity. Worcester, MA is a far more interesting place. I love Tracy Kidder's books."
3,Mixed bag,"Tracy Kidder did an excellent job of capturing the many facets of Northampton. Unfortunately, the story didn't capture my attention like I had hoped.Perhaps I'm too biased from having visited Northampton so many times in my life. I kept thinking, ""Yeah? So what's the big deal?"" Perhaps I know too many people like the main characters? Perhaps I've lived in too many other towns like Northampton. Granted, I've never found a town QUITE like Northampton but I've found similar places with their own complex webs of history, shame and quirks.I have a feeling the ""flatness"" of the story probably had something to do with the fact that Kidder was reporting reality. I couldn't help but wonder if Kidder was manipulating any of the characters in his book to get a better story. (I doubt it but the thought did cross my mind)Kidder took on a difficult task and I suppose he did about as well as he could.It's an interesting, voyeuristic read and it really does reflect the reality of Northampton."
4,I really enjoyed this book.,I struggled through the first 40 pages and had thoughts of putting it down. But then it started to click for me and I found it to be a great read. A book for everyone. I would like to see what some of the people look like!
5,Kidder brings Hometown to life,"This is another of Tracy Kidder's wonderfully detailed stories. This time he brings the reader into a small town in western Massachusetts. Although history is interwoven throughout the book, it could not be more alive. He weaves the story through the lives of five or six characters. It is uncanny how interesting these people are. Had he written fiction, it would have been hard to believe that so much drama could happen in one small town, but knowing it's non-fiction makes it even better. I listened to this book on tape, and couldn't wait to get into the car to hear the next installment!"
3,my review,"This book is a pot pourri of stories about people who live in a little town in western Massachusetts, called Northampton.However well the author writes this book, it is very hard to get involved if there is no real story that holds the book together. I found it very hard to be able to follow everybody's comings and goings if there is no real central story and no central character. Of course the policeman, Tommy O'Connor if interesting, but there is absolutely no relation to Laura (the single mother) or to Alan, or even to his friend Rick because Tommy ""does not want to be involved"".The writing is very good, and the descriptions of characters and places are also very good, but without a real plot to the book, it just feels as if you are reading a newspaper story."
2,Doesn't live up to its promise,"This one was a disappointment. Unlike HOUSE, where Kidder was able to keep a strong narrative drive, here we are introduced to characters, brought into their lives and then left hanging. Julia, Alan, the Mayor, the stripper Alan had the affair with, they just don't serve the narrative drive of the book. The portrait of Tommy was unsatisfying as a result - every time he was absent, the story bogged down. There was so much more to know about him - for instance, for someone so attached to family and hometown, why was there no mention of his interactions with his siblings, other than one phone call from a brother. If he's estranged, I want to know, if they're tight, that's important too.What's more, I felt this tone throughout of an intellectual observer dropping in to a place and discovering that there is nobility and understanding in ""real people"". Rather than celebrating these people, the treatment felt condescending."
2,COULD ONLY BE A HOMETOWN FAVORITE,"There is no question about it -- if you live in or around Northampton, Massachusetts, you will probably enjoy this book more than others. To the outsider, this is a trip through Anytown, USA with some ""real"" characters who are all so borderline that you can't actually relate to any of them. Tommy O'Connor is the winner of the American dream award proving that if you dream it you can achieve it. It's hard not to be rooting for him all the way through."
2,a real disappointment...,"There's no question that Northampton is a fastinating place. But this book fails to capture it or to sustain the reader's interest, probably because the author chooses an uninteresting central character. Some of the secondary characters provide a spark of interest, but ultimately the book disappoints in a major way."
1,Glossed Over,"A bit of an over-dramtic piece of work about an elitist, hyper-liberal, zero-tolerance community, known to normal working class people in the surrounding towns as a place to, ""stay away from"". Northampton is FAR from the typical New England town. As a matter of fact it's pretty much different than just about any other town you might come across, save Greenwich Village or SF's Gay Quarter. Kidder definitely de-emphasizes Northampton's ""weirdness"". It's one of the few towns in America where homosexuals have actually assaulted heterosexuals based on gender preference (it's in the police records). ""Hometown"" was an interesting read, but it seemed Tracy Kidder was viewing this community through rose colored glasses. I kept wondering if he had taken a certain amount of artistic license to make the characters and story line seem more rich and folky. In conclusion, this is an interesting book...if you've never been to Northampton."
2,Tedious and Boring,"I had high expectations for this book. However, I found myself skipping pages and feeling very disappointed. Kidder did not engage me at all, his writing was prosaic in the worse sense, and the pace of the book was plodding. Read ""The Shipping News"", ""The Kite Runner"", ""Three Junes"", ""The Complete Short Stories of Flannery O'Connor"". While I realize that these books are fiction and Kidder's book is non-fiction, I still felt that I was reading a bad ""Dragnet"" script."
1,OCONNOR IS A DIRTY COP IN REAL LIFE,Maybe if people realized what OCONNOR is like in real life they would not believe the mumbo jumbo this book spews.
2,this book is not for a beginner,"i am new to the C++ STL. i try to understand how string, vector works by reading into this book. however, the book may be good for a STL designer, but definitely not for a beginner like me. the whole book lacks some practical examples to illustrate the concept."
4,"Excellent reference, a must for STL users","This is not a tutorial, thank you. It is a really good reference on all of the STL, even includes the non-standard but more useful hash_set and hash_map. Each container, iterator, function objects are described in detail, even has the name of the header file.The section I found most valuable is on function objects. Most people I know use only the containers. This book makes me start using function objects and iterator adaptors, it's a new dimension.I'm still waiting for a book that tells me how to EXTEND STL. For example, how to create my own thread-safe, exception-safe containers."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT","THIS IS A GOOD CD HOWEVER SOME OF THE GREATS ARE MISSING. WHERE IS I WANT YOUR SEX, MONKEY AND HARD DAY?? IT IS GOOD TO HAVE THE EXTENDED VERSION OF EVERYTHING SHE WANTS AS WELL AS LAST CHRISTMAS.STILL, RELEASE ALL THE HITS NOT JUST A FEW!! THE MAJORITY OF THESE SONGS I COULD DO WITHOUT!!"
5,Awsome!!!!!,"George Michael can only get better w/ age! I have been a fan since the very beginning & i will continue to buy all his music or any DVD'S he puts out. I dont care what ""religion"" he practices he is simply Awsome!"
5,George Michael - Twenty Five,If you love George Michael this is the CD for you. It has all of his wonderful songs and some duets. A great 2-CD set. A love-fest.
4,George Micheal's Twentyfive,"A good compilation of George Micheal's music,but two of my favorites were left off.""Cars & Trains"" and ""Cowboys & Angels"""
4,Very Talented Cat,"George Michael made some of the tightest cuts back in the day. the guy truly could write and Sing. his wham days had moments,but his Solo career is what made him a household name. and I still feel with the right type of record now he could easily come back.he has serious talent and for my Money Justin Timberlake could't hold one of George Michael's Choose Life Shirts. Carless Whisper, Jesus to a child, fastlove, one more try,praying for time,etc... George Michael was that dude back in the day who had style,charisma and brought alot of feeling in his music. i'd like to see him make one more serious run because he has the kind of talent that could easily hang today and even longer if he wanted to. this is a very good collection and a reminder of a true talent. in truth the Cat is very Underrated."
5,Unforgetable Music,"George Michael is one of my all time favorite musicians. I love the combination of the various stages of his career. I also gave one as a gift to my son, who loved it of course."
5,Happy CD,This cd just makes you happy. It is a great mixture of new and old material from an icon. Loved it. Definitely a mood lifter! You won't be disappointed.
5,GREAT ALBUM,George Michael one of the b est singers of his time brings back the classics and reinvents himself by collaborating with stars such as Paul Mcartny i recommend this album for any George Michael fan out there.
5,George Michael rediscovered,GREAT Discovery after his long absence in U.S. His tour audience was surprising...middle-aged couples enjoying wonderfully romantic night out
2,"Slightly Better than his ""Online Secrets"" which is abs. crap","I own two of Hellmuth's DVD's... This one and his Online Secrets... Online secrets was absolute crap and a waste of money summed up by someone telling you to hold 'phil's top 10 hands' while he sits back n counts the money he makes for sales of the DVD. Thank Phil ; ) ..Anyways this one was slightly better.. Some useful information between the lapses of filler time used to make the DVD longer.. I haven't seen either of these in awhile because I never bothered to watch them again.. Instead I found some more useful Sklansky DVD's, but prefer just reading and noting useful information...Recently I left my job to play poker full time.. I'd recommend Sklansky books... Hellmuth's book is pretty good also.. much better than his DVD's at least.."
1,Warning: Incorrectly Packaged. You might get Online Secrets by mistake,"I have purchased this DVD three times: twice from amazon and once from best buy. All three have been incorrectly packaged. It is the Online Secrets DVD incorrectly packaged as the Tournament Strategies DVD. This is a product flaw that you can not be aware of without opening the packaging and playing the DVD. Amazon has been good enough to accept both of my returns, even though they state that they don't accept opened DVDs. It's like buying Bambi and you put it in the player and discover its Debbie Does Dallas."
1,Just 2 hours of stories of how good Phil Helmuth is,"Heres the video in a nutshellRaise handsBluff handsGo all inDrink TeaPlay aggressiveTotal beginner stuff, what a joke."
2,"Bought it for cosmetic use and failed, but probably better for medical use","I thought I could use this for an Asian style lotion mask as it was recommended in Chizu Saeki's book. This does not work for this purpose. You can probably get 2 layers from these pads and although the length is good, it falls apart like a cotton ball and there's no way you'd get 5 layers as the book recommends. As whole pads, they're soft and plush, but if you're thinking of using these for the lotion mask, I'd advise against it. It's also way more expensive than the Daisan ones I just found now :("
5,AWESOME,"Orderded is product for a 2002 Isuzu Rodeo, not really an internet buyer so i was skeptical of purchasing this product. Overall very satisfied and especially for 4 bucks.. cant beat that"
4,Excellent!,"This video features a solid storyline with plenty of action and twists and turns that should appeal to both girls and boys--a young girl who is the descendent of a powerful priestess is drawn into a magical realm where she becomes embroiled in a fight to save it--with animation of pretty good quality.One of the things that really appealed to me was the design of the World in the Clouds... it was a fascinating ""what if Leonardo DaVinchi's more offbeat creations actually worked""/magic steam-punk kind of place.I suspect that if I had more extensive knowledge of Japanese culture and history that some aspects of this video would seem even more fascinating to me, perhaps even prompting a Five Star rating."
5,The Most Important Work of Historiography Ever Written,"Historians' Fallacies is not just about errors in writing history and it is not just for historians. This book tells you how to think, how to spot errors in logical analysis on any subject and how to avoid these errors. It is also hugely entertaining. Because the focus is on history - and each flaw in logic is illustrated by an excerpt from a prominent historian, anyone interested in history should read this book. But because these flaws in thinking can be seen everyday in the White House, the schoolroom and the daily newspaper (and everywhere else), this book is of immense importance to anyone who wants to think for him or herself."
4,"In-depth, education with its own fallacies","David Fischer's book is a good resource for any reader, specifically those in the discipline of history. It identifies and explains possible pitfalls with any type of investigative reporting. The book is divided into 3 sections: Inquiry, Explanation and Argument which cover the main areas these fallacies can occur. Since everything is relative, others have found fallacies in Fischer's work(s), this one is no different. I was assigned this book for a graduate course on historiography. Historians' Fallacies is a good companion to Mark Gilderhus' History and Historians, Davidson and Lytle's After the Fact and Richard Evans' In Defense of History."
4,Attention all Thinkers:,"I was recently introduced to the author's ""Washington's Crossing."" Quite impressed and informed, I read his book on Paul Revere's ride. Now I'm eating him up. Since ""fallacies"" was written 35 years ago, and his Washington book just recently, Professor Fischer seems to have been able to practice what he preached.This book reminds me of Mortimor Adler's ""How to Read a Book"" (the original--not the van Doren amplification; or Alfred North Whitehead's ""Modes of Thought"" or Barbara Hernstein-Smith's ""Contingencies of Value."" These much read books of mine seem to be called upon, every so often, to reacquaint me with the ways of encountering an event or a process. Fischer probably could have shortened the book by combining a few of his fallacies, but his ways of seeing are myriad and his way of writing clear."
4,Useful but ranting,"Mr. Fischer provides a fascinating vision of the seamy underbelly of history. All historians should be on the lookout for these mistakes. However, research is a painful process conducted in a finite period of time. Mistakes are part of historiography. A world without literary history and without mistaken (but fascinating) assumptions is a world not worth writing about."
2,Ugh,"This is required book in some classes, probably because there is nothing else out there on the subject. But do not be taken in by that fact.it is mpossible to read; using a cumbersome and strenuous writing style. Takes 2 pages to make an idiotic simple point that is obvious to anyone with a brain. Example: don't use statistics unless you actually know what you are doing with them. It lost all hope for me when he broke his own rules when showing examples. Let he who is without sin...There may be something worthwhile in this book, but it is terribly pretentious, and reads like it was written in 1824. Badly in need of a decent editor to cut out the excess, and shrink it to a size comparible with the actual information in it. An extra star given as it is not cranked up in price like so many books used in classes.Seriously, I do not understand why so many people think this is an important book. It is common sesne bogged down with poor writing."
5,Must have for home medical library,"As a mother of 8 children, I have found this book to be an invaluable asset. This is the first book that I consult for information on symptoms and treatment options. With everything listed in alphabetical order, it's simple to find what you're looking for."
1,The Reason I Bought The Book,"I have lived with migraines most of my life. Recently, at a visit to my HMO's headache specialist, she gave me a one page handout of the Mohrdar diet. Although I am following it with some success I would like more information.At the bottom of the handout this book, Smart Medicine for Healthier Living, was referenced with the sentence ""for more information on the anti-inflammatory diet.""I have a lot of questions about what I should and should not eat, to lessen the severity and frequency of my headaches.So I bought this book. AND THE DIET IS NOT IN HERE! There are a couple of dietary suggestions. But there is no reference to the Mohrdar diet at all.So this book is useless to me."
2,Shoe pack?,"Hmmm. I wonder if someone needs some coffee. I happened along this listing. And in the list of 6 or 7 images, all but ONE of them showed a sandle - from many different angles... Lovely. However, I've never been able to put a tent/sleeping bag/etc. in a shoe."
3,Not a universal piece of equipment,"It doesn't play on any DVD player in the house except my laptop. We've tried it in a DVD player, a portable DVD player and the Wii. It's annoying having to pull my laptop everytime we want to work out. The work out itself though is real intense but I am seeing results."
5,Great at home workout,"This is one of the best at home workouts that I have done. And I have done MANY. I thought that switching from Bob and Jillian and Mixing it with Jackie would be enough to get me through but after only 2 years I have become bored with the same workouts day in and day out. Along with P90x and the 90 day supreme workouts, they havent been able to hold my interest for long. Well with these workouts I have found them to be just what I needed. I love the different levels. And the fact that I can push myself if I need to and hang back some if I need to. And the fact that they are each longer than 30 minutes makes it even better. The only thing that I would change about them is possibily putting a little more cardio in the strength training workouts. Other than that I have enjoyed popping them in and doing them as my maintainance program."
3,it wasnt the bes product and i didnt even need it any more.,the lady talked too much.i retured it and i still havent gottern my money. Is okay to buy not for me.
2,Not impressed.,"I had seen the reviews before I ordered and decided to try it anyway. Wish I wouldn't have. The instructor is kind of annoying. I personally wish the workouts were a little bit more upbeat. 50 minutes is a good length workout but they seemed to drag on for those 50 minutesx,"
3,....why am I the only one sweating....???,I just received this series yesterday and jumped right into it. I had read the comments and was torn about whether or not to purchase the product. The first dvd is Cardio. I did the entire dvd at the highest level and was drenched. I loved the workout. The instructor on the other hand made me literally want to kick the tv in....oh my goodness. She has dry humor and and her voice was like nails on a chalkboard by the time I was done. She NEVER shuts up! Even my son who was in another room said she annoyed him. I think I will definitely continue the series on mute. Let me restate....I liked the workout and felt I got a good workout. The instructor's talking was really the only thing I couldn't deal with so putting it on mute should solve that issue. I would have given it four stars without the instructor.
2,trainer is insulting and foolish in her comments,"the exercises are fine but the camera shots are not good at showing the 3 levels and they are unclear who is doing what level. The trainer 's comments are insulting and foolish and not motivating at all. She tries to be funny but she is not and doesn't motivate because of her useless chatter-implying that only she is sweating and that the others in the video must be ""cheating"" etc. The exercises are intense and good but there is only one tape shorter than 1 hour and that one is done on the day you do another one."
4,awesome program!,"So far this is a great product! The only weird thing is, in my exercise room I only have a playstation 2 to play my videos on, not all of the dvds will play on it. In my living room I have a cheapy dvd player and they play on that. But ones that play on my dvd player do not play on my playstion."
5,Fantastic!,"As a practical beginner, I needed to ease into a workout, but also feel like I was going somewhere. THIS was it! I bought it on a whim, and have never been happier. The results are fantastic so far :)"
5,LOVE THIS WORKOUT!,"After having my third child, I was ready to try to drop the weight I put on. I was somewhat hesitant to try a DVD program, but heard good things about the X-TrainFit, I had to try it and I am so glad I did. This is an absolute awesome workout - and fun! I am consider myself a beginner for exercise level, and this series really made me feel successful at my level but challenges me to try harder. I can't imagine getting to level four - that looks HARD! Although I am not finished with the 12 week program, I am already seeing results and can't wait to see what the following weeks bring. This is an awesome workout and a must get for everyone!"
1,Very disappointed with this workout!,"This workout is neither hard nor challenging at all. This is an absolute beginner workout. I have been working out with DVDs for years now and was hoping for something to mix up my routine but this DVD series was a complete waste of money. Plus the instructor is so annoying it is really hard to not put it on mute. She talks too much and explains the moves between the reps far too detailed plus she takes water break all the time. This workout is not hard, I don't know why she needs to drink water all the time. This makes the breaks between the reps far too long. Plus the the people in the DVD, including the instructor, do not seem to be in a great shape. If this is the result of this workout than I'd rather skip this one. If you workout on an intermediate or advanced level then do not get this workout."
2,Repetitive Insults,"I wanted to like this set and I kept an open mind after reading the other negative reviews. I found the obnoxious, repetitive comments so distracting that I wanted to mute the TV...and ultimately I don't think I'll use these DVD's because of it. I thought maybe she was having an off day and the other DVD's would be better...so I used them all. Every one that is lead by the primary instructor has very same negative comments and some are quite odd and inappropriate. I thought I could ignore it and focus on the good points of the DVD's, but sadly there are not enough positives to outway the negatives for me. I'll look elsewhere."
5,This really kicks your butt!,"I've been working out for years, at least 5-6 times a week. Done Jillian Michaels, zumba, Paul Katami etc. They are all good and I thought I am in pretty nice shape.I've lost about 30 kgs in 3 years but I haven't seen any change in past months. Until Stephanie came.I want my workouts to be tough, I want to sweat -and boy, these are tough and I truly sweat. I've done about two weeks of this 12 week program and -I don't know if it's possible- seeing some changes already. My arms look way nicer and -what on earth- abs! Yes, I will have six-pack in no time.Stephanie is crazy, demanding but in a good way. There are modifications but I do usually stage 4 (except push ups). Give it a go especially if you are already more or less in shape but still in need for some more kick!"
5,GREAT workout DVDs!!!,"I had bought this over a month ago and just pulled it out last night.....did my first workout (along with my 6 year old daughther) this morning....VERY tough workout, but very doable....I went back and forth between the level 1 and level 2, mostly using level 2 and made it through the entire workout....(it has been a while since I excercised)....I am looking forward to the next 12 weeks and would strongly recommend this workout DVD to anyone who can't get to the gym....IT WILL MAKE YOU SWEAT! I actually burned 367 calories on my first workout....I enjoye the fact that is was ""normal"" people in the video as well...Go and get you one of these if you want a good and FUN workout!! The instructor is so funny and will keep you motivated!!"
1,Misleading cover art,"I have nothing to do with this program, yet I've found my stock photo being used on the cover and website. Super hard and consistent work and dieting went into those abs! The DVD art doesn't depict what you will get with this program alone."
5,wow this is tuff,"i have done p90x and chalean extreme and supreme 90 day. this video was shot at a gym it seems and the quality of the video itself is okay. stephanie is not the best at motivating. however, if you are self motivating as i am, this is one of the most brutal workouts i have done. i say this after day 3. i cannot believe how hard these are! i was afraid of insanity but if i can make it through this, then that is next because i cannot imagine things being much tougher. 7 weeks in and i have watched insanity and guess what, much of it is the same. still tuff! still working hard. seeing results. and not $150. i recommend for any level."
5,Fantastic!,"I have tried many exercise videos/systems, and haven't been able to stick with any until this one. It does not pretend to offer major results in 15 minutes per day. Nope, you need to spend 45-60 minutes per day (I usually do 5 days/week.) This really helped changed my mindset and finally rearrange my thinking to set aside the necessary time in my life. The format is very motivating - it breaks the work into chunks, which makes it easier for me to cope! My favorite part is the timer at the bottom of the screen that always lets you know how much time is remaining in each exercise as well as in the whole workout. Love it!!"
5,Definitely worked up a sweat!,"So, I decided to purchase this item as I have absolutely no time to get to the gym now that I have a little one...I wasn't too sure whether I'd get the burn that I do in the gym, but whoa mama--I did and more. I enjoy the workouts, I like the variety (following the plan) and I am seeing results!"
1,Not what I expected,"I have done many of the beachbody videos - P90, P90X, turbojam, turbofire. I like to workout and have been doing it for 20 years. I just wanted a different workout that was more weight training and less cardio specifically designed for women. I couldnt get through the first video. I was so dissapointed in the music, the main trainer's personality (I like Tony Horton and Chalean a lot - they push you to do your best!) and the overall appearance of the video. It is probably good if you are looking at no frills, no extra basic workout and you have your own music. It just was not a cheaper version of a beachbody workout which is what I was looking for. Oh well, different people are looking for different things in a workout as the other reviews seemed like it really works for some!"
2,lots of talking little action,"It's nothing like the cover.The women in the video don't have the strength or the shape portrayed in the misleading cover of this DVD.Once you are in front of the screen ready to sweat and give it your best, what you get is a lot of talking and explaining and joking and very little actual exercising. I was looking for a real challenging, result-producing workout, this was neither. I'm going to try Insanity next, I want to be pushed to my limit and not waste one minute of my designated work out time. X-TrainFit is not what it promises to be, don't judge a DVD by it's cover...."
4,You get results fast,I seen a difference just within the first week. I like the mods for different levels of fitness but some of the videos can be too repetitive and a little too long (one is well over an hr). I go back to this from time to time but there are other work out videos that give you the same if not more burn for half the time.
3,Less than perfect but....,This product comes beautifully packaged and appears to be quite professional however the video is anything but professional. The video is about as good as an expensive home camcorder. It's quite surprising. With that said the workouts are really good and the trainer is humorously sarcastic and thus slightly entertaining.
2,Ok for something a little different.,"I am a P90X, Insanity, Body Beast and this is only something I would use for a break inbetween my other workout programs. This is more for someone who needs something to start off with. This interval cardio does kick some butt but the weight portion does nothing for me. I like a more challanging weight training workout. Good for a beginner."
2,Not recommended,"The workout videos are fine but you will want to mute your tv after the second time around. The trainer seems to have forgotten that the people who buy the video will most likely be doing it over and over. Which means that you will have to hear Stephanie tease the men about having their ""man cards"" over and over and you will have to hear the same stories and comments which really have nothing to do with the workout. I found myself rolling my eyes and getting annoyed with the chit chat. If you want a good workout with motivational chit chat only, I would recommend Jeanette Jenkins. You will get a better workout, better music and much less silly commentary."
3,XTrainFit at Home Workout - Women's Complete,"i purchase the complete workout which included 8 DVD; 3 will not play on my DVD player. For me the Circuit and cardio DVD are the most challenging. The others are more at a immediate level, not extreme; but are okay. I do like that for each workout the instructor shows a modified level of each exercise. It was good price, so a good investment."
5,Insanity,I am impressed with this item. It was delivered earlier than expected. I started using it yesterday and it's amazing. I am burning all the fat!
5,LOVE IT!,I absolutely love X-TrainFit at home!! It's very effective and I personally think its the best out there!! great price and great results couldnt ask for more!! Everyone should get this!! trust me!!Very Effective! Lost 10 pounds so far and still going!
2,Needs an option to play workouts without instructor comments,"I'm returning these. I can't get over how the instructor spoke to the other people performing different levels. It wasn't motivating to hear Stephanie tell Mary how easy her Level 1 cardio exercise was for her to do. The instructor frequently made remarks like 'No one else is sweating except me.' Even when she gave motivating comments to the viewer at home, they came across to me as a teeny bit condescending.The workouts seem fine and are mostly what I am looking for, but I don't want to support a trainer who makes fun of people trying to work out with her. I could keep them and turn the sound down, but I'd rather buy something else."
1,Beware - for really out of shape people,"I have been doing insanity and wanted a new weight oriented workout. This was way, way too easy. Also, I want to watch people workout who's bodies that inspire me. Certainly not the case here. I wish I could return these DVDs."
5,Red Sox Nation Celebrate!!,The best documation of a team coming fron a 19-8 drubbing to win it all!! Plus to see the Yankee Fans squirm in their beloved Yankee Stadium as they blow a 3-0 lead and become the biggest chokers in the History Of sport!! That would be worth it but you also have the World Series! A 4-0 sweep of the team with the best record in the majors!! A must for any long suffering Red Sox Fan!! WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!
5,Hold onto your memories,"That special team is gone, those players have mostly moved on, but ""we'll always have 2004"". Great way to relive the fun, the hope and the victories. For every diehard fan."
2,great idea/poor product,can't we at least get the same wide-screen format we watched the original games in? I'll wait to buy it then.
5,Own this!,"I know where I was when the Boston Red Sox finally lifted their curse. When this was made for DVD, I had to get it. You can't forget how the Red Sox were about to be eliminated from the playoffs and somehow managed to get themselves to beat their rivals.This is a must have for sport buffs."
5,Ever Red Sox fans must have,"I'm not from Boston, but I sure enjoyed watching them beat the Evil Empire. This is a great collection of game re-braodcasts from the 2004 playoffs and world series. I thinks it's a must have for every Red Sox fan. Though it doesn't have any games from the ALDS...it has all 7 from the ALCS and the four from the WS. It also has bonus DVD's and the highlight DVD. It also has a nice option where you can pick what inning you want to watch. The picture is a little fuzzy, but is still worth it."
2,Gets worse with each viewing.,"I enjoyed watching this box-set immensely when I first purchased it in 2005. It's been all downhill since. Every time I watch any of the discs the poor video quality grates on me more and more. Come on, MLB, you can do better! How about a Bluray edition with the division series with the Angels thrown in (and widescreen, too!)? This edition's crummy video and missing playoff games are the reason I didn't purchase the 2007 World Series set."
5,SWEET!,"I have been a Sox fan practically since birth. My dad got this and we all love it! There's only one thing I don't really get. WHY DID THEY PUT GAMES 1-3 OF THE ALCS ON THERE? THEY LOST THOSE GAMES, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD!"
3,The worst quality for the greatest series.,"I completely agree with the other reviewers about the dissapointment I felt when I saw how bad the picture quality was on these discs and then to twist the knife even further, no surround sound and no widescreen! Couldnt they have given us at least 1 out of 3? Instead its VHS quality on DVD. Its hard to spend over $100 on such a shabby product but as a die hard Red Sox fan you are compelled to turn the other cheek and shell out the money because unless you taped the games on a DVR or VCR then this is the only way your going to have some of the greatest momements in Red Sox history captured pitch for pitch. By the way, if you did have the foresight to tape these games then I wouldnt bother buying this set because your not getting anything extra for your $100 besides the ability to chapter search and a few bonus features. Go SOX."
2,What a shame!!!!!!!!!,"The best playoff series has the worst production ever. VHS Quality at best. No Widescreen, No HD, No Digital Sound, Horrible video quality. Since the Fox NY logo appears on one of the sceens one has to wonder if the production was done by NY fans. Very Poor. 2 stars for the fact that the series was the best."
3,Substance over Style,Well I guess I won't be deleting game 4 of the World Series from my HD TiVo anytime soon. The content is great on these discs but the quality is poor. I just don't see why they didn't use the Fox HD broadcasts to master these. No widescreen or digital sound? Seems like a poor use of available technology to me. Maybe they'll do a higher quality directors cut and soak me for another hundred bucks later!? Or maybe they'll improve the quality of the next set after the Sox repeat this year!
4,"Not As Sweet As Sugar, But Still Good","This book started off just where Sugar left off.I like how all the family ties all came together. How people in Sugar's own neighborhood talked about her like a dog, but ended up being family members. Including the fact that she was is love with her own brother at one point and time until she found out who he was and had to break his heart. She didn't want to let him know because she didn't want to mess up her father's family. Well ain't she sweet, cuz I would have been hollaring...2df."
5,Just as Sweet as Sugar!!!!,"Bernice does it again and answers all the unanswered questions that rose in Sugar.....read Sugar first before reading this one though or you won't get alot of this story....Bernice is one of the best contemporary writers out there today, black, white, red or yellow. Vivid and riveting, you won't put this down until you are finished!!!!"
3,Lappy Did It!!!!,"The Bitter Earth was all over the place in some parts. I didn't know if the author was narrating the past, present, or future at times. I didn't quite feel the father and daughter relationship between Joe and Sugar. Nor did Joe talk much about Sugar's mom. I expected more from Joe and Sugar relationship when he found out about her. Also, Gloria's character didn't add anything to the story, she was dead weight. Also, toward the ending, the story moved too fast. Overall, it was a decent read. I'd recommend reading ""Sugar"" first. This is not a stand alone book.Overall rating: 3.0"
3,This Bitter Earth,"I read this book for my book club and wasn't sure what to expect when I began reading it, but I was pleasantly surprised by how engaged I became in the characters. McFadden did a good job of looping the storyline, and history of each character together in a way that kept you reading with a burning desire to know what will happen next! As the author strung the life of the main character, Sugar Lacey, together for us, bits and pieces of her life and her relation to the other characters in the story is revealed in a back stroy fashion. Each side story help to unravel many of the unanswered questions in Sugar's life and past. Together all of these side stories come together to answer the one burning question we are faced with at the beginning of the book....who is lappy? and what did he do! I won't tell you the answer, you'll have to read the book to find out!"
5,A True Storyteller,This is the follow up story to the book Sugar. I have read multiple books by Bernice McFadden and she is a true storyteller. This is one author who you should not miss out on!
5,SHE DID IT AGAIN!!!,"Bernice McFadden has concluded the issues and problems of SUGAR in this book. I won't tell the story - but buy this book!! It's worth all the money! The family jealousies, decept, greed, love, faith and incests are all mixed up in this magnicent plot. I have never read a family book so powerful as this..WHEW!!! I strongly suggests this book for all book clubs. Hot conversations over this book! (make sure you read SUGAR, but after reading this book, you'll be running to read SUGAR anyway!)"
4,Not up to her usual brilliance,"I adored Sugar and The Warmest December, but had read Sugar when it was first published. I found that the author presupposed knowledge of reading Sugar beforehand. Because of the time that had passed,many entries became confusing to me as I couldn;t recollect all that had happened. That being said,it is a good read,but a quick perusal of Sugar would make it a more enjoyable experience."
4,"It was great, just a little hurried toward the end.","I enjoyed Sugar. I actually remember reading it and not being able to put it down, and I was more than anxious to find out what happened next. I did enjoy the book, I just didn't like the way that the story wrapped so quickly at the end. I wanted to feel a little more of Lappy's suffering seeing that he was such a horrendous character. I didn't really like JJ or Mercy's parts in the story. I get where the author was going, but I didn't see the redemption in it. I love Bernice McFadden's work though, the way she tells her stories are amazing, but this one story left a little more to be desired."
1,Ho Hum snapshots from a rich lady,"If you're looking for a book of 'snapshots' from someone whose main interest is letting you know that she's traveled around the world, this book's for you! Chile, Viet Man, Havanna are all the places to be seen but Lauder failed to capture anything interesting about the people or locales. These are the type of photos that your friend wants you to suffer through when they've returned from a 14 day whirlwind tour through Europe. It's amazing what someone with a 35 mm camera and a lot of money can produce. PASS!!"
4,They forgot to mention the album art!,"This is the first/only album of theirs that I have (yet) - so I don't know if this is their ""style"" - but the CD packaging is a beautiful trippy thing! It's unusal in that the booklet is bound into the CD case - like a book! Pomo-psychedelic art by various band members, and all lyrics - in Spanish. Colorful, dreamy. Buy this one!"
2,2 singles and the rest is filler,"I had the opportunity to hear Luz Azul and El Album as MP3's, and was blown away. When I bought the CD, I found that these two tracks were unrepresentative of the rest, which I found boring. Sorry!"
4,Otra Forma de Sentir....,"Si te cansaste de canciones que no hablan de nada. Si ya no te emocionan los simples sonidos mil veces escuchados. Si tu cerebro, por hastío, te empuja a probar nuevos caminos...Bueno, entonces probá con este disco; sin poses ni artificios es capaz de hacerte sentir, o mejor dicho; de despertar emociones que seguramente estaban adormecidas dentro tuyo. Canciones como ""El Album"" o ""Rompecabezas"", tan simples, tan bellas, son capaces de provocar tu alegría y también tu tristeza."
5,Smells good,Awesome and last for a very long time. The price was wonderful and the bottle is very nice looking. Highly recommended.
2,"Hmmm, is this really a men's fragrance?","I got this because it has received such positive reviews, but I fail to see why. It has a feminine ""sweet"" smell, but it doesn't even smell that good. It is certainly not something that I would like to smell like, and I haven't received a single compliment on it so I know that I'm not crazy. One of my friends even said ""What's that smell"" while making a weird face. That is not exactly the sort of compliment that I was hoping for with a cologne.I don't know how to describe the smell other that ""sweet"" but it is certainly not crisp or refreshing or anything like that but rather a dull sweet smell that simply doesn't seem to align with what a man should smell like.I would look elsewhere"
2,BEWARE OF MIMING!,"""No lip syncing""?! Yea,REAL MUSICIANS! Bought this dvd specifically for Hall & Oates and Olivia Newton John,THEY ARE MIMING! Oh,the shame! There are some brilliant live performances here.Good job i didn't buy the box set! Anyone else found mimers on any of the other discs? I shall be e mailing H&O about this betrayal!"
2,...,"The love scenes were steamy and good, but the plot was boring. I wanted to finish it so sooooon because I literally kept yawning."
3,Decent but disappointing if you've read the Bar Cynster,"I actually found this book a little hard to get through. It wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't a very interesting one either. The characters in the book were really hard to get to like... not really interesting. I started to read the series AFTER I read this book and I actually displiked it more because of the future infidelity. It doesn't make sense with the character she wrote Sebastian to be in Promise in a Kiss. I think that this story should not have been written as a Cynster series book. It would be like Julia Quinn writing the story of Violet Bridgerton in the Bridgerton Series.. we all know how sad it would end. I for one, would rather not know how happy a couple was in the past (even if it is only fiction) and then find out about a tragedy, etc. Silly I know.. but I like to believe in the ""happier ever after"" endings..."
3,Write By Numbers,I just did not like this book. I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting and the writing formulaic and uninspiring. This really wasn't worthy of Stephanie Laurens and author whom I have always enjoyed.It isn't that the novel was bad -- which is why I suppose it got such high marks from other people; it's just that it was way too much like her previous books in the series. She seems bored with this series and should probably find something new and fresh to write about.
1,Mistake,I usually love any type of book but found this one to be very difficult to follow and not at all interesting. Maybe other books by this author are better.
1,DON'T TRUST STEPHANIE LAURENS,"I read the first couple of chapters and then skimed through hoping to find out why he cheated,but got absolutley nothing. If as in this book she claims or is trying to claim that Seb and Hel where so in love why did he cheat???????????????????? For a writer to want you to believe something and then print something else, just makes you wonder IF SHE WILL COME BACK AND SAY THAT DEVIL HAS ANOTHER CHILD WITH ANOTHER WOMAN BECAUSE HE CHEATED EVEN THOUGH SHE PORTRAYS THAT HE LOVES HON, WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THEM DO THEY ALL CHEAT ON THEIR WIFES AND HUSBANDS, I MEAN REALLY YOU JUST CAN'T TRUST HER AS A WRITER CAN YOU. LAST BOOK I SHALL EVER READ FROM HER."
3,Great Book!,I have read all of Stephanie Laurens books and this one is by far the best yet. If I could I would give it a 10. She makes her characters come alive as your reading the book.I would definately recommend this to others.
2,Not Happy!!,"O mi God, I couldn't wait to finish the book. It is so boring from the start that I actually felt like throw away the new novel when I reached pg. 220 (It is prety patient of me).What I think of this book is Ballroom, ballroom and ballroom again. And it seems that we are just led to view the sex scenes which is hot... however, the whole story is just so cheap that I think I could just bought any new writer's piece to get the same story....hmmm.. not happy!!"
5,Promise to Be Enthralled,"This is the 8th novel of the Cynster series and should have been the first. Up until now The Devil (Sylvester) had been my favorite sexy, powerful, male until I met his father! Well, okay, it may still be a toss-up but Sebastian and Helena have a powerful chemistry and attraction! Ms. Laurens writes a breathtaking love story. One can feel and see, as though they are a 'fly on the wall' because she makes us see them so clearly! Sebastian raising his eyebrow; the eye contact between Helena and Sebastian, all of it! Just the type of love story to curl up in front of the fireplace and savor.If this is your FIRST Cynster novel, I guarantee you will be HOOKED to read the rest!"
3,Sebastian's adultrey in a later book ruined it for me...,"This book would have been romantic and spellbinding IF Ms. Laurens had not written Sebastian as an adulterer after marrying his beloved Helena in her later books. I just couldn't get pass this and it made this read all the more disappointing. There is absolutely NO WAY the Sebastian portrayed in this book would ever cheat on the love of his life. As the other reviewers stated, nothing was ever plausibly written as to why he did this and because of it, fathered a son by another woman. The Promise in a Kiss has alot going for it if you can get pass this flaw."
2,Betrayal,"Having read all of Laurens' admittedly ridiculous, yet addictive books, I was really eager to find out Helena and Sebastian's story. However, like many readers I found the knowledge of Sebastian's future infidelity not only out of character but also contradictory to what (i thought) Laurens was trying to get at: the characters' eternal love. Personally, I thought Laurens would have used the prequel to explain (ADEQUATELY) Sebastian's infidelity. I think it would have been more in character if his little affair with Scandal's mother had occurred before he'd met Helena.Anyhow, as for the book itself. I found it boring and lacklustre. Instead of completing the Cynster circle, it only contradicted the 'fairy-tale' endings of the other books."
2,Rather Disappointing....,"Considering how much I had enjoyed reading the original 5 Cynster Series, this much-looked-forward-to pre-quel was rather disappointing...."
2,It's a good book...if not for the hero's future infamy,"Written in Laurens's typical style (packed with incomplete sentences, overly significant glances and tiny gestures, and domineering men), ""Promise"" is best read as a stand-alone novel, without its association with earlier stories in the Cynster series; if you don't have prior knowledge of the unhappiness and infidelity to which Sebastian & Helena are doomed, you'll probably enjoy the standard happily-ever-after plot."
2,Bittersweet...,"Does Stephanie Laurens really have to write Sebastian and Helena's story? The other Cynster books already gave a preview to their marriage. It's quite a spoiler to know that Sebastian will die before his sons get married (That means he's going to leave Helena and he's not going to see his grandchilden. What decent grandparent wouldn't want to witness the birth of his first grandchild before he die?) then there's the infidelity thing (I mean, he could have fathered Richard against his free will but NO he still have his wits when he did it!). I could certainly rant and rave about this more and give it only 1 star. BUT the story's still good (if you don't know the Cynsters yet). So I gave it a 2 (I still could get over what I know will happen in the future. So I can't give it a 3)."
4,Not as good as expected...,"I have read and enjoyed all (well, all the ones that feature the male Cynsters) of the Bar Cynster series. So when this one came out, I snatched it up.But, like other readers, I found it hard to believe the love story knowing the infidelity that was to follow. And it was kind of depressing to see the romance develop between a couple you know will be prematurely separated.It had the same type of soul-mate premise that all the books taking place after this prequel have followed. Up until this book, that same story managed to be new and fresh for each couple but this time it just seemed stagnant.I was disappointed in this book but look forward to reading the next in this series!"
3,Unbelievable!,"As an absolute fan of Stephanie Laurens and the Cynster series I have always questioned this prequel. As an individual book it is great, but it has been a disappointment the Duke's infidelity resulting in Richard, an illegitimate son, who has his own story."
4,Cynster Starter,"As I had read the offspring of Sebastien and Helena I still really love this novel. The same premise is there but the little details are what stood out for me. Stephanie is a true Regency expert. Careful to stay with the style and ton customs of the time, there were no waltz for example. I feel she should be commended for that.As well as the fact I knew how it would end. I know they would be happily ever after but the conflict,the characters, all still drove me to read and read. Meeting characters like Lady O as a young woman and knowing Helena as a young French lady was amazing and now has me desiring to start the series all over. Gotta go Devil's story is calling."
1,I just couldn't get into it!!!,I have loved all of the Cynster novels but I just couldn't get into this one. Knowing that Sebastian is going to be unfaithful to Helena in the future made me unable to get into the book. I mean how can you credit happily ever after when the hero has a child with someone else? That ruined the book for me. I'm with one of the other reveiwers who said that Stephanie Laurens should have had Richard's mother drug Sebastian as Catroina did Richard. That would at least had made the cheating understandable AND made this book something worth reading! All those who love the Cynster novels would do well to give this one a miss.
3,One rotten apple,"It's really too bad that Stephanie Laurens did not write this book first if she was going to have the hero be unfaithful to the heroine later in life. Knowing that he was unfaithful and had an illegitimate son was a piece of foreknowledge that made me constantly look for the flaw in him in this book and view his ""love"" with skepticism. And frankly, I don't really understand why Laurens felt the introduction of his infidelity and illegitimate son was necessary to the series. I am just not buying the excuse that he felt sorry for some woman and THEREFORE had sex with her. Whaaat? Excuse me? I feel sorry for a lot of people, but that doesn't mean I get horizontal with them. And did he have sex with all of the women in this book that the author states that he has helped over the years, including Lady Obaldstone? No, there is no evidence of that. So, with reluctance I had to give this book 3 stars instead of the 4 it deserved."
3,something really bugs me about this book....,"In Devil's Bride, the first book in the seriesDevil reveals that Scandal is in fact an Illegitimatechild- the outcome of an affair Sebastian had with awoman in Scotland, 5 years into his marriage withHelena- I just couldn't let that nasty factout of my head... It made it *really* hard forme to like Sebastian. after all- we gals readromance books for the 'togeher happily ever after' part,right?other then that- no complaints- good book!"
4,POWERFUL!,"This fan does exactly what is says - CIRCULATES AIR. It is powerful! Therefore, my only complaint is the very reason I like it. It is LOUD but only because it SO powerful. This is a great fan to circulate air in a stagnant house, regardless of room size! I only use the slowest setting too, because that provides enough air flow for our entire living room. Recommended by this Amazonian."
2,Fans work but delivery condition was terrible,Fans work fine but all 3 fans that I ordered were dented due to ridiculous shipping method
1,Poor quality scanned document,Don't buy this. It's a very poor quality scanned copy of an original document. Very hard to read.
3,Let Me Steer You Straight,"If you love DUB, lemme steer you straight.Don't order this, but order Twilight Circus's""Dub From The Secret Vaults."" I would estimate,conservatively, that Dub From The Secret Vaultsis approximately 10,000 times better than ""Riddim Clash.""Sorry to say anything negative, but Secret Vaults isSO much beter, I felt I had to speak up. Thank you."
1,Piece of junk ... buyer beware,"Received this harness. Looks nice, but ... wired everything up, right front speaker didn't work. This Chinese made piece of crap did not have the wires crimped down inside the connector. Wires pulled right out. Now try to get the connector pin out so you can re-crimp it. Have to ruin the whole plug. Run ... run away. Be afraid ... very afraid."
4,Insightful and moving,"Insightful and moving, revealing an unexpected point of view. This will certainly provide you with a different perspective to consider. Well worth the read."
1,In Search of a Rising Tide,Probably the worse DVD I have ever viewed. I don't suggest anyone buy this selection!
2,Misleading but acceptable,"The Title of this CD would lead a listener to think they were in for some Tibetan Chant or something that inspires Tibetan Chant. This could not be further from the truth. There is no Tibetan Chant on this CD, folks. You will, however, find some interesting music from India. Especially scintilating is ""Ragam and Tanam"" by Dr. L. Subramaniam. He has taken the western violin and blended it splendidly into the rythyms of India. If you are looking for some Tibetan Chant though, look elsewhere."
5,Simply awesome!,"This record has all the ingredients to become a big success for this band. 13 Rock & Roll /Rockabilly cuts in the most genuine style with not just their own songs but also covers of Glen Barber, Charlie Feathers, Johnny Burnette and an amazing instrumental cover of the soundtrack of the film ""Golden Earrings"". What else can I say... Get it!"
5,Relic Watch,"Love the watch! It looks really sharp, you can adjust the links to fit your wrist, is very easy to read and isn't heavy. I'm very happy with it and it was exactly what I was looking for - classy, easy to care for, able to go from day to night and still be professional yet stylish."
5,Awesome reading!,"I have long been searching for an analysis of the end times that makes sense, and I definitely found it in this book! Highly readable, David Currie does a fantastic job of pulling together the information into a cohesive whole! I highly recommend this book for anyone searching for answers, as I was...A+++"
1,"The Rapture is Real, the Doctrines about it are False","I too was led to believe in an imminent rapture and that many would be left behind. But that's not true.... but neither is Currie's interpretation of prophetic scriptures. Yes, the rapture is real; it will occur, but just not when and how the popular writers tell us.No one will be ""Left Behind,"" because the Bible teaches us that all people will be raptured and then stand before God to be judged... the whole world at once.And it won't be imminent. Scripture clearly of an appointed time.Too many people who are afraid of the tribulation try to ""escape"" it by inventing a pre-trib rapture scenerio. No, it won't be pre-trib, but it will be pre-WRATH.However; for those who choose not to believe it, don't worry, you won't miss it, because the world will not experience the rapture until the very end. I feel more sorrow for those who expect it in their lifetime who will lose faith when it doesn't happen according to their errant doctrine..."
5,Rapture: Then End-Times Error that Leaves the Bible Behind,"I was more or less familiar with rapture theology before I read Rapture. It was a great book because it helped solidify what the rapture is and how the Bible supports and does not support the rapture theology. Currie makes a thorough analysis of Daniel, the Apocalypse, Matthew, and some of the Epistles, focusing on passages that are relevant to the topic of the rapture. Furthermore, Currie cites early Church fathers to support his Biblical textual analysis. It is a wonderful read, and despite the difficulty of the topic, Currie does a good job of helping the common person understand the rapture."
3,Yes and No,It is necessary to take a leap of faith to in order to fully accept Christian doctrine.There has always been within Christendom that group which does (take a leap of fatih) and that group (Apologists) that do not. This is NOT a Catholic v Protestant division.This book is written from the Apologist point of view. I give it a three star rating for the research but do accept its conclusions. However it does contain some valid criticisms.Evangelicals fall into error when their faith becomes presumption.Regarding end times eschatology - no time table should calculated (and the instruction not to do this appears in Scripture) - that is the error -the mistake that many Evangelicals make.It is not an error to believe by faith in the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.For decades Christian Apologists taught that the prophesized rebirth of Israel was intended as a spiritual metaphor nothing more.Well we all know what happened in 1948.
1,"What ""Bible"" Was This Work Written About!","Evidently this author used some ""other"" Bible than the one God wrote to give us the Currie ""discernment"" of the scriptures. Not surprising as Roman Catholicism seems satisfied to preach their own ""gospel""! The truth matters not to those whose chief concern is the money they can take in from this activity. For those of you who would like the ""Real Truth"" read the ""valid"" Word Of God. For those of you who would rather remain ""ignorant"" then this piece of dribble is just the ""thing"" for you. If you accept this book as the truth then I would like to invite all of you to enjoy the ""TRIBULATION""!"
2,Needs help....,"This is not a product you want to buy, It is hard to work with, the pen is way oversized, ect. Not to mention that Logitach io2 only allows one training session, thats all. and if something goes wrong with the training session, you're done for! Have you guessed? That is what happend to me. The mistake rendered the pen & software unusable."
1,Handwriting recognition is poor,"I purchased this item because I wanted to be able to have electronic copies of meeting notes created automatically. This system does make excellent electronic copies of notes (as images), but I found the hand writing recognition to be too imperfect. In order for the software to be able to convert your handwriting to text, you must write in very legible handwriting, which is simply not my personal style when taking notes during meetings."
1,Product not what was expected,Received a Logitech pen in plain packaging with what appeared to be a 'home-made' cd with no labeling and containing a file I could not read. This is probably a seller issue and not the fault of Logitech.
1,io2 Impressions,"Basically, nice concept - poor realization.Got the pen a week ago. Installed the latest software on Win XP SP2.First surprise - Collins Digital io Notepad displays wrongly in View Mode. The background page is shrunk in the upper left corner leaving the written text over blue background. After a couple of days of struggle - Logitech admitted the problem and kindly prompted me to ""Please continue to use the Cambridge Notebook for now"". He-he, this is the paper which comes in the package plus I already bought a few extra notepads as these were the cheapest. I thought that they would have tested it better.The pen is large, read uncomfortable after short use; expensive for what it is; transfering files is slow; text recognition is average; it still looks as compu gadget at meetings.I personally would have been happier with a slim fast scanner for scanning my meeting notes. Cheaper and most comfortable."
1,Problems syncing.,I bought this and it only synced up with my computer once. I consider myself very computer literate and worked with Logitech support to figure it out. They dubbed it defective so I exchanged the device. Same problem again. I use a laptop now instead.
1,Subscription problems,"Mitchell1 eAutoRepair Do-It-Yourself Automotive Repair Information (1-Year Activation Card)Bought the one-year subscription - the ID number on the card would not activate the account. Several emails to Tech support resulted in them sending me other ID numbers to try - none of them will activate the subscription either.It seems incomprehensable that the company cannot provide a subscription number that will active the account. Makes me wonder about the quality of the infomation provided.Anyway, still trying to get Tech Support to activete the account - and still out the $13.00."
2,Better school book than practice book,"This is an exhaustive book on repro. It is NOT a quick reference nor a book to get a quick answer. If you want a thorough review, this is it. I was hoping for a better quick reference approach."
2,hard to read,"This book is for doctors and veterinarians. It is hard to read as a student. It's contained with a ton of information, but I personally find it hard to read."
4,Very good,My son and I have Cleiac and love the pretzels. It is hard to keep them in the house because everyone likes them better than regular pretzels. They are crispier than most. Great product!!
5,Glutino pretzel sticks are great!,"I regularly buy the Glutino pretzel sticks for my family. We had been missing pretzel sticks after going on the gluten free diet and were so happy to find these. They taste really great, almost like their wheat counterparts. Each of the many bags we've eaten has always been fresh and crunchy - never stale. A bag of these pretzels doesn't last very long in our house."
5,A great snack choice!!,I just bought these for the first time. WOW! They are wonderful--not at all something that simulates pretzel taste. Many times the gluten free products I try are not even a good imitation of the real thing. This is not the case with these pretzels. I took them to my office and let everyone try them. I had a hard time keeping everyone away after one taste!One serious word of caution--They are so good you will find yourself eating more than you should!
2,Smashed.,Most of the pretzels when I got them where smashed into little pieces. The packaging seemed appropriate. Maybe that's why there was a deal on these.
5,Best Gluten-Free Pretzel - I love these!!!,I love these pretzels. They are just hard to find. I think pretzels have too much salt on them and I am always trying to scratch off the salt with my finger nails or a knife or something. Even if I wasn't trying to watch my salt intake I try to take the salt off because they just put too much salt on pretzels. These pretzels are really very good tasting. I was afraid because they are gluten free they wouldn't taste very good because a lot of the gluten free products you sacrifice taste. But not with these. These are very close to regular pretzels and I am so glad they come in salt free. I buy them by the case.
5,"Great snack, great price","These gluten free pretzels are absolutely the best I've tried. I have been eating this brand for a long time, and I think this is the best price I've seen for them (less than $5 a bag)."
2,Pretzels are broken,I love these pretzels but there has recently been a change in the process and pretzel size and half of each bag of pretzels is coming broken. This has happened more than once now.
5,"delicious, crunchy","these are awesome. though they're gluten free, they taste wayyyy better than regular pretzels. they're crunchier, no bad aftertaste or anything, and taste buttery. only thing is, you have to make sure you put leftovers in a sealed bag or else they get stale quickly, but overall awesome."
4,Great product but needs to be packed better,"As far as the product goes - these are excellent. Can't even tell they're gluten free. Nice and crispy and good flavor. Usually they're packed well but the boxed was partially crushed on this last shipment and half the pretzels were broken. They had slapped a shipping label right over the ""fragile"" that was printed on the box. Not good thinking."
2,Change of recipe - not a good change for taste,"My family used to buy these by the case because they tasted so fantastic. Unfortunately, Glutino has changed the receipe in the past few months and now they don't taste at all the same. My children refuse to touch them and they have an almost burnt taste at the bottom. Glutino told me that their recipe is healthier now than before and they don't intend to change it back. If you want pretzels to eat pretzels, they are still a good choice. If you are looking for the same great taste as before - don't waste your money here. They are not worth the price they used to be at all."
5,Tasty pretzels,"I really like these pretzels. They are one of the few brands of pretzels that I can eat. The company recently changed the ingredients and I liked it better before, but I got used to the new taste. Pretty good product and cheaper on Amazon than in stores."
5,Great Gluten Free Product,"I actually like this product better than regular pretzels, which is good because I'm a celiac. My sister, who lucky for her didn't get the celiac disease gene, will even steal some pretzels when I'm eating them. If only all gluten free products were this good!"
5,Thank goodness!,"I was so happy to discover these! When I had to go gluten-free I thought I'd never snack on anything but berries and carrots ever again. I prefer the low-sodium ones, and they honestly taste as good as the regular ones. All of my friends eat them too, because they're even better than normal gluten-filled pretzles. Thanks, Glutino!"
3,Good for Gluten Free Diets,"These pretzels are OK for the gluten free diet but not a good substitute for ""real"" pretzels."
1,Comes from so far away,"This product comes to us from the Middle East, which represents so much carbon impact for a food product that gluten-free folks (such as myself) may be purchasing frequently. There are other gluten-free products made in this country which have similar quality...which is how I'm going to spend my money."
5,I like them much more than regular pretzels,"My son's celiac so we buy these pretzels by the case. I was never a big fan of pretzels but I eat these all the time. They''ve got just the right amount of crunch and salt, and they're good for dipping in things like hummos. My kid loves them too. They're a bit expensive but definitely worth it."
1,May not be totally gluten free,"I ordered this for my mom, who has Celiac disease. She could not tolerate it, it gave her bad diarrhea, as if it had gluten in it."
5,Delicious Gluten-Free snack!,"A lot of gluten-free snacks do not taste very good, its sad but true. And on top of that a lot of gluten-free foods are very costly. These pretzels however are delicious. I cannot taste any difference between these and regular pretzels, in some ways I actually prefer the gluten-free ones. Truly a great snack for those of us with restricted diets."
4,Camp grill,Great grill for outdoor cooking. Easy to set up and use. Different height levels to adjust to the heat of your fire. Worth the money.
2,Needs improvement,The paint is not fire resistant and burns off. The spit has a split fork design which stops it from turning 360 degrees. The adjusable height for the grill and spit is nice. I modified the desing to adjust the with to fit my fire pit and to accomidate an electric rotissery.
2,Texasport Rotisserie & Spit Grill,It is very hard to switch positions. It is a different setup then the picture even shown on the box. If it was made like the picture on the box it would be alot easier to use and I would have liked it alot. But it was really hard to change positions and it fell how many times when I was trying to change the position.
4,A great old Western feel,This is a great grill if you want to feel the old Western backwoods feeling of little house in the prairie days. It keeps the meet high off the fire while keeping a tender and moist. Multi use makes this a fun camping accessory. While it is a little cumbersome to bring along you and your guests will enjoy the taste of your food as well as the feel of olden days camping.
3,So-So,Bought the Texsport Rotisserie & Spit Grill new. On second use it fell apart. The first time it was used it was awesome...would have liked to have used it more. It was as if the weld on the side of the leg was not even welded...
4,spit and rotisserie grill,Overall the grill is great for the price. Its a bit unsteady so I secured it with some rocks to make it more stable. Its also little small but I couldn't find any larger sizes.
4,"overall, a winner","This device worked as promised. While it may not be cast iron study it was plenty able to hold 2 -3 chickens and pots. This is better than a tripod and the rotisserie worked. However the 2 spits won't hold an empty cavity chicken. We added a lemon half that we placed the skewer through. Also we stuffed another with parboiled red potatoes and then sewed the cavity. In both cases the chickens were better controlled. My only advice to the designers- telescoping feet that can be reduced for iron campfire rings. Ours worked but we couldn't always maneuver for best position. If it came with a carrying bag, it would have gotten 5 stars."
2,"Seems awesome, but it's actually just disappointing...","So I ordered this for my boyfriend's birthday. I was super excited because he loves to grill and we are big campers so I thought this would be perfect. First of all it's not very sturdy at all. The hooks on either side couldn't really be used for their intended purpose (to hang things like a kettle with water like in the picture) it's way too WEAK AND WOBBLY. If you want to cook some hamburgers and hot dogs it would probably work. But the other bad thing is that it's very low to the ground. Even on the highest setting it's not very convenient. Also once it gets hot you can't adjust it without gloves or something because the whole thing will get hot. It is a good price, but you'd be better off spending more and getting something better. I sent it back."
2,Paint/Coating burnt off,"This item was easy to set up, but hard to re-adjust when in use, you have to unscrew the winged screws to lower the rotisserie which is not easy to do when its hot and a chicken is already on the spit (Two People Needed with gloves).The spit is one center pole and a secondary stabilizing pole, this didn't do a very good job holding the wobbly chicken steady. I would have rather had two of the 4 pronged holders.The grilling part had an issue with the coating burning off and flaking when heated by the fire, i had to scrape it real good before i put anything on it."
5,"Modern, sleek chandelier","I was looking for a chandelier that was simple and modern, to fit in with my contemporary decor. This fit the bill perfectly, was reasonably priced, and easy to install."
1,Subscription is for ONE vehicle Only,"I returned the activation card without activating because I was misled by the description of the product. I understood that the eAutoRepair activation would be for a multitude of ""vehicles from 1983 to Present"", but the card is for only ONE vehicle per subscription.........not mentioned in the description."
1,mitchell1 the worst.,"Waste of money,easy to get lost,cryptic linking,useless photos copied from service manuals. Electric schematics that leave you lost. If you have a electric short this on line service will never help you find the wires.So if you want to waste your money go ahead I did."
1,Stay away from them,"This company will let you buy a subscription for one vehicle at a time (no problem), except the fact that you cannot search for a technical service bulliten straight away. you cant search by tsb number or date. sure you can go to the categories tab. thats rich. there are about 100 categories. it will take you your full months subscription to find what you are looking for. truly elegant the way you can find all the tsbs you want grouped together (with no hot linking) when perusing the site but once you are a customer that feature is non existent."
1,Total and complete rubbish,"I went onto the site looking for instructions on how to replace the driver's side mirror on my '02 Ford Focus. The instructions constituted all of seven sentences, with not a single illustration or photograph to help you along. This website is an absolute scam. You can't know if the product is in any way useful until you've already paid. There are smooth-talking con artists in New Orleans' French Quarter who will at least provide you with some entertainment while they're talking you out of your money. Mitchell1 isn't even funny."
2,Very disappointed,"I had expected this to at least give me specific instructions for the one vehicle but this so called ""repair information"" doesn't even tell you where the gas filter is located or how to replace it.Most of the information is readily available by doing a search of google.I registered so cannot return it but I guess 12 dollars for 4 years won't break the bank.I gave it two stars because it was cheap....and in more ways than one."
1,Very Basic information buy a chilton or Haynes instead,"I purchased this product to get information on how to best remove a transmission from my S-10 truck. The manual did indeed have a section to do this but had no diagrams showing what should be removed. The instructions where, lift the truck and then remove transmission, like I didn't know that much. Specifics are sorely lacking in these manuals. Save your money and by a legitimate product."
1,Not Worth It,It's cheap and worth every penny--save your money! Graphics (poor quality) are not on the same page as the related text. Very poor interface. No helpful text on installation or removal. Don't think for a minute this will help you perform repairs. No help for even simple repairs like installing pads or rotors.
1,Do not subscribe - useless,"Mitchell1 your eAutorepair solution is not worth your money. The website is difficult to navigate and the information is not available. I subscribed intending to find something about the fuel system and no luch there. Could not find this through the online index or other weak links.I also tried the maintenance link and found something that allows you to select maintenance intervals > click on that link> and then you get a menu of maintenance items with corresponding checkboxes on the side. The check boxes are useless. Seriously - they do absolutely nothing. I thought it would allow me to see instructions for these items, but they are simply checkboxes with no function."
1,Thanks for the info,I would have purchased this ridiculous item if not for the comment above. Thanks for alerting me to the misleading information.
2,Spend a little more for a craftsman,"I went for the cheap option and bought this. Its works for very light duty tasks. I had to take out a medium size bush and it managed to do that, but you can see that the metal is bent and that it will fall apart with enough time. Wish I went to the store and got a better made shovel. Would have been worth the extra money."
2,Not great but I'll find a use for it.,"Not a great shovel, and to add insult to injury I found this significantly cheaper at a big box hardware store that rhymes with ""dome peephole"". This is overpriced just so they can ship it for free with prime. Garden tools will now be purchased at ""dome peephole"" because they almost always seem to be cheaper than their prime counterparts. Back to the shovel. Its not well attatched to the handle and the handle is already splintering. I've used it once to dig a hole, to be fair it was in caliche. I guess I will just use this to turn the compost pile and in my raised bed garden for now."
5,One of those books you gotta loan to your friends.,"A great book. One of the types you have to loan out to all your lesbian friends, and especially good to loan to that 'straight' girl who just needs a little erotic fiction to push her over the edge."
5,Buy the book because you'll feel good that she's investing,"Buy the book because you'll feel good that she's investing the profits.The power of this book is that it critiques the global financial system without demonizing the individuals involved. It's a lesson that the ""anti-globalists"" should take to heart. We can protest all we want outside of WTO meetings but things won't change until we get more caring and fair rabble rousers a la Garson inside of the global financial institutions. Get a start on that insider career by reading this book."
5,Outstading,"After having used generic mats in our Camry, we opted to go with these. I bought them a few weeks earlier for a 2006 Avalon and couldn't believe the excellent coverage we had on the carpeting (front and back). The Camry mats fit like a glove and have the holes (and clips provided) to secure them to the floor. Great purchase."
1,'Cliff Notes' on Earned Value,"This book is a mere set of `Cliff notes' on the topic of earned value. Other than providing a very high level view of the material it has little or no value to project managers and does not add anything to the understanding or practice of earned value. I am still looking for the simple and insightful tips that the author promises in his overview.For a deeper treatment of earned value I would recommend either ""Earned Value Project Management, Second Edition"" by Fleming and Koppelman, or better yet ""Using Earned Value: A Project Manager's Guide"" by Alan Webb."
4,A fun way to look at EVM,"EVM is all the rage, particularly for Federal contracts. This book offers a great fun way to look at this material. It almost makes it easy to understand and focuses on the application of the concept. Particularly good if you are having trouble with the mechanics of calculativ the various EVM inputs."
2,Slow and Plodding,"I finished it, but it took some time. I found the all the characters dull and their motivations unbelievable. And I know I had read Cleo's sister Maya's story a while ago, but for the life of me couldn't remember one bit of it, so that book obviously had the same impact on me as this one. Hard to finish and easily forgettable."
1,BOOK ERROR-HOOVER DIED IN 1972!,"There's a photo in the book of a FBI Graduation Class Photo which says it's John O'Neil's 1976 Graduation Class Photo, and it also says that in 1976, J. Edgar Hoover was the director of the FBI, and in the photograph you can see Hoover standing in the front row. HOOVER DIED in 1972, he can't be director of anything, let alone the FBI in 1976. The guy identified in the photograph as John O'Neil is hard to see, he's in the back row, and is really just a blur. So my guess is, that this isn't John O'Neil FBI Class Photo. You'd think the editors of the book or Mr. Weiss would know when J. Edgar Hoover had died. I'm only 25, and I knew that photo was wrong, the moment I read the caption.I didn't buy this book, because I couldn't trust it."
1,Incorrect Cause and Effect for Terrorism,"In Chapter 5, Weiss claims that ""Reagan ordered multiple air strikes on the Libyan capital of Tripoli in retaliation for Pan Am 103 and the West Berlin disco bombing, which killed two U.S (period missing in original) servicemen. Several of Libyan strongman Muammar Qaddafi's family members were hurt in the attacks, and a chastened Qaddafi moved away from sponsoring terrorism.""Weiss is incorrect. While the US did bomb Libya shortly after the German disco was bombed in 1996, the U.S. did not bomb Libya again after the Pan Am flight. Libya probably bombed Pan Am 103 in retaliation for the bombings on Libya in 1996.Considering that the topic of this book is terrorism, Weiss is either incompetent or deliberately misleading. Understanding cause and effect is critical when dealing with enemies."
2,Interesting but mildly partisan,"The unfortunate slant to information presented leaves me wondering about the verisimilitude of all facts contained in this book. The author rightfully bashes Clinton for his lapses in the undeclared war on terrorism. However, he doesn't discuss how Clinton had less public support to undergo the full-blown war that Bush enjoyed after the attacks. He also doesn't mention that Bush sent millions in tax-payer dollars to bin Laden only months prior to the attacks and that he did nothing more than Clinton did - even made the FBI back off further. What little mention he makes of Bush is in a partisan, favorable fashion. Such bios is already plentiful enough in media today. You would be better off reading the book O'Neil helped on: ""Forbidden Truth: U.S.-Taliban Secret Oil Diplomacy, Saudi Arabia and the Failed Search for bin Laden."""
1,Hero Worship,"This is an unbalanced, hagiographic account of a man even whose best friends admit he was a pain to work for. Author Weiss cannot find a single critical thing to say about O'Neill, and wastes ink talking about his exploits at Elaine's. The war against terrorism will likely not be solved by cops with inflated egos who have a taste for expensive suits.Weiss is out of his depths when it comes to international affairs, and it shows. The book is full of bloopers like the following (which takes place in Aden, Yemen -- page 315) ""As O'Neill stood in the hot Mediterranean sun examining the crime scene..."" Aden is about as close to the Mediterranean as Los Angeles is to the Great Lakes.If you're interested, this is one item to check out of the public library rather than shell out bucks for.Balt Fosco, Queens NY"
2,doesn't have many recipes for your run-of-the-mill vegetable,"I purchased this book hoping to find some meatless entrees to fit into my regular non-vegan diet. There are a few recipes for your run-of-the-mill veggies like broccoli, cabbage, corn and string beans. Most of the book is dedicated to vegetables like truffles, watercress, sorrel, salsify, rutabagas, cardoons and fiddlehead ferns, to name a few. I was disappointed with the small number of recipes that I would consider using in such a large and expensive book."
4,I was surprised at how good this was,"This book exceeded my expectations. It was very good, as to teaching technique and in providing excellent recipes. I don't understand why one person said it was devoted to hard-to-procure vegetables. There were plenty of recipes for the ""run of the mill"" veggies. Especially nice was that I discovered vegetables I thought I hated (only a few) that were delicious when prepared differently... like turnips. I loved the turnips glazed with a little butter, sugar and sherry. Who knew? I went through all the root vegetables in my refrigerator, using the same process with slight alterations. As a novice cook, I really appreciated some of the amazingly easy and repeatable techniques that were taught in this book... I look forward to making more things, and I am getting more of his books."
2,My family usually likes broccoli,"I tried the the basic steamed broccoli recipe because it had a new twist, so I thought I'd give it a try. I thought that a very easy dish would be a fair test for the book. It was way too salty, and not palatable. Sad, because my family likes that veg! Cooking is something I'm passionate about as I make dinner 5-6 time a week, and I'm not talking mac'n cheese.The physical quality of the book is poor, the paper is the high acid type that will yellow and crumble quickly, and visually lacking. I feel sorry for the author because the few photos in the book look like something from a 70's Better Homes and Gardens, which my mom still has, which inspired me to cook beyond that stuff.I'd suggest the CIA books instead, as the recipes are better tasting and have some cred.Ruth Reichl's Gourmet cook book is a real winner, too, and never disappoints... good for the average kitchen."
5,To Cook Vegetables Well...,"This is the perfect cookbook about vegetables. It isn't just a collection of recipes. It describes how best to cook each vegetable for the best flavor and then has several recipes to try for each--some simple, some not so simple. I refer to this one often for the chart in the front for steaming/cooking times for vegetables and information.If you are looking for a more seasonal cookbook with lots of recipes, then I would suggest Simply in Season. Honestly, the two cookbooks would make a great combination together if you want to incorporate more vegetables in season into your diet!If you find that you really like James Peterson, his other cookbooks are also outstanding! Essentials of Cooking is a great place to start--it teaches all the basics of gourmet cooking."
5,Variety is the Spice in Life,"Love, love love this book. Great for gifts. Give practical how to information for vegetables you have never heard of--how to buy and prepare. Will increase your use in the food pyramid."
4,WOW,"I had to watch this for school, but am glad I did. My boyfriend and I were rivited. To imagine how long ago it was shown-Murrow is a genious."
1,can't wait to get rid of it!,"I do not like this mascara at all!!! I bought it because it came in a pack of two and it was cheap! I have owned other Maybelline products before and had good experiences, so I thought I should try this as I had run out of my neutrogena mascara....I can't wait to get rid of this product!! It clumps and smudges like crazy! and it's EXTREMELY hard to take off! and even then I wake up the next day with racoon eyes!I do not recommend it!"
3,"Hitch Receiver, not an extension","I was looking for a 2"" x 6"" hitch receiver extension, something that would fit into my hitch receiver, so that I could insert something else into the extension, however this is actually a hitch receiver itself (the label on the item also calls it a hitch receiver). It will not fit into a 2"" receiver. The picture is accurate and it was my mistake purchasing this item. I returned it for a refund and had to purchase an actual hitch receiver extender."
2,ginger,whew...I wish someone had told me how SPICY HOT ginger is! I ordered this big bag to take to help my hot flashes but it is so spicy that I can't eat enough to make any difference... so I can't tell you if it works or not
5,Recommended,I always enjoy anything written by McGuiggan. His commentary on Ezekiel is very informative and thorough. I would highly recommend the book for anyone studying the book of Ezekiel and looking for a good commentary.
4,A do-it-yourself jewelry-making education,"This book explains many jewelry-making techniques in clear, well-illustrated step-by-step fashion. It's designed so that making the projects in order will teach increasingly complicated techniques, building skills as you go. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that some of the author's jewelry designs don't appeal to me, but the teaching methods are sound and the projects can easily be modified."
5,Jewelry Making: Tips and Tricks of the Trade,"Initially, I borrowed this book from a friend with the idea of making a few of the items and then returning the book. It was such a wonderful book that I ordered one for myself. We do a small jewelry business and the ideas are unique, easy to do and are wonderful. The book provides a complete list of supplies and detailed instructions and sketches along with photos of the finished product. I highly recommend this book for anyone with basic jewelry making skills, or novices who want instruction."
5,Excellent!,"This book is really excellent for a beginner (and others) - it shows complete jewellery making projects (wearable jewellery!) and all the steps necessary to make them, with lots of pictures, everything well explained."
3,Good But For Fans Only,"Aimee Mann is a terrific artist - she's one of my all time favourites and I own virtually all her work going back to 'Til Tuesday - but she needs to show more personality & presence to be a truely compelling stage performer. The DVD interviews allude to her unease on stage, so this probabaly isn't a surprise.The band is so professional - and the arrangements virtually the same as the CDs - that there really isn't much audible difference between these performances and the original CDs. Some people like this, picture perfect renditions of the orginal songs, but I find it uninteresting in a live context. Shake up those arrangements, let the band stretch out a bit!By the way, unlike many (most?) pop performers, Aimee can really sing live, that was nice to see.So I like this performance DVD, the music is great, it's just not a great live show."
2,just ok.Just for hardcore fans.,"Aimee Mann is that kind of artist that most of the time get away with good reviews.Her music is fair and harmless.But her pleasant voice doesn't sound so pleasant when she is performing live.Aimee and her band perform like a band in a studio,playing safe and exactly like it was recorded.Aimee admits on the interview that she doesn't like to tour so much;and that's the impression we get.The audience looks like a net full of dead fish.Once in a while they go""Whoo-hoo"" to Aimee's uncomfortable small-talk.A harmless dvd...something to ""leave in the background ""while you're cooking."
2,No more from Aimee.,"Go back to the studio,please.After the awful ""Lost in Space SE"" (the live album) and this dvd, I hope she's done.Buy one of her albums."
4,my only complaint is that some albums are under represented.,"If you've seen aimee mann live you'll want ot get this. if you havent seen her live you'll still want to get this. her songs, in live performance, are a great balance between record quality and having the energy and spontineity that only a live performance can provide. this dvd reflects that.the dvd was recorded over 3 nights, but this is not apparent when watching. it has a continuity that makes it feel like one full concert. the song selection is almost perfect. my only complaint is that her most successful album, her masterpiece bachelor #2 has only 3 of it's songs appear in this concert. it just seems like sucha shame. o well.. cant have everything."
4,At Long Last - Aimee Mann 'Live',"If you like Aimee Mann, you will love this CD/DVD..The songs are strong and the delivery impeccable. Stand-Out tracks are 'Wise Up', 'Save Me', 'Stupid Thing' and 'Deathly'...I would have liked to see more interaction with the crowd but then with Aimee, she tends to let the songs do the talking..A good collection for both the fans and the casual music lover."
1,High Maintenance? Hardly.,"While this book had brights spots of solid writing, overall, the plot was largely boring and unrealistic and the protagonist insipid. Liv gets married when she is roughly 21 (what Manhattanite does that these days?), divorced at 26 and then immediately takes up with a crude, obnoxious, quasi-sadistic paramour with a penchant for biting. I oscillated between annoyance and indifference."
1,A huge waste of time!,"This book was bad but I thought I'd stick with it to the end anyway. Liv and Andrew are not very interesting characters, we hardly even get to know Liv throughout the book. The ending wasn't even very spectacular, I felt like I invested in my time with this book & got nothing in return. I would not read anything else by this author. Luckily, I came across a 5 star book, called ADDICTED, after this disaster...Thank god I didn't pay for it. I'll gladly return it to the library."
2,Strange and stupid...but laughable,"This was the strangest and stupidest book I have ever read. Liv (the main character) does not in any way inspire a single woman, or recently divorced woman. Her life after divorcing her husband (Jack) gets more entangled and more ridiculous as you continue to read. I have a hard time putting down a book and not finishing it, and luckily this book did provide some laugh-out-loud moments as you realized just how stupid the story line is. The author seemed to ramble and the story jumped-around between flashbacks and current life entirely too much. I did not care that Liv remembered some strange smell from her childhood while looking at some pothole in front of her, and I did not care about her childhood at all in this story.I have read worse books, but not many, and will NOT recommend this book to anyone I know."
2,UNREALISTIC,"Although there were some enjoyable parts, I am surprised to find so many good reviews for this book. I did like Liv's sarcastic sense of humor but much of the book was so unrealistic that I couldn't relate. I prefer stronger female characters who do not stay with wierd unattactive married men who bite their ear's off! Also, the part about the gun seemed unrealistic even for Liv!!"
1,Just not my sense of humor,"I couldn't get into this book. I got maybe 30 pages and quit because I can't stand the main character's sense of humor. It may be called ""gritty"" or ""edgy"" but I think that it's immature and twisted."
1,Not funny or clever,"I read this book because somewhere it said it was the American version of Bridget Jones' Diary. All I can say is that this main character is really messed up. She was so frustrating, wimpy and whiny. I found it stange and stupid, but certainly not laughable."
3,Crude humour but clever and funny too,"This book was recommended by my friend when I was looking for something light to read. The writing is clever and funny and I liked how she sort of abbreviated the chapter headings e.g.Zen Loft-Back on Mrkt. It's a satirical look at some aspects of life in NYC especially real estate. I found myself laughing out loud, the characters are outrageous but there were lots of times that I found the humour a little crude or distasteful. For this reason I am yet to finish the book, that and the fact that I got sidetracked-I picked up Jennifer Weiner's Little Earthquakes from the library and that was a good read. I'll try and finish it though"
3,HIGH MAINTENANCE TO READ,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED. I had read such great reviews here on-line. I was really looking forward to a GREAT READ. Don't get me wrong, it held my attention throughout most of the book. It was a quick read. However, i found myself getting upset throughout the novel at Liv's acceptance and allowance of abuse. She was a beautiful woman, an intelligent business woman and allowed that craze-filled Andrew to destroy her.I did not find this book to be funny. On the contrary, I felt quick down while reading it. I was rooting for Liv to take control and take charge. I was actually scared for her at certain points of the book. I guess I was just looking forward to a light read and fun. However, I got much more. NOT MY KIND OF ENJOYMENT."
1,Unreadable,"I am struggling through this book in an attempt to find out why it is a bestseller, and so far, I have no idea. The writing is stilted, silly, high school writing class material (ie. the ""suitor"" play on words on page 28, and the ""jack"" play on words on page 4). The character cries a lot in inappropriate settings, the writer tries in vain to beat humor out of a blind character (""I considered telling him there was a rainbow out his window even though there wasn't. When someone is blind you will do anything to make their world better."") Really distasteful stuff. The main character is mean and unappealing, and the writing can't save her. If you're looking for a humorous book about a single woman, try reading Jane Green. Her writing is much funnier and less self-indulgent than Jennifer Belle's."
2,I guess if you like that kind of stuff,"I thought the characters were a bit unbelievable and unlikable. The whole story was too flighty for me (and the use of the ""c"" word was over the top). Wouldn't recommend it to my mother."
1,Possibly the Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. With pathetic characters and unrealistic situations, the least you could hope for are a few good laughs. Unfortunately, Jennifer Belle does not even deliver that in &#65533;High Maintenance.&#65533; The stories the main character, Liv, tells are uninteresting and irrelevant (and she has uses a lot of curse words). The plot is stupid, and I do not think there was an appropriate closing to all the drama the novel involves. After reading this book, you are left feeling empty and are not the least bit amused. Plus, I was wondering, &#65533;Was this book 350 pages? It felt like 1,350.&#65533;"
3,I give it three and a half stars.,"I give it a half star more than three because I simply prefer upbeat, ""happy"" stories better, but that doesn't mean this wasn't well written. Like others here I rooted for Liz and was repulsed by Andrew. I got the impression Liz thinks she's culturally superiour because she lives in NYC, and maybe she is. But she was also another abused woman with low self esteem. The nicest apartment with the best view won't change that.Not a waist of time for me. Just not my taste."
3,Being Inside A Comedy Club,"If comedy alone qualified a book as being a masterpiece, than ""High Maintenance"" would suffice, but the riotous humor doesn't have any accompanying seriousness of purpose in the storyline, so all the fluff feels unjustified. it was as if I went to a play and the stage wasn't set properly. The dialogues are a roaring, snazzy throwback to being inside a comedy club but... the main character never leaves the comedy club, not even for a breath of fresh air. That I never got the realistic edge I was looking for made it harder to view the writing as anything but ""stuff that instead of entertaining me just makes me tipsy."" If the middle of the book had introduced something more substantial than Andrew, Liv's boyfriend, telling Liv that he loves her because of the way she fumbles with the zipper on her red jacket.. Well, then the book might have been of more consequence. Conclusion: It was pretty good, but it was only two-dimensional."
3,vintage New York...what else is there to say?,"i found this book to be funny and entertaining yet borderline self-destructive. the main character Liv comes across as a sniveling spoiled brat, yet you want her to find just the right loft and the right man to inhabit it with her.i laughed out loud at her antics while looking for employment. we should all maybe so lucky to become employed by someone who is blind so that all the eye-rolling, ugly stares, strategic middle finger manuevers and such would allow us to vent with out being fired!a good sohpmoric attempt, but hopefully next time we will really like the enitre work, and not just small scenes taken from the big picture."
2,A True Disappointment,"A self-proclaimed aficianado of books told from a quriky single woman's perspective, I had high expectations for Jennifer Belle's sophmore effort. What I found instead were truly disagreeable characters strung together by a flimsy plot. A sad, mean-spirited novel."
3,Another NY dating story,"The main character in this book had real potential. However, she was paired with so many other unrealistic characters that I found her motivations hard to understand. Belle's writing style is gutsy and blunt, which was interesting and flowed well with the tone of the novel. However, the single-woman working and dating in NY is becoming a common girlie-novel theme: one that I admittedly enjoy. However, I thought that ""Good in Bed"" and the ""Nanny Diaries"" were more clever novels along that genre."
3,Thought I hated it but I couldn't put it down...,"I liked Liv, but I suspect she suffers from low self-esteem. Only that could explain her relationship with Andrew -- a short, chubby detestable sex-crazed biter who is despicably cheap and lives with someone else. I also detested her first boss Dale but at least we lost her in the first part of the book.Like I said, I told my husband I didn't like the book, but darn it, I couldn't put it down either. It was entertaining and funny in places. I really give it 3 1/2 stars."
3,Thought I hated it but I couldn't put it down...,"I liked neurotic Liv, but I suspect she also suffers from low self-esteem. Only that could explain her relationship with Andrew -- a short, chubby detestable sex-crazed biter who is despicably cheap and lives with someone else. I also detested her first boss Dale but at least we lost her in the first part of the book. The scenes with her gun are amusing.I told my husband I didn't like the book, but darn it, I couldn't put it down either. It was entertaining and funny in places (though I only laughed out loud once).I really give it 3 1/2 stars."
1,I can't even finish it,"Maybe it is unfair to review a book without having finished it, but sometimes life is not fair. This book (I am on page 190) is so boring! A few clever, witty, cute lines does not make a novel. Liv leaves her husband, gets into real estate, and makes three huge deals right away - how unrealistic. Her boyfriend is an uncouth moron and what she sees in him is curious to me. All she does is show apartments and see her boyfriend. BORING! Where is this book going anyway? Forget about plot- there isn't even a story! Boring characters. Who cares about Liv? I don't."
1,Horrible,"I was really looking forward to this book, but I should have just left it at the store. It's hard to get interested in because none of the characters have much depth...the author did a really bad job at giving them some ""character."" I finally just stopped reading about half-way through the book because I realized I was just wasting my time. I really hated it."
2,My opinion of this book is going down...,"Liz is the stereotypical rich shallow New Yorker who loses everything and then gets it all back within ten minutes. She gets into an abusive relationship with a psychopath. She finds a gun, but never pulls the trigger. I just couldn't relate to anyone in this book. So silly."
2,This book is just odd...,"I have read so many good books in the last year and this is just not one of them. The characters are not quirky, they're weird. Neither Andrew nor Liv are all that developed and I can't say that I like either one of them. The author doesn't give you any reason to like them. And what was the curtain stealing all about?This book is just odd. It was hard to get through and the end wasn't all that spectacular. If you still feel the need to read it, borrow it from the library or call me. You can definitely have my copy."
4,Just short of wonderful,"After reading 'Going Down' within a matter of hours, loving every word, enjoying my infatuation with its main character (actually, both main characters--Bennington and New York), and appreciating Belle's writing, I wouldn't have missed this book for anything. It was very good, and very worth the effort and time it took to read it. My main gripe about this book was my horrible distaste for the main character's newfound boyfriend. I hated him, and in every instance he appeared I wanted someone--anyone--to smack him. (I won't give away the end of the book, so I'll stop now.) Belle is a wonderful writer, and I found Liv (the main character) to be very appealing, but I do think Belle could have easily, given her talent, developed her character with a few more quirks. I recommend this book to anyone who liked 'Going Down,' and anyone who likes modern NYC novels. I can't wait for Belle's next...."
3,"A bit disappointed, but still not a bad read.","I was looking forward to reading Ms. Belle's follow up book from Going Down, which I totally enjoyed. I felt this book wasn't up to snuff but still entertaining. I did not really care what happened to Liv after a while during the book, her ill choices in men and flaky attitude I couldn't identify with. I could not feel sorry for a character who could at will just drop one expensive New York apartment for another just like that, an unrealisitc option for most of us living in Manhattan! Despite these flaws the book was entertaining and funny as hell. Recommend."
2,"A Chorus Line Rating of: Humor 10, Plot 2","It's the summer and if you want lite reading and a book with great one-liners and a quick read, this will pass your time on the subway or the beach. The plot is incredibly weak but this girl is witty, funny and has some LOL lines. Jennifer Belle is clearly bright and how the potential to pull it all together. She doesn't quite do it here but her quickness gets you through it. If you're looking for prose, or literature don't bother picking it up. At times her humor reminded me of Carrie Fisher's books which were also high in the humore department and weak in plot."
4,Strange but good,"Jennifer Belle definitely has a much different style of writing than other featured ""chic lit"" writers. Although this book is funny at parts, it has a sense of darkness throughout the whole novel. The main character, Liv Kellerman, while recently separated from her husband, struggles in NYC with her rundown apartment, new job as a real estate agent, and a jerk of a boyfriend. I'd have to say I was rather impressed with Belle's writing; at times it is very moving and beautiful...so much so that I wondered why she writes in this particular genre. If you were a big fan of Bridgette Jones or other funny female characters, this might not be the book for you because this main character isn't exactly funny in a light, whimsical way. She's funny at times in a dark, sick way. Overall I enjoyed this book although it may not be the kind of lighthearted read I assumed it to be."
2,Kept Waiting,It never gets better. With each page I turned I had hope. The characters are flat and I could not connect.
2,"Just OKAY, really had to struggle to make it to the end!","I really had to struggle to not put the book down and start another one. The main charachter Liv was just so strange and selfish. I did not feel sorry for her, nor did I care about what she was going through, since it seemed that she deserved to have no real friends or anyone to turn to... at the end it turned around a bit, but honestly, she was just so 'off'. I should have expected this, as I did read 'GOING DOWN' and found the heroine to be 'off'... but this was supposed to be funny, and the underlying storyline of the handgun just seemed so strange to me. The boyfriend Adam was just terrible in every way, I was glad when he was finally gone! I would not recommend this book, as I struggled through it myself- a quick read - but there are so many great books out there to read, this just was not one of them, I am surprised itw as a bestseller."
1,Can I give it 1/2 of a star instead of a full one?,"The characters were so ridiculously weird and the things that happened in this book were so, so bad. This book was so bad that I not only gave up on it 3/4 of the way through (which I NEVER do), but I tore pages out of it before I threw it away just to make sure that nobody else would be subjected to it again... How could ANYONE find this book amusing?"
3,what size?,why is the size from the title: Park B. Smith Plush Spa 66 x 22-Inch Rug.... different than what's listed in the product dimensions..... help?
2,Disappointed!!,"Fisher Price Kid Tough FP3 Song & Story Player - BlueGot this for my son for Christmas. Had a hard time getting the music to download. Had to change batteries twice in one day. Total meltdown/tantrum...Merry Christmas! I'm sending it back and getting a small, cheaper MP3. I really thought this would be a good fit for my son because of the durability and ease to use but The issues we've had aren't worth it."
3,BEWARE! NOT VISTA COMPATIBLE!,"If you have windows vista, this wont work for you. Don't buy it until it is updated! You wont be able to add or delete any songs or stories. Sometimes songs skip or stop but can be corrected, if you have xp or older."
2,NOT COMPATABLE WITH VISTA,"NOWHERE on the packaging is this mentioned!! My husband and I spent a couple of hours trying to load the software and get it to run with no avail. I went and checked out other reviews on Amamzon and found others saying the same thing. Great toy, antiquated software. Use a neighbors/family members XP operating system or send it back!!"
3,wish I had known...,"This product is cute and a lot of fun for my 3 year old daughter. My only complaint so far is that it is not compatible with Windows Vista. Thankfully we had an old computer in the house with Windows XP and I was able to download songs onto the player. Also, songs that I had downloaded from the Internet were not able to be transferred unless I burned them onto a CD first ( a little time consuming but it worked.) I hope that Fisher Price comes up with a software that is compatible with Windows Vista soon!!! My daughter loves it and carries it around where ever she goes. She has even began to appreciate the 80's! Rock on!!"
5,We LOVE this item - at least my 3 yr old son does,"I really do love this item. The songs that came on it were terrible, but it was easy to download my own. I even downloaded some from the fisher-price site. Also very easy and not expensive. My son loves some Top 40 type songs and country music: Aint no other man, Riding Dirty, Fast Cars and Freedom. I put a different icon for each song so he can easily (visually) scan his FP3 for the song he wants. I even put the theme song for Wonder Pets and he was so excited. I have one for my 4 yr old daughter also. She likes the stories best, but again the stories that came with the FP3 were terrible. I downloaded some Dr. Suess stories and the songs for my son and she loves hers too. Terrific item and we have had no problems. Thanks FIsher Price."
2,disapointed twice,"This toy is such a great idea, but the player I bought for my son's Birthday stopped working after 24 hours. I figured I just bought a lemon so I called the company and they very kindly replaced it with a new one. After 24 hours of very gentle use by my son, it is freezing up every time he tries to listen to music. The stories work (so far), but we can no longer get it to play music. I know some of these must work by all the positive reviews, but what are the odds of getting two duds in a row??"
4,son loves it,My son wanted this so bad or christmas and he got it! He loves it. It comes with some storys and music on it and you can upload what ever you want on it.
2,Fisher-Price FP3 - Very Lame Software,"The Fisher-Price Kid Tough FP3 Player seems like a good idea - and it has some great features. It's tough, and the headset operates at a modest level for little ears. But for the adults that have to support it, it's a nightmare!!Fisher-Price has made it very difficult and time consuming to copy your own music to this device. They actually expect you to burn a cd with your music, and then you can copy it to the player. Now, the CD's are not that expensive, but the time required to do this , especially for a large number of tunes, is horrible.To make matters even worse, and more frustrating, you can't even copy your own icons into the player. You can draw one, using their software - assuming that you can draw. But you can't import or copy an icon into the software for use on the player.All in all, this player is a huge disappointment, and has thoroughly ruined Fisher-Price's reputation for fune products, as far as I'm concerned."
2,Too quiet,"The idea behind this toy is great & ours has lived up to its durability claim. My husband did not complain about adding songs to it, so it could not have been too bad. Batteries: this eats through them like crazy - and we used Duracell. Volume: the idea of volume control is good, but the highest volume is way too low. I can't even hear anything until I get it to the mid-setting. My 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn, but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones. We probably should not have bought this until next year, maybe Fisher Price will have improved it by then."
2,quality not good - replaced 2x without succes,"We had 2 of these products and had the same problem with both. It would shut down and hang often enough that it was simply not useable. We thought we had gotten a defective one the first time around, so we returned it for a new one - with the same problem! The battery indicator would jump all over the place from full to empty with no rhyme or reason. When it hung, you had to get out a mini screwdriver to remove and replace the batteries (with the same ones) for it to re-start. Although the concept was good, and it was nice for my 3 year old to pick music out by the icons (since she can't read), it was not of the quality we expected. Our daughter is very gentle with her toys, so this was not an issue of her beating on the player. It was not cheap for a kid's toy, and we expected more. My husband got so frustrated with it that he just threw it in the trash and we are now on the hunt for a new MP3 player."
1,Hate It! Hate It! Hate It!,I hate this PF3 player more than I hate anything else in my life right now! I have spent upward of 100 hours trying to load songs from CDs onto it. First of all because it is a PF3 player not an MP3 player it does not automatically title the songs so you have to go in and rename every song you put on it!!!! If Fisher Price had only paid for the MP3 files it would be a great product. But as is it is the most frustrating thing I have ever worked with!!
4,Great beginning music player - it saved mommy's ipod from destruction,"I bought this for my son as a third birthday present for completely selfish reasons, to save him from ruining my ipod.I love this player and so does he! My favorite thing about this player is the volume control never gets so high that it hurts his ears.There are a few things I found challenging, such as deleting the pre-loaded music and stories, which are not to our taste, but overall this player suits his needs and keeps him away from my i-pod.The one thing you have to remember is the player doesn't use an MP3 format so all imported cd's have to run through the Fisher Price software. If you're familiar with iTunes, this will be fairly easy for you to do, just be patient because it does take a few minutes to complete this.All is right with the world. Thank you Fisher Price."
5,My Son Loves this Item,"My now [...]son can't live without this. We bought it for him for x-mas and he hasn't spent a day without it. We loaded it with Fisher Price music and stories and he loves it. Now we download songs that he wants to hear (to disc) and load them onto his FP3 player, that way we don't need the radio in the car. We control what he hears and he gets the music and stories he loves. We bought the speakers that go along with the small player so he can ""share"" his music with us. Now we all listen to the stories and music together. It's a great addition. Don't worry, all of the products are very durable, it's been dropped several times..."
2,Constellation-al ain't sensational,"Hoover S3345 Constellation Vacuum Cleaner works fine on wood floors. It does a good job with the small brush and crevice tools also. BUT, it is ineffective, virtually worthless, on carpet, I should have read Consumer Reports first. I am very disappointed with this product."
1,This is the worst vacuum I have ever owned.,The carpet attachment is cheaply made and very expensive to replace. It was broken within three months. The hose has numerous tears in it that I have taped until I can purchase a new vacuum. I have owned it less than 2 years. Very disappointed with this product.
3,Stylish vacuum cleaner with some design and quality flaws,"This is a stylish vacuum cleaner, and I like the way it floats on air (however, one must be careful not to sling it into something by moving too fast). It also has a lot of power. However, it makes significantly more noise than I would have expected, and the tiny dust filter got clogged within less than a minute and had to be cleaned repeatedly when I used the S3345 to clean up after sanding a sheetrock wall. I think the dust filter is too small, and it would be helpful to have a button for reducing the power of the motor for this kind of activity. Another problem area is the on/off switch, which needs so much force that I am always afraid to break it. This problem seems to be getting worse, although I haven't switched my S3345 on and off more than 20 times so far."
2,Disapointed,"This vaccum works very well on our hardwood floor. I'm satisfied of that. But it has two vital faults : 1)There is no wire-tiding up system. One has to intertwine the wire manually on the bottom. This final job is very arduous. 2) It drifts too much when working. Sometimes it is difficult to control its direction. Finally, it is rather a problem instead of helping."
3,pretty good,"I have a mixed review for this one. The content is top notch and i definitely enjoyed it. However, when I started to read it it started coming apart at the binding. I did not put the book under any undue stress, just normal, gentle reading and it fell apart. This of course upset me and has made me very hesitant to purchase the others in the series."
2,Be warned....,"The content is great. However, the binding is easily the worst I have ever seen in a professionally produced book. The ENTIRE book came apart upon its first reading! Don't expect to pass this down to your grandkids."
2,It is really disappointment for me,I am using this camcoder for about 5 months. The following spesifications have disappointed me:1.the quality of the movie which is shot at low light level is bad.2.The night shot movie is monocrom and the color of movie is very bad.3. the color night shot movies are not smooth.4. The quality of the movies which is transferred to the computer to make VCD or DVD is bad and the superimposing of the time or date to the movie is impossible.

3,Male academics dealing with the issue of gender,"In this anthology, male academics show that they have taken insights from women's studies seriously. They analyze gender blending, pro-feminism, being an ally, and a host of other issues. The gods of men's studies are all here: Messner, Kimmel, and Connell. There are great contributions from African-American critical thinkers as well. I didn't devour this book as voraciously as I thought I would, but it was still good. It's a welcome addition to the movement to show that those with male privilege can take feminism seriously too."
3,3PW Raven's Rules,"All matches are from the November 22, 2003 Raven's Rules card.CJ O'Doyle vs. Ricky Vega.Roadkill vs. Monsta Mack.Ruckus vs. Matt Striker.Low-Ki vs. Joey Matthews.Blue Meanie vs. Rob Eckos.Gary Wolfe vs. Damien Adams.Homicide vs. Xavier.Sandman vs. Sabu vs. Raven for the 3PW Title.Also, a bonus match........

1,Worthless,"This product is totally worthless for installing a stereo into a Jeep.It is the same plug that is already in the vehicle, not the one to go from the stereo to the factory Jeep plug.The wiring diagram is wrong also."
5,Wonderful book!,"A compelling book of hope, of comfort, of action -- a clear voice of reason in a confusing and sometimes frightening world. This book presents simple principles that are powerful enough to not only affect the way you view life experiences, but change your life if you apply them. The only person over whom you can hope to have any control is your own self. This book helps you see the possibilities of taking that control, no matter what else happens around you. Read the book, then apply the principles. You'll be happily surprised by the result."
2,Nothing Earth Shattering,"This is what I would label a ""to feel good"" book. Do these things and you will feel good about yourself. But do you really need a book to tell you how to act? In theory, they're lovely platitudes and you might have a brief period after reading them where you think of how you will put them into practice, if you're not already. A cynic by nature, I dare say that I don't believe all the little tales that went along with them but the tales in no way affect how you will feel toward the ""commandments"". Print them out if you want so you can read them occasionally to get a nice warm fuzzy feeling but I think your life would have to be void of all meaning for this to have much of an impact on you."
1,wrong part,I did a careful search and was told the part would fit my vehicle. The part I received was a raybestos part number 2091. The correct part for my 1998 GMC Safari is raybestos part number 2034. I was given a prompt refund and bought the parts elsewhere.
4,Risk rewarded,"This and other 3CD releases on Black Cat Records have only an Amazon blurb ""about the artist"" and no info about the recordings. Also this and many other 3CD offerings [presently] have no customer reviews. So it was a risk to make the purchase. Well I am very happy with this product. Although there is still no information given about the recordings [dates,location etc.] what you get are top notch selections with very good sound quality. By the way, I like the LP Jacket size case ----it is sturdy and I have had no problems popping the cds in and out. Based on my satisfaction with this Sarah Vaughan release I will be purchasing 3CD sets of other artists in this format."
2,Only the title is good,"This is a grade B movie--poor acting, poor lines, poor quality in general. A young Juan Gabriel plays the lead in this movie which depicts an (apparently true) segment of his life during which he was jailed for being wrongly arrested and convicted on a theft charge. It is during this time that he makes a contact which later leads to his artistic discovery. There are probably more poorly-acted fist-fights not involving Juan than music scenes. The music is of poor quality as well. Don't waste your money on this video; instead, spend it on Juan Gabriel's live performance videos which are truly exceptional."
2,A whole lot of errors.,"I checked the results of my son SSAT low level test. I faild to understand or got different answers on next math questions: Section 2, question 10; Section 2, question 15; Section 2, question 25; Section 4, question 16; Section 4, question 20; Yury Makedonov, Ph.D. (Physics and Mathematics)"
3,Russian rockabilly and psychobilly,"This compilation was released on Japan label, and it contains Psycho/Rockabilly bands from Russia and former USSR.If you like Russian scene - you can enjoy this. I listened to this comp only one time, and I don't need more. I like some songs, but the whole album is hard to listen."
5,A must read,"This is an extraordinary book. The best book on branding that I have read. (I have read almost all of them).Not only are the real world examples tied to two of the greatest brands in the world: Nike and Starbucks, but the author has a perspective on branding that I thought was keenly insightful and useful to almost anyone who needs to work with and understand brands.As a an owner of a marketing agency and a professor of strategic communications all I can say is I'm glad I read it (and wish that I had written it.)"
4,A must read for brand professionals,An easy and relevant read from a real brand expert. I loved reading the inside stories of top brands. Bedbury has a unique insider voice that makes it easy to understand and clear what we must do.
3,A really delightful read,"A New Brand world is mildly entertaining and provoking. It overdelivers in simple plain language and is easy to read. I finished reading this book within a few hours during my flight. I would highly recommend this book to any advertising, marketing or branding expert. It's really good and easy to comprehend and there are lots of real life situations thrown in as well. Plus I got this book at less than USD 10 ! A real bargain !"
3,Woody gives us a woody !,"Some great compositions here from Nick Wood , mostly music associated to his TV and Film work commercials in Japan where his state of the art recording studio is Syn - Nishi-Azabu Tokyo.Nick is an colourful artist with alot of heart . Watch out for this man , he's bound to come out with some brilliant stuff in the near future . My favourite track is My Island and Cupid is a Hitman . We played them on heavy rotation on Bondi 88.0FM ""The Prawn Lounge"" amongst other programs during December Sydney 2001 soon after its release and took many calls from listeners.Sydney Australia. Rock on Regent Wood keep it happenin!"
4,Kickin CD (leave yer politics at home... ),"Best cd i've ever gotten for under a buck. cupid's a hitman??? infectious melodies, good rhythms. it's ambient, dance, chillout, soundtrack, jazz. absolutely brilliant. as for the comments about clinton? who gives a flyin' fork! (putz that he wuz)"
4,buy this album,"A great addition to rap-a-lot records. In my opinion Tela doesn't get the kind of credit he deserves. This album is a huge boost from his previous release ""now or never"". The album starts off with the bass pounding single ""TELA"" which is sure to blow your speakers out. Followed by ""Bye Bye haters"" which to me is the best cut on there where he sends a strong message with lines like ""Haters can't see me, cause haters don't like meWe two different players: I'm gator, you Nike."" ""Table Dance"" and ""Show nuff"" are true bangers, but also adds a twist to the album with the song ""drugs"" featuring talented and underated artist Devin the dude in which he spits humorous lines that he usually boasts. Overall the album is solid. He probably could have done away with the skits but overall, i recommend this album. Even though the album dropped 4 years ago its still in heavy rotation to this day. Go out and cop this album...........i'm out."
4,RAP-A-LOT 2K !,"TRACK 12 WITH A.K. AND MONEY MARU IS OFF THE HOOK. A.K. IS FROM THE WESTSIDE OF CHI-TOWN,OTHER PEOPLE KNOW HIM AS A MEMBER OF DO OR DIE.RAP-A-LOT IS DOING GOOD FOR THEMSELVES,NOW TELA CAME INTO THE GAME NOW RAP-A-LOT IS ONE OF THE TOP RECORD COMPANY IN THE U.S.A..RAP-A-LOT WAS BIG EVER SINCE SCARFACE CAME OUT.TELA DIDN'T MAKE RPLT BIG,BUT HE DID GIVE THEM ALOT MORE POWER IN THE RAP GAME."
3,This CD is not really a good one,"I like this CD,but it's somethin I didn't expect than in his previous album Now or Never,Tela put his old mixes in it, Sho Nuff and Table Dance.Plus the CD is short,and it shouldn't have a skit or a short intro.His rap skills is pretty wack, he raps a little too slow,and sometimes he stops for 1 or 2 seconds,miss half of a line.I like Scarface the Last of A Dying Breed better, but Tela is one of my favorite rappers,but I don't like to see or hear him drop down like that."
5,Compatible with a 1999 Chevrolet Prizm as well!,"After reading some forums, I found out that this kit should be compatible with my 1999 Chevrolet Prizm. It worked out great in my car and I was even able to keep my slide out cup holder since it mounts to the bottom of the kit. To install for your 1999 Prizm, follow the directions for what tabs to remove for a 2002. You'll also have to bend or cut half of the top plastic plate(it has a crease on the back side so you know where to cut) above where your after-market deck goes or the factory trim piece won't fit. I also purchased theScosche Im01B Universal Wiring Harness For 1990 and Up Importswhich worked great to convert the factory wiring to my after-market stereo."
2,"instructions not clear, didn't fit either","I bought this for my 2002 Chevrolet Prizm to install my aftermarket stereo. It has no supports for the stereo to stay level, also the screwholes on the product and the on my Prizm were not a perfect fit, but at least 1"" off. Ended up tearing it apart trying to get it to work. Waste of money."
5,Hold Downs,Works great if you have t-slots. Be nice if they would include a rail that would fit a miter slot as well. But does what they are supposed to do.
3,Usefull but awkward to use,I have been using these featherboards for a little while now both on my router table and on my table saw fence.They do there job but I find it awkward and time consuming to set them up because of the non parallel slots.
2,Came without the track bars,"Maybe I didn't review it closely enough, but this product shipped without the bars to allow it to track in my table saw. Should have been more clearly evident."
2,bait and hook,"I imagine they might have a good product but their marketing sucks.I expect to take something out of a box and begin using it. You pay for a product and you should get something that works.Once you try to use this, it doesn't adapt to your saw. Upon investigation, you need to purchase the adaptor which they offer for another $10 as I remember. Thats not what I expect from a business. I thought being made in the usa was good but I'd rather buy something chinese that I can use.Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
1,Buy another featherboard that has two hold downs in parallel slots!!!!,"These featherboards looked good so I bought. In use they are hard to adjust because the slots are not parallel and the bolts bind. Because the slots get closer as you move the fingers closer to the blade, the featherboard has more leverage on it and is not that stable. They should have kept the slots parallelAlso, featherboards only work when the fingertips are parallel to the fence and these are hard to adjust.The other problem is only one of the bolt knobs actually cause the miter track to expand to hold the featherboard in!! This is the biggest problem. The other bolt only pulls the orange plastic down to the track but does not expand in the slot. So there is always some rotational play in the featherboard.The bottom line is-- this is an expensive featherboard with two insurmontable problems, so keep looking."
2,I agree with the other reviews.,"Update: Amazon has the Bench Dog 10-012 Miter Slot Adapter for about 10 bucks. I purchased it. It's some type of metal. Much better than the plastic that came with the set originally. It slides much better than the cheap plastic miter slot adapter. It should have been standard.Once you get them setup for the cut, they work well. But as others have stated, they are not well thought out or easy to use. The black handle has stripped out from the bolt top and is now useless. I would not purchase these again. I think I can buy the replacement pieces to fix the stripped out problem but what the heck, I have only used them a couple dozen times and they need repairs?I recently found some mag lock feather boards at Rockler (i think). I'll be looking for reviews on those."
3,Bench Dog's Quality Control sucks,"I have not had time to use these yet (I just received them yesterday) but I've already had to return them. in the original shipment, the threads were damaged on one of the wing nuts. In the replacement shipment, TWO wing nuts had damaged threads. so between the two shipments, I do have a functional pair of featherboards.Three damaged parts in two packages causes me to have serious concerns about purchasing anything expensive made by Bench Dog...once I've had a chance to actually use the product, I'll provide an update to this review."
1,Returned them.,"Would be no stars but Amazon does not allow you to leave 0 stars. I returned them. Read the reviews here carefully. These can't be used with a table saw without buying extra parts at about $20. The needed extra parts have issues. See the reviews of the adapter. That may work for you, but I would not have purchased had I known that I needed extra parts and that the parts may or may not work with a standard table saw miter slot. Also note the comments about the knobs stripping with table saw use. Some say you can contact Bench Dog for new knobs."
3,poor quality,"I am really disappointed with the design of this product. The black plastic knobs broke (tore out) the first time I used them. Bench Dog apparently has a good name, but the two products I have purchased have had major problems. Too much hype.UPDATE: I called Bench Dog. Their manufacturer changed the design on the knobs. Call Bench Dog--they send free replacements for the knobs with the original design that doesn't tear out."
4,Pretty good stuff...1 small complaint,"I have owned several of these for about 5 years and use them daily. They are easy to set and use and rugged. Only 1 thing prevents me from giving them 5 stars. They don't give a tight enough fit in the miter slot. They hold well enough to prevent sliding in the slot but they don't hold well enough to prevent lifting them out of the slot. When I set them firmly against the piece I'm cutting, I can't lift the wood without lifting the feather board out of the slot. They should be made with T-slot bars. But this is a minor inconvenience that does not diminish the value of the item. I recommend them."
1,Poor design,Similar complaints to other reviewers. Fingers are too stiff. Non-parallel slots are awkward to adjust. Miter slot bar only expands and tightens at one end and thus can pivot out of the slot. I bought some Kreg featherboards that are much much better.
2,Bench Dog Featherboard,"Take these back to the drawing board Bench Dog!Let me start by saying I love my Bench Dog router plate, but these featherboards are way too stiff. You usually can't even force the material past the featherboards. Back off slightly, and they offer no contact at all. I have used cheap plastic featherboards before, and really liked them. These are way too stiff. Every so often I take them to the band saw and cut off another plastic finger - still too stiff.Also the non-parallel slots are not well designed. This is minor compared with the stiff fingers.Two things I do like about these...1. They are plenty long, so they reach the router fence in any position.2. They indicate feed direction, so when your brother in law borrows your router table he won't hurt himself.Try another brand, these aren't any good."
2,too stiff,Same complaint as most everyone else. They seem fine at first but I quickly grew to hate the stiff fingers and you have to tighten them so hard in order to prevent them from slipping that you will eventually end up stripping the bolt/knob. The other thing that is really irritating is that you have to buy the miter slides separately! they end up costing way too much.
3,Needed some modifications,"I got mine a couple of years back and had to do some metal machining (a file did the trick) to get the unit to work as I wanted without binding or slipping, and I also added washers to allow the clamps knobs to work more effectively. The thing now works just fine. I might give the Kreg version a try, but this one is lower in price.Howard Ferstler"
4,Doesn't fit my Porter Cable,"Just FYI. I have a Porter Cable table saw that I purchase from Lowes. Probably, had I done the work to figure out beforehand whether these would fit it, I'd not be writing this review. It doesn't fit the Porter Cable, so I had to return. While I had it in-hand, it looked like a good product sufficient for what it was designed for."
2,"good product, fast shipping, dishonest customer service","All customer service is signed by Ron Manz, President, but it's not him. Any number of customer service agents are 'round the clock claiming their solutions are his. The product was fine, and arrived quickly. However, it was frozen when it was claimed fresh, and customer service was to give me a refund, again by Ron Manz. None arrived. After inquiring, ""Ron Manz"" said he ""forgot,"" and sent me a credit receipt via email. That's not a refund, even though ""Ron"" asked me for my Credit Card # once again. My bank account still shows no refund. Avoid this company like the plague, folks. They're misrepresenting themselves and their products."
2,Not worth the money,"We bought four pedi spas from Sanijet. They were not the portable kind but the ones that fit into a floor-level counter top.They were also pipeless with two motors in each spa. We've had to replace four motors to date.Two were replaced under the original warranty. We have now ordered two more and are checking our records to see if they were the ones that were replaced under the original warranty.The labor is not covered so the cost of installing the replacement motors is on us.Furthermore, the tubs themselves are susceptible to corrosion if you use bath salts, a practice done at many pedicure businesses. We were forced to resurface the units because they became severely discolored and gritty.We have a high volume business and require that the spas be reliable. We do not consider these units to be reliable. We don't think they are worth the $1999 either.If your business depends on the units, we would counsel you to look for a competing product."
5,The Final Storm,"In this thrilling closer of the Door Within Trilogy, Paragor, the Sleepers, and the Wyrm Lord join together in a breathtaking war against King Eliam and the King of Alleble. The only hope for the Allebians are the 3 witnesses, who are no where to be found. Aidan, Antoinnette, and Robby come together to fight for the protection of Alleble.This book, in my opinion, is full of excellent magic and battles, well written, and outstanding plot. Not many faults riddle the pages, and the back and forth chapters kept me on edge, always wanting it to continue when it changed.Never alone!"
5,Great story,"In The Final Storm, Book Three of the Door Within Trilogy, Kearn, Robbie's Glimpse, has captured Antoinette. Aidan has asked Antoinette to try to get Kearn to reject The Dark Prince and turn to good King Eliam, and she tries, but he isn't interested. It's a troubled time in the kingdom of Alleble. The armies of the Dark Prince are on the move, and The Wyrm Lord is free.Back in the natural world, Aidan tries to convince Robbie that The Realm actually exists. While they are talking Aidan is pulled back into the Realm. The battle of the ages is building. Will King Eliam win, or will victory go to The Dark Prince?Although this series is described as teen fiction, readers of all ages will enjoy these books. I finished book three with regret that it was the end of the series. I strongly recommend The Door Within, The Rise of the Wyrm Lord, and The Final Storm. All three are great reading."
4,The End Is Coming...,"This is an explosive finale to an amazing trilogy. I read it from start to finish with hardly any breaks in between.It's just as enjoyable as all of Mr. Batson's books, although the ending wasn't the kind of ending I like. I'm not giving anything away--that would defeat the purpose.Who knows? I'm sure most people loved the ending. It's just not my kind of ending.Anyway. The characters are just as intriguing as before, and so are the new characters. The Seven Sleepers are properly chilling, and provide dangerous foes for the heroes of the story.All in all, this was an amazing book! Don't judge my four-stars; that's just because of the slight unsatisfaction I felt at the ending. : ) This is truly a spectacular book."
5,An Epic Conclusion to an Epic story!!!,"(Spoiler Alert for those who have not read books 1 and 2)Things are looking grim for the land of Alleble. Paragor, the Betrayer, has unleashed ancient monsters to help him take over the Realm. The Wyrm Lord, the greatest of all Dragons, and the Seven Sleepers, the greatest of all Wolves, have been unleashed. Antoinette Reed is locked in a tower in Paragor's stronghold, forced to watch all these horrors be unleashed upon the land.Meanwhile on earth Aiden Thomas's best friend Robby has fallen into the service of Paragor himself. Time is running out for Aiden to save him, but with Robby's father around, can he?This is an amazing conclusion to one of the best fantasy series you will ever read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone over 9 who loves action, adventure, and a great tale of Good vs Evil!!My hat is off to you, Mr Batson, for creating such a wonderful tale!!!"
5,The final storm,The Final Storm by Wayne Thomas Batson is the final book in the Door Within trilogy. This book answers the most asked question... will Paragor win?This gripping novel will not dissapoint!
5,Best series my son has read,My 10 year old read this whole series in 2 weeks and loved it. It is hard to find books he likes long enough to hold his attention. This was not a disappointment.
5,Incredible final book; a must read!,"Definitely a thrilling closer. Still as safe but thrilling fantasy as the other two. WARNING! Do not read this book out of order in the series! But then, do not skip out on it! Personally, it is the best book in this series, and is fascinating for all ages."
4,Good Book but Gaps Remain,"Overall, a good book covering the life of a pastor that has helped millions. Starts off a little slow for my taste, covering, in detail, his family history. After those early chapters, the book picks up.While I understand there can be only so much covered in one book, I am still wondering why he chose not to discuss his educational background in a little more detail. He admits he earned Bachelors' degrees, but as you continue reading suddenly he starts calling himself ""Doctor Schuller"". Where did this come from? Wait ....I know...he dosen't have an earned degree, only an honorary doctorate. Funny how he dosen't mention that. In fact, I lost count of how many times he referred to himself as ""Dr. Schuller"". I was a bit much. I think he likes seeing his name in print. I have an earned doctorate and rarely use the title because position dosen't make you a good leader.Other than that, I have no complaints regarding the content and I recommended it fully."
3,Galbraith on money,His style is both good and bad news. It is delightfully irreverent. But I think he concentrates more on that style than covering some of the basics as billed in the book description. He frequently uses terms that he has not adequately explained.
4,Windows 2000 MCSE Exam 70-210 Book Review,"I recently bought this book because I am starting to study for my MCSE and I was very suprised. This book is very well written, it has easy to follow lessons, and explains step by step how to set up the operating system. I would definetly recommend this book."
2,Too Many Technical Errors!,"The book is written well, but I've found there to be too many technical errors in it. On page 79 it refers to a command as makedisk.exe instead of makeboot.exe, for one example. I've found myself spending so much time researching the mistakes, that I feel I would have been better off just studying some other book. If you get it just be certain that you don't use it as your only reference, as I've found an average of 1 error every 10-15 pages."
2,"Oh, Really?","The book was purchased based upon high ratings. My impression of the product is that little effort was made to insure accuracy. The book comes with a CD containing 200+ exam questions that barely relate to the book’s content and often the answers contradict the book. The New Riders Web site contains an errata file containing 6 pages of reported errors and few of the errors I found were listed. If you buy this book, play to spend time cross referencing everything."
4,Through the eyes of Children,"What a world this could be if we spoke our truth as we see it with our child hearts. The clearity of this childs responses caused me to laugh with one sentence and cry with the next. The mixed responses were at the way humans live their ""serious"" lives with all of their rules and conclusions, clouding their reality with it's true simplisity. This book carries you close to the realization that life looked at, from this young childs view point, could bring one to the level of ""The Joy of Happiness""."
3,Good Read,"After the Falls was an nice experience for me. The author is likeable and fun, and her story is one that will resonate with a lot of readers. I might suggest reading Too Close to the Falls. It might be easier to get into this book if you already ""know"" the author. All in all, this is an interesting memoir that is sure to entertain."
5,Wonderful!,"I had a hard time putting this book down, particulary being a memoir / biography I was surprised at that. This was such a fun precious read, I just loved it!!"
5,Life affirming for those who are a little different...,"This magical book came into my hands from two separate sources (in the same week--go figure) and has been shared with others since. One friend claims it completely changed her life and promptly went out, bought another 3 copies and passed them along to her friends. If you've ever felt that somehow you were an odd kid, this charming and insightful book is a great way to see challenges strengthen and enhance a woman's character, probably much like it did yours. I want a sequel."
3,not factal,"I grew up in Lewiston and my parents were mentioned in the book several times. My mother, Betty Helms, was referred to as the mayor of Lewiston... my mother was NEVER the mayor! My father who also was mentioned never would order a ""Black Russsian"" in his entire life at any bar (he wouldn't know what it was.. he only drank beer) interesting book, but not factual more fiction and as much as my parents would have loved being mentioned, I believe that like others from this wonderful village would have preferred the author to check her facts before writing the book.Deborah (Helms) Bates"
3,Not Hardback,"I ordered hardback and was sent soft back. Very disappointing. This is the second time this has happened to me except this time I did not ask for an exchange. I will be a lot more wary about ordering again, though. Other than that, the book was in excellent condition."
3,Hard to Believe,"This book is easy to read, but difficult to believe. I grew up during the same time as the author, and some of the things she writes about are far-fetched to have actually happened. That being said, it is entertaining."
5,Too close to the falls,I found this book easy to read and related to the places that she wrote about. I also grew up in the Falls so it held my attention. I'm not usually a book reader but this book has sparked an interest to read.
4,Best substitute we've found.,"We tried several different kinds of gluten free crackers and for something similar to a saltine, this was our favorite choice. The kids really liked them for cheese and crackers and to crumble in chili and soups. The only problem we had with them is that most arrive broken. I usually seperate the crumbled ones and save them in a ziploc for soups."
3,They are o.k.,"I bought them for my husband, who decided to go on ""no wheat diet"". He eats them, because he has nothing else to snack on. I tried them, they do have a little of typical crackery taste."
4,"Great Music, Great Show and Lots of Fun",This is an excellent video for those who appreciate great music and like to have fun while listening great music. I enjoyed a lot this concert and I am really surprised (and disappointed as well) that there is no DVD version available so far.
4,Its alright,Its ok but the larger one is far superior. I got this as a gift for a friend. Good for a stocking stuffer or for a small gift.
3,Reception was variable,"For older cars and for the original iPod shuffle, this is a neat little option to play your songs over your car radio. Also cool that it plugs into the cigarette lighter. It has a funny shape, my wife calls it the iBong.When the reception is good then the sound quality is pretty good and it gets the job done. But even with the best reception, the unit has never produced real high quality sound comparable to the built-in CD player.We've found reception to be quite variable in Los Angeles and San Francisco and you end up going through long stretches of harsh static coming over yours speakers which gets old really fast. Also, the transponder requires that you manually find a frequency on your FM radio that is in between normal radio stations. This can be pretty tedious. A more slick solution would be if the Transpod could actually hunt for these frequencies automatically, display the frequency for you, and you just dial your radio to the suggested number."
1,Strike to your OUT,Well this was my second DLO Transpod. The first one was DOA on delivery. The second one worked somewhat. I found it had a lot of hissing static. I tried all different ranges of stations high and low and was not happy with the sound. It is to expensive to just use as a car charging unit. It just didn't seem compatible with my Alpine receiver. Amazon was great refunding my money for both.
5,Best Fashion Book I Own,"I am a fashion student at Parsons, and this book is the exact equivilant of two years of training. My drawings improved beyond belief even after just a few days of studying this bible. The drawings are informative and have a style and flair that only the best illustrators posess. Impressive -- A must have for any fashion student!!"
1,Fashion Illustration for Designers,"I have been teaching Fashion Illustration for quite some time and I think I can deliver a qualified opinion on the subject. 9 Heads is the poorest and the most unprofessionally illustrated Fashion Drawing treatise available. No wonder it's highly despised, both at FIT and Parsons. The drawings excel in vulgarity and amateurishness, resembling those done by cartoon-fed teenagers. The fact that it still sells is due only to the complete lack of criteria in today's average customer.Stick with Abling or Stipelman."
1,"If this is the best book out there,","drawing skills must truly be at an all-time low. I bought this book because of Amazon's 5-star rating, but I found the drawing style distinctly unsophisticated and melodramatically adolescent. The figures look like comic book characters, and the flats look, at best, ready to photocopy. Do yourself a favor and attend proper figure drawing and anatomy classes for instruction in the human form, then learn to draw fabrics, draping, shoes, and buttons from old-fashioned, time-tested observation and practice, practice, practice."
5,Traditional Music from Vietnam,If you have a hankering for some music to transport you to Vietnam then this cd is for you. The music is classic old style Vietnamese music. Great for relaxation.
3,Better Organization,"There is valuable instruction in this video; HOWEVER, there needs to be more time on the movements and less time on footage of tinkling streams, mountain vistas, forests, etc. The camera work is bad in one respect: I will be following Ms. Davis's movements and instructions; then the camera pans to one of the other participants in the video who are at a different point in the sequence of the movement... Confusing! All instructions should come ""before"" the movements begin, not an additional tag-on when the movements are finished. It is impossible to do an entire series of a movement without stopping the vcr because in some movements she will do six repetitions and in others, only one and then move on. With better organization of the movement sequences this could be a really great video. Just give me something that I can follow along with, completely, start to finish."
5,Spectacular Video,"I felt this video was fantastic and helped me change my life! I enjoy the video because the instruction is clear, to the point, and easy to follow. I have had little background in this area, and need all the help I can get. This video provides wonderful basic instruction, but would also be useful, I think, for someone with more experience than I have. In addition, the scenery and the setting are beautiful, making the video a pleasure to watch as well as to learn from. The setting is especially helpful because it graphically displays the five elements for healing that she teaches in the video. The exercises taught in the video have helped me to control my allergies and they give me more energy and a feeling of peace and relaxation. I have recommended it to many of my friends."
5,Absolutely beautiful,"The best money I've spent in a long time. This video is awesome. First of all, it's beautiful. The outdoor setting is wonderful to look at and the shots and camera angles do a good job of letting you see what to do without being jerky or intrusive. The natural setting really lends a peaceful feeling to the whole video. Definitely better than another video I had once, which was shot in a studio.The woman in the video does a fantastic job of explaining how to do it, and her voice is very soothing to listen to. I was able to do every move she showed. Maybe not as gracefully as she did them, but I only got the video last week and I'm not exactly Miss Coordination :-)Also, this may not matter to everyone, but I liked that not only is the instructor female, but so are most of the other people in this video.All in all, I'm very happy with this video and am already recommending it to friends."
5,Great for over 60!,"I bought this for my mother who is 67 years old and has developed foot problems as the result of using the treadmill (and old age). She has practiced with this DVD for 3 months and there has been great changes! Her face is toned, her complexion is rosy and bright, her lungs feel expanded and strong, her digestion has improved, and she just look great overall! Although her feet will hurt after she has been moving about during the day, the exercises on this DVD will help stretch the feet muscle and heal them for the next day. She goes to church every Sunday, and the women at church have noticed the changes in her. I've ordered two more for her friends."
5,The Spirit of Qi Gong,"I found this video so helpful. I started with very little knowledge. Deborah Davis, takes you gently and easily through each motion and movement and though it requires constant practice I felt empowered with the information and direction she gave"
3,Too fast for me!,"This got lovely reviews and I want to learn Qi Gong. I thought because Deborah included info for women of different ages, it would be right for me however, I am 72 years old and have had two joint replacements. This makes it impossible for me to do being that my range of motion is not adequate to the exercises in this book/video combo and the movements are much too fast. I think I need something slowly done and meditative.Thank you."
5,autoranging meter,"I was looking for an auto ranging multimeter and I believe this one is it. Pluses of this meter: large easy to read display, backlight, autoranging, within .01% accuracy on DC and AC readings, Frequency is within 1/2 hz, test leads are nice, included batteries, feels sturdy, fused with a standard size, includes plug-in test adapter for transistors and diodes, incredible value for the price.Cons: Have to take two screws out to change the AAA batteries, box did not have correct picture on it, no spare fuse or hole to put one,"
3,Good Value,"Pros: accurate, large backlit LCD, and quality probes.Cons: annoying crackling/scratchy speaker. Protective hard cover feels cheap.Other thoughts: I emailed Sinometer about the scratchy sound from the speaker, but never received a response."
4,Good unit,"I am replacing my old Fluke unit so I notice the difference in build, but for my purposes this is a good meter. It might be a little large and clunky for some, but having a large display that will back light if needed is what I wanted."
5,Good quality for the money,"I've only had it for about a month, but so far I'm satisfied. The quality seems good for the money. I wish it came with alligator clip leads as well as the standard leads, but I think that's the way most meters are. I'm having a hard time finding appropriate alligator clip leads at a reasonable price."
1,got defective unit,"The display of the multimeter I received did not show anything. Some of the buttons made sounds, so there was some ""life"" in the unit.In addition, two of the three included AAA batteries were dead. They looked deformed(!) and gave low voltages on a battery tester.Since there were two issues, I got an Extech EX330 instead, which works fine.PS: since this review is getting a low ""helpful"" percentage, I want to explain why I would have found it helpful. (I had been contemplating whether to write it before I did.) First, the two issues indicate quite poor final quality control. This may have no bearing on reliability or lifetime of working units, but it made me concerned. Second, I find it a hassle to return defective products, so a warning seemed in order to offset the many positive reviews. Finally, while one star is clearly harsh for the *product*, I could talk only about the *unit* I got."
1,The Proverbial Lemon,"This meter currently resides in a waste-basket. It did operate, but sporadically. The cable contacts were unreliable. The Range button played dumb. I advise purchasing another brand. Amazon's pricing obviates the aggravation of pursuing repair/replacement. I believe I hit a lemon, but be aware you're taking a chance with this one."
5,Better than I thought it would be for a sub $40 meter,"I'm always skeptical about buying something like this online where I have no way of trying it or no one who can tell me their experiences.The reviews were good so for less than $40 I figured I would buy it and go from there.This meter is solid and has a nice, clear display; the back light is awesome. It's a little large but that's OK. The auto-ranging scales are clear and easily understood. It does not have a low enough scale for micro-amps but I knew that before I purchased it and didn't expect to find any meter for this price that would read around 10 micro-amps.In conclusion; if you need a home or general work meter with a decent range that is rugged, the MS8268 fits the bill very well. The only advise I would give is to get yourself a padded case for some protection while not in use, don't just throw it in the bottom of your toolbox, no meter will last very long if you do that."
4,Not bad,"Good price and fast shipping but it's a little big which is not a deal breaker, i only use it maybe once a week and it works great."
5,Good size,"This meter works great. It has a really good feel and look. It's easy to grip, and easy to read the display. I would buy another one. It's just as good as other $100 and up meters I have purchased in the past."
4,Perfect for the money,"Product is accurate and good for occasional use. A little too bulky, but has nice features such as the back light and hold button. I wish it is less bulky than it is though, or I would have given it 5 stars."
3,banana plugs,"basic tests seem ok, my comment has to do with advertising.the elenco plugs advertised alongside as a common addition do not fit the input jacks on the sinometer. So I wasted a litle money. First time I'd ever fault Amazon for deceptive advertising. I've come to expect a higher quality experience from them. Caveat emptor. Will not assume that things advertised together actually work together in the future."
1,Defective on receipt,"While it looked like a pretty solid meter with some good design features, the bottom half of the screen failed to work out of the box. As discussed in other reviews, quality control/dependability appear to be an issue."
3,decent price,"good price but this one has a little problem. something it cannot be turn on once u turn off, unless u reopen the battery cover and disconnect the battery and reconnect it."
1,Doesn't do the job,"While the meter seems to be well built (though seems larger than it needs to be - difficult to hold in one hand comfortably), its accuracy is way off. At receipt, I quickly tested it for AC and DC voltage accuracy. Too bad, its off by over 20%. For both AC and DC. Didn't bother to test other capabilities - returned it immediately."
5,Excellent value for a modest price. MS8268,"I purchased this multimeter to replace a 20+ year old Radio Shack multimeter that had finally died. I needed a fairly accurate, voltage, current and resistance measuring device. This meter does all of that plus a lot more.It came with a little adapter to enable component leads to be inserted for measuring transistor HFE, (current gain) or the capacitance on leaded capacitors. Also, it has limited frequency measurement and diode test capabilities. Most will never need these features, for a hobbyist, they could be very useful.The MS8268 reminds me of the Fluke meters that I have used through the years. I am not ashamed, at all, to be pulling this out of my kit in front of a customer. This meter will be in my car (travel) tool kit along with my other 'must have' tools.Would I recommend this to my friends? Heck ya!As a response to some of the reviews I have read, mine came with 3AAA batteries and user manual.Ken"
1,Not recommended - sorry I bought it.,"I have used it only a few times but this multimeter was a waste of money. Sometimes it works, and other times it acts like it works but the reading will be off the chart. It is extremely undependable, so I do not recommend it."
5,Expand your beliefs of who you think you are.,"The chapter on ""defining"" and ""expanding"" beliefs is worth the price of admission. So many people I work with as a coach have such definite beliefs about who they are, how they need to do things, and whether they can or can't accomplish something. Fortgang shows us how to move through those limiting mindsets and create new, more expansive thinking that is filled with hope and possibility. The simple act of changing one entrenched belief about something can, and will, create incredible break-through results."
5,An Extraordinary Guide to Personal Empowerment,"If you are looking to take your life or your business to the next level, Laura Berman Fortgang clearly shows you how to create your own roadmap to get there. This extraodinary guide provides a process for tapping into your own wisdom using empowering ""Wisdom Access Questions."" My personal favorites are: ""How have people used you?"" and ""Who have you been for them?"" -- questions that help determine who we are and what we are built for.Strategies, tools and techniques for creating success (in your own terms) and living a life that is passionate and purposeful, are also provided in this brilliant book. Laura is truly a guru in the world of coaching, and she shares her considerable wisdom and coaching experience in this wonderful book."
2,Overpriced,"For twelve bucks you get one adapter and a bolt. Rockler dot com (which I think bought Bench Dog) has a ""Miter Slot Hardware Kit"" with two adapters, each with a bolt *and* a knob, and costs $7. They are perhaps not the same material, but appear to have the same purpose, and cost less than a third of the price."
4,Not for the Craftsman,"I bought this for the Craftsman 10"" Tablesaw (Sears item# 00921805000).It does not work with it, though it is a solid piece and looks like it would do the job for other table saws that are wide enough to accept it."
4,Bench Dog Miter Slot Adapter,"I bought this Bench Dog miter slot adapter to use with my Milescraft 1407 dual feather board, since the 3/4"" X 3/8"" miter slot adapters that come with it are so sinfully cheap. This Bench Dog miter bar is made of a similar cast material, but it is thicker and more solid, not brittle and wafer thin like the Milescraft bars are. I think it may be a little expensive for what it actually is, but it's probably a lot less likely that you will need to replace it due to wear or breakage."
5,A fix,Bought the featherboards seperately thinking that they came with the slot inserts. These slot adapters fit perfectly into the featherboards and I now have 2 functional units.
3,"It'll do, but when will Sony release a COMPLETE compilation?","Yet another compilation from this seminal Irish folk band's extensive catalogue of 1950s and '60s recordings (almost none have been released on disc), this touches on some lesser known songs that still stand up with the group's best work. But Wrap The Green Flag does nothing for fans who want the entire catalogue on CD, or at least a two-disc compilation."
3,Great!,"This is a great CD for someone looking to introduce themselves to Irish Music. However, for the more hardcore Clancy and Makem fans, this disc offers little in the way of new material. There are a few rare versions of songs that you can't get anywhere else, but most have been released on other CD's or record albums. Be aware that the song ""Valley of Knockanure"" came from the album ""The Irish Uprising"", not from an unreleased Carnegie Hall performance. I wish that Columbia would just rerelease some of the classic WHOLE albums on CD, instead of waisting our time on repackaged items. Overall, a good buy, but don't expect anything new."
5,Wonderful Book of Adveture,I have read other books by this Author and have enjoyed them all. They are written in an easy style and he creates characters that you can enjoy knowing. Also a great value.
5,MCC & Country music stars cannot reproduce music like this.,"Yes, I bought the CD a long time ago (10 years).But, I was shuffling thru. my songs in the ipod, I relaized what an amazing CD this was. I will say that I was just starting to listen to country at that time. And that ""Come on Come on"" is one of the earliest intros. to country. Now, I can say that I have heard plenty of of new country, and not many artist matched the quality of selected songs in terms of music, vocals, writing. This CD has proven to be a good benchmark. IMO if you can pick a CD that you have listened to a while ago, and are still able to listen to, then that is great CD.My favorite songs on CD:Not too much to ask - Duet with Joe Diffie.Passoinate Kisses, He thinks he'll keep her, I feel lucky, The bug, The hard way."
5,Great collection,"Some great ""howl along"" songs in this collection. Love her voice, love her sense of humor in some of these songs. ""Sometimes you're the bug, sometimes you're the windshield..."" How true how true!"
5,Chapin's passion shines through her music!,"This is one of those rare CDs that I can put in and listen to beginning to end. It is a bit more traditional country than is played on the radio today, which is not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination.It kicks off with ""The Hard Way"" and goes right into the women's anthem ""He Thinks He'll Keep Her"", about the guy who takes his woman for granted (as many guys do). ""I Feel Lucky"" was a big hit on the radio. ""The Bug"" is an upbeat, fun romp, as is ""Passionate Kisses"". ""I Take My Chances"" and ""Come On Come On"" end the disc on a great note. Chapin is a talented writer and performer and I know she will be around for awhile!"
3,Not Her Best,"This may be her most popular cd, but it is not her best. Her talent is expressed so much better in earlier and later work, I would recommend anything over this."
3,Over Rated,"MCC has many much better albums than this one. If you really want to experience MCC at her best, I recommend Shooting Straight In The Dark, State of the Heart and Stones in the Road before this one. Come On Come On is ok but very over rated with many mediocre songs and some good ones."
5,Mary's songs are just like her beautiful looks so wonderful.,"I LOVE YOU, Mary-Chapin Carpenter. You are so beautiful so are your songs."
4,"Fine singing, fine playing, excellent grown up songs","MCC combines intelligence, integrity and insight with an assured voice and a fine choice of material. This lady has it all and you can hear most of it on ""Come on come on"".I put a bunch of female singers together on a CD for the car and every time I play it, the songs from ""Come On"" stand out for their sheer quality, including production.The album covers a range of mood and pace, from the punchy and highly enjoyable ""Passionate Kisses"" through the defiant attitude of ""I feel lucky"" and ""I take my chances"" to the reflectiveness of ""Rhythm of the Blues"" and ""Come on, come on"". The highlight of the album for me is ""I am a town"", with sparse guitar and cello. The mood she creates is wistful and tender and the images provide a new take on the classic American road song.Alongside the gems, some of the more lightweight songs such as ""The Bug"" are fun but skippable. Hence my hard-assed 4 rather than 5 stars. But make no mistake, it's an excellent album."
2,Not bad but...,"On the whole this is an okay book. In some places I did indeed feel like a dummy, that is I couldn't follow it. In other places it was so obvious I felt like a very smart person who was bored. It has some good info in it if you're willing to look for it. Maybe consider this book if you are just starting out on this topic and know very little."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"This is a very, very beginner's book for someone who has just had her first hot flash. It is a great guide if you are just starting the perimenopausal stage and want to know what to expect but for someone in the middle of the process, not quite as helpful."
5,Must the Problem ALWAYS Start With MEN ...?,"In this case, NO! It wasn't a MAN thing-It was a WOmen thing. My friend's wife of 18 years left him, blaming it on menopause. He wanted to be sympathetic, understanding, and of course, KNOWLEDGEABLE about his wife's condition. Although it didn't save their marriage (because she really wanted to travel around Europe and use the poor man for his money,) it DID increase his knowledge. He gave her the book to increase HER understanding about the way she felt, and how to counteract it; BUT she read the book on the airplane enroute BACK to the U.K. All in all, the book did its job; it was clear, concise, and easy to follow. However,there should be a disclaimer on it saying: ""It can't save your marriage."" Buy the book and see for yourself what a good ""guide"" it was. I recommend buying it from Amazon! PS Can anyone recommend a good divorce lawyer in the Pocono, PA area? He DESERVES to get MORE THAN HALF!!"
2,They can do better than this,"I loved Tupac and the Outlawz were dope on Tupac's records. But I have to say this CD wasn't all that. I only liked four songs out of the 17 tracks, ""This is the Life"", ""Ya'll Cant Do"", ""Boxspring Boogie"" and ""Loyalty"". As you will tell when you listen, these are the better uptempo fire tracks. Most of the others are slow tracks and try to talk about social issues, but the Outlawz just dont pull that off like Tupac could, which is what the Lawz are trying to do. But I can only feel them when they do tracks that are uptempo, loud and angry. The Lawz are at their BEST when they are coming with HEAT. Leave the slow stuff to someone else to do. When they come aggressive they sound like how Tupac wanted them to, like Thug Life West Side Outlaw Riders!!"
5,TIGHT,"I always loved 2pac,and have all cd's,so obviously i knew about outlawz,they were tight,and i loved them on hit em up,but i really never thogut they could make it wathout Pac,but i had a extra 15 bucks,and decided to give them a chance,and i loved it,every song buy Boxspring Boogie was tight,i loved ""our life"" and ""second hand smoke"",they miss pac,and it shows in what they say,they are a lot deeper than people like Jay-z and Cash Money and stuff like that,so if you just like something to dance too,don't get this,but if you like some deep stuff,pick it up.PEACE"
5,"If you have MVP, you must get this book!",This book is fantastic--the best book yet on MVP. There is a ton of useful information--I really liked the chapter about others with MVP and what they had to say. I started doing with Dr. Scordo recommended--can't believe I'm starting to feel better already. This book really gives you the confidence you need to take control of this syndrome. You will not be sorry you spent the money--the book is worth its weight in gold.I've read them all--this is by far the best book on MVP.
5,"Response to: Disappointed in outdated information & lack of author creden, September 3, 2002","I would like to correct some misinformation in the review posted by Louis in Alabama. The author has a PhD in Nursing, Cardiac Physiology, not an ""unrelated field."""
1,Warning - Most of these reviews are fake!,"Notice how the same 3 or 4 people keep writing 5 star reviews for this book? Some friends of ""Doctor"" Scordo perhaps? You should know that Dr. Scordo is not even a medical doctor. Save some money and try this book instead: Natural Therapies for Mitral Valve Prolapse by Ronald L. Hoffman.Shame on you, Dr. Scordo!"
1,Disappointed in outdated information & lack of author creden,"I bought this book in hopes that I would find detailed information on my illness and possible treatment. Then I learned the author was not a medical doctor (cardiologist, etc.) but a PHD in an unrelated field. This book may help a small percentage of people, but it completely ignores a number of well-tested treatments because of the bias toward natural and psychological approaches. This book will be old news to those who have done even superficial research into the central nervous system/dysautonomia disorder that is MVPS."
4,Great kids songs,"As a kid, I loved this album and some of the first I ever sang in front of people were ""Bye Bye Dodo"" and ""The Ghost of Bleak House."" Brings some of us back to our days as young children."
5,Terrific music and poetry for kids or adults.,Tom Chapin is a tremendous musician and song writer whose poetry teaches good lessons while providing lots of entertainment. The title song of this album is one of the finest for adult or child. We love to travel and listen and sing along to the 6 Tom Chapin tapes we have -- so far!!
4,BONUS Material Are Missing ?,"It List the radio session ""You Move Me "" ""Alone "" ""Let Me Go""on CD back cover.But it not in The CD ??? What going on KOCH Records NY. I am going to buy new CD CD from UK which is a bitmore but they had U Move Me (Video) and all Bonus tracks."
3,Not as moved as I had hoped.,"Don't get me wrong, I like this CD. But I feel it's lacking what his other solo work has. There isn't one track which stands out over the rest on this disc... they all seem to blend together. I was excited when I found he had released a new disc... but found myself slightly NOT MOVED once I reached the end of the last track. His new material speaks about being alone and not feeling loved. It reflects on a drinking problem which leads me to believe this could be the reason he is now alone and doesn't feel loved.This CD is OK - but not great. If you are a fan, you will enjoy it but be left feeling as if you want him to snap out of this mood he is in and get back to what made you a fan in the first place."
5,smells great,I love this product it was worth the price and for what i use it for it lasted a long time.
1,"Does not have Zipper, Velcro, or Drawstring.","This is a little better than a plastic trash bag. If you hold it up to the light you can see the small holes at the seams where water can get through, and it did get through. Don’t buy... its complete junk."
3,Great pictures - near zero critical analysis,"Very one-sided book on the topic. Accepts a lot of evidence that is far from being scientifically verified. But, due to its great collection of photos, it's a good addition to one's Bigfoot library."
5,The mother of all bigfoot books!,"A well written and nicely packaged presentation of North America's most mysterious beast. Great illustrations and well structured, making it easy to read and follow. Now only if the naysayers would give it a read, it might have them scratching their heads on how to debunk some of the convincing evidence presented.Great job!"
4,Great Buy,I bought this computer for my 11 year old granddaughter for Christmas. It arrived in a timely fashion and it was like new. There were no scratches or dents or anything. It was absolutely fantastic. It worked very well and I was even tempted to keep it for myself. My granddaughter does her schoolwork on this computer and she says it is great.
1,I feel misled.,"$5.95 for less that two pages of marginally useless information about an intervention that had no clinical effect? Buyer beware. Selling this ""brief article"" at this price seems unethical to me."
1,killed my shrimp,i added this to my tank and the next day my pepermint shrimp was dead pretty sure this killed it
4,Pretty Cool,they seem to work good and feel nice. i just wish they fit into smaller spaces. i can only use them between a few different teeth. I see on the recent packaging they will be coming out w/ 'tight' & 'moderate' and 'large' which is better so customers can choose which one(s) they need...
1,VERY POOR,BAD SOUND WITH POOR INTERPRETATION QUALITY. SOME VERY BRILLANT EXAMPLES OF LATIN AMERICA BAROQUE IN RUINS. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TITLE TO ANYBODY.
5,nostalga,If you enjoy Johhny Mathis you will I am sure find this collection of Johnny's personal selction a treat to your ears.I was a teenager in high school during the late 50's when Johnny made what I believe to be some of his very best songs.This collection is so masterfully reproduced that the quality is phenomenal. So much better on CD's than the LP vinyls that we had back then. And of course the stereo systems that we have now further enhance the listening experience. Unfortunately Johnny's voice is now no longer anywhere near what it was back then so I am so pleased that we have these great songs archived on this new media.I just can't get enough of this great and wonderful voice. I'm just worried that I might wear out my stereo from playing these albums over and over again.
4,Products Fine - Delivery Awful,"Although the products I ordered in December were just fine, the DHL delivery via llama was unbelievably slow and subsequently not received at all in time for Christmas. Amazon did reship, taking their own time about it, but at least used another carrier. Compared to everything else I ordered online at the same time, all free shipping by the way, this was absolutely the worst!"
2,BEWARE -- Omits Many Hits!,"I was appalled to find out that, despite including 86 songs in this 4-disc collection, it excludes more than 30 of Mathis' charted hits, including dozens that made the Top 40.Given that he only had 19 Top 40 hits (plus another 33 that made the Top 100), it's appalling that a career-spanning collection like this could leave so much out. To me, for a collection like this, you start with all the A-side hit singles, then add some interesting album tracks, some favorites by the artist, and then sprinkle in some rarities and live performances. And preferably remix the stuff for stereo, when formerly only mono tracks have been released, and the master tapes are available. But to omit nearly 3 dozen charted singles (many of them Top 40 hits) is unforgiveable.You gotta wonder who's running the show at Legacy to screw something up like this."
1,"Johnny and I, Together Again","Two yesrs ago, thanks to a Black Mold Catastrophe, I lost just about everything in my cabin. That included tapes and CD's of Johnny Mathis that I had treasured for years. When, finally, I began to miss them so much that my ears ached, I decided to replace as much as I could on a limited budget. So I ordered the Personal Collection, mainly because one disk had ""99 Miles From LA"" on it, my personal favorite. Since the collection arrived, I have been swimming in a glorious sea of nostalga and loving every cut on the four disks. At last, Johnny and I can sing together again while I wash dishes! This is a great collection; it gives me an ear-gasm every time I listen to it."
1,not received,I haven`t received the CD's. I would like to know what happened since I made the order one month ago. thanks
5,Good songs,I hear Sheryl Crow songs for many years. She is an excellent musical performer. She plays fluently guitars and has a lovely voice. This dvd is perfectly for any age of people.
2,"Not the best blu-ray live show, fake audience ..no prensence and dull","I really like Sheryl Crow songs but this blu-ray is missing many things that a great concert dvd should have:The main artist doesn't seem to have fun at first when she comes to the stage..No real audience or fan, instead some ''paid'' people to half fill a room to act and dance like morons..Camera never catch the audience or show the back of the room...empty roomNo emotions..not a single great moment...just a ''Recorging''sound quality is okPicture is ok.So that's not a great DVD, if someone knows a REAL dvd or Sheryl crow on show please leave me a message.Thanks"
1,Not a translation of the original,"I wanted a book that would provide decent, close translations of the original French, since there are too few of these out there with respect to Verlaine. As a poet, I recognize the difficulty in translating poetry, but even so, and with an incredibly limited knowledge of French, it's clear that these translations are not at all accurate, but mostly just based on the whimsical wishes of the translator, who seems to have intentionally disregarded many straightforward French words and phrases that could have easily be put into English, without damaging the poem as a whole.I felt scammed, and would return this if it weren't for my laziness. I never expected to complain about poetry translations because the process really is an art form and one that is very difficult, but this is simply too much.Go to A. S. Kline's FREE Poetry Archive instead."
2,"Great Poet, Less Than Great Translator.","The downside to translation is that we always loose, in some amount, something of what the author(poet)is expressing. The translator did not try to maintain Velaine's essence...he tried to create a whole new poem from what he understood Verlaine is expressing."
5,Shapiro is the best!,"The reader below from Puero Rico could simply not be more wrong--no less a poet than Seamus Heaney has praised quite highly the work of Norman Shapiro, who is universally recognized as one of our premiere translators of French literature, easily on a level with Richard Howard and Richard Wilbur and W.S. Merwin. Mr. Shapiro has won a National Book Award for his work, and his four volumes (thus far) of La Fontaine are superb, dazzling!So, ignore the ill-informed reviewer below and proceed with confidence! And check out ""Fifty Fables,"" ""Fifty More Fables,"" ""Once Again, La Fontaine,"" and ""La Fontaine's Bawdy""--all translated by Shapiro--a heroic endeavor, and as good as French literature gets in English!!!"
1,Very disappointing!,I am not one to drop a lot of money on jewelry but I do buy what I like. This pendant was just plain cheap and not worth $5 let alone $25. A shoelace would be nicer than the cord which came with it as well. This is definitely NOT one of my better purchases.
5,if i were----,if i were a serial killer antihuman would be my anthem---- i do not care what anyone says this is their best release--- especially if you are insane------ it is very nice that they are off that poser record label---- earache---- ...-------- but anyhow everyone must have a copy-------------------- NOW-------------------------------
5,Godflesh is the definition,GF as returned to their streetcleaner roots.Justin is a Fricken genius.lee
5,"""What an ending to a new beginning""","What a final exit for Godflesh. The album speaks volumes in the sense that it has a sound closer to streetcleaner, not as dark but still robust and heavy. It is a pleasure to listen to. I do enjoy such albums as ""pure"" and ""Messiah"", but the album Hymns once again falls back to the sounds of there first album. I enjoy Godflesh and wish them much sucess with ""Jesu""! They have what it takes too make quality music album after album without leaving you disappointed."
1,Lousy company,I bought a product like this one from this company before and it did not work right. When I tried to get them via email they told me to change the barttery. I did this and it worked twice (like before). They would not get back to me after that via email when I requested they take it back. I will not buy from this company after their indifference towards the quality of their products.
4,My third copy of the book...,I read each individual dated page of this book every morning. I've already been through 2 books before ordering my newest copy...
3,Little emotion. Stripped down.,"On ""Gravity"" Monolake exhibits minimalism to an extreme. With exception of a few tracks which are good, the album as a whole has a cold and stripped down feeling. The last track in particular has no beat at all, nine minutes of fuzz, and is reminiscent of Future Sound of London's early work (althogh FSOL did a much better job).On the plus side, some tracks on ""Gravity"" are good enough that the listener forgets that 6-8 minutes have passed. Tracks like ""Ice,"" ""Frost,"" and ""Static"" are still somewhat dark, but have more emotion and energy. Although it does have some brilliant moments, one might do better trying Richie Hawtin's work, specifically ""DE9: Close to the Edit."""
4,Good readable overview of fascinating person,"Bought this book after seeing the TV Cleopatra mini-series. Well written, it moves along nicely without heavy academic footnoting et al that can turn a good read boring.Almost as fascinating is the rather peculiar debate over Cleopatra's race in the reviews here. One writer erroneously observes that no historical writers ever write who her mother was. Well, actually, most writers have identified her mother as another in the Ptolemy family (intermarriage was the rule rather than the exceptoin among Ptolemy dynasty). The only real question is the identity of her grandmother. And even there the preponderous of evidence is that she was probably Macedonian or Jewish. There are no contemporary descriptions of her as ""black"" or even dark. Try reading history that does not have a PC ax to grind and you will learn much though it may hinder the silly PC ranting and raving.Anyway, a good informative read here."
4,A historian trying to clear the air,"I just wanted to say that no matter how much people try to create a ""revisionist history"", you cannot change pure and simple facts. Cleopatra WAS NOT African. I'm sorry to those of you who believe she was, but she wasn't. Like others have said before, she was GREEK. No one is trying to say that many Egyptians weren't black (they were in fact a range of colors), but the Ptolemies were Greek, not Egyptian. The Ptolemies were left over from Alexander's empire and had ruled Egypt since his death. While they adopted many Egyptian customs, they were in thought and deed, Greek. Personally, I don't think it matters what she looked like, the important thing is what she managed to accomplish for so young a queen, especially in the period in which she lived. I would also venture to say that Caesar and Antony loved her for her unique personality, not only for her beauty."
3,Cleopatra,"I think that some of the reviews have missed the point for this book. The real controversy is not Cleopatra's ethnicity, because we have documentation on this that dates to her era. She was a Ptolemy; therefore of Macedonian descent. Study your ancient history and put forth a little effort into some research. From most accounts that I have read, all point to her being extremely proud of that Macedonian heritage. You in the 21st century, believe that you know more about this historical figure, than the writers of the first century. In this, you must agree with me that the information we have now, is inaccurate compared to the relatively recent information that they had. You cannot rewrite history."
2,I did not enjoy the book.,"I hate to dissapoint you Memphis but, why is it that authors that write about cleopatra seem to blatantly omit who her mother was? I know that her father could not have had her by himself, could it have been a women of color? Next time do your research I suggest you start with the library in Cairo!"
1,A Pale Cleopatra?,"Why is it so hard for people to believe that Cleopatra had dark skin? She has black features but is always portrayed as lily white. If a black woman was represented as a European queen everyone would complain and cause an uproar! I'm sick and tired of these fake white Cleopatras. She was dark, Get over it!"
3,cleopatra white?,"Cleopatra was,in fact, a woman of color. Why is that so hard to believe? I really think it's sad that, in the 21st century, this historical fact continues to create such controversy. To those who find this fact so unacceptable,maybe you need to examine your reasons. People of color contributed to civilization also. In fact, the first man discovered was of African descent."
5,Fun with Micky,"My 2 year old son adores this show and we now listen to the CD every day on the way to pre school. The tunes are catchy and we both sing along very loudly, it's lots of fun."
3,Average and a little annoying,"Sure, my son likes this CD enough, but I find it a bit annoying. No one really needs to hear Mickey and Minnie Mouse sing. Those high voices are tough to sit through. They Might Be Giants have a few on this CD and those are not bad. Bottom line, your kid will probably like it - you, however, may not be as happy to listen to this one over and over again."
4,Hot Dog Hot Dog Hot Diggity Dog!,"My three year old loves the show and listening to this CD in the car. As a parent, some of the songs are catchy while others do seem a bit annoying. I don't think it's a bad one as kids music CD's go. My wife really likes the library and technology songs and for some reason I seem to enjoy the Mickey's Countdown song. The hot dog song is a longer version than the one they always play at the end of the show. Overall, it's worth your hard earned dough, if your child is into Mickey Mouse Clubhouse like mine is."
2,Not what we thought it was going to be.,"This is just not what we thought it was going to be. Most the songs, we have never heard of on Clubhouse. Only the first and last song are the only songs that we listen to."
2,Not what I expected.,"For some reason I was in the idea that it was songs from the show and it is definitely not. It's a mickey mouse version of traditional kids songs...plus the show's theme song. My kids get irritated with this immediately and it's rarely used. I see Disney channel is now having ""music videos"" with the various cartoon characters so the songs are becoming more familiar but this cd is not for us. If they put out another with more of the in show songs that'd be great but for now? This will be recycled to someone else."
3,my daughter loves it,well as a parent i don't like it obviously... there is nothing wrong with it.. just boring.. but my daughter gets a kick out of the cd and she's only 2..
5,Decent holsters,I recieved my package alot sooner than expected (Thank you Amazon).I bought this simple holster for a costume I was creating. I was very pleased to see that they do fit people with a small body frame. I have a a couple of gun holsters from another costume and they just didnt sit correctly like they should of. So thank you Airsplat for making something affordable and something that actually fits!
1,Not the Product the promise,Paid for expedite shipping and this product NEVER arrived the time it was promised by the seller. Item was returned without even being opened . Of Course We we not refunded the shipping though it was no fault of ours.
1,"Say It Ain't So, Dr Axline!","She didn't mean it, Dr Axline...she really meant to be non judgmental, and caring about the dignity and personhood of the child. I hope and pray that this is so and that this woman didn't just see money signs when she abused the innocence of 350 children in California...."
2,Not designed well,"This is a tough product and seems well made, but there are serious design issues that make this product a failure for anyone using it.1: Drill Holder - My 18v Dewalt XRP drill will not fit into the drill holder with the button snapped closed. So, the drill hangs there waiting to fall out of the sleeve, if I move the bucket. I wonder how many other drills will not fit into the drill holder.2: Screwdriver Storage - There are no proper screwdriver slots. All of the slots and pockets are closed on the bottom. This means that your screwdrivers will hang high over the slots, instead of fitting snug. Screwdrivers will most likely be lost on any job site, if the pockets are used.3: Way too expensivve - This product is worth $15 max, with its design flaws."
1,Cartoon looking,Terrible flag. It looks like someone made a cartoon picture from the real flag and it looks awful. DO NOT BUY THIS
2,greatly disappointed,I am greatly disappointed in this cd. Ray Charles was a musical genius but the selections on this cd just don't seem to be his 'style'.
1,Score one for fluff marketing,"There's something fishy about the couple of people who gave this CD of musical marketing tripe a 5-star review. Is it just me or do they sound suspiciously like Rhino Records employees in disguise, trying to boost sales?This album shows no respect for a deceased legend and music icon. It represents the ugly side of the music industry--the make a quick buck on others' coattails side of the industry... Many of the tracks were not only recorded when Ray was not present, but some of the people never met him! That's what I call karaoke. And I wonder why the record label decided not share any music clips from the album on Amazon?I have actually heard the album. Even with a beautiful voice like Alicia Keys on there, it's hard to ignore my churning stomach as I listen. That would be my sense of decency saying, ""This is just wrong!"""
1,Don't waste your money!,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I ordered, but I jumped the gun on this one! I liked the previous duets album, so pre-ordered this based on the artists that were paired with Ray Charles. However, although they try to do a good job, the songs themselves are really poorly chosen. Many I never heard, heard of, and unfortunately, wish I hadn't heard. Save your money and buy either the other album or one of Ray's originals..."
1,USELESS FOR YOUR IPOD,If you are buying this prodcut to put on your IPOD FOR GET ABOUT IT..IT WILL NOT WORK..J Records and Sony BMG have started incrypting there products to curtail Piracy however in doing so it has left us Ipod people out of the loop.....
1,feels very Cheap,"Ray Charles was a Musical Genius&He blended well on Colabs.I still enjoy the Country Collection I have of His from the early 80's,but this is plain Tacky&Wrong. the Man passed away just a year ago&these Record Companys trying to cash in ASAP with a formula.I didn't care at all for the last album&this One feels even more Artifical than that one did. I want to remember Ray Charles as he was as to hearing a Album thrown together to cash in."
3,Not quite there,"I was a little disapointed in the material selected for this compilation. The singers that joined him are no doubt great, but I just found this album to be lacking in emotion and R&B. If you want a great CD with Ray Charles along with others go right for Ray Charles in ""Genius Loves Company."" It will satisfy!!!"
3,Sequel to 'Genius Loves Company'??,This album has great singers starting with Ray Charles along with his guests and the arrangements are good but something is missing so it must be the material itself. It is not up to the standard of 'Genius Loves Company'. Were these tunes screened from the 'Genius Loves Company' album?? All is not lost though - super rendition of 'Imagine' and 'Blame It On The Sun'.
5,The Demon Headmaster,"The Demon Headmaster is a very gripping book. The T.V series has also brought a little bit of life into theseries of books by Gillian Cross. Overall, the epic tales of the Demon Headmaster and his plots and trickery to get hold of Dinah Hunter dipict a whole world of imaginative text in a sort of realistic realism. The book is a great oppurtunity for children of all ages to establish a truly great reading experience. I would recommend this book to all ages, especially the older teenage readers who like to get into a bit of sci-fi/adventure genre. By Ravindran Uthayakumar"
3,Decent guide book,"I liked that this book was focused just on Berlin, the only city I was visiting in Germany. I thought the desriptions were good and I used it to look up information on sights I knew I wanted to see. I didn't feel like it gave great direction on the must-see sights, unless you already knew to look for them.I found it helpful and was glad I bought it.Nothing about it really jumped out as remakrable to me. It was an adequate guide book and useful."
4,Spectacular originals and an amazing cover.,"Though I've been a fan of the Girls for quite a while, I didn't get this album until I heard Romeo and Juliet. Originally written by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits, Amy does a solo cover of it with amazing intensity and emotion. No matter how long I listen to it I never get tired of it. Ghost is also a true tear-jerker, and Airplane showcases their wide-ranging capabilities. Another favorite is Chickenman, though their live version on 1200 Curfews is several times better. BUY IT."
5,"The best CD by ""The Girls""",The songs on this album will make your spine tingle. From Galileo to Romeo and Juliet the lyrics will make you ponder life and love. I highly recommend this Cd to anyone who needs to hear just plain good music !
5,The Best of the Indigo Girls CDs,"I have owned this CD for years and even after Swamp Ophelia and Shaming of the Sun, I still think this is the best of all of the Indigo Girls CDs. Definitely worth buying if you're a new ear to the group.On a side note, they are incredible in concert!"
4,Nice compilation,It is a nice compilation if you just wanted a good sampling of Laura's work and the price is right.
4,Laura Nyro Definitive Collection,All I can say is genius..the songs have such powerful yet simple lyrics emphasized by a lovely voice. Was great- why is she not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?
4,Lacked some of my favorites,"While it was wonderful to hear that clear, clean voice (she doesn't need gimmicks), I was looking forward to hearing some of my personal favorites from her first album. While many songs that I love are represented here, I had to buy the ""First Songs"" CD also to round it out. But wait, I should focus on what was represented instead of what was missing. While her songs have long been a favorite of such diverse artists as Three Dog Night, Blood, Sweat and Tears, and Barbra Streisand, there is nothing that can compare to the artists renditions of her own work. To anyone who likes good songs, heartfelt lyrics with a heartful of soul and a little jazz thrown in for good measure, Laura Nyro is for you. Look at what's included on these CD'S and see just how many you recognize. Then listen to them in her voice. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed."
3,marred recording of mostly good music,"Unfortunately, none of the previous reviewers thought to mention that however good the music may be, a significant portion of this collection is hard to listen to because of poor engineering. Old recordings are simply thrown onto CD without any modifications/improvements. Hence, you get lots of splatter on higher notes (think tinny record player from the 60's). Classics like Stoney End, Billy's Song and Blowin' Away are the worst of the lot. If you don't mind skipping over the bad cuts, there will be something here for you. Consider buying this one second hand at a deep discount. UPDATE: someone wrote in comments that he did not experience the same problems. It is possible that mine is defective. A download would provide all the great music and avoid technical difficulties."
3,"Wonderful Songwriter, Terrible Singer","The only cut on this CD that works as a vocal is the haunting ""Billy's Blues."" Otherwise Ms. Nyro's singing voice is this incredibly unattractive soprano wailing all over the place; just like Sandra Bernhard when she tries to sing 'seriously'."
4,4 1/2 stars....Better than expected,"I was hooked right away. My first Connie Mason book but I already went out and bought 2 more. I hope they are all this good. Not quite as good as Beatrice Small stories but enjoyable to read. Good characters, good story line which I leave to others to describe. It had just enough of everything to make you want to keep reading. I understand about not recognizing Guy but you have to over look some of these things in our romance stories. This was a good story and I would recommend it to a friend and especially if you like pirate romance stories which I definitly do. I rated it 4 1/2 stars."
5,A Connie Mason Classic!,Her books are as always the classic fantasy of true love. This is definately a winner! Can't wait for the next one!
1,She didn't recognize him???Get real.,"the basis of this book is that the hero is not recognized by the heroine after only a 7 year absence. granted he had lost an eye in prisonbut the author seems to feel that an eye patch would cause someone tototally not recoginze the ""love of her life"" whom she has pined for as she believed he died in prison. while i know historical romance sometimes makes suspension of belief necessary, i could not buy into the rest of the plot nor the characters with so simple an explanation.i also could not believe that the heroine would forgive her father for lying to her for years that her son had been stillborn & for 'selling' her in marriage to the villan just for money..i felt as if connie mason ran out of original ideas and just threw together a ridiculous plot in which to place these poorly drawn characters."
3,Interesting,"This is the third Connie Mason novel that I have read and I found this one kind of boring. The plot was a little drawn out. This novel was pretty good, but Connie Mason has done better. For example, my favourite is The Dragon Lord. I highly recommend this novel, except that all others after may come as a disappointment. As I have mentioned, this novel is good but please take a look at The Dragon Lord by the same author. It is much, much better!!!"
1,Urgh!,"This was the WORST book by Connie Mason I have read till date.I like most of her novels, but The Pirate had such a predictable plot and such flat and boring characters, I stopped reading it midway.I really like her novels such as Sheik, but this one was just not worth reading."
5,One of My Favorites,"This is what romance novels are about. I fell hopeless in love with Guy De Young. My heart broke for him and what he had endured.The visual images are wonderful and it is very sexy.Great,Great book!READ IT!"
3,"Great parody, but with a limited market and at an expensive price","The movie is a great parody of the french film, La Jetee, which was the inspiration for 12 Monkeys, with Bruce Willis. Even if you have never seen La Jetee, you will recognize elements from 12 Monkeys in this parody.However, a reminder for those who may have missed it above, this disc is merely a DVD-R burned disc, not a professionally-pressed DVD. It is the only way to get this film on DVD, but the disc may have shorter longevity than a ""real"" DVD.As such, in my opinion it is slightly over-priced, but such is the cost of supporting an independent filmmaker who obviously spent some time and money making this. (Or supporting the company who financed the filmmaker and may now own the rights to the film).Those who have seen the film know whether they need to own it on disc or not. Others may want to skip this or look for it on cable on the Independent Film Channel (IFC), where it airs sometimes."
2,Joke wore a bit thin,"Anyone who does not get that this is a parody won't get past first 2 minutes.I got the joke, but only got past 5 minutes."
3,Dissapointing,"After buying the Walkmen's first album, Everyone Who Pretended To Like Me Is Gone, i was hoping their new album would show them progressing (although they didnt need to). i was surprised to find out that they took a step back.The elements that made the first album so amazing are missing on Bows and Arrows. The beautful raw sonic atmosphere is not present, now it is just raw and boring in some tracks.i hope the walkmen take two steps forward in progress after this dissapointing album"
2,Fifteen minutes ticks,"Sophomore slumpish release wearing its raggedness and derivative nature on sleeve in light of provoking material, if still providing occasional drunken grandeur."
3,"Sound like ""old U2""","Una banda que aparentemente podria ser de las monotonas bandas ""PUNK"" del monton, sin embargo queda en evidencia que el uso de sintetizadores le da un toque particular y le enriquece. Considerando esto yo no me atreveria a colocar a ""Walkmen"" como banda ""PUNK"".Lo primero a notar es el gran parecido que tiene con el ""U2"" de anta?o, sobre todo me recordo por momentos al ""Boy"" de U2, y un poco menos al ""October"". Logicamente ""Walkmen"" tiene un sonido mas sucio y distorcionado ya que es la tendencia actual.Energetico y agresivo vocalmente, guitarras agitadas e incicivas pero con casuales lineas melodicas dulces que le hacen sonar estupendo. En resumen Bows + Arrows es un buen cd, sin embargo tiene la constante intermitencia que caracteriza los albums de las bandas actuales. Personalmente seleccionaria el single ""The Rat"" como el mejor corte de este album."
1,"Overrated, and awful","One great song ""The Rat"" does not make a great album. The other songs are simply awful. Save your money."
2,"Is this it...god, i hope so.","Ok, a large number of lo-fi/garage groups have mimmicked the Strokes mimmicked formula (regardless of whether they were a pre-existing group or not), but this is mallet-over-the-head obvious. You can tell he's spent the past two years studying up on Julian's drawl. His demeanor on stage is even more embarrassingly hack. The lyrics are dull, the melody's are almost non-existent, and the only saving grace (the guitarmanship) is seconhand to even the most throwaway of Strokes tracks. Just buy Room on Fire instead. Don't waste your cash."
4,Perfect soundtrack to a winter's night out,"With a magnificent slow burn of a sound featuring dense textures and crackling vocals, this NYC quartet prove to be desperate, sentimental, and assuredly intoxicated, often all at once. ""What's In It For Me"" opens with supple organ and drifts along lightly before giving way to the rousing and superbly vitriolic ""The Rat."" With its shouts, groans, pulsing guitar and rhythm, it swiftly sets the album tumbling into motion and likely serves as the album's most emphatic moment. Thereafter the band manages to create a musical landscape that's always rigid around the edges, yet that always flirts with a subtle beauty. By the time you've passed through ""Hang On Siobhan"" and ""138th Street"" you can literally feel the piercing New York wind and smell the whiskey in the air. A great sophomore effort and a convincing musical backdrop for a winter's night out and the hangover that's sure to follow. Cheers."
2,second album slump,"Dissapointing after the excellent first album ""Everyone who pretended to like me is gone"". The sound is too raw and jangly with no bass to be heard. After a while it just sound like one big noisey song. The Walkmen crafted something highly original and beautiful on their first album but they lost their way a bit with this one."
3,Whats in it for me? Not as much as expected.,"I know no one wants to hear comparisons in reviews, but I just have to. This CD pales in comparison to ""Everyone Who Pretended To Like Me..."" That album had a very dreamland feel to it, well, he woke up. The CD starts strong with ""Whats In It For Me"", A very Dreamy slow moving tune. It then goes to the first single ""The Rat"", while it is a good song it isn't up to par with the previous song. It has a very upbeat tempo, almost Strokes-esque. After that I really cant think of any standout songs. Perhaps ""Hang On Siobhan"". Walter's voice is still as good as ever, but the voice of the band has changed, A lot less piano and rolling drums, a lot more rock. This is not a bad CD, but if your expecting another ""Everyone..."" look elsewhere."
4,"Some Day, You Will Ache Like I Ache...","Sad that their `fame' came from a Saturn commercial, because how The Walkmen distinguish themselves is how fresh and charming they are - they are the anti-New York garage scene while embodying it's ideal...to make beautiful, raw, emotional, gut-wrenching neo-standards. Hamilton Leithauser possesses something the so-called purveyors of Garage Rock like The Strokes lack - endurance and passion - which will inevitably land him on `The O.C.' Atmospheric, aching, rocking and haunting all juxtaposed to create the most gorgeous collage and the NYC CD of this year. And maybe next. My grade: A-"
3,Sounded better live,I saw this group on Conan and liked their energy. I ordered the CD and have to say I was disappointed. The energy of their live show did not come thru on this CD.
4,Destiny brought us together,"In Tower Records Tokyo I stumbled across The Walkmen's first release ""Everyone..."" and bought it purely because I liked the cover. Sometimes impulsiveness has its rewards and I've been hooked and transfixed ever since. As corny as it sounds, when one gives time to this record one enters into a secret club that not everyone but those that GET IT wish to join.When I heard that their new record ""Bows and Arrows"" was out I picked it up- plugged it into my CD Walkman and expectantly went out into a cold January night. The first track was slow, atmospheric (not altogether unexpected) and I continued to keep walking. But when track 2 kicked in (""The Rat"")with all its guitar surging, hair standing on end magnificence- well all love for this band went to a new place.Other particular goodies on this record ""My Old Man"", ""The North Pole"" and ""Thinking of a Dream I Had"". The latter will always remind me of standing on a Subway platform- something I used to do a lot."
4,more than you think,"the vocal delivery is bob dylan all the way (and I mean that in a good way of course). Forget all of this U2/radiohead/strokes indi-crank comparison laziness. The music is a story being told not to do with the words being said. Minimilist in a very ubiquitous manner.The highs are high and the rest is enough to sustain you.Moment of the album is the organ on 'bows and arrows' providing more than enough to ""face the day"".Will you be happy you bought it? - yes"
2,"Average set of tracks, with one killer standout.","I bought it used for the single ""The Rat"". Great track. Worth the price. The other tracks are so-so. However, like I stated, worth the price just for that one track."
4,Very good record.,"I was surprised that I really liked this record. I didn't expect much from a post-JF*E band, especially since I saw JF*E several times throughout their career and while they started off absolutely brilliant, they ended in shambles. I guess the guys who went on to the Walkmen kicked whatever was getting them down because this is a very solid, enjoyable record. Bits of it sound familiar (although the end organ line on ""Thinking of a Dream I Had"" is *exceptionally* reminiscent of Slim Smith's ""Everybody Needs Love""), but fresh at the same time. Highly recommended."
4,Great Album,"The Walkmen's ""Bows & Arrows"" is for me one of the best releases of the year. For the casual listener the album might be abrasive, but upon repeated listening the LP is really great. Highlights include ""the rat,"" ""Little House Of Savages,"" ""Thinking Of A Dream I Had,"" and ""My Old Man."" ""Hang On Siobhan"" is the song that fits the album the most. It is by far the quietest and most poignant recording on the album. The Walkmen are not quite pop enough for this album to get much airtime, but ""Bows & Arrows"" is easily one of the top 5 albums of 2004. I highly recommend this album for fans of Interpol, Idlewild and Franz Ferdinand."
4,Pretty pretty good.,"I liked Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me is gone better, personally. But it's pretty different. So instead of comparing, I will just leave it at ""this is a very good CD."""
3,A Make-or-Break Proposition,"The Walkmen's Hamilton Leithauser phrases like a drunken Ray Davies circa-Muswell Hillbillies. On their second offering Bows + Arrows, Leithauser stumbles through the 11 tracks like a dandy high on absinthe. The band has a tendency to take basic alt-rock structures and warp them. Guitarist Paul Maroon loves sustain. Bassist Pete Bauer could hold his own in a Joy Division/New Order tribute band. But Leithauser's voice is the make-or-break proposition. On the raging rockers - ""Little House of Savages"", ""My Old Man"", ""Thinking of a Dream I Had"", and the fierce ""The Rat"" - they make it. Whenever they slow the tempo, the vocals get so wobbly and unfocussed I reach for my own drink."
1,Do NOT waste your time,"The angle of the blade makes it very hard to get an even cut. Basic slices, like potato, were thicker on one end than the other no matter what technique or effore was made. Waffle fries are NOT happening with this thing. The depth of the serated blade was too shallow to allow for a real waffle cut, and the 'thicker on one end' symptom described above makes it extra impossible.I promptly returned it."
5,MIU stainless- steel professional mandoline slicer,"This is a quality mandoline. It is sturdy, and well designed. I have used many different kinds of mandolines in the industry, and this is one of the best."
5,High Quality Low Price,I have owned this model for about 3 years. I just learned how to use it properly and bought one for a friend. several interchangable blades allow for several different cuts and sizes. All metal and quality plastic fairly easy to clean.
1,Misled by Good to Great Reviews This is JUNK-DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this mandoline a while back after doing some research, reading reviews etc.. First time I tried the straight blade I discovered the plastic holding the blade had chipped, undoubtedbly getting into the finished food product.. MIU must be a shadow company since there doesn't seem to be a way to directly contact them.. just the importing company which does not offer any help at all. The Stainless frame is impressive but the rest of the package is complete junk.. Don't know why folks liked it, maybe they haven't noticed the black flecks of plastic in their sliced potatoes or how fragile all the plastic parts are yet. THIS IS A DO NOT BUY if it ever does come back on sale at amazon or anywhere else. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT and send a message to MIU (if you can get a hold of them) to stand behind what they contract the Chinese factories to build for them.. Would have given it zero stars if I could."
4,mandoline,"Great product, however I do like the older model with the fixed blade better. Also not as Sharp as I thought it would be out of the box, but that's an easy fix! All in all very pleased!"
2,Overrated and not as good as cheaper models,"I have a cheap plastic mandoline that I have used for a while, and thought I would step up to a ""pro"" model. So far I have had nothing but disappointment with this mandoline. The hand guard has broken or malfunctioned twice, and it tends to make a mess of slicing, say, zucchini. While it looks great in theory, it's not as good (or as easy to use (as the $13 plastic one I bought at a grocery store. Save your money."
3,Blade design faulty,"I bought my MUI France mandolin many years ago. It is a Mach 6. I loved it at first but the prongs on the guide chipped some of the black plastic off the blades. When I ordered a replacement I noticed that it had a slightly different design. I won't try to describe the difference but the result was it created a lip and caused items to ""catch"" on a lip between the blade and the stainless steel unit. I did not have this issue with the original design. I described this issue to the company and they sent me replacement blades that have the same issue. I hope to be able to take it into them directly and show them the problem. I loved the original unit but with this design fault (that may come on all the newer units) it makes the unit virtually unusable."
4,Excellent kitchen tool,"Since cooking is a serious hobby for me I spend a lot of time in the kitchen, good equipment is very important to me and this mandoline is the most useful and versatile addition."
2,Difficult to get consistent cuts,"The thickness of slices is regulated by a lever under a slanted platform. When you put needed pressure on the food to push it through the blade, it causes the platform to move, which in turn changes the thickness of the slices. The julienne blade does not stay in place, but moves out of its slot while in use unless you hold it with one finger. The safety pusher will not hold thinner pieces and tends to bounce up. This makes it not only hard to use, but also can pinch fingers. Ditto the comment about blades being so-so; this works best on foods like zucchini with a similar overall texture, rather than tomatoes (hard to cut skin) or potatoes (overall too firm)."
1,Buy a v-slicer instead,"I bought this mandoline as a present for my wife. I felt confident in my purchase after reading the reviews on amazon. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment. We followed the instructions and the advice on amazon, but could not get this thing to work. Every food item we tried, hard or soft, big or small, got jammed. My wife has gone back to using her v-slicer, which functions well, but lacks the stainless appeal of this mandoline. Needless to say, I returned this item to amazon for a refund."
1,I can use a mandoline . . . and this one is not good,"I received this mandoline for Christmas and immediately put it to work cutting an apple. I could not slice with it, and it was a mess. The next day I tried potatoes, and little plastic bits chipped off in my slices (actually, chunks) as I tried to get it to work. Then last night at a cooking class, I used a simple, cheaper, plastic V-slicer, and it cut potatoes like they were made of cotton candy. Several cooks at my table, all first time mandoline users, had no problem slicing apples and potatoes with that mandoline. My conclusion - my technique was not crappy, this MIU mandoline is. Luckily I could return at no charge and pick up a Borner V-slicer Pro just like the one we used in the cooking class."
1,defective blade,This mandoline looked nice and solid. Trying to use it was another story. I only used it one time to slice sweet potatoes very thinly to make chips. The slicing blade has a plastic bottom with a steel blade. After one use much of the plastic on the bottom of the blade chipped off. I returned it for a refund.
3,mandoline slicer,Excellent shipper. Blades on slicer seem inferior requiring a great deal of pressure to make it work
2,Disappointed,"I found the cutting blade to be too dull to be effective. I wrote the company to complain, but got no response. I think a good knife works a whole lot better than messing with the mandoline"
1,"France no, China yes.","Under product description it clearly states this is a French made product.Well not only is it not from France, it is from China.MIU no, Culinary Concepts yes.What is going on here. I feel as though I was deliberately decived by the manufacturer of this product. If life wasn't so short I would put this thing back in the box it came in and send it back to where ever it came from and demand my money back. Alas, the extent of my efforts will end here with a warning for you. Unless you want another useless piece of junk in your house, dont waste your time with this thing."
2,Get a Japanese slicer instead,"Despite its fancy carrying case and claims in the instructions that I'd better be careful because of the mega-sharp blades, I was disappointed in its performance. I thought the blades were pretty poor and required a lot of effort to get slices done -- and as a result, the slices weren't very pretty. Cutting things with tougher skins like red bell peppers just didn't work well at all. I ended up giving this to my mother-in-law, and picked up a Japanese V-shaped plastic slicer from an Asian market instead -- and the blade on that is AMAZING. I was cutting scallions into paper-thin slices, and the motion I used was akin to painting with a paint brush -- that little effort was needed. Oh, and it cost me $16. The Japanese make the best, sharpest blades for sure -- just watch your fingers."
3,"Nice product, dull blade","The construction of this mandoline is very nice. Love the product.However, on arrival, the slicing and waffle blades were EXTREMELY dull, such that anything I tried to cut would break halfway through the cut.I contacted MIU and they are sending replacement blades. I will update once I receive them."
1,Blades don't cut. Period.,"Title say it all. Blades are also pretty much impossible to sharpen by hand. I tried with sharpening stones, even with a Dremel and could not get these things to cut. Add the two hours wasted in sharpening time to the 80 bucks wasted for the mandolin and you can see why I wish that I bought a piece of crap for [...] bucks rather than a piece of crap for [...] bucks. In fact the old $[...] mandolin cut much better than this.Oh yeah, don't read the French name and think the mandolin is French made. It's Chinese garbage just like everything else that comes out of that country. Bottom line... if you want a nice mandolin, look elsewhere."
4,mandolin slicer,"I got it and it seems to be very hard to slice vegetables. maybe the edge needs to be sharpened, right off the bat. hope not. i will keep trying to slice veggies and get used to it before I complain."
3,Hapazard Packaging,"The music gets 5 stars, but this release has no liner notes, and worse still, no listing of musicians. Unacceptable behavior on the part of the CD's producers..."
3,I like it.,Great author and illustrator. Good story... but much too long. My students were ready for it to end.
5,The ultimate onion!,"This is the ultimate British pickled onion! A strong flavour - sharp, crisp and most definitely not sweet. Just perfect with a sharp cheese and crusty bread. A little bit of Britain, in one, perfect, mouthful."
2,"I like these pickled onions, but...","I used to buy these at my grocer's and cannot find them locally now, so I considered buying these on Amazon. Be very aware of the pricing for these - the onions are good, but not that good. They have a malty flavor from the use of malt instead of white vinegar...if you love malt vinegar, then maybe it will be worth it to you. If not, just get the variety your supermarket sells."
2,Be Careful when choosing this item,"I bought this for my 2005 Kia Sedona. The description indicated it would fit. I did not fit. I called the manufacturer and was told that it was not intended for my vehicle. To ensure you get the right part, I suggest calling the manufacturer to confirm compatability."
1,How insulting!,"In essence, this book defines a gentleman as a person who can effectively mask his lack of taste and knowledge in an effort to get close enough to women to have sex with them. I've never read a book that used the word ""sneer"" so many times. It prides itself on its ""let's-update-bubba"" tactics, and largely advocates lying about one's life as a means to convince others that one is actually a well-mannered, educated, broad-thinking individual. I am disgusted and appalled that I wasted my money on such a low-brow, puerile piece of trash as this."
1,Not a true gentleman,"I checked this book out (did not purchase it, fortunately) after reading a tacky article by the author on MSN.com about how a woman can best ""romance a man"". I actually checked out the book because I could not believe, after reading the MSN article, that the author had really written a book on how to be a ""gentleman"" and I had to see for myself what it had to say. It was as tacky as the article in MSN. A true gentleman is true to himself and is who he says and appears to be."
1,Sleazy,"I think we'd be better off going to church. I normally have all the dates I want, some of them so hot I'm actually embarrassed a bit, but after reading this bad boy, my success rate fell off, until I got it out of my head. Fortunately, that didn't take too long!"
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"IT IS A SHAME THAT SUCH A TALENTED ACTOR WAS WASTED ON SUCH A HORRIBLE SCRIPT. THE STORYLINE COULD HAVE BEEN WORKABLE BUT THE LINES RUINED IT. COSTAS GAVE A FINE PERFORMANCE BUT HIS FELLOW ACTORS JUST SEEMED TO MAKE THE MOVIE ""B-RATED""."
4,Excellent guide.,"This guide is outstanding. For inside looks at the employers themselves, I'd also recommend the ""Vault Reports"" guides from VaultReports.com."
2,Does not fit correctly,"I bought this bolt for my Creftsman Professional 42 inch deck tractor. The picture is like the ones on the deck, however I was sent the flat washer type and they don't hold the mowing blade tightly to the spindle assembly. I had to shim them so I could tighten the blades. I have found another seller who has the correct ones. If the mowing blade does not fit tightly it damages the lower spindle and will not hold the blade corectly."
5,"Excellent movie, interesting book, fascinating man",Many years ago I saw the film of the same title about von Werraon TV and I never forgot it. Hardy Kruger gave a wonderful performance of the complex German pilot von Werra. I finally found the book that the film was based on and very glad I did as it expands on the film and tells far more of what happened to von Werra after he escaped from Canada. I definately recommend this book (and the film too) to everyone.
4,point of view in the one that got away...,"for the most part i liked the book. it covers a section of history that i find to be quite interesting. however, i often wondered how leasor had such access to the flyer's thoughts. at times the book read more like fiction than fact."
4,"If you need the facts, and you need them quick...","If you need the facts about World War II, and you need them quick, The Historical Encyclopedia of World War II is a great source to get your info from! Although, the pieces in this book are fairly short, the point is made, and the facts are given, making this a great choice for students to use in those pesky research papers! I would definatly recommend this book to the avid fact-finder. However, if you're a history scholar of some kind, or if your planning to read for the pleasure factor, this book is probably not the greatest choice. Like I said earlier, this is the book to have for finding out the facts about WWII. I think it's also a great choice for history teachers to have in the class room for their students to have access to."
5,Fast Service,I ordered my cutters on a Thursday and received them on Saturday. They were brand new and still in wrapper. I would definitely order from this company again.
5,Touches the senses,As a lighting director in both theatre and opera I can only say that this book show the beautiful creativity of stage and lighting design. We are given a behind the scenes look into the relationship between the designer and the stage artist. Definitely a must for anyone in the technical design part of theatre.
5,Kinetic Fantasies,"Wonder has been around for quite a while and has developed quite an amazing body of work. His early work with Wilfred Minks and his 80's and 90's work with the late, great Heiner Mueller certainly influenced this visionary artist. That being said, this book showcases Wonder's profound and startling theatrical visions. His work process is showcased in an organic way throughout this book. The rough sketches often surround the photos of the models of his designs. The production photos do great justice to the premise made by the book that his work is cinematic and about light and space.The photos are lavish and express the time-space continuim of his work within a specific design. The interviews were insightful. I enjoyed his writings about his designs and his images a lot.It is a must for any designer in the theatre or anyone interested in space or light."
4,Silly but Fun,"I was buying a Misfits record in a record store in Chicago ca. 2002 when the hipster check out guy started telling about this concept, that there was this band called the Goblins who allegedly found all this old Misfits material, etc. I thought he was high or putting me on, or both. But years later I found the CD and laughed for a few minutes. Some of the songs are ok parodies, others not. I wouldn't spend money on it, but if you're a big Misfits fan like me, you'll have fun with it at parties and stuff. After leaving the record store I met this guy on the street and we talked about Green Lantern and he told me was a personal friend of Wesley Willis."
1,"a good idea, but poorly executed...","i bought this cd yesterday from a local music store. i spent 8 bucks on a used copy, and honestly, if i'd had known what was in store, i wouldn't have spent 8 cents on this rip off. the goblins started with a classy idea - a concept album claiming to have found unreleased misfits songs from the danzig-era. however, most of these songs are under two minutes (with quite a few under one minute), and the last two numbers being instrumentals. the cd is ONLY THIRTEEN MINUTES LONG. i wasn't even 5 miles away from the music store and the cd was already over.my thoughts? stick with the misfits boxed set, or at least ""walk amoung us."" if you really want another band that is misfits-influenced, get Son of Sam or an AFI cd. The Goblin's ""Missing Fits"" is a total waste of money."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with condition of the book I purchased based on the description provided. Pages are water stained and there is some writing on one page.
2,Sounds like Bush ...,"I am not going to bother with a track by track break down of this album. I'll let my fellow reviewers do that. It's not that this album is bad or that the band is untalented. I give Trapt credit for their ability, it's just that this album has a very generic modern rock sound to it. Their sound does not stand out at all. The guitars and vocals remind me of Gavin Rossdale and early Bush albums. Overall this is a mediocre album of an over produced band."
1,Who gave these guys a record deal?,"Now granted I did purchase this CD and I have listened to it all the way through. One question came to mind as I was listening to the lead single ""Stand Up"". Why try to reproduce the success of a song like ""Headstrong""? I'm sure like ""Headstrong"" that lost its flavor after the first time of listening; ""Stand Up"" will also explode and fizzle out like a ninety nine cent bottle rocket at the Dollar Tree. I am sad to say that I want my forty something minutes back. This album showed no signs of evolving or making them self's better after a three year wait. In other words if you are not a thirteen year old girl you will strongly object to the making of anymore CD's by this band."
1,STUPID CRAP THAT STUPID KIDS WITH NO TASTE LIKE!!!!!!!!!!!,"first off this album and band suck, second off this album and band suck. my friend likes this retarted music but what doesn't make sense is that he likes led zeppelin and metallica. the singer is so bad and generic that I can't stand it. the lyrics are even worse. the drummer is playing any random beats that come to his head. and the bass, wait where is the bass?????? to rap it up, this is crappy generic nu-metal music that sucks and should be outlawed somehow. if you stupid trapt fans heard any iron maiden (who i'm listening to now) you would cry and ask Mommy where all the awsome music is coming from. (i don't care if that last comment didn't make sense)"
4,Trapt are back.....about time,"Lets all unite here and say most of us got hooked on Trapt after hearing Headstrong from their extremelly powerful and almost very much under rated Debut.For fans who enjoyed the Debut you will find this album has a great sound from track one.However, after listening to about half way into the album I sort of feel we are hearing the same old stuff from Trapt. Normally I feel this way about most of the sophomore efforts of bands i like (Linkin Park's Meteora, Papa Roach's Love Hate Tradegy)But I will give it time. I know these guys have done a deal of effort to make this album, so gratz to them for that.However, for newbie Trapt fans, this will be a great album.I think over time i will enjoy this album alot.So no real bad things to say about this albumIts just Trapt doing what they do best"
5,Greatest Album of the Year,"Someone in control is no better than their first album but it's still a great one. Waiting, Bleed like me, Influence, Use me to use you, and lost realist are great songs. Trapt didn't dissapoint me I loved their new album and I still think is the best Rock Band EVER."
2,Nu-rock = Poppy rock,"I actually tend to agree with fallen""mike"" in what he says about these so called nu-metal bands, the lead singers all have extremely similar voices, the guitar riffs get into a rut, and the solo work often is very minimal compared to old metal or more traditional heavy metal which still has quite a large following itself, i have no problem that a trapt CD may touch a Children of Bodom CD, Unlike fallen mike i do not beleive that the CD's will effect one another... however i would reccomend that listeners of nu- metal at least look into some more traditional metal bands such as Black label society, or children of Bodom. And nu-metal... cmon its just poppy metal."
5,Pretty Good,"I don't know what all these other reviewers are talking about, because I really like these guys. It is a very nice mix of light and hard rock. I haven't finished listening to this cd yet, but the songs that I have heard and like are ""Disconnected(Out of Touch)"" and ""Skin Deep."" I definately think that this cd is worth the small price point(I got it for $10). Absolutely worth checking out."
3,Why did they rush to slow down?,"When Trapt's self-titled debut came out, I was amazed, I could not take the CD out of my CD player for anything. I thought that there was no way they could get worse, but this release disappointed me. After the long wait, I think they could have given us something much better.The CD is not a total waste, and I'm sure there are people out there who disagree with me very much. I just didn't feel that they lived up to their potential. They lyrics are lacking, STAND UP is probably the ""hardest"" rock song, and it reminds me a lot of the old Trapt.Lost Realist has to be the next single, it is the best song on the CD, probably the slowest, more melodic, but awesome. This CD is worth $10 or less I suppose...just don't expect too much."
3,Barely half as good as their debut.,"I give it 2.5 stars. There just wasn't anything on here to keep me coming back. Maybe once every couple years I'll say, ""I feel like listening to Trapt"" and I'll give it one spin, but there is so much more out there that is better. I really liked the debut, but talk about sophomore slump here. They better get their acts together."
2,Disappointed,"2 songs, thats it, i was really dissapointed with this album, Repeat Offender, Waiting, iTunes is the way to go here, if u want to get those two songs, but the rest of the album just lacks what they had in the first album, really, not worth buying the album 2 stars = 2 ok songs"
4,fun stuff....,"Yup, good effort from the big guy...always have had a soft spot in my heart for Sleepy, but he's suffered from occasionally uneven musical efforts. This one's a lot of fun. I've managed to annoy my neighbors playing his version of Little Richard's ""Rip it Up"" over and over again.Check out that price too....good intro to Sleepy LaBeef"
4,"good, but...","It's good, and I'm glad to have it, but Effortless is much better... the producers are well known and it has a real CCM feel, but it seems over produced and it seems to not reflect Rita Springer as we love her... HOWEVER, the bonus cd is makes it ""worth it all."" You really want to worship!"
1,2010 Toyota Tacoma,"Be aware buyers. This product doesn't fit with my 2010 Tacoma, Pre-Runner SR5.I checked this product out on Putco website and it clearly says that this product is not fit with model year from 2009 to 2011."
3,not so pleased..,it did not fit as specefied i had tomake a hole for my back up camera ithink it was for models under 2008.
5,looks good!!,if u want something visually attractive with them glossy chrome this thing look good especially on my 06 black tacoma.i recommend the product.
3,Does not whip up as high as HONEYVILLE brand,"I have used the Honeyville brand over the last two years. As a professional baker it matters a lot to me that the egg whites whip up high. These do not whip as high. Also, I discovered that it takes 3tsp of this product compared with 2tsp of the other to mix with 1 T of water to equal one white. That makes this product more expensive than I had thought."
5,good product,I could not find this product in any stores in my area. This was the last ingrediant I needed. It worked great and the cakes were amazing!
2,Doesn't dissolve easily,"I bought this product because a review I read said it dissolved easily. It doesn't dissolve in cold broth, it just clumps up, and heating the mess cooked the egg powder into hard lumps. When one is nauseous from chemo and trying to get some nutrition down, this is NOT satisfactory. If there is a secret method of how to make this work, it wasn't on the packaging."
4,Nice Texas Bag,"Living in Texas, a full sleeping bag with all the bells and whistles is not always necessary. I like this one alot. Good price. My only problem is the zipper for us bigger folks. It has a tendency to unzip if you lean up on it."
2,Failed after 2 years,"Just like another reviewer here, I had my SmartStrip fail after 2 years (2 years, 3 months to be exact). Until then it was a reliable auto-switching strip with a long 6' cord. But really I expect more than 2 years of service from this type of item.I've used the company webpage to send customer service a message, so we'll see how they handle the situation. Normally, I'd call, but this close to the holidays I figure I'd opt for the more low-key e-mail attempt first.Update: The manufacturer (Bits Limited) got back to me pretty quickly with an RMA number to return the strip. I shipped it back to them, they repaired it, upgraded it with the latest fixes, and returned it. Overall pretty good customer service, I would have liked it if they paid shipping back to them, but it wasn't too expensive (FL, USA)."
4,Works fine... most of the time,"Works great most of the time. Sometimes it takes a while for the strip to know it's supposed to be 'off', but I adjusted it a few times and it seems to be mostly ok now. It's totally worth it to prevent parasitic devices like my TV, PS3 and subwoofer from constantly sucking power."
4,just plug it in and your set.,"just plug them in and wait for the savings, no adjustments were required for mine."
1,Buzzing Failure Redux,"This worked, more or less, for awhile. It was difficult to adjust so that it would turn off the peripherals. Then it began to buzz loudly for several minutes whenever activated. That seemed to be a relay failure, turning the controlled devices on and off rapidly. Not good, and could damage your devices. Don't buy this."
5,"These things are great, even though ....","... even though the sensitivity settings are very crucial. You see, I have one that actuates with a computer, enough current so there is no guessing for the device to trigger the other fringe devices. But this one I have connected to only a box fan and the current is so small that I often have to play with the sensitivity setting in order to get the other fan to start up too. Sometimes it will start and keep going when the main fan stops, so I turn the sensitivity down and it works for a while longer that way, then may have to adjust it later to increase.Can't figure a sure work around yet, but not so bad really."
1,Cannot recommend it,"Followed the instructions faithfully. Plugged the TV into the ""control"" outlet. After I turned the TV off, my receiver would randomly turn on and off on its own. Tried all the suggested adjustments. Nothing worked. Save your money."
3,Smart strip pretty touchy,"It took several tries to ""train"" the smart strip to affect my speakers, my monitor, and my printer at the same time. In addition, after you use the primary outlet for the computer, and two of the ""constant"" outlets, you really only have 4 outlets for peripherals, which was somewhat fewer than I was expecting. Maybe I just need to read the description, though."
2,"Great Idea, no Cigar",Dose not work if the prim equipment is powered by a low voltage transformer (brick).
5,Great power saver,"This power strip is excellent. It allows me to leave everything else on and when I turn off my computer, the monitor and speakers shut off automatically without me having to hit a power switch. That seems a bit lazy, but Windows computer take so long to shut down some times that I don't want to stand there and wait for it to shut down. This eliminates that need.Well worth it."
2,Buzzing Failure After Two Years Use,"I purchased this at Amazon two years ago. It worked fine for two years, then last night a loud buzzing noise emanated from the power strip, which woke the whole household. No matter what I plugged into the top plug, the control plug, the buzzing started again. I did expect a longer lifetime for this power strip."
3,can't get to work with iMac energy saving settings,"I was excited to try the Smart Strip product, and it works as advertised as long as I manually turn off my main device (iMac). Unfortunately, it's not nearly as useful as I had hoped since it doesn't properly detect when my iMac puts itself to sleep and then turn off the power. I've tried adjusting the potentiometer in case it's a matter of the Smart Strip's setting, but the result is the same."
1,Good Luck,"I thought it was a good way to be green and protect my home theater system . While Sitting in our family room with our home theater system off, fully connected to the Smart Strip. A storm came through,a nearby lightning strike and there was a pop in our receiver. Our circuit breaker was blown and the receiver was blown. I spoke with Blitz LTD (Blitz Ltd owns the company of the Smart Strip)and was told to send the receiver out for a repair estimate and they would put in a claim for me with the company. The repair company stated the damage to the receiver was due to a power surge, and Blitz Ltd denied the claim saying they had NO PROOF the receiver was connected to the strip.They said If they paid claims related to power surges like mine they would be out of business. Meanwhile their packaging states clearly $30,000. connected equipment warranty protection. Good Luck"
3,Lacks Underwriter's Laboratory Listing,"This surge strip looks OK, and the switching of the ""slave"" outlets works well once the sensitivity is adjusted, BUT it is not a UL Listed Device. It is ""ETL Listed"", but it makes one wonder why a manufacturer confident in its products' safety would skip UL Listing. It may be safe, and it may work as intended, but if it doesn't, one wouldn't know until there is a shock, fire, or an equipment-damaging surge.I didn't know it was legal to import non-UL Listed electrical devices, and If I had known this item wasn't UL Listed, I would have eliminated it from my consideration list."
2,Jesus Jones Casts Doubt on new Rock-n-Roll Sound,"Jesus Jones has gone almost purely rock-and-roll on this album, but unfortunately have performed terribly. On past albums like ""Perverse"" and ""Doubt,"" the offered us an artistic, melodic rock and roll sound also, but intertwined with cool sound effects and often danceability. This album just doesn't ""rock"" at all -- It sounds like weak pretty-boy rock. Previously, their work had an artistic appeal that made them unique among the bands, but these songs don't compare. There best album is definitely ""Perverse,"" so this album is not for those new to Jesus Jones. This album is not recommened."
5,chinese woven hat,This was a great buy. I bought this hat for a friend who enjoys wearing this type of hat while doing yard work. It was very well made and worth every cent I paid for it.
1,so where is buenos aires????,"LP guides are usually complete and thorough. so why is the section on buenos aires in this one so carelesly researched? is it because LP wants us to buy their book on buenos aires or because their researchers didn't visit the city at all? i've been to buenos aires countless times. reading the LP guide, one would think that it is just a hamlet not worth wasting your time on. buenos aires is one of the most exciting and mysterious places in the world; a european outpost in south america, full of chic decadence and a lot more than just beef and tango. entire districts are overlooked by the guide, descriptions are misleading or incomplete and uninviting at best. one wonders why. if you're looking for a guide to buenos aires, buy yourself a plane ticket and a map. once in the city, meet the locals. this is one city you need to explore and understand rather than just see. as jorge luis borges once said: ''it would seem that buenos aires has existed forever.''"
2,LP Guide Slights Buenos Aires,"Though I had this book when I visited Buenos Aires, I found it utterly useless. I stayed with a group of friends who are natives of this incredible city and so I was able to rely on their information about cool neighborhoods and off-beat places. Though LP prides itself on offering this kind of information, this edition has little that allows travelers to discover the city's uniqueness. Instead, I used this guide to find museums and other basic info that I could have gleaned from ANY guide. It's hard to believe that LP included hardly any information about Palermo, one of the city's most charming neighborhoods, or failed to mention the tradition of Milongas, which are ""local"" dances in venues such as community centers where everyday Portenos dance the tango with more grace and passion than you will find in the expensive, touristy shows. It's rather disappointing considering that the LP published an entire city guide on this capital."
2,There are Better Child Phycology Books,"I purchased Child and Adolescent Development for Educators by Judith L. Meece for a lateral entry teaching class. This book is poorly written with a great deal of fluff. The graphs and other figures are severely lacking. For example in just the first chapter there were a couple graphs that did not even have the axises labeled and the axises were not described in the caption. Some sections are written like journal articles, while others seem to be filled with little actual information. At the same time I was taking the course and reading this book my husband was taking the same class at a different school with a different book. His book had the same information, but it was much easier to read and most of the information was a supported by the figures provided or summed up in a table."
3,not on time,"i ned my book in date that they offers, the did not be on time in that date i paid the shipment class to obtein it on tima"
4,Pretty darn good,"I love authors who are able to spin fascinating tells. When I finish The Kingdoms and the Elves books by Robert Stanek, this series was recommended to me. While I liked the first one, I truly loved this one. I never would have thought a Peter Pan prequel would have been so good."
3,Not my favorite book,"This series is very creative but I found myself asking the author why he chose to make it into a corny book along with the creativeness. The whole starcatchers part of the plot i find very silly. Especially in the first book with the girl talking to dolphins. The book was good enough but could have been better. Read on an airplane maybe when there is nothing to do or when you have a lot of time on your hands. I thought it was a little boring but thats just my opinion, you should read it anyways.Courtney <3"
4,Great adventure for the family!,"We started with the Audio Book Peter and the Starcatchers on our way down to Florida. We loved that book so much (9hours, not a bad way to ride with quiet 6, 9, and 11 year olds)that we had to get the sequel for the ride back. Was able to order it from Amazon and shipped to my parents house in time for it to ride back with us to Tennessee. We enjoyed the Shadowthieves as well (again, a quiet ride back with 3 kids, priceless). By the time we pulled in to the driveway we had started the last chapter. We sat in the car for another 15 mins waiting for the book to finish. Great memory building moments for the kids in the car."
4,Great book for fantasy fans,"My ten-year-old son was given the first book in this trilogyPeter and the Starcatchers(why is every story a trilogy or series lately?) and loved it, so on his insistence, I ordered ""Peter and the Shadow Theives"". I'd been looking for a good book to keep him reading, something more challenging than simple early readers, and this fit the bill, as he prefers fantasy. The story is a look into what happened to Peter Pan before he went to visit Wendy and her brothers in the classic Peter Pan story. The best review I can give is to say he grabbed the book as soon as it came and was glued to it until he finished a few days later! He went on to read the last in the seriesPeter and the Secret of Rundoon (The Starcatchers). On the down side, you will probably have to buy books one and three if you buy this book, so be warned."
4,Adventure Abounds,What a fun adventure story for people of all ages. A nice sequel to Peter and the StarCatchers. I love Jim Dale's narration of the audio book!
4,Peter and the Shadow Thieves,"After reading 'Peter and Starcatchers' together with my 8-year old son, we eagerly continued with 'Peter and the Shadow Thieves'. Unfortunately, my son & I had to stop reading this book together about 1/2 way through because it was a bit too scary for him (he's a very imaginative child). My son found the Lord Ombra character too scary and did not admit this to me, until he told me one night that he did not want to go to sleep without the lights on. My son & I enjoyed the pirate dialogue and action in both of the books. (I finished the book myself, and then told my son of the ending- easing his fear of Lord Ombra.) I would highly recommend this book for boys who like action (esp. pirate action) and could handle a little bit of scariness (referring to Lord Ombra)."
4,"Finally, it's out.","Peter and the Shadow Thieves has finally been released and now I've read it. If you read and liked the previous entry in this series Peter and the Star Catchers, you'll also like this book as well. If you didn't, you just might like this anyway.As prequels to JM Barrie's famous Peter Pan, they have some limitations. This one, though, is freed of the first novel's need to end up at a certain place in time. At least that's my take. I liked this one a bit better. The plot was more interesting, and it was less of a child's book. Even Mr. Barrie himself has a cameo in this one, though if you're not paying attention you might not realize that's what it is.Like all children's books this one is a bit predictable but I don't fault the authors because in general that's how the genre plays out. The book's a bit short on character development but it makes up for it in atmosphere and plot."
5,Awesome sequel to a prequel!,"If you thought that Peter and the Starcatchers was an awesome book, get ready, its sequel is just as awesome if not better! I do not want to say much about the book (so that you can read it on your own), but I love how it brings in characters new and old. A real page turner!"
4,New York Times Essential Library of Classical Music,"This book tries to cover too much. The author, who I must admit recommends recordings that I totally agree with, tries to cover both symphonic and chamber music in a single volume. Some essential music that I would have included, e.g. Beethoven Piano Concerti, are not reviewed. What is reviewed must be taken seriously by any classical music record collector. The author definitely looked at the recorded history of each selection he investigates and informs his readers of alternative recordings. This book will be great fun for lovers of classical music in general and record collectors in particular. I compliment the author for his inclusion on older records that have been beautifully remastered for CD. This is especially useful for collectors that are of younger generation, i.e., under 40.Ross Scimeca"
5,thought provoking,"Professor Sinha, delivers an interseting look on the USA and China, the history, current and future aspects are well supported and a general basis for economic and military power are explained for me as a lay reader. The implications are huge both on economics and on the military but also affect concerns on terrorism and anger at America, not as a country and its people but at it's politics and therefore the politicians. The Chinese communists are also equally criticised and this fairness by the author is important. Whether you will agree with this or not this book at the very least makes a case for the mutual paranoia and how psychotic it is."
1,Not A Good Read For Students of Sociology,"As a student of sociology, I'd recommend reading Anthony Giddens' works rather reading this trivial rubbish. In fact, you're better off reading Time Magazine or for that matter, MAD magazine."
5,Thermophore Heating Pad Review,This is the ONLY heating pad we tried that actually got hot. The cheaper store brands were junk and we returned them all. The quality and performance of this heating pad is awesome.
3,Instructions were extremely poor,Instructions were very confusing. It's not as good as the old one that I replaced. I'm not happy with the level of moisture and am having trouble adjusting the temperature.
1,Doesn't work,"The one I got must be defective - doesn't get hot. I know how to follow the instructions, it just doesn't work and I'm sending back."
3,It's not as good as I expected/wanted,"I have had few sports/accidental injuries in past few years and my hand therapist suggested this to me for my thumb after a surgery. I also use if or my recent shoulder & foot injury (more like a sprain). It's supposed to produce moist heat which I felt only for first few days. Since then, it does get HOT but its dry HEAT only. Is it a LEMON? Don't know.. Also, ridiculous that you can't actually control temperature except pausing it, which isn't great for temperature control. The auto shut-off feature is good. I am using it for now but may contact Seller or Amazon. It's just not what I expected, kinda disappointed!!"
3,It does get hot!!!,"Great pad overall if you want one that gets REALLY hot! But it seems crazy to me that there is no adjustment to the temp and a bit annoying that it shuts off automatically after 20 minutes. I suppose that can be a good and bad aspect to it. The outer case is nice, soft and seems very durable. I've had it several months and use it periodically but I only use this one when I need super heat, super fast. But for just a little pain relief I pull out my old Sunbeam pad."
1,Hate it,"I just bought this program after having versions 3-8 and it sucks! I will compare to 8 for its the most recent. It is nothing like 8, you cant change dimensions easily for starters.. I started drawing and couldnt even find where the cabinets are... it is very hard to navigate. Now maybe I am just dumb, but i have been drawing houses for fun for over 10 years and i just think this version sucks. If you are looking for something similar to the other versions, do not buy this! If you want something new... go ahead. Another little detail.. it wont import plans from old versions!"
1,wanted something as good as Broderbund but this was not it,"In 1990, I had a Broderbund software program that was perfect and this is not an equal replacement. This is just far too difficult to use and even get started. The Broderbund program really spoiled me and they quit making it, so sad."
1,Didn't make it one trip,Did'nt last 1 trip totally shattered I'm still looking for a good lock but this one is not it Thanks
5,Secure,"Like heavier, travel companions on tour saw them and wanted to buy my one extra, great for locking case in room, just another level of feeling secure and not worring about were are the keys - I am great for putting keys down some were"
3,Hmm,"A multi-century history of Mennonites, specifically Wiebes. What is the theme? What is sweeter than all the world? Familial love? He's not an easy man to read, but I enjoyed this one because of the history. Have to get hardcovers for my children before they're hard to find."
4,The Sounds are crazy,"The reason why Hypnotize Minds is one of my favorite artists is because they don't go pop like many other artist. They stick to one formula and roll with it nomatter what. This is the same thing with La Chat. I have found out that when HP sticks to the script, thier sounds get better and better with each album. MSP is an example of how a rap should be done....NON SELL OUT, NON BOUNCE, NON POP. My favorites are ""You AIn't Mad Ain't Ya"" , and ""Peanut Butter"" MASTER P and some other artist could learn to stay in the game from HP for real. OUT"
4,ILOVEWOMENRAPPERS,"Like the title of my review, I love female rappers. Everyone from Conscious Daughters to Foxy Brown, etc just to name a few.La Chat is raw. She is straight gangsta. She is not one of those pretty female artists. I love it!! Also...check out Gangsta Boo - Both Worlds, *69."
5,Classic..,I think this La Chat album was definately a classic and I think she definately sounds better than most other female artist along with Gangsta Boo. This is a must have album. Hopefully her new one in 2004 is as good as this one that one is a must have also....
1,what the he**,what th he** is wrong with 36 mafia i know there upsetthat gangsta boo left but they didn't have to get thisugly bit** to rap -its bad enough she sounds like gangstaboo -but this cd sounds old -i hope dj paul isn't runingout of material because all these beats are old and iheard slob on my cat on about 6 of there cd's-i guess that'swhy the source gave her 2 mics
4,Excellent Synopsis and Handling of a Critical a Subject,"This is an excellent booklet in order to set your heart at rest in Christ or set your heart right on Christ, whichever the case may be. No one author could fully set out a comprehensive examination of how an individual can ascertain the status of their soul and this booklet doesn't attempt to. Comprising a number of authors this booklet is able to touch the varying places a person may be at in their spiritual and personal journey of faith. Easy believism is addressed and handled biblically and without compromise. A works based salvation is shown for the rumble that it is and affront to the grace and work of Christ.If you're wondering about, or doubting, the work of God in you through Christ find and buy this short book. If you work with, counsel those, who are dealing with doubt - buy this booklet. If you are a Christian, a time will come when a book like this will be an excellent and swift read toward the rest and joy that is our strength."
5,Great Books!,"My 18 month old and I love these books, I actually had gotten First 100 words when she was a year old and within a few months she could either tell us what a picture was or if we asked she knew almost every picture. This is a great learning book and actually these four books would have been a great place to start! I highly recommend the first words books and this four pack set!"
3,"Book content fine, it's the mildew.....","I haven't been able to study from this book for any extended amount of time, due to the fact that it arrived with quite a bit of mildew odor. One wonders if it was sitting around in a basement since the publication date. I recommend looking for a used version of this book, preferably one stored in a dry area."
1,What tunes?,"Watched 20 minutes and said to hell with it. Maybe it got better, I'll never know. Production was fine. So what. I didn't hear anything I would call a melody. Love Tchaikovsky's symphonies (4,5,6) and ballets and VC and 1st PC. Great tunes. Really didn't expect tunes - never yet ran across an operatic composer (no, not even Rossini, don't like his operas either) who could write orchestral music or vice verse. Was talked into buying it. Bleah!"
1,For the Trashbin,"I can't imagine anyone ever wanting to see this production a second time. Send it back to Russia! They should be ashamed , putting this on DVD! Have you ever seen an opera soprano pull out the score book to read her part ? That's what this Joan does towards the last section. The staging is very static, most people just stand there, although Joan's father is vigorous, and they did hire a choreographer apparently for a minute or two of a battle scene. The chorus looks like a church choir in red robes singing from their score books, on stage, right next to the main actors, incongruous and intrusive. Why didn't they dress them up as peasants? I seriously object to Tchaikovsky's portrayal of Joan as a wavering, doubt-ridden Hamlet -- Hamlet Joan, with a lover. The music meant nothing to me, an amateur."
4,Forget Meyerbeer,"They say this opus is an old fashion Grand Opera , a never matching Pique Dame or Yevgeni Onegin by the same Tchaikovsky. That is true in my opinion.I ll not judge interpretation (average in good shape) due to almost lack of comparision. Nevertheless , the opera has more musical substance than whole Meyerbeer ""oeuvre"". Preventing likely reactions by Meyerbeer s addicts, I do not pretend, I loathe him. This Tchaikovsky opera is among his 4 best, meaning Onegin, Dame of Spades, Yolanthe and Maid of orleans.Flavio J MorschSanta Cruz do Sul, Brazil"
2,not a great production,"The music's great of course, and the director, the orchestra and the singers are at their best. The production on the whole, however, is ruined by a totally unexplicable mixture of different centuries, represented by the chorus in ridiculous 19th century outfits. The angels look as if they had just been dragged out of an elementary school play. It's not clear, how such an outstanding stage director as Boris Pokrovsky could come up with this immature performance."
2,predictable ending,Readable novel about four cobras at loose in a high rise; predictable ending. Worth reading if you have a few hours to kill in an airport.
2,"Great when works, but VERY poor quality!","These blacklights do output a good deal of UV once they warm up (5-10 minutes) and are quite effective, as well as good bang for the buck. However, of the 3 units that were shipped, 2 of them were defective -- one unit had a faulty lamp, and the other had a nonfunctional ballast. These are pretty simple units, so it's a shame that the quality is so low they are dead on arrival. There was no sign of unusually rough shipping/handling, but maybe they need to beef up the packaging materials. Props to Amazon for offering to cross ship replacement units at no charge, but ended up settling on keeping the one working unit and taking a refund on the broken one."
4,High output amazing lights,"Purchase 2 of these from PSSL.com - Highly recommended they shipped promptly and packed well.This is key to note - These are 400 Watt Mercury Vapor UV fixtures and are very similar to those used in gyms with white lamps.They take 5-10 minutes to turn on and the lamps are very fragile. These lights are designed to be used for permanent or semi permanent installs even though the build suggests that they can be relatively portable.I found that storage and transport face down is the best way to prevent any damage to the lamps and it is highly recommended that these are stored in padded road cases or padded bags, again face (grill) down.I've gotten a few years of use out of the original lamps before having to replace them. Output is 1st rate and we have used these with dual 48"" Fluorescent fixtures for side fills.2 of these will cover a full size gym or outdoor venue."
5,METALLLLLLLLL,"AWESOME AS HELL, great breakdowns, sounds like Sepultura old stuff with Max, Homo Iratus is a great band its too bad that not that many people know about them, wish they would come out with some new stuff"
3,"Some good, some bad",Song #3 and #4 recordings have a lot of hiss and noise. But none the less most of these are good yodeling songs. Could have left off the Tarzan yodel at the end.
1,A big joke,uhh yeah well this doesnt work let me tell you we went through the whole bottle and thats just 8 pills and nothing! i tried contacting the company but of course i dont think they even have one place to do that so let me tell you not to but this stuff unless you want to waste your money
1,It doesnt work,"I try this product but doesnt work, i think because it was the first pill but i use the whole bottle (8 pills) and nothing.waste of money."
3,Enjoyable family movie,Edward Asner portrays the patriarch of a family who gets word that theremains of his son lost in the Vietnam War may be found. He gathers hissons and grandson and they go on an archaeological dig. Robin Thomas isespecially fine as the brother who came home from the war a hero and Richard Cox is very good as the brother who fled to Canada rather thanserve Adam Brody is Thomas' son. This is a nice movie from an independentfilm maker. The cast probbly did it as a labor of love. I don't rememeberit ever playing in a movie theater in the Chicago area. Thanks to homevideo it can be seen.
2,OUTDATED DIETARY INFO,"THIS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED IN 1987 BY A EUROPEAN GENTLEMAN, WHOSE DIETARY AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF THE GREY MAY NOT BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL TO TODAY'S AMERICAN AUDIENCE."
5,Not your usual Hiaasen!,"Written in the 80's, this book is truly about ""a death in China."" There are none of the mad-camp crazy characters of his later fiction, but I was not disappointed. It was different... but well written. Having just returned from China myself, it provided a historical contrast to the China I saw today. Well worth the read!"
2,Very predictable; should have done more with such a promising topic,"The author really should have done more with such a promising topic. He turned a book about secret, hidden ancient treasures and spies into a script for a 1980's Chuck Norris movie. What a waste. I expected so much more from a story with so much potential. There were plenty of inconsistencies, too. One minute the central character is a badass former special ops hero, beating up two chinese henchmen, and the next he's a helpless victim of an aged grandfather. Really? It was hard to believe. I did enjoy the backdrop. It was a fascinating look into the politics and failures of communist China."
3,Eh...,"I've read a number of books since this one, so my recollection is a bit fuzzy. That may be telling...it's certainly not a memorable novel. Implausible and artificial circumstances, OK writing style, add up to an unremarkable book. Worth maybe $1-$2."
2,Unmemorable,"Hiassen fans will be disappointed. This book has none of the characteristic twisted, insane humor of most of his work. In fact, it is a rather formulaic spy/action/thriller book. If it were a movie, it would star Jean-Claude VanDamme. This is not to say that it is a bad book, per say, but it is very predictable. It has all of the usual elements, and though it does have some interesting bits here and there, it is ultimately just another predictable spy/action/thriller book."
2,Not Recommended,"This story is not among Hiaasen's best, or even his mediocre works. The storyline is improbable and the main characters are uninspired and forgettable. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Not his usual,"This book was an okay thriller type book. Nothing extra. Not like his usual funny, well written books. Kind of felt like a new author trying to find his voice."
4,A different Hiaasen,This mystery is well written and full of twists. The imagery is sparkling and you get into the plot quicly. A time well spent away from the TV.
4,Artists Sketchbook,"This a well-round art technique and media book for any artist level. I have over 300 art tecnnique books. I considered this book exceptional. I would have given 5 stars, but the printing is too small. If you can read the ingredients on a tube of toothpaste, you will be able to read it. I had to purchase a plastic square magnifying sheet."
3,"Small, tiny itsy bity cookie cutter","I bought this cookie cutter for a friend, and I guess I was being oblivious to the dimensions of it. But it's tiny, the picture makes it look so much bigger!"
5,Excellent Score!,Clearly written and completely comprehensive work of Gilbert and Sullivan's highly acclaimed Pirates of Penzance.
4,Not what you might think,WWhile in the military we hade these all the time one kind of gets used to it not for the beginner think ing eggs fresk they are not with a little cheese powdwe and some ketchup your on your way.
3,Additive Only unless you like bland,I tried this egg powder by itself and it was pretty bad but I then added it as filler during baking and it was fine. I used a bit in am omelet along with real eggs and you could hardly tell. I had to do a little testing to get the right mix.
3,Whole Egg Powder,I was disappointed in the amount that was in the bag. Too expensive for the amount. Haven't tried the product soI can not comment on the taste or quality of the product.
3,Not bad,"I like the product well enough. It mixes easily and is good to use in cooking. Not something I would eat just plain tho...pretty thin and tastes a little funny. The biggest inconvenience is the packaging. It is just a plain plastic bag, with no way to reseal once opened unless you have a heat sealer."
4,Conventient,"I have only used this product with pancake mix, but it works great for that. The mix I use is 1/3 cup per serving but calls for one egg per cup. This product works great to make a single serving and doesn't impart an ""off"" taste at all, in addition to being more convenient."
4,Sparky Pouch,"Good pouch, makes for good use of space and organization of tools. Wish it came with the shoulder strap as d-rings are provided for one, but the pouch only came with the belt not the strap as advertised."
5,Simply the Best....,"Love this ""Sparky"" Pouch. I am an electrician at a power plant and this pouch helps me keep my tools organized and always readily available. The material is very durable and strong and has held up in some rough environments."
5,Miss Sparky and Hubby love this pouch.,"I'm an amateur ""electrician"" (trained by my husband who is an unofficial pro), but with this pouch swingin' from my hip I'm like a wiring machine! (Ok, I admit it can still be slow-going with 12-2 wire in our cold climate). This pouch has plenty of slots for screwdrivers, wire-strippers, etc., with a nice blank space in the middle where you can carry supplies such as receptacles, covers and wire-nuts. The belt is easy to adjust, so it switches nicely from person to person, and is very heavy-duty--I like to put my cordless drill holster on it too so I can keep that at my fingertips as well. This wasn't something I would have thought I needed but now I am so glad my husband bought it for me, and he loves to use it too!"
4,"Almost perfect, except for...","Great tool bag! I'm really enjoying it, fixing things around the house. 2 things you need to know about: with your tape measure attached to the bag's metal holder clip, anytime you put the bag down, the tape measure gets knocked off - poor design. I have ended up clipping my tape measure to the top of the pocket above that. Also, be forewarned that this baby can hold a lot of stuff, and when you wear it while it's loaded, it can be pretty bulky and heavy. The belt is super heavy duty, and overall this is a great tool bag. It's well worth the money."
2,Charles Bukowski Tapes REVIEW,"I bought this DVD 6 months ago. AND I STILL HAVEN'T FINISHED WATCHING IT. Watch grass grow, watch paint dry. But to sit thru this DVD in one sitting... you will have to hide the knives in your kitchen from yourself. It has some cool footage, but in modern day times this movie is just too Terribly produced. You'll think that you could have edited the movie better yourself. Unless you want it as a collector, don't think for one second this is a GOOD FILM. Its NOT. I'm a fan of Bukowski's writing. And Bukowski Born Into This. This movie will make you wanna punch your drunk uncle."
5,Into Charles we go...,"Into Bukowski I went, and unlike any other Bukowski footage, I was able to leer into the person, the man, the human being beyond the author. I was able to see Bukowski in a light where I could call him ""Charles"" and feel a personable aura this documentary captured unlike most others.Charles Bukowski is often associated with an eccentrically-driven tough-guy kind of image, and he's tough, yeah, but he's tough in a complex way unbeknownst to most of the public.In this recording, Charles is ""Charles"" before he is singularly a world-famous author, ""Bukowski,"" and we are treated to an intimacy otherwise shelved away. Especially take note of the seen where he visits his old childhood home, recounting the abuse his father gave him; it's here that you see his sensitivity and humanity best: ""Let's forget it, okay,"" he says to the journalist, as he recounts his beatings in the old bathroom.Okay, maybe...but we won't forget you, Charles. Thank you for the gift of your literature."
4,Great ending to terrific trilogy,"This is an excellent finish to a really entertaining trilogy. Fans of fantasty fiction who have no prior exposure to the Dragonlance world can still enjoy these books (the first two are The Messenger and The Golden Orb).This book basically ends to tale of the characters introduced at the beginning of the trilogy. There are plenty of epic battles, narrow escapes, and character development. A couple of nagging questions (e.g. is Coraltop the kender real?) that are finally answered.The only qualm I have with this book is that the ending seems a bit rushed and a little too convenient. But it is not at all unbelievable, and the epilogue is very nice.Overall, a very good novel, but when taken in conjunction with the other parts of the trilogy, it is really excellent."
2,Avoid this trilogy,"While Winterheim gives the reader more suspense than the first book (The Messenger), I'd recommend avoiding this entire trilogy. I'll go a step further and advise fans of Dragonlance to ""test drive"" anything newly written by Douglas Niles before buying it. When fantasy writing lacks creativity, what's the point of reading it? And when an author starts producing works that are just plain badly written, how can you read them?"
1,Dented and seal doesn't seat well,"This came with a 2 inch wide dent near the bottom and affects the bottom - so it rocks. Plus, the plastic seal came off the first time I opened it. The metal is very thin, giving the impression that it is ""Made in China"" (cheap). Certainly I cannot give this as a Christmas gift, which I had intended."
1,poor quality,"I purchased this cannister as a gift, but didn't actually give it as a gift. The closure mechanism is poorly constructed... it bent the first time I tried latching it. The cannister itself is pretty nice, but to close it with such a poorly made latch is ridiculous. Returned immediately."
3,"Ordered two, but one was way better than the other one.",I ordered two of these in the same order. They were each in their own box. One was perfect and the other one has a stretched out gasket that has to be adjusted every time you need to close the canister and it is very annoying. Now I need to get a replacement gasket from the seller.
2,nice looking,"I purchased this container for compost. I figured the sealed top and easy flip top were perfect. Gasket fell off after about a month. No worry I tossed it. I love the fact the top is so easy to remove. It states its Stainless steel. It has rusted on my countertop, plus the whole inside is either rust marks or worse that i have tried to remove with a magic eraser, so as not to damage the finish further. Its a great looking piece. But will look for something else next time."
1,Cheaply Made,"This canister is huge! I truly wish it was made better, however. Very cheap and 'tinny' - I don't think it's going to last very long at all. It appears to be by the same people who make the 'Trudeau' canisters - again cheaply made(Trudeau 0871808 Stainless-Steel Food-Storage Canister, 30 Ounces). The first time that I closed the Oggi canister - I lined up the lid and the body and started to press the 'lock-lever' and I felt it bending. I really wasn't applying much pressure at all. I was VERY disappointed in the quality of item. I usually don't write reviews, but this product deserves the bad one that I gave."
4,"Very nice canisters, but need something on the bottom.","These are nice canisters, but we have granite countertops, so some anti-abrasive stuff on the bottom would be nice. I ended up gluing some craft felt onto them with rubber cement. Now they're perfect."
3,Mixed feelings about this Canister,"I recently started making bread everyday for my kids and needed additional containers for the different types of flour that I was using. I bought 2 of these (bread flour and whole wheat).What I like:This canister holds a 5 pound bag of flour with no issues at all.I like that you don't have to buy a whole set to get a large canister.I like that I can get the jar open with one hand - my other canisters require 2 hands and some force to open at times.What I don't like:The top is made out of plastic! I am not a big fan of plastic. I re-read the description and I guess that ""Clear flip-top lid"" means plastic.The ring that holds the locking mechanism just feels cheap and flimsy. It may be that it holds up to years of use but...The plastic top detracts from the appearance just enough to be annoying.I will probably replace these containers at some point because of the plastic top and the flimsy feel, but for now they serve a purpose."
1,need to buy a new one bcause this one seals so badly.,The seal of this container keeps falling off the cover into the flour both as soon as I open it and as I try to close it. Have not once had it seal correctly.
5,I love it!,"I love the great quality and the brushed stainless steel look. It matches my kitchen appliances. I own many of them in different sizes for storing rice, pasta, sugar, etc. I use the jumbo size to store flour. You should be careful to keep the flour away from the seal. It will keep it from staying in place; however, you can remedy this by simply removing the seal,(it easily detaches) putting it under warm water and patting it dry. If your careful this won't happen. I think the style outweighs this slight problem that may happen only when using it to store flour."
1,They don't last,"I bought two of these in 11/10. One was broken within a year, and the second one just broke. The problem is the closing clamp, which is cheaply made and comes apart easily, but is difficult to repair or put back together. I have other gasket/clamp type canisters that I don't have this problem with, but I bought this one bc of the size. Also the metal ring that is inset within the lid got rusty."
4,These are just what I needed,I have two of these setting on my counter. They are very handy and look nice. Would purchase these again and just might do it to hold other kitchen ingredients.
2,closing tab is flimsy,"I actually liked the plastic insert in the lid, as you can see the contents, and this was a nice storage container. 'Was' because the lock-down tab (or toggle?) for closing the lid failed after 3 months use."
4,good info/helpful,I found it helpful and inspirational. It was a good investment. I can't wait to get started. It will be fun.
3,Out of Date,"This book offers great instruction for beginners. My biggest complaint is that it only covers silver and gold; I believe it was published before copper and bronze were available in PMC form. Also, the terminology for the different types of clay does not match up with the clay I am finding through online vendors, so, being a beginner, it is difficult to know if the clay being discussed in the book is the exact same formula as the clay that is available through online vendors. That being said, I really like the projects that are outlined in the book, and I can't wait to replicate some of them. Bottom line, this is a good book, but needs to be supplemented with a more recent publication."
2,creative metal clay,"This book is full of great designs, however- I would not recommend this book for any self taught student. One can be self taught and not have to spend $300+ on a teacher telling you what you can learn on your own. Metal clay is NOT a hard product to learn. There are too many books on the market that read the same and have the same information on metal clay. My advise, free tutorials on the net are the best way to learn. Not only are the books on the market the same on metal clay, but do all of the authors have to word their instructions on every single move that their hands make? In conclusion, this book is good for the basics of metal clay and to make the designs in the book only. You can incorporta your own ideas after learning the way to execute a design. Purchase one or two great books on metal clay and leave it at that."
3,I'm not that impressed with the projects,"I just received this book today and I leafed through it and put it down. Normally with a book of this type (art instruction, projects etc) I'll just get lost in it and read it from cover to cover. I bought this book based on the reviews here and also that Ms. Wire is the head cheese at the PMC Guild, but if I had seen this book first in the store I probably wouldn't have purchased it. The jewelry projects are not my style at all, and the layout and photography isn't that exciting either.A better book about PMC is The Art of Metal Clay by Sherri Haab. I love the projects in there and the pictures are totally inspirational."
4,Biblical Aramaic Grammar,"Fairly clear grammar, though organization of the book is somewhat lacking. A better grammar is by Rosenthal, though I believe you can only get that book used. This is an okay book for a brief overview of the topic however a more detailed book, such as Rosenthal, will be needed for anyone hoping to progress in their understanding of the language."
5,Happy Customer!,"My 1 year old grandson loves this! He drives (pushes) it around, plays with the shapes, trys to fit the shapes into the truck, etc. I am a happy grandma!"
1,Not a good toy for small hands,"My son loves trucks and all things with wheels and played with this a bit when we first got it. However, the shape sorter spots are not huge, and he sticks his hands into them and gets them stuck. If I had any idea how to contact the company, I would suggest a recall would be warranted. Don't buy this toy - look for others where small hands are not put into jeopardy."
1,No OFF button!!!,"I bought this toy due to the good ratings from other customers. Warning: sometimes good ratings do not mean the toy is any good. Turns out, this toy has NO OFF switch. There is only one function and that is to be ON all the time. I like how it makes noises every time you stick a shape in its hole or press a button, but it's completely annoying that I cannot turn off the thing and have my baby play quietly. Sometimes quiet play is needed but this toy does NOT allow that."
5,Great gift,My 1 year old nephew loves this truck! He did not even want to stop playing with it long enough to let us take it out of the box.
4,Great toy!,"This is just as cute and fun in person as it appears in the picture. The little characters change between shapes and animals and makes for lots of fun for little hands. The only drawback would be that it only has one setting for sound and boy does it make noise. Every element of this little truck make noise, including when you put the shapes in their slots."
3,Cheap pieces,"My 13 month old loves this truck, but unfortunately the shapes aren't sturdy enough for child play. We have had this toy a month and already one of the shapes is jammed open/broken. Should be more durable given the audience (1-3 year olds!)"
3,Life is pants?,"I was a little disappointed in the book. I had read the reviews but found it wasn't very funny - more like depressing, with scenes of what I regard as emotional and physical abuse. I would have liked a happier ending!"
1,This book is Pants,I read the first chapter free on my kindle. I thought it was going to be funny. Nope. Instead the book had no character development at all. The author used the same phrases over and over to describe everything. I wish I could get my money back. The overall story read like the main character was 12 not in her early 30's. There was no plot at all. Avoid this book at all costs. In fact avoid this author until she takes a few writing classes.
5,Trendy cap,Very good service.The cap is beautiful and it was given as a gift to a a cousin in another country.He loved it!!!Thanks
1,Poor quality,"This yeast does not work well at all. I don't know if I just got a bad batch or what, but it is very weak compared to other yeasts I've used, and left me with flat, misshapen loaves. Never again!"
5,time saver,This yeast saves me a lot of time and my bread comes out as good or better than when I used yeast that needed proofing. I made bread for 60 years and wish I had tried this product a lot sooner!
5,Save money by baking delicious bread!,"When I got a new bread machine I thought I would go bankrupt buying yeast at my local grocery store. Fortunately I discovered this product. I got one 1oz ""brick"" three months ago and I have been baking approximately 2 loaves of bread a week. I estimate that it will take me another year to go through this one. And for $10 - what a steal!I haven't noticed any difference whatsoever in results between this product, fleishmann or red star. And you will just need 50% of the amount given in recipes.Great product!"
4,Buyer beware,"SAF Yeast is great. I only gave it 4 stars to draw attention to how I ended up massively overpaying for it. I do recommend dividing it up into 2 or 4 oz. portions and vacuum packing and freezing them. They will remain active and you can use all of the product.I have found it for sale at the Anderson's Chain in Ohio for $5/lb. I had forgotten they sold it.I got burned when I didn't carefully track the amount of ""eligible"" Amazon free shipping items, and got hit with a $8 shipping charge. At least we all know how Amazon pays for the ""free shipping,"" yes?Live and learn."
4,Quality yeast,I've been using it for a couple of months to make homemade bread and it has worked great. Have kept it in an airtight container in the freezer and has continued to work as advertised.
5,Good Yeast,"The product stores well, and has excellent performance. Easily added to the dry ingredients, no need to bloom."
1,Not pure yeast,"I was looking for yeast with no added ingredients, and this is not it...Ingredients: Yeast, sorbitan monostearate, ascorbic acidIt also came hot off the UPS truck, and I hesitate to open it for fear it is activated and dead. Will return instead.Not what I was looking for, won't purchase again."
1,Expensive,I have no doubt that it's very good. But I bought the same package at GFS Foods for three bucks!
1,Absolute WORST instant yeast I have EVER used.,"I have tried nearly a dozen times to make rolls, bread, etc., with this yeast. I have adjusted method and recipe, STILL, the end result is VERY DISAPPOINTING.Tossed 3 loaves of bread yesterday - one pan of rolls today.Cannot afford the loss!"
5,Thoughts from a seminarian: Useful tools for stimulating discussion,"Catholics are often accused of two things, not knowing the Bible, and being an unbiblical religion. While the first part may sadly be true in many instances (though nowadays that tide is turning), the second part is not, and this book sets out to bolster the position that in fact all of Catholic belief and practice is grounded in scripture, or at least flows from scripture.Armstrong lays out clear explanations of how various Catholic beliefs are not only found in scripture, but are strongly supported by it. His writing is clear and his arguments are strong. There was only one verse that I thought felt like he was fishing, but other than that I think it flows nicely.I think slinging Bible verses back and forth is a poor way to discuss religion, but at least this book should stimulate conversation, and help people, both Catholic and not to understand why Catholics believe many of those things that we do."
2,Not exactly respectful,"I have read a number of texts that contain support of Catholic doctrine found in the Bible. Therefore, I was interested in this particular book since the reviews suggested that it was clear, entertaining, and respectful. I'm afraid that while clear, it was neither entertaining nor respectful. The tone was condescending and unfortunately far too similar to what I see on sites that seek to REFUTE Catholic teachings with Scripture."
2,Disrespectful,"I received a copy of The Catholic Verses from Sophia Institute Press to review and I have to say that only within a few pages did I truly feel disappointed. Yet again, Mr. Armstrong seems to have a debate within the covers of this book about Catholics and Protestants and actually includes dialogue of his conversations. Not only did this offend me but also I thought this was unnecessary to be included in this book. For this reason I give this book 2 stars."
1,The Catholic verses....,"Never read this book and never will - the whole Bible was written by Jews, in the Hebrew language. The Catholics, and Protestants too, do not understand many Scriptures because they do not understand the Jewish meanings behind the words. When we all wake up to this profound Truth, then maybe we will all be one in Him."
5,biblical verses,Another excellent tool to help prove that the Catholic church is the Church established by Jesus Christ
5,good,due to a misunderstanding between the chipmunks and the birds its all out war in pixie hollow it is now up to beck to fix the problem this turned out to be a really good book
4,Beck and The Green Berry Battle,"A very good read for the personj it was bought for. She, my Grandaughter, was pleased with the book."
3,YO!!!!!! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! YO!!!!!!,"Anastasia takes the mail outside while walking her new dog. She picks up a ""New York Times"" newspaper bag and a pooper scooper just in case her new dog does you know what. She walks down a few streets, past houses, people waving and other stuff. Then she gets the idea of naming the dog Slueth because he sniffs lots of stuff like a detective. When she finaly gets to the mailbox she puts away the mail and walks away. When she got home she felt like something was wrong. She retraces her steps and then noticed that she put the newspaper bag of poop in the mailbox with the mail!!!"
1,Don't bother with this toy!,"In short, I have given two of these toys to my grandson and both quit working the SAME day. I traded out the batteries and the toy still didn't work. Perhaps there is a bulb inside that needs replacement but sure seems like a lot of trouble to have to fix the toy on the first day! My grandson is most disappointed as it, when it was working, was a cool toy for a little kid with a great light throughout the body and a vibration and little fan. Pretty expensive for a toy that only lasted hours though. After the first one, I gave the manufacturers the benefit of the doubt that I had gotten the one defective one but after giving the boy the second one and it doing the same thing (quitting completely!) I realize the toy is just junk. Darn it."
5,This thing is unreal.....,"I have two extremely aggressive chewers, a Lab and a Dalmatian....and this bone keeps them busy for DAYS. You do have to watch when the smaller top bones separate from the rest of the bone as they are chewed, they could be a choking hazard. The Sarge keeps both of my dogs interested, even when the marrow and tendons have long since been eaten. Great value for the price, considering they last so long. If you want a bone that stimulates and satisfies, this is it!"
5,Fantastic beginning of a new series!!,I am thrilled to recommend this book and all those that follow in the Springwater Series. Each one makes you anxious to pick the next to find out how the people in Springwater are doing. The mail-order bride concept of this time period has fascinated me. How did those women find the courage to go off into the vast unknown to meet a man that could very well be more trouble than they left behind. I can't wait to read Springwater Christmas that I just picked up in the store this weekend.
4,"Fast moving, easy read",I found this book to be very entertaining. It was a fast and easy read. The characters blended well together and the love interest was deep and with morals.
5,The first book in a series you won't be able to put down.,This book keeps your attention from front to back. Ms. Miller truly makes you feel a part of Spring Water and the building of this town. This book makes you feel good to read it. Very entertaining..I love reading about previous characters as their lives build beyond their book. I'm looking forward to the second book in this Wonderful Series..and the other four to follow.
2,It was just an OK,"The story premise was OK, but the book should have been just a short story like the rest of the series. I skimmed at least 1/3 of the book. There was too much ""I want to touch, can't touch"" ""I want to speak, can't speak."" That was the middle 1/3 of the book. Abigail's fever tried to slow me down a little, but I wanted to just get to the end & see how it worked out."
1,Extremely disapointing,"This book just never got going. There was no spark between the main characters, they could have been anyone. I have read all of Millers' earlier books and I really feel that this one doesn't even come close to the rest."
1,"Less Focus on Romance, more focus on the mundane","I do declare this is probably one of the worst books I've ever read. It's so boring I couldn't even finish it, and it's short in comparison to some other novels. I never even got the feeling that Evangeline and Scully were atracted to each other. They were just suddenly in love. But what bothered me the most was that every two pages some is either using the chamber pot, or the outhouse, or needs to ""twiddle"" as it was put. I've never read a romance that took such interest in bodily functions."
2,I couldn't ever really get into this...,"I had to watch this movie to write a paper about it for my music course. We had to watch a few other musical productions like South Pacific, King Creol, Les Miserables, The Magic Flute, etc., and this was my least favorite of the bunchI'm not sure if I didn't like it because of *this* particular production or if I didn't like the musical in general. I just could not really get into the work. I really enjoyed A Little Night Music, so I don't think it's the fault of Sondheim. It's probably a tremendous piece if it can be experienced the right way."
4,Good for commecial interior designers,"The most helpful aspects of this book is it's solutions for designing for disabled people in the workplace. Since the ADA was established in 1992, accomodating the needs of the disabled is now a requirement for all newly designed spaces. This book helps interior designers not only accomodate these needs, but tries to provide ideas for solving the design problem creatively. The end result is an aesthetically pleasing work environment rather than one where ADA accessibility has been treated as an afterthought."
4,Whose Back Is Bumpy? - Textured Soft Shapes,"My daughter like this one, but not as much as high tide. I think it has to do with the colors. High tide is much more colorful where this one is kind of drab."
3,interesting history,"Our book club chose to read this as we are in Phoenix and it's part of our history. The actual history of the area is very interesting, especially for a transplant such as myself, but Bommersbach is definitely a journalist, and the book reads like a long news article. My husband didn't like the choppy style either. It was worth the read as a piece of history, and the price (1 cent) couldn't be beat!"
4,Second-time purchaser,"I really like this face cream. My skin has a soft, silky feel after I use it and I think it's even helped my frown line. The travel size is so handy to pack in a purse. Overall, I like Cliniques products very much and they are nice people to do business with. Thank you!"
1,Disgraceful,"The reproduction of these rolls is clattery, spasmodic -- altogether a disservice to Paderewski's memory. Stick with the flat disc recordings (acoustical and electrical) or go to the Pianola Institute website for good recordings of the later Duo-Art rolls."
2,"Interesting, but...","I found this to be a very tedious read. It was apparently well researched, but the writing seemed to be just to be trying to tie the often redundant newspaper and magazine articles together. I found myself reading a paragraph and finding the same quote was in the previous paragraph. The book is in serious need of an editor.While I have much more information on Pete, I don't feel I know him any better after reading this book."
2,Not so amazing compilation,"After reading previous reviews, I elected to order this paperback.My anticipation was for a more complete and accurate book than Giuluano's ""Behind Blue Eyes"".I was wrong, as there is little new information and insight into Townshend. What this book does contain are plenty of typos and too much reliance on outside reviews and articles. This is not so much a biography by Wilkerson, as it is of a collection of concert reviews and previously published articles with a large perentage of the material coming from ""The Who Concert File"".In fact, do yourself a favor and save the $34 bucks (expensive for a paperback) and purchase ""The Who Concert File"" or continue to wait for the real thing from Townshend."
4,Porcupinish,Good moody music. Not enough hard riffs for my taste but still a very good CD. Similar to Porcupine Tree.
3,NONE of the lyrics RHYME!,"Like the music, but none of the lyrics rhyme. And I mean none. It took me a little while to notice this - I was trying to figure out what was wrong with these songs - why they didn't sound right. Sure, the story is depressing, and I like the notes chosen for the lyrics - the music flows nice - but it's like he is reading the lyrics from a book to tell a story. Real annoying, at least for me is it. Are the other albums like this? If not, they I might be interested in exploring more of this band, but this one gets skipped on my playlist."
2,Needed a better editor,What a disappointment that this book did not have a better editor writing the introductions to the pieces. It could have been greatly improved by having an expert in Mitchell write about her instead of Eskridge. What was the editor thinking?
2,Reinventing Shakespeare,"This book on Shakespeare is the obvious result of a lot research from an author who knows his subject as well as anyone. Yet it is a disappointing book as Taylor seems to get lost in endless erudite arguments about Shakespeare. The book needs far more context than supplied here to explain to the reader what is occurring.The general problem with the reputational school is that hey seem to think that the debate caused by the work, is more important than the work itself. In the end, the quality of Shakespeare's writing and ideas are what continues to encourage study.I am not convinced by the central argument that Shakespeare's reputation is not fully deserved."
5,It's my favorite,"Switched to this after trying lots of stuff. Comparable to Hoppe's in terms of being a good solvent, however Gun Treatment doesn't smell bad, it can be sprayed on (instead of Hoppe's, which comes in a wide mouth jar), it is fairly thick, so when you spray it inside the barrel it holds where you sprayed it, and it's a decent lubricant after being wiped off. Use it almost exclusively now, I only use Hoppe's when I have to soak a barrel in one of the jars."
3,Disappointing,"I own several Raikes bears circa 1980 and 90. I purchased this book to see what the value of my bears could be. Found ONE of my bears. Not a very complete book on all of his works, especially the mass produced ones in the 80's and 90's."
5,I agree--best ST album and last good one,"I love this disk,I am a huge fan and like all there stuff up to this cd.after that it went pretty down hill.every song grabs you from start to end.a lot of people did not think it was hard enough,but it is and it has some real musical substance.i say buy it you wont be sorry. I would give more stars if I could."
5,Best ST album,Great guitar work on this one Rocky George is amazing guitarist really underated so is mike clark and Robert is a great bass player And mike with those lyrics good if you are in a depressing mood overall good album listen to it your in for a treat must have for ture metal fans.
4,Suicidal Tendencies,"Pretty good CD by the Punk-Skate rockers. I like their earlier CDs, but this one is a good buy, too."
2,Disappointing,"I'm really sad and sory to rate this album 2 stars because I am a big ST fan. This is probably their worst one. It has like one good song. Nobody Hears. That's their best song on here. I'm am really sorry to say that I want my money back but I can't get it. Oh well. The music on this CD is strange and isn't like ST Punk Rock. And Mike's voice! I hate it! I thought this would be a great album. But it isn't. If you are looking for Mike's original voice and their punk rock and all of that hard stuff and not this girly voice with mellow music, don't buy this! Get something like Freedumb (see my review by Aaron) or another one. Just disappointing....."
1,Worst ST album EVER,"This album is complete filler. There is not even a single worthwhile song to be floated by another 9 tracks of filler. It is 100% tripe. It is odd how a band that was so powerful in it's genesis would cash in and sell out to the weakest level. Lights Camera was garbage too, but at least ST fans could pretend to like it. This one leaves no room for imagination. The fact that any one related to Queensryche had anything to do with this album is a big STAY CLEAR SIGN. This one isn't even worth the time it has taken you to read this review."
3,Has some issues,"This system had all the features I needed for my small room... on paper, but I had several issues with it.The main issue was that you can select A or B speakers but not A AND B. I use A for surround and listening in the local room, while B goes to speakers in several other room. Every other Amp I have used, had that capability.Different audio sources typically have different volume levels, but the tuner on this unit was significantly louder than other sources.The volume on this unit reads out in Decibels, which is fine except 0 was too high and the unit was always in the negative range. This bothered my wife more than me, but again it was different than the other amps I have used.Somehow it automatically preset a bunch of garbage stations, and there did not seem to be any way to delete a preset.I found the instructions vague and incomplete and the remote layout not the best"
1,Fluffy and Pointless,"To get right to the point, I thought this video was a complete waste of time. It was only half an hour long, but there wasn't any real plot. Character development was little to nonexistent. The English translation and grammar was laughable in each of the character profiles which are shown when each character is introduced. (Hello? Anyone think to run this through a spell-checker before releasing it?) After watching it, I couldn't even recall any of the characters' names because of the lack of plot/character development. It was just a bunch of girls running around and... that's pretty much all that's to it. I suggest you spend your money on a more worthwhile anime."
4,Sturdy but need improvement on swivel clip,"This perticular Armor Case is finally a one that fits perfectly to T-mobile HTC HD2 (US version). The body is really sturdy and has Neoprene inner lining for extra protection and shock absorbing. Has easy access to all buttons and almost all touch screen areas (except the top right corner, a little difficult to access. could use a little more offset) But the most important flaw in this design is that the swivel clip doesnt hold its position. Once the phone is on the clip, it can rotate freely which is little odd, little attention to the detail would have been better. Other than that along with a good screen protector its a good product."
2,its ok for temp. use..,bought it for my htc hd2..good idea but latch and hinge does not feel very secure..thought it would be ok for temporary use.. i was waiting for the otterbox defender series bulky but very very secure..
2,Lose signal most of the time,"design look not so bad, and it really will protect your phone from any kind of dropping, but unfortunately your phone will lose signal most of the time. I have been using it for 1 month and just found out that issue now because when i put it on my hand the signal just lose haft of it. so don't buy it. still looking for a good case, i am going to try the evo plastic case maybe it will fit and be ok."
2,Good fit but...,"It fits the U.S. version of the HTC HD2 perfect, unfortunately (for me at least) when I would place the phone in the case, it would cut my phone, edge and 3g connectivity to nothing or almost nothing. I'm sure it would protect the phone, but if i can't use the it while it's inside, it's pretty pointless. I'm asking for a RMA to return it now."
4,RN,"Some good stories here. Really liked the one on Kelly, If your interested in JTR, I think you will find some interesting reading. Not a masterpiece, but its hard to come out with 4 of these 120 pages book form a year. They have done well. A good solid 4 stars."
5,I see you...,"Great Binoculars for the price. These Barska binoculars are very powerful, with adjustable distances. I use them at the an open air rang to verify my shots so I don't have to wait until it's safe to walk out and verify it in person."
4,great binoculars,"Great view and zooms really great.Only draw back is they are a little heavy, if you plan on walking around with these, you might consider the weight issue."
1,"Horrible, useless binocs!","Wasnt expecting much for some cheap binoculars but this thing is just plain useless! The mirrors werent aligned right so from 10x to 30x zoom, I was seeing two pictures! Try looking at something crosseyed and you'll get the picture... Yes, I definitely will return them."
4,Great for the price,For the price it does what I need. The zoom feature is convenient to some extent but at full zoom it's hard to see the subject. Not as clear as a high end glass but for what I use it is completely satisfying. I recommend it.
3,Zoom is nice,We got these to replace an inexpensive pair of non zooming binoculars.We use them mainly for bird watching.The zoom feature is nice and easy to operate (the focus has a bit much dead band).It is nice to be able to find your object first and then zoom(it is hard to find an object at full power).The only complaint is the view is not as crisp as we would like.
2,binocular,"I don't like the yellow colored on the lens. I have to refocus every time I zoom in for closeup. I'd like to return the Barska 10-30x50....I'm not happy with it.Barska 10-30x50 Zoom,GladiatorBinocular"
3,"Its ok, only ok","These work but their very hard to use, they have very low eye relief so you have to squeeze your face into em, also it doesnt have an easy way to mount it to a tripod, i would have like to seen a bottom hole rather than one on the end that i had to fabricate a holder for"
1,Terrible even for Price,"The first pair had terrible alignment and produced a double image at any zoom. They were also missing pieces and the rubber was peeling off the case. They also had glass bubbles in one lens.The second pair would not focus beyond ~26x zoom, had a smudge internally to one lens (each pair having 50% perfect lenses!), and the bag strap was sewn in a twist- like twisted 3 or more times, then sewn.Both pairs were too cheaply made even for the price, all the extras (strap, bag) were practically worthless. The lens caps would not stay on, but came off without the slightest provocation (sitting on chest, in or out of bag, setting them down- the slightest brush and off goes one or more caps!)Ocularly they were sub par, even ignoring all the flaws. Honestly, I wouldn't keep these if they were free."
2,out of focus when zoomed in,"No doubt someone tried to make an affordable pair of binoculars. These look good, feel good, but just don't perform. The image is small and dark, out of focus when zoomed in, and plagued by double vision."
5,Great product great price,"We have really enjoyed these binoculars. They have a great range on them, and we use them often to scope out deer and to plot hiking and climbing paths. They seem to be quite sturdy and of quality materials."
2,"Cheap price, cheap binocular","At 10-15, image is fairly clear. Anymore zoom than that and you have to close i eye, otherwise image appears cross-eyed."
1,a piece of junk,"it has nice orange coating butthe prism is cheap, field of view is very narrow as a roof prismthe zoom does NOT work, since it works only on one eye peice.so the image become double image.The focus works in one direction only, you cant get it to turn back in after extending focus using focus ringthe diopter setting is so far off you almost have to unscrew the eyepiece to align it."
4,A Good Bad Book,"I don't know how I started reading these books, but they are so much fun. I'm absolutely addicted to Laura van Wormer's stuff, and it's all because of Riverside Drive. The characters are fun and engrossing, and I appreciate the way the author continues to use the same protagonists to keep the reader addicted. West End was not as good as Riverside Drive, but still worth the effort."
1,"Beware, gerbils would eat this","Having kept gerbils for many years, I would recommend a glass aquarium with a secure lid as the safest (and usually cheapest)home for them. They can chew their way through plastic structures like this one faster than you might believe."
2,good product ?,"When I opened this product, the top of the jar had dried up from the lack of a protective film under the lid. I dug thru this layer and used it, but have no idea just how effective it will be. It may be a great product, but because of the packaging error don't know how well it will work. Unless the seller fixes the packaging I would not recomend this product to anyone !"
3,Swollen and Bleeding Cat Paws,"We purchased Protecta-Pad in an effort to try and relieve the swollen and bleeding paws on our tabby cat. It did help some, but after we took him to the Vet it turned out he has an allergy to mosquito bites which was the underlying cause for the problem with his paws. He was given a couple of shots which solved the problem."
5,Protecta Pad cream,A friend told me about this product and decided to buy it. It definitely helps my dog keeps its paws hydrated and protected.
3,I don't know...,"I bought this book for a class and didn't start reading it until recently because it was the last book on our schedule. I don't know if the seller knew this but there is a repeated section that leaves a big chunk of the continuation missing. Other than this mix-up, the price and service were pretty good."
3,Smoky book,This product was as stated however it was an older version and it SMELLED like smoke. I had a very hard time reading it because it smelled so bad.
1,LONG WINDED,"IF I KNEW IT WAS WRITTEN LIKE A TEXTBOOK, LONG WINDED, OVERLY DESCRIPTIVE, TIRESOMELY LONG, AND FULL OF FOREIGN VOCABULARY, THEN I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT LONGING FOR PLEASURABLE READING. IT TOOK ME NEARLY THREE WEEKS TO COMPLETE BECAUSE I READ FOR ENJOYMENT AND LONGING WAS AN ORDEAL. THE BIBLIOGRAPHY ALONE WAS A SHORT BOOK IN ITSELF. GRANTED THE AUTHOR WAS VERY THOROUGH IN THIS BIOGRAPHY, BUT IT WASN'T A NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDER OR A KATHERINE GRAHAM TYPE OF READ."
2,Pearls in Slime,"The author of this book can be thanked for sparking my interest in looking up Clara Wieck and Robert Schumann and finding out the real facts of their lives. The book itself treats important aspects of their lives with an ambiguous shimmer that shouldn't be acceptable when writing of historically real people.For music lovers, the details of Clara's playing technique, the quality of various pianos, the contemporary view of Schumann's work as avant-garde, are fascinating tidbits despite the prose through which they must struggle to find them.My own view of this process is of fishing pearls out of slime. The author's archly prurient style casts an unpleasant light over the whole story.To be more charitable (possibly) I quote from the author himself in answer to a question about the style: ""Maybe it's a bit of Henry James meets Thomas Mann, and the two of them go to bed with Edith Wharton."""
1,Not Schumannesque,"I wish this book possessed the Romantic genius of Robert Schumann's best music rather than collecting the literal facts of his life. A biography in the guise of fiction, complete with scholarly footnotes, all this books needs is an index - that, and a perfervid imagination. I wanted to enjoy Longing, but it was so slow and meandering, I only longed for it to be over. The minutiae of scholarship defeated me. There is invented dialogue amidst all the factual detail, but it does not transport, much less convince. If you want true fantasy, choose Schumann's Fantasy in C - Longing is far too literal."
5,Xbox 360 Pro Gamers Case,"This case is a must for Xbox 360 gamers that travel. Currently deployed to middle east and I was able to ship 3 games, 1 controller, the power brick, 4 packages of beef jerky, 3 packets of gum, 2 packages of dried cranberrys to me all in perfect condition. I highly recommend this item to anyone. 5 Stars!"
1,Latches broke after two days,This case is very cheaply made. One of the latches broke after using it only twice...the other did not seem far behind. I ordered a replacement from Amazon and the SAME THING happened again. I just sent it back for a refund and I'm glad to be rid of it. I found a much better quality case with more storage space at GameStop for $30 (it had a Gears of War design on the outside). Stay away from this thing.
3,I got what I paid for.,"I managed to fit the power source in it. But its real test will be when it flies over to California in January. I guess it will need the fragile sticker, or I'll bring it over as a carry on. It doesn't look that sturdy to me. As I said I got what I paid for."
2,Pro Gamers Case drops to minor league,"Looks nice and shiny. Good inner cushions and design. 'Just enough' to limited space. The thinness of the aluminum case, makes it fairly light, but provides minor league protection, and sturdiness. The frail single hinge on one side does not allow the case to open and shut by simply raising and lowering the top lid. I have to hold and adjust the hinge while closing to keep it from bending. I bought it with rewards points, so am not dissappointed, but probably would opt for something more strong and dependable if paying face value."
3,Game case,Case works great a little more room would be nice for switch or router for Sys-link gaming.
2,A little disappointed,"When I got this product, I was incredibly excited because I've been really worried about taking my system to college and it getting damaged along the way.This product made me worry even more because when it arrived, the interior was in pieces. Yes, pieces. Considering that the case was only thirty bucks, I guess I got what I paid for. While I would say that it probably happened in transit, I don't really know how the inside could have gotten so torn up unless it was poorly constructed in the first place..."
5,Can't beat it for the money...,"What can I say? I just traveled 600 miles by plane for a LAN party, and this case (as a carry-on) protected my system both there and back. I'm not sure why so many folks are complaining about its capacity-- I had plenty of room for the console, power brick and AC cable, component cables, a wireless controller, 4+ games and two spare batteries. Of the thirty or so folks who attended the LAN, most thought it was pretty slick (they REALLY thought it was slick when they found out it cost less than $30).Anyway, if you're looking for a slightly reenforced case for your Xbox and you intend on treating that case as if there were a fragile system inside of it (no case is truly going to guard against careless/ hard handling), this one should do nicely."
3,Power Adapter,There is no room for the power adapter.in my case i have the 360 3 games 2 wireless controllers remote control wireless adapter av hd cables.they didnt make room for the power adapter. on the front of the case it shows original xbox cables.
1,this case is worthless,the case CAN NOT hold the power supply. why this case won't hold the standard stuff the 360 comes with is stupid. DON'T BUY if you plan on traveling with your 360.
1,not appropriate for young children,"I am surprised that reviewers have not had an issue with the content in the section of the story where Anansi traps the fairy. I would not read this book aloud to my classes because of lines like ""...slap her spanking place"" and the fairies discussing hitting hard and hitting again to teach the wooden fairy a lesson! Dragging fairies, the snake, and even the hornets off to an angry god also does not convey appropriate social messages. Many other Anansi books are much more appropriate for teaching about these traditional stories - such as the ones by Eric Kimmel."
2,Ehhh,I like the older CSI Las Vegas better but wanted to try this one out. I ended up reselling it though. David Caruso is completely wrong for the part and I think he really overacts to the point of being ridiculous.
2,not really investigation,"The original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence. This series uses the CSI name without the investigating that makes the original so good. It is mainly a mellow-drama surrounding the lives of the characters. Some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor, but there's no mystery."
2,Not great,"We have alot of Vtech toys and love their nursery farm. We bought this because my husband liked the idea of a ""joystick toy"" and thought our son might too. Honestly, he is not really interested at all. When you press the buttons it saysthings like A is for Ape - but you are pressing a green triangle. It has a small pictures outline in white of an ape, but I am not sure it is clear enough to have any learning value for a child. Anyway, my son has never been interested in this toy and that's OK, as beyond cause and effect - which many other toys do a better job teaching - we find it has little value. Try the move and crawl ball for a 9+ month-old or nursery farm for 0-3yrs. There are just better options."
1,Not engaging,"For the price, I thought this would be a great buy, but my son hasn't really bothered with it, from 4 mos. on up to his age now, 15 months. The joystick was fun for a minute or two - it makes really cute noises and moves easily - but that was about it. This toy also has some buttons with shapes, etc., but they're not attention-grabbing, and there might be too much going on to help the little ones ""get it."" He's learned more from books, shape sorters, etc. Also, the ""left brain,"" ""right brain"" toy concept was intriguing, but in hindsight, it seems a little silly."
2,You get what you pay for,"The flag arrived quite quickly after I purchased it. Though it was inexpensive and my expectations were not high as far as the quality was concerned, the face of one of the figures (Prosperity) is so distorted that she seems to be winking. Worth the amount spent, but not sure I'd actually want to fly this version publicly. If you actually want to fly a NJ State Flag, you're better off purchasing a higher quality version without distortions and more accurate in its depictions."
1,"Misleading product description doesn't fit 52"" waist","Nice looking belt. Not a ghost of a chance it fits up to a 52"" waist. Not sure it would comfortably fit a 48"" waist without having to really tighten it down. The length of the belt is only about 53"" so there isn't anyway you can buckle it. The padding reduces the useable length of the belt as well since it adds to your waist size."
4,One problem with this belt,"This tool belt is a great buy. I'm a bigger guy and it fits me perfectly. The only problem that I have with is, the hammer loop. It isn't right for my hammer. My hammer is a .Stiletto TB15MC TiBone 15-Ounce Titanium Milled-Face Hammer(also a great buy). If your hammer has a rubber grip on it, you're going to have a little bit of a tough time inserting, and removing your hammer out of it. And it is fixed on the belt so you can't adjust it. But other than that, awesome belt, and the suspenders are really comfortable."
5,Husband approved!!,"My husband works in HVAC and he has gone through so many tool belts. We have to replace them every couple of months so we ordered this one because of the price. When we got it, it was way better than the advertise. It is really good quality and has lots of pockets for tools. We've paid over $100 for tool belts in the past and this one is by far the best on he has had. It's very comfortable too."
2,5 months later and ready for something else,"the suspenders were useless. I altered them and made them work. Then the clips that held them broke easily. Once again, my alterations made them work.3 weeks ago, I git sick of fighting the suspenders, and put a leather belt on it because the one that came with it was for big people.Now the velcro is failing.Great bag layout. Lots o pockets. lots of hassles, and dissapointments."
2,Not Much,"After searching for a tool belt through many makers I settled on this one..I wish I could go back,because I would have chosen a different one..I have been in construction for 40 years and the only good thing I can say about this apron is it dosen't hurt my waist.The people who design these things,,oh well..The straps are too long,,they want stay adjusted right,it is laid out good on the left side but the right kinda stinks,,the pencil holders are conceiled inside a bigger pocket,I don't have time to search for where my pencil goes everytime I use it..It is a very stiff manmade meterial,the hammer holder is in the back,hard to get to..Who designs these products,A 12 year old could do better...Wake up America"
3,mullet,i agree with other reviews;there was no hook which i had expected.and the suspenders are useless for not large sized people
4,Solid everyday nail bags,"I bought these bags about 5 years ago and wear them every day. I've put them through their paces and they've held up well, though the hammer loop did break last month..easily replaced for $10.I do alot of framing, and though these are big bags with lots of room, they lay flat which allows you to easily pass through 16"" spaces.The suspenders and padded waist belt are in fact useless, but the bags themselves are rock-solid."
2,almost good but some real short comings,I am a full time carpenter/framer. These bags seem well built and have lots of handy pockets. But the pencil holders really are pitiful. They are quite deep and don't hold the pencil very tightly. Before the pencil is half gone it disappears in the deep pockets. Also the utility knife holder is inside the pouches main pockets. Not to bad until your pouch is full of something. I used these bags for about 2 weeks til I got to aggravated and switched.
2,Not the best resource for Customer Service tips,"These tapes are a recording of a lecture given by the author. The examples he uses are unrealistic, and not good demonstrations of how people act. One example he uses is about an irate woman who is unhappy with paint touch-ups on her car, and in order to keep the woman happy, the auto-detailer offers to paints THE WHOLE CAR for free.On a positive note, though, he does show how to talk to people when they are irate (by using their name to calm them down), and by identifying the personality type and making suggestions of how to talk to them.The skills taught are useful, but the examples could be re-written."
5,Makes a St. Louis family history come to life!,"The Lemp family of St. Louis would have made Paris Hilton look boring. Deception, suicide, sex and a woman who had her own way of making a statement all come together to make this stranger-than-fiction family come to life. The information on the Lavender Lady is worth the price of the book! Excellant!"
5,What a wonderful collection,"I bought one piece (See amid the winter snow) then ended up purchasing the album to add to my Christmas music collection. Well mastered, it is beautiful music with a wide range of Christmas favorites. I even learned a few new ones that were really enjoyable such as the pieces done by the Mediaeval Baebes."
4,Very Good,I got this album because D. Hall was at the Philadelphia Memorial day concert here. And I also remembered how good they used to be back in the days when I saw them live here in Plilly. A lot of memorries. That is why I do not buy any of the current singers today. I think they do not have the talent that the old schoolers had.
3,Decent album from the disco era,"I am a child of the 1970's and was never a big fan of Hall & Oates. I bought this cd as a gift for my daughter. But as I listened to it, it brought back many great memories and some of the songs have improved in my old age. Who couldn't like ""Rich Girl""?"
4,Very good,This CD has a lot of the songs I remember from the '80s. It's a good collection of Hall & Oates songs.
1,Hall & Oates.,Di not receive the The very best of Hall and Oates. Happy with all the other products I received.DVD & Blueray
4,Very Best?,While the sound quality of the songs is great--it is still missing a few songs (example--She's Gone) to keep this from being the really 'very best' of Hall and Oates. Although the price I got it for made it a no brainer--you will still need a few more songs to get a complete collection of the very best.
3,Quality isn't great,"I've been wanting a Greatest Hits from Hall & Oates for some time but always found any version to be too expensive. I like them but not enough to spend a lot of money. Then this mp3 went on sale and I snatched it up. It has all of the songs that I can remember wanting from this group (as a casual fan versus a die-hard). But the quality isn't great. For each song, the first 2 seconds are silence, which gets annoying (I'll go in and have them all start at the later time but that will be a mundane task). And it sounds like it hasn't been remastered. Still, it's nice having these songs in my playlist now."
5,Comfort Food for the Ears,"It is complete submersion into throw back, retro, good memories, old school, get your party on, blue-eyed soul. And they're all full version. Perfect."
5,Always loved them,"These guys are a classic, you have to buy this for old times sake. I would recommend this to everyone."
3,"Good, but not complete! Get the Australian import instead!","Okay, RCA tried, (and failed once again), to release a definitive Hall and Oates ""Best of"" collection. I'll keep this review short: if you want the best compilation currently available, skip this one and look up the double-disc Australian import, ""Starting all Over Again; Best of Hall and Oates"", with a generous 36 songs, total. It contains 17 of the 18 tracks on this CD, (""Wait For Me"" is missing, but who really cares?), but also features the full-length 5 minute version of ""She's Gone"", plus tracks from their Arista releases and a couple of songs from Daryl Hall's solo ""3 Hearts"" album. It's a much better buy than the CD you're looking at right now."
2,2 stars for lousy sound quality,"I've seen this mentioned only in scattered reviews so I will bring it up again:This collection of greatest hits has a very tinny, downloaded mp3 kinda sound. I saw one reviewer describe the fact that it sounds like entire frequency ranges may be missing from the mastering. I agree, it sounds terrible, like something went wrong with the remastering process.This band deserves a real remaster job with some fullness and without the tinny digitalized sound quality. No wonder we're getting so many great songs for so little. I read that Essential H & O is just Ultimate H & O repackaged and Ultimate was plagued with the same poor 'remastering'. These three releases are all probably sourced from the same hack remaster job.I'm surprised this isn't mentioned in more reviews. I guess I will stick with my vinyl until something better comes along....."
4,Classic Hits by class singers,If you are a fan of the songs of Daryl Hall and John Oates this album gives you a greatest Hits compiliation. To some the Hall and Oates songs may seem outdated but it's nice to hear them and remember the good times.
3,What were they thinking???,"A Hall & Oates greatest hits compilation without ""She's Gone""???Are they high???"
2,The Frustration Continues,"When are we going to get a decent compilation for Hall and Oates??? When I noticed that ""She's Gone"" isn't even on here, I put it right back. It seems that every compilation that comes out for these guys comes up short. I think the answer to this problem is to just put out a box set, although, at this point I wouldn't be surprised if they screw that up to. I guess for now I stand in protest with my original ""Rock and Soul Pt 1"". Until something worthy comes along, we'll have to stick to individual LPs it looks like. I'm willing to wait - these guys were awesome."
2,Unhappy customer,"This listing claimed that the cd was brand new and never used. I recieved the cd with no plastic wrap and there was obvious wear and use with the case. The cd itself seemed okay with no scratches, but I don't appreciate the false advertisement."
4,Very nice,This CD is a great collection of Daryl Hall & John Oates music. I gave this to my mother-in-law for Christmas and it's all she listens to in her car now!
4,"If you liked this, try","This album is great, but if you really like this duo- get the import ""The Best of Hall and Oates"". I bought it here at Amazon - it was a little pricey - but was it worth it! ""Me & Mrs. Jones"", and their version of Marvin Gaye's classic ""What's Goin' On"". These song's are my most favorite by these guys!"
5,Hall and Oates,"This is a good CD as all their CD's are but I especially like it because, It's a Laugh is on it. That song isn't on all their greatest CD's."
2,DISSAPOINTING,"I bought the very best of Daryl Hall and John Oates as a Christmas present for my dad. Being the fact that it had 18 tracks and a eye catching price tag, I figured it'd be a great deal for the both of us. I guess I was wrong. The cd doesn't contain Hall and Oates' biggest hit, She's Gone. This is my dad's favorite song, and the fact that it's on the essential Hall and Oates, but not this one, is a scam so you'll buy the essential hits, the more expensive of the two, and not this. What a disappointment, it's not like all 18 tracks on here are very good. There's some that are pretty bad, like track 3 for instance. No offense to the fans who are going to say that this review isn't helpful."
3,Great CD but skips,"This was supposed to be a new cd, but it skips in a couple of places the first time I played it."
1,NOT WORTH TWO CENTS,"I am a casual fan of the duo. I started looking for a compilation of their greatest hits and came upon ""The Very Best Of Daryl Hall & John Oates"". I thought great. Then I started looking at the tracks for my all time favorite ""She's Gone"". It was no where to be found on this compiliation. What? Are you kidding me; no ""She's Gone"" on ""The Very Best of Daryl and John Oates"". That song is arguably their greatest hit. Omitting it from the collection is a major infraction. As such this compiliation is not worth two cents to me."
4,Hall And Oates - Yeah!,Hello - it was on sale for $3.99 - if you don't know what you are getting when you buy a greatest hits Album they are probably not Great Hits....
4,Hits,At under $2 this was worth it. Takes me back to my youth. I would recommend this product to others. Delivered as promised.
4,Brings me right back,"Maybe this will sound sappy but what the heck, I'm a hopeless romantic:I grew up listening to Hall and Oates and going to grammar and junior high school dances, slow dancing with my crushes to Hall and Oates 'One on One'. It still makes me feel a bit nostalgic for a time that was not that long ago in logical time but almost an eternity in human years.And here we are in a new century. If you were at all alive and listening to popular music back in the '80s then I'm sure Hall and Oates has a place in your heart as it does in mine.The fidelity on this album is good. And, upon first receiving it and playing it, I was pleasantly surprised at how salient the songs remain. These are some darn catchy tunes! I turned it up and pretended I was a kid again and I was until the album ended..."
5,hall and oats,Law and Order? 2 stars. Curds and whey? 3 stars. Peanut butter and chocolate? 3.5 stars. Rock and roll? 4 stars. Batman and Robin? 4.5 stars. Hall and Oates? 5 stars. oh yeah.
3,A bit on the dry side for cake; crumbly cookies,"I tried both the cookie and the cake from this mix. The cake was dry and had a flat taste. It did not taste like a normal yellow or white cake at all. I had to use lots of frosting to get this cake to stick together somewhat on my fork. As for the cookies, they were extremely crumbly and fell apart the minute you bit into it. I have several mixes left that I am going to experiment with to try to get them moister. Covering after baking normally works for regular cakes to retain moisture, but did not for this mix. If you can stand the crumblies, the cookies did taste good."
5,Love it!,"It's wonderful to be able to bake cakes and cookies, again. It was the only thing that I missed when I had to go gluten-free. I did not like any other GF cake flours in the market that I tried. I love this!"
2,Not good,I have tried several recipes with this mix and none of them turn out well. They taste good but everything turns to crumbles. Very dissapointed.
2,"Heavy book, but not much to learn from.","This book is unbelievably heavy but very shallow. (I feel sorry for the trees!) At first I thought it's not that bad, so I brought it to my office for reference. Every time I needed to look up something, I dug thru over 1000 pages and found nothing. After that, I never laid my fingers on this book again. It's been sitting collecting dust on my shelf for over 2 years. I want to sell it, but man, lots of people are selling it for under 2 bucks. I spent over ... and didn't get anything in return. Believe it or not, it's so heavy that you wouldn't want to carry arround. In the final analysis, you can carry a brick in your backbag and it would have the same effect. It's not worth your money!"
1,A Nightmare!,"I've just finished a Java course and, because we used this book, I feel as if I've just been through a war. I'm so glad I never had to read this book again. I wish I could return it.If you enjoy staying up until 5 am bouncing from internet chatroom to chatroom begging other Java programmers to help you with your homework because the book you're using is completely incoherent, then THIS is the book for YOU!btw- NO info on EJB? The book states that if you want to learn about EJB you should visit a web site. And you're charging HOW MUCH for this book?Totally unacceptable."
1,An excellent Book,"Actually I rate it four stars; I noticed they put the ""one star"" reviews first. The book is good for beginners, bottom line--- Hello...note the title. For you who have a programmer's superiority complex (we all know the type---in the office or the classroom) this book is not for ya!But if you are like me, and like to start with the fundamentals, and you do the UML and the algorithm thing (or are training to) like a good programmer should, then you are an entrepreneur at heart, and not just some overpaid employee on borrowed time!Get this book, and others; it's part of the foundation all aspiring programmers (and their potential bosses) should have."
5,A very efficient Java book for all level Java programers !,"Indeed, I've had the first and second edition of this book too. The best two things about this book are the clear architecture and those very usefull examples which cover almost most of the parts. I can easy to find what I'm looking for and learn what I want to know as always."
1,Don't get this book,"If you already have a clue as how to program, skip this book. It won't tell you anything useful in any way, shape, or form. It's coverage of the Java language is useless. It has no explation as to how parts of Java interact with the other parts of Java. The examples are idiotic and have no real application to anything, including academic exercises. Instead of focusing on how to extend the JApplet interface, the authors have chosen to extend the JFrame interface which will only run if you decide to use Java as an application (like MSWord) instead of an internet Applet. This tends to leave out large portions of what would be called useful information. In general if you value your brain, avoid this book."
5,It never leaves my desk,"I am an intermediate skill Java programmer and still refer to those tomes which got me started from time to time, but none is more worn than JHTP. What I love about this book is its comprehensiveness and accuracy. Want to learn about JavaBeans, JDBC, even basic SQL queries. It's all here. And the way the examples are documented and explained is the most intuitive I have ever seen. At the end of each chapter are long lists of important points to know as well as involved quizzes and exercises. Some of the exercises are programming classics that any hardcore programmer should know how to build and run. This book is awesome. My only complaint is the scant coverage of garbage collection and the inner workings of the JVM (but that's where Bill Venners comes in)."
3,Decent learning tool for java 2.,"I purchased this book for a class in Java programming. While I would not recommend this book to someone who has had no programming experience whatsoever, it's good for someone who has taken one or two beginning courses. It has a ton of examples, which are not only in the book but also included on a CDROM that comes with the book. For a beginner using this book to learn Java, I would recommend purchasing ""Learn Java in 21 Days"" as a supplemental text."
2,Ummm.... this book teaches Java???,"Had to get this book for my Java programming class too. Thought this book might be good, but hang on... price of a book doesn't say everything.If you like pondering for half hour why a particular line did something, then go ahead and use this book, its poorly organized otherwise. In my opinion, I just didn't like this book all too much, and would rather care less about their examples, even though they are simple examples. What they don't explain is how to think like a programmer, just what certain commands in Java does.People with programming experience in other languages (esp. C, C++), you'll have no problem using this book, but otherwise don't bother, you can do better... unless of course your instructor told you that this book is required for the course too."
1,I changed my mind...,"I wrote an earlier review of this book that was good, but I've changed my mind. I read the second version of this book (not actuall this one) I've since read ""Beginning Java 2.0"" by Ivor Horton. THAT is the book you want! It's an excellent book for a much lower price! Read it's reviews, I think on average it got about 4 1/2 stars. I'm not an experence programmer, but I know how to and not how to write code and the Deitel book is how not to."
1,Just not a good book,"Don't be fooled by the high price. In this case, price doesn't correlate into a well-written and informative book. This book seems like it was translated from C++. You won't learn how to think in Java from this book."
1,A book for lazy teachers,This book is for professors who are too lazy to develop quality examples and problems for their students. Just because a book has a teaching edition and small assignments is no reason to stick students with this terrible book.
1,Really bad! These guys need to learn how to write.,"The most confusing programming book I have ever read. I am used to insightful, clear explainations like those typically found O'Reilly's Java books. This book doesn't even come close. The book give the reader the false sense that Java is just another procedural language like C or RPG. This is not surprising; books written for a procedural language and adapted to a new language often maintain the mind set of the old language. These authors clearly do not understand how to think in object-oriented terms and the sure don't know how to teach it."
1,How to sell your book.,"As with all the Deitel books, there seems to be an extraordinary number of glowing 5-star stating that book is the greatest book ever written mixed in with lots of horrible reviews. There seems to be a strategy: Drown all the bad reviews with walk-on-water reviews. There are just too many bad reviews to dismiss them. I agree with all the poor reviews below. Very few book warrant a 5-star review and this book is not one of them."
2,Bad book for online class.,I have to disagree with most people about this book. I'm using it for an online college class and it's awful. The exercises are poorly written an often need further clarification. Many of the exercises put at emphasis on math in such a way you need to be a mathmetician instead of a programmer to figure them out. As a reference book it would be O.K. but it's not good for classes.
4,Complete book for THE JAVA PROGRAMMER !,"""The book covers all facets of the Java language."" And that is true, not like some other books which make you go indepth and you just miss some important topics. This book covers all the knowledge you need on JAVA. Splendid work done by the Deitel's again after the C and the C++ books. Myself am a mainframe programmer however this book makes me feel like I know Client/Server environment and OOP since a long time."
4,Don't go to work without it,"I especially like this book because the code examples are complete, fully explained and not just snippets of code that need to be pieced together into some coherent whole. I'm in a working environment where I need to learn and use JAVA at the same time and don't have the luxury of asking what a particular line of code does, and why it's there. The examples are robust enough so that they come pretty close to what needs to get done. For those of use who think stealing code is ok, and want to jump start their project this is book to use and steal code from. I expect, that Deitel will reach the lofty status of my dogeared, falling apart and generally abused K& R."
3,"For a student, not as bad as they say","To me, the Deitel & Deitel books always have been for instructors as much as for students. They have a fairly complete instructor's edition with answers to problems, pdf verisons of diagrams, etc. This is truly a textbook, and good for students without prior experience. Every Java book I've ever read has had problems in one area or another, and this is no exception. (See all the reviews above.) But this third edition is also fairly comprehensive, and its shortcomings are made up for by its benefits."
5,java book review,"This was a fantastic book in all aspects of the java language. I read it three times last year back to back, and thats unusual with my time. I took the Sun certification course and along with their book, the Java2 certification book, and deitels book I passed the certification. I plan on purchasing the next edition,"
1,one of the worst cs books I've ever read,"This is one of the worst cs books I have ever read. The authors repeat themselves so many times, many times. No attention is paid to object oriented programming. Many of the examples do not even work without some tinkering and their explanations of the examples doesn't tell you anything more than what you could read on the documentation page on the sun web site. Do not waste your money"
1,Boorrrringg !,"The layout and letter font of the book is terrible. The book is monotone and not exciting at all. I think including data or facts in tables or pictures greatly help readers to keep them interested in the subjects. Size 12 font would be nice to read also.....I think it'll make reading more pleasant. Some information are redundant. This is not a Java for Dummies book. The book is crowded too, by that ....I mean I can barely see a space in one page. The authors have too much information in one page.That's all."
1,Java How to Program,This book doesn't stand where it has to its all hype without any content.Dont waste money on it .It says it includes a cd but its useless as this book. you cant even copy any files into your system .Its most useless cd and book I ever had.
2,Weak in details,"This is a good introduction to Java, but don't expect to learn much about any of the advanced topics listed in the index. The chapter on RMI, for example, has more about GUI development then RMI in it. It seems the authors wanted to at least list all the key buzz words, even though they did not really have anything to say about some of them. This is a good book if you know nothing about Java or programming."
5,Absolutely wonderful,"You don't have to know c , or c++ to read this book. The author takes nothing for granted and explains everything in detail with lots of examples. A book for building a strong foundation in JAVA with ease."
5,A Book for Novice and Professional Alike,"This book is truly a triumph. The Deitel's have attained that fine balance between a book suitable for novice and professional.The Deitel's work on this book is excellent. They manage to take the learner from introductory to intermediate level with their examples, a task which is often missing in texts.Even if you have seen the previous editions, this one is a ""must have"" for those seeking professional skills in Java.The CD version which has just come out really helps you understand the code. You can go over the programs multiple times when necessary.This is the best edition so far!"
2,"Average book, way too expensive!","This Java How to program is an average book, compare to many other Java books. However, this book is about the twice the price of the other Java books. Why?I would rate the book a 3 stars. However, when you consider the $68 tag, I think it only deserves a 2 stars."
3,"Thorough, if not a bit confusing","The book does a good job of explaining what Java is and how to use the various components. It also has a lot of good advice and hints but... it does a poor job of explaining WHEN to use one component over another.That's understandable in a book designed to be a compliment to a real live teacher and a classroom environment. But it's almost unexcusable in a book designed to be read at home a-la ""Teach Yourself"" style.I've been reading the book for a month now and have choked my way through the section on arrays. I'm learning - but MAN IS IT CONFUSING!"
1,UGLY!,"This book is comparable to the author's web site. Their web site's home page is gaudy and has a terrible user interface. Its a great example of what NOT to do. This book is of the same quality. If you want to ""learn"" to write software like that, then this book is for you. You'll find the same clueless approach throughout this book."
1,repetitive and unclear,"This book is very unclear and repetitive. They attempt to cover the same topics that are available for free on the sun web site, except they fail miserably. Not only will you not learn how to program by reading this book, you will gain no apprecation for object-oriented programming either."
1,Unsound for CS1 courses,"I have taught CS1 with this book in its C, C++ and Java incantations. The examples and ogainization are all quite similar. People either love the book or hate it. For myself, I think waiting 6 chapters to cover object oriented issues, like how to write a class, is a serious error. Students tend to get ""Procedural Brain damage"" when object oriented programming is not introduced ealier.The book is not a good reference and becomes shelf-ware after a first read. CS1 topic coverageis OK, but not great. Too much AWT and not enough data structures.If you are looking for a good CS1 book, look elsewhere."
1,A rich price for a poor textbook,"I am sorry to say that I was required to spend $68 this title. It gives examples without explaining all the terms and concepts involved, and it mixes together discussions of applets and stand-alone programs in a way I found confusing and illogical. Even the course instructor had a low opinion of the book and did not use it much in classroom teaching."
3,Change the publisher!,"Plenty of good examples and many many challenging problems. I love it! BUT, every single page I turn falls apart too easily. I only had this book for two months and already it looks like a rag( I didn't even beat it ). They must change the publisher! Minus 2 stars!"
2,Java How To Program,there is too much confusing and disorganized information in this book. It might be a reference book for well experienced java programmers but definitely it is not a book for an introduction to Programming class.
1,Not worth the time or money,"The authors don't use standard Java terminology. As an example, their explanation of reference passing is very confusing. They say things like variables are passed ""call-by-value"". This is just one of the many C-like terms they use which demonstrate they don't understand object-oriented programming. Reading this book is like reading grossly over commented code. Not only do they clutter valuable information with minutia, their explanations are sophomoric. The book's explanations of object-oriented programming lacks focus: One discussion can mix 3 or 4 metaphors which only serves to confuse readers. Concepts are made to seem complicated with verbose explanations and excessive terminology. In addition, the book is downright boring and poorly organized. If you want a book someone will have to explain to you - this is it."
1,This book teaches programming ? in Java ?,I guess you can find a needle in a haystack too. Have these guys ever taken a writing class? Read a book on how to present information clearly? You could write a book on what NOT to do for each of these topics using this book as an example.
1,"Poorly written, confusing for students","I thought this was going to be as good as C How to Program, however this book was a big disappointment for me. Too many simple and useless examples, hard to get the point."
4,Not A Reference Book,"If you know absolutely nothing about Java and very little about programming in general ... you might find this book useful. It takes example source code and explains what the code is doing statement by statement. At times, it explains too much.For experienced programmers who just want a reference to the Java language commands and syntax ... well, it's pretty much useless. A lot of the information is there, but it's not easy to find."
5,"Best ""How to"" Book and Program I ever used","Excellent learning source! especially for beginners!The examples were simple yet made the point they were trying to make.The book is written in plain everyday English so you do not need a programmer's dictionary to follow along! Also their writing style is very ""friendly"".I found it much easier running the program on my PC and being able to review the lesson, view the source codes and try my own without having to constantly flip back and forth in a book. Although the book will now come in handy for reference.My one suggestion would be that they show how to convert more applications to applets."
5,Finally a Java book for non-C programmers!,"This is the first Java book I found that didn't insist you go off and learn C before attempting to learn Java. I'm a Visual Basic programmer, the whole reason I wanted to learn Java was so I could avoid C altogether. After Core Java and Just Java, this book was a huge relief.There are absolutely stackloads of examples, and it pops in many general programming and design tips too.If you want to learn Java and don't know C, get this book. Believe me, it is worth the $70."
1,"Overpriced, Confusing and Worthless... Ouch!","I *HAD* to purchase this book as it was used as a textbook for the introductory Java course that I took in college.Luckily, the professor supplied us with decent in-class notes, because studying from this text was a nightmare. The OOP concepts and language features are explained poorly and only confuse the reader. Code examples are also poor. It's hard to find something useful in the book if you want to use it as a reference when building your own applications. And finally, you can buy at least 2 excellent java books for this price. Try Sun's ""Core Java"" series or Herbert Schildt's titles, they are better written and are a lot more useful."
2,Not Worth it if you are new to Java,"In their efforts to parallel their ""C++-how to program"", the Deitels have only made their ""Java -how to program"" very confusing for a beginner -Java, unlike C++ is a purely object oriented language, hence it doesn't make sense to see real object oriented programming start in chapter 8 -while the reader is supposed to take whatever is presented in first 7 chapters at face value.The Deitels spend way too many pages explaining every concept and that accounts for the sheer girth of the book and a lot of it is redundant.This is a ok book if you want to see a lot of sample code or if you want to try the exercises but definitely not the book if you are a beginner.I would recommend ""Thinking in Java"" by Bruce Eckel if you are new to Java and then a look at this book to look at the huge sample code and try out some of the challenging exercises."
3,"Good book , but ...","I remember writing a review of this book in the past, having read 5 chapters of it,was impressed at that time because i was able to create simple gui applications (i.e. user input, computations, etc.). But I nevertheless lost interest after 5 chapters because of too much explanation and thickness of the book , repeating each item quite fairly 2-3 times in every page. After 5 chapters, I still don't know the concept of OOP, much more classes and objects in general. I personally consider this a good book, but target audience should be programmers coming from other programming languages and not for beginners. If you want to get a good grip of OOP get SAMS Teachyourself JAVA 2 platform in 21 days, that's what I used and still reading up to this point, and after 7 days, I thoroughly understand OOP and the power of JAVA."
4,Thorough and Complete: A Good Starting Point,"This book is fun to read and learn from. The exercises at the end of the chapters are interesting and able to be completed with a little effort. Some of the sections need two or three (or more) readings to understand, but I was eventually able to understand all the text. Because of this book I successfully passed the Sun certification for Java 2 Programming exam."
1,Only for beginners. (Really beginners),"I do not recommend this book unless you are really, really new to programming. It expends too much space explaining basic things and too litle space explaining what is truly Java and OOP. There are explanations that come too late in the text and for instance you understand some things in chapter 4 that should be explained in chapter 1."
1,Where's the beef?,"You know the ""training courses"" where, after an entire day, you think: ""We've covered one hour of information so far and they have wasted 7 hours of my time."" In reality, you have covered one hour on information packaged with 7 hours of fluff so that the it can be sold as a full day course. Pretty standard game played by consultants. That's what you'll get from this book. And the Java information you do get is just not that informative."
3,"""Our emphasis is on pedagogy""","There are some decided bright spots about this book. The fact that it is written like a text is great for students trying to learn a language. However, more focus needs to be given to the layout of this book. Pages go on and on without section titles and the like. Also, the authors seem to devote too much time on professing their teaching beliefs and style...with phrases such as ""Our emphasis is on pedagogy""...""Our goal was clear"", etc. One final note. My college uses other Deitel books, such as the C and C++ texts. I was disappointed to find the exact same examples , paragraphs, discussions, etc in both the C++ and JAVA books. No matter how many similarities exist between the two languages, they could have come up with some new examples. The JAVA editions are the C++ editions with JAVA syntax."
1,what happened here?,"I was hoping that it wasn't just me. I've started this book 4 times now and just can seem to make any sense of it. On the cover it sounds great, but I was thinking the same thing as the other reviewer....that there must have been something lost in the translation from Spanish to English."
3,Keeps you energized,This was recommended - I'm not so sure about the weight loss factor here - but you definitely feel energized.
5,"Explains Age-Old traditions, Clearly, in everyday language","Takes the mystery out of what we do and why we do it.Finally, someone just tells us, plainly..what the meanings are, behind the traditions and how it pertains to everyone; in either, a religious and/or historical, context."
5,Top ten learning shows of all time,"These Reading Rainbow DVDs allow the legacy of this great show to live on. Most of the books my children read now were reviewed on the show over twenty years ago. Several of the books have been turned into movies, the caliber of the books and their authors is evident. i would suggest anyone who want to encourage literate kids to watch these videos. We watch the video then go get the books from the library or buy them from Amazon."
5,A good place to start,"This was one of the first tax practice marketing books I ever purchased. It's a good place to start, especially beginners. The author talks about different ways to find and market to new clients, and basic information to help a new practicioner navigate the difficulties of starting from scratch.It's an easy read, so don't expect a textbook-size tome on marketing and business start-up-- that's not what this is."
1,Complete Garbage,This book is loaded with extraneous stuff but has very little on actually marketing a tax business. In fact he talks about almost anything but that.It could be written as how to start a business and I would give it a 3but as far as tax businesses go you are going to get zero as fsr as creative marketing ideas. The book is dated as well. Needs an update...Dont waste your money.
2,Dated information,I did not discover the magic formula for having a successful tax practice from reading this book. The book is not a wealth of information.
4,Almost made me start LLC for tax preparation,"I think this was a very helpful book to assist in making the decision on whether to get into tax prep, working for oneself. There were personal success stories that helped, although they seemed limited because they showed mainly the good side of the issue.It's clear that for those working in tax preparation, it would be far more financially rewarding to start one's own tax consultancy. While there's always tax prep work available, tax strategy is considered higher-end and more lucrative if one can break into it. Or it may be best to set up a consultancy that does both, and if the author is correct, that's by far the most common model.The information and advice in this book seemed correct and reasonable."
2,Okay but.......,"The unit itself is nice and I love the thin form factor. The sound is pretty good for a unit this size.BUT (that's a big but) it is not made to work with the newest Nano. You can use the cable and it works fine, but the dock and charger don't work."
3,Does not charge nano 4G!,"It's a nice product, but unfortunately does not charge/synch the iPod nano 4th generation. The only other defect I can tell is that it turns itself off after a short time of no use, which can be annoying depending on your use. Otherwise, it has nice sound and is very compact."
2,"Not too fantastic, but okay","I bought 3 of these when I bought ipods for my sisters and my daughter. They were supposed to be compatible with the new ipod chrommatics that just came out. I wanted the girls to have something they could dock in their rooms and play music. Well, the system does allow them to play the music, but I hesitate to truly call this a real speaker system. The volume is very low. And to make matters worse, Apple has upgraded the ipod nanos so that this system does not charge the ipod while it is on the docking base. Terrible!!! The docking base is also very very small. Again, volume is not impressive. I'd probably not buy this again; something a little more powerful with better volume and sound would be preferrable. But, the girls seem relatively pleased with it. But they dont use it often. The volume is just really unimpressive."
2,planned obsolescence,Great for about a year but when I purchased a new iPod it would no longer charge it.It still plays though so I will give in 2 stars.No controls for bass or treble and does not sound great at high volume.
4,Great sound for the size,"The sound quality for this size of these speakers is excellent. I've heard better bass from other small speakers but the size, style and ability to recharge your ipod while playing makes these speakers a great value for the money."
4,Great while it worked,I have had this speaker set for three years and its always worked great until recently. It was completely compatible with my 1st gen nano and my 1st gen iPod Touch. A few days ago I accidentally gave the unit a few static shocks which have caused the power indicator light not to shut off and the sound quality to decreas. The bass is now tinny most of the time except when it randomly cuts in to its true bass potential and the sound is somewhat more staticy than it used to be. I am considering buying a replacement since it is such a nice looking and sounding unit but I'll likely upgrade to something better for my iPod Touch.
3,Great beginner bag.,"As an electrician, I have a lot of handtools. I bought this bag in hopes of using the interior pockets to better organize the various tools and my multi-meter. While the pockets do a great job of organizing, they also make it difficult to access anything in the general open area. The bag is very durable but in my opinion is not designed for anyone that has a large volume of tools."
5,365 Reasons Why Bicycles Make the Best Companions,"Absolutely hysterical !Laugh out loud funny. You'll find yourself reading aloud to anyone within earshot. So funny it hurts, literally, you're stomach muscles will ache!"
5,jane`s awesome!,jane goodall is an amazing women! her books are unbievalble! im only 11 yrs. old and im really interested in her.she risked her life to safe chimps. i hope she is happy in heaven and i hope she knows what a great person she is!
2,Kitty Kalley,I have this cd.It is of all recording companies she worked for. The liner notes were a more than mean when she talks about Jimmy Dorsey. I beleive the Harry James and the Jimmy Dorsey arrangement are what carried her vocal efforts. On her biggest hit Little things Mean A lot she starts to say heart and changes it to hand. Why didn't they correct that before the record was released.
4,great singer,"I can't blame people for thinking Kitty Kallen gave up singing for a family. It explains the lapse between years in her career. Actually Kitten stopped simply because she lost her voice. After a short comeback in the 60's Kitty had to quit because of developing blood clots in her throat. Poor Kitty not only did it happen to her once but twice.If fate hadn't done her in, she would have developed into a fantastic singer but the little available is good enough. Unfortunately half of the songs in this cd are outdated. Despite this there are enough gems to make one realize that Kitty had an unique sweet voice. My favorite ""I'm beginning to see the light"" is a classic. After hearing the song, it's an automatic reaction of mine to press rewind. Her version of ""My Coloring Book"" was before Streisand's and I know I'm being risky saying this but Kallen's version is better.Amazon has released another cd with ""Honky Tonk Angel/If I gave my heart to you"", all I can say is keep them coming."
5,History - Drama - Romance!,"Margaret Devereaux's inherent love of the sea and sailing ships shines through her novel RIDE THE RESTLESS TIDE from cover to cover. The story, rich in history, drama, and romance, is a splendid documentary of lives and times during the 18th and 19th centuries in Marblehead, a unique New England town. I found this work most interesting and enjoyed the read tremendously. This book deserves 5 stars! A reader from the Tampa Bay Area, Florida"
2,You can do better then this....,"Everytime I read these stories I have to skip sentences that are not appropriate or are violent, such as ""he liked to dwell on the arms and legs he had cut off wiht a rusty saber..."" I guess if your children are watching public television, the content with be nothing new. If, however, you are trying to protect your younger children from concepts like violence and sorcery, move on...."
5,A Delight!,"After reading other fairy books, this one is a delight. There is such originality in the way these Disney fairy books are written. Sure, you still have some typical characters like other fairy books, but many of the characters in these aren't so typical. They have more depth. Like the ""mean"" fairy Vidia, who really isn't that mean all the time. And Disney fairies aren't that clumsy. They do get into trouble, but that is the fun of these books. For example, in this one Lily, a garden fairy, finds a seed that she does not recognize. The plant grows to look ugly, smell ugly, and everything about it seems bad. But Lily still cares for the plant and knows that it is happy. This story is an example of how you can find true beauty in everything."
4,"Good, quick read","""Lily's Pesky Plant""by Kirsten Larsen(Disney/Random House, 2006)--------------------------------------This is one of the more engaging books in Disney's Tinker Bell-related Pixie Hollow series. Lily, a gardening fairy, finds a mysterious seed that sprouts and grows into an ugly, smelly seedling. The plant's pollen and goo irritate the other fairies and when they want Lily to cut it down, she refuses. Tensions rise, and Lily's strongest friends come to her defense, sharpening the divisions in the normally placid fairy community. But is Lily right? Is the plant useful after all? You betcha! One of the strongest narratives in the series, definitely worth checking out if you're into the other books! (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's book reviews)"
4,"Works great, cheap to buy","Did 500 square feet of hardwood bamboo flooring. Wasn't going to rent a nailer as outlets wanted 40-50 bucks a day (!) and since I can only do the jobs on my free time, it would take a week at least. Porta nailer is cheap and works great. Love how it wont release until nail is fully set. Takes a little practice to figure out the hammering nuances -- just do that on a piece of scrap material first, you'll then master how to drive the nail in efficiently (hint: Don't pound down so hard like you're at a circus game, get the pounding down to a nice controllable rhythm). When that's done, it's easy sailing as far as hammering in the wood. Your efforts are then transfered to the real issues -- planning, measuring, and cutting the planks to size.Don't bother with the face nail adapter, it doesn't work very well as it tends to split the wood and/or doesn't go in cleanly."
4,Good wall mount at a great price,This was a very nice wall mount. It was simple to install and the price was very good. I had my TV up and on the wall in one hour and it's still hanging there. The shipping got it there very quickly and came with all the necessary hardware. If you are looking for a simple wall mount at a great price this would be a very good choice.
3,A Love Story,"I thought this book was very sweet. Just when she thought she would live out the rest of her life alone, everything changed for Eleanor. This is a story of love and romance experienced by someone who never expected it would happen to her.I wouldn't say it was the best book I have ever read but it will still touch your heart."
4,great 60's madcap comedy,"This is one of those funny 60's bedroom comedies that make you laugh and remember a much sweeter,simpler time. Bobby Darrin and Sandra Dee met while working on this movie, and married two weeks later. For more on their story,watch ""Beyond the Sea"" a biopic with Kevin Spacey and Kate Bosworth."
3,"A bit square, but nevertheless worth a look","A pleasantly entertaining movie, if a bit laid back and not terribly energetic. It was fun to see Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee (they actually met on this film and later married), but they give snappier, more playful performances in their own vehicles such as ""That Funny Feeling"" and ""If a Man Answers"". I will say that the Italian locations are gorgeous. To end on another positive note, the DVD offers a crisp, bright widescreen image with no flaws that I could see."
3,Romantic Comedy,"A New York business man(Rock Hudson)visits his villa in Italy every September, to relax and to romance his italian girlfriend(Gina Lollobrigda); but, when he arrives unannounced a month eary(July) he is in for the surpise of his life. His luxury villia has been turned into an hotel filled with a gaggle of American girls being pursued by a herd of pining boys. To say that he is astounded, is putting in lightly and in his attempt to set things right, i.e. regain control of his villa; he manages to lose his privacy, his girlfriend and his mind. Then he comes up with a plan of his own. You'll have to see the movie to know what that plan is and whether it is successful or not - good viewing."
4,Funny farce for facing fall.,"This classic boy meets girl, Woman dumps man, Man and boy find girl and woman, while crafty sidekick creates havoc is a terrific and non-thought provoking way to escape the reality of fall falling in September.This film is not about the actors or actress off screen personalities, although one can almost see Darrin and Dee fall in love.Enjoy this film just for the fun and the music!"
3,"""I Bet She's The Fastest Thing On The Road""","'Come September' is a harmless and overall enjoyable piece of '60's fluff with a cute, harmless plot and a likable cast. You've got Rock Hudson and Bobby Fisher to keep the girls interested and Gina Lollobrigida and Sandra Dee for the guys. A little dated for the contemporary audience but the film still maintains enough nostalgic charm to find an audience."
2,Picture not good on cd,"Gave as a gift and dvd was not clear thru the whole movie. She said that the blues and red were very bold sometimes thru the movie. She does not have any problems with any other dvd that she plays on her system. I was embarrassed for it was a gift. Not a happy customer but since she is in New York and it was cost too much to mail back, we deceided to keep it."
5,Wonderful!,Love this old movie ...thank you for the fast delivery...exactly what I was looking for! I watched it within an hour of receiving it ... they don't make movies like this anymore...just a great fun movie!
2,SO-SO,I got this for a church sing-a-long and the music was either too fast or too slow or the intro really didn't let you know where to come in. I was not impressed
3,Porta-Nails,"The product is original but the packaging was loosely packed resulting in the nail packets being broken into smaller pieces, causes difficulty in loading and last nails slipping away in the nail gun"
3,Good but not Awesome,"We had pancakes from this mix this AM. Used eggwhites instead of whole eggs, because that's all we had. Otherwise followed the package directions exactly.They were good. They were a bit grainy but light and fluffy. They browned nicely and cut well. Mine had a tendency to fall apart when picked up with a fork, but not badly.Personally, I prefer Bisquik Gluten Free for pancakes.If I couldn't get Bisquik GF, I wouldn't mind these at all."
5,Easy and Just Like the Real Thing,"I made these for the first time today, using a pan instead of a griddle. Otherwise, I followed the directions precisely.The resulting pancakes were a little thick (my wheat-eating SO dubbed some of them layer-pan-cakes for their height), but otherwise perfect. I started squashing them in the pan after flipping, which thinned the pancake, or I could have added more milk.I made half of the pancakes as-is, then added chocolate chips to the last half of the batter. Yum! They were all scarfed up. The directions for half of the mix fed two small but hungry people, four pancakes each with 2 left over. I would count on at least one box for every four people.Enjoy your pancakes! We were pleasantly surprised by these, and I'll be making them again soon."
5,Gluten-Free Pantry Pancake Mix,"My husband is a celiac and we have tried many pancake mixes. This one is by far the best we have found. He likes them a little thinner than the recipe calls for, so I add a little additional milk when mixing. The taste and consistancy is the closest to 'real' pancakes. This company makes many fine products."
5,Very good pancakes,These pancakes are the best tasting ones that I have ever made at home. They taste very similar to the ones I buy from Original Pancake House.I found that you should put a little extra liquid in the mix if you don't want thick pancakes.
1,Not close to real truffles.,I had seen a lot of promo regarding this product so I finally bought some. I really hated them. In my opinion the taste is not worth the 30 calories. I'd rather just eat less of real chocolate.
4,Lighthearted and fun!,The Fine Art of Flirting is a lighthearted approach to enticing others. Flirting properly can be a significant useful tool to attract the opposite sex. In the proper context flirting can be a lot of fun...The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking
3,Out of Date,"I bought this recently, fooled by the bright snazzy cover. Should have looked at when it was written - the early 80's. While some of the basics of flirting are probably the same, too much of this is too out-of-date."
2,Not what I hoped for.,The CD was now what I hoped for. I had hoped for Gene's voice in clearer and smoother tones. This is a really old recording. The company was wonderful with packaging and delivery and price. No complaints with them.
2,Dont go for it if you can spend some more $s,"Leaks a lot, I bought two of it for me and my wife, both of them leaks a lot around forehead and side of the eyes. To get it fit you have to have a face with a size of a basketball."
4,Easy to build!,"Quick, Easy wayt to build sturdy shelves. To have more choices of configurations you may want to buy more than one unit at a time. Then you can build more shelves on each unit."
3,Brackets don't fit 2x4's snugly,"I was disappointed to see a 1/4"" gap between the 2x4 and the bracket on the longer dimension. (My 2x4's are 1-1/2""x3-1/2"", but the opening is 3-3/4"" wide.)"
4,Good price! Sturdy product! Could use some minor changes.,"I picked the ""Sand"" color, because I didn't want the ShelfLinks to stand out the way the Black ones do, and they look great! I have been having problems with water in my basement and purchased these as a way to not only get my belongings off the ground, but the 2x4's that make up the shelves. I'm confident I did so with this product after a few minor adjustments. This product is designed to allow the 2x4 to pass completely through the openings, but in my case I wanted to use them on the ground and leave a half inch between the ground and the 2x4, so I drilled a few more holes for better support and it worked well. Great product at a great price! Can be a little challenging with having to flip everything over to screw into the bottom of your shelves, but the shelves are very sturdy once you are finished. ""Measure twice, cut once!"""
5,Cream of Tarter,"The purchase went smoothly, price was good, and the product was received within a couple of days. I will make this purchase again, when needed."
5,best laminate blade!,"i bought this blade optimistically. i wasn't really sure if they hype was all there. but when i cut the first peice of maple ply, i was amazed. the sheer cleanness left from this blade is outstanding! the sand grit on the sides leaves a perfectly smooth edge with no need to clean up. no zero clearance throats are needed. says designed for melamine but for hardwood plys this thing is absolutely the best blade i have by far ever used"
4,So Chic....,"My 7 year-old daughter loves this salon. She loves to pamper her dolls with manicures, massages and chic hair styles. The set has some really cute items including foils for the doll's hair and massage table. For the price of this item it is well worth it. The salon comes with a lot of furniture that stays together reasonably well for Barbie furniture. Highly recommended to the girl that's into Barbie My Scene."
5,A MUST BUY TOY,"ok this toy is great! I am a my scene luver and if you are it's the thing for you!!! I know how they have a bratz salon and i was praying they would come out with a my scene salon! It is just sooooo fun to have all your my scene girls in a really neat salon!thanks 4 reading, #1 my scene fan!"
2,Boring,Yes this CD will put you to sleep in minutes. Its the most boring uninspiring classical music. The first CD was very good but this Vol. 2 is like most movie sequels....AWFUL !
5,SERIOUS HERPETOLOGISTS ONLY,"I won't recapitulate what you find in the description. Simply put, as a herpetologist who works with, and rescues, crocodilians, venomous snakes, wide varieties of turtles, lizards and snakes I can't do with out this book. Actually I have two copies, one is downstairs with the animals where it has been dropped into turtle tanks and has some very interesting stains on it and the other is in my library. My point is that this book is too useful not to have on hand."
5,Brilliant!,"This is the BEST reptile book i ever had the pleasure of owning! Brilliant pictures, easy to read text and very complete tables!If you are a veterinary surgeon starting your experience on reptiles dont think twice... It was my case and i just loved it... this one lays next to Guilhermo Couto Small Animal Medicine and Theresa Fossum on my top 3 Veterinary Surgeons Bibles!"
3,Damaged book,The book was damaged in all corners on the cover due to poor packing. I was given a discount of 20%
4,Get this TIP for free from www.health.org,"There is no need to purchase this book. SAMHSA/NCADI will ship you up to 50 copies for free, right to your front door. Go to www.health.org and look under Publications, Pubs in Series, TIPS. Pretty much everything on the site is free except for videos and dvds. Your tax dollars at work."
2,the buttons stick,I want a phone that my houseguests can use to make calls on my Skype account while i am at work. The buttons on this phone stick and enter the same numeral several times when pushed only once: like the keys on an old-fashioned electric typewriter.
5,Excellent!,"If you are a fan you will love this video. If you are not a fan, you will be after watching it. Production quality and sound are excellent,and that's coming from an audiophile...."
3,Interesting start,"I had a chance to listen to the band live in St.-Petersburg, Russia. It sounded really professional. It is the band's first album which brought them to fame in St.-Petersburg and Germany. so, enjoy"
3,A good source for beginner,"This book is a good source on analyzing geometric problem of linkage designs. It provided a good solution for simple linkage problem, especially a four bar linkage design. More practical approaches and easier drawing sketches would be great."
2,not as good as,"A lot of the photos look alike. the quotes are pretty good, but the pictures should be more diverse. I suggest Jim Dratfield's books, which have the creative photos as well as the creative words!"
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"Maybe the positive reviews on this book had me expecting a little more than I should have. The pictures are adorable, but the prose is just not for me. I was thinking it would be more witty, humorous writing to go with the pictures, but it seemed more like the writer was just trying to get words to rhyme.For the price I paid, it was ok. Wouldn't buy it again if I had the choice though."
2,No celebration,"Many of the asides, anecdotes and reflections are charming, many dark. Few are deep and none reflect the soaring beauty and powerful moving joy of hearing Jerry in person. This book stands as a ragged timeline of turning points high and low of Garcia and the Dead family by a cleric, not a dancer."
2,Tabloid-Like,"Having read most of the major Garcia biographies, this is my least favorite.While I like the concept -- an oral history -- a collection of bits and pieces of interviews put together to create a cohesive story, I thought that Greenfield focused too strongly on Garcia's drug condition and problems with women, while almost ignoring the man's real gifts.It is valuable in that no other history of Garcia's life has this amount of deeply personal information, but at the same time I take no joy in reading an almost tabloid account of his life. Dark Star seems to spend all it's time telling the reader why they shouldn't like or respect Garcia -- and although he had his problems, he was also a master musician and songwriter as well as posterboy for a whole generation"
2,worked really well but stopped working pretty quickly!,"As soon as we got this started on my Great Pyrenees it worked to curb his barking really well, but it stopped working within a month. Then I got another one and it did the same thing!"
2,Don't buy this,"Don't buy this. I've already been through two of these things. It's great and stopped my dog from barking, but still broke after only a couple of weeks. The idea behind it totally works for excessive barking, but go with another brand, maybe they have better quality products."
1,Below 1 star,"I ordered three units for my 3 dogs. Two of the collars did not work right out of the box and one worked for about three days then stoped working. not worth the hassle. If you order, these just know that you were warned.Fred Bond"
1,Junk. Stopped working after 2 days.,"Worked fine for 2 days but then stopped spraying. Refilled it and changed the battery and it still didn't work even though the power light is on. And it's not returnable because it's a ""hazardous material"" so I'm stuck with it and it will be even harder to train my dog now. Total waste of money."
1,WON'T WORK,"And I don't mean that it didn't stop the dog from barking. I mean that it never SPRAYED. And Amazon won't let me return it because it's considered ""hazardous material."" Dobn't other with this unless you're SURE you'll get a working unit."
5,settling a barking beagle,"your collar is awesome. results were happening the 1st 24 hours. when he was sprayed i followed with ""no barking"". after a week i wore the collar without the battery and he still refrained from barking. i have recommended the collar to other dog owners. now i love ""Ricky, the beagle"" even more."
4,Definitely improved our barkaholic German Shepherd,"So we've been using this collar for a couple of weeks now and overall I'm pleasedThe Good1) Effective at curbing barking. The amount of nuisance barking has decreased by 95%. Although the dog has learned there is a certain decibel level he can still bark at and NOT get sprayed, that level is completely tolerable and for the most part he has completely stopped barking both inside and out. We've tried lots of other methods and this collar is the only one that has consistently delivered results2) Easy to use, easy to refill3) Our dog smells much better now :)The BadThe collar is VERY cheaply made, constantly loosening up. I was initially happy it was one size fits all, however, we've had to tape it to prevent the dog from grabbing at the loose end. The spray box (for lack of a better term) frequently slides around (despite assembling it as instructed) and the nylon collar itself keeps stretching. I suspect the collar will fail long before the spray box"
3,"Works ok, I think...","We bought this for our dachshund who barks a fair amount during the day while we're gone. Audio and video monitoring shows that she barks less, but she doesn't stop entirely. Unfortunately, it's not possible to ""test"" this collar like you can with other collars - other than somehow prompting the dog to bark in your presence while wearing it. It seems to be working, I just question how effectively and I can't test it to see if the battery and/or spray are indeed functioning properly."
3,Worked for awhile,"I have a 10 pound Min-Pin who barks maniacally to the point my husband wants to get rid of him (he's my baby). So, I spent the $50+ bucks on the Innotek collar. We did everything in the directions, including letting him get used to the collar for nearly a week before adding in the spray. At first the spray startled him enough that he stopped barking, and seemed to work well, but then he kind of got used to it. I'm going to try it again before giving up and going for the shock collar. I wish I'd chosen lemon scent, the citronella really stinks to me, but doesn't seem to bother him too much!"
3,Face Nailer a disappointment for hard wood,"The face nailer did not work well with Brazillian cherry 3/4 inch hardwood. I ws installing the wood on an old floor that had some ""bounce"" so nailing near the wall proved impractical. The unit gave too much bounce and marred the surface. I resorted to pre-drililng these courses (or strips) and face nailing with finishing nails. Slow and painful but a nice result."
1,DONT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP,Dont get this It crack in my fish tank . I Should Have Listen TO All the Negativity. Now I have to Buy a New One Great
2,Okay,"Heater does heat the tank sure but the temp varies by about 6 degrees throughout the day which can be very hard on fish, it also does make the buzzing noise when trying to decide if it wants to shut off or not and the water line is so high that the water needs to be less than an inch from the rim of ur tank. All in all not a good unit"
2,Bad Language for Kids 9-12?,"It's one thing to name a character ""Fulluvit."" Get it?""Full of it"" as in ""Full of ****?""But yet another character in this book is named ""Bullshik.""That names needs no explanation.It seems the author is as intent on drawing pre-adolescent sniggers as he is in writing for kids.We don't need that and our school and public library have been notified to scrutinize his titles."
1,BEWARE! Innappropriate Language!,"I bought this book to read to one of my boys (6 at the time). Thankfully, I was the one reading it and was able to change the character's name to something other that BULLSHIK. I was SO VERY disappointed in the author and the usage of this word in the book for 3rd to 6th graders! I found this book the other day behind some other books on a shelf. I grabbed and it and decided to write something here. As soon as I'm done typing, I'm going to tear the book up and throw it up in the trash. I have never done that before but I don't want my now 8-year old to read it and I don't want to give it away. So I have no other choice. Goodbye Time Warp Trio - Viking It and Liking It! So long and good riddens!"
4,I'm glad I can still find Playmobil train cars,"My daughter and I wanted to purchase a train car for our LGB train this past Christmas, but LGB cars are not only expensive, but also fragile. Besides that, they're not much fun for a three year old to play with. When I was growing up, my family had LGB trains with Playmobil cars, and those were a lot of fun since they were playable and had lots of moving parts. The problem is that they are really difficult to find. I was thrilled when I discovered this train car on Amazon. It was reasonably priced. My daughter loved hooking it up to our train, and she found countless things to put in the buckets and dump out. This car is a lot of fun for anybody who has a child, is a child, or acts like a child."
5,Easy to build...,My dad and I built 4' x 3' workbench with 2 shelves a couple weeks ago. I used the shelflinks to creat supports for a peg board on the back of the work bench. I will do like others and mount a light and power strip. I did my research before purchasing and knew lumber *was not* included.
4,"Nice, sturdy bench","Assembly was easy, but you'd have to be pretty clever to assemble it by yourself. Get another person to help, if you can- another pair of hands go a long way. Other than that, it all just pops in place and screws together. I like the versatility of being able to buy/cut your lumber to your own preferences, for your bench to best fit your needs. All & all I'm quite happy with this bench kit. I'd have given it 5 stars if it was $10-$15 cheaper. Quality lumber isn't exactly free, so this isn't the cheapest workbench you can find. Even though the build quality will be better than a Chinese-made workbench of equal $$, you DO have to build it yourself. Still, I would buy again. And probably will."
4,"Great kit, except for one little thing...","This is a great kit and using it, I was able to build a very solid workbench. The leg clamps and storage hooks that come with it are a nice bonus. I subtracted one star because the screws that came with it were a little too short to get a good bite into the wood. I ended up using 1.5 inch wood screws to assemble it and it's rock solid. I made mine 6' by 3' with a shelf on the bottom and used the shelf links to build a hutch with a pegboard back wall. Plenty of work and storage space. I spent about $100 for lumber. Like several others have stated, this kit does not come with lumber. The pictures are meant to representative of what you can build using your own lumber."
4,Strong Workbench,"This is an excellent product; easy to assemble strong and affordable, instructions could be a little clearer. As for the set of clamps that are included they are not very functional (for me anyway) What really helped me in the assemble was going to Fenlys web site http://www.2x4basics.com and using the picture that has a precut list for different size tables, this should be included with shipment. Overall I am extremely happy with the product but I must take away 1 star, for those few things I mentioned."
5,"So nice, I bought it twice!","...one at our old house, didn't have the heart to disassemble when we moved, so we bought another for the new house. Build your own custom workbench for a fraction of the cost of prefab! You don't have to be a carpenter, but when my contractor saw it, he was so impressed he'll use it himself for future projects."
4,Workbench review,"The workbench legs themselves are well built and assembly was very quick. One downside was that the shelf heights are fixed. The 16"" wide shelf components included in the package aren't something I wanted, but I'm sure I can give them away. Finally, the text-free instructions could have been a bit clearer; floor-shelf heights, for example could have been shown. However, overall the legs were a great product and I expect to buy another set for a second workbench."
1,Great Bench,"Okay...so i didn't purchase this bench (I was about to) but i based it on the one i built in less than three hours on one saturday. I first went to Home Depot to buy my lumber which came out to be around 65 dollars. This is the exact same price of this kit without the lumber. So in the end I would have spent double. Rather than paying for plastic (which I'm sure would have been good ones) I bought 4*4's for the legs, 2*4's for the frame and 2*6's for the bench top and shelving below. It is so sturdy and probably ways around 90-100 lbs. You want a good sturdy bench. You don't want to use a piece of plywood like you have seen in these pictures beacause you are going to be pounding hammering, sawing etc. I know mine will last forever as long as i take care of. All it needs now is a coat of sealant. This prevents the moisture from getting inside especially during the winter. Just because it's in the garage doesn't mean there isn't any moisture."
1,Misrepresented,"I was very disappointed with Amazon and will likely never use again to purchase online. The product was not sold as shown on the web and useless. The picture you show has shelves and is a complete workbench. Instead, what I received was a few plastic support pieces. Upon returning, Amazon told me I would be charged shipping for returning this useless piece. I would guess I purchased over $25,000 in goods over the internet in the past two years. You have lost a good prospect for your future services and products. If you would represent your product properly, if would not have been returned. Charging me the shipping on the return was an Amazon decision that loses a customer. Bad business decision in my view. Please remove me from your email list as I have no interest in anything you may offer in the future.Scott"
4,"good bench, but may be missing parts","I got this bench quickly in an intact carton, assembled it as directed without diffaculty but found it is missing the gray clamps and the hooks described and illustrated in the instructions and online pics.It seems sturdy enough for my needs, and I was able to cut the pieces in my garage and transport them thru a narrow doorway into a cellar shop space for assembly.Made mine 4ft long and 30in deep, and the shelf unit 5ft by 4 ft."
5,"Great product, reasonable price",Put this together in an afternoon with 8 foot 2x4's...used my own exterior torx head screws so I didn't predrill. Very solid workbench..I definitely will buy mor 2x4basics products.
5,Great Buy,"This kit was well worth the money. I needed a kit that would let me choose the size of bench to make(65""24"").Easy to understand instructions.A few of the earlier reviews were very helpful. Buy larger screws. Home Depot made all the wood cuts I needed.Total cost of lumber $82.00. I used 3/4"" Mdf sheets for my 2 shelves and a nice finished grade plywood for the top.It took about 2 hours to build the bench(I will add additional shelves another day). I'm just average at building skills.The product website has a bunch of pictures of benches built by other buyers.That was great info.You can't go wrong with this kit."
5,Easy Assembly -- Very sturdy!,"Easy to assemble. Buy your own lumber for the size bench you need. Very sturdy. Added shelf components a plus. Instructions are OK, but not great. One error on instructions - don't use a 3/8"" drill bit for the screw holes - that's too big. Use a 3/16"" bit.Bottom Line: Economical + sturdy + easy to assemble = Very satisfied!"
1,Nick's Trick,"I must completely agree with ""Ripped Pants ? RIPPED OFF !!"" review. I own every piece of animation ever released by ol' spongie including the out of sequence $15.00 money makers Snick released one by one & this will be the 1st time I save the $15 bucks towards a nice dinner out with my wife. This is such a blatant excuse to try & make a buck that I don't even care if my collection is one DVD short because of it. As for ""Help Wanted"" [the pilot, and one of the best episodes ever]; I was told by ""someone"", & who knows how reliable this is, that they couldn't secure the rights to the Tiny Tim song ""Having A Wonderful Time"" for the DVD release. Whatever the reason, that 1st season is incomplete without this episode as far as I'm concerned. Looks like I'm now (im)patiently waiting for season 3. Hope it was worth it Tricky Slicky Nicky. I'm out"
3,?,"All the episodes on this DVD can be found on both the Complete 1st Season and the Complete 2nd Season. Here are the stories:1. ""Home Sweet Pineapple""2. ""Band Geeks""3. ""Sandy SpongeBob and the Worm""4. ""Ripped Pants""5. ""Sandy's Rocket""6. ""Culture Shock""7. ""MuscleBob BuffPants""8. ""Employee of the Month""These are great episodes, don't get me wrong, but for about $22 dollars more, you can just buy a full season where you get 32 more episodes than this DVD. So do yourself a favor and save a little more cash to buy a full season instead."
2,repeats - ripoff!,"I agree with the other reviewers - This is no way to reward the loyal fans who have collected every DVD released so far - repeating episodes that are on previous DVD's! And the special features are lame. Lets have more of the behide the scenes of the voice actors. Poor quality product here, Nickelodeon."
1,No Good,"For the past couple of years I have always looked forward to getting new spongebob dvds. The periodic release every other couple of months was so very perfect to satiate my desire for the sponge. This time has obviously come to a temporary end, and it is safe to say I terribly disagree with this release. I would like to be able to buy ""NEW"" (unreleased and outside of the complete seasons) episodes in this manner. This is one fan's point of view."
2,Disappointed overall,"While this has some great episodes on it, at least two of the episodes are duplicates from previous DVD releases (Band Geeks and Ripped Pants). I was hoping for the DVD with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy IV on it. Guess I will still have to wait unless I want to check the season DVD collections."
2,"this is a joke, right?","now i'm sorry i didn't wait for the season collections...Nick has begun repeating the shows, as already mentioned below. i'm a bit disappointed."
2,Disapointment! A ditto!!!!!,"I have every Spongebob DVD and I always get them the day they come out! I've seen every Spongebob episide atleast 10 times! When I brought home the DVD of Home Sweet Pineapple, I rushed it to the DVD player, presed play all, and thought, ""why did I waste my money?"" I thought of a good list of episodes that could be on this DVD:Home Sweet Pineapple {of corse}One Krab's TrashHelp Wanted/Reef BlowerI'm Your Biggest FanaticMusslebob Buffpants {on commersial they said Squarepants instead}bonus episodes:I'm with StupidSquid on StrikeThe ditto part was Ripped Pants was on the first Spongebob DVD Nautical Nauncence and Sponge Buddies, and Band Geeks was on the Spongebob Halloween DVD."
3,Good DVD... with exceptions...,"Yet another single-disc collection in the endless Spongebob DVD library. At my standpoint, collecting the season sets is much easier (Seasons 1 and 2 are available now, if you're interested), but if you've been collecting these discs prior to the season sets, then it's best to stick with these. Now we have ""Home Sweet Pineapple,"" a collection of 8 episodes. But, surprise surprise, Nick has started to repeat themselves. They've put on the disc ""Ripped Pants,"" which is already in the Sponge Buddies/Nautical Nonsense DVD, and ""Band Geeks"" which is on the Halloween DVD. Quite odd to put on the DVD two episodes that they've already released. So that's 6 episodes fresh to DVD, and with two more of these scheduled to release in 2005, we may be in for more repetition.BUT, if you're buying this out of the blue just to watch a little Spongebob, then these are some fine episodes, my friend."
3,Spanish: OUT,"I just hope that this is the english version of ""Home Sweet Pinapple."" If you press the DVD version, and press VHS tape version, it will go to spanish. I just wanted to make sure. This message is moslty for Amazon.com."
3,Ditto,"I realize I will only be repeating what Kim wrote but it bears repeating . . . I started collecting these before Nick was kind enough to release SBSP by Season so I am sticking with these compilation DVDs. Sadly, Nick has started to repeat themselves and has thrown ""Ripped Pants"" onto this release, which is also on Nautical Nonsense. Quite disappointing. I hope it's a mistake and not the beginning of a pattern."

3,Disappointing,"I bought this thinking it would be a good book for making the first child feel special once there was a second child. While I love God gave us you, this story is a bit confusing mathwise as it is God gave us two yet they end up having twins so it is really God gave us three. Unless you know you are having twins don't bother. Too confusing for the age group it is intended for. For a good book on the same theme with less confusion try ""All my favorites."" There are three bears in that one but it makes sense."
3,Surprise Ending,"Our son has ""God Gave Us You"" and enjoys the book (as do we) so when we learned we were expecting a second child, we thought this would be a great preparation book since it is an extension of the characters in the book we already have. What we weren't expecting is the outcome of Mama Bear's second pregnancy: twins! So, as ""Little Cub"" says, the book is really about ""God Gave Us Three"". The story leading up to the finale is good, we just wish we had known that it was going to discuss twins as now we have to explain each time that we are only having one baby NOT two."
2,A disappointing follow-up,"Although our family really enjoyed ""God Gave Us You,"" this sequel -- designed to help children cope with the arrival of a younger sibling -- disappointed us. While the illustrations are just as warm and clever and appealing, the text lacks the emotional warmth of the first book. Perhaps this is because it cannot be as much a sheer celebration of birth as the first book, since the audience is the child who may feel apprehensive about a newborn's birth. There is also a needless ""plot twist"" at the very end that serves no purpose, and even undercuts the rest of the book's message to some extent. Not recommended -- just talk to the kids you already have about how your love for them will not change, and then read ""God Gave us You"" to the newborn as well!"
2,Gaudy Illustrations,"Unfortunately, the illustrations in this book were a little mediocre with overstimulating designs and clashing colors. The borders are too busy, and the art quality isn't consistent throughout the book. I personally prefer simple pictures for little kids.The theme communicates the sanctity and value of life in a Christian way, (which I love) but the plot and story are a little all-over-the place. As an adult, I smiled at the ""surprise"" ending, but I could just see my child being SO disappointed if I just have ONE baby next time.This would be a good book for a family having twins, but I would skip it otherwise.Thank you to WaterBrook Press for giving me a copy of this book for review."
4,Beautiful Story of a Coming Child,"God Gave Us Two is a beautifully illustrated story of a polar bear family expecting their ""Two"". The older child wonders what life with the baby will be like and the theme that children are a blessing from God runs strong through the story. The big sister asks the questions that I think most kids ask: What if I don't like the baby? What if the baby doesn't like me? What if the baby cries too much? Each question is answered gently and kindly with reiteration of the blessing of a new child. The illustrations are beautifully done and can tell much of the story on their own.This is a great story to share with your young children the idea of a new member of the family on the way. I know we're enjoying it!"
4,Toddler Expecting a New Sibling?,"If you have a toddler and are expecting a new baby, reading ""God Gave Us Two"" might help prepare your older child for the new arrival. Lisa Tawn Bergren writes how Mama and Papa polar bear explain to Little Cub that she will be a big sister to a new baby soon. In words appropriate for children aged 2-5, the parents reiterate to Little Cub that God's blessing the family with another cub won't replace the love they have for her.The words ""God gave us you, now he's given us two"" are sprinkled throughout the delightful artwork by Laura J. Bryant to reassure Little Cub that there's enough love to go around for the whole Bear family. Any child soon to welcome a new brother or sister will delight in the story between these few pages, but if you're carrying twins, you'll appreciate the surprise ending.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
3,Missed the Mark,"Although the idea behind this book is a good one (teaching a first born child about accepting and loving a second born, and that the parent's love for the first born won't change) as I was reading it to my almost three year old son, I kept thinking to myself that they missed the mark. The line ""God gave us you. Now he's given us two."" is repeated far too many times for my liking, especially since at the end, there were not just two, but three children. Although I love that there is still a market for children's books that talk about God, this was not what I had hoped for. My son seemed to like it though, so I guess that's what really counts.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
3,Ok but...,"I received God Gave Us Two for free from the Blogging For Books program. We have read Lisa's books before and have loved every one of them.God Gave Us Two is about a polar bear family who is expecting another little one. The polar bear cub is worried that his mommy will forget about him when the new baby comes. However, it isn't just one polar bear baby that is coming it is two. This book really should have been titled ""God Gave Us Three"" since the mommy polar bear ends up having twins. Kinda disappointing since the title makes you believe that mommy polar bear is expecting only one. But on the other hand this is an excellent book to read to children if you are expecting a new baby. Mommy polar bear assures polar bear cub that even though there is going to be a new baby in the house that she won't love him any less.I give it 3 1/2 stars!"
5,God Gave us Two!,"God Gave Us Two is a book written by Lis Bergren for children who will soon have a new sibling. It is one of many books from her polar bear series, and her other books include: God Gave Us You, God Gave Us Love, and God Gave Us Heaven. This book tells the anxious story of young polar bear as she prepares for the arrival of her brother/sister. Throughout the story, mamma and pappa bear answer little bears questions about what a new sibling will be life, but they always end by saying, ""God gave us you, and now he's given us two!"" They promise that they will always love little bear just the same. My favorite part is the end though...where there is a pleasant surprise.I would highly recommend this book to all expectant parents who already have a kid."
3,Not as good as God Gave us You,This was still cute but definitely not up to the caliber of God Gave us You.
3,Twins??,I read other reviews so I knew to expect the twins at the end but what still disappointed. I hoped it wouldn't seem so akward.
3,An Okay New Sibling Book,"Definitely a cute story that was nice to be able to share with Emma--no stranger to the ""new sibling"" process. The illustrations were well done and overall I enjoyed the read. Spoiler alert, but one issue I did have with the book is that it's called God Gave Us Two--assuming one for the first sibling plus one for the soon to come sibling. But really, it's twins. So I guess the title still works in that God is giving the family two MORE. I can just foresee some confusion with a little one who is only welcoming one new sibling into the family. Otherwise, I was more than happy with the read.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
3,The book has a special purpose,"I love these books by Lisa Tawn Bergren, with their sweet, colorful illustrations of a polar bear family. This particular one isn't my most favorite, but it definitely has a special purpose. It is about Mama polar bear being ""with child,"" and the questions that Little cub comes up with:Why do you need a new baby?If we don't like the baby, can we send it back?Will she go iceberg hoppin' and puffin pouncin' with me?Will the new baby look like me?Will you forget about me?All of these are questions that a young child might ask when mommy is expecting number 2. It is a good book to share with little ones to help them accept, love and appreciate their new siblings.Disclaimer: Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers has provided me with a complimentary copy of this book for review purposes. The opinions I have expressed are my own."
4,Precious Story,"I thought this was a precious little story addressing the questions a child asks when they are preparing to be a ""big brother/big sister."" The same bear family that we loved in 'God Gave us You' and 'God Gave us Christmas' are now preparing to welcome an addition to their family... and find a surprise at the end!"
5,Mahler Symphony No. 8,This is an extremely enjoyable piece by Mahler. The format for a Symphony is differant...2 Parts...rather than 4 or 5 movements. The particular recording is extrremely clear and full of emotion. Highly recommend it to anyone who loves Mahler.
3,Good digital sound but recorded in Church,"Good digital clear sound but hampered by Church recording instead of the advantages of Concert Hall/sound studio. Good performances from singers and the finale is particularly strong as expected from most of Mahler's symphonies.Very difficult to find good modern high quality recordings of Mahler's 8thand this version from the Polish National Symphony orchestra, conductor Antoni Wit rates high on my list!"
2,Melted plasitc base,"The grill in the photo is one like mine with the plastic base. It is discontinued. After a year of use mine melted. I was cooking steaks with 7 or 8 bricks. I think the material broke down in composition and weakened after repeated use. The plastic base is no longer available in favor of a SS base. Since my grill was a gift I did not have a sales receipt. I contacted Cobb's customer service and after a few exchanges was told I was out of luck for any relief. My presumption is that the plastic base was discontinued in favor of the SS mesh base. Their has to be a reason Cobb made this change. I feel that cobb should have absorbed some of the replacement cost for their seemingly original defective design. The grill worked well, but I am disappointed in Cobb's response to my grill's material failure. At this point I am debating on whether I will purchase a new SS base or go back to my Weber."
5,nice...,"this set is for a toddler bed. The same matress as a crib. It plainly states that so I don't understand why the previous reviewer thought it was a twin..... but anyway, the bedding is very nice and a really good price."
2,"You're NOT in the Super Bowl,Charlie Brown","There are 2 things wrong with this title. 1:Charlie Brown isn't the main focus of the story,its Linus and 2:They NEVER go to the Super Bowl. Its a total ripoff. The moral is treated like an afterthought in this film. The animal football games are not only distracting and serve no purpose but the animation in these games are repetitve and the games themselfs are flop-sided with the birds winning by a large margin and the opposing team scoreless but however,they are still are fun to watch. The animation and some of the jokes are not great but pretty good. The romance between Linus & Melody is predictable,bland & phoned in a mile away. The cast are still themselfs and still fun to watch them do the things they do best. Overall,not the best tv movie but theres still a curtin joy coming from this film. Its a guilty pleasure to say the least. I give this film a 2 out of 10."
3,Not the best Peanuts ever,"This tape has its creative funny moments but, speaking as a big fan of Peanuts, it is not one of their best. It appears to have been a 1993 promotional release involving an oil company and possibly the NFL; the plot and production values are not at the level of the beloved Peanuts specials we all know."
3,Not too impressed,"I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS BOOK. Mind you, I was looking for some guidance on doing some life coaching and I have to say, it did not give me what I was looking for, It was too text book and did not venture out for the original ideas I was looking for. For some, it may be what they need - for me it just didn't do the job."
4,Solid coaching handbook,"The material is well written. It is simple, clear and comprehensive. Good value for money. Helpful to new and old life coaches."
1,not worth buying,"not a very well written book, chapter 2 talks about setting up your business - ah hello we just started talking about life coaching. But all you need to set up your business in the first place is a pen, paper were you can record details and a phone...come this is a very basic book.Many of the ideas in the book are not well explained. I suppose as a very basic book it might be alright but it's a rather grand title for such a basic book"
1,"BAD BOOK ABOUT THE SCAM OF ""LIFE COACHING""","If you suspect that life coaching is a scam, this book will do nothing to disabuse you of that notion. First, the book is horribly written, simple-minded small business ""tips"" haphazardly mixed in with embarrassingly trite power-of-positive-thinking ""insights."" Want to stop being depressed? Simply chant ""I am happy"" over and over again. In reading the book, you come to realize that one would need a roster of nearly retarded clients to have a successful practice. Basically, the book just pounds one point over and over again: Find out what your clients want, and then help them get it. There, I saved you 25 bucks."
1,Don't Waste Your time!!,Nothing new. Old material covered by other authors and speakers.If you have been in sales or HR services it will not benefit you.
2,Good resource in ways but one major flaw ..,"This is a helpful book in ways, great at pointing out some of the coaching tips that are useful, BUT, she states that you do not necessarily need to have a qualification to be a coach - this is so wrong - people who do not know what they are doing can do damage in coaching as in any field. It is these kind of people that give qualified coaches a bad name - I think it is such an irresponsible statement to make."
2,No easy transition to NLP in your coaching...,"There is no way this can be considered a ""Handbook"". It does not begin to compare with O'Neil's Executive Coaching with Backbone and Heart or Auerbach's Personal and Executive Coaching.If you're hoping to discover a way to integrate NLP methods into coaching, you're going to need a lot more than this book. I'm not sure exactly what audience I could recommend this to. There are lots of other coaching titles out there that are readable and enjoyable as well as informative. If you're not already well versed in NLP this one's certainly going to be neither."
5,First Class !,"After reading a few books, I was lucky enough to have this one recommended to me by a Performance Coach. I am so pleased that I got it, as I found it was to the point and clearly outlines what to do without and of the usual fluff. The second part of the book is filled with useful NLP techniques which can be used in a coaching environment. I would score this book 10 out of 10 and Ilook forward to seeing more from Curly Martin."
1,low quality,had it less than a year and its starting to break. the plastic is very low quality. construction is unreliable. it feels like its starting to loosen up and fall apart. i wouldn't recommend this product
4,"lightweight, but the basket is the sacrifice","pros: light weight, super easy to fold and unfold, handle 1in. taller than most(good for taller dads), built in carrying strap, comes w/weather cover and storage bagcons: almost non-existent basket, tiny parent center almost useless, therefore I am going to purchase a seperate stroller bag to attach to itOverall this was a good purchase for me because I live in an upstairs apt., so the lighweight, and carrying strap features were essential!"
4,Sick,"My title says it all. This CD is sick. Fantastic DJing. If you think reggae music means Bob Marley and Beenie Man, get life. Wanna know where hip-hop/rap music came from? The island of Jamaica. Reeeeeeespect!"
4,Makes great French Onion soup!,Not sure if it sets off my yeast allergies.... Flavor is good. People love the soup or gravy I make with it -even meat eaters! Can be a bit salty so watch the seasoning for your tastes and needs.
5,The BEST Latin textbook,"I have taught seventh and eighth graders from this textbook for over 12 years and this book has wonderful stories. It's emphasis is mainly on vocabulary and grammar. The Building the Meaning sections enforce grammar and it has declension and verb conjugation charts in the back, which are very helpful. The stories of Cornelius, Aurelia, Marcus, Cornelia, Sextus, Eucleides, Titus, Syrus, Geta, and many others are very interesting and make translating enjoyable."
1,"Weak on grammar, Strong on cheese","This book follows an illogical sequence of introducing grammar and requires many teacher supplements. Vocabulary is obscure (many uncommon words that are not useful in teaching derivatives to students) and limited to specific story lines. The lessons are ""watered down,"" weak on exercises and explanations. Teaching sixth and seventh graders as well as high schoolers with this text, I find that they think the stories are very silly. Rather than adapted texts of history and mythology, the boring adventures of the Cornelii do not inspire children to learn and to love it. Students taught by this method end up weak on grammar and thinking the text is goofy. I, as a teacher, agree."
4,bass,"the JBL 10"" is a great sub for great bass, especially at two Ohm!!! be carefull though these are easily blown with too much wattage."
1,Very Confusing Book,Very confusing and makes the reader struggle to understand what the writer wants to explain.
4,Decent Speaker for the Price,"I purchased these in 2004 and I must say that they provide a good quality sound for the price. The bass is tight and the highs are decent. I think that they actually look better with the grille off, but that is just me. I would recommend these for everday home theater use and stereo listening."
5,Nice presentation box,"I wanted these videos to complete my John Wayne Western collection. I've only viewed one movie but, the quality was very good."
2,"Very Good Collection, But Wish The DVD's Had More Features","If your a Duke fan like me, you will love the movies on their own merit. I am just not happy that the DVD's didn't have extra features like behind the scenes footage. Oh well, I guess I will have to live with that..."
3,"Product is best anywhere, but price is CRAZY","Our family loves this stuff. It's gluten free, vegan, natural, and it tastes fantastic. I use it for gravies, pasta sauces, rice seasoning and to flavor products like seitan (it's insanely good as the broth for this gluten-based homemade meat substitute, which is sadly off limits for us now that we're gluten free). It's pricey in stores but it's worth the price because the dishes taste so good.That said, the price here is utter craziness. I pay about $5 a jar at our local grocery stores and even then I grumble. I use it so often that I came here to see if I could get it cheaper in bulk. I guess I'll stop grumbling at the local prices."
3,Crash test dummy scene is disturbing,"The episode with the book Archibald Frisbee has a scene depicting how crash test dummies are used to test car safety and seat belts. The scene is rather graphic and shows what happens during a crash in slow motion for an adult dummy as well as child sized dummy and infant dummy. My 3 year old hide behind the couch and cried ""turn it off, turn it off"". Other than this one scene the DVD is fun and educational. I love Reading Rainbow and feel it is one of the best TV shows available to show children. I just don't care for the scene described."
3,Nice try. I hope next one from the author will be a better one,"Nice... I liked the way the author took Dan Brown's approach to mix in 'college lecture' into the storyline. Pretty slick for a new writer. He took the hint from ""Rule of Four"" that copying a best seller is good way to launch one's career as a writer. Storyline itself is interesting but... I wouldn't pay hard cover price for this book. I would pay Walmart $5.79 for a paperback if I didn't have any other choice. Even if you decide to skip this one, you are not missing much."
3,Average Retread,"After reading all the glowing reviews, I gave this book a shot. I'll admit it did keep me interested, but the characters and topics are retreads of better works.There's some intrigue, murder, manipulation, rogue agents, etc and the whole notion of odds/probability which is what originally attracted me... but the venture into the supernatural sea of quiddity (see Clive Barker) was unexpected (natch improbable) and can't touch stories by King or Koontz.The bottom line is the book kept my attention, but it isn't great. I'd recommend getting it on the clearance rack or waiting for paperback."
2,Not up to the promise,"I work as an economist and statistician and was excited at the idea of a novel using probability as a mover of the plot. Unfortunately, apart a few passages, the story is completely unplausible and uses statistical concepts just as a dressing. A complete disappointment."
5,Improbably good novel!,"I read Improbable based upon a suggestion from an Amazon friend, and I was not disappointed. Adam Fawer put together a fascinating story that combined Statistical analysis with medical mystery. His writing flowed very well, and there was not really dull moment in the book.The action in this book is very well written and almost non stop. The characters are well developed and interesting, and most importantly believable. From a rogue agent of the CIA to a Russian mobster running an underground poker game, all of these characters a vivid and full of life.For his first novel, I think that Fawer has hit a homerun, and I highly recommend this book to everyone!!!"
3,All over the Lot,This book is flawed. It tries too hard and misses. We have already seen this movie. His characters are unbelievable in the truest sense of the word.
1,The only thing Improbable about this book...,"...is that it got published at all!!! He thinks he can just slap one cliche on top of another to create a best-selling thriller? This is a transparently amateur effort with no redeeming value. Judging by the guy's diction, he could barely get a 600 on the SAT verbal. This is a total travesty. Trust me. I am a fellow Wharton undergrad alum and would like nothing more but to see another Wharton alum succeed in an endeavor that is not purely driven by profit motives."
