5,perfect,"i bought this chain for my father to go with an old pocket watch he bought. It was a perfect match. Not too shiny, just what he wanted."
2,Short video,"It has some effective stretches, but right when you think you're getting the hang of it, the video ends in less than 30 minutes!!! And the worst part is that the actual video content is only about 15 minutes. The guy repeats the same stretches on one shoulder and then the next. I paid almost $40 for this DVD and I am a bit disapointed now."
2,Wish it was longer,"Excellent exercises, what there are of them. The video is very short and only includes a minimal number of exercises. I wish there were a few more because the ones on the video are very effective. For the price, I expected more variety."
2,Why is there a single for this song?,"The Fonz was the only song I didn't like on their CD and they made a single on it. If anything, get it for the live performances of Walkin on the Sun and Disconnect the dots, if you don't have Fush Yu Mang."
2,lack of scent,"I didn't think this soap smelled anything like the ""melon pear"" it is named. It just smells like soap. I was disappointed as I love french milled soaps.Donna"
3,Filler Item,"I added this to my order only to be eligible for free shipping. I must say I was surpirsed to see this delivered in a somewhat regular size amazon package, and the soap well is quite tiny. Nevertheless haven't yet used the soap, so no comments about it."
2,lovely,yeah so i ordered this for my lady and i received it on time which was awesome. But when opening the box i come to find that this bar of soap was wrapped in like plastic wrap which didn't bother me. but to find that the one side was open....Come on. What is that? It was opened as if someone opened it and took it out and then put it back in. Not to mention that the bar of soap banged around in the box and then left abrasion's marks on the soap. When i went to see what it smelt like. the smell faded and smelt more like the box itself. Of course if i wanted my lady to smell like a box i would of placed her in one for a few days. I gave it 2 stars cause im sure she would of loved this thing if it was wrapped up nicely. but now she wont cause its just junk now. Also not to mention for anyone out there wondering how big this is...its an 1' 1/2 and is 1' total. so yeah its not the size of a regular bar of soap. So basically i wasted my money on this. o well.
4,so so,"I purchased this even though it was little expensive as a small soap. Smells very strong, really smells of grapefruit. I haven't tried using it yet, so not sure if this really cleans dirts."
2,Would not purchase again,Scent is a little overwhelming. Just purchase to fulfill free shipping requirement. Would not purchase otherwise. I love the scent of gardenias but this didn't come close to a gardenia scent for me.
3,Soap not exactly what I expected,The travel soap was quite small and I had expected it to be somewhat larger. Also I had thought by the description that it was all natural but it has some additives which I didn't want. The fragrance and texture of the bar is nice and enjoyable.
3,Small but powerful,Its smells great however I thought it was kind of over pricedfor one TINY bar of soap. Although I am not in the soap businessso I do not know.I will use it to put in one of my clothing draws.
2,Uhhh...,I haven't used this soap yet. I only bought it to fulfil the $25 requirement to get free shipping. But on the up-side it smells really good!
2,Itty Bitty Soap,"I have to say that although the fragrance and quality of the soap is good, this is an incredibly small bar. Its no more than 1.5"" long.Not feeling like its a very good value."
2,not a value,"this soap is everything it says, however closely read the description of size. it's a very small bar"
3,Mistral Soap,"The picture makes this soap look the size of a normal bar. It's actually very small, smaller than the palm of my hand. The smell is great but be aware of the size."
3,not bad,"I was irritatingly 3 cents short of free shipping, so I found this to be the cheapest to get it over. A bit over priced, though. It smells decent, but a bit too perfumy. At least in its unopened package. And when they say travel size, they mean it. But it looks nice and will make a good stocking stuffer.."
1,Growing up girls,"I belong to a family of four, and myself and my wife are the parents of two girls who are about to enter the teen age. I have to say that the book has been a real disappointment for, according to my opinion, only incidentally does it address any real-life issue we as a family encounter today with our girls or are indirectly exposed to through the experience of friends who are parenting as well. I believe there is a excessive stress in explaining female life or what revolves around it with sexist theories of society.I consider our family a rather open family culture-wise having had the opportunity of living in different countries, including the US for almost two years in a very traditional american mid-west town of 30,000 people."
3,Caminantes,"Great songs on this CD, but the people who put this CD together recorded it really badly.... the songs sound lower and not as crisp as other CDs sound."
4,Al Atkins - 'Heavy Thoughts' (Market Square),"Co-founder and pre-Rob Halford - Judas Priest vocalist and front man. Almost worth his weight in gold. Almost as fantastic as this title's follow-up 'Demon Deceiver... Plus' (see my review). Tunes that I was most getting into were the head-banging title track ""Heavy Thoughts"", the heavy-duty ""When Love Steals The Night"", ""A Void To Avoid"" (also shows up on the previously mentioned 'Demon Deceiver... Plus' CD), ""Little Wild Child"" and the in-your-face ""Caviar And Meths"" (restored to it's original seven-minute length - wasn't this song initially on the Priest 'Rocka Rolla' lp?). Also thought Atkins did a fine job of covering the Everly Brothers song ""Price Of Love"". Not every heavy metal / hard rock musician is able to pull that off."
1,A book to pass on if you're a Marilyn fan.,"This would make a good fiction book... but as a factual book Marilyn it falls very short. I read this out of curiousity from the library, and I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did not buy this. There are so many errors in the timeline and such that I wondered if Mr Jordan did ANY research at all during the writing of this book.Some of the pictures are cute, but that's the best aspect of the book. If you love Marilyn and are a stickler for facts and the truth- don't bother with this book."
3,"Ted, not so sure","He was really smearing her in this book. He said that she talked dirty and slept with him just to get to her uncle who broke her in the business. He said all this stuff like her uncle slept with her in exchange for pills he could get her later. He told of all the times she talked dirty and said, "" I want to sleep my way to the top!"". What kind of person would say that? Not Marilyn, Marilyn was innocent and like a frightened child, in a woman's body. She had problems but was loyal to her friends life long. ALl this guy care about was bragging about it and spreading gossip. It's more of a look inside of him, a dirty mind."
4,Norma Jean: MySecret Life With Marilyn Monroe,"I have read this book when it first came out. As I know Ted Jordan (Eddie Friedman) He was a great guy, his father was the brother of Ted Lewis. Knowing he was acting in Hollywood during the period of time in the book, I do not doubt the verasity of the book. I think it is well written, and my wife and I both enjoyed it. We feel that the wild ""goings on"" back in those Hollywood days are well documented in Ted's book."
2,on my shelf,"This book isn't as useful as the other book that I bought about movement through awareness. This book remains on my shelf after I tried to read it, I didn't quite find it helpful as the other book I purchased."
2,STICK WITH COUNTRY SHANIA,"Shania Twain is a very gifted artist but now that she is trying to impress all of these international audiences (Canada excluded) she is losing her true roots. She may be getting fans all around the world, but she is cutting off the ones here in the state. Please, Shania, stick ot country music, it's what you're incredibe at."
2,Not what I expected,"PErhaps I didn't read the description closely enough, but I thought I was buying a collection of writing prompts for high school students (rather than the cutesy ones used for middle school). This is meant for teachers who are studying the text ""Inside Writing."" Even then, it's a little trite and obvious."
2,Poor cues,I'm used to Kathy Smith and Michelle Dozois and I was just looking to try out some different instructors to mix it up a little. Well the cueing seems to occur almost half way through the step(s) which makes it difficult and frustrating to follow. Unfortunately dissappointed :(
5,Love it.,"I use this on my horses as well as my german shepherd who has dry skin and allergies. Works great, smells great..."
5,Replacing the game for a friend.,"The game is exactly what I wanted. My friend had the game and his toddlers destroyed it, so I was just buying him a replacement."
5,Marvelous!,"Gold Edition is the way to go, im not even sure why they would sell the original version now. This game is like a beefed up version of the Xmen Legend series with a wide variety of characters from the marvel universe we love and hate, im talking about you Loki, you deceiver! Ultimate Alliance made me feel like i was in the comic books. You will want this version over the original just for the extra heroes and villians like the hulk and venom. With so many characters to choose from and each with different abilities there is plenty of replay value even after you have beaten the main campaign. You can play online with friends or offline. There was a lot of love put into this title, once you play it you will understand."
5,Marvel RPG is top notch,"Ultimate Alliance is simply a *must play*. The super heroes come already pretty super but they get better and better over time. Unlocking new uniforms is very worthwhile because they have different attributes. Playing the training missions grants additional bonuses. Basically, each aspect of the game is there for a good reason and adds replayability - great for any RPG."
4,Comic Lovers Game,This was a great game. The team game play is great you can switch between each of the 4 characters that all have unique powers and moves you can use against the enemy and with so many different characters to choose from the gameplay is always changing depending on your team. The in-game video sequences are great and if your a comic book geek like me all of the character history and storylines are from the comics and fun to play in and be a part of.
5,Great Fun for Multiplayer,"This is a good game for multiplayer. The character development is pretty nice and the customizable costumes is a good touch. Well reccommended for buying even though noone really plays it on LIVE anymore. Good for LANning. And..........you get the hero and villain pack, and i am a big favorite to Nightcrawler."
3,Fun game with great characters,"My husband and I play with game with the help of our 4-year-old. We love being able to change the charaters and checking out their special moves. Sometimes the perspective makes it hard to see what was going on. It can also be difficult to keep track of where your character is when you have more than one player playing. The game provides hints and direction along with way, but not too much to make the game too easy. Overall a very enjoyable game."
3,Good for my 9 year old Marvel Fan,"Great for kids, but as an adult, I prefer the more ""open-world"" type games like Web of Shadows and Force Unleashed. This game was released 2 years prior to those, but I found the gameplay ""crowded"" trying to manage a team of 4 superheros onboard a ficitonal ""helicarrier."" I prefer a focus on one character and better character development in a game. Also, upgrades menu is somewhat difficult to figure out. Why??? Game creators could've done a lot better with that. I haven't finished the game yet, but after a few levels, it's moderately fun and entertaining. My kids love the fact that they can be any marvel hero or villian they want. Doctor Doom, Magneto, Hulk, Iron Man, you name it!"
2,Got bored real quick,Ive played all of the X-Men Legend games and loved those. But for some reason I cannot get into this one. Ive tried playing it about 5 times and get about 20 mins. into it and get so bored I have to turn it off. That and I had a buddy that bought this for PS3 and I even tried playing it with him and we played for about 30 mins. and he said the same thing. I read all the reviews before I bought it and was really pumped up about it and was sadly disapointed. Not enough fighting for my liking. I really dont see what everyone else sees in this game. I really wanted to like this game because im a big Marvel fan. Thankfully I bought this for $10 in the bargain bin. Not worth the time.
1,Speak Korean?,Don't purchase this unless you speak Korean! Can't tell what's for what... and it smells a bit girly. Bad purchase for me.
2,There are only wonderful basslines in it,"Do you want to understand what some people call ""emo-core""? Listen to the (only) Crownhate Ruin LP. One song can get you excited (I would recommend ""Stretched too thin""). But on the long run this LP is annoying: the voice is shouting to the irritation, guitars are elementary and sharp. But listen carefully to the bass!! The sound is deep, doughy... the lines are funky, filled with notes... I don't know why the producer keeps it often in the background. This could be the only reason to buy this album. Anyway, the bass player's name is Fred Erskine. So why don't you simply listen to June of 44 (especially ""Four Great Points"") to listen to the greatest bass player in circulation? If you are addict to late Dischord-sound you own it already or you are going to buy it anyway. (And don't get angry, I were one too: I own this album and Fugazi still are my favorite group)."
4,"I liked it, but there was some damage","I love my entry way bench, but there was some damage to one of the pieces of wood. My guess is this happened during shipping so I can't blame NetRush for this. The piece of wood that was damaged was on the side that would have faced the front door, so we changed the wall the bench backed up to, so now it faces the other way. Since it was only one piece that was damaged, I thought this solution would be easier than shipping back the piece and waiting."
3,Good product but overpriced.,Product worked fine. Pricy though through Amazon. Got more from local True Value hardware store for a fraction of the cost.
1,Just not worth it,"You supposedly get 12 ""7 day trial packs""--so with this purchase from Amazon, in theory, that's almost 3 months of product. Each 7 day trial pack might last maybe 3 days. The tiny bottles are small to begin with, and they are difficult to deal with. Next time, I'll just go to Wal-Mart and buy the one month kit that is packed so much nicer, and easier to use with the tops on the bottles that keep you from dumping the entire contents of the bottle at once. Bad deal."
2,Disappointed,"The product package shows ""7 Day trial"" sticker on the front of the box. When I peeled the sticker off the box it shows that it is actually only a 3 day trial package. I found it to be very misleading and will think again before purchasing anything else from Amazon."
5,Song of the year,"Altough I'm not a big Take That fan, this song brings me back to the time when pop songs were pop songs. There's good set of lyrics, even better, great melody and on top of that - listing to the song just makes you smile ! Well done Mark - wish there was more stuff like this coming our way."
4,Great fun!,My son who is ten months LOVES this book. He is very curious and loves to touch and feel EVERYTHING! There was only a few things that I found wrong with it. The page that has scratch and sniff flowers doesn't really smell. Also the page with the mobile on the string can be easily pulled off. Even with that said I would still recommend this book to all the curious babies out there. My son loves it!
2,There are better books out there,"I was very disappointed by the low quality of this book. The pictures are not as good a quality as other books and textures available to feel in the book is very limited. There are so many great touch and feel books on the market I would recommend other books like the ""That IS Not MY..."" series by Fiona Watt."
5,They love it!,We are on our second copy of this book. The grandkids loved the first one so much we had to buy a new copy for the newest grandchild!
5,We love this book!,"This was my son's favorite when he was an infant. He loved all the pages, especially smelling the flowers and opening the doggy door. Since then I have bought it for many other babies I know. I think it is adorable."
4,"Cute but pompom is choke hazard, sniff doesn't work","It's a cute book and my son enjoys it. But the pompom on the cover is a choking hazard. It seems to be glued on very well, but my 1-year old son managed to yank it off and of course it was headed for his mouth (but I was right there so no problem.) And scratch and sniff doesn't work. I peeled the label but there is absolutely no scent underneath."
2,A woman's pain,"""Yerma,"" the play by Federico Garcia Lorca, has been adapted by Pam Gems in the version I read. Gems also wrote the introduction to the book, in which she praises Lorca as one of Spain's greatest artists of all time. A note before the beginning of the play notes that this adaptation was first presented in Manchester in 2003.The title character of Yerma is a rural wife who is frustrated because she has not yet given birth to a child. The play follows her conflict with her husband and interactions with other characters. ""Yerma"" certainly raises some important issues: marriage, gender roles, motherhood, trust, and honor. And there is some wonderfully poetic language. But overall I found this play dull and uninteresting; moreover, the characters never really engaged me. For better examples of Gems' talent, I suggest the fine plays ""Marlene"" and ""The Snow Palace."""
5,If...,"If the next dancing school is out of reach,if you have difficulties to remember what you have just learned in your dancing school,if you want to add pimento to your salsa, these DVD's are for you. The teaching is clear, detailed,easy to follow and a delight for the eyes and ears."
3,Good moves and instruction but poor production,"This was a new dance style for me and my wife and we liked the moves and instruction but the DVD production is terrible. Every dance step has several menus to navigate and each item has a several second intro with the same theme and music which gets really really annoying and time consuming when you are trying to quickly learn and repeat the steps.A good DVD production is the Salsa one from Raul & Tenia. There is only one menu with the patterns, you click on the dance you want and you are there."
5,at the top of my hip hop sleeper list,"I should have wrote this last year when I got it, but when I first hear this cd I thought is was ok(some of my favorites started out like that) A while went by before I gave it another chance and then I really heard it. This one made me a L.L. fan but it's a tough act to follow. These guys have a style that goes back and forth from West Coast flava to underground hip hop feel. Lyrics are always serving the song and theme/story. They're not talking about how dope they are like everyone else, they just show you that they are with raw talent and sick beats that sound original and song writing that made this one of my favorite cd's. It's nice to have someone repping the West again like this and putting us on the map. It's a sleeper so give it a few rounds before you call it."
4,G&E is tght !!!!!,this is a super dope cd my favorite track is can't catch me it has the sickest beat in Hip-Hop history. in my point of view I think it's better than G&E vol-1-2 it also has super number one flows another phat track is the clap and emotion do yourself a favor grab this cd before it's out of stock or out of print....
3,average,its ok but theyve done betterit seems the skillz have not left the duo on this album but the whole cd is lightweight in comparrison to gne vol 1.2.
4,"Good, but the track listing is wrong","amazon is notorious for not having the correct track listing for cd's, so here it is:01. Intro02. Road To Road (feat. Jo Wilkinson)03. Everafter04. Just For You (feat. Bicasso & Basik)05. Mr. President06. No More Greener Grass (feat. Pigeon John)07. Can't Catch Me08. The Clap09. Still Watching (feat. N8 The Gr8)10. Atlantis (feat. Scarub & Tiombe)11. Dr. No12. This Is Yo Life (feat. PSC, Aceyalone & Abstract Rude)13. Emotion14. Highwire Love15. Lake Release"
4,Well written OChem book,Got this older edition to supplement my OChem studies - also bought the solutions manual - it helps to clear up difficult to understand concepts. It is well written in easy to understand words and good illustrations.
3,ok,"The book was in an okay condition, but was kinda of beat up around the edges. Besides that the inside of the book was fine and it did it's purpose, I do recommend this book."
4,Panasonic VDR-D310,Received this camcorder very quickly and as advertised. Had a special occasion for which I wanted to use the camcorder and was able to do so without reading any of the instructions including taping and playback - the operation and controls were pretty intuitive. Haven't even played the DVD back yet on a TV but on the camcorder's LCD screen the images looked like they had a lot of contrast which may have been due to the relatively low light. Good sound and easy review of the recorded videos so that I was able to play the movies back to my wife to show her everything she had missed. Looking forward to using it more and exploring the camcorder's capabilities.
1,Bad Vedio Quality,"I've purchased this camcorder to improve my vedio recording from the miniDV camcorder (Panasonic 3CCD)but unfortunatily I got a very bad pics and vedio.I strongly recommend the miniDV Panasonic 3ccd and forget the DVD camcorders, the miniDV has a great vedio recording twith amazing colors and clarity. dont swich to DVD camcorders please !"
4,Good bench for the money,I got this bench as part of a home gym and like it very much. It waspretty easy to assemble and seems sturdy. The only concern I would have is it might not be great for my husband or son since they are much taller & heavier. It seems to be designed for a woman so it works great for me.
5,Finally a bench designed for women,"I am average height (5'6"") and have trouble keeping good form on some of the bigger benches that are really designed for men. This allows me to sit up straight and keep my feet flat on the floor so I can really focus on the workout and not getting steady on the bench. I love products designed specifically for women!"
2,Empower,"I ordered this item thinking that it would be the perfect bench to easily use and store away. It is also inexpensive compared to others I looked at. I like it because it suits me considering I'm petite -I would not recommend it to anyone tall or heavyset - and it's lightweight so I can move and fold it without a hassle. However, it's difficult to do certain exercises on it particularly if you have to lie down. My biggest pet peeve is that it came unassembled despite what the ad states. Apparently some people didn't have to deal with assembly, but I did and it took hours to do. The instructions are crude pictographs and I had to improvise in areas. Fortunately for me it hasn't collapsed and I've used it several times already. Overall it was a good purchase to start - further along I will probably upgrade to a different bench."
2,Broke after 2 months use,"I had this bench for two months, and all of a sudden the metal bar that keeps the bench upright snapped off and broken (almost got injured). I have another bench that I have been using for over year and never had that kind of problem. The em10 is decent quality but it's not built for durability or stability. Overall not worth it in the long term."
4,Good value,"I really wanted to get the Bowflex version but really didn't want to pay almost double the price for something I might not use as often. It pretty much is as described and looks but the only downside to this bench is that there really needs 2 more settings on the incline. I had to go buy a metal piping and rig it to the bottom post to get the 15 degree grade which is a good position for bicep work.Overall, it's good for the price, but I probably would pay the extra $80 in hindsight for the Bowflex since it has all positions of incline and it looks better to boot."
3,Think twice on this purchase,"Not really a bad value, although it would be a slam dunk if there were a couple more incline settings and the seat could be raised. Also, if you're 6' or better (as I am), you're going to find the bench is shorter than you'd like. This is a tough product to buy online - it takes a few uses to test it out and by then it's too much trouble to return. I'll use it until I can find a better one at a yard sale."
2,Eh,"I can keep this relatively short for those of you who don't like to read novel-length reviews. I had VERY high expectations for this album, from listening to ""The Music That Died Alone"" to hearing all the rave about it on this site. So I was pretty eager to listen to it after it arrived in my mailbox. And what I discovered was GREAT music, and HORRIBLE vocals. I'm sorry- every time Andy, and the others sing I shudder. What a juxtaposition to have excellent music spoiled by horrid vocals. I typically like and can stand singers that get bashed quite a bit (like Geddy and James Labrie) but this? No. Fantastic, rock, jazz, fusion sounds are throughout, but the singing just doesn't cut it. 2 stars."
5,Fun!,"My 11yr. old son bought this for my 7 yr. old son. He loves it, so do all his siblings( that are old enough to play)It's nice because unlike monopoly it doesn't take forever to play a game. All the player cards are older, not current, NFL players. This was wrapped well and didn't appear to ever have been played."
4,Historic Mozart Requiem,"Back in LPs early years, there appeared in a boxed set of 10"" discs, the Mozart Requiem, conducted by De Sabata, and with the operatic luminaries of the day, Tassinari, Stignani, Tagliavini, and Tajo singing. Something tells me that it was recorded on Cetra Soria, but maybe that's a leap. The performance is first rate, the remastering is surprisingly well done for a late '30s performance. It is a truly inspired performance, and worth having no matter which modern performance and recording you may also choose to have."
3,Another street soldier talks,"This is another Italian mafia book from a street soldier's point of view from him doing well to being almost beat to death. Wiseguy is a better street soldier book, but this is good and it is worth reading if you have some free time. Always some action going on."
4,A must read for true-crime lovers.,"This book gives an excellent up close account of the life of a mobster. It tells, in his own words, of his high and low points of his affiliation with the mafia. This a facinating story. Joe Dogs is one you won't be able to put down."
3,The Birth of Go-Go,"There is one song on this CD that I had to have because it has been sampled in a couple hundred rap songs. Other than that, this is early Chuck Brown before we had any concept of how transformative go-go music would be in the DC area. If you want to get a sense of early Chuck Brown music pick it up. Most of this sounds like old 70's blaxploitation pimp music funk."
2,WEAK !!!,"I'm very disappointed with this level!I bought to use when I'm on scaffold. It fell off the first day ,almost hit coworker! Not safe ! I have refridgerator magnets that are stronger. NOT worth the money. I'll pay and get the stabilla this time,I'd rather pay more and have it work!"
3,KitchenAid mini processor,"It does the job it was meant to do, albeit a bit noisily. The hole at the top for adding liquids should have been a bit more generous. The same goes for the slit meant for the addition of dry ingredients. The blade is sharp and does the chopping fast. I would like to see an additional type of blade or two made available to do different jobs as the full size processors have."
2,Works great while it works,"This product does an excellent job of chopping everything from nuts to cheese. But, after only a year and a half of light use, it quit working. The blades still spin, but it no longer is capable of chopping anything. So, unless you are fascinated by spinning blades, it is useless. Not a good life cycle for an appliance."
4,almost five stars,"I give this little guy four stars for being functional and attractive. It's great for chopping onions, pureeing tomatoes, crushing Oreos for ice cream (yum!) or pie crusts. It is small, so if you plan to cook for more than 1-3 people, you may want to move up to a full-sized food processor. However, for small jobs, this is simple to use, easy to clean, and takes up very little counter/cupboard space."
1,Mistake,"Don't use liquids in this product, because it will go all over your counter! For the price it shouldn't leak. It also doesn't have adjustable blades for ice like some other food processors. You must hold a paper towel or cloth over the top to prevent things from getting out, inconvenient and messy! I sincerely regret purchasing this product. :("
2,"Worked well the first two times, but then it broke.","I purchased this chopper primarily for pureeing tomatoes, chopping onions, and other simple stuff like that. I used it twice, and when I got it out the third time, it wouldn't work. The problem is the built-in safety lock. You have to lock the cannister onto the base, and the lid onto the cannister in order for the unit to turn on. Well there seems to be a problem in the mix, because the cannister/lid combination won't depress the safety button far enough. Unfortunately, I've had it for 60 days, so I'm beyond Amazon's return/exchange policy. I tried calling KitchenAid warranty service, but haven't yet been able to get through.I'm a big fan of my KitchenAid stand mixer, but everything else I've ever bought from them (this, a blender, and some kitchen utensils) has failed. All seem to be quality control issues."
2,Central plastic rod melts/warps,"The central plastic rod melted/warped one of the first times I used this product and now I have a very hard time getting the chopping blade component on and off. Also, it is really loud."
1,Form Over Function,I've had at least 3 of these and they don't last. The motor burns out quickly. I'm an experience cook and know how to treat my equipment so I have concluded that this chopper and many other KitchenAid products are poor quality (gone are the days of the amazing Hobart motor!) packaged with a high-quality look that is deceiving. It took me awhile to catch on but I've finally learned my lesson. My KitchenAid days are over.
1,later regrets,After trying to use this several times.....absolutly frustrating.....no more.....would never reccommend it to anyone!! At first I thought I could figure it out...no instructions came with it..........but that didn/t work either....it was hit and miss....mostly miss. I would definitely NOT reccommend it ...at least this brand
3,Loud. Didn't cut up 1/4 of a med to large onion after I quartered it.,"I found one of these, brand new, still in the original package at a garage sale. I haven't had one of these in years because I figured I could cut anything up just about as fast as one of these once I figured in the clean-up time. I was right. However, I won't even tell you how cheaply I purchased this. It was fun to chop up an onion (I'd already quartered it). And clean up was nothing more than hot water, a sponge, and some liquid dish detergent. However, I quartered and pealed the medium/large onion before I put it into the chopper and 1/4 of it got stuck and didn't chop. The rest of the onion fine minced. It seems to have a hearty motor. However, being a bit old fashioned, I think I'll keep it around for the husband and keep mincing stuff with my own knife. Okay, I paid $3.00 and it was the model in red. The fact is that the previous owners had gotten two as gifts and were moving."
5,"Little, ....BUT A BEAST!! :D","So Compact, & just gets the Right things Done! If you don't JAM everything in, & Understand the ""3-Cup"" Limit. You'll LOVE IT!!"
3,Loud and You Have to Hold the ON-OFF Switch During Operation,"I was disappointed in this product because you have to hold the on-off switch to operate it. If you let go of the switch to do something, it shuts off. It's also extremely loud when running, and because you have to hold the switch down, your hands aren't free to block your ears. It's attractive, but the clear plastic it's made of feels cheap."
4,GREAT---but beware of handle!!!!!,"This is a FANTASTIC food processor...small and very powerful. BUT---the handle has several openings, pretty stupid design...because water AND food get trapped in there and it very hard to get out. I keep a can of compressed air in the kitchen, with a straw that goes into the spray part of it (like W-D 40) and rinse out the handle with a blast of hot water, then use the compressed air to dry it. That way, you dont have a chance of getting food stuck in there that you cant get out."
2,Horrible Horrible Engineering,The space between the blade and the plastic cover is where the chopper goes wrong. The chop is uneven and the veggies often end up stuck to the sides where the blades can't reach. The chop rate goes from blunt to broken bits....never a fine chop. the cuts are uneven and you're left with chunks of ginger or garlic. If only the bowl was shaped where it flows down instead of splattering all over.The bowl is too big when mincing a few garlic but too small when mincing a handful of veggies.
3,Easier to use than Cuisinart,"I really liked this chopper, it is easy to use. But the motor died after three years and I replaced it with the cuisinart mini prep. I liked my kitchenaid better, even though it didn't last. The canister and blade go on much easier than on my cuisinart mini prep. We will see it the cuisinart is more durable."
3,Impossible to Clean Adequately,"Here's what I hate about this food processor: outside of its capabilities as a chopper, it is impossible to clean. Our food processor collected a profusion of black mold material inside its handle and try as I might I couldn't put this supposedly contained collection of toxicity close to my food. We finally threw the thing away."
5,Great Chopper for Small Jobs,"This is the perfect chopper/mixer for small jobs. I use it to chop onions, garlic, herbs and vegetables for small jobs. Also great for quickly making salad and other types of dressings and rubs. Love this so much I bought it for a friend.The only thing you should be aware of is that you have to ensure the top mixing unit is properly aligned or the unit won't chop (for safety?). So, be aware of this when you purchase - if it doesn't work, no it's not broken, just not aligned."
4,Very useful,"I haven't used it enough to give it five stars, but I can definitely give it four. I got this as a wedding gift and it works great. After reading others reviews, I've realized that some people are not too smart. This is a FOOD chopper, it is not made for liquids. Thats what a blender is for. I used this little chopper for my holiday baking. It is great for chopping cranberries, they are just way too hard to chop by hand. All in all I would say its a great buy."
2,It was a great gadget--until it stopped working!,"Back in December 2011 when first purchased this item I thought this gadget was great. Used it about 15 times over the past year for small chopping jobs. However, about 1 month ago I tried to use it again and nothing happened. It was dead in the water. Have gone back to my kitchen knife!"
5,Kitchen Aid Chef Series 3 cup Processor,I am very happy with it. It does a great job for anything I use it for. Very easy to keep clean.
4,Great little appliance,"I love this chopper as it's the right size for my needs, matches my red other KitchenAid products and is easy to use."
1,cumbersome kitchenaid processor doesn't do justice to cuisinart,"THis unit seemed beautiful upon arrival...but it does not compare with cuisinart at all for food processing abilities. It is extremely hard to open the top - Even a young person has a hard time opening it let alone older folks. THe buttons do not easily start or stop the unit's function.I sent it back immediately. I thought about regifting it, but then thought someone would remember my ill-thought out gift for all eternity. Item that should work doesn't work at all.Kitchen aid I found is only good for one thing_ the big mixers."
1,careful,"Be careful when purchasing a KitchenAid countertop applicance. They could well discontinue it whenever they like. That happened to me with an 11C food processor. So now they will ""offer"" me a 30% discount on a new one (at bust-out retail) - ridiculous - or tell me to pound salt. So $250 is now worth less than the bowl. They did't make them and they don't support the parts (i.e. bowls, lids) for them. So be careful. They may leave you stranded if you buy the wrong one!"
2,this is great when it works,I bought the KitchenAid food chopper and I must say it works great when you can get it started. Most of the time it will not work when you press the start button. This is very upsetting when you have the food in it to be chopped and nothing happens.
3,Works but Horribly LOUD,"I bought the mini-processor for making bread crumbs and other small quantity items -- things I don't want to use the full-size Cuisinart for.Unfortunately, the machine is loud enough to cause hearing loss. I can't stand next to it without using earplugs and I have to warn everyone in the house so that no one panics when the high-pitched roar starts.Until I got this machine, the noisiest things in the kitchen were the coffee grinder and the full-size Cuisinart but this little monster is MUCH louder than both of them.Since the manufacturer's descriptions (and most reviews) rarely mention noise levels, I won't be buying another mini-processor until I can actually hear it running."
4,Cute little guy packs a punch.,"This tiny chopper does a big job. I'm pleased with how well it works, the ease of use, and the quick clean up. I've had my KitchenAid chopper for a year now. It continues to perform well.Only concerns I have are minor. It's loud, the handy compartments for adding wet or dry ingredients while mixing located on the top of lid can sometimes allow stuff to fly out, and the darn cord doesn't easily tuck away into the bottom of the base. However, these aren't deal breakers for me so I'm fine.I like this chopper. It's a nice size and mine is cobalt blue so it matches the kitchen. I'm pleased with this handy dandy little guy."
3,"Surprised, pleased and disappointed- limited abilities","KitchenAid blades are are differnt hights than traditional food processors. As a result it does an excellent job on chopping herbs, by not pureeing them and turning it to mush, which is great. However, these blades make it difficult to process small batches.For example if you put in 2-4 oz of yogurt and want to start a yogurt or mayo based dressing, not happening, so it's a huge disappointment for a mini food processort NOT to be able to do a mini job. The cup is to wide to get a hold of product in the bowl, the blades just spin around not really mixing anything! Overall if you have a good bit to process, ths is great, if not I have prefered the cuisnart and krups mini food processors, they do fantastic jobs on small amounts."
3,wasn't the same model #,the same model # was ordered because it was supposed to be as cheap as ordering just the bowl for my current one .... and it doesn't fit. typical capitalism .... forget about fixing or ordering parts for anything; JUST THROW IT AWAY CUZ IT'S CHEAPER TO BUY A NEW ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Works Well for Baby Food, Blades Get Stuck","We bought this to make baby food. It works really well. We use it for a lot of different things now that the baby eats regular food, like making bread crumbs, applesauce, guacamole, nuts for baking or pesto.The only thing wrong with it is that sometimes the plastic blade holder gets stuck in the middle. To fix that, I took two flat-head screw drivers and placed them under the plastic blade holder. I gently pushed and wiggled the screw drivers to pry the blade holder upward until it came loose. You have to be gentle or it can crack the cup. I'd stay away from touching the blades with the screw drivers so they don't become damaged. There isn't s lot of space for leverage in the 3 cup model.I like the lid. It slowly distributes added liquid while running the appliance, making it easier to judge the amount you need to add. The safety lock works well, aligns properly. The blades stop quickly when you let go of the button when using it for lighter chopping."
2,Nice...for a short while,"I love KitchenAid. All my major appliances are KitchenAid, and many small appliances, too. But this little chopper didn't make the grade. It worked just fine, but after only three uses, it was very difficult to get the cover on right to make it work. After a couple of more uses, it stopped working entirely. The safety switch issue is impossible to overcome. It was a poor design, and it's time they take this one off the market and redesign the switch so that it works for more than a few times. I'm not used to being this disappointed in anything made by KitchenAid. I ended up replacing it with the Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus, on sale for less than this one was."
5,5 years later - still the best!,"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT! After 5 years, it is still sharp, still runs great, is probably the best chopper on the market. If it dies tomorrow, I'm buying another one. What can I say, it's an awesome little tool that does what I need when I need it.For Christmas, I hope Santa brings the 12 cup big brother!"
5,Nice and compact!,"This chopper was recommended by a friend and I'm so glad I took her advice! It's a great little chopper. It's lightweight, doesn't take up much room, and does all the jobs I'd ever want a food chopper to do. My kids even have fun helping in the kitchen! So glad I added it to my kitchen."
1,Don't Buy This Mini!,"I bought this mini about 2 1/2 years ago. Didn't use it much until last year when I had to begin grinding up baby's food on a daily basis. The locking tabs broke off and then the handle's locking tab also broke off, rendering the processor useless. I called KitchenAid for a replacement bowl and lid and they wanted $26.00! After all it was past the 1 year warranty period...yeah right. It seems to me that this item should last more than 1 year at that price! This is not the only KitchenAid item I have had issues with either, but they have been good about replacing parts on those. This is the first time they have let me down, but I will NOT be buying anymore of their appliances."
3,"Serves a purpose, but quality is lacking","Personally, I don't think this is a great product. It does serve it's purpose as a small appliance to quickly chop an onion, but the plastic container is cheap and flimsy. I question how long it will last. I do have a 12C wide mouth processor from Kitchen Aid. The plastic on that container was thicker and within 4 months, it had severely cracked and I had to order a replacement.If you're looking for something that will quickly chop some things up (not uniformly), then this works and it doesn't take up much space. Just plan on replacing it relatively soon. And DON'T put the container or the lid in the dishwasher!"
2,Too loud,"I bought this item for making baby food. It does a great job making the food but is so loud, I try to avoid using it. The only time I have time to make the food is while my son is sleeping but this machine wakes him up unless I bring it to a far room in the house. I'd much rather be able to use it in the kitchen. I would not buy this again."
2,Button Problem...,"I got this item as a wedding gift. I didn't get to use it until a year after the wedding though, due to not having enough kitchen space for all the awesome kitchen stuff we received. Well, now that the warranty has effectively expired and I have been using this product for less than 3 months out of the box, the button doesn't work. Yeah, I know, super lame. I don't know why this issue hasn't been resolved on Kitchen Aid's end, but I wouldn't buy this specific machine from them again. However, when it worked, it was absolutely my favorite piece of kitchen equipment. But since I can't make the button turn it on, it's useless! And I can't return it since it's been over a year since purchase... sad story."
2,Suitable for very small jobs,Con on this product- you have to chop in such small pieces you might as well do it yourself and not have the hassle of clean up.
3,Food Chopper,"Purchased after very little product research. While the chopper does an excellent job, the safety features make it somewhat difficult to use."
1,Short - Too High?,"The MAJOR problem with this processor is the fact that the blade (that does all the work) is completely useless, as it ""spins"" nearly a full inch above the bottom of the cup! Small batches cannot be blended."
5,Love it,"We bought this because it matched out larger KitchenAid food processor and we were glad we did. It does a great job with small jobs like mincing garlic. It is plently powerful, easy to clean, and looks nice too."
1,kitchen aid chopper worthless,I bought this chopper because i had stomach surgery and had to chop food before eating it. I bought it online before the surgery so I didnt use it for about 2 weeks. After the surgery I waited 2 weeks until i was allowed to eat solid type food. The product worked great. next time I used it worked great. next time product failed. I figured out what the problem was. It has to many safety features and all are made of plastic. They are fragile and broke off thus making the product not workable. Cheaply made plastic that is over engineered for safety. I will return this one and not replace it.
2,Broke after 6 months,"The little button on the side that tells the machine it's okay to start working, broke after only 6 months of use. And it wasn't used daily either. I'm really disappointed. The KitchenAid stand mixer I have has been a serious workhorse in the kitchen, so I figured this would be too. Not so much. Don't spend the extra money on the name for this one."
2,it broke!,I absolutely loved this little food processor for 2 1/2 years. Last night I was pureeing some canned beans and the unit sparked and started smoking. I immediately stopped and unplugged it. I'm too scared to use it again!
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"This is the perfect small food processor. Not too small, but not so big that it takes up too much room in your kitchen! I have already used it several times, and it it super easy to clean. I reccomend this if you need a small food processor in your kitchen!!!"
4,"Lasts years, still works great","My bro. has had one of these for several years now (over 5 at least) and it has worked great. I made the mistake of trying to make a smoothie and added ice cubes which scratched the sides. This is definitely for food and not drink. However, what it does, it does very well. I recently bought one to replace his scratched one (maybe he'll give his old one to me :)"
1,Big letdown,"In the trash! The safety lock mechanism broke, and thus the unit will not run. Not what I expected from Kitchenaid! We got 3 mini choppers for our wedding, and kept this one, clearly a mistake. Go for the $20 black and decker, I gave mine to my dad when we got this one, he's still chopping everyday, and loving it!"
1,1st and 2nd both stopped working...,"I got this processor for a gift and after 2 uses it completely stopped working. My husband figured out that if you stuck a knife or small object against the lever on the handle it would work but we obviously were going to return it. We had the 2nd one for about 6 months and have used it periodically. Once again, it suddenly stopped working and would turn on only if a knife was stuck in the lever. The blade works great but the there is obviously some sort of technical issue with this thing if I have had TWO do the same thing. Time to switch to a Cuisinart."
3,Beware of suction and blades in combination,"First of all, it does its job well. I make smoothies, guacamole, hummus and chop veggies with it.What I don't like is that the center column where the blade sits in the bin is open to the outside. The inside of the blade piece is open. What happens is that liquid gets inside the column and the blade and creates suction. It is sometimes very hard to pull the unit apart to clean and I have cut myself a few times. It has to be carefully cleaned for the same reasons - gunk gets stuck up inside the blade piece and putting it in the dishwasher does not make it sanitary.I was hoping for something more carefree, which is why I did not buy a big food processor - I've cleaned those before. I still recommend this item, just be careful not to cut your hands if it gets wet inside!"
2,Disappointed,"This item worked in a pinch for Thanksgiving meal preparation. Since then the ""pulse"" button has been faulty. The button has to be pressed in certain areas to work, sometimes not working at all. I will stay clear from choppers with this type of button."
3,Looking for a new one,"I have had my chopper for about a year. I love it for making mayonnaise. Whips it up in about a minute. When my brother visited and had a sandwich with my homemade mayonnaise, he vowed never again to buy store bought mayonnaise. The big negative I have with this one is that when you submerge the container in water, bits of food get inside the handle. I didn't realize that would happen so there are rotting bits of food in the handle. Once it's in there, you can't get it out. That's why I'm looking for a new one. Some liquids will splatter out the top which I don't like either. It works well, just don't submerge the handle in dirty dishwater. Wash it before you wash anything else."
1,KitchenAid KFC3100,After one month of limited use the safety latch or pulse button will not allow the product to operate. I am returning this item.
1,"a moody machine, sometimes doesn't want to work","What a disappointment. I really wanted to like this machine for baby food making, however sometimes it just doesn't work. I mean it, sometimes it does not turn on, so my cooked baby food ends up in trash. I guess you cannot trust a machine for the brand all the time."
4,So close...,"I love almost everything about this chopper. It's reasonably priced, a nice size, and it does a good job with the chopping (my first experiment, chicken salad, was a success). It's easy to clean, the cord stores in the base, there's a slot in the top to add ingredients while mixing, and the little paddle is handy for scraping out the food from the bowl (it's a tight fit for one of those regular size rubber kitchen paddles). Another good feature: the chop button won't function unless the lid is locked in place.The one thing I don't love: the noise. I expected some noise with a chopper, of course, but this thing is so loud and *shrill* that it's almost embarrassing to use. It sounds sort of like a dentist's drill, times ten.So, we have four stars for this product. It does its job, it just makes a lot of noise doing so."
4,A Nice Well Built piece of Equipment,"Finally - a product that appears to be well made & works well. My only complaint (and it's not really a complaint - I just didn't know to expect this) is that when you chop items like onions or cucumbers, they get really watery."
1,very disappointed,"I ordered this product after my Little Oskar by Sunbeam finally bit the dust after about 15 years of constant use and I had trouble finding another. I ordered it based on other customer ratings and reviews. Am I ever disappointed . I ordered this chopper in November and the first one broke. (The shaft came up out of the machine with the chopping blade after trying to chop up a small amount of cheddar cheese!) I contacted Kitchen AId and they sent out a replacement unit free of charge and I sent the broken one back. This was in the first week of January. Now it is first of Feb. and I am preparing to send the second one back for the same problem. The shaft became stuck after chopping a SMALL amount of Monterey Jack cheese and came up with the blade unit again. I am pretty fed up. I also felt the unit was a pain to use in turning and locking on the chopping bowl , getting it on and off. This is definitely NOT the glowing little chopper that the reviews I read implied."
2,One function chopper,"I was very diappointed with this chopper. It has one on (pulse) button. You have no controls. I chopped onions which resulted in huge chunks up top and pureed onions on the bottom. I guess you can open and stir every few second but that defeats the convenience aspect of a chopper. It also does not hold a true 3 cups. The chopper is too small for use with a family of 3. It would be finely for chopping garlic, small amounts of herbs or such but not veggies.It was not useful for making chunky salsa where even chopping is ideal."
1,Would be nice if it ran...,Just disposed a brand new unit to my gaarbage can after using 3 times in 3 months. Locking mechanism will not drop in far enough to unlock unit so it will start. Not worth the hassle or the cost(shipping) to send back to Kitchen Aid. I thought the safety mechanism was suspect when I bought it bacause it is all plastic. Runs great when you stick a ball point pin into the safety switch. But then you can't get the cannister on when doing this. That's $10/use as I paid $30 at Target on sale. My knife and cutting board are working great though. Buyer beware.
1,An explosion and a puff of smoke,"I bought this chopper on Jan 27th and thought it looked a little flimsy, but had faith that it might work. On Feb 7th I tried bread dough in it. No kidding - there was a puff of smoke, a flash of light, and it died. I am taking it back to Target and getting a Cuisinart. Complete garbage."
2,Little Functionality,"I bought this on the basis of the other reviews & because it's little (I thought it would be easier to manage than my larger Cuissinart). I do like it's size but I don't like the lack of functionality. To be truly useful, it needs to come with other blades (or at least we should be able to buy them). Dissapointed. I would not recommend."
4,Not good for blending liquids,"I can not speak to its function because I never used the item. However, the item has several holes in the lid meaning if you are blending liquids it would splash all over."
2,"""Very Confusing!""","I did not enjoy this video as much as the other Kathy Smith workout videos that I own! It is very confusing and at times it leaves you frustrated and ready to give up! Yes, workouts should be challenging, but, not to the point where it leaves you feeling as though you are incompetent! This was not one of Kathy Smith's best workout videos! I would not recommend this video for someone who is a beginner!"
4,Great Workout,"This is one of the best workout DVDs that I have found. I have tons of workout DVDs, but this is one of the best ones. Kathy has energy but is not overly perky, the warm-up is good as well as the cool down and with the three diffrent levels you can test yourself and increase your fitness level."
1,Difficult to follow,"After using (and loving)the Gin Miller step videos, I found this video to be difficult to follow and it was a waste of my money. Kathy Smith seems to assume that the user already knows the steps and her cueing is too late. She needs to demonstrate the more complex steps and do more repetitions with fewer step changes. I found the camera work to be poor also. At times I was trying to watch what the legs were doing only to have the camera focused on the upper body only. At other times the camera gave long side views when front views were necessary to follow the steps. I've tried the video a few times and each time gave up in frustration and got out my Gin Miller tapes. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,"Does the job, but it's far to boring to be called ""power""","This tape definitely provides a good workout, but it lacks any kind of excitement. There's no complexity to the moves, and I don't find Kathy Smith to be an inspiring or engaging leader. I would not recommend this tape for anyone who's been stepping for more than a year."
5,Kathy Smith's Power Step Workout,"As always with Kathy Smith you can be sure of a great workout-whatever your level. I have been doing step workouts for many, many years and have quite a collection of videos. I always find myself returning to Kathy Smith for a workout that I can tailor for the level of intensity I want for that particular day. It is a workout suited for all levels."
3,Order of the moves are too complicated. Miss the point.,"I have bought four Jane Fonda and then decided to try something new. This VHS is nice but I like Jane Fonda's more. The moves in this VHS are not difficult. However, the ""orders"" of these moves are complicated so you need to put certain efforts in order to memorize them. For instance, usually a move includes two part. One starts with the left leg and the other with the right leg. Kathy sometimes teaches you both parts first but then takes only one part when combining it with other moves. So when your instinct tells you to do the second part, she already moves to the next move. She often creates a complicate set with a lot of moves and she does not allow the beginners to have enough practices of each move before actually combines them altogether. (In contrast, Jane Fonda usually does.) I feel the design of this kind of order is mainly for ""fancy,"" not for ""work-out"" so it is kind of missing the point."
2,An Uninspiring Video,"I bought this video because of all of the rave reviews here. Boy did I learn my lesson. This video was boring, inconsistent, and extremely hard to follow. I'm an avid stepper and this did not fulfill me. In places, Kathy gives no prompts and in other places, she gives them way too late. Save your money! Try investing in some Gin Miller videos."
2,"Bad sci-fi film is no ""Killers from Space""!","W. Lee Wilder, brother of Billy Wilder, directed this exciting tale of people sitting around and talking while an invisible space alien flees all who come into his invisible path. Unfortunately, this 1953 clunker is not as beautifully campy and tacky as Wilder's ""Killers from Space"" or ""Snow Creature,"" though it does feature some hilarious film-noir method acting in the person of a needlessly abusive cop who simply won't take anyone's word for anything. When the lead characters aren't sitting around discussing the obvious, they are running around outside and shouting the obvious. Perhaps this is some primal reaction to the unseen."
3,How To Make An Incredibly Average Sci-fi Movie... CHEAP!,"Step 1- Make the alien invader invisible, so you only need to show doors opening and closing, and furniture moving around to indicate the extra-terrestrial presence. Step 2- Hire unknowns. Step 3- Stock footage! Stock footage! Stock footage! Actually, I happen to like PHANTOM FROM SPACE just fine. It's an average little movie with a decent storyline. Nothing spectacular, but enjoyable enough. I like the idea of an alien who is just trying to survive on our planet, without wanting to destroy us. He's stranded here with no way to communicate with our species! He kills in self-defense, only to be branded a murderer. He tries to make contact, but ends up scaring people instead. This is by no means a perfect movie. There are some lengthy patches of boredom and silliness throughout. I still recommend PFS to all science fiction fans..."
3,Guilty until proven innocent,"This film stats out with the standard and fun 50's sci-fi formula. We ar treated to a thesis on the use of radar. Something foreign approaches Santa Monica (a beautiful beach community off the cost of southern California.) Then we are confronted by a stranger in a diving suite with pipes coming out of his helmet. It is only human nature that we should beat the snot out of him. But wait he defends himself. Could this deadly stranger have anything to do with the UFO? As he is tracked down and cornered by the authorities, he ditches his fancy suite and we are in for a surprise.Not as much of a shootemup as it is a study of physiology."
2,Substandard release,"Specifically regarding the DVD released by Alpha Video. The source print was poor and the DVD picture quality ranges from substandard to fair but the entire film has a soft image. Some segments are very soft with much surface noise. Dark scenes are very noisy and soft which is very distracting as they look like as if transferred from a worn VHS videocassette.So, only purchase if you are willing to watch a substandard image and don't bother buying if you have an HD screen."
5,Excellent Book,One of the best books on structural dynamics. The book contains all necessary material for building computer codes for linear and nonlinear analysis of structures under earthquake loads. It also contains several solved numerical examples.
1,Not What I Expected,"This movie set was not what I expected. This is a set of six older movies. The actual title of the movie set is ""The Best Of Great Outdoor Movies"". This is not the movie ""The Great Outdoors"" starring John Candy & Dan Aykroyd so don't be fooled by the misleading title like I was!"
4,Some pleasing enhancements,"At first glance, it's pretty similar to Quicken 2001. However, once you start using it, you'll notice lots of nice new features, particularly the way reports and graphs are generated. The biggest new feature is the new budget tool, which appears to have been totally rewritten from the ground up.Nothing amazingly new, just refinements. But I'd say worth [price]."
2,Dissatisfaction,"I have used Quicken Delux for 7 years, with updates to vers. 5.5f.Then I bought the Quicken 2002, and what a mess. There is adverisement for Quicken/Intuit products that take 1/5 of the screen, and they can NOT be removed. It was so annoying, I nwent to Money 2000 by Microsoft. Even though Money 2000 does not have the smooth performace of Quicken, it is a pleasure to use WITHOUT the annoying unmovable ads."
1,No longer supported,You can no longer upload bank information because the product is not supported. I could not register or use the software that I just purchased.
1,Quicken Basic 2002,"Quicken is the only software I have used to write checks and I have always liked and recommended it. With the 2002, I have found out you cannot use the CTRL-C and CTRL-L shortcuts when you are in a split transaction page. I use these two keys all the time because they are a time saver. I was told by Quicken support they are not usable in 2002. I returned the 2002 and went back to 1999 version."
1,Misleading Product Ended Up Costing More,Product was not full version as implied. In order to use it I had to call company and pay more money. Would never buy from here again.
2,Only For Accountants,"Not a real improvement over previous versions. It is still difficult to navigate, and complicated to do simple things. This software does not make accounting any easier than real accounting work. For a more simple, effective approach, check out Moneydance by Appgen Personal Software. It runs great on Windows (and even on Macs and Linux), and it imports Quicken files."
1,smeelll so bad,this one doesnt really work for me/.. this make my skin more sensitive.... smell not that ok... not recommend . .
4,Strong lavender fragrance,"The mist has a strong lavender smell that's very refreshing, but I wish it would last longer. Nice, cobalt blue spray bottle."
2,Difficult to search for topic,"This book was well rated, but I found it difficult to find any phrase that I was searching for due to the method of organization--You must know the exact wording of the complete phrase to find it, omitting insignificant leading words like el/la/ser or to/to be.I rarely found any matches to phrases I was searching for in this book. (Here is an example: ""lingering doubt"" is listed under ""L"", but you won't find anything like it under ""D""; or ""like trying to find a needle in a haystack"", also under ""L"" but the word ""Haystack"" is not even listed under ""H"". My old Spanish/English dictionary is much more productive as I can search a key word/concept and then find multiple ways of expressing or interpreting it depending on context. Otherwise, the hardback book is extensive in its supply of phrases."
2,Started out good,"Well . . . this book started out good. Talking about life values and what is the purpose of money in your life. However I started to realize that this book is geared towards people/couples that are planning on ""working for someone else"" for the rest of his or her life (having an entitlement mentality). And that's not the path that I want to take, I want the most out of life. I only got half way through this book (that's when I came across ""The Top 10 Distinctions between Millionaires and the Middle Class"").If you are a person/couple that plans to work for someone else for the rest of your life(lives) - then I would recommend this book to you.However like I said this book wasn't for me . . . once I started reading the other book above, I threw this book away (to be honest)."
1,I expected better advice,"First let me admit I did not read the whole book. As I sometimes do, I went to the table of contents and started with what I found interesting. In this case it was ""10 Mistakes Couples Make"" or something close to that. I was disappointed that the first bit of advice was to pay off your mortgage early. What a cliche, outdated notion.It doesn't take a CPA to do some quick calculations to figure out that if you invested that extra payment amount each month rather than pay down your mortgage, you would be light years ahead.This book may have other good advice, but if this is the caliber of advice this book has to offer, I won't waste my time looking for it."
5,Changed our Perspective,"My wife and I liked this book so much we used it in a workshop to get couples talking about their money, their values and their goals. Like all financial books, its only as good as its application."
5,Lovin' it!,"This book is one of the greatest books I have gotten my hands on. I am a newlywed and in my young adult-hood, I have decided that it is time to get my finances on track. I have taken my husband by the hand and we have now made it a ritual that every Wednesday we make time to sit down and plan our finances and our future together. We are only on the second chapter because we complete all of the exercises in the book. The author David Bach has a writing style that is simple, fun, imaginative and to the point. Every time I pick up the book I feel like I have my own personal financial advisor advising my husband and me. Getting your finances in order is a step by step process that requires the mind, patience, discipline and the willing to achieve. Check out what I have written in a year from now and I'll tell you how I am managing my millions!!!"
2,Self-Promotion,"Too much like an infomercial. It was obvious that the author had an agenda to get you to buy his other products and services.Many of the ""tips"" were not compatible with real life situations. For instance, the tip that suggests getting a 10% raise. A 10% raise or a raise of any kind is not possible in many cases in municipal, government, or union jobs: Raise hikes are cost-of-living and/or predetermined.I did like the ""Starbucks factor"". I don't think people realize how much money the spend weekly or monthly on the 'little things' like $5.00 cups of coffee."
5,Sound advice,"Money is one of the main sources of conflict among couples. The author of this book provides solid advice for couples about their money. He lists some myths about couples and money:* Myth No. 1: If we love each other, we won't fight about money.* Myth No. 2: It takes money to make money.* Myth No. 3: We don't make enough yet to be investors.* Myth No. 4: Taxes and inflation are under control.* Myth No. 5: If we don't talk about money, everything will work out okay.The author argues that almost everyone in America makes enough money to be wealthy. He says, ""The problem isn't our income; it's what we spend."" This statement is so true. It seems to me that too many people are concerned with having a bigger house, nicer car, or bigger TV. The more money people make, the more they spend. This is not a recipe for wealth.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
3,Guidelines for couples.,"I enjoyed the first couple of chapters of this book. This book would be a good start for couples that need to talk and settle their finances together. If you have not talked to your partner about your finances and need to start that discussion this is the book is your starting point. The author has a really good method of setting expectations for the future between couples and setting guidelines (9 steps) that can be followed during and after you create a plan. It is very important to at least try the authors method for I think they work. As for the rest of the book it is very similar if not the same information as other beginner investment books: how to set up a retirement plan, savings and checking accounts and all the basic items.Enjoy the book."
4,"good, but conservative, advice","This is an excellent book to use when planning your family's finances. Obviously, given the power of compounding, to which the author repeatedly refers, the earlier in your life you start planning for your financial future, the better off you will be. I recommend the book to anyone with the understanding that it follows a conservative, fairly conventional path toward financial security.If you are a finance whiz, you will find parts of the book too conservative and too plain. If you try to magnify your investment returns by trading options, for example, or you invest in real estate, or any other kind of investment other than 'plain vanilla stocks and bonds' you will find the book limiting.That said, the book provides an excellent organizational structure for any one trying to get a hold on his financial picture."
5,Great book!,Bought this after reading the great reviews. It is a great book that explains investing & building a financial future for couples. Thanks! Got a lot of great ideas from this book.
3,Automatic Millionaire for Couples,This book reminded me in a big way of Bach'sThe Automatic Millionaire: A Powerful One-Step Plan to Live and Finish Richalong with some fun remarks about marriage and planning things together. It was still a great reminder of all the great information and principles
5,All couples and parents should buy this book,Thank you David!This is a must read for couples who want to establish a solid financial future together. It is also full of ideas and principals that everyone should teach their children. A lot of future problems would be solved if all members of the family read this book as early in life as possible.Duane
5,No-nonsense solid advice,"I read ""Smart Couples Finish Rich"" after reading a few Dave Ramsey and Robert Kiyosaki books and I have to say that I much prefer Bach's no-nonsense and informational style of writing. Although all authors offer good advice and interesting case studies, David's plan is more solid and easier to follow. Other books are more story-telling than facts but this one is not, which is refreshing. The book is full of information and resources that make reaching your goal seem much more realistic. I loved it and am already implementing some of the steps. I feel more optimistic about my family's financial future and wish I had started saving sooner! This book is a ""must read"" for all couples, especially newlyweds just starting their financial life together. I also bought the single person's equivalent -- ""The Automatic Millionaire"" -- and gave it to my 30 year-old brother as a gift. I want him to start his retirement account sooner than later."
5,Very informative and useful,"As someone who was just learning the ""ins and outs"" of personal finance, I found this book to be very helpful. Mr. Bach explains the financial world in a way that is easy to understand and apply. He also gives you some good advice about what to look for in a financial planner. And he provides a multitude of sources you can turn to for more complete information.Most importantly, Mr. Bach really encourages couples to plan their finances together, which is something that not enough of us do. His model helps you identify your the things you care about most (he calls them values), and then plan your finances around those values. If you and your partner need some solid, simple guidance for personal finance, this book is worth the investment."
3,Generic Advice for the Risk Averse,"This is very generic advice if you need it. If you already have an understanding of economics, stocks, real estate, or investing, then you probably won't find this book very informative. Also, if you are interested in making money more aggressively, or taking advantages of higher risk investing opportunities, then you won't find the answers you seek here. If, however, you cannot balance a checkbook, find yourself not saving money, and want to avoid risk in your finances, then this book is for you."
5,Excellent Advice,"Regardless of where you are in life as a married couple, regardless of your financial situation, regardless of how much your income is or what your outlays are per month,if you even attempt as best you can to follow the advice in this book you cannot help but to dramatically improve your financial position in life. It is that simple. The money is always there. Employment is the only requirement to use the material in this book. Read, enjoy, and prosper."
5,Smart Couples Finish Rich,"I gave the book to two of my grandsons and their future wives, both couples think it is a great gift for starting their life together."
4,Live according to your values,"It's always best to know the author/teacher's background, and for Bach, he was born and raised a financial advisor. He lives and breathes this stuff. My husband is a CPA, and I...am not. However we both found valuable information to help us plan for our future and hopefully, early retirement. Some were obvious but Bach provided further insight. I appreciate his holistic approach to financial planning - use your money to support your values and the life you want to live now and in the future."
4,Good book,"I've liked all David Bach's books. This one was probably my least favorite, because it focused a lot on worksheets and dreambuilding, instead of the way to get the money set up. But overall, it was a good book and I'm glad I read it."
3,An unwitting portrait of how screwed up Victorian England really was,"This book is second-rate Trollope, but provides a first-rate look of what a Victorian mind is like -- from the inside. For in this book, Trollope seems to take for granted that primogeniture, female submission, and aristocracy are all good things, but Trollope is too good an author to permit his story to conform with his opinions: the aristocrats are largely fools; the eldest sons generally pale by comparison to their kid brothers; the women are almost all sharper than the men. Even so, the sense one gets reading this book is that Trollope approves of primogeniture, aristocracy, and the subjugation of women. It is almost as if Trollope has stretched outmoded Victorian morals as far as they can be stretched and it will take a pinprick to pop them altogether."
2,Cuisinart Work Bowl Cover,"Although I am very happy with my cuisinart products, this part was an incompatible part for my machine. I needed another cover that had a longer locking arm for the specific machine I own. I returned the covers and received a full refund. I then ordered the proper cover from Cuisinart in New Jersey."
5,An examination of power,"Borderliners is a disturbing examination of the nature of power and the way it can be manipulated. The surreal school setting focusses the reader's attention on events that many students may have naturalised; the ringing of bells, the concept of out-of-bounds, punishment, discipline and psychological assessment of students. In disrupting traditional notions of time and of the benign nature of adult authority, Hoeg is able to direct the reader into the world that exists outside of artificial, socially imposed boundaries. It is scary and dark but always a valuable place to consider. Borderliners positions the reader with those who are outside society looking in; it is a shocking experience. The multiple readings that are possible add to the intellectual and emotional impact of this book."
3,on the border beween timeless and interminable,"Peter Hoeg attempts to convey his perceptions of time thru structure by contrasting the infinite feeling of love with the mechanistic orderliness of a Danish school. His efforts to discuss social Darwinism via a diabolical plot to mainstream the troubled youth with the unfeeling majority stay in literary shallow waters. Hoeg finally must recogize his failures, because the book ends with a self-explanation, which, frankly, is more interesting than the novel itself"
4,School Time,"Perhaps Hoeg's character's ramblings about the nature of time are confusing, but don't let that deter you from reading a frightening book about school. Of course a school like this one, designed to remake children who are on the borderline of polite society, is itself borderline and extreme. But even without corporal punishment, all the rest, from bells, to control, to authority, to shaming students -- it can all be found, as they say, even in the best of schools. If you want nonfiction, you can read Illich's Deschooling Society. But if you'd rather have fiction, Border Liners will reach you via the senses rather than the mind. Here it's September -- school time again. Read Border Liners and ask yourself how your children's school is so different from the one in this story, and how much they, strangely, may have in common."
5,gripping,"This book was one of the most complex I've read in years, and had my full attention on multiple levels -- the characters and their tribulations are poignant, but there is an underlying theme of the interweaving of space and time that comes out in the last chapters. I'll be reading this one again -- a rare event."
3,well-intentioned rambling doesn't quite hit the mark,"I didn't really like Smilla either so I am not sure why I even read this book. The jacket hails it as ""gripping"" and ""disturbing"", but I found myself wondering from page to page why Hoeg was taking himself so very seriously with his hit and miss philosophical discussions of time. I went through periods of thinking that he was hitting on something very profound, but in the end felt myself wading in pretty shallow waters. Not a total waste of time, however - some interesting characters and a pretty addictive plot. I was just put off by his rambling discussions of a topic that he should have either put a LOT more thought into, or left out completely"
3,A bit disappointing,"Maybe the thrill of Smilla is still left in my brain, so I read borderliner with great expectation. You could say expectation is half met. I do not know if the story is about the author himself, because apperantly Peter Hoeg is the ""Peter"" in the book. I feel readlly upset when I cannot be sure of this. ('cos I have problem with accepting it is a personal account of some past event of one of my favourite writer)Anyway, I think the book is a little bit uncoherent. As someone pointed out before, some passage and chapter seems to be unnecessary and even, in my view, destroy the completeness of the story.Of course, I like the way he tells the story. Suspense, with room for thought. But the whole structure of the story is not very will built. I especially found the last part of his discussion of concept of time ""hollow"""
4,Psycosociological approach to childhood,"I've been reading this book with an unusual interest cause normally books concerning sociological and psycological issues like the integration of children with problems in our ""normal society"" , are not easy to read . This one pushes you to the end getting into the problem , making yourself asking who is really the ""normal"" and what is the meaning of time and education . 8/10"
5,Score compliments stunning visuals!,"I bought the soundtrack before seeing the film as I was sold on the trailer for the movie. Took me a few listens but, the music grew on me immensely and after seeing the film it compliments the images perfectly! Use of choir,synthesizer and ethnic instruments (much like McCreary's Battlestar Galactica and Zimmer's Black Hawk Down) offer a great listening experience."
2,"Some good, some not so good.","Meh, not for me. It didn't have songs you could get into and really let get into your bones. It's probably a good soundtrack for someone who likes hard driving heavy. It had too much that just didn't give me a melody line to follow or feel."
4,Pretty good motivaitonal cd,Watching the movie got me extremely pumped up to workout. I bought this cd to listen to while in the gym. I'd have to say about 5-6 sougs out of the 25 made it to my ipod for motivation. That's not as high of a ratio as I would have liked. Most the songs are too slow and repetitive sounding. But the one's that made my workout list are butt kickers.
2,300 special edition,"the pack is very nice but the music is a bit high, I have not seen the film yet, maybe after I see the film I may apriciate it more."
2,Bad walk-throughs,"This book has some really good explanations of the case interview format, pointers on conduct and overviews of frameworks. However, it had some really bad case examples. The sample solutions given did not seem to follow the clean logical and analytical approach that Wet Feet Press' ""15 Cases"" displayed for their sample responses. In fact, the answers given in this book are a good example of what to avoid: a lot of flair and big words and not a whole lot of case-solving."
5,Clear and Informative,This is a great book. It is clear and informative. I have been looking for insight into Chiron. This gave me insights and more.
5,Perfect condition!,The C.D. arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Would definitely recommend doing business with this seller!
1,Boring Communist Pop,"Oh how boring. Some whining brat in a cardigan preaching about the evils of capitalism. Sure, he's got a nice soft, effeminate voice and some catchy tunes, but are you prepared to hear these same tunes as the next Pol Pot kills us for wearing glasses? This is music for sheep."
2,Not written in Nepali script,"Unfortunately, this book uses all Roman Alphabet writing. If you need a dictionary with the Nepali script then try another. I think that says it all."
4,American Classics,"It was interesting ,But, I thought there would be more of the older trailers shown , and more info , as I Have A 1957 16' Fireball that I am restoring."
4,american classic,it was rare the trailer we seen good to be show to people and history too that dvd was good that why i got one today!!! we will get other kind someday thankyou
4,the Dhammapada,"This particular Dhammapada is very nice to read,it just flows very comfortabley. There is not alotof commentary after each sentence, just a shortintroduction and then the teachings of the Buddha.The HC is perfect for a pocket or a waist pack,backpack etc,. My advice is, get it, read it,keep it, and read it again, and then again.Dont give up..."
2,Did not work for me,"The product appeared to be effective the day after it was added to the pond. But three days later, the algae was back. It does not control algae in my pond and I will not buy this product again."
2,Did not work for me,"I tried this product to control green scum in the fountain in my back yard. I followed all instructions carefully, but after several applications it appears to have made no dent in the growth of the algae.My fountain is the back yard at my home in the Phoenix metro area, so daytime temperatures are very high and nighttime temps fall only into the 80s. It might work in less extreme conditions, but it certainly is not doing the job for me."
1,Waste of money,"I treated my 500 gallon pond as directed for 3 weeks. After no results and a kool-aid green pond, i poured in the whole bottle only to drain the entire pond a week later and start over. And yes, i run a oversized pump w/ a filter and waterfall."
2,Rusted within a month,"I purchased this set because I have a large family and this was good silverware for a good price...so I thought. I had 16 pieces of it rust within a month. A majority of the rusting was on the knives. This silverware came with a 25 year warranty. I contacted Oneida and was told I could send in for replacement pieces, a complete new upgraded pattern, or return the entire set for a refund. I opted for an upgraded pattern since I was afraid more pieces of the Vista set might rust. The only reason I'm rating this as a 2 instead of a 1 is because I was able to get a new set. However, I was without silverware for 2 weeks and it cost $13 to send it back in to Oneida. That part was non-refundable. Now I've got a whole new pattern of Oneida and I sure hope it doesn't rust. I wouldn't buy this one if I were you. The pattern is nice, but the hassle is not."
1,Just plain Bad,"I have seen some pretty cheesy movies with bad acting, but Counter Measures has to be in the top five worst films of all time.The story line, which has some great potential, is completely destroyed by the poor acting ability of the cast. Dudikoff can't even salute correctly - and he is supposed to be a SEAL??? Alexander Keith, while very attractive, does a very poor job convincing the viewer that she is a military solder. As for her role, I have heards better screams out 1950's era b-movies.The scenes inside the sub where just as bad. Was that a Russian sub or the Starship Enterprise. I've seen houses with less room than the sub had.The Special FX were attrocious, I've seen more realistic explosions using green plastic army men and firecrackers.All in all just a very bad film and a complete waste of time."
1,Nitty-Gritty Basketball Series 8: Dribbling,"The video is very bad. It is a waste of time to watch it. It is not worth of the money. It covers very basic techniques. You don't have to be a basketball player to know it. So, don't buy this video."
2,One little inconvenience makes a big difference.,"I thought this was a great product, speaker, FM etc. Only after I received it (after one defect returned), realized it could not 'remember' when I was after power off. Contacted Buslink they confirmed it. For this it becomes useless for me. It now only serves as USB."
5,FANTASTIC,"I received my order for this product in good time and as described. Just watched the DVDs and I have no complaints. They were complete (5 DVDs)The instructors described in detail, how a novice can turn to a professional, dancing Waltz, Foxtrot, Swing and Rumba.It was a Good Deal!!!"
3,Unstable,"I absolutely love this game. It is perhaps the most visually stunning game I've seen. The problem is the programers spent more time with pictures than a stable program. The program is OSX compatible, but about 50% of the time it crashes when loading a new map on BOTH of my machines. An older G3 and the new eMac each running OS 10.1.5. Also in OSX it has trouble with multiple monitor machines when you change the video settings. The OS9 verson is better, but i still had a few type 3 errors. Also the ""minimum"" requirments are just that. On my old machine I had everything on the lowest settings and I still wasn't getting better than 20 fps. In short I sadly recomend to buy the PC version."
3,Memory Hog!!! but pretty,This game is beautiful. Great art and a story to get lost in. You need to own a new mac though. Serious memory hog! VERY VERY VERY difficult to load and get running correctly and forget [tech support] for help for they give none. Once you get past all of the loading and memory issues it's fun but getting the game onto your system is a pain in the neck. (And I load up a lot games and programs I'm telling ya this [was not a fun install])
4,Great game but hard,"This game is great! The graphics are pretty good and it is full of action. A little difficult, however. Almost too hard. Has some of those puzzles that you would never figure out without clues, and the fighting is not easy. But overall great."
2,dissapointed !,I am totally dissapointed with this game. It is such a linear 1st person shooter that there is almost nothing you can `choose` to do. You just follow a path and kill certain creatures and watch the movie scenes at the end of chapters. I didnt like the storyline either. I was hoping it would be more parallel with the original Alice story but it is not even related !
1,Didn't work to well for me...,I thought I'd use this to smooth and blend colors with my Prismacolor colored pencils. Well that turned out terrible! The paper looked all damp after using this and the colors did not blend to well or look smooth but only worse. I also couldn't clean the tip of the markers after using it as it was shown in the instructions so I guess it will be ruined anyway. What a waste of money.
3,Prisma color blending marker,"The marker is great, but I was really dissapointed that the seller wrapped an inventory sticker around the entire marker and when I tried to take it off, it messed up the actual prismacolor label and left nasty sticker residue down the marker shaft."
3,Professional Grade but Not the Best,"I am a fashion illustration student, and I've used a lot of blender markers and blending techniques.As far as blenders go, Prismacolor is professional grade, but every professor I know recommends the Chartpak blender (and ONLY the Chartpak blender). This is because, on a whole, Chartpak markers are a lot ""wetter"" than Prismacolors (which are ""drier"" markers) and blending relies very much on mixing colors before they're too dry and anchored on your marker paper. Chartpak blenders also usually cost about $3 or $4, so it's not too much of a price increase over Prismacolors (usually $2 or $3 at local art stores in NYC).For an even more economical option, if you're a painter, you could try blending markers and colored pencils with Gamsol or another oil paint thinning medium + tortillions. You get a lot more control and it's cheaper, but it takes a bit of practice."
4,Excellent for blending!,If you need some added oomph in blending your Prismas (whether markers or colored pencils - it works for both!) get this. It's fairly cheap and gives you nice minimal-streak smooth blending. With colored pencil it literally breaks it down to be liquid and it blends like a wet medium should. With ink it provides a clean transition between colors. I HAVE to have this!
4,Wonderful!,"This book is easy to use and full of ""comfort food"" recipes. I was delighted to see things like old fashioned Easter egg dye recipes and charming ways of serving foods and snacks (especially the ideas for children's treats). It's definitely a book worth having in your collection."
5,Like Grandma Used to Make by Readers Digest,This is a cookbook I have personally owned for many years and use quite often. I bought and gave this new purchase to a grandniece as a wedding gift. I am sure she will enjoy its wonderful recipes also and enjoy cooking healthy meals for herself and her family. It arrived within the shipping time of the USPS in good condition.
1,Like Grandma Used To Make,The book I received looks nothing like the one in the picture. There is nothing I want to prepare in this cookbook so I believe the recipes are different too.
3,Italian dishes always wrong,"As usually the Italian recipes are wrong, totally invented, NO ONE in Italy puts garlic in their lasagne, the meat sauce doesn't have sausage in it, it is cooked for 2 hours and the ingredients are meat, carrots, celery, onion, fresh tomato sause."
3,"Buy this last, it's half a game by comparison","My brother in law happened to have this sitting around and let us have it. It's just like Guitar Hero 2 except it about half the game. It has less songs, and no extra songs you can buy. It has half the characters and the ones it does have are just new outfits on the guitar hero 2 characters. It has a bunch of good songs on it, but it's value should be about 1/2 of a full game since it took about as much work to make as an expansion pack. Think of it as an expansion pack for Guitar Hero 2."
2,Not good at all.,"This is the worst GH game i have played. I thought it would be good because it was the 80s and i like some 80s music so i got it. It had about what, not even twenty songs and i only heard of ten of them and i only liked about four. The graphics r the same as GH2s and the store is not worth being on there. The game only took me an hour and a half to beat on hard and then there was nothing to do with it. I paid fifty dollars for this? If i returned it i would only get five bucks and then they would sell it back again for fifty. This is not a good game unless u like to pay fifty dollars for not even twenty songs."
1,50 bucks!?,"This is nothing but an exapnsion pack, they just slapped some new songs into the GH2 engine and then expect us to pay the same price as a fully developed game that spent years to make instead of the 10 minutes they spent on this one."
3,Disappointing to say the least !!,"Now, I love Guitar Hero. I have 1 and 2 and was really looking forward to the 80's edition because thats the music I grew up with.That being said, I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers and let you know that they really dropped the ball on this one. I knew going into this that 80's would be based on GH2 and I was expecting only modest improvements and a new track list. I was not expecting LESS features than the original. This cannot even be called an expansion pack when they didnt expand a thing!There are: LESS Characters, Less guitars, Less venues, Less Songs, No outfits, and the rewards for completing levels are IDENTICAL to GH2.Its like they fired the developers and hired someone to repaint half the game, and threw out the rest of the game. Guitar Hero LiteI still like the game but am sorry I spent 50 bucks on it. If you are buying your first Guitar Hero game, get GH2 now and wait for the price of this one to go way down. Sorry"
2,Not the 80's I remember.,"There are definitely more definitive 80's tracks than what is on Guitar Hero 80's, trust me. The audio seems wierd and it's difficult to hear the singers. Venues are not new, just re-used. They had so much material to work with, yet, give us so little for 49.99. I don't see how they can sum up the 80's in 30 songs in the first place. It seems they are taking the fans for granted on this one."
3,More like Guitar Zero... wait that's no good,"Compared toGuitar Hero 2this game has less characters (no new ones either), 75% the number of songs GH2 had (not including songs you can buy, which for the record Encore has NONE), no new venues, no new guitars. They changed the clothing of their characters, slapped some neon colors around, and well, that's basically it. Sure there is new music, but as you can see from the full set list, the 30 songs aren't as many as GH1/2 and certainly aren't up to the high standard from GH.Let me sum up the game in one word: Cash-in.Why would Harmonix, a respected company, put out this desperate cash grab:1 They aren't makingGuitar Hero III: Legends of Rockand hope it will suck as much as Encore does.2 They are owned by EA now.Honestly if this was a 30-35 dollar game, then maybe 4 stars. But a smaller weaker set list with no original content? C'mon.Save your money forRock Band Special EditionorGuitar Hero III: Legends of Rock."
2,"Only 30 songs, gets old quickly","I was really looking forward to this game as I'm in the 80s generation. But, the 30 songs just aren't enough (especially when you compare it to GH1 or GH2 with nearly double that). I found that in the first day of owning this one, I had mastered (on Medium) all of the songs. It got old quickly. I can't say that for GH1 or 2."
5,This Game Rocks,"I really enjoyed jamming to the 80s. When you pick a fast song and are doing good, your hands catch on fire! This is really fun. I own all of the Guitar Hero PS2 games, and this is one of my favorites!"
3,Could have been so much better,"The kids (and me) were so excited about this game before it came out. When we got it, we were all disappointed. There are so many great 80s songs and I'm wondering why they chose the songs that they did for this game. There are at least 7 songs out of 30 that I've never even heard (and I was a teen in the 80s!). And the shop sucks! There are no extra songs to buy and very little extra stuff. It seems like this game was thrown together without much thought."
3,More like a Song Patch,"If you already have GH2, you've seen everything this game has to offer. There aren't as many songs, there are no new characters (actually fewer), and the same old Venues. By purchasing this game, you are spending $50 on 30 new songs. If I were you, I'd wait and try GH3 in October, and maybe catch this on sale or get a good used copy. Still a fun game, but for fifty bucks, you gotta offer something more."
3,Guitar Hero II part deux,"This game is pretty much Guitar Hero II with half the characters dressed in 80's clothing and different songs. There's two fewer venues to make up for having ten less songs.I wouldn't recommend this unless you are really tired of the first two installments and can't wait for Guitar Hero III in October.It's fun and a solid game, but I'm not sure it's really worth $50."
4,80's Rock!,"Enjoyed rocking to the 80's but there isn't as many songs as I hoped! Opened entire song list in just under 3 hours....would like more of a challenge! Still super cool to hear these ""old skool"" jams!"
1,Great Idea Bad Execution,"Let me start by saying that I love Guitar Hero I and II and while you can argue for years about the song list for Encore: Rocks the 80's for me the disappointment comes in the execution. In the first two versions of Guitar Hero the production quality on the songs made you feel like you were playing with the real band at a big venue. With the new version, it sounds like your playing in someone's basement through a bad amp with a lead singer who has a cold. The other problem with the new version is the guitar work itself. With the previous versions the notes on the screen matched the song, in this new version there are many times where there seemed to be no connection between the music and the notes you were playing. This felt like Red Octane was in a hurry to get something out, grabbed some songs that would be cheap to license and then hired a second rate group to help them record the covers on bad equipment. I'm seriously considering sending my copy back to Red Octane."
3,3rd place in a great series aint that bad....,"Most reviews already hit this on the head, its nice to have a new set of songs but there is not enough songs and the track list is average at best. Following up Freebird as the final song with some Extreme song most people have never heard was pretty lame. Best buy has this game for $39.99, which is still about $10 to high. But none the less its still worth adding to the collection. Its like return of the Jedi in the Star Wars Trilogy, still great but not quite up to par as the previous."
5,Used but great condition,I ordered this product used but its in great condition. No problems playing. Super fast shipping as well. Thanks
3,Could be better,"This was the first Guitar Hero game I owned. Guitar Hero 80's is just Guitar Hero II with neon colors put all over.Guitar Hero has very responsive gameplay but the same modes return and didn't add any bonus songs to the game which is dissapointing. The graphics in this are good but with an 80's skin put on-well except the lead guitar player. Speaking of players, when you first start the game, you only have five characters and one unlockable character. The soundtrack is okay, consisting of bands such as Extreme, X, The Romantics, Twisted Sister, White Lion, and Quiet Riot. I was suprised to not have Guns n Roses in the game, and seriously, is Metal Health the best Quiet Riot song? C'mon, Redoctane. If you're one of those people that has to play every song Redoctane throws out there, you should buy it, but the rest of us are better off skipping the 80's altogether."
2,from guitar hero to guitar zero????,"i a sorry fellow shredders,but i feel like red octane dropped the ball on this one. there are way to many flaws with this game to be priced at $45-55. that is how much guitar hero 2 goes for,if not more. this game has the same venues as 2 minus stonehenge,the same characters(with 80's styled wardrobe) 1 unlockable character, no unlockable songs. speaking of the songs...some songs either end terribly, have long lulls in the middle with no guitar, or the solos suck(metal health solo is no where to be found,replaced with boring chord progession). unless you are a die hard 80's rocker, rent,or borrow, do not buy this."
4,Great becaus of the price drop.,"I have Guitar Hero 3 and Aerosmith for the Wii, and Guitar Hero 1 and 2 for the PS2. I love playing all of them, mainly because I love the music, and also, my 3 year old likes to play along with a play guitar, so it is a good bonding experience (he always wins...). I was hesitant to buy this for $49.99, but I jumped as soon as I saw the price drop to $19.99. Even though it offers nothing new, it is a blast from the past to re-enjoy some songs that I listened to before high school. I can't believe some of the big retailers are still charging $49.99 for this. Rock Band 2 for the PS3 is on deck :)"
4,Love the 80's,All in all we like the game. I purchased GH3 for my wife and then got her this game as she was a teen in the 80's. She says that its a little bit short for game play but she likes the music. Also she has fun playing it.Its a good game for beginners
3,Boring songs,"Besides the complaing about the price and lack of...well everything, my biggest complaint is that the songs on here, may be fun to listen to on the radio, but are super boring/annoying to play. Besides ""Only a Lad"" ""Play with me"" and a very few others these are just really strange choices. I mean Flock of Seagulls? Come On! Shouldn't that be on Keyboard Hero or something... I had to turn off ""Because it's midnight"" I was so bored with it.I've played Guitar Hero, and own Guitar Hero 2, and if you don't own the latter, GET IT. Totally awesome. Tons of songs, super fun to play. Really great.Anyway, here's to hoping Guitar Hero 3 blows me away."
3,"Expect New Music, But Not Significant Changes","This game is worth buying if you're looking for a change of pace in song options, otherwise its exactly the same as Guitar Hero 2. There was definitely so much more that could have been done with this game- its apparent that its creation was rushed just to release it sooner. For example, the venues, characters, guitars, and other features that can be unlocked are identical to Guitar Hero 2. Overall, I recommend this game to any Guitar Hero fans interested in a different music selection, otherwise the new features (or lack thereof) may be disappointing."
2,GH Addict is disappointed,"This game only comes with 30 songs, not a lot of thought behind the notes on hard and expert, and paying the same price for this game vs. the others is just not worth it. I've played both GH1&2 and beaten both and still love those games, but some of the covers really didn't sound like I expected, and why oh why did they change the key of I Wanna Rock?! That's the song to sell this game and its not even right. I'm very disappointed in this release and going to watch more closely before I buy another GH game."
2,What a disappointment,"This game brings nothing new to the table. It is nothing more than a rehash of Guitar Hero 2 with only 30 songs. Guitar Hero 2 boasted over 60 for the same price. The game delivers on only one front - it features the same gameplay as Guitar Hero 2, complete with the excellent co-op mode and very helpful Practice Mode. The intro animation, the unlockable instruments, all of the backgrounds, and a fair amount of the art was lifted shamelessly from Guitar Hero 2.I would recommend this game only to people who love 80s music. Fans of the genre will be disappointed by how little this title offers for the price."
3,Not the best of them all!,"Ok! Here is the deal. Anne of Windy Poplers in actuallity was written as a Prequal... It was written in after Anne's House of dreams, but in the whole story it is 4th in the series! I think this book is good in it's own way... It has some very touching characters such as Little Fellow, Little Elizebeth, Rebecca Dew, and of course the entire Pringle family! The book takes place in a town called Summerside where Anne takes a position as a principal of the local high school. Anne is met with strong opostion from the Pringles; a family who litterally control the entire town! She also is forced to deal with a cold hearted vice-principal by the name of Catherine who makes everthing that much worse on Anne. This book makes very little mention of The characters from Avonlea such as Diana, Merilla, ect...... Which bothered me, and the book is not nearly as excellent as the others in the series, but all in all should be read by the true Anne of Green Gables fan!"
3,A book you could skip in the series,"Out of the entire 8 book series this is definately my least favorite book. After the 3rd book where you here so much about Gilbert you would think that the 4th book would talk more about him. Instead the entire book is made up of letters from her to him telling about her life with out mentioning really any romance between them and what is going on in his life. It has some cute stories in it and it shows Anne for the first time as an outcast that isn't liked, which is a very new thing for her, but i just could not get into this book. It is just a very uninteresting and unimportant book in the whole plot line of the series. It seems to just interupt the flow of the story line through the books. Anne of Windy Poplars is a book that could just be skipped if you are following the life of Anne."
3,Not as good as the others,"Fourth in the Anne of Green Gables series, and the most tedious. Montgomery seemed so intent on packing it full of interesting characters that she largely obscures the plot. This may have something to do with the fact that this book was written much later most of the books in this series; Anne of Green Gables (1) was published in 1908, followed by Anne of Avonlea (2) in 1909, Anne of the Island (3) in 1915, and Anne's House of Dreams (5) in 1917. This one (4) wasn't published until 1936. My guess is that Montgomery felt pressured by the pre-existing prequels and sequels. This is worth reading if you're reading the whole series, but it certainly isn't up to their standards."
3,"A Bit Slow, But Still Enjoyable","I didn't really like the form that the book was in, with only letters from Anne-- I would've liked to see some from Gilbert!-- and at times, it got a little boring. However, L.M. Montgomery created many delightful characters, and Anne is still her bright, cheerful self, even if she is a little grown up. An overall good read!"
3,Not quite the same Anne,"Anne has her same spunk and personality, but it does not come through often in this book, as most of it is narrated through Anne's letters to Gilbert. There are a few interesting new characters, and Anne's trials as a high school teacher are amusing and touching. This book doesn't fit well with it's 'sequel', ""Anne's House of Dreams'"" because it was actually squeezed into the series post ""Anne of the Island"" and ""House of Dreams"". The unaware reader will wonder why the ""Windy Poplars"" characters and events are never in or never referred to in the rest of the series. Still a good read, just not the best."
4,"Fun, but not the best","Anne of Windy Poplars is the fourth installment of the Anne of Green Gables series. It is mostly set in a city called Summerside. Anne has left Redmond College to begin a job as principal of Summerside High School. She ends up staying in a place called ""Windy Poplars"" with two widows and an old maid. Throughout the story Anne has to face winning the affections of the Pringle family, solving marital problems between her friends, and helping a little girl named Elizabeth find laughter in the world.As with the rest of the series, this book is a thrilling read, with sorrows and triumphs. I feel that this book is missing something that the others have (it is probably the absence of Gilbert, who rarely shows up in this book), but it is fun and exciting all the same.I would recommend this book to all fans of Anne of Green Gables, as well as to those who are simply looking for laughter and magic in their life."
3,"OK, but not Great.","This book is definately better than most other fiction books I've read, but its one of my least favorite in the Anne series. The Gilbert-Anne romance and Avonlea truly made the first books magical, that was slightly lacking here. I will read it again and again, but only after all the other books."
3,A interesting Anne novel!,"Anne of Windy Poplers is the fourth novel in the Anne of Green Gables series. I found it to be rather boring compared to the other novels. I don't like the fact that the book doesn't really focus on many familiar faces.. Although I found the characters of Little Fellow and Little Elizebeth to be quite interesting. So all in all it it is a pretty fair book, and if you are a lover of the Anne of Grenn Gables or the movie Anne of Avonlea you definatly need to read this book!"
5,fantastic,"You will love this book if you loved the rest of the Anne series, tthough I must admit it is not as good a book as the first 3. Read it and you will be brought back into the world you love with charechters you know as well as some new ones. In the place where things are always wholesome, PEI"
3,Not the best..but pretty good,"This book was my least favorite out of the four that I have read. It mostly contained letters from Anne to her future husband Gilbert Blythe. It also takes you through three years of her life living in Windy Poplars. Her one challenge she had was trying to deal with ""The royal family"" the Pringles. Although you might need to read this book to understand the next, I wouldnt recomend reading it."
2,Anne of Windy Poplars---not quite worth-reading,"Anne of Windy poplars is the most boring of the whole series.I don't like the way Montgomery wrote the book in the form of letters.What is more,the writer seldom mentionedthe happenings in Avonlea which i always want to know about.The characters in this book are all new except Gilbert.I soon found this book barely attractive and stopped reading after fininshing half of it."
1,disappointing!,The last two Azusa videos were great. This one looked like very little thought was put into planning. The singing was mediocre. And the gentleman who sounded like Mahalia just went on entirely too long. Please save your money and hope for better from Bishop Pearson's next project.
1,Shame on the producers of this video!,"This video was filmed (very badly) in a zoo, then copied over a mountain background to try and make you think these animals are really in the wild. All the time the announcer tries to fool you into thinking they're in the wild. However, the compilation is done so badly, that it's impossible not to notice. It's very sad that someone would produce garbage like this and try and sell it off as a real nature video.Amazon should remove all products by this company off of their site and not support companies that con their customers out of money."
4,Raw,"A very real and atmospheric perspective of small time gangsters in Brighton during the 1930's. Persevere, its does'nt reach out of the pages and grab you, its rather a slow burn and intriguing story. Thats why it's a classic Graham Greene."
4,Interesting. Just......Interesting,"This was an okay novel, but I suspect I am missing a lot, not being particularly attuned to symbolism or Catholic eschatology. So, I had to read it as just a crime story although the introduction to the book by J.M. Coetzee did shed some necessary light on the book's theme. I found the book interesting for its view of life in the English beach town of Brighton and for some of the characters. Also, it goes without saying, Greene is a master wordsmith. But I also found parts of the book somewhat contrived, particularly Ida's obsession with catching Pinkie to avenge the murder of a corrupt newspaperman she met briefly at the book's opening. But, maybe what I think is contrived is the ethereal stuff I mention at the beginning of this review. This is only the second work of Greene's I've read and I still have his more major books ahead of me. Some say this was not his best. I hope that's the case. It's a good story, but not a page turner."
5,"Excellent, gripping. A facinating study","I was a Graham Greene virgin and my first encounter was hard and awakening. I thought Greene combined psychology and philosophy with pure fiction. It is a book which can be read on many levels, and all will give enjoyment. I myself, am a philosophy and English Literature student and found the relevence to these topics amazing. Anyone else who does philosophy will want to question Hume's ideas and I suggest those who don't study the subject read up on philosophical ideas about human nature. All in all, a facinating book. I have not yet read any other Greene and would be delighted if someone could point me in the direction of another of his works, one possibly with parallels to Brighton Rock. Thanks"
5,"Evocative, moving, beautifully written","Greene describes Brighton so that I can see it, even though I've never been there. The characters are alive and real to me, even though they are types I have never met in real life. The plot kept me reading as if it were a contemporary thriller. It was creepy and totally engaging. My only problem here, as with all four Graham Greene books I've read, is the Catholic symbolism. I'm Jewish, so I feel really left out. The struggle between good and evil is interesting, but the pressure felt by the Catholic characters not to sin, is something I've never felt, although I am a moral and ethical person."
5,"Yes, They Call Him ""Pinkie,"" But He's Not Nice","This is a great read. Published in 1938, it captures the essence of a certain criminal type found in an urbanized, pressurized, crowded world full of people governed only by their own sordid selves and the fear of jail and the hangman. Pinkie is the central character, the seventeen-year-old leader of a small crew of Brighton toughs. Pinkie is ambitious; he challenges another much more powerful gang.Pinkie is a psychopath. He is basically ignorant, but he has plenty of animal cunning. Brief flashes of youthful compassion are quickly overwhelmed by memories of his brutally cold family and vague dreams of gangster grandeur. Pinkie does not hesitate to kill anyone who knows anything that might land him in jail.I had read a couple of the brilliant Graham Greene's novels before I recently spotted this book, which has been described as an example of his early, still largely undeveloped, work. Whatever. This book is a gem."
2,Very poor audio rendition,"I have listened to only a few tracks of this book-on-CD, and maybe I should wait for a while before posting a review, but here is what I can already say. First, while Scott Fitzgerald is clearly a great writer, he writes about characters who are so far from who I am and I care about that I wonder if I will ever really like his novels. I have read ""This side of paradise"" before listening to this one, and found it equally uninteresting. Almost everyone seems to be an obnoxious and spoiled character. There is way too much aristocracy, money and privilege, and I find all characters rather fake. BUT, what is worse about this CD is... Tim Robbins. He reads mostly with an annoyingly low, dreamy voice, playing all women with a terrible fake-feminine voice which really seems to come from a drag queen. I will never understand why so many men have to read women's voices as if words were spoken by a drag queen. Overall, this is a pretty bad audio book."
1,The most banal narration ever...,"Even George Bush can fake a better southern accent! Lest ye be fooled by the acclaimations that Robbins has been awarded for his acting/directing: A narrator he is not. Makes me wonder if he had ever read the book before embarking on this job. The main character/voice of the book is read so fast that details are lost, and every voice in the book has about as much personality as a chirping prairie dog. I couldn't even sit through the whole thing it was so tedious. To think that an audio book would be more tedious than actually reading a book. Stick to movies Mr. Robbins and hopefully you will never ruin another American classic! I recommend skipping this one."
2,Don't listen to this in a car.,We love to listen to audio books in our car which is reasonably new and fairly quiet on the road. I've read the other reviews and agree with the comments about Tim Robbins. The biggest problem we had was that his volume would trail off at the end of just about every sentence. I was constantly turning the volume up and down so we could hear the words but not get blasted out. Luckily I have a volume control on my steering wheel so I didn't have to reach over to the radio every minuet. The problem could have been fixed by a good sound guy but it seems that the gain was set only on one level. If you used ear phones our plaid it on your home stereo it would be OK.
5,like a sad but magical melody,"It's easy to see why The Great Gatsby has become such a classic. The plot is simple, yet Fitzgerald's writing is so lyrical that I felt like the story was layered with deeper meanings and symbolisms that maybe I wasn't quite getting. Perhaps I need to listen to it again.Robbins' narration is excellent; he gives each person their own distinct voice which fills out and complements Fitzgerald's characterization. And Fitzgerald's narrative style is so timeless that it's hard to believe this was actually written over 80 years ago. It is this timeless quality that makes a true classic.The book reminds me strongly of Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's -- a outsider looking back and telling the story of the brief and magical time that he crossed paths with dazzling but tragic people, the simplicity of the plot, the symbolisms and deeper meanings. Perhaps Capote was more than a little influenced by Fitzgerald's earlier work -- ??"
1,The Great Gatsby as performed by the cast of SNL,"It had been 40 years since I had read the Great Gatsby and I had an 8 hour drive, so I took this edition out of the library. If anything can make an 8 hour drive seem even more interminable, this is it. Tim Robbins' rendition is simply terrible. Each character other than the narrator, Nick Carraway, is a caricature as might be performed by a high school drama class or perhaps John Belushi, Dan Ackroyd Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner in a spoof of the novel. Find another audio version or read the book - if you listen to this version you will certainly be bored and irritated."
4,Prodigal Son : Family Business (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1729) (Special Edition),move quick and draws you in to the story so you want to read the next book to see what happens
3,Just short,"I was very eager to read this book after it came out and the generally good reviews convinced me to get it right away. I was disappointed, however, once I started reading it. While it is extremely well researched and detailed my problem with the book is that it soon becomes a chronological description of the events of Walt Disney's life. I had anticipated more of an analysis of him as a person as well as some real indication of how he was shaped by and helped shape his times. I didn't need to read this book to find out that Mickey was a cultural icon. In fact the best part of the book for me was the preface which did approach what I expected from the author throughout the book. I am not discounting the enormous triumph he made in acquiring and detailing Disney's life, but this book was a disappointment in what could have been a larger (not in size) and more complete illustration of our society."
2,Love Walt; Hated the book,"I loved learning about Walt Disney, his early life, and his many experiences in developing his studio and Disneyland - they were truly inspirational. But the author is excessively negative about Walt throughout. On page after page he uses negative adjectives about Walt, when neutral, or even no adjective would be more appropriate for the situation. It's as if he was taking an English class and the assignment was to take an existing essay, and revise it to be as negative as possible. The title does not portray the content of the book - Walk's triumphs and imagination are consistently belittled throughout. I had this as an audiobook and listened to it on long commutes to work when I didn't have anything else to listen to; if I had it in book form I would have given up early on. Also, it could definitely be much shorter, without losing any important information."
4,Uncle Walt-we hardly knew ye,"And this biography is a total wonder: so much about his life, torments, lessons...all here. A bit too much background on his family and some awfully detailed moments (do we need to know exactly how much/exactly where something was?) but these moments can be skimmed...this is truly the meatiest, most honest, critical (not in a negative way) and finest bio of one of the 20th century's greatest innovators that you will read."
3,I really wanted to love this book.,"This book is about one of my heroes. Sadly, reading it is was as enjoyable as reading a timeline illustrated with bank statements. In fact, it should have been printed on ledger paper. Boring, with no real insight into imagination or artistry. Countless words were used describing loans, mortgages, income, and returns; comparatively few were devoted to expose of Disney's imagination. I'd suggest that you read a few pages at your library before investing the cash."
4,Entertaining but the tone is a bit 'off',"I enjoyed reading and learning more about Walt Disney. Some other reviewers mention errors, but I'm afraid I don't know enough about the man to have recognized any myself. It was fun to learn more about Walt, his background, his struggles and achievements.One thing I didn't appreciate was the tone of the writer, often sounding a little condescending towards his subject. I don't expect the writer of a biography to be unduly deferential, or referential, towards the person they are writing about - I expect them to sound completely neutral - but the writer here often sounded as though he was looking at / describing Walt Disney from above. It's hard to put my finger on - it was just a little 'off'.There may be a better biography of Walt Disney out there - in any case, this one passed the time well and was entertaining. It's a heavy book and provides lots of hours reading - lots of bang for your buck... lots of book for your buck"
3,"Meticulously researched, but lacks soul","I enjoyed reading about Walt Disney's life, and appreciated Neil Gabler's attention to detail in writing this biography. It is meticulously researched! However, I felt that the author failed in really capturing Walt's spirit -- at times it seemed that he lacked admiration for Walt -- and all of the information from his unprecedented access to the Disney Archives could not make up for this, and left me feeling somewhat disappointed and still wanting. For those who feel similarly, I would recommend reading the biography written by Bob Thomas in addition to this version, for a more complete sense of Walt Disney."
2,Disappointingly Dull Disney,"How could the biography of one of the most imaginative and creative minds ever to work in Hollywood be as boring as this epic work? Gabler's portrayal of Walt Disney is so cluttered with minutiae - the backgrounds of various animators, for example, unnecessarily are discussed in excrutiating detail - that it takes more than five hundred pages to get the reader from Disney's birth to the development of Disneyland a mere fifty years later. From that point onward, Gabler races through history, giving short shrift - slightly more than one hundred pages - to Disney's later accomplishments. The author's discussion of the making of ""Snow White"" is longer than the film itself, while works like ""Mary Poppins"" rate barely a mention. A whopping one hundred eighty pages are devoted to notes and acknowledgements, confirming Gabler was diligent in gathering his facts. Too bad he wasn't more judicious - and entertaining - in getting them into print."
4,Penetrating Disney bio (not at all Mickey Mouse),"It's hard to imagine a time when Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse weren't household names, but that day, in fact, did exist, up until the 1920s. That's when animators led by Disney drew Mickey Mouse. In this hefty, thoroughly researched profile, historian Neal Gabler draws a deeply detailed picture of Disney and his business, from his work animating silent-movie shorts in a Kansas City garage through his years of international fame - and troubled finances. Gabler persuasively argues that although Disney classics, such as Snow White and Pinocchio, may be considered relics today, they were revolutionary works of art in their time. This biography's biggest drawback is its intimidating length, but it rewards readers who persevere. We recommend this history to anyone seeking to understand popular culture, and the competing demands of making art and making money."
5,Great book and what a suprise,"A friend lent me this book and I could not put it down.I am a baby boomer and this book gave me so much insight intothe background on how ""Uncle Walt"" was able to impact my life and most baby boomers from the mid forties to the early sixies.It is also a great book for MBA types on what to do and not do in running your own business.For those of us weaned on the early Disney catoons, original Mickey Mouse Club and the Wonderful world of Color, so much becomes clear on how, why, and what went on off camera. At the same time you find he was not a saint,not especially bright, and not really the talent most atribute to him.But you do come to understand the dream, the pursuit of the dream, and how his drive and vision made him one of the most influential people of the 20th century. Most important his contribution to the contributions made by the baby boomer generation.The book is long, but in the end well worth it."
3,"Good, but not that great",Picked this book up after our last trip to Disneyland. Overall it was a decent read but could have done with a lot of flowery words (ones you have to go to the dictionary to find) and the psychological treks the book takes. Sometimes I couldn't tell if I was reading a biography or a college dissertation. Middle of the road piece
4,"great read, but slow at times",at times it was slow but really interesting and overall a good read about an incredible and future thinking man. Great history about the early days of Disney animation
2,Disappointing ... Not what I expected from the reviews,"I have to take exception to the reader reviews of this book. I ordered the book based on these reviews, but now that I have it in my hand, I find that I'm very disappointed. While the book design and layout are fine, and many of the beads are interesting, I found the projects to be disappointing. For the beginning beader, this book may provide some inspiration, although I think the instructions are very sketchy, at best. I'm still searching for a good design book on beading. In the meantime, I do like ""All Wired Up"" by Mark Lareau -- the gallery of jewelry designs at the end of his book are great!!"
4,life of Nephi is a wounderfull book of a family who came to the Americas to live and prosper in this continet because they wee,is a wounderfull book of a family who came to the Americas to live and prosper in this continet because they were living in Jerusalem in the times when the persisan took over the city and burned it down so the family was warned by GOD to move to the Americas and live and prospered.
4,Well done,"Well written book by a Great Author. Nephi, a prophet of God has set an example for all of us living today."
3,missing a track,"Whether or not the claims that this soundtrack is a rip-off, it is still a great listen. My problem (and it's a big one) is that it is simply missing a track. The song/piece heard when Leonidas goes 1-on-1 with the Uber-Immortal giant is not included at all.That distinct drum beat cannot be found anywhere in the soundtrack. Contrary to common sense, it is not in ""Immortals Battle"" or even ""Fever Dream""... and that track is the reason I bought this ST!"
4,Amazing Soundtrack,"I assume you've seen the movie & lived the event with the amazing soundtrack.Yes, for me, while I was watching the movie at the cinema I was thinking of going back home & purchasing it online, & I did!So,if you are one of the soundtracks fans, it's a good choice.. get your copy.BTW, the music is kind of mysterious & you should have a good sound system to enjoy. XBASS needed :PHave fun."
4,PREPARE FOR GLORY,"This is my favorite movie of 2007 and one of my top favorites of all time. If a movie is great, it almost always has a great score which is what helped it to make it great. This is just the case here. I am able to just hear the music and relive the movie. If you enjoyed this movie and you enjoy listening to epic musical scores, then this soundtrack is definitely for you."
1,Poor in quality and originality,"Do yourself a favor and don't buy this album. It's a real rip off. If you are interested in this type of music check out Azam Ali, Laurena McKinnet & Dead can Dance."
3,"""Copied"" Theme","You may find this very interesting.One theme from 300, heard principally on the track""Returns a King"", is for the most part identicalto the main theme from Titus.If you don't know it, it's Shakespeare and stars Anthony Hopkins.When I heard it in 300, I knew I had heard it beforebut couldn't quite place it. Eventually, I remembered.As proof, if you look up Titus (right here on Amazon)and listen to the first sample, titled ""Victorious Titus""and listen to ""Returns a King"" from 300, you'll see what I mean.Just found it to be very interesting, that's all ..."
1,A disgrace,This album is an absolute disgrace. The music is stolen from other composers' works. They are not receiving any money for the use of their intellectual property. Tyler Bates should be ashamed and I hope someone steals something valuable of his so he knows what it feels like.
2,Rather tedious,"This music is excellent within the film. As a stand-alone work, it's boring. It sounds like video game background music. Some music works solely as incidental to the scenes in the film and this is the case with 300.Excellent film - uninspired soundtrack."
1,Thievery,"I thought I had written a review for this product when it released, but I was apparently so angry I simply imagined doing so.All you really need to know is that much of the music used in 300 was plagiarized, most notably from Elliot Goldenthal's work for Titus. I am not speaking of a fleeting reference or inspiration here, folks, but of verbatim copying. Orchestration, rhythm, dynamics, tempo...all identical. I am, of course, specifically referring to Bates copying the piece from Titus entitled ""Victorious Titus"" to compile ""Returns a King.""How Tyler Bates managed to get away with such blatant theft and continue to score subsequent films is truly baffling. Many criticize other composers of copying constantly (Hans Zimmer's Gladiator from Gustav Holst's Mars, John Williams' Jaws from Antonin Dvorak's From the New World, etc.), but Tyler Bates has set a new standard for thievery in the modern age of film scores."
1,This score is disgraceful.,"I know it's been written here before, but this soundtrack is a total ripoff of other scores. I mentioned this in a comment above, but if you need one solid piece of proof, listen to Returns a King from this score and then listen to Victorius Titus from Goldenthal's score for Titus. It's pretty much note for note, instrument for instrument... well, you get the point. I am actually quite fond of composers mimicking other composers such as Powell's score for X3 borrowing some of Elfman's trademark techniques, but the score for 300 is outright theft. But, if you enjoy the music and you're not all snobby about who originally composed what, then buying this CD might be a good life choice."
2,it's ok....,"I purchased this cd and there's some powerful tracks on it (Returns a King, Fever Dream) the rest are good, but not as powerful as those two..."
5,300 Soundtrack Rocks!,Love the movie? Then you'll LOVE this cd. The music brings memories of the film to life- perfect for that boring commute to work! Highly recommended!
5,Works great,"Works great on wife's computer, much better reception than smaller adapters. Easy to set up and nice long cord for easy placement."
5,Works pretty darn well....,"Put this on a Dell 4100 Dimension that's running Win98Me. Only reason I purchased it was for compatability reasons. VERY, VERY pleased with this. Approximately 40 feet away from antenna, through one floor and two walls. Great strength and speed. Going to purchase another one because the newer Linksys antenna gives my new pc fits. L8r G8rs!!"
5,GR = GReat USB Wireless-G Adaptor,"My laptop is an ancient P3 which lacks built-in wireless, so I went with theLinksys WUSB54GR Wireless-G USB Network Adapter with RangeBooster. Typical with Linksys products, I followed the instructions to the letter [Run the Install-CD FIRST and follow the on-screen install instructions!], and I had it set up in 5 minutes and have been using it for almost a year now without a single problem. The range is good enough to reach my Linksys WRT54GL router from anywhere in the house (or outside) with a strong signal. I'm very happy with it, and if you're also looking for a USB wireless adapter, I recommend this one highly..Steven L. Hildebrand."
4,About the same coverage area,In using the WUSB54GR Wireless-G USB Network Adapter with RangeBooster I had about the same coverage area as before with a small increase. There was not enough to solve my distance requirements.
3,No boost in range,"I did not see ANY difference between this and the non-rangeboost version.I'm very disappointed lately by linksys' wireless adapters since I had the portable version of this too which just snapped in half while I was removing it from my laptop. Tech support asked ""why would you remove your portable adapter after each use?"". ""uhh, because it's a PORTABLE adapter""."
1,"Horrible, untested product","The install CD states that it can't find a file even though it is right on the CD. Once you ignore that error and proceed the installation locks up. I contacted tech support at Linksys and Ronny (18856) hung up on me without helping me. All I got was this message ""Ronny (18856) Has Disconnected"". So much for tech support!"
1,Buyer Beware!!,"The RangeBooster feature will ONLY work if you are also using a Linksys Router that has RangeBooster. If you are using any other Router forget it. Nowhere in the description does it mention this. You don't find out until you buy it. It says this right on the box but nowhere on the web page. I got the WUSB54GR to replace my WUSB54B but it works much worse so I had to switch back and use the old one. So, in my experience, unless you've also got a Router with the RangeBooster feature, this thing will work worse than a normal Adapter. I tried to get Amazon to include this caveat in the discription but they wouldn't (""formatting incorrect"", whatever that means), so buyer beware!"
2,works great with xp (5 stars); Does not work with Vista (0 stars),"Works perfectly on XP desktop, no problems with installation or anything. Tried to use on Vista and had tons of problems. Tried to install 6 different ways, uninstalling each time. It would recognize the device and ask for a driver. Pointed it to install disk; ""no driver found"". Pointed it to ""Windows Vista compatible driver"" that I downloaded from Lynksys website, (after unzipping it), ""no driver found"". Called tech support and they tried to tell me it was the router compatability, and couldn't get them to understand that Vista would not even show the adapter as being there, even though upon plugging it in it requested a driver for ""USB wireless-G Network Adapter"". Highly recommend for XP, go somewhere else for Vista."
2,"Great Monster Quality, BUT NOT NEEDED!","Basically a HDMI cable transfers a digital signal from a source(HD DVD) to an output(TV). Unlike the old RCA cables, HDMI cables do not suffer from signal loss. Yes these cables look beautiful, and you will have bragging rights but they are NOT worth the price at all. Unless you are running the absolute top of the line equipment, will the purchase of this cable be justified.Save your money, buy a generic HDMI cable. It all works the same."
4,An Easy To Use Addition To The Monster Cable Family,"I purchased this cable to connect a television with an HDMI input to a Series 3 TiVo. The cable is flexible and plugs in easily. This cable also unplugs easily, but doesn't accidently disconnect when tugged on. I purchased this item directly from Amazon, and it arrived in the usual Monster bubble plastic. The bubble plastic is difficult to open at best. As far as I could tell, the video quality was compareable to the HDMI cable provided by TiVo. Overall, if you are reading this to determine if you should spend the money on this Monster cable instead of using the cable provided by your cable service or TiVo, then I would say stick with your existing cable until it fails you. If the price is no obstacle and you want an easy to use cable, then this may be the one for you."
4,very good cable but expensive,this cable produce top notch color but the price is a killar so if you're on a budget try something that is less expesnsive cable but other than that it'sa very good cable
1,Way too expensive - works fine though,I dont believe I paid retail ($119.99) for this at my local BestBuy. I was too desperate back then to try my new HDTV and didn't want to wait for an HDMI cable purchased online. So I just bought this based on the BB sales rep's recommendation. Although there is absolutely nothing wrong with this cable and it has been working perfectly... I just feel that I could have purchased an equally competent product for much much less. Its exorbitant price tag is the only thing that keeps me from recommending this product to anyone.
5,Great item GREAT price!,"If your going to spend the big bucks on the big TV's, recievers, etc... You HAVE to get the good cables. Not only is it far superior in preformance. It couldn't be easier to hook up! A LOT better then the audio/video cables. The price at Amazon is outstanding as well! Best Buy, Circuit City and the like are almost double the price! Plus no tax and free shipping.. GREAT!!!"
1,Dumb dumb dumb,What do they say about fools and money?HDMI uses TMDS which is a digital transmission system with built-in error correction. TMDS has been designed to work over cheap cabling and a $10 HDMI cable will meet the specification. If you spend 9 times more on this cable than another one then you have just wasted $80. That's all there is to it.You don't need expensive shielding or gold plated connectors for a cable. The picture or the sound are not richer or more vibrant with a $90 cable over a $10. In fact the signal is identical. Let me repeat - HDMI (& DVI-D) devices talk digitally with error correction. This cable and ones like it are for suckers only.
1,"Digital signals don't ""vary""","Expensive cables for a digital signal are the worst sort of scam, and people who spend extra money for them are ignorant of the technology. For analog signals, cable-quality can vary your reception-quality (though not as much as people think). But digital signals transmit data in ""1s"" and ""0s."" The ""1s"" and ""0s"" either get through, or they don't. If they do get through, you have a picture (or sound). If they don't get through, you DO NOT. With digital (unlike analog), you never have to WONDER whether you could, maybe, if only you'd spent a little bit more money, be getting a better result. If you see a picture, you know the ""1s"" and ""0s"" got through. If you see NO PICTURE, then your connection is loose, or your dog chewed through the line, or you have a bad cable. There is no in-between. The beauty of HDMI, the beauty if digital, is that you no longer have to wonder. How long will companies like Monster be able to keep this secret :)"
1,Your money is better spent elsewhere,"Like most have pointed out, it's a digital signal and there's no need for all the gas-injected, gold plated, shielded stuff monster cables hype. For analog signals this stuff absolutely makes a difference because analog cables are highly affected by outside EM interference.Some people have pointed out that monster cables are more durable. So yes, if you plan on swinging around on your cables it might matter. If, like most people, you plug the stuff in behind your equipment then leave it be for months and months, don't waste your money."
2,RIP off,"So you are at your favorite brick and mortar store, possibly a little nervous as you venture into the bewildering world of HDTV and drown in a sea of acronyms. You just paid thousands of dollars for the latest HDTV. The salesman asks you if you have the right cables to hook everything up and you aren't sure. He grabs a $100 Monster HDMI cable off the rack and... Stop right there!Monster cables are the biggest ripoffs in the home entertainment industry.Especially their HDMI cables. HDMI is a digital signal. You either have it or you don't. A cheap $15 generic cable will work just as well. Don't be pressured into buying Monster branded anything! They prey on your ignorance to inflate their profit margins. Don't fall for it!It's not just my opinion. Type this into Google:Monster HDMI cables ripoff"
1,Don't be fooled,"Let me break it down for you and make it simple. HDMI is a signal that's been built so well that it has little to no issues with signal quality. The only instance where that MAY become an issue is with the length of the cable, but in terms of wiring a convention centre. For this reason HDMI is just as good over ten dollar cables as it is over hundred dollar cables, when used in your home.The bottom Line with HDMI is as long as the signal gets to its destination, it WILL ALWAYS be the same no matter what carries it there.Simple HDMI works or it doesn't, 100% or zero, very black and white functionality."
2,"A good cable, but not a good value","What matters is using the cable with the highest capability your gear will support (HDMI, DVI, component), and using a decent quality shielded cable. But don't waste your money on ""features"" that won't affect the performance of the cable."
1,Complete Waste!,"They make 8-footer HDMI cable for $7 elsewhere by the tons! Don't waste your money and fall for Monster's trick, paying $75!"
1,Waste of money,As said before...All HDMI cables are the same. They work on a digital signal. You get 1080p with the same picture quality as you would with any HDMI cable. Don't waste your money on this garbage.As far as Monsters lifetime warranty goes...I have had my 12' generic brand HDMI cable for 3 years running my Xbox 360 and I have never had a problem.My cable cost $12If I ever did have a problem [which I wont] I'll pay $12 for another one and still wont pay anything close to as much as Monster brand.
1,HDMI is a DIGITAL connection,"It's either going to work or not work, there is no in between area where a better cable will give you better picture quality. It doesn't matter what the source or destination are, a 1 is a 1 and a 0 is a 0.Don't let the marketing make a fool out of you, get the cheapest HDMI cable you can find, the end result will be identical."
1,Its Like Putting Premium Gas into a New Car,"Okay people...here it is.....HDMI signals are made to work over the cheapest of HDMI cables...purchasing the ultra-turbo-powered-air tight-bestest cable in the world would have no visually perceptable difference to using a cheaper cable.Its akin to buying a new car, whose engine is made to burn regular 87 octane gasoline...The car will not run better on premium gasoline, though you are welocme to spend the extra money and put it in the car. The car gas mileage will be the same.Thank you and take care."
2,I wasted money on these - learn from my mistake,"These are really silly. The signal is digital. Any cable meeting the HDMI spec will do the same thing. This is not an analog signal that needs to be handled carefully. I spent a bunch of money on my home theater system and bought into the hype about Monster cables. I bought two four meter HDMI cables and a six meter HDMI cable - all 400 series. I should have saved my money and just purchased the cheap versions. Sometimes ""Just a Guy"" is an idiot. Learn from my mistake."
5,Sound enhanced,This HDMI cable by MONSTER is a must have for HD programs. It really enhances the sound and also makes the picture crisper.
1,Eqyss Micro Tek Medicated Shampoo and spray,"I may just be dealing with an unusually difficult case of scratches, but I used this product daily with the recommended spray and my horses condition worsened dramaticaly. case confirmed by Vet as Scratches.see photos on Flicker.Bluemaxfarm.comGood Luck."
2,IF it was not Crichton who wrote it ...,"This book is a total flaw. The only reason someone who isn't a doctor would buy it is because it was written by Michael Crichton. I suspect even doctors will find it boring. The title words "" The HOSPITAL EXPLAINED "" must be a joke by the editors. What is briefly explained is a little bit of medicine history. The language is dry, well, see for yourself ..."
2,Weird,"It's plain clear that this book was published again, after twenty years, due to Crichton's amazing fame as writer and screenwriter. There is nothing much, the language is totally dry, the patient's cases are often buried into a ton of medical terminology ( of course .. ) Anyway, I thought, at the end, that the book is totally outdated."
4,I found this book gripping even after just the first chapter,"I am only one chapter in to this magnificent (spelling, sorry) book and i love it. i have read almost every fitcion book Crichton has writtin know i can't wait to read the other non-fitcion."
1,AN ENORMOUS WASTE OF TIME,"This book is nothing more than dry reading all the way. I got nothing against hospital histories ( I bought the book, after all !! ) but this so called "" serious "" analysys of American medical situation is a joke. It seems more like a diary chenged into a book to make some money. It doens't reveal any new grounds on medicine, it doesn't give any lesson in medicine's history, nothing !"
1,Not impressed.,"I've read almost all of Crichton's books, but this one is my least favorite. I don't even remember if I finished it or not (that's how boring it was)."
2,geared more for medical professionals,"I expected this to be more of a ""medical thriller,"" something like ER in a book. But it wasn't anything like that. It's an analysis of hospitals written over 30 years ago. Some parts of the book are informative, but even though Crichton doesn't use a lot of fancy medical jargon, I think people in the medical profession would get far more out of this book than the average lay person. I've read many of Crichton's other books, but this one isn't anything like his others, so don't expect a thrilling page-turner if you read this book."
5,"Unique, powerful story of Mississippi","When I moved to the Mississippi Delta, where I lived for two years, I had no understanding of the rich history that confronted me from the start. The Delta is a magical place and because of Clyde Woods, I have perspective on the beauty and horror of this region. I lived near the small town of Drew (actually I lived on the grounds of Parchman) where evidence of early bluesmen and the modern civil rights movement still abound. The infamous Dockery Plantation (once home to some of the greatest blues musicians) is nearby and people who were part of the Movement are still alive and willing to talk about their experiences. Woods obviously spent much time in the Delta to craft his timely book. It is truly the best book I've read about Mississipi Delta history and it certainly gave me a much stronger understanding of where I had come to live."
2,Item Not as Pictured,"Photo is of a rim with spoke eyelets, but the rim that I received does not have spoke eyelets. That's an important difference to me and I would not have bought the rim if the photo was accurate. The description did not say either way so I went by the photo. I need to get the wheel built so no time to bother sending it back."
1,Better than what?,"Sorry but I have to give this product a low rating for pretending to be something it isn't. Sorry, but this stuff smells nothing like lavender. It smells like a chemical cocktail. The ""parfum"" at the end must be the part that makes it smell like chemicals, but don't expect anything resembling the smell of Lavender. This is closer to the smell of Tide with bleach. I'll use Jason toothpaste but their soap isn't ""clean""."
4,great hand soap,"This is great hand soap, but I found it too harsh for a facial soap. Overall, great product."
5,Better than I expected,"I have an interest in Orkney history due to the fact that a quarter of my own ancestry comes from there, so I picked up this book thinking I might learn a few things about Orkney during the Norse years. I honestly didn't expect much, having never heard of the author and seeing that it was his first work of fiction in years. I expected to have to wade through tedious prose and poor character development around a so-so plot. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. It was well-written, the main characters holding my interest and attention, and I found myself having a hard time putting the book down. I find myself wanting more. I'd like to encourage the author to write more Orkney historical fiction, perhaps something in the James Michener style following a family from ancient times to the present. I'd love to read a novel exploring Orkney history throughout more than just one distant century."
3,generation 2 revoltech evangelion,this evangelion is nice but one of his feet are slightly bent more then the other ive noticed this on my generation 3 evangelion which by the way his wrists are articulate unlike this one where they only spin also her legs are bowed weird probably so she can stand so aggressively low but standing up right kinda looks weird also the rounded blade she has seemed light and cheap only cause it didn't really fit into her hands
4,relaxing reading,"This is not great literature, but I enjoyed the book because it had a plot that held my interest and very likable characters. Sometimes, one just needs a book with which to relax. Healthy escapism hurts no one!"
1,not as expected,"From the picture displayed the four seasons 35121 blower motor lookes like the original blower motor. The 35121 blower motor is nothing like the original. After I installed the motor I have a humming noise that will not go away, and I cannot reinstall the heat shield that is critical for protection of the motor. I will keep this mistake (blower motor) but I will not order from AMAZON and I will not use four seasons again.Bill T. Sanders"
2,POP = Poor Old Photography!,"This book has the worst photography I have ever seen in my life. It uses outdated, low-res photography. It is a decent visual reference, but half the POP's are not even that good. Save your money."
5,Beth I hear you calling....,"Beth is great, was great and will be great in future. I like Peter Criss and I like KISS very much (got 24 records), so buy it!"
1,I wouln't recommend to Beth lovers,"I was really disappointed with Mr. Criss's solo of Beth. His attempt to reproduce the emotion, that was so deep and meaningful in the original, failed. I was looking for the original sound and instead got a cheap imitation. As far as the other two songs on the soundtrack, I can't say because I am only a fan of Beth and not Kiss as a whole."
2,doubtful edition,"I must confess to owning two copies of Wallis Budge's translation, and therefore my review may be colored or spoiled by previous contact. It must be noted that Dr Brooks used a Spanish translation from the Ethiopian Ge'ez as his starting point, and there are several lacunae and editorial lapses in this edition. It was also noticeable that Dr Brooks apparently believes the claims in the original and advances scarcely-disguised notions of Africanist superiority, which would be rightly termed racialism as it had been with Budge's British Imperial conceits. The assertions in the editorial review above are noticeably absolute and categorical, despite the legend which it relates, and which may be found in differing versions within Ethiopia itself."
3,WISDOM IS SWEETER THAN HONEY,"I HAVE READ THIS BOOK, AND THERE IS NOTHING I WOULD SAY TO DISCREDIT IT, AS IT WILL ULTIMATELY BE HELPFUL TO SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO SETTLE FOR SECOND BEST. I CAN SAY THIS AS A PERSON WHO HAS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ THE ORIGINAL VERSION IN ENGLISH TWICE, ONE OF THE TWO WHICH THE BOY lord napier STOLE FROM ETHIOPIA.THIS MODERN VERSION IS THE SKELETOL REMAINS OF THE ORIGINAL, AND IS PORTRAYED IN A MORE ACADEMIC FORM WITH ALL THE ALLEGE MYTHS AND LEGENDS REMOVED, NO DOUBT THIS IS WAY THE AUTHOR WANTED TO WRITE IT. I AM OF THE OPINION THAT THE ORIGINAL WITH ALL IT'S MYTHS AND LEGENDS IS SWEETER THAN HONEY, ALSO TO ME IT IS THE SWEETEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ AND MY LIFE HAS BEEN ENRICHED HAVING READ IT ."
2,"Content +, Sound -","The lyrics are not very good. While trying to be clever, the delivery is poor. The content is ""deeper"" but somehow trivial; songs about giving change to a bum aren't very exciting (""d.c. will do that to you""). It's fine to have an introspective album, but at least make it sounds catchy. Musically, this album is very different, for worse. I found myself skipping songs. Listen to some of the samples and judge for yourself. I enjoyed the first album a lot lot lot better."
3,Buscemi is the man,"I've always been a big Steve Buscemi fan, and he can hold a movie together just about as well as anyone, and this is no different.Buscemi does a great job portraying on the role of a paparazzi photographer who is waiting for his opportunity to get the 'shot heard 'round the world'. In his journey, he finds himself a friend in a homeless Toby, who dreams of becoming an actor. The interplay between the two characters drives this movie.The acting is pretty well done, but Buscemi, with his usual strong performance makes the movie good.I recommend a rental."
5,Corrections,"This is not really a review. Just wanted to point out a few things. If you read in the film description above it says ""Toby gets an acting job on a reality TB show.""They haven't started making these shows about tuberculosis yet. They're still just making reality TV shows.Plus, they don't mention there are a lot of extras included on this dvd. Here they are:--Director's commentary.--18 minute behind-the-scenes featurette with DiCillo and Buscemi.--full-length version of the music video for the song Alison Lohman performs in the film.--3 video podcasts made to promote the film on the web. They star Buscemi, DiCillo and Gershon."
4,Not to bad,This DVD was not that bad. The story line was very interesting but it kinda dragged on a little. The movie in general was pretty good though.
3,almost amazing until you hit track 2,"The most powerful song i think ever written about love and security is the first song on this album ""Demons Away"" By Matt Skiba of the Alkaline Trio, the rest of the album is hard to fallow and really doesn't do that great of a job but it is an awsome cd check it out if you like the plea for peace comps take action or any of the sort of benefit comps (fo some reason bands put their best songs on thee hard to find cds)"
4,Got tired of carrying around two eyeglass cases.,"The only downside is the case is a little big, but it will hold two very large eyeglasses. It is too bad someone doesn't invent a case that is large when you put the glasses in and then shrinks to fit them, so one does not have to carry around this large object on their belt. The leather is very soft and of high quality and so far the zippers seem to be holding up. There is a cleaning cloth sewn into each pouch, but it gets caught in the zipper if one is not careful. I cut them out, and could have put them in loosely, but I have my own cloth in my back pocket, and a better one at home."
1,Not a good place to start,"Presents non-standard techniques without pointing out the standard ones. The non-standard techniques were recommended strongly based only on author's personal opinions, without comparison to other standard techniques on broad spectrum.For starters, it is much better to look into ""An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms"" by Melanie Michell."
2,only mildly practical,"From the word ""practical"" in the title, I expected more concrete examples of software source code. There are no such examples in this book. In particular, Appendix A starts with, ""We don't provide computer code in this book"". (Thanks for waiting until Appendix A to tell me!)Otherwise, the book is well written and an easy read. It's just more theoretical and abstract than I expected."
2,Eraser Clay?!? Really Sculpey I think that is a stretch....,"My 2 girls love Sculpey clay, so when I saw they offered clay to make erasers I knew they would love that too. They had lots of fun making all kinds of erasers, but that's where the fun ends. The clay does NOT erase. It just leaves a colored smear on the paper. If you are looking for something fun and creative for your kids buy some regular Sculpey clay, but don't waste your money on this. Its not worth it."
3,Fun concept. Didn't seem to work well as an eraser,"Maybe I over baked the clay, though I was careful not to, but it doesn't erase well. Leaves a dark mark.It is fun to sculpt and comes with two tools for creating fine details. The colors are very vibrant and pretty.I'll experiment more with baking times and if I notice a substantial difference in the erasability, I'll update my review."
3,Good Story...,"...but I can't say I loved it. I didn't feel like they knew each other enough for their lust to turn into love. It really bothered me when they finally did ""make love"" too. I don't think they could have picked a worse time or a worse place! Other than that it was a good story though. I enjoyed reading about Maggie and Drew."
5,ANOTHER GREAT READ FROM GAYLE WILSON,"Gayle Wilson's books are habit forming. Her stories are facinating, her writing skill unique. There are storytellers and there are writers. For the fortunate reader this talented, multi-award winning author is that rare and wonderful combination of both.RENEGADE HEART is, indeed, Gayle Wilson at her best. Now comes the long wait for her next Intrigue.BJ"
2,"as much as I like the sharpness, it's hard to hold","I purchased this knife for my spouse who is elderly and cannot cut meat. This rocker knife is really sharp and cuts like butter through chicken, steak, pork and more. Unfortunately, the handle is very slim so it's difficult for even me to hold and I don't have any dexterity problems. I used coban (medical tape) to ""Fatten"" the handle which helps but now I have to hand wash it so the coban doesn't get wet. I may try to get a piece of foam but I wish I had purchased the Oxo brand which had a fat handle. If you need sharpness, this is great but if you need something with substance to hold onto, keep looking!"
5,buy this!!,A must have for persons with use of only one hand.was impressed it's ability to cut different meats and other foods.WI'll purchase a second one for traveling. wish had this years ago.
5,Great book for any Viper enthusiast,I read this book in one evening and then read it again with my kids. Great reference and historical details. If you do not own the car it makes you want to go and get one.
3,"good, but disappointing","I am more of a fan of Phillips ""nostalgia"" pictures than just the airplane pictures, so I was a little disappointed in the treatment of them. Several were cover pages with printing on them which ruined the nostalgia mood. Several were too small. Several were good. If you are a fan of all of Phillips paintings, then you must have this. The quality is excellent."
5,Brilliant!,"I think this album is great! There seems to be a song for every occasion! Alot of people dont like the music because they find it difficult to give it a lable, but isnt that a good thing?"
1,Item was not received,"I cannot review this book, because it was not received. It may not be the vendor's fault. The item was ordered after we moved to a new address, but it should have been forwarded by the post office. I have never been stiffred by an Amazon vendor. I prefer to think it is the post office that is at fault."
5,Cate your a star!,"What a great movie. The actors in this movie do a great job of showing us a little bit of Bob Dylan. No movie could ever define the man though, he is what he is. Cate Blanchett plays my favorite side of Dylan in the movie and does it well. Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Richard Gere all in one, not to mention the movies about Bob Dylan what more can you ask for."
4,Good covers,"This is a fine collection of covers of great Dylan songs spaning his entire career - so far. Excellent complement to the film ""I'm Not There."""
1,It's Half there,"I recieved the item quickly, but it was only half there. I got the second half of the two disc collector's edition. The DVD was in a single disc case so it wasn't like the whole thing was meant to come in the first place. Good thing is the seller refunded me very quickly and painlessly when I made contact; shippping and all. Disappointed I don't have the film though."
2,Bob Dylan cult movie,This is Bob Dylan character played by a woman. She did a pretty good job and this film has a cult following. If you like Dylan...then you might want to watch this movie...
5,I'm Not There,"I am thirteen. I just didnt want to use my parents account.I just saw this movie two nights ago. It is the best movie in the world and about the best musician in the world. This isnt like any biography movie. He is portrade by six differnt actors. If you don't know much about Dylan you wouldnt understand alot of refrences. All the Dylans in this movie represent him. Like Christian Bales character represent when he was a young folk artist and later in the movie when he became a born-again christian. His name is not in the movie either. Like one time a women says something and Jude Quinn answers ""Just Like a Women"" like the song. Its to hard to explain in a review. You just have to see it for your self. I also thought the women who plays Alice Fabian( who represents Joan Baez) lookes alot like her."
4,"Quirky, fun, often-beautiful","The title about covers it, I guess...;-) The concept of having many different actors (one female) playing the part of Bob Dylan does work for me, as do the occasional Fellini-like bits of surrealism. I just plain enjoyed watching (most of) this movie."
3,So-so,"This movie seems like a love letter to Dylan. I give it three stars simply for the creativity and beautiful cinematography. I just feel like I don't get this movie simply for reasons having to do with me not the film itself. I appreciated the Intro to the Film readings, without these, I feel like I'd truly be lost."
5,I'm Not There is Where It's At,"While most bio-pics glorify or vilify the subject and play fast and loose with the truth, this movie mocks the glorification, the vilification, the truth, the myth - everything surrounding this icon of popular culture. It does this so aptly with the ultimate TRUTH of any artist - his art. the songs are such a strong vehicle for character, story, tone, transition, subplot - all of it. It is the strength of the movie and underscores the power of this amazing artist. While you may not leave this movie knowing any more about Bob Dylan, you will have been taken on an incredible ride. As Dylan is an acquired taste for most, so is this movie. I highly recommend."
2,Confusing and boring - a brave failure from Todd Haynes,"""I'm Not There"" is a brave attempt to capture the essence of the enigma that is Bob Dylan. Director Todd Haynes goes out on a limb with some artsy manouvers: firstly, a whole series of actors depict different sides of Dylan's personality, secondly a lot of the biographical information is skewed or simply made-up, and thirdly the film consists of a number of vignettes based on actual performances and interviews rather than telling a story. Sadly the film is a failure. The multiple actors are off-putting, the fictional elements are confusing, and without any narrative thrust the whole thing soon becomes very boring. The liberal use of Bob Dylan's music is the only thing that redeems it. Better to watch Scorsese's documentary ""No Direction Home"" if you want to get closer to Dylan."
1,Totally Disappointed,"I have bought just about anything offered on Bob Dylan. Never did I imagine I would be so totally unhappy with this last offering. What ajoke, we get to see glimpses of Mr. Dylan around this total chaos of abiography on his life. I am glad I wasn't there when this farce was filmed."
5,fun but not for people who want cause and effect,"there are threads that connect the multiple versions of Dylan here. but if you're the kind of person who wants a movie to make sense, just move on. If you're in the mood for a movie that is great to look at, filled with some good (and some bad) covers, and has some great acting (thankfully Christian Bale doesn't speak too much).Basically, this is a movie that's not for everyone. And it doesn't make you stupid if you don't enjoy it. But I will say this -- you don't need to know much about Dylan to like it. My wife knows some of his music, but nothing of his biography and she really enjoyed it."
4,This movie will endure,"I am not even a big bob dylan fan, but this film is so well told and creative that it's the best I think of the year 2007 - understood it's non linear and a bit confusing but perfect for those times (and maybe these)."
2,I just wanted to be on the side that's winning.,"A class disappointment. Maybe the biggest disappointment of 2007. The film is self-indulgent, my interest in Dylan is genuine and has been. I am not a fanatic mind you and I have little care about what the great man was like, let alone it being described my six very infuriating characters and acts. While watching the film, I was confused, there was nothing interesting. While fans of the film might argue, you have to be open to the whole new way of directing a film, I must admit this film left me in a bad mood and feeling rather indolent. The best thing about this film is the fact that it ends. And one more thing I might add, I actually hold it against the great man (Bob Dylan) for allowing them to make something like this. Don't be curious. Avoid."
1,Zero Stars!,"Probally one of the worst movies I've ever seen, no joke. Maybe you had to be a die-hard Dylan fan to like this, but I didn't feel this film one bit."
1,Piece of garbage,"This ""thing"" or whatever you choose to call it is just plain bizarre.It's a totally random film editing job that has all the look and feel of a first term film making student who is on LSD or a 2 yer old cut loose with s set of finger piants.Absolute waste of money and precious time even if rented verses bought.Do yourself a massive favor and avoid at any cost."
2,Pretentious.,"I could barely watch this film. If you want to know Dylan, just listen to his records. No need to watch this film. Listen to his albums from early years and then the later ones as he evolves. Or read a bio of him. After seeing Don't Look Back and the Scorsese film, this movie is decidedly unnecessary. As useful as a remake of Psycho.Probably because I lived through those Dylan years from Newport and remember when he plugged in and how upset I was, that scene rang true. I recovered and became a fan.To learn about Dylan, read Baez's A Voice to Sing With and get her look at the real Dylan. He is/was pretentious or maybe the press made him pretentious. Doesn't matter. His music is what counts and skip the film and put on his music."
2,Redeemed by the soundtrack,"Innovative approach to the life of an often mystifying person, but the final result is, for all but the most ardent Dylan fans, overly long and not really as interesting as the premise made it out to be.For those of us who like Dylan's music even if we are not so intensely followers of his whole life story, the best thing about the film is the soundtrack. Lots of great Dylan songs, original or covered. I rented this at Family Video for a dollar, so it was like a cheap music download; glad I didn't invest any more in it."
1,Big Disappointment,"In my opinion this CD was awful. All songs on this CD were written by Dylan but performed by various artists giving their own renditions, which were hardly recognizable Dylan songs. The only song on the CD actually sung by Dylan is ""I'm Not There"" which does not even sound like Dylan. The only song on this CD that I really like is Goin to Acapulco by Jim James and Calexio. If you are looking for the classic Dylan/Sound music that some of us grew up with, this CD is not what you are looking for."
2,"sort of interesting, but ultimately disappointing. Blanchette was awful.","Sorry folks, this movie is so confusing it is not worth your money or time. And, I disagree with most of the others, Blanchette's performance was awful-- she was never convincing as Dylan or as anything other than a woman self consciously trying to play a man. For me, it was the most painful part of the movie to watch-- and there is a lot to choose from, unfortunately. And why even cast her-- except as a gimmick? It certainly didn't lend to any credibility, which the movie desperately needs. Too bad, I'm a huge Dylan fan and really was looking forward to this movie. I couldn't even finish it."
1,Painful,This movie sucks! Artsy-Fartsy nonsense. Don't waste your time. An insult to real Dylan fans.
2,"Makes Dylan Look Like A Buffoon, Blanchett as Dylan is Awkward","The movie captures so little if any of the beauty of Bob Dylan. It makes him look like a flake and a buffoon. I imagine it is hard to portray such a complex character, but this movie seems to do such a poor job of it. Blanchett as Dylan is awkward in every scene that she plays him. It transcends androgyny and makes Dylan look overly feminine and freakish. It was hard to get lost in the movie during these scenes. I was not there and only have his music and video as a reference for what I think Dylan was like, but the movie reeks of hollywood's touch and feels like a characture that catches much more of the bad and bizarre than the genius of Dylan."
3,Three And A Half Stars for Seven Seals,"I was looking to get some Primal Fear because I heard some music from them and read many reviews and liked what I heard. From this I learned about them and thought they were very good. I only wanted to buy their best music, and from what I have heard and read Nuclear Fire and Black Sun were their best, but many people said good things about Seven Seals too. I am sorry to say I was disappointed with this disc. It is boring compared to Nuclear Fire and Black Sun. It sounds very basic. If you want a heavier faster feel go for Nuclear Fire and Black Sun. They are my favorite albums from Primal Fear, and arguably their best."
5,worked,this worked for along time it held a charge for longer than i ever expected super cute in person and very fun for little tots
5,Excellent Source of Knowledge,"This CD is just fantastic ! Being a medical student... I was in total awe when Professor Peter Abrahams presented this to our class. Never was my attention so focused on one thing. I highly recommend this CD to any person in the medical field and who is interested in having an excellent grasp on the Anatomy of the Human Body. This CD gives a 3D aspect on every aspect of the human body - bones, muscles, joints etc and that's just the beginning. This is definitely one you should have as part of your medical resources."
5,Tickled to find a great tick remover,"We had bought Ticked Off a few years ago and it has saved us (no dogs involved) enough times with its simplicity of use that we bought about 10 in order to be able to give them to family and friends. In a minute or less, the tick is gone; the trick is being patient enough to find it in the first place..."
5,buy it,"This is the best tick remover I've ever used on our dogs and cats. Easy to use and seems to get rid of the whole tick with minimal discomfort to both tick and pet. Not that I really care about the tick! The tick can easily be dropped in the toilet. Here's a hint: if a tick is seen crawling---catch it with tape, then dispose."
5,Get more than one,"This is a truly great tool and I'm now ordering two more -- one more as backup for the dogs, one for us. We live in a tick intense area. I've tried everything, including extremely fine tweezers, with some success, but ONLY this small spoon remover gets the whole tick, every time, mostly with no visible after effect (that depends on how embedded the tick has gotten -- regardless, the tool removes the WHOLE tick)."
1,Useless device,"I've been removing ticks for years, and this tool is a very crude approach to tick removal. I just found a tick on my dog-- first of the season-- and tried (for the first time) using this tick tool which I had bought several years ago. It is a BLUNT object and I spent 15 minutes trying to remove a moderate-sized tick with it and finally gave up in frustration. There are better devices on the market. Don't waste your money."
4,Second effort much better,"Greg's second book is a great improvement from his debut ""Horror Show"". In Horror Show you knew the ending far before the end of the book, espically if you saw Ed Wood! But Shade of Pale is a vast improvement in both writing and story. This is a fast read, but the story propells the reader along at a comfortable pace. And as the story unfolds the conclusion is arrived at just the right time. A great lazy afternoon read!"
2,I love Greg's song; but keep practicing your writing skills,"The story starts off ambitiously enough with some interesting elements: psychiatry, fashion photography, the IRA, and the Banshee. The first half of the book has some good scenes that set the story in motion. The second half of the book unravels and the cliches pile up. The plot elements become very predictable. It is almost as though the ending was rushed to meet a deadline. Next time take the time to polish the story and finish strong."
4,Beautiful Merry Christmas,"I don't have much to say except that Tori has the most sad and beautiful version of ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" that I have ever heard in my life. That's the reason I bought the c.d.! If for nothing else, buy it for that song!"
2,Baby grace,"I have finally given this baby as a gift, I have to say that it's not what was expected. Her hair was a mess, I tried brushing with a soft bristle baby brush but the hair continues to come out. The babies face is not the same as the one in the picture, as I had stated in an earlier review, not the baby I was expecting to have her hair falling out, she will be bald before long, and that does not make me a happy customer!"
3,This book is about some cool monster trucks,I think this book is good and it was fun to read it shows lots of cool monster trucks and some weird tracks and how they got famous. This book had cool pictures and it was a good book
3,Good for school,I have to have this book for one of my classes and some of the essays are very enlightening and interesting.
5,Sturdy and attractive,The stand is perfect for a full size guitar. It is sturdy and does not tip over. I would recommend to all.
4,A differnt side to your favorite band,"At first listen to this disc, you immediatly notice a particular departure from their previous album. Although the grind elements exist on this record, they don't have the insane impact as they did on ""Soundtrack"" but rather, ideas are well placed and executed with precision and passion. Definatly a slight difference in how their song writing was approached, but it is welcomed!"
1,Dangerous! High Sids risk,"I have serious concerns about a product that shows a child sleeping on their belly weighted down with a bean bag. First the bean bag itself could present a risk as it keeps the child from being able to clear his head. Secondly, one of the reasons babies are at risk of SIDS while on their bellies is because they sleep more soundly. If this increases the depth of their sleep then you are putting them farther at risk. I am shocked that this product is allowed on the market though I expect there is probably a disclaimer that says not to allow your baby to sleep on her belly while using it."
1,This is wrong,These Bratz dolls are horrible looking. My daughter received this doll for her birthday and I returned it. This kid looks like a mini gang-banger. There is nothing positive about this line. I hope that it is a phase that dies out quickly.
2,Chipmunk Adventure soundtrack,"half the songs on the CD were not the songs originally from the movie. They either did not come from the movie, or were changed from the original.It sucked!!"
4,Decent combination of Science Fiction critical scholarship and writers' commentary,"This is a mix of scholarly essays and science fiction author commentaries on the genre, all assembled in 2000. Some of the essays are available online. The overarching theme is that of the frontier. Probably worthwhile for scholarly work, or to check out from the library. Copies are too expensive new for such a thin volume for general interest."
4,Item Received,Have not had the chance to watch video yet but cannot wait to see! It was a favorite video of mine growing up and am so happy to have found!
4,Cameron looks liek his Monny dressese him,"What is up with poor Cameron? he looks like his Mommy dresses him. he has no style and no panache . He has good hair and great eyes, so he has lots of potential but this outfit is only funky in the original meaning of the word i.e. it stinks.Only cool features are the shades and bag."
3,I'm A Little Confused?!,"I looked at this doll on toysrus.com and I really liked the idea of it having a little beard. I thought that although I own 3 other Camerons I would consider asking for this doll for my 16th birthday. I went to ToysRUs to see what the doll looked like in real life and was a little confused. The funk out Cameron wasn't the same doll as the one shown above. It came with different clothes and didn't have that beautiful little beard. The box told me it was a Cameron Funk Out doll, but I couldnt seem to locate the little beard. I am a dedicated Bratz Lover but I am a little confused. And I'll end this review on that note."
5,Happy happy,Friend really enjoys the item and so do I cause its exactly what I purchased and came right on time. :-)
3,"Good book, doesn't have enough excitement in it.","The book could be much better. It wasn't exactly the greatest book. It didn' have very descriptive language. Good story, but the author could have put more detail."
3,Used by the master,"I have never read this book but it appears to be the book referenced by George Lindsay in his ""An Aid to Timing"" pamphlet. ""Fluctuations"" enabled him to examine stock movements back to 1795 and devise his model of Middle Sections. In this pamphlet, or brochure, he, for the first time, explains his Count from the Middle Section. ""An Aid to Timing"" was published in 1950."
1,Not worth the price!,I was very dissapointed when I opened the box. Not the thickness and quality I expected. Not worth the price!
1,Now this is just laughable,"When I reviewed the Ultimate Codes for Pokemon DS games, I said that you shouldn't have to buy another Action Replay, that has the same codes as these dumb things, for the same system. But isn't Wario World a short game? I'm pretty sure you don't need cheat codes....Besides, the cheat device even manages to help me bust ANOTHER gut by having to cost 2 or 3 times the price of a used copy of Wario World! Jeez."
5,"Wow! A ""must own"" for everyone.","This is the best datebook of its kind that I have seen. Her organization ideas are brief and to the point, easier to remember and apply during a busy day. The book is set up to use either for appointments or as a journal. It will sure solve my holiday gift selection for my clients."
5,golden oldie,"I purchased this DVD after seeing a promo on the Encore Western channel, which reminded me of the movie that many in my family liked. We have watched it and enjoyed it. I have also loaned it to others as a good movie that has a minimum of violence(compared to many westerns) and alot of comedy. Thanks."
5,Excellent discovery,"The CD contains 6 concertos for violin, strings, and bass continuo from Albinoni's opus 10, which was dedicated to the Marquis of Castelar, Lieutenant-General in the army of King Philip V of Spain. This work was totally lost/forgotten until a copy was re-discovered in 1968 in the castle of Leufsta, in Sweden.In addition to the bass continuo, Albinoni chose the following strings for the concertos: 3 violins, one viol, and one cello. All 6 concertos are rather short (total time is less than 53 minutes), and are in the same 3 movements: Allegro/Andante/Allegro. The music is breezy and delightful, often giving primacy to the first violin. The performance of the well-known ensemble I Solisti Veneti is, as usual, excellent."
2,Bark with little bite,"While this is the only book I could find with direct reference to VoiceXML, ASP and SALT, it was a dissapointment. The title says VoiceXML 2.0, but the major examples are all given in 1.0 syntax. There are many errors and the formatting is poor. Finally, there is no discussion about mixed-initiative applications or natural language processing."
4,Profiles in Green & White,"The articles on the individual coaches & players is very informative, this alone makes it a must read for any Eagles fan. There is also a comprehensive record of individual & team records plus a year by year run down on the team. The only thing missing is a won-lost record overall, by teams, home & away. Would make a great gift for all your Eagle die-hards."
5,Best Book I've Ever Read---Must Have,"I am a [...] student and I have read the entire Eagles Encyclopedia. I am a consistent reader and, being one of the biggest Eagles fans, have to say this is my favorite book of all time. It consists of everything you want and need to know to be a true Eagles fan. I would even recommend this to non-Eagles fans. It includes:*The Frankford Yellowjackets*Bert Bell and the founding of the Eagles*All of the big time Eagles players in history*A complete recap of the Eagles greatest moments including The Miracle in the Meadowlands, Cunninghams 91 yard punt, 99 yards:Jaworski to Quick, and more.*An All-Time Roster*Scores and Schedule for every Philadelphia Eagles seasonand more!I highly recommend this book to everyone. Ray Didinger is an amazing writer and I also recommend his latest book ""One Last Read."""
4,Album is good.,"Style varies from Buffalo Springfield to Joe Strummer. Even though it may be a freshman release, songs like ""Western Town"" leave you realizing that this artist is tapping into something deep and real. Title track is nice and rowdy."
1,This isn't a real movie.,No dialog for most the movie. I stopped watching. It is just two women who strip and seem like they have some experience at it. I just don't get it. I wouldn't waste my time.
5,fear 2,Great b rated movie with lots of hot girls that tantilate you before your eyes. God bless these Russian nuggets because they are the diamonds in the rut.
2,wow,okay this one is well just dance sexy and more touching than anything the girls are hot but it like a strip movie then anything if want see i say rent before buy
4,THe picture of the crowd,"The picture of the crowd on the back cover was taken at New Paltz University, the fall of 1969 during a performance of the Jefferson Airplane. The show opened with the Youngbloods, then the Airplane,and the headliner was Joe Cocker. The reason I know is that my friends and I are shown in the crowd on the lp cover and we know where we were during each performance."
1,Very disappointing,"I bought this book thinking it would be useful for my work with Mexican Spanish. I was amazed to discover that my very tiny University of Chicago Spanish Dictionary was frequently superior, although that book does not claim to be specifically tailored to Latin American Spanish. On the whole I found this dictionary to be very disappointing, lacking many commonly used words in Mexico and other regions of Latin America, and very often insufficiently explicit regarding the countries and regions where non-standard or non-European variants are used. I really wondered how the book was written; my impression was that it was a rather old dictionary spruced up with a pretty cover, new typeface and the hasty addition of some regionalisms. It's also much heavier than the U Chicago Dictionary. Despite my every effort to like the book, I feel I wasted my money."
5,Great if your on the fence about Homeschooling,"This is a very informative book from a seemingly experienced homeschooling mother. Looks at ALL the ins and outs, ups and downs. I would recommend it for sure."
3,"No seriously, terrible sound","As another reviewer mentioned, this is a great example of terrible compression. I listen to more old music than new and know what analog recording sounds like and this is not it. I have a hard time listening to this album as music because of it."
5,Splendid performance of Bach,"I am rather experienced in orchestral, choral and church music. I do think this recording is simply splendid in both recording fidelity and exceptional playing. One cannot be disappointed, unless less than accurate perfomance is desired."
4,"Not bad, not bad at all","I guess to me it's highly debatable just how ""killer"" Relapse records is, but there's no arguing that this is a very good album.Burst is to grindcore what melodic death is to death metal. If such a genre existed, I would call this melodic grindcore. Very riff based with touches of alternative melody added to the mix. Influences range from Carcass to Tool. The music is versatile, going from crushing heavy passages to darkly melodic passages and even to acoustics occasionaly. If I had to pick a weak point it would be the vocalist. He gets the job done but doesen't utilize much beyond hardcore scream and emo scream. Other than that complaint, this is a very solid album."
2,Boring Sounds like 90yr old quiff,As I listened to this after reading reviews that this may sound like burnt by the sun i was getting pretty anxious to hear this i gave it 4 songs and heard nothing creative just boring ass riffs nothing i can even bang my head too this album is just rushed.
5,Great advice!,"This is a great book. I was a teen not too long ago. This book was a breath of fresh air. The author's tone is perfect throughout the book. She is well-educated but she also speaks to young girls as though she herself is still a teenager. The book covers just about everything a young girl is concerned about. The author gives healthy, practical advice to each question. I highly recommend it. This makes a great Christmas present!"
2,Slightly disappointing...,"I've heard so many good things about this group, and I was so excited when I finally got a copy of ""Perspectives"". While some of the singers have impressive voices, I felt like the album as a whole fell flat. They definitely have a very unique sound. I really wish I could get a chance to hear them live..."
4,landower legacy,victoria holt writes such entertaining books. I cna never trie of them and this one is just as good. worth reading!
3,just okay,I thought these athletic socks were go below the knee but they go far beyond my knees this making them quite uncomfortable to wear. The styling is good but for wearing I just wish the length would be below my knees
2,A View From The Other Side,"Author Joe Fenley presents us with a one-sided view of Richard Bennett, who happened to be my uncle. I am the Lyn Marker that is mentioned in this almost true crime novel. While many of Mr. Fenley's statements about my Uncle Dick's early years are factual, he is highly swayed by the Good family in the majority of this work. His relationship with Marcia Good's first husband at the Dayton Daily News makes for highly prejudicial reading. He did not, however, misrepresent any of the information that I offered to him. It was not mentioned in his book however that my uncle was finally convicted in Arkansas the same year that Bill Clinton was bidding for the presidency. The GUILTY verdicts in his case had been overturned by the Arkansas Supreme Court twice, but overturning it the third time would have reflected badly on the Governor's bid for Democratic nomination. I feel that this one-sided view of a man who I knew for over 45 years was highly biased.Lyn Marker"
2,No depth,"Please have a look before you buy! Be sure to checkout the vacuous tables that inform us, for example,that the ""Suspend"" operation""Suspends a task"" andso on for seven other task-related operations. Thisis a quibble, but I think the lack of content in thetables reflects a grave shortcoming of the book asa whole: there's just not much there. In my opinionpart of the problem is lack of specificity. I wishthat the authors had focused on a single real operatingsystem (e.g. VxWorks) with actual code examples ratherattempting the very difficult task of covering theentire real-time operating system landscape."
3,Just okay,"The book is well written but has a decided ""VxWorks"" slant to it even though this is not clearly stated on Amazon.com. If you are embarking on a VxWorks project....go ahead and get it. If not, then there are more appropo titles out there."
1,fluffy,"this might be adequate for some one that has never attended an engineering program of moderate caliber. i finished the whole book in a day, nothing technical, no math, coffee-table reading for serious engineers"
4,Good for newcomers to embedded systems,"The book walks you through all the steps of embedded systems development before going into the details of RTOS, which is the main focus of the book. It is a great book for the intended readers of the book, as stated up front in the book."
1,Do not have any details on how things work!!,"This book wasted pages with big fonts and hallow tables. For example this book states create_thread() function create a thread. No trace on how it create a thread, what create_thread() function actually do!!. The same kind of descriptions about all RTOS calls. This book might better appeal if it focuses on inner working of RTOS than vague descriptions about it."
1,No Book,I did not receive this book. Amazon has already charged me for it and on the track you purchase it says its delivered. The product was available from many vendors but I chose Amazon since I trusted it the most. I personally will not deal with them anymore.
1,Bad take off on Iron man.,"Acting school 101. lots of work needed to make this one go. Fight scene near the end was, "" Hey, Where did that guy come from?"""
1,Iron Man Want to be!,"I will not waste your time and money so in a few words ""s t a y a w a y"" from this so called ""movie"" Any TV series look better than this."
2,Pure CRAP!,"This movie has to be one the biggest pieces of crap I have ever seen in my life! I would not recommend it to Satan! If you like this movie, well there's no accounting for taste, but more power to you. Do not buy, rent or even download this, you'll regret it."
5,"An important book, updated by Ronnie Lichtman","I've read many books on the subject and this one is easily the best. Ronnie Lichtman C.N.M., Ph.D. is one of America's foremost midwives. Her writing style and expertise add new dimension to an already great book. It has everything an expectant mother could possibly want to know. Though there are many books on pregnancy and childbirth, this is the one that will be passed down to future generations. I recommend it highly."
5,a must have for expectant mothers,"This book is essential for expectant mothers. It covers in depth information on weekly fetal development, symptoms during pregnancy, preparing for the arrival of the baby, and birth and delivery. This book also covers multiple births, and family planning methods. This book gives detailed information on sexual organs and conception."
5,american classics-interviews,i am 65-grew up with this stuff and this i loved becouse of all the interviews with the different custom builders-
3,They're alright...,"I received them and had to wash them twice to get the ""smell"" off of them. I washed them per the stated directions, and yet they are not nearly as soft as they felt right out of the package.I'm pretty disappointed... but I guess I shouldn't expect much more for $30. I sincerely hope no one has ever paid the $120 retail price for these things! My other sheets that are thinner are much softer, and they only cost a few dollars more.Amazon was great though. They sent the wrong color, and fixed it immediately."
5,PERFECT for AIR BEDS and deep pillow tops!,"These sheets are VERY deep - I sleep on an air bed with pillow top and these sheets stay put plus fit PERFECTLY - the pillow slips are ALSO nice and roomy, great for BIG FLUFFY pillows, not so great for flat ones. The elastic washes well too, it does not stretch out at all. (this review is for the 320 thread count sheets - the 260 thread count are not as deep and the pillow slips are not as roomy - BUT the sheets do stay ON and wash well)"
2,disappointed,"sheets are full of wrinkles after being washed,not as soft as when new,and not the qualiy i anticipated."
5,Wonderful Sheets!,Silky soft and beautiful! I love these nice quality and roomy sheets! The extra pillowcases are fantastic too!
2,Slow & minimal info,"There was only 20 min of Jin Shin Do (type of acupressure that uses it's own different ways to classify points then acupunture.) which was set in a class & VERY drawn out & boring about how to do acupressure yourself which is very easy & simple.There was only 15 min on a few basic strokes & very little info on reflexology that would fill only a 20 page book.Visualization was also a disapointment where you only concentrate on breathing & what you feel & not be afraid to be more aware of your body lead by a woman with 2 other woman sitting & breathing while the teacher spoke. They discussed what they felt & they did do another visualization of reminding you of nature scenes you remember & concentrating on that, but it also could have been more uplifting & longer.All these only gave a brief overview & was a good start but barely scratch the surface of these great arts."
2,Old Friends disappoints,"Having been a fan of Simon and Garfunkel and knowing how good the Central Park CD was, I looked forward to hearing this concert. I was very disappointed to find cover songs and poor versions of old favorites.Do yourself a favor and listen to the Concert in Central Park CD. It is so much better."
2,"Just a bronzer; does NOT leave a ""tan""","I usually love Neutrogena products, but lately they are missing the mark on many fronts, including this one. It just ""bronzes"" your face, but once washed off it leaves absolutely zero ""tan"". Don't waste your money."
2,Just a Bronzer,"I felt that as a bronzer this product works okay. Unfortunately, I don't feel that it work as a self tanner. I could see it wash down the drain when I took a shower, and I didn't see any signs of a lasting tan after use. So basically, you have bronzer that *smells* like a self tanner."
1,Racist trash,"You know, not many books can be said to have lead to have inspired people to commit or condone murder. ""Mein Kampf"" is certainly one such book, and ""The Clansmen"" is definitely on this (thankfully) short list. The racist horse excrement in this book helped to start a huge Klan revival in the early 20th century which lead to hundreds, if not thousands of black men and women to be hung. I suppose the book is useful as a way of understanding the madness and commonality of racist thought in the united states both past and, to some extent, present, but I have to say a turd like this really makes me reconsider my stance against book burning."
2,Worked fine.,But did not have the power for the processor. When I installed it and could not make it work even though the numbers I ordered was on the old one!
2,It'sThe Little Things That Count,"I was disappointed in the fact that there was no random play for MP3 discs. Furthermore, I can't seem to go past track 09 on the remote. Needless to say, it makes it difficult to play tracks above 10 on an MP3 disc (which can fit 50+).In the end, the MP3 features really disappointed and so I find myself using the radio more than anything and for just a radio, you can find the same thing for a lot less money."
5,A happy customer,"Bought this after reading the reviews and Amzno delivered it real fast. Happy with the sound quality, basic operations, and light weight. A real rich set of features makes this a Good Buy."
1,miserable design in an attractive housing,"I agree with most of JulyGirl's comments, and would like to add a few of my own:1. The controls really are quite confusing. Why can't there be one set of common controls that work for both tape and CD?2. When playing an MP3 CD, one cannot use the fast-forward function. One can skip a whole track, but one cannot search to the middle of the track. I checked the manual, and it even says that one can't use the fast-forward function with an MP3 CD. Amazing! (The fast-forward function does work with ordinary CDs).3. When one turns off the unit, it forgets where it was playing. (The CD players in both of my cars remember where they were last playing and resume at the same location when turned on).4. There really should be an audio input jack.In summary, I am thoroughly disappointed.Phillip--Dr. Phillip M. Feldman"
4,Got it and love it,"I dont care what anybody says, I love this boombox, yes it dose take getting use to but it is an all around good unit, its loud and very clear sound makes it perfect for jaming out in the bedroom! the tape deck also works good, all tho I wish it had a counter and could be controled by the remote. Realy other than that its hard to find a box that has the clear power that this one has, infact I love it so much that I bought a second one today for my grage!!"
2,Also Disappointed,"I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago. What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback. I agree that it could have been better. It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last. You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore."
5,A good boombox,"I like this boombox. Its feature is good and not heavy. Price is ok. If the price can be lower, it will be a perfect boombox. The function is good for radio, CD, tape and MP3. But one disadvantage: when I try to record tapes from CDs by this boombox, the sound is not excellent. Until now, I have used for one year. I used it everyday for many hours. Everything is in a good condition."
4,Worth the $70,"Pros: Plays mp3 CDs with folders. Sounds good (for a boombox). Runs reasonably long on rechargeable C batteries (NiMH). Can switch from AC to batteries without stopping play. Direct track number entry (press >10, 2, 9, and you go to track 29).Cons: Sleep timer can be set for 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes -- 10, 20, 30, 45 would have been much more usable, or just direct-entry of the time. Volume buttons are a bit slow (no volume knob).I bought two of these -- one for each of my children. They both love it. They each put all of their favorite songs on an mp3 CD. It stays in the boombox all the time and never needs to be swapped. I would have preferred something that plays SD cards (no moving parts) and displays artist/song information, but for $70, I'm happy."
3,Unique system in boom box category,"Wanna looking for a boombox at affordable price having all stuff - CD-R,RW, Mp3 and cassette compatibilities in one system. Go for this Panasonic RX-D29. Sound is nice at its price but not beatable to SONY.....But Sony dont provide all above stuff in one boombox. One more word of caution for RX-D29 dont rely on remote will not serve you properly for a long time.Otherwise, look is amazing and light in weight perfect for a small sized room."
4,Good Quality and Sound,"I'm very satisfied with this product. The sound quality is very good for a small, portable boombox. I could have purchased a cheaper product at Wal-Mart (Durabrand), but I'm happy I made this decision. I don't play many CD's right now, but the boombox is also a great emergency radio should inclement weather leave me without electricity. My only negative comment is I had to purchase four AA and six C batteries for all systems to work (including the remote control)."
3,Declining Quality Control,"I purchased one of these last year from another vendor and loved it. Good sound, easy to scan stations, reliable CD play. The cassette controls also seem very solid - unlike the Aiwa it replaced.Yet, now I have received two defective units from Amazon, both of which I returned. The reason for this is that the volume down button is unresponsive. Amazon may have received a bad batch - b/c the identical model I tried at a nearby store worked fine. Too bad Panasonic quality control has diminished what otherwise seemed like a top notch product.So be a little cautious here when buying online."
4,It sounds GREAT!,"The sound is just wonderful. The remote is so convenient when listening to books at bedtime. Leave the ""Sound Equalizer"" button on and play the music louder and you'll swear you have surround sound. Just a great product for the money. I recently bought headphones and enjoy it even more."
4,This boombox is a keeper!,"Panasonic RXD29 has an extremely hard-to-find combination of features: CD, MP3, cassette, AM/FM, in this sleek and classy-looking, lightweight boombox. I want to play audio books on CD or cassette, as well as our extensive downloaded collection of Old-Time Radio (OTR) MP3's, while working on a variety of projects. The boombox format is essential; it goes to the studio, garage, kitchen, etc. The choice of AC or DC current, plus battery backup on clock and radio presets, makes it extremely practical, and the remote control adds convenience.Sound quality seems excellent for the price. It would rate 5 stars, but the controls are a bit small and complex, and the radio antenna seems vulnerable. Also, the hollow spaces in the back could be enlarged a tiny bit, or the remote reduced in size, so the remote could be tucked in.Despite these problems, I'm considering buying two more as gifts, and think it's a super value for the price. As my daughter said, ""Cool box, Mom!"""
5,Great buy,"a good book, illustrated examples not just text, easy strait foreward advice. I've bought this book 4 times for myself, friends and family. Anyone can follow this book.My only complaint is its not long enough, it covers things so indepth but in a way that anyone can understand it I only wish there was more to it.it has several different solutions for each issue, which helps because each dog, household, situation, person is different."
3,Music 2 write 2 review,This album lives up to its name.Its catchy beats and uplifting verses are ideal for a sunny day on the patio with a few beers or what ever mood your in.Each song compliments the next which helps the easy listening appeal this album has.It is a worthy addition to a collection.
2,"Standard Plot, Good Cast, Poor Direction...","""Aces N' Eights"" (the title has nothing to do with the story, BTW) revives the old chestnut about the railroad forcing landowners off their property, spiced up with names like Ernest Borgnine (as the most stubborn homesteader), William Atherton (as the nasty railroad bureaucrat, naturally), Casper Van Dien and Bruce Boxleitner (both quite good as gunmen who develop consciences) and Jeff Kober (looking eerily like Denis Leary as the most bloodthirsty of Atherton's men). A minuscule budget and pedestrian direction (by Craig R. Baxley) does the film in, with poorly-staged action scenes, continuity problems, and an annoying reliance on tight close-ups.It's all been done before, and done better...""Aces N' Eights"" is for undiscriminating western fans only!"
2,A excellent plot concept ruined,"To the films credit, it has a excellent cast and great story line of redemption. The problem with the film is that the screenplay seems to not focus enough on the redemption of the main character. The main character Luke, was a gunfighter who used to ride with a gang and he eventually left after a massacre they committed. The film instead focus almost entirely on the villains and their murders of the families who refused to leave their land because of the railroad, this was wicked distracting and made me extremely uncomfortable. When the main character Luke, played by Casper Van Dein, came onto the screen, it seemed to me that all of his scenes were small and they disappeared quickly. So I gave this film 2 stars because of the lack of focus Luke and the glorification of the villains and their killings. So, it was not the greatest western ever made. All in opinion."
2,Okay Western,"Just an average Oater. If you like westerns as much as I do, you'll love it for what it is. Classic good vs. evil cowboy flick plot. As a movie the wife might like to watch with you, forget it. Pretty lame and a bore as far as a movies go. For (baby-boomers and beyond) Guys only."
2,Ernie is the reason for both stars...,"This is a tired and very played out story...the acting is pretty hack level and the direction is by the numbers. Ernest Borgnine is a gem and everything he does is ""authentic"" while pretty much everything else feels a notch below a quality movie of the week circa 1972. Bruce Boxleithner's paunchy brown toothed gunslinger isn't bad though its a cliche part/character. I wasted 9 bucks on it...don't go out of your way to find it on cable. I love westerns...this isn't going to do ANYTHING for the genre."
1,Pretty Bad!,"Haha! We have to laugh when we remember how terrible this movie is! After watching it with my family, we looked at each other and said, ""That's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life!"" The acting was bad, the storyline was okay but it could have been so much better. There was one good fight scene (otherwise we would have given it 0 stars!) It definitely wasn't worth the money spent and the time to watch it."
3,I didn't hate it...,"It was cool seeing Bruce Boxleitner and Ernest Borgnine in a movie again, but the plot was pretty predictable."
3,I don't have this book,I don't recall ever receiving this item. I have gone through my text books and it doesn't look like I have it.So I can confirm if I like the book or not.
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is completely horrible. Every attempt the author makes at creating an interesting story falls flat on its face. I have a good feeling the good reviews for this are probably from the writer's friends being that he so graciously reviewed his own book for us, without actually reviewing it. I bored this book from a friend and I wish they could get their money back."
1,II Wish I Could Give This Less Than One Star,(...)ANYONE could have written a s--t book like this in the span of twenty or so minutes. Are we just supposed to be amazed that a half-dead mental patient actually got out of his soaking wet bed and typed gibberish into a word processer? The fact that this book was even printed by a local Kinko's is a joke and an insult to the publishing industry. This crap SHOULD have been shelved PERMANENTLY? Give me a break!
2,Ashlee Simpson,"Personally, I'd rather listen to Ashlee Simpson singing show tunes than read even one page of J. Mark Kulik's book. And that's saying alot because I LOVE books. Alot. Ok....truthfully, I'm really not into reading books and I do find Ms. Simpson's singing delightful. Hhhmmm...Alright you want the truth? J. Mark Kulik is my dad and I'm using this forum as a way to vent my anger because of the thousands of dollars he owes my mom and I in child support. I know you're probably making millions with this book deal, dad - now it's time for you to step up and be a father for once. I love you! ...and if Ashlee Simpson is reading this....could I get some free tickets to your show?"
2,huh?,This book was more exciting than the first time i explored myself while listening to shaggy!Boombastic!Jeff Mark Kulik is a genious and quite frankly puts shaggy to shame.
3,high quality good color but,"I like the chair and the quality and color are great. But the handles get in the way. I am 5 feet 8 inches tall, 170 pounds. At first I thought I might be too big for the chair. It is on the small side. But after consideration I realized the main problem is the handles. The handles sit very far forward which is convenient for resting one's arms but the drawback is that my legs are always pressing against them and this is annoying."
5,An awesome story by an awesome author of Fantasy!,"The final battle is about to commence!Lokith returns for revenge against Bloodsong and Guthrun. He is to pave the way for the Goddess of Death, Hel, to overtake the Earth.By the sides of Bloodsong and Guthrun, remain the Freya-Witch (Huld), the shape-shifting Berserkers, and some ex-slave/warriors. However, to win this final battle Bloodsong must accept her shape-shifting abilities, just as Guthrun must risk using the newly awakened Hel-power within herself, without losing their true selves. ONLY THEN could they reach the lair of an ancient army that waits for Bloodsong to awaken them. Then they would have the chance to send Hel back to Hell!*** An awesome conclusion to an extra ordinary trilogy! These books are ""Keepers"" to be read many times over! Author, C. Dean Andersson, has proven his skill for weaving magical stories of unforgettable characters. Highly recommended! ***"
3,Roman History From Coins:Some Uses of the Imperial Coinage,While I found the book interesting I found it very distracting to have to flipfrom page of text to the back of the book to find the correct plate and illustration of the coin referred to in the text. Sandwiched between the text and plates are found notes and the index-all in that order. On the plus side there is a wealth of history covering a large part of the Empireas well as the people in power.
4,roman histury from coins,I found that the book was very informative and interesting...It explained the evolution of the empire through the coins produced by different Roman leaders
2,Crap,"So, I was previously the guy ""Avengedsevenx88"" and I have a second take on my review 3 years later. I recently popped this cd into my car stereo system a few days ago for nostalgiac reasons, and thought ""wow, I haven't heard THIS in awhile, this should be great."" I was wrong, this is the sloppiest cd I have ever listened to. Everything from the vocals to the mixing is horrendous. Oh, and especially the drumming. This guy can't hold a tempo AT ALL, and it sounds like they rushed through the whole creation process and didn't even use a click track. A breakdown on the second track halves in speed half way through the breakdown from the drummers kick pedal fatigue. One track will have too much treble, and the next too much bass. The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is for some genuinely novel guitar riffs, and some decent song structures. But honestly, why I ever listened to this band in the first place, is beyond me."
2,"Adorable, but didn't fit","I'm wondering if anyone else had this problem, but the switch plate did not fit right over the switch. The screws weren't long enough or something. I was disappointed because it's so cute!"
3,would've liked a double,I love the switch plate. It is sooo cute. I have chosen this theme for our new baby's room but we have a double switch in the nursery and I can't seem to find one to match. Wish Babies R Us carried a double one.
2,wish they made a double,"This item is very cute and goes with the Locomotion Nursery Decor that I purchased. However, I could not purchase the switchplate because the single is the only one sold. I have a double in the nursery.Danielle, Ca"
4,cute...but did not fit,"This switch plate looks so cute in my son's room, but it did not fit the light switch properly. You may have to use longer screws for the plate to fit properly."
3,broader influences,"Well, this is certainly interesting terrain for B/S. I don't agree with other reviewers who think this is a return to earlier albums. If anything I think they've expanded their musical touchpoints. They seem to have spent more time pulling tracks out of 70s mellow rock (""Roy Walker"" could be the b-side to Starland Vocal's ""Afternoon Delight"") and early 80s new-wave(""Stay Loose"" is Elvis Costello meets the Roxy Music with a splash of The Cars). While it's definitely uneven and I think that they've lost some of that ethereal quality that gave such drama to ""Don't Leave the Light on Baby"" and ""Waiting for the Moon to Rise,"" I think that overall we're seeing them taking the first step in an evolution that hopefully promises better recordings in the future."
3,3 because i'm not sure yet,"two weekends ago i was in a bar here in houston called onion creek. the music there wasnt all that bad. we drank for a few hours and decided it was time to go. just as i was finishing my last beer, they started playing if youre feeling sinister the whole album through! so we had a few more drinks as i refused to leave while it was playing. that album IS belle and sebastian to me. i bought the new album this afternoon and listened (if you want to call it that) to it once through. so far i think it sounds like 80's music that sucked in the 80's. i'll really have to listen to it a few more times to get into it i suppose but if youre looking for a great b&s album get either if youre feeling sinister or the boy with the arab strap. the other guy who reviewed this album before me sounded pretty pumped about it now and it seems he shared my dismay with it at first. maybe like him though, it will grow on me. heres hoping it does!"
5,"I did ""marry"" this album.",It's cool to read the reviews of new B&S fans. Also good to see that oldtimers are still grooving to the band. This is definitely an album to marry if B&S is your thing. Definitely one of my personal favorites.
1,my ears did bleed!,"what went wrong? is this a cover band? regretfully it seems that belle and sebastian have drained the well dry... if you want only fond memories of this band, don't buy this album."
1,A Let-Down,"I am a big fan and was eager to hear the new album. Unfortunately, after listening to it all week, trying really hard to like it, it still sounds like a sappy collaboration between the Beach Boys and the Brady Bunch."
3,plaid...with stripes,"This CD is like when you wear plaid with stripes. It is a mixed up-don't know what I wanna be sorta problem. The band sounds great but it is too much of this and that. It sounds a bit like something you know from the past and then it switches to something else from the past. Sorry, but that is the only way to explain it."
2,Fear part-apathy tunesmiths,"2 1/2Thankfully they got over this little creative hump, but everything in DCW sounds like a band's swan song in its lack of fresh ideas and simple energy. What may sound to observers as their surface-beauty best sounds to me like one of their worst written albums, relying on dolled-up generic songwriting and pointless different direction more than ever to seemingly appease a fan base without much else in mind."
2,It could have been a brilliant EP,"A couple of strong songs and two or three curiosities, but mostly duds--a huge disappointment. (I've listened to the album at least forty times, so these are not initial impressions.)"
5,Return to Form,"After the disappointing release Storytelling and the mildly disappointing Fold Your Hands the band returns to form with this one. Stuart Murdoch is finally able to resassert himself. Don't get me wrong the other musicians are average to good. But Stuart is the heart and soul of the band like Stipe is to REM even though he is surrounded by some pretty good people. Stuart is not too proud to call the shots on this one and forget all the mistakes he made democratizing the songwriting and singing. By stepping in front again the band rediscovers its true self and they're ""back again"" from their sinful experimentation. The instrumentation is excellent. The album is complex and keeps you interested. Piazza and Lord Anthony have the best music and I'm a Cuckoo has the most vivid lyrics ever from Murdoch. I can't get that particular song out of my head just like I couldn't get Sleep around the clock or Get me away from here out of my head."
4,Excellent Pop That Manages Not to Cloy or Clot,"I chose this album nearly at random after a friend recommended the band to me. He knew that I adore a good tune (I'm a huge XTC fan) and thought I'd like B. & S.He was right.What I particularly like about this album is that it has a somewhat consistent and uniform approach to its excellent songs and production. (The lack of which I find sometimes annoying with a roughly analogous band like The New Pornographers.)This might be partially credited to producer Trevor Horn, who has also and inexplicably produced albums by both Yes and Frankie Goes to Hollywood!So, why do I like it? The tunes! The songs are well crafted, have thoughtful, clever lyrics, and they are eminently catchy. While seemingly simple combination is, in fact, rare and priceless. Based on this, I'm absolutely going to explore the rest of the B. & S. catalog, though I must say, the bar has been set high with DEAR CATASTROPHE WAITRESS."
4,Has the potential to grow on me,"I just got this today, and I have to concur with the sentiments that this is indeed a different-sounding Belle and Sebastian than we've come to expect. However, to borrow an EC title, I couldn't call it unexpected because anyone familiar with the latest EP (I'm Waking Up to Us) or even the Legal Man disc could see they have the inclination towards breezy pop. So far I can say this is sure to be something I'll have to listen to more before I form a concrete opinion of, and it may very well be that there's too much sweetness spread over an entire album (B&S have had some classic EPs) but at this juncture I think it's a worthwhile purchase."
4,The new Belle and Sebastian!,"If you don't like this album because of having listening to ""Tigermilk"" ""If you're feeling sinister""or ""The Boy with te Arab Strap"", please, don't spoil others people listening!This album is GREAT, and it's not like the ones aforementioned. If you like sunny days, if you like and ice cream and the girl next door (but you were not able to talk, but in your dreams you were walking hand to hand), this is your Belle and Sebastian's album.Not overproduced, because it's an ""outrospective"" album; not silly, because it take much more intelligence to make a album of happiness than one of misery. Murdoch has mastered both sides of the mask: the smiling and the suffering. A pop masterpiece that could be your first aproach to a band called Belle and Sebastian (but take in count that there's another band of the same name who has signed three beautiful albums named ""Tigermilk"", ""If you're feeling sinister"" and ""The Boy with te Arab Strap"").Enjoy! Life's beautiful (sometimes, indeed)"
3,Belle & Sebastian on Prozac,"I'm disappointed with this CD. After listening to it a couple times, I can tell it will be a CD that I will force myself to enjoy. Belle and Sebastian are sad and meloncholy and this CD is NOT! I can't even listen to the first two songs. They just have this cheap, crap pop sound. Where are some songs like the Fox in the Snow?"
3,"Bright, lilting, catchy, melodic, whimsical, upbeat pop music.","This cd is all of these things, as well as being pretty, clever, witty and ever so easy on the ears. On the other hand only a couple of the songs remain with me after the cd wraps up. This comment isn't a criticism at all - in my musical life there's lots of room for a variety of musical styles and that includes sugary pop like this. Three and a half stars."
1,Steady Downhill,"This band is now a complete tragedy. I have followed them since the onset of Tigermilk, good album, then to sinister, great album, then to their pinnacle The Boy with the Arab Strap, pure excellence. It has been all downhill since. I have no idea what direction they've been trying to go in. I have no idea who they are now. It befuddles me that they have gone steadily downhill with the last two albums that I don't even no the names of because I try to block it out and pretend that the band broke up after Arab Strap and walked off into the sunset."
1,Total Rubbish!,"I have read some of the apologists below that seem unable to call a spade a spade. Face it folks - B&S are no longer entertaining or interesting, but just sappy, wimpy bores! It amazes me how a band can peak in their TEENS, and then waste away. All the songs sound like silly productions from a high school musical. It's over folks, It is totally over."
2,it just doesn't get much more boring than this!,"fans of belle and sebastian will be thoroughly rewarded with this new effort.because maybe you really like how belle and sebastian are just bigger wusses on every album, and you were worried because after that last album how could it really get any sissier?well folks, they've managed to do it. more songs about really pathetic things and how sad life is.if you like rock and roll, but hate that whole thing about rocking and rolling, then check it out!!!"
2,Horrifyingly disappointing,"I gave this album 2 stars because it's the worst B&S album to date. Here's why:1. The lyrics are corny. In past albums, they were able to take a moment or a situation and turn it into an endless ode (think Summer Wasting or Seeing Other People), or they'd tell a great story. In this album, almost every song is just another first-person song describing something that the singer feels, or something they went through.2. The music really is not compelling. I don't even mean the production of it, but just the basic song structures. They don't have that same enchanting magic they once have (String Bean Jean, Sing Jonathan David, need I say more?). The songs are very.. boring.That's basically it. I've ranked Belle and Sebastian in the top 2 for several years now, and was so excited to get this album. When I listened to it the first time, I almost cried because of how awful it is.If you're looking for a B&S album to buy, go for ANY of their older ones. They are all great."
5,A terrific novel - lots of fun!,"This book was so much fun to read I could not put it down, and I read it straight through in two sittings. The characters are captivating and believable, the action is non-stop, and the story is filled with surprises. I was sorry when it ended and continue to think about the characters. I'm hoping for a sequel!"
3,Outdated Information,"I enjoyed the book and as a person who also has suffered from Wegener's Granulomatosis I wanted to see how that storyline developed. I was a little put off by the outdated information contained in the book about WG, some examples 1. ""It is an old man's disease"" : now it is known that both men and women equally and primarly in middle age develope this disease. Also it stated that it was extremely rare with ""a few hundred known world wide"", it is much more diagnosed these days and I had a diagnosis within a few weeks of developing symptoms (I lived in a community of 13,000 at the time.) I am not saying the book isn't a good mystery because it is, I would just like the correct information to be read by the general public."
5,In Plain Sight should be seen.,Good stories and good characters made this series worth watching. I didn't catch on until the last season so went back and watched it from the beginning. Sad to see the series end.
4,In Plain Sight,"In Plainsight never fails. It's entertaining, smart and different. The characters have chemistry. The USA network has the best line up on television."
3,most of the time the picture is ok....sometimes digitally it sucks,I will miss the show last season on now ...but quality of this download is sketchy at best .....digitally breaks up several times during each episode
3,Final Season is a bit smaltzy,"If you want to get closure on the series (which was very strong and fun until the S4, then watch this. Cast and writers very clearly geting bored toward end, but still entertaining."
4,In Plain Sight Season 4 and 5,"This a really, really good show ..loved every episode. The main charactor is hilarious because she is so sexy, cocky and sarcastic and the stories are always interesting as well. You will feel like you are there and really know these charactors well. I wish this show was still running , can't get too much of it. If you like this one , you will probably like Covert Affairs too or vis versa. Warning, you will get hooked ."
1,Broken link,Same thing happened to me. Only got through 25 seconds. Where can I get my money back? I love this show and I don't want to miss a crucial episode.
4,Love Mary!,I am so sorry this Show has ended. It was awesome with some uniques stories and good actors. I look forward to seeing these guys in other shows. Off I go to reluctantly watch the last season..I don't want it to be over.
4,hibernatinginNH,"LOVE THIS SHOW, but it should be free by now!!! The two main characters are just the best casting job ever!!"
4,I love this serires!,Great series in my opinion. I love the different personalities and the combination of personal stories and Witness Protection Program.
3,We've enjoyed the series,Sorry to see this series came to an end. We enjoyed the characters and the situations. It was a good premise for a series.
3,In Plain Sight Season Four,"I'm more than a little confused about this --- how could there be a ""1 disk"" version of In Plain Sight - Season Four scheduled for release on June 5, 2012?? A single disk is not nearly enough for a full season.... and besides that, there appears to be a ""3 disk"" version already available, which is, incidentally, much more expensive than the upcoming June 5 release!! What gives????"
2,really stinks,"WELL I'LL TELL YOU!OUT OF ALL THE DVD'S I HAVE ORDERED THROUGH AMAZON I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN ONE SO BAD.THE SECOND DISK SKIPPED SO BAD IT WAS TERRIBLE,AND THE THIRD DISK WAS WORST.I AM DISABLED SO THE HASSLE OF RETURNING JUST AIN'T WORTH IT.I HAVE ANOTHER DVD(SEASON 5). ALREADY ORDERED FROM THE SAME SELLER AND IF THIS ONE COMES IN BAD I'LL BE DONE ORDERING DVDS FROM AMAZON!!!"
1,Plain Awful,"The writing on this show, at least this season, is so ridiculous it's laughable. The plotlines are shallow, trite, and poorly developed. The dialog tries way too hard to be funny. The actors look like they are in a panic trying to get through the MASS of quippy cutesy lines they are forced to say that have NOTHING to do with their characters. Makes for bad acting when good actors must say stupid things. Kids in film school write better than this."
4,Always compelling viewing...,"Another stellar season. Good character development, some great story lines and Mary is a gutsy character who is hard not to admire and respect.Definitely worth adding to your collection."
4,good show,I have been a fan of this show for a few seasons. I hated that I had to pay to watch an episode but its a good show.
4,Another great season,Definitely a little different season than I would have expected. Mary get pregnant in real life since she is pregnant on the show. New idea in the last episode for the cliff hanger. This shows grows on most people till they get addicted.
1,cant watch what i paid for,wish I knew what this season had in store... it wont let me watch what I paid for does anyone know what the deal is????
5,THE WAY METAL WAS INTENDED,"People, this is simply the way metal was intended right here, Hydrogrind! LUCID INTERVAL is pure destruction, it takes you places, musically, that I bet you've never been. CEPHALIC CARNAGE is the greatest grind/metal band ever to exist, their predecessors are put to shame with this album. I am A huge fan of these guys and have had the pleasure of seeing them play live. Take it from me, if you want quality grindcore purchase LUCID ITERVAL, as well as EXPLOITING DYSFUNCTION, CONFORMING TO ABNORMALITY, and ANOMOLIES. All these pieces of work are easily comparible to the creative works of classical musicians but in the never fading genre of DEATH and GRIND!"
5,Nugcore,"This new album by Cephalic Carnage is possibly the heaviest thing relapse has released since Mastodon's ""Remission"". Every song exept for the acoustic track is mindnumblingly heavy. Lucid Interval is probably the best grind song ever. Disc highlights:Arthro-Emesis- Great song about the ... rulers of Rome. Super heavy and very long for a grind song, around 6 mins.Pseudo- The first time I heard this I was overwhelmed. I didn't think anything could be heavier than Arthro-Emesis, but I was wrong. Ultra heavy break down. Very, very good song. Great musicianship.Lucid Interval- Wow. All I gotta say is wow. Skip to this song first when you buy the CD.I dont think anyone has played or will play music as heavy and technical as Cephalic Carnage. This is a landmark album and will be remembered by grind-freaks everywhere. And who says pot-smokers can't do anything?Some advice before putting in this album: consume copious amounts of cannibis before spinning it, it makes it all the better. Peace."
5,"Blast from the... well, 2003","I had to double check that this recording wasn't actually from the early sixties. This disc has a great retro sound, very mod and somewhat garage. This is fun music, not a dud track to be found. Why aren't these guys famous? This is so much better than most other ""new"" music. Fantastic fuzzy guitars and vocals that sound like early swingin' London. Highly recommended."
3,Black Dice - Smiling Off,"So even as DFA continue their takeover of the dance-rock world, the Black Dice are here to challenge the hegemony of the 'DFA sound.' Indeed, their single SMILING OFF seems to take more from Add N to (X) than from LCD Soundsystem. The ""DFA Remix"" cleans up the sound considerably, stripping the track down to funky electro-house with squelches. Luomo mellows things out even more, while ZZ Pot goes back to the original's more abstract root. Fascinating, even if it doesn't entirely make sense."
5,Smiling Off; slang for 'some wonderful drug'?,"This is what a single should be like.At roughly thirty-six minutes long, this 4 track single plays like an EP and holds its own throughout. It comes as no surprise that the centerpiece of the disc is the outstanding DFA remix, clocking in at just over nine minutes, with its catchy-as-hell pulsating beat and seizure-enducing disco freakouts. The Luomo remix follows suit with mind-bending soundscapes, yet cries for the dancefloor. The ZZ Pot remix crafts a perfect blend of noise and psychadelia, delivering an equally impressive skronk-fest that makes SY's ""Diamond Sea"" sound tame.This one could be on repeat for a while. Listen with caution."
4,works great but the fit was...,a bit loose on the connector when hooked up...just felt that the ends should have a closer tolerence ...but it works fine so I can not fault it....price is good also...
5,An Awesome Book,"If you like Charmed, the show, you will love this book. I have read every charmed book besides the 2 new one's and this one was my favorite. Phoebe is doing a school project and she runs into ghosts that spirits haven't Rest In Peace yet. Phoebe has to figure out how to stop them before she and her partner are killed at the halloween party at college. The ghost that will kill them believe that they are his ex-girlfriend and friend. Really good book and I love it!"
5,Charmedfan#1!,"If you love a good mystery, a lot of action, and some good hauntings (with Phoebe), then you'll love this book! I just recently read it and it was awsome! Prue, Piper, and Phoebe kicked some ghost ass!..."
4,Charmed by The Novel,"Another entertaining episode that has the Charmed Ones operate in an enchanting field. This time it's ghosts from the 50's that can't get their peace until the mystery is solved. Having read all 10 Charmed-books that have been published so far (or that I know of), I must say that this is not the top-thriller because I did find the characters of Brett and Marjorie and Wendy a bit flat. That doesn't mean the book is not good, it's just that the others were better because their characters were more lively."
1,Very Poor,"I've read nearly all of the books in this series and this one is by far the worst. The circumstances aren't believable in the least and it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do to simply get past the first few pages. I am very rarely critical of the books I read, but then again I also rarely read such garbage. And the worst part is, the creator of the show is the author. That came as a huge surprise seeing as how the characters took nearly the entire book to truly become the ones we know and love on the show. I pity whoever is unfortunate to read this Charmed book before any others because it would most likely deter them from reading the rest of the series."
2,A huge-o dissapointment,"I lovvvvve the show charmed, so i began collecting and reading the books. The first five were really great. Buy those. I was really excited when this one came out. Isn't Leo Piper's fiance in the show now? This book was completely not seasonly accurate, and was not very compellingly wrtten."
3,Eh...,"The plot was good/very interesting but the ending was a bit of a letdown.. it happened too quickly. There was a couple good twists and all but it seemed to me, like in 'Truth and Consquences', that the author just wanted to get the book over with. Good premise (nice that it showed Phoebe in college)... just not great execution at the end."
3,It was GREAT... until the end,"I am an older fan of the Charmed books and even though the writing style is geared more towards teen readers, I have enjoyed most of the books that have entered this series so far. Haunted by Desire was no exception until the end. The plot was nice, using Phoebe as its center while still including the other sisters. Then all of a sudden I guess the author decided ""Oh no, I've written too much, I have to finish it NOW."" The ending was too contrived. It happened quickly, everything was convenient and tidy. Too tidy if you know what I mean. It leaves the reader thinking ""Whoa it's over already?"" If you're a real fan of the Charmed series and just have to read Haunted by Desire, check it out at the library, don't spend your hard-earned money on it."
5,a hidden gem,"This is a sit-down album. Equal parts roots rock, country, and folk sensibility, it features 11 songs that are more than just catchy jingles. They did leave me humming them on the train to work, but that's not the full charm of the album. When I listened to them again, I realized on a closer listen that this album managed to pull off the feel of a singer-songwriter confessional. The songs could slip into cartoonish coverage of their subject matter (longing, searching, redemption), but never wallow in cheap theatrical tricks, lyrically or musically. Indeed, what struck me about the work was the fact that for a five-piece band, the arrangements were remarkably simple. The lyrics were insightful, delightfully quirky, and beautifully delivered. The album is worth buying for the achingingly gorgeous ""And Death Shall Have No Dominion"". A fabulous piece of work."
4,My Grey Parrot Likes this Food,"This review is more from my parrot than from me:From the mouth of Yuki-bird...""Tropimix tastes good. I prefer it to all the other food my human gives me (with the exception of spaghetti, pizza or a crunchy celery stick).""...and there you have it, folks, straight from the parrot's mouth. I like the idea that there's less inedible waste and that Yuki is pleased when I offer it to her, which makes me pleased."
2,"Nice Story, But Little Substance","This is a nice story about a man who had spent most of his life in prison and being drunk and starting fights after an absuive and neglectful childhood and who finally gets married, has a kid and straightens out somewhat, although never ceasing to be an alcoholic. Its the story of an oridnary man and the faxt that he is an Amerind does not really enter into it. Why anyone would really want to read it is an open question, however. It's a nice read, but nothing to get excited about."
2,512 pumps,"As nice as these pumps look, they are not comfortable at all. One of the buckle straps were short and hard to latch."
5,Who needs consumer guidance anyway?,"These reviews are so super-pithy that they make very entertaining reading, even when you have no interest in the record under discussion. (The entire review of Foreigner's first record reads, ""You've heard of Beatlemania? I propose Xenophobia."" Really, what else needs be said?) And his coverage is broad enough that you can easily calibrate the differences between your taste and his. It's great to see this still in print."
4,A great all-around climbing reference,"If you are looking for the one how-to book to own about climbing, this is it. Because of its grand scope (everything from how to dress to rock anchors and mountain weather patterns), it doesn't cover all the nuances and details experienced climbers may look for in a particular field.Still, this is a book worth owning. It is a MUST READ for new climbers and a great source for those wishing to branch out into other types of climbing (aid, alpine, ice, rock). I own several past editions and it just keeps getting better and better...."
3,Dated,"This book is a bit dated. I've read it a few times. Some of it is really good, but a lot of it is super old school. I still would recomend new rock climbers and mountaineers read it. It is a good start to learning, but it only skims each topic. If you want to learn ice you need to get Will Gads (ice and mixed climbing) book. If you want to learn alpine get the ""Alpine climbing"" book from this same series and the Mark Twight book (Extreme alpinism). Also get self rescue and climbing anchors."
4,great,"This book was a great find, alot of useful information and a great resource. This book is reviewed and updated on a regular basis."
4,nice book,"I had glanced at the book before, so I knew what I was purchasing. The book was in great condition (a few very minor tears in the cover, like the seller said was possible) and was delivered when the seller said it would be delivered. Thanks!"
4,Great Reference Book,"This is a great book to use as a climbing and mountaineering reference. It is packed full of information regarding almost any mountaineering subject. My main comment is that I consider this a mountaineering encyclopedia. --If I only had one book, then I would get the encyclopedia, but I prefer to read more in depth topics such as the ""How to Climb"" series by Long. I would get this as a reference, but get other books for specialized topics."
5,The mountaineering bible,Anybody who is serious about mountaineering must own this book. It has everything you need to know about the subject; anything from conditioning to how to tie a knot. It's an essential book about surviving and how to be a better overall mountaineer. You won't regret getting it.
4,"Great, but tries to cover too much...","I thought this book was in general great. I think the author could trim out some parts of the book just to focus maybe on core technical stuff. Overall, I feel it tries to do too much and ends up being too superficial in some areas.I'd have liked more coverage of various knots, for example.To summarize my feelings, the book is chock full of great information, but it's not exactly the ""bible"" simply because the entire field is too large for any single book to cover entirely. However compared to other single books on this topic, this one has no equal."
5,More than just climbing,"A great reference book with almost everything you need to know about surving in the outdoors. Oh yeah, and a lot of neat information on climbing."
4,amountaineering;/THE FREEDOM OF THE HILLS,"This is a staple text for training for mountain, snow country travel and activities. It touches on many important topics. There can only be so much room dedicated to any one topic, so it does lack depth on some subjects. It is an excellent starting point for mountianeering skills.A good read before any course or hands on training."
5,Get the most recent version!,I purchased a used copy of The Texas Gun Owners Guide from Amazon and found that with all the changes in the law that the version that I had was very much out of date and offered incorrect information because of changes in the law. Make sure that you purchase the most recent version. Otherwise the book is well written and filled the gaps from my recent CHL class. The author maintains a website and an email service to keep the user up to date on law changes.
4,Killer album!,"Hey, this CD is GREAT! There are some awesome tracks on it and I highly recommend it to any Beatles, Led Zep, or Sheryl Crow fans out there. A definite shining star in the midst of all the dark clouds that encompass the music charts today. Killer album. Enough to make any musician jealous. Can't wait for the next one!"
5,This CD rocks!,"Vesica Pisces is often compared to Melissa Etheridge, Sheryl Crow and similar artists. While there are some similarities, such a comparison misses the point that the group has a truly unique sound. This CD captures that sound through 15 great tracks (don't miss the hidden track), ranging from introspective bluesy songs to good old, foot-stamping rock. It's an excellent CD, both musically and lyrically. Get it!"
2,"Nice Fit , Sound Terrible","When I first opened the package and tried the headphones on I was very excited that I had finally found a comfortable set of headphones. When I plugged them into my mp3 player all of the excitement disappeared. I have never heard such poor sound out of a set of headphones! No highs, no lows, muddy midrange. Kind of reminded me of listening to the old pocket transistor radios of the '60s.I guess my search for a good set of headphones to use with my mp3 player continues."
2,Not so good,"This product hasn't really worked as expected. I have given my dog (yellow lab) the dosage recommended, but it just hasn't helped with his breath. I will try to increase the dosage and see it that works, but may have to continue holding my breath :)"
4,"Freaky owls, activism, and triumph over negativity","Since i am a Northwest transplant and OBSESSED with native american spirituality i was siked to read this book by a Yurok medicine woman. She gives some sorely needed insight into women's moontime ceremonies, herbs (ANGELICA!), and the meaning of some friendly and foelike animal spirits all over the country. Since i already fell in love with Sioux medicine people, my heart sang when she told of meeting Lame Deer and others, participating in a Sundance, and recieving full healing the Lakota way. I ate this book up."
4,A great book on Native Medicine Woman and Healing.,"While this book is essentially designed for women I believe it is equally useful for men. Tela shares her life experiences learning the old ways as an Medicine Woman in the modern world, she shares her struggles and her many blessings showing how difficult the path of a medicine person actually is. This book is a good companion to those written by her X-husband Bobby Lake Thom, aka ""Medicine Grizzly Bear. This is a must read for anybody studying the Native American Medicine path."
3,This book was about a 3 on a scale of 1-5,"If the book was a little better, it might have gotten more stars. If it was any worse, it probably would have gotten less stars. That pretty much sums it up."
4,A sober history of an intoxicating subject,"Shteir's thorough research is fleshed-out by her concise writing and moderate tone. This is a scholarly but entertaining review of how show-business from the early 19th century to the present has explored its outer limits, and how the clientele have responded. It will take its place in due course with contemporary accounts of gladiatorial contests, bear-baiting and the bullring: those times and places where entertainment as either the living spectacle, or the distant retrospective confronts us with just what sort of people we are, that we get our jollys in such a medium."
1,"Terrible Book, Poorly Written and Boring, too!","For any interested in the art of striptease, please don't waste your time with this book. It is trite and heady and there are many better books out there on the subject such as ""Striptease: From Gaslight to Spotlight."" It also appears many reviewers of this book appear to agree. They also express what I felt: that this author has a loose grip on relaying accurate facts and history.I suspect the author wishes secretly to be a stripper rather than a university theatre professor who gets terrible online reviews from her students. The author doesn't say much about what interested her about this subject."
5,Wix fuel filter,"Wix is a top quality auto parts brand but generally pricey too. Fits fine, had trouble removing hose from old fuel filter. I love wearing fuel on my shirt o.0"
2,Eddw1,"Sound quality is great for the price. However, volume control became defective after a few weeks use."
5,Tu pars dans le mauvais sens,"This film may not deliver in the sense that it is billed as a 'thriller' but it is still a very good film (psycho-drama may be a more befitting genre for it). The characters are very likable and relatable especially the husband whose heart is in the right place but who can see no alternative for dealing with his marital issues than to hit the liquor. It is a very well made film, each scene nicely composed and stylised although not over the top. The pacing is also good, although the ending lacks punch everything that occurs beforehand is intriguing (rather than chilling)."
2,Road Kill,"If I wanted to watch 2 hours of road ahead of a car then I'd get out and drive somewhere nice instead..A particularly tedious effort.. by the time any ""drama"" occured I was too hypnotized by the road to pay any attention. There is also an awful american style (and thus telegraphed) horror moment thrown in to truly condemn the film. Having a huge collection of world movies I am not easily bored! but this managed it!Sometimes when it looks as though nothing is really happening in a movie it really is because nothing is happening! Just because its French does not excuse it... Such a mundane thing as a bad marriage is unable to conjure up any tension in this manner."
2,THINK 1980S CINEMAX,"Yes, it's been decades since FOR YOUR EYES ONLY and Bunuel, and Carole Bouquet has no butt, but it's still nice to see her in this movie, even if it is for just a little while.The star of this movie is a George Castanza type who really knows how to down some beers (not wine), and the bars in this French movie are kinda sleazy, not quaint. Despite some classical music in the background, this movie comes off like some 1980s direct to Cinemax movie, and that's not a bad thing.This movie is more like THE HITCHER or SOMETHING WILD than any Hitchcock or Chabrol, though of course name dropping those two directors is better advertising. The scenes of drunk driving on a 2-lane road at night are scary/moody enough, there's the cliche of radio music interupted by news of a prison escape, and the cliched evil hitchhiker.No great thrills, but it's mostly fun, with a long episode akin to a trippy BARFLY."
4,Perfect,"I was looking for a band that mixed the influences of GWAR, Dolly Pardon, AC/DC, Carl Orff and the Jonas Brothers into one Album.Buy it, play it, live it"
4,STU MEAT SAYS,"i love this cd. these guys are killer. i didnt like much after this cd but they kicked ass with this one. cb song, clodhopper blues, devils night auction, really cool."
2,No so hot directions,"After purchasing this kit for my iPOD I was so frustrated trying to open my iPOD with the fear of ruining it, that after several days of attacking it with the tools supplied and mediocre directions, I simply gave up and sent my player out to a company to do it for me. It works just fine now and no damage. Apple sure doesn't want people other then themselves to get inside these things."
2,Broken after 6 months,Not pleased with this product. My husband used it for 6 months and now it is broken.
2,not what i had hoped for,was disappointed that there was nothing according to the title in the movie. second time i have bought a movie and not be what i had hoped for. not too bad though anyway. good movie script.
2,what do you expect when the star is named LeeLee Sobieski ?,"That is what you get. Nothing to brag about, hard to believe anybody can be that stupid. Even the deleted scene (1) was worthless. These is some skin in this movie so you would think the deleted scene had skin. Nope, a deleted 2 minute fight scene. The outtakes & stills were nothing worth watching as well.The plot was almost believable but poorly written & directed. There really wasn't any BDSM in the movie.I give this 2 stars only because LeeLee looks hot in the uniforms. Besides that, it doesn't have much going for it. Tricia Helfer looks much hotter in Battlestar Galactica."
4,walk all over me,"I've been looking for this movie to watch for some time, about a teen bully. she wound fight and get into trouble with the law.her friend's would get her more into trouble and to get raped from some one she didn't know."
1,Does not give what is promised.,This movie looks like a kinky thriller but is just lame acting and cheap sets. I would not buy this film.
3,few problems,"The picture is misleading. This ring is actually more gold, than silver, which threw me off, because I like silver much better. It's actually a silver base with gold painted over it, it seems like. I know this because the gold paint is peeling off of the top screw. Honestly, it doesn't bother me a whole lot, and it's not noticeable (kind of hoping it peels off and becomes just silver). Very cute, very comfortable, overall I'm happy!"
4,AC Voltage detector,This AC induction probe works. I wish it had a bit more sensitivity (it works poorly with heavily insulated wires and power cords). With it I can now easily troubleshoot and fix disabled Christmas lights.
2,"Dangerous Journey - Entertaining, But Flawed","I am amazed that none of the other reviews caught at least one major flaw and perhaps there will be more. Simple, Sloth and Presumption are out of correct order in that The Dangerous Journey has them before the Interpreters House and before the burden is off Christian's back. John Bunyan's classic has these three characters placed after the Cross. It is important to stay true to the text because it is a Classic. This makes me wonder if the reviewers before me, have ever read the original. Such is the times in which we live. PS: The Video makes the same error."
3,Good Introduction for Children,"My children loved this book when they were younger, around 6 and 8, I think. While some of the finer points may have been lost on them, they understood the main idea, and liked to sit with the book when we finished to study the illustrations. I've seen them each pull it off the shelf and read it through on their own now and then. My son, 12, is going to read the Bunyan's unabridged version this semester, and he's skimmed through it and so far is not balking at the challenging style, perhaps because of his early exposure to it through this version."
2,Pictures too scary for young kids.,"I'm a big Pilgrim's progress fan, and was hoping to find an illustrated book to share it with my son. This one, however, has far too disturbing images. The giant, appolyon, and other characters are depicted in a way that I would not want to show my son, for fear that he would get nightmares."
2,Dangerous Journey: The Story of Pilgrim's Progress,"We gave this book to our five-year-old grandson for Christmas. His mom is reading it to him each night and they both love it! The stories are so well-written for children that they can remember and apply it to their daily lives. While the family was out for a walk last week, our grandson was meandering through a ditch beside the road. He piped up with this comment,""Mommy, I'm wandering in the slough of despond."""
2,Pretty awful,"I have about an intermediate level understanding of Arabic. I bought this little dictionary because I sometimes can't think of the word I need or because I can't remember how its written. So the plusses are that it's portable and has the written arabic script next to the words. I was very surprised, however, and disappointed, to find that many very simple words were not even included. Imra'a, for example (woman) was not listed on the Arabic side. Walad (boy) was not listed at all. Some of the translations were not as I learned them, so I am hesitant to look up new words for fear that I will memorize them incorrectly. I did want something light, but I wanted it light in weight, not content."
3,Fair value,"Price is right. But they are a little thin - tear more easily. I do not think they will stand up to the pressure of everyday wear and riding. However, they are easier to get on than some of the others. Time will tell."
3,Purchased for my 2 sons.....,I guess its what you can expect for a silver thin made bracelet lasted about a week and fell to pieces. But it was pretty worn for the little time they lasted.
3,a review of THE REVOLT OF THE ELITES,"This is a rather disappointing work. It was the last work written by Christopher Lasch. Similar to earlier works it is a broad criticism of modern society. Written as he was approaching death, it expresses a disenchantment with America during the ""Clinton"" years. Unlike earlier works it contains sympathy with those who have religious beliefs. In my opinion, this book is not as clearly written as some of his earlier works. The book does not really have a cohesive message. Perhaps the main thesis of the book has to do with the book's title. The title refers to the argument that those who are running our society are disconnected from the ideals of the majority. Yet, Mr Lasch also asks the question whether democracy deserves to survive."
1,Who Moved My Frog?,"Oh, my. Everyone here raves about ""what a great idea this is"", ""reminds me of..."", ""just like"", ""similar to ....""Yeah, well that's the trouble. It IS similar to....And this ""Ping the Frog"" is no traditional fairy tale character which make ME think it was the product of some WISEGUY, sitting around thinking, ""H-m-m-m-, how can I write one of those crappy, throw-away mis-management books, without an original thought in MY head, and still make a bundle? I know! I'll STEAL really good concept, and then produce not one, but TWO books, and then try to spin off some marketing on the merchandising!Isn't America great?""Folks, boycott bad writing and thievery. Re-read ""Who Moved My Cheese""."
1,Leather Case,The leather case is just too small for the palm. It fits too tight and the bottom slightly covers up bottom of the screen.
2,Worth $4.95 not $14.95,"This four-page laminated card is worth no more than five dollars. It is basically a four pages of laminated notes, like you see for $3.95 in any book store. This product is ridiculously over-priced."
2,Just the Basics,"I wasn't very impressed with this product and, quite frankly, can find the same information online for free. I would suggest anybody interested in screenplay formatting to look for a good book on the subject because this product lacks the details that you will need."
1,Not worth the money,"This is not a book; it's a laminated card (four sides) containing the most basic of screenplay formatting information. At a cost of over $18 including P&P, it is not worth the money. Beginning and even advanced screenwriters should instead purchase David Trottier's, ""The Screenwriter's Bible"" (4th edition). Now THAT is a useful resource."
1,horrible! can't replace parts!,"ls-9875lite-sourceDon't buy lamps from this company. If any part breaks, they won't replace it. They claim that their distributors will replace it, but when you call the distributors, the distributors have the same porblem ""lite-source won't give us parts""Lite Source LS-9875MULTI Calypso 5-Light Floor Lamp with Multi-Crackled Glass Shades, Polished Steel"
2,"Requires very expensive, hard to find bulbs","I have owned this lamp for 3 years and still love the way it looks. BUT, it takes a ridiculously expensive and hard to find bulb($13.91 ea here on Amazon40Watt 120Volt E12 B Type Incandescent Bulb) You cannot use a standard ""candelabra"" type bub. It sticks way out past the shade. We have tried other substitutions but none of them work out right. BOO."
1,overpriced,"You can buy essentially this same lamp at Home Depot and Target for $20. The only difference is that in those lamps the shades are plastic and not glass. IMHO, it's not worth the difference."
3,"Love Doug, not impressed with Amazon Instant Video","Doug is such a great show, and I was so excited to have access to all four seasons! I was prepared to buy them all, but I am finding Amazon Instant Video to be pretty disappointing. The video quality is POOR, even when it's not in full screen (!!), and you can't actually download any of your purchases unless you have a Kindle. I find that to be false advertising, it should be stated more clearly to what machines you can download these videos.All that said, this is the only place online that you can find these shows, and I am thankful that Amazon has them, but I won't be purchasing the other seasons after all, not until some changes come around.Doug the show: 5 stars.Amazon Instant Video: 2 stars."
2,awesome if it worked right,"I ordered this for my fiance's birthday since it was one of his favorite childhood shows. First, it took over a month to arrive at my house (I had to renew the order so it wouldn't just automatically refund me for taking so long). Then we discovered that it didn't work on 3 out of the 4 dvd players in my house. I returned it hoping it was just a bad set, but it wasn't. The new one we got worked exactly the same. So we can only watch it in one room in our house, and hope that if we want to watch it at someone else's house that it works right. Buying it would be a gamble for whether or not it'll work in your personal dvd player."
5,"Doug, my friend, it's been too long.","There are two ways to see Doug episodes. One is to buy them from iTunes. The other is to buy them from Amazon (or from someone who bought them from Amazon). I don't see these episodes getting an official release with all the bells and whistles, so for that reason this burn-on-demand set is the way to go. If you enjoyed Doug back in the day and want to enjoy him again, buy this set."
5,Doug ROCKS!,doug is a great show for all ages especially for teenagers who love to remember they're past. i love this show the only thing that didn't work out to well for me was its on DVR! it may not work on all of your household dvd players. Luckily i have 2 that do play it so i can watch it upstairs and downstairs!
1,Poor Product of a Great Show,"Finally Doug on DVD, Yeahhh!!!. BUT! When I put the first disc in the DVD player, the picture quality looks as bad or worse as some of my old vhs tapes. Picture shaking on the menu screen was my first clue this product was not as good as I was expecting. Then I find out one of my 3 discs will not play, aaauggghhhh!!! Hopefully the replacement will work better, but the same company also made the Hey Arnold Discs which I got in this same order, of which, 2 of the 4 disc set also will not play. My fingers are crossed, GET IT RIGHT!!!! Please!!!!"
2,"Doug good, quality bad",I was watching them and they were going good until I got the the 3rd disc and it would not play. So I didn't get to watch any on the 3rd disc. Kind of not happy about that.
5,Doug Season 1,This is a good Doug Season Collection. It has all the episodes from season one. They look and sound good. I grew up watching this show and it isn't just for kids! If you like the show Doug Make sure you buy this high quality three disc collection.
4,Doug: Season 1 review,"Has all the episodes from season one (including the pilot episode). Video quality is just as I remembered it when I first watched the show on Nickelodeon (I don't know whether that's bad or good though). Simple menus, yes, but it does get the job done as far as navigating through the episodes. All in all, a great buy."
4,Where is the Squeaker?,"I love this book. It has been a favorite of mine for years. I was happy to rediscover this edition and couldn't wait to share it with my children. It is a very sweet story of a little bear whose squeaker will not squeak.My one complaint is that the previous edition *SPOILER ALERT* had an actual squeaker built in so you could actually push Threadbear's tummy and hear it squeak for the ""first"" time. I'm not big on books with gimmicks but this gimmick actually had a context to the story.Sadly there is no real squeaker at the end of this story. Hmph!The CD is very well done though. My son brought it to school for show and tell and the whole class enjoyed it.This is a wonderful story."
4,Good,"This is a good collection of 1980s music at its best but they made a track mistake Paula Abdul doesn't sing ""Oh Sheila"" she just sings ""Straight Up"" but oh well. This is a good collection a must buy."
4,Good,"It was for my sister, since she already used it in the past and asked for it, I am sure she liked it."
4,"Great Covers, Great Vocals, Great Fun","This, the second to last release by this underrated band, has the boys groovin' and playing their way through a fine list of covers, from ""Stagger Lee"" to Otis Redding's ""That's How Strong My Love Is"" to the traditional ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken.""The vocals and harmonies are as strong as ever, and the band turns in a few tremendous originals, including the closer ""Light Shine,"" which is a nice bookend to their early hit ""Get Together."" Their cover of ""Hand Jive"" is one of the better versions of this song. If you like good-time, hanging on the porch, traveling music, you are in the right place."
3,Typical amusing Wodehouse,"Not among his very best, but as always, P G. Wodehouse can make you chuckle as you read his amusing stories."
1,"Really sucky heater, only buy if you like being cold","The size is misleading. The actual heating element is not very big. There is a lot more casing than heat element to this product.My main problem is you have to be really, really close to the heater to feel warmer. Like 6 inches away or something.Also, do not get this heater to warm your feet. I know heat rises but if you stick this in front of you sitting down your feel will be as cold as if you didn't have it.I would not buy this again."
1,Fused the socket and cut off power for a few times.,"It fused a few sockets and left a burn mark behind. Returned after 1 week, dangerous heater. The base is not well made, it wobbles."
4,It's good,It's good. It dose what it's made for. If you can't sleep with noise then this is not for you.
5,Excellent product,Easy to put together. Tucks away into a corner nicely so it takes up very little room. Very easy to use and the remote is extremely handy. Relatively quiet (soft fan noise when on). Heats the room up fast and constantly monitors to maintain desired temperature. Highly recommended.
4,Just what the doctor ordered,"Here in Durango Colorado we not only have cold winters, we have old buildings. This means that many businesses and homes are ""after-wired""... creating issues with things like heating and cooling. In my office the temperture zones vary creating a cat and mouse game of turning the heat up and down when no one is looking :) To help alleviate this issue, I purchased one of these for our coldest culprit and it surely does the job. I needed something that was quiet and delivered the heat and I am happy to say this product is perfect. The timer is an extra bonus for a forgetful co-worker. The only issue I had with it was when I was putting it together. The base does not fit together perfectly and one side is more elevated than the other, creating a slight tilt. If it were not for that, I would have given it 5 stars. All in all, I would buy this again with no hesitation."
1,You would get more Heat from a Candle!,"I ordered this thing after seeing the good reviews on Amazon. The heater does everthing well except: heat. That's right. It's all digital, oscillates, has automatic shutoff when it reaches a certain temperature, etc. So I suppose very little money was left to actually create a decent heating element when all the bells and whistles were figured in.Honestly, one could get as much heat if they had a windproof candle and a fan. I had this on one night last week when it was in the forties outside, with the heater on in my house, and the heat would not move about 70.Also, if you look at the October Consumer Reports on space heaters, Lakso did very poorly--Honeywell, Kenwood, Soleus, Vornado and a few others all did better.If you are looking for bells and whistles this may be your heater. If you are looking for a heater that actually heats look elsewhere!"
3,A little disappointed,"I read the reviews for this heater and they were generally quite good. Since I had purchased two similar Lasko heaters about 7 years ago, and they were both great, I thought this one would be as well. The design was changed somewhat though. The pedistal platform on the older units were not roung, but had a rather flat, but rounded back. That design was much more stable than the new round base. So, I removed the base from one of my older heaters and put it on the new heater. That worked ok. I have to say that the older heaters seemed to produce more heat than this one, and the remote control seemed to be better as well. I will keep the new one, but I wish they hadn't changed the design of the older ones which was really better. I would recommend this new one, but with reservation due to the unstableness of the round base."
2,Too Hot!!!,"Heater front surface got too hot for safety, should not use around children, or pets.I returned the heater to Amazon."
5,Instant Heat,"Bought this for my dad to use as a back up for when his heat pump heater freezes. According to him it was easy to assemble and use. He turned it on and within moments it heats up. Loves the remote which controls the temperature, can also use it to set the timer so the unit can shut it self off. Great Item."
5,Works as Promised,"After reading all the reviews - both plus and minus, I ordered the heater with my fingers crossed. It was most easy to assemble, and works perfectly for what we wanted- heating a small room that stay rather cold. It heats the room quickly as well. I love the remote that comes with it. I have NO complaints! I would recommend this product"
3,Not the Best Heater I have seen,This heater to me is okay. I had a hard time putting the stand on to where it will not lean. I don't know if that is just a problem with this one or if all have that problem. The remote control is a nice feature but I don't really feel the heat coming out as much as I think it should. The unit is pretty quiet.
2,Only great if you stay close to the heather.,One thing though... if you're beyond 2 feet of it you won't feel nothing. My wife would give it only one star.Not much output.
3,adequate,"This space heater is not bad, but seems to take 20 minutes to get a medium sized room up to temperature. Actually, it only heats in a 8 foot radius. It's best quality is that it is very quiet."
4,Gets the job done,"I purchased this heater because my home/office can get a little chilly in the winter. It's approximately a 10'x9' room and this unit does a great job of warming it up and keeping it warm thanks to the auto thermostat setting.My only complaint is actually with the thermostat setting. It doesn't reliably measure the actual temperature in my office. I have a digital thermometer hanging up on the wall opposite where I keep this heater plugged in. If the heater is running and is set to keep my office at 72, I find that the heater turns off too soon because it thinks the temperature in my office is 72; but the thermostat on the wall says that my office is actually 68. So, I end up having to turn the heater up to 76 or 77 in order to have it warm my office actually to 72 degrees. This is a minor inconvenience, though, considering that the heater does a good job of keeping my office space toasty in the winter."
4,Ceramic heater,Great little heater. It is very easy to operate and light enough to move easily from room to room. It is slow in heating a medium size room but otherwise works as advertised. Love the electronic controls and quiet motor when operating.
4,"Not top of the line, but OK for the money.","These ARE NOT top grade faucets, but for the money they are OK.Look good, simple, classic style."
1,King Holiday info,"In answer to a music fan from Temple Hills, the song was called King Holiday by the King Dream Chorus & Holiday Crew. It came out on Mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned. It made no.30 on the R&B Charts but didn't crossover pop. The lyrics are on the net (try Google) but I don't know if the song still is."
4,Perfect accessory if you know a Honda,"I am not extremely hands on when it comes to fixing automobiles, but I do know my way around a garage. This book goes step by step at describing how to perform the operations they mention. There are a few spots where you need to look up some additional information. It is a must have for anyone who owns one of these bikes and wants to get their hands dirty or even just save some cash at the dealer. I gave 4 stars because I feel like some of the information could be described a little better, but then the book would be twice the size!"
5,HONDA SHADOW 750,"Item being reviewedHaynes Honda Shadow VT600 & 750 Owners Workshop Manual: 1988 thru 2003THIS MANUAL IS GOING TO HELP ME MORE THAN YA ALL KNOW.IT IS GOING TO BE AN EXPERANCE AND THEN SOME. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MOTORCYCLE,I HAVE A FRIEND TEACHING ME AS I GO..BUT I KNOW THIS MANUAL WILL BE A GODSEND!!!.IT HAS LOTS OF DETAIL.. WISH ME LUCK."
4,Equal vs splenda,I use equal and splenda. Equal less expensive and good for non-cooking.Splenda better for cookng.One packet of equal sweeter than one packet of splenda.
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I've had mostly good experiences with books from this OUP series. This one was somewhat disappointing because, for such a brief book the author spends too much space on his own views and too little on information about prehistory, which is what he was supposed to do."
5,My Favorite Non-Fiction,"In the first volume, Frame beautifully describes her New Zealand childhood. Her descriptions of her family, their day-to-day lives, and their economic and personal hardships, stay with the reader long after reading Volume I.In Volume II she describes her college years and subsequent mental mis-diagnosis, which led to several years of institutionalization. Rather than leaving the reader depressed, somehow she brings one into the experience but leaves us wondering at her resilience and ability to continue writing.Volume III contains her account of her growing acceptance as a writer and her association with other well-known New Zealand writers. This is a must for anyone interested in: a brilliant picture of an artist; New Zealand life; good non-fiction writing."
5,Fading in and out with prerecorded media...,"I don't own a DVD recorder, but planning on buying one very soon.One reason the picture fading might be happening -- Is your recorder hooked up through your VCR? This activates Macrovision copy protection that is built in on virtually all commercial DVDs to prevent illegal copying to VHS tape. You must ALWAYS hook up DVD players either directy to the TV, or through a switchbox or A/V reciever. Make sure you use S-video, or Component cables for best picture. I can't tell you how many times I see people using regular video cables to hook up their DVD players. They never have a clue how much better the other options look, nor do they often realize their TVs had those inputs all along."
5,One often overlooked feature,"Several reviews discuss the reduction in quality in going from a 2 hour recording to a four hour recording. One very cool feature on this machine is Flexible Recording, where it will set the recording time and quality to exactly the time you need.So if you need to record a movie that's 2 hours and 10 minutes, insead of using the 4 hour setting and having the large reduction in quality just to fit in the extra 10 minutes, use Flexible Record mode, set it for 2 hrs 10 mins, and get almost the same quality as the 2 hour mode.This feature makes a huge difference in the recording quality of the many movies that run just over 2 hours."
5,Panasonic DVD recorder.,"I have 6 of these DVD recorders. It is so user friendly. Panasonic sent me a disc update to increase the speed of the drive to 8X. No one was selling the 4X discs anymore. I was in a total panic. I tried a Toshiba DVD recorder and it took a rocket scientist to figure it out and I still had major problems. Needless to say, I returned it. I highly recommed a Panasonic."
4,Secret Knowledge Here,"This a great introduction to cults around the world who practice the Magick of the Left Hand Path. It shows that such practices spring up spontaneously, and therefore are somehow deeply imbedded in our consciousness, destined to spring up from time-to-time and place-to-place."
5,Warmly Inspiring +++,"I have found ""Flaming Door"" by Eleanor Merry to be warmly inspiring. The full original name of this work is ""Flaming Door (1936)"". For me, it is quite interesting [and amusing] that this is a pre World War Two work. Alot of her ideas seem much like far later ""Celtic"", ""Druidic"" and ""New Ager"" ideas. She does base alot of her work on traditional and historical ""Celtic"" matter. Yet, quite alot is creative extentions from that. In particular, her linkages [fairly often] to ""Atlantis"" will likely annoy some and please others. Some, like I, will find that ""okay"" from still having an open mind in that area. All-in-all an interesting and inspiring work to complement ""cooler"" works on ""Celtic"" and ""Celtic Christian"" topics -- such as ""The Grail Legend"" by Emma Jung."
4,Travel Yatzee,I mentor and I needed something easy to transport. This fills the bill nicely. It comes with a zippered case and all contents are inside.
4,"Yahtzee, a little too large for travel","This is a nice set. However, the zip case that comes with it makes the set too large to travel with it. I took the pieces out of the case and used a ziplock bag to pack for travel."
1,useless,"as other reviewers have noted, the author seems to have some very real conflicts with being a sexual human being. that seems reasonable enough, human sexuality is full of conflicts, but people expecting this book to help resolve theirs will be disappointed. it's like the author of some 1950s hygiene manual woke up, read a couple of pop-metaphysics books and spit this little tome out in a coffee-binge weekend. the author equates thinking about someone while masturbating to raping them. (to my 8th grade girlfriend, i apologize, i swear i had no idea!) he also displays a fascinating preoccupation with the acroynms D.I.C.K. and A.S.S. hmm, curious. . ."
5,My favorite cream!,This cream is so wonderfully made - it does not feel too commercial at all. Pure extract rose essential oil fragrance and slightly thick to combat even the driest skin - it gives you an amazing glow!!
5,A good work book on screenwritting,"You'll learn everything you need to learn about screenwriting including defining the idea on which your script is built, creating the model the paradigm that professionals use, bringing your characters to life write dialouge like a pro, and structuring your screenplay for success from the first pages to the final act."
3,Useful for Beginner Me,"Field's how-to books were recommended to me by another screenwriter and this one seemed to have diagrams and new info. My weakness was on structure. Field gives a pretty formulaic structure with numbers which is working for me right now. It did help me to know where to place scenes and events.It would have been helpful to have options other than the standard three-act explored or at least mentioned.If you are looking for structure knowledge, read it but I wouldn't be limited by it."
2,Repetitive,"This book is repetitive, that is to say that it repeats itself, it says things that it has said before, things that it has said in the past, that is to say, things that it has said earlier, whether it be an earlier sentence, paragraph, or chapter.Does the above sentence drive you crazy? Well, get used to it! This book has some good ideas and helpful hints and I won't say it's not worth reading. However, Syd must have been paid by the word, because he says the same thing 3 or 4 ways in the same sentence. Occasionally he does this in a way that clarifies what he said the first time, but usually it seems like he's trying to show off how many synonyms he knows.I've never read any of his screenplays, so I'm not sure what kind of screen writer he is, but as a book writer he makes it feel like an effort to get through the many words and to the actual substance. Very frustrating!"
5,A Star Is Born,"I bought it, used it and now I'm a Hollywood screenwriter. If you follow the workbook you will have a feature-length screenplay. Whether or not it's any good, well that's another story."
3,Screenwriters Workbook,I haven't read the entire book yet........ seems to duplicate what other titles I have on hand
4,spectator bird,"Wallace Stegner is a master of words. I was going to re-read Angle of Repose and decided to read other novels of his. This is beautifully written, showing the sweet, bitter, intricate aspects of growing old and maintaining relationships. I still want Angle of Repose."
3,Something of a failure.,"This book has an interesting construction. A happily married couple is living out a very comfortable, uneventful retirement. Occasioned by a postcard from a woman they met on an extended trip to Denmark, they re-read the husband's diary of the trip. He had been tempted by the Danish woman, who is the heroine of what can only be described as a Gothic tale, one the couple briefly became involved in. As you might expect from Stegner, much of the writing is good, although there is one scene (midnight on the lake), when the similes come so fast, it is almost a parody. The Gothic tale is engrossing. Yet, for me the novel was something of a failure. As a senior citizen I can appreciate the validity of Stegner's portrayal of the challenges and rewards of retirement and a good marriage, but I found the portrayal lifeless for the most part."
4,Are Americans Afraid of Scandinavian Society?,Wallace Stegner brought back vivid memories of my seven month stay in southern Sweden. His images of the physical landscape were wonderful and true. His story of managed human breeding makes me query whether Americans have trouble accepting a society that has both an aristocracy but also values social equity for most of the population. Did Stegner find it necessary to criticize Denmark by manufacturing a human experiment because he had trouble accepting a society that was far more equalitarian than the American society?
4,Stegner hits all his concerns here,"Stegner has three narrative concerns, and the SB hits them all. There is Stegner's nearly vice grip hatred of the counter culture. There is the fascination with the decay of the old, and finally, an interest in eugenics, here expressed in a Danish noble and his son who attempt to inbreed with their servants to create a vibrant strain of humans. Overall, SB, like most of Stegner's work, gives a neat view of what a writer can do when he or she tenaciously latches onto a theme, and exploits it to great effect, adding nuance each time. I think Stegner does that here, and that is what prevents SB from being merely a repetition."
2,Obnoxious lead character,"They guy moves from NYC to the area east of san Francisco and then whines about the software people buying the land near him and building big houses. It's like ""I was here first"". He even complains about getting his beret soaked with rain. He's exectly like the people who are ruining Montana and Wyoming"
1,Skip this unless...,"If you like Gothic tales, novels like Embers, then this is for you! So much heavy breathing, foreshadowing, dark hints, pregnant pauses (literally), and unlikely plot twists played out against moonlit nights and witchesdancing in the woods, while a thoroughly ""modern"" aging narrator looks back to tell this tale--returning to his diary of a passionate encounter one night 20 years ago in his middle years when he glimpsed the possibility of life (and love) beyond the ordinary...and of course let it go. Quite wisely! Not since ""Rebecca"" has a work of popular fiction so irritated me, but if Sir Olivier comes back from the dead to play the hero, I'm game."
3,"Doesn't measure up to Angle of Repose, but still worthwhile","I loved Angle of Repose so was looking forward to The Spectator Bird, but I'm not as enthusiastic as the other reviewers. I had a hard time getting interested in the characters or the story. I liked the narrator's reading of the journal as a story device, but found the actual situation in Denmark to be less interesting, less shocking than I'd imagined it to be. The book is worth reading, but I'd have trouble recommending it to friends as enthusiastically as I did Angle of Repose."
5,"I laughed, I wondered","I read Crossing to Safety so long ago, I can't remember which I liked more. The relationships of this book's lead character are so real and so well described/complex (subtley so) that you may find yourself sharing the lead character's views of them. As a 30 something reader, it was a bit humbling and an excuse for ruminating about what my life and choices have been compared to Stegner's Joe Alston. Lost opportunities, love, sorrow, joy, new frontiers, redemption and more. This book has it all."
2,Will make you feel old,"I liked Stegner's ""Angle of Repose"", but this book just seemed to be too depressing. The main character keeps reminding the reader of his body falling apart and the ravages old age inflicts upon us, sooner or later, if we live long enough.The story that takes place in the main character's past, as he recalls it, is interesting and filled with splendid descriptions and illustrations, for which Stegner is indeed a master. But the downer, for me anyway, is the continual return to ""present day life"" of the main character, his negativity, and grim outlook on life.Not enough optimism in this book for me, nor enough deep sorrow to provide a moving experience. I didn't feel like it delivered. Sorry. :("
4,NcStar AR15 scope 3-9X42E,"This scope is everything I was looking for. It is compact, easily mounted and removed, features zoom (3-9X), allows use of iron sights while on rifle, performs near excellent(couldn't always be exactly on the ""x"" probably due to my limited abilities), appears to be sturdy and resistant to rough handling such as dropping and falling(although I only had this for a short time), and most of all, not prohibitively expensive. The relatively low cost allows me to be at ease when handling this item, otherwise I would constantly be trying to protect it and ""baby"" it. If it should ever get damaged, I would not hesitate to replace it with an identical item."
2,Good Scope - Bad Mount,"This is a pretty good scope, but the mount would not fit the handle on my Stag AR. It wasn't even close."
4,decent product,Corkscrew works but I hope it lasts - the plastic components seem to be a little weak for the job.
1,Maybe I'm doing something wrong but...,"... I don't find the sharpener to do that great a job. I have used Lansky sharpeners for years and recently acquired a Chef's Choice 120. Here are my impressions:PROS:- Does an OK job for the person with no sharpening skills whatsoever.CONS:- You have to get the timing just right when drawing knives through the unit, otherwise the grind is uneven.- If you accidentally allow the point of the knife to dip down upon withdrawing, it will excessively grind the tip.- The rubber feet do not do an adequate job of stabilizing the unit. It will creep when it is in use. I had to place mine on a piece of latex drawer liner.- Finally, and this is what I dislike most of all - it leaves longitudinal scratches along the length of the knife. The scratches are not deep but they ARE noticeable.My advice - Get a sharpening stone and learn to use it or if you don't feel comfortable with establishing sharpening angles, get a Lansky or Gatco sharpener. Stay away from this unit."
5,The perfect sharpener - count on it.,"If you have invested in a good set of knives - do yourself a very big favor and invest in a quality knife sharpener. I wish I had purchased this months ago - it is a bit expensive but worth every penny. Don't mess with manual sharperners - to many chances for a mistake that can ruin a quality knife. One thing to mention if you buy this - READ THE MANUAL - that's a must. There are different wheels (for sharpening) based on how you will use your knives - if you read the manual and do exactly what it says, you can't go wrong."
5,Chefs Choce 120,arrived on time. It functions very well. Sharpened knives that were really dull and re-sharpened knives that had lost their fine edge.
5,Very nice,I choose 5 stars because this is a very nice sharpener and the price was great. Arrived in time for Christmas. Our son loved it.
5,Works on really dull knives,"I purchased this knife sharpener to use on my set of Wuesthoff knifes. My knives were beyond dull and in really poor shape. I bought this hoping the three stages would be capable of sharpening even my dullest knife. I have to say it worked wonderfully! I followed the instructions exactly and it was easy to sharpen all my knives. I love that it was easy to use, sharpened my knives well, and will also be cheaper than taking my knives to be professionally sharpened!"
5,Chef's Choice,Gift for my husband. We now have the sharpest knives in town. This is a great machine. Quick and easy to use.
4,Pretty good,"I bought this product to replace an older version, the 100.The 100 was very tedious to use and took dozens of passes and a lot of practice to get a decent edge. The 120 works much better. I tried it with some old and dull Henkels, and with a lot fewer passes at each station and better directions, I got better results - though not what I would call scary sharp. I save 5 stars for scary sharp."
4,"A solid, solid sharpener","The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is that, at the end of the day, it's still over $120 (at least when I purchased it) for a knife sharpener. The quality of the item, so far, has been great. I have no complaints, the ease of use is there, and what little instructions you need are very clear. If money is not an object for you, you can pretty much call this a 5-star product."
2,not as advertised,"Doesn't give the razor sharp edge of a manual ceramic hone. I was looking for a automatic way to sharpen knives, but went back to the manual hone."
5,Chef's Choice 120 3-Stage Diamond Hone Professional Sharpener,This is a great product - Wish I would have purchased it sooner. Does a super job of sharpening and is simple to operate.
3,Chefs Choice 120 over rated...,"I purchase this electric sharpener after reading lots and lots of rave reviews. It's not that great, If you knives are dull ,you want to make them sharper than they were ,and you have no idea how to use a honing stone or steel; then you'll like this product. If you like a SHARP!!!knife this is not your answer."
5,CuttingEdgeOutcome,"Machine is easy to use and works very well. It is quiet; instructions are clearly written.My wife and I have both cut ourselves on recently sharpened knives!!! BTW, we had NEVER sharpened our knives before. Some are 35 years old!!!"
3,"If you dont know what sharp really is, this is great","This isnt a bad sharpener. For the average person who's drawer full of knives have never been sharpened it will seem like it performs miracles. But for those of us who know what a sharp knife is, this will not get you there."
2,A lot of hype,"I bought this hoping to avoid the boring job of sharpening my Henckels. I can do a good job with my stones, but I cannot shave with the knives. I hoped the Chef's Choice would do a better job better than I could do by hand. I read the instructions with great care and sharpened with equal diligence. I do not see how I could improve my technique. The Chef's Choice is not even close to what I could do by hand and I do not think my hand sharpening is that great. This machine may be OK for the rankest of beginners, but not if you want a truly sharp edge. Save your money. Get some good hones and put up with the chore."
2,disappointing results,I expected to be able to use this sharpener to get a very good sharp edge to a knife. Unfortunately the edge I have been able to get is marginal at best. I've found that to get a truly sharp edge I have to use a hand stone and steel. I've been quite disappointed in the results.
2,Scratched knife unnecessarily,"I purchased this item based on the recommendation in Cook's Illustrated, and although it did sort of sharpen the blade, it also scratched the knife unevenly roughly 3/4"" above the blade edge. In my case, this means I now have a cosmetically damaged -- albeit slightly sharper -- very expensive Wusthoff knife.And I will note that this is after extremely careful reading and following of the directions -- specifically because I wanted to avoid any damage to the knife.Yes, the knife is slightly sharper, but it's now ugly. Not a huge deal, but either my specific sharpener is defective, or this is a flawed product. Either way, don't risk it if you value your knives cosmetically."
2,Didn't like it.. Returned it,Might be good for already sharp knives. I have good Chicago knives but they were getting very dull. I tried four knives and it barely sharpened them. Not worth the money to me.
5,Great product,Bought this for a gift for the recent holidays and my husband just loves sharpening the knives. He always wants to show them off to me to see what a beautiful edge this machine puts on the knife. It is the gift he enjoys the most!
5,Added benefit,There are other knife sharpeners available and perhaps some as good as this one however this is the one I bought and quite simply it works. Now owning this machine has an added benefit in addition to having sharp knives which are a pleasure to use and that is you can dispense with all those very expensive knives and knife sets. How long a knife holds its edge is no longer important as it is so simple and quick and convenient to bring it up to the highest standard. Yes you can dispense with the need for those outrageously expensive knives and purchase commercial knives from a commercial supply store as Sam's. They come sharp and with this machine they stay sharp and to make everything absolutely perfect just buy in addition a pull through knife sharpener for the top of your counter. Your inexpensive knife may not need it but with the conveninece at hand a quick pull through assures a razor sharp edge and a smile on ones face. Thank you.
4,120 chefs sharpner,"work very well on swiss army knifes super sharp, also very good on filet knifes. seems to do the best job on thin blades. will sharpin fatter blades like my bowie knifes but better (sharper) on thin blades.."
5,You cannot go wrong,I had no idea how a sharp knife makes a huge difference in cooking. I was ready to throw out a very expensive knife set. This machine is unbelievable...cooking is an art again after using this. THe best gift I have ever received. I plan on buying this for a bunch of people for these holidays!!!!
5,Sharp knives at last!!,"A relatively easy way to sharpen knives. I purchased this specifically for hunting knives, but my wife uses it often in the kitchen. It takes a little finesse to do serrated knives, but it will work well with practice."
5,Excellent Sharpener,Very easy to use and puts a very fine edge on our knives. It is also very highly rated by a number of cooking sites and chefs. Think of it as a long term investment that will easily pay itself off in a short amount of time because of it's ability to quickly and safely provide a sharp edge on all your knives.
5,Very nice for use at home.,"Above all else read the directions & make sure your knives are clean before you sharpen them. This machine is fast, easy, & can put a variety of different edges on a blade. Although it's very simple to use, you need to read the directions to get the most out of it. I work in high volume carving stations and use the Chef's Choice 3-Stage after work every night to resurface the edges of my Henckels 5-star 10"" Granton Roast Slicer & 5-star 5 1/2"" Boning knife, then use a Henckels 12"" diamond steel to keep them trued up throughout the night. Each set of disks are at different angles & courseness and consistantly put a quality edge on a blade. I get better, more consistant results w/this machine than by using a diamond stone by hand, & it's a helluva lot faster & easier. It's very efficent as well as it only removes as much metal as necisarry as long as you follow the directions. It even works on clevers. For home use it's the best sharpener I've found so far."
4,Fantastic,This is an excellent knife sharper. It arrived packaged well. It is heavy and makes the sound of a industrial machine when powered up. I immediately sharpenedd all the knives in my kitchen. This sharpener will sharpen knives very easily and quickly. However it does not remove a lot of metal. So I think I will be reusing it very often to keep knives razor sharp. I recommend reading the manual and learning the proper way to use this tool. Recommended.
5,Chef's Choce lives up to advertisement,My kitchen knives have been dull to the point that when cutting meat the knife would tare the meat. Now the knives cut the meat. This is wonderful.
5,This knife sharpener was everything I was hoping for,"Our knives had not been professionally sharpened for years and we kept postponing doing anything about it, wondering who we could go to for sharpening services. I've done the first time treatment for all of them and now am using the sharpener to keep them sharp and it is such a pleasure to use my knives again!"
5,Excellent,"I've had our 120 for over a year now and couldn't be more pleased. I can't imagine having a sharper edge on our knives -- as it is, we warn our house guests about the sharpness if they'll be doing anything in the kitchen."
5,Excellent Knife Sharpener,"This knife sharpener is easy to use after you get the hang of it. The directions are not detailed enough for a novice like me to read, especially since I have a slight phobia about following directions correctly! I'm glad I bought the best knife sharpener I could afford. Highly recommended for beginners as well as accomplished cooks. We eat a lot of fresh veggies and salads, and I got tired of dull knives cutting me. Glad I bought this!"
5,This is the ONE!,"I have tried many different devices, this is the best ever. Yes it is expensive but if you want an easy way to make your knives razor sharp this is the device.I have had mine for going on 6 years, it has worked flawlessly and still sharpens my knives perfectly. In fact it may be cheaper now than it was 6 years ago!BUY IT!"
5,Our daughter is very pleased with her red knife sharpener.,"We bought a white knife sharpener and decided that since we were so happy with ours, we'd purchase a red one (requested color) for our daughter. She was just as happy with this one we purchased for her, as we have been with ours. This is an excellent product."
2,bad purchase,"I tried it on a Chicago Cuttlery knife and the only thing I noticed was that it took some metal off, but it wasn't sharp."
5,This is a great product,"I have used this product several times and it works so well that others in my family borrow it to sharpen their knives at home. I have some of the old knives (from mother and grandmother) that I had put out of service for many years because they would loos their edge fast. I loved the knives, but having to resharpen them every week on a stone got to be more trouble that it was worth. Now just a quick swipe and they are ready to go."
5,Sharpens the toughest,I've sharpened everything. I'm not sure what one reviewer was doing wrong that they couldn't sharpen very dull knives. I took out my Grandfather's hunting knife that has been in the shed for 50 years and used as a tool for everything. It had the edge of a butter knife. It only took me a few minutes to get it sharp enough the shave with. I've had this sharpener for two years and I'm back to buy another for my mother-in-law. And I like my mother-in-law! I've sharpened many of my friends knives too. I couldn't be happier.
2,Not for hunting type knives,Works okay for pocket knives and most kitchen knives. Thin blades are best. It works very POORLY on full size hunting knives. They won't fit in the guides. The 120 will not work on a Ka-Bar knife at all. The 120 works as advertised on thin blade knives. If you buy it READ ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST or you will be sorry.As for sharp .... well that is relative I guess. Most people would say this 120 will make a knife sharp. Not Razor sharp like I am a custom to when I use a stone.
1,The sharpener that can't!,"This was my second attempt at trusting a chef's choice knife sharpener and was my second time being completely disappointed. This sharpener does ""ok"" on kitchen knives. Not great but ok. But it claims to be able to sharpen hunting knives and other outdoor type of knives and it does not!!! It can only handle knives with a thin blade that has flat sides to it. Thicker blades or any blade that's not a full flat grind will not sit properly in the guides. Save your self the trouble of having to return this product and buy the KnifeMaster Pro Sharpening System. Not only can you do ANY knife, but you can also sharpen anything that needs sharpening like chisels, lawn mower blades and so on. As far as kitchen knives go, any pull through sharpener will give you a nice cutting knife for the kitchen for around 20 bucks. Buy yourself something nice with the one hundred dollars your save."
4,SDG,I bought one for myself several years ago and have loved it. My parents also liked it so I bought one for them this year for Christmas. It broke on the first use. They have sent it back to be fixed under warranty ~ do not know yet if it will be with or without complications. Hopefully the manufacturer will fix it without any problems. . .
5,Works great!,"The instructions for this are easy to follow and understand and it was really easy to use. Most of our knives were easily sharpened using just the 2nd and 3rd slots. It is fast and easy and the knives come out very sharp, like new again. I highly recommend this machine."
5,Second one purchased,I have one of these for myself and liked it so much I bought it for a friend to use at the hunting cabin so we always have sharp knives for our use. The best part is you don't have to know anything about sharpening knives to use this.
4,A very useful tool,"This sharpener does an excellent job on a wide variety of knives. For mine - which may have been extra dull - the first sharpening took more passes in the first two slots than the directions suggested. A second sharpening was much faster.My only complaint is that the instructions do not thoroughly describe or define the Asian knives for which it is inappropriate. I may have permanently ruined a couple that I quite liked, which are in an Asian style but made by European manufacturers,"
4,Knife sharpener,I picked this sharpener because it was hard finding someone in my area that handles knives.It works pretty good. Is easy to use
5,fantastic tool,Having useed this sharpner on most of my old knives I can safely say that you wont find a better sharpner. However I must admit to feeling a little cheated when I found the same tool at three local department stores for $40 less.
5,This is the one to buy,I purchased several models over a couple of weeks at the local stores till I finally bought this one online. This is the one to buy. The 3 sharpening wheels do a great job on even the toughest blades. I was able to change the angle on a titanium blade to the proper 20 degree cutting angle that the manufacturer choose to ignore. I really cuts welll now. Also I have been able to sharpen all of my S30v and 154cm steel tactical knives to perfect precision. Chef's Choice makes great products but the absolute best is the 120 model.Allen
4,It works okay...,"Our kitchen knives get used and abused. I finally started using a ceramic rod to sharpen them and as long as I kept them in shape, they have never been so sharp.That is a lot of work.My future son-in-law has this same model chef's choice sharpener so I made the jump and bought one. The knives do not get near as sharp as using the ceramic, but it saves me a lot of time. If you are a fanatic about razor sharp knives and actually know what a true knife edge should look like, you may not want this sharpener. But if you can accept a stone (diamond) grind finish with the resulting burr, you would be happy with this unit."
5,Excellent knife sharpner,"I bought this sharpner 6 months ago after reading good reviews about it, both here on Amazon and on Cook's Illustrated forum.The instrument is finely crafted and very easy to use. Knife sharpening is a breeze compared to the various and sundry old methods. It takes only a few minutes to sharpen all varieties and lenghts of knives, straight edges and the serrated kinds.Easy to clean. Keep it handy to sharpen an edge everytime before you use the knife!"
2,not real sharp,"My first electric knife sharpener....not really impressed. After trying to follow the directions exactly I am unable to get a sharp knife. It will take a blunt knife and help it out, but not what I call sharp."
5,Great knife sharpener,"I bought this sharpener after doing much research about electric knife sharpeners. I work in the butchering business so I needed something that would keep my knives sharp all day and it does just that. It says not to steel your knives but your gonna have to as long as you know how to do it, people at work are jealous of my knives now lol. Great product chefs choice!"
5,The best knife sharpener,"For the money, this is the best knife sharpener in the market place and is used not only by professional chefs but also by those of us that enjoy cooking and need a easy and effective way to really sharpen your knifes.I own this one and this was a gift to my son who is a game hunter and needed top grade sharpener.Don Rodrigues"
2,Cheap plastic,"I bought this product thinking it was a pratical way to open wine. It worked well on real cork, but not on the synthetic corks, also after using it less than 10 times it broke. The silver part that you hold at the top of the bottle broke, it is unrepairable. I am very disappointed in this item and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,a huge disappointment,"I am a huge fan of The Living End ever since I read about them in ""Car Kulture Deluxe Magazine."" So, it was no shock that, when I saw this album in the music store I bought it right away. But, when I actually listened to it I was disappointed. All but two or three of the songs even sound like the Living End that we are all accustomed to, a band that fuses punk, rockabilly, and jazz. This album is like listening to some warmed over 80's new wave. That's not the band that I love. I would recommend that if you like this group's previous albums at all stay away from this one all together"
4,"hey, this actually worked...hi mom!!","The Living End is a punk-pop band. i rate this CD a 4 outta 5. This Cd was awesome! The members are Chris Cheney, who sings and plays the guitar, Scott Owen, who also sings and plays the upright bass, and Andy Strachen who plays the drums. They've matured in this latest Cd and Chris has better writen songs. The song ""End of The World"", # 4, makes you think a little. It's about a dream of the end of the world coming.Also, # 6, ""Tabloid Magazine"" is a very real song.It's bout how mag. authors write lies and every1 believes em. It also tells how every1 believes all the gossip. I find their music very real and overall excellent! well, u should definetely buy this Cd!!! See ya...hey jay, mayara, cathy, maggy and philly(luck luck 4 u n your band comin soon, srry i 4got the name of your band...) peace! i ove u michael my mikey!!(yes ove!) so BUY IT NOW!!!"
3,Not their best.,"I've had this cd for a bit now and thought I should share my thoughts about it. I first saw this band open for Green Day at a theatre in Chicago. From then on I was hooked. Roll On is still one of my favorite cds I own. I was very excited when I got this cd, anticipating what catchy new songs would be on it. It was really a let down for me. There seemed something different about it to me. One of the main reasons I liked the first roll on so much was the vocals were so different of what we normally hear on the radio. The accents make the music sound I don't know, better. This cd was such a let down because the vocals sound more American. This cd sounds like it was made by another garage band from California. Don't get me wrong, it's still a decent cd, but it sounds just like every other new punk music you hear."
2,um?,"I thought the living end broke up because they hadn't released anything for about three years. I don't read many magazines or anything, so of course I wouldn't hear much from them otherwise. I loved their first two full length albums and I guess what you'd call a two-disk ep.. but then I heard their new album. As for their sound, I found it more immature than their previous albums. It seems they almost totally took out the rockabilly influence (with the acception of a couple songs) and their passion seems to have left the band as well. I'm not one of those people who hate bands that want to make a better living with their music, but it seems they tried to make this album more radio friendly in the sense that they're trying to hint to their audience that they want to sell out. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from hearing this, but if you liked their old stuff a lot, I'd recommend hearing sample clips of their new stuff or hear a friends copy before buying."
1,Terrible CD by a great band,This album is more like pop punk. I love every other release they have done. This album is nothing like any of their previous releases. It sounds like they are trying for a Nickelodeon teen choice award. Was this album produced by Blink 182? On the other hand if your into that kind of pop punk crap you may like this and not their other CDs. (added 10/04/04)I will leave my initial review intact but I have to add that after having this CD for quit some time it has really grown on me and has some killer tracks.

3,Foerster Product,"Happy with this particular item that I ordered, but I also ordered another item that I needed to exchange, but was unable to get in touch with the seller."
5,Best Wheel/Spoke Brush on Amazon,I was lucky to stumble upon this product and let me tell this product does not disappoint! It is well made and much larger than the images entail. It is about a foot tall and a few inches wide.
3,course brush,"I have a show classic car and this brush was a little rougher than I had wanted,but I found a nmew use for it."
4,Works Great!,Gets into inside of C6 Corvette wheels better than anything else I've tried. Does not seem to scratch. A little pricey. Recommend to fellow clean-car fanatics.
4,A Great Mix of Old-Time Music,"This CD contains a superb selection of old-time string music and vocals from an era that currently seems to be overlooked by the country-western crowd, and, to a certain extent,even the bluegrass affcionados. Some of the recordings in the mix are obviously dated and not the highest quality, but these are countered by crystal-clear performances by such greats as the New Lost City Ramblers, Mike Seeger, George Pegram, the Spare Change Boys, Mother Maybelle Carter and Doc Watson. This CD contains fiddle tunes, waltzes, cloggin' tunes, spirituals, instrumentals and vocals that are pure and totally acoustic. I love putting this CD in my truck, rolling down the windows, opening the moon roof, and cranking up the volume, drowning out the hip-hop coming from the hoopdies in the other lane. It's a fantastic selection."
3,Not Bad,"I hate those headphones that go inside the ear, so these looked promising. The sound quality is good, though I've had sets that had better bass than these. They are VERY comfortable; they don't squeeze the ear like some others that are worn the same way. The asymmetrical cord is annoying, but only if worn like regular headphones; people should remember that the cord for the right-hand side goes behind the neck. Not the very best headphones I've had, but not bad for the price, and certainly better than Apple's earbuds."
4,Good ones,They are very practical and easy to use. Very comfortable. I usually get irritation from earphones with prolonged use but not these ones.
5,Amazing Quality.,"Amazing, these headsets sound better then ipod headsets, though they are not as loud. The earpeice feels really comfortable, and the quality is better then an ipod headset, sony headsets, and various other headsets I tryed. The only problem that might make people mad is the right earpeice being longer then the other. Thats good for sharing music with other people though, so it all worked out fine.]\Finnally, the price is so cheap, for such good headsets, that it is amazing. I would recomend this tremendously."
4,Value for Money,The headphone is excellent since it is as compact as an earphone but comfortable like a headphone. I love this product and it is good value for money.
4,Good,These are good so far. I'm not terribly impressed with the bass compared to the old sony headphones I had before. These tend to be significantly quieter than the sony ones also. I am pleased overall.
3,Too much for shipping,"The product was what I wanted, but shipping was too much. It was the shipping for one item times 4 items I requested. I didn't realized that until I had press go on my computer otherwise I would have cancelled and purchased from someone else. I had one book item (large book) shipped for less.Not happy with shipping charges."
1,Lost,I cannot write a review of this item because unfortunately I have not receive it. As of November 20th the item is lost.
5,Perfect for Users with Hearing Aids,"I use Over the Ear Hearing Aids in both ears, so earbuds are not an option. These Panasonic Clip-On Headphones are the perfect solution for my needs. They weigh less than 3/4 ounce on each ear; the clips fit comfortably; the sound is excellent; and the price is right."
2,asymmetric NOT a good thing,"The sound quality of these headphones - great. But someone please explain to me why asymmetric cabling is a good thing. personally, i do NOT see the advantage of having one cord hang abt 4 inches from the earpiece while the other hangs about 12 inches from the earpiece. this makes no sense to me, yet other brands are touting this asymmetric system of theirs as something to be proud of. ""for more comfort"" they say, but how so??? all it does it make the cord hang weird and also cause extra weight to the short one, which then keeps struggling to stay hooked onto your ear. dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb"
3,Decent sound quality,"For a few years, I have used these comfortable headphones while exercising. Now, I found something even better - Maxfun clip-on headphones. Although the Panasonic ones are have decent sound quality, the Maxfuns are outstanding clarity of sound, even better than these Panasonic ones I've used!"
3,panasonic headphones sound leak,"The head phones have a lot of sound leak. It is as good as using speakers when listening on a high volume. So the people around will always know what you are listening to.If kept on a low volume, then there is no sound leak and they are pretty good. There is no crackling noise or anything."
1,What's up with the left ear's cord shorter than the right?,"I thought I received a manufacturing defect, until I read some of the reviews here at Amazon.com. The left cord is shorter than the right ear. Way shorter. It's four inches or so. The right ear's cord is about 12 inches. WTF!If I had known these headphones were of bizarre design, I would not have purchased them."
1,Do not stay in your ears,"The sound from these earphones was fine provided you could keep them in your ears. If you are planning to use these while doing anything more than walking, forget it. They will fall out of your ears."
2,incomodo de más!!!!,"Verdaderamente, falle al no darle credito a varias personas que hablaban sobre sus experiencias con este audifono. Primeramente, yo tampoco entendí el porque de la asimetria del cordon, lo cual lo hace muy incomodo tanto para el gimnasio como para correr, no lo recomiendo, la calidad del material no es buena y no se adapta tan bien al oido."
3,UMD with issues,Some of the UMDs of this title are not what they appear due to a manufacture error I would suggest getting this title used to ensure you actually get a copy with Hellsing on it and not some other Anime as it's not something you can know before you open it and pop it in your PSP and for the same reason a seller cannot prevent this in the case of a sealed copy....
2,I Got The Wrong Item,"I was so thrilled to find the fist three Hellsing episodes on a PSP UMD, me just buying one I was going cray trying to order things to watch and play on it. But when it got here, and I put it in, the anime that popped up was Gun Grave. (Which btw is a good anime, I watched the first two episodes for fun lol.)After emailing them, I planned to send back the UMD so they could send me another copy that was hopefully right, but I accidently deleted the email, and when I tried sending them another no one replied, so I'm stuck with it. My friend ordered the same thing, his was right though. So, you may or may not get what you want, remember that. =("
4,Okay,"We use in Florida for a un filiterd pond helps slow down the growth of algea to a point, but it is not meant to eliminate it."
3,may be good for large pond but not small birdbath,i bought this for an in-ground birdbath with a rock bottom. It did very little and the bath water was scummed over within a week.Birdbath Protector
2,quiet but ineffective,"Puts out a minimum amount of humidity. The water reservoir can only hold about half a gallon and slowly emits it over the course of 7-8 hours. You can barely even see the stream of water vapor. However, it is super quiet, save the occasional gurgle. The blue light is also super annoying and you can't turn it off at night. Would only work for an exceptionally small room."
1,Family Killer,"Purchased this unit on line but not from Amazon this review is not about amazon ....only the bionaire BWM5905-U,... filled it with water, plugged it in,...turned it on,....left the room to do some computer work,...smelled something,....lookin the room,..it had burst in to flames,...flames shooting up 2 feet,...threw a towel over it...threw it outside,....water was coming out the bottom,..flames out the top,...even if it had ran out of water,..which it did not,...it has a fail safe to shut off if empty....so no i would not buy this unit...my family almost died and have about 1000.00 dollars worth of damage to our home and still no humidifier. Alan007~!@"
1,Poor design; stopped working in 2 weeks,The valve at the bottom of the tank to supply water to the unit wouldn't work unless it was applied with LOTS of torque. It finally stopped working altogether in about 2 weeks. The cover lid was also a poor design. I expected much more.
1,don't buy this,"As the other reviewers said, do not buy this. I was suckered into it because I liked the features and the way the product looks. Unfortunately the product designers did not consider usability -- they designed the (allegedly germicidal) near-ultraviolet LED light to be close to the steam outlet, so that when you run the unit in a dark room, bright circles of blue light appear on the ceiling. And guess which frequencies of light signal our sleeping brain to wake up? That's right -- blue light. Stupid.It took 4 encounters with Bionaire customer service to ascertain that it is not possible for customers to disable this light.Plus, the unit stopped working after about 10 uses. Tried to find the owner's manual at the Bionaire website. Couldn't -- this product isnt' even on the Bionaire website.Don't buy it. I'm never buying from Bionaire again."
2,Well it lasted until 2009 ...,"Sadly, I must concur with the majority here... My Insignia lasted until late last year and then stopped playing any DVDs. I put it aside for a while and since I have 4 other DVD players, I let it sit. I tried it again in April, and amazingly it played for 2 months and then I started hearing whirring and grinding noises. I think that this is just a cheaply made unit that LG wouldn't even put it's name on. I have several other LG DVD players, one which has lasted over 5 years and another which is still playing very well for more than 3 years. I also have a 47"" LG LCD which is working well. I guess we have to stick with the brand names... Into the trash it goes, unless I can find a new DVD drive to place inside. The problems as has been stated before is finding a way to mount the drive as the original drive has a non-standard plastic case with splayed mounts."
1,"adequate for a while, then died","When first bought, it was easy to set up and record. I copied old VCR tapes to DVD and recorded shows to watch later (and skip commercials). The family did NOT like that it did not allow one to watch TV for up to several minutes when 1st turned on or when inserting a blank DVD. After one year it developed a progressive problem recognizing disks at times, both new and pre-recorded. This progressed over a short period of time -- now the DVD half is effectively dead. The VCR side works fine. I really expected it to last longer."
4,"Good, but not so good.",This watch is very complete and full of interesting and util functions. It helps a lot to have an accurate and more professional trainning. The problem is that I am not sure about the GPS' accuracy. Sometimes it shows inaccurate distance and speedy information.
4,Bodylink Bug?,Some users have reported problems with the system. A problem recording data that seems to relate to the GPS unit or the Data Recorder. See the Help Center Product Suport forum for Timex at hdosports online.
1,Funny,"I cried when I watched this, no really, I was laughing so hard that tears were streaming out of my eyes. This movie posed a great opportunity for my dad and I to have a nice late night father-daughter night. Dad and I bonded extremely well as we mocked the actors skills, or lack there of rather, and the lousy ""special"" effects. By the time the film ended and we realized no one was going to live, I was in hysterics and my dad was disgusted that we spent 80 minutes watching this messed up film.True, the plot might have gone somewhere had they hired actors based on (Le gasp) acting instead of their looks, Four kids, teens rather, kill a baby bear on a trip and ~BAM~ momma bear is out for revenge. I honestly wouldn't waste my money buying this, but that isn't to say it isn't worth watching for laughs. It might be a fun film to rent so you can mock it with friends. Anywho, if you buy, enjoy, if not, hope I was of help."
1,One of the WORST Horror Films EVER!!!,"Grizzly Rage sounds like a great set up for a good cheesy horror movie. I mean c'mon! Are bears that smart to know the person that kills their bear cub and exact that much revenge The acting was very subpar and there were no bear maulings, just a bunch of throwing at trees and roofs. This was like a cable access movie, only it was made by the ScyFy (formerly SciFi) Network along with some Canadian film company. This film company should have their license revolked for such a piece of crap. You'll be saying, ""I want 90 minutes of my life back."" I recommend any movies starring Chris Robinson if you want true cheesy horror/action."
1,I Am Shocked,"Shocked, I say, that this bear turd of a flick got 2 and a half stars on Amazon. The three dudes and one dudette exhibit consummate stupefaction by plunging into their plight, and POSITIVELY NO CREATIVITY in getting out of it. But that's OK, because the bear ain't no great shakes neither. YOU CAN'T EVEN ROOT FOR THE BEAR! That's how bad this movie is. Moral of this story: If you are an unmitigated moron, with no survival instinct, you could be chow for a big hairy beast. Worse, you might get stuck in a movie like THIS. If you are so thick that's never dawned on you, go ahead and watch this DVD. But don't say I didn't warn you."
1,Horrible Movie,Worst horror movie ever the ending really sucked that was even worse than Blood Monkey me and my dad watched this movie and we said the ending was crappy don't ever buy this movie it sucks. Its really bad.
2,Pretty boring,"Has a great plot and could've been ALOT better, I actually dozed off once and I never do that on scary films. Grizzly Park was alot better!"
4,Excellent tool,"Excellent quality tool. I bought it to prepare a piece of oak 1 1/2 inches thick for an intricate carving job and have been very pleased with the result. Precise, easy to use, does not shake."
4,Rampton & Stauber excel with citations/end-notes,Not quite as good as Banana Republicans or Weapons of Mass Deception. There were few surprises for anyone who has been following the narrative closely these past 4 years. The best feature of Rampton and Stauber's books is the attention they pay to citing sources for facts they present in the book. The endnotes are copious and most include URLs to source documents.
2,Roger Ebert is wrong--What a waste of time,"I found Gates of Heaven to be boring. In a nutshell, the movie shows that some people love their pets more than their human relatives. This observation is not an exciting new discovery. ..."
1,no idea what dvd folks saw that gave this film more than 1 star!,"short and sweet, i love animals. i read the 'great' reviews. fell hook line and sinker! this is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen. will go into my bottom 10 of my life! i fast forwarded thru most of it but how the heck is this getting these great reviews? its like watching paint dry on a wall! and one reviewer said this was her 'favorite' and she would be grabbing this dvd when she leaves this earth or something to that effect! this dvd was a SNOOZEFEST!!!"
2,The Disapointment,A very boring documentary about a pet cemetery and the maudlin interviews of the owners put me to sleep.
2,Doggone,"I love animals. I like documentaries. I respect Mr Ebert. Thus I bought Gates of Heaven when I saw it on his ""10 BEST"" list. Reading all the glowing reviews here, calling this ""one of the best American movies ever"", ""breaking down and crying afterwards"" etc, I suppose I am shallow, as I thought this was a boring, D-A-T-E-D, incoherent, S-L-O-W mishmash dotted here and there with some colourful characters and poignant images. I say ""dated"" because what seemed ""wacky"" and ""bizarre"" to people then, now feels like a bad mockumentry. I'd rather watch ""BEST IN SHOW"" , thank you very much. Just to put my view into perspective - I was deeply moved by the ""UP series"" (7-UP, etc), also on Mr Ebert's ""10 BEST"" list. I absolutely agree with his assessment and thank him for introducing me to those films. THIS one is at times charming, but on the whole very disappointing."
1,Do not buy!,It is right angle both ends!! and one of then brokes whe I tried to disconnect! Wasted money and time!
1,UNRELIABLE,"I've purchased about 6 of these, and when they DO work, they work well. But they have had a 50% failure rate after a very short amount of time. They just stop working, despite brand new batteries. They seem cheaply made. One them had to have the battery area taped shut more in order to work at all. It would be a great product if it were more reliable. I'm not sure if the more expensive models are more reliable or not, but if you buy this one, be prepared to deal with warranty issues."
3,"Works OK, Better than Nothing","1. For the size and price, its OK.2. Does not push as much air as I would prefer.3. Does not mount easily to non-standard kennels. I have a high end kennel (Zinger Winger) and had to use zip ties to keep the fan on.4. Eats the D batteries when on high. I usually use it on low in combination with a solar canopy.5. The solar canopy by ProSelect (Solar Crate Canopy in Silver) is much more useful in keeping the kennel and my vehicle cool. I got the large size so I could drape it over my the cab of my truck and easily move it around as the sun moves.6. I have seen more effective fan rigs with larger fans plugged into an auxiliary power source (cigarette lighter, or an additional battery for the serious working dog team)"
4,Have used these fans for years,"I have been using Metro fans for several years and have yet to have one fail (knock on wood). They get banged around and still keep going. We don't have heat issues often here in the Pacific NW but when we do, I pull out these fans, install batteries and away they go."
5,What a conspiracy thriller!!!,"If you haven't read the first book of this series, BUY IT NOW.The second book is even better. Roarke is even better then before and he has great supporting characters that just make this story leave you wanting more.I buy and read a lot of books from Amazon and have many favorite authors that I read but let me tell you, Mr. Grossman is the Man."
2,Biased and Too Much Detail,"First off, I agree with KeesLover's review. As seems to be the trend amongst many authors these days, the book leans heavily to the left fringe. Conservatives are bashed and made out to be gun-toting rednecks that want to take over the government. Quite humorous to say the least that an author can be so shallow minded.Secondly, the book is too detailed on information that is not necessary for the story. That is why the author placed a list of characters and their respective roles at the beginning of the book. If you have to list the characters and their roles at the beginning of the book to keep the reader aware of all that is happening, then perhaps the book isn't worth the read when many authors can tell a similar story without the minute details and character roles.I don't recommend the book. Took a long time to tell a rather predictable and short story."
2,Lame,A cheap mindless book to while away several hours of air travel. The author constantly repeats key elements of the story - almost as if he were trying to fill pages. The addition of a cheesy romantic story-line rendered this story almost intolerable. If I had something else loaded on my kindle at the time I would have quit reading it midway through.
2,Exciting Story but Poor Digital Editing,"The story was excting and just the kind of political adventure that I enjoy. The story line was interesting, but perhaps a bit far-fetched. I agree with another reviewer that the attack on the conservative media went overboard and caused me to ""fast forward"" through much of the dribble. Too much for its role in the story. My greatest dissappointment was the run-on of words which often slowed my reading and reduced my enjoyment of the book. Have never seen so many words run together....Not sure this was a problem in the printed edition, but my kindle edition was full of this and other editing problems."
2,A biased look at plato and his philosphy,"The book gives the impression of being very biased. It seems that Mr. Strathern doesn't like Plato or his philosophy very much. I wish the book was more neutral and allows the reader to make up their own mind or, at best, present both camps."
4,Plato light .... but not bland,"Strathern summarizes a lot of philosophy in a short book, but at time strips the meat out. This book tries to place Plato both in the context of his time and looks at the heirs of Plato in the Neoplatonists and impacts on Christianity (I thought this was a little weak). Strathern also reveals the paradoxes of Plato's life: decrying poetry but perhaps being the most poetic of the Greek philosophers and, leaning toward totalitarianism and lack of individual freedom, but being a very unique person. Strathern gives Plato 15 pages to speak for himself with selection from the Republic (of course the parable of the cave), Letters, The Law and others. Not comprehensive but worth the time!"
3,Lacks depth... very simple,"More biographical like most of the series. As regards Greeks philosphers that isnt too bad... entertaining book... but dont expect to come out of it much more ""enlightened""."
5,A Great Album from the Past,"I purchased this album (vinyl record) as a Sophomore in college in 1966, still have it in good condition. It's a great album, but since my turntable no longer works, I need the CD. Incidentally, the record jacket has the Lovin' Spoonful on the front and the Paul Butterfield Blues Band on the back."
2,Charlie Cologne,"I purchased 3 bottles of the Charlie Blue cologne spray as I was unable to find it anywhere locally. The shipping was fast, and well packaged. HoweverI just did not find the cologne to be exactly like I am accustomed to and I contacted the seller and they did offer me a refund for this product. They were very understanding and professional."
1,I can't stand the smell but it is a classic,"Bought this for Mother she loves it. I cant stand the odor, but a gift is for someone else and they like it they get it. It was big long ago, but it really smells cheap."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","This is a good radiator. Don't expect too much though. The one I got had a thermostat that worked half of the time. So, I ended up using it at full blast and often having to wake up in the middle of the night to stop it. I guess for the amount of money I paid it wasn't too bad. Probably it's better to pay a bit more and buy one from a store though."
3,new pads,Well have new bow so already have on bow so these go with my other string wish I new these were replacement for worn out parts or older bows
5,Three men and a Baby/Three men and a little Lady,I have really enjoyed both of these movies. I found them to be very funny and entertaining. I received them in a timely manner. I was very please with my purchase.
4,Three Men & a Little Baby / Little Lady,"I thought people wanted my opinion on the condition of the merchandise once I received it from the seller, but I've been getting request to share my opinion of the movie itself. I found this movie to be a really funny movie. They chose 3 great actors to pull this movie off and I believe they did a wonderful job playing clueless first time dads."
4,Star-power highlights this film,"Ted Danson, Tom Selleck, and Steve Guttenberg star in this light- hearted comedy about how 3 New York bachelors receive a big change in their lives after finding a baby on their doorstep. With humor that primarily surround the ordeal the 3 men have to contend with, 3 MEN AND A BABY relies on the chemistry the 3 main stars generate with each other. At first they experience dismay with the infant; I mean, how can three unmarried men take care of a baby?! But soon enough the 3 guys fall in love with her. But with good measure, a drug- smuggling subplot is thrown in (probably to make it not look like your a typical family-oriented comedy). Nevertheless, Danson, Selleck, and Guttenberg shine. The same goes for the cute little baby Mary, and a good direction from an unlikely director, Leonard ""Mr. Spock"" Nimoy himself!"
5,Twice the entertainment 1/2 the price!!,"I had forgotten how good these movies are. Ted Danson and Tom Selleck (sp?) are hilarious!! Definately a must have for any household! Also, the fact that you can get both movies for the price of one is great!"
4,"Two Flicks, One DVD.","Both entertaining movies in one convenient volume. The only issue is that both flicks are not widescreen versions--one is fullscreen. Otherwise, good value for the money, and again, convenient that both movies are on the same DVD."
3,Schoolbook,"The book came to us fast which was great, but after going through the book there was a page torn out of it. Overall I would buy from the seller again."
4,Intentional Interviewing and Counseling : Facilitating Clien,"The book was easy to understand and follow. I recommend the text to anyone that is involved in the counseling profession, teaching, and/or has contact with the public. The text teaches the basic techniques of listening and attending behaviors. It wasn't until I read this book that I realized how little I, and others listen to one another. Excellent for undergraduate and graduate level counseling programs. Very helpful text book but is not a keeper."
2,A college textbook for 2nd graders.....,"This textbook reads like it was written for an elementary-school level, offering little to no insight into actual techniques for Interviewing and Therapeutic Counseling. My professor taught straight from it, so needless to say, I was waiting for her to instruct us that it was ""nap-time"".I have purchased hundreds of college books in my career and most were more interesting and relevant than this one as well as less expensive!"
5,Intentional Interviewing and Counseling: Facilitating Client Development in a Multicultural Society,"Perfect condition, delivered in a timely manner."
4,Great textbook!,"I have been finding this textbook to be extremely informative, and one that I will be keeping for my own practice in the future."
3,Tall Barbie,My nine year old daughter was somewhat disappointed with this Barbie because the doll is taller and thiner than the standard Barbie doll. My daughter also did not feel that this Barbie looked like the photos - she thought the photos looked nicer than the actual doll she received. I actually thought the Barbie doll was very nice and had fun clothes and accessories even if the doll was awfully thin. My daughter did like the music video on this site that featured this doll and several others in this particular collection.
1,BEWARE!! CHOKING HAZARD,"When my daughter turned 6 months, I bought the MAM pacifier with the button knob since she loves to take the pacifier in and out of her mouth. I read the packaging and thought this would be easier for her than the ones with the handle (I previously bought Avent). However, one day she got the pacifier turned around and stuck the button knob part in her mouth. It got lodged and she was unable to close her mouth or pull it out. She was very upset and the pacifier started to block her airway. We quickly removed it and threw it in the trash. THIS IS A HORRIBLE product. The ""button knob"" is a definite HEALTH HAZARD. I will be going back to Avent."
1,out of date and too small to be useful,"This dictonary is about 40 years out of date, is missing basic Japanese terms, and is too small to be really useful. Look for a more modern and larger dictionary."
5,Excellent Program for Scholars,"I have been using Bibleworks since its beginning several years ago. It is not an easy program to learn, but it does have its own videos and teaching now which helps. If you take the time it really is a tremendous program for Bible scholars, seminary students, and those who are serious about learning. The program just keeps getting better with each version, and the latest Version 7 is a great asset with many improvements."
4,cute pillow!,"It is true that you shouldn't put this pillow in your baby's crib, but then again, this isn't the type of pillow that your child would be sleeping on anyway! It is really great as a throw pillow or accessory in the nursery, and as such it is an ""extra"" but cute addition. I agree with the reviewer who said that she wished there were more products in this pattern. I really love it and would purchase more accessories if they were available."
1,NOT FOR BABIES,"Why would Babiesrus.com not tell you that you cannot CANNOT put this pillow in with your baby! It's a sids risk! In fact, this pillow can only be used when the baby is A LOT older. Total waste."
2,not what I hoped for,"I thought it was a decent mystery.That aside, there are two types of novels I read: those I could recommend to my grandmother, and those I cannot. I read both, but unfortunately, this was in the latter category. And it's listed as a quilting novel, for goodness sake! The trucker's mouth on Benni Harper just wouldn't sit well with anyone else I know who enjoys quilting. Besides that, this book barely touches on quilting. For all that it affects the plot, she could be wrestling alligators. Disappointing, considering all Ms. Fowler's books have quilt pattern titles.If you are looking for a book that incorporates the spirit of quilting with a good story, I would recommend any of Jennifer Chiaverini's novels, or Alice's Tulips or The Persian Pickle Club, both by Sandra Dallas."
5,COOL,I LOVE BRATZ MY SCENE STINK OUT LOUD!THIS ONE IS REALLY COOL. MY FAV IS CAMERON AND CLOE. MY BFF MARY LOVE BRATZ TOO AND YASMIN AND DYLAN ARE HER FAVWELL THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAYLINDSAY AND MARY #1 BRATZ LOVERS AND #1 MY SCENE HATERS

5,THE FIRST OF MY 5 PICKS IF I AM GOING TO A LONELY ISLAND,"In my many years of listening to Jazz Vocalists, male and female and groups such as The Hi-Lo's, Lambert,Hendricks and Ross, The Manhattan Transfer, New York Voices and especially, The Four Freshmen, I have never heard a more pleasing treatment of chestnuts and newer tunes than this CD offers. This group of younger musicians and I say musicians because they are musicians who sing and not the reverse, are carrying The Four Freshmen banner proudly and offering their longtime fans the opportunity to introduce this wonderful music to the next generation. In my own humble world of rating CD's, the ultimate honor I can offer is finding my headphones and wanting to listen that intently through them. I found my headphones after the first tune. This is a five star and a five headphone CD. Do yourself and your loved ones a favor, BUY IT."
5,"The Four Freshmen--Still Fresh, Still Fantastic!","""Still Fresh"" is an extraordinary new contribution to the Four Freshmen tradition of jazz music. I grew up listening to the early Freshmen groups (#1, #2, and especially #3), and their sounds, vcally and instrumentally, have been the critical standard by which I have measured successive groups. This new CD reveals that the new Four Freshmen are in a league with those early groups. It is not, however, an exercise in nostalgia but a collection of new and exquisite arrangments (most by Greg Stegemen) beautifully sung and played by the new Freshmen. This CD will be a welcome addition to the music libaries of those who love the distinctive Freshmen sound or just appreciate good jazz music. Many of us hope this is just the beginning of a series of releases by these versatile musicains. It is the best Freshmen album since the early sixties."
3,Mixed feelings!,"It goes without saying that the singing and vocal arrangements are great on this disc but the production of the recording itself is not really of full commercial standard. It sounds like the countless attempts by novice producers using a Mac in their bedroom and was a disappointment on that score. Nevertheless, the input is so good that it almost transcends the lack of gloss to the production. I think you either want a live warts and all recording or if there's no audience, the expectation is for a little sweetening here and there and fuller instrumentation. Get the DVD of the current line-up to appreciate the talent of this amazing incarnation of a dying breed (if only The Hi-Los could be reborn too!)."
2,disappointing,"Gilbert is a very bright and able writer. I had read the reviews for ""The Normals"" and liked the premise very much - overeducated New Yorker, up to his eyeballs in debt, decides to get out of town and participate in a risky drug study.The problem is Gilbert feels compelled to describe everything in copious detail. This gets so bad that it slows down the story. Some of his observations are dead-on and I laughed hard. However, most of the time I felt he was trying too hard.The ending was terrible and I skimmed the last 40 pages.I hear good things about ""Remote Feed"" and will try that next. Gilbert needs to relax and just let the story flow a bit more. Hopefully the next novel he writes will be his ""The Russian Debutante's Handbook"" or ""Motherless Brooklyn."" He certainly has the talent."
1,Indulgent,"I loved Gilbert's ""Remote Feed"" and was eager to read this novel, but by pg. 140 I simply couldn't continue. The wise-guy prose, the elaborate language describing nothing, the John Irving ""Hotel New Hampshire"" madness forced on the proceedings and the most bland, ridiculous characters imaginable -- it's all absurd, silly, unbelievable.Great novels are about truth. This novel is an empty farce. I see a young and promising author turned vainglorious. While acknowledging that Martin Amis has made this pose a career, I wish Gilbert would try for more."
4,Very entertaining,"I picked up this book without knowing anything about the book or the author, so I had zero expectations.The language was too creative at times, but the fundamental story line was so entertaining I just kept turning pages.A great book for a summer vacation."
2,Communicate!,My review of this book is that it tries to teach you a bunch of things that are confusing and really un-meaningful when you stop to think about what they are trying to tell you.
5,Inadmissible Passion,"Fast paced, suspenseful, and a bittersweet past love that sizzles off the page. This book has a thriller edge to it that kept me turning pages late into the night."
5,Inadmissible Passion -- Admissible success,"A strong and interesting heroine, a conflicted hero and an intriguing mystery. Who could ask for anything more? A terrific debut from an author who writes with great maturity. I'm looking for many wonderful reads from Ann Voss Peterson.Jane Myers Perrine"
2,Polish - American Christmas Carols,The songs are right on but the vocals are borderline terrible. The male singer is generally off key and the female voice is screechy. I am very disappointed with the CD and could not recommend it to anyone.
2,the feline jury's still out,"i had high hopes for this product but our container is still sitting in the fridge ... the ingredient list sounds awesome, but both of our cats hate it sprinkled on their raw food. they prefer TC Instincts."
3,Abdominal training system.,"It isn't as strong as I thought it would be, but I can see my muscle flexing on one side. I thought it was broken on one side so I flipped it over to see if the other side would flex but the same side flexed again. I even tried it on my daughter and her muscle flexed on the oposite side so it is working properly I just can't figure out why we only flex on one side. All in all it is a good product. I just bought it to see if it really worked before I spent the big bucks on the Slender Tone one. Slender Tone even has shorts to work your bottom area."
3,Good but not what I expect,"It is not as strong as I though, you can feel the tingling and I think it works, it's only that takes time, you need to use it very often, but the product and the sellers are good."
3,"Entertaining, but are the stories valid?","This book was certainly entertaining and contained a number of stories that I plan on delving into further, but the book is really a mixed bag. Some of the stories are too vague to really warrant inclusion in the book. References are also a problem: there is a bibliography, but half of the short list are not ghost related; and those few references to contemporary newspaper reports are, sad to say, questionable. The one that I was able to check on was in relation to the ""Baldoon Mystery,"" which the author devotes a number of pages to. She claims that there was an article in the Spetember 26, 1894 Toronto Globe in which the girl Lettie McDowell relates an encounter... but I couldn't find it. So either the date is wrong, or the reference is bogus."
5,Love The Mole,When I saw that The Mole 1 was coming out I jumped for joy. This is the best reality show ever made! I only wish they would make more of it. This version of The Mole is a 100 times better than the celebrity editions. This show really makes you think. Even the price is great. Don't miss out on The Mole. Hope they release The Mole 2-The Next Betrayel on DVD too. Until then watch The Mole 1!
5,Why buy this?,I have only seen one episode of The Mole...but it has Anderson Cooper in it. That's reason enough for me to buy this!
5,One of the BEST reality shows ever!,"The Mole (not the celebrity versions), by far, was one of the best, most ""real"" of the new wave of reality series.Adventure, suspense, humor and a great host in Anderson Cooper makes this a must see for any TV person - not just reality TV lovers!The only fault may have been that it was too intelligent. You had to pay attention or you might miss something. It was, however, easy to pay attention because it wasn't paced fast and once you watched it once, you were addicted!My hopes are that we get to see Season 2 on DVDand that they somehow resurrect the series. With all of the poor reality on TV today, this would be ahuge hit! Keep the celebs home though!"
5,great reality TV!,"One of the best reality series ever made, see Andersen Cooper before he left to CNN!"
5,The Mole Season 1 DVD,"Purchased The Mole Season 1 for my 14 yr old son for Christmas. He loved it. He didn't waste any time watching it on Christmas day. As a matter of fact, our entire family enjoyed watching it. Great show!"
3,Hard to use,I thought this would be good for my [...]grandson who liked to explore plants and animals outside. We had a very hard time getting this to work. I would not buy it again.
2,Better than its predecessors...,"Made in UK in 2000, Serial GLASS-103-CD, Playing Time 76:54The record company responsible for bringing us the ""Live Rome 1974"" and ""In A Palesport House"" albums did somewhat of a better job on this release.The recording quality is poor but listenable, but there's been some sporadic editing in a few tracks. Still, it's a tolerable listen.Recorded in 1976 during the ""Interview"" tour, the set list includes ""Proclamation"", ""On Reflection"", ""Interview"", ""The Runaway/Experience"", ""So Sincere"", ""Excerpts from Octopus"", as well as the rarely heard ""Give It Back"" and ""Timing"" (with a very long violin solo), while ""Free Hand"" closes the disc.These CDs are for the true, unconditional fan. If you don't have any of these 3 discs, start with this one: if you can't tolerate the recording quality of the tapes used, don't bother with the other 2. The performances are good, but the sound quality is what will prompt you to listen to ""Playing The Fool"" instead."
2,"Poor sound - Basically ""Playing the Fool"" with a few more tracks","King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Rush, Jethro Tull, all good bands & I enjoy their music but, I LOVE Gentle Giant!!! They are, in my opinion, the best out of all of those bands. This recording, while many of the performances are good, sounds like it was recorded from a ""boom box"" (remember those?). I bought this CD for the ""Interview"" tracks for this was my favorite GG album (along side ""Free Hand"" & ""The Power & the Glory""). I really liked the performance of ""Timing"" until it got to the violin solo which, in addition to becoming monotonous after 5 minutes was also kind of annoying. (no offense Ray) After this solo, they don't go back into the song - by this time I'm actually kind of pissed! The thing is ""Timing"" is such a killer groove, very funky (killer bass line!) & rocks solid all at the same time - so try & understand! Aside from the ""Interview"" tracks, the rest of the CD is pretty much the same as GG's ""Playing the Fool"" CD."
1,"Works great at first, but then........................","I loved this DVD recorder when I first started using it. Then after about a month or two, I noticed that the recordable DVD was damaged, so I got rid of the DVD and put in another to record on. After about 3 recordings, this DVD became damaged also. I have gone through many DVD's and they all seem to become damaged after using it for about 3 or 4 tapings. I watch many movies on this and they are very clear, but the recording feature is horrible, if you have to keep buying recordable DVD's (which can get very expensive). I have even used Panasonic DVD's, which they recommend, of course, and still have the same problem. I am going to sell this one and go back to using my VCR until something better comes along."
2,1980's programming technology,"Nothing can prepare you for the non-user friendly operation of this unit. This unit is emmensely difficult to setup, program to record, and is the least user friendly of any device I own.I have Tivo, home theater, WIN 2000 computers, Mac computers, electronics galore, and this is a step MAJOR backwards in the era of user friendly operation. Yes it makes nice DVD's. Yes, they playback like any other DVD you own. But be prepared to ask yourself, is the user interface worth it? I say NO!!Unless you are a geek head with no reason to demand sensible user operation features, this unit is NOT for you.If you admire that we can have easy to use, program and operate systems like Tivo and Windows unstead of DOS then you'll wonder what Panasonic is thinking introducing this in the 21st century."
5,"The problem was mine, not the DVD","We bought this unit in December 04 and found that the pictures were badly distorted and snowy in comparison with direct TV reception. We tried every available combination of cables from audio-video to S-video to component and could not improve the condition.We assumed we had a defective tuner in the DVD. Sent it to the Panasonic shop and were told it was OK. Only then did we find that locating the DVD next to a VCR was the source of the problem.After we separated them, this unit worked perfectly and does everything it claims to do. Thought our experience might help someone else."
1,Oh . . . the pain. (A Biased Opinion),"If you are a fan of H.P. Lovecraft . . . reach for the blunted knife and gouge your eyes out before reading this dribble. The section entitled ""Unreadability and Unwriting"" is insulting on so many levels. Lovecraft is condemned for his stylistic addiction to adjectives (no mention is made of Howard and Smith who were also guilty of the sin of 'adjectivitis'). Pound and Hemingway certainly crushed Faulkner in the battle of adjectives and Timo is swift to pick up the standard of those dead paragons. He would do well, however, to read Tolkien's advice on 'recovery' as it deals with fantasy before Lambasting Lovecraft's child-like use of modifiers. Sigh . . . enough of this ranting . . . I have a book to burn."
4,Great Item,I bought this item for my daughter since was on sale and she owns alot of the girl Bratz dolls and I never bought her a boy Bratz doll. She loved it !!!! Great item at a fantastic price !
5,Review,This book is extremely useful to me. Good book to grasp concepts and apply towards learning. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to go through concepts.
2,Doesn't do the job,I was disappointed with this product. It did nothing to make eye shadow last longer - there are other products out there that do a better job. Previously I used Vital Radiance but it has been discontinued - that was the best primer I have ever used at a reasonable price.
4,Love it!,"I have sensitive eyes so the MK eye primer is great for me. It holds my shadow in place and it does not burn or sting my eyes. At the end of the day I just remove everything with the Mary Kay eye make up remover. It does not look like a huge bottle, but it sure does last."
2,You will be disappointed!,"First of all, the picture quality is very poor and grainy and the sound is weak. The photography is just plain and not very exciting. You can hear some music of Vangelis but be warned that no ""Chariots of Fire"" was included here. I prefer the music of Mr. Mambazo to that of Vangelis.I would recommend you to buy ""True North"" or ""Africa: the serengeti"" instead of this inferior DVD."
2,Not what I expected,"Just wanted to agree with the other reviewer about the overall quality of this DVD.The video looks like it was pulled off of an old VHS tape. Lots of grain and shimmering.Sound was OK I guess, but wasn't what one would expect off a newly released DVD, particulary when you know how much better it could have been if someone had wanted it to be.To sum it up, somewhere someone took the easy road in putting this DVD together as it is both disappointing in video and sound.Almost forgot, there are no extras on the disc."
4,impressive impresionism,"This is a wonderful mood piece. To see action packed lion kills, you're better off going to National Geaographic. For a peaceful reminder of the feeling of traveling Africa, this is it. This is one of the few videos that recognizes that much of the magic of Africa lives in people and places, not only the wildlife. This is a visual sampling of all the wonder of the Dark Continent, without distracting narration."
4,A Wonderful Way To Introduce Anyone To Shirley Temple!!,"This is a wonderful product! I recieved it as a birthday present from my parents and I loved it! It contains ""Baby Take a Bow""-about a little girl who finds a stolen string of pearls and keeps them in her home for a nosy detective to find. Her father is accused of the crime. ""Curly Top"" is about a lonely man who adopts an adorable little youngster along with her grown-up sister, whom he falls in love with. ""Heidi""...well you all know Heidi! The little orphan girl living with her grandfather who struggles to live a private life without people trying to take her away from him. All three films have been fully restored in colour with excellent sound quality...they almost match the standards of films from the early nineties. They all feature the darling Shirley Temple and come in a pretty red and gold box with cute pictures on it...totally worth it!!"
5,Great,It came in great condition. This is great little collection. She is the cutest!!! It through me back to when I was a little kid!!
2,"Buying Used ""like new"" gifts","Having always been a Shirley Temple fan, I wanted to introduce my daughter to her, thus I got the three pack. She already had the Little Princess and had seen Heidi on television. The problem with reading classic literature like Swiss Family Robinson and Heidi is that the language is often archaic for the Twilight set.If you are buying used videos that have been re-shrink-wrapped, but sure the vendor has rewound the VHS. It is embarrassing to have something look brand new only to discover that it wasn't rewound. Just advice to sellers.""Curly Top,"" too, is the ""Animal Crackers in My Soup"" movie which I had totally forgotten but which my daughter knew some of the words. Remember: Shirley Temple was one of the few child stars that didn't end up with major issues and went on th be ambassador to Ghana."
5,Great Read,Great read. Barbara Johnson never fails to entertain and leave you with some tips that will help you through life.
4,Battleball,"This game is major fun. A buddy of mine and me played this game from 8pm till 2am. I saw the Ad for it on cartoon Network, and thought, hey this looks like Games Workshops Blood Bowl, And I always wanted to play that. This Game cost less than 15.00 bucks when I bought it, better than the 50 dollar blood bowl title. Have No idea if the games are related, but if you like football, tactical stratagy, and mass carnage with cyberpunk overtones get this game. If you know any one who likes just one of these things get this as a gift. This game is simple to learn. Instuctions are 6-8 page pamphlet you can read in 5 min easy. The game will keep you enthralled for hours. Hoping for expansion teams, me and pals have tounaments starting up this week. Last thing, the manufacturer says this game is for those 8 to about 12, most people I know or have seen playing/buying this game are ages 8-40"
4,Fun game,We got this game for Christmas for our 7 yr old. We had never heard of it but it looked fun and it was very inexpensive. It looked a little overwhelming when you opened the box and saw all of the pieces but once our son and my husband got it set up and started playing they loved it. They play it almost every chance they get. The games do take a little while to finish and you need a pretty large surface ( like a kitchen table ) to set it up on but they say it is a really fun game. I really suggest this game but it may be one an adult has to play with the kid til they get a little older.
3,Nice for the price,"I purchased this game because of the quality of the components and the steeply discounted price at the Amazon/Toys'r Us outlet store. I was not disappointed.As other reviewers have mentioned, strategy takes a distant second chair to luck with both the basic and advanced rules. In a way, however, this adds to the games replayability--anything can happen. Not for ""serious"" strategy gamers, just ""beer and pretzels"" fun. It doesn't work at a party either since it is a two-player only game.If you can get it cheaply, go for it (the miniatures alone are worth the discount price); otherwise save your money for something with a bit more depth."
1,haven't played yet!!!,"Oh my gosh!! The directions are so long I have not gotten through them yet to learn how to play the game. Maybe they should put out a video on how to play. Right now I am trying to see if any of my nephews know how to play so they can teach us. Too many pieces, especially if you have little ones around."
3,No that great...,"Bezali's flute playing is uninteresting if not boring at times. I really can't detect any greatness whatsoever. The accompaniment is mediocre as well, I should add. The sound quality of the recording is above average and the repertoire is interesting. All in all, it's not on my top list."
4,"Very snug fit, but so far so good","The installation instructions were adequate and everything went well except that the battery is a little bit larger than the original iPod battery. It took a little bit of force to get it in. It made the top bulge a little bit where the headphones are inserted. I thought that this might cause a problem when putting the top back on, but once it was in and I put the screws in the top you can not see a bulge.The battery is charging right now, so I will update this after I get some use out of it. My iPod is 2 years old and the battery only lasted 30 minutes, so anything will be an improvement at this point. We'll see how long this lasts after a full charge."
2,"Not a ""drop-in"" replacement",Battery is slightly oversized making it even harder to install. The poor fit causes some parts to bend and it was very hard to put everything back in the case. After several weeks my ipod still works so no damage resulted. The screwdriver set is metal instead of the plastic ones some other sellers provide. The metal ones tend to gouge the case more than plastic ones so be careful. I haven't done a full battery life test but preliminary results are good.
1,Pass this by quickly!,I have been a fan of Gentle Giant since the 70's but this is horrible. Terrible sound quality. The band must really need the money. Buy Playing the Fool for a live GG cd. One of the worst cds I've ever heard.
5,"Love, love, love it!!!","My 3 year old boy is enamored with Milo & Otis so I thought I'd try this one out. First of all its a great deal to get this for $15. Secondly, my boy absolutely loves the movies and he even talks to me about Chance, Sassy and Shadow.The first one is heartwarming and exposes my child to the wilderness and things associated with it. He now knows that there are big animals in the woods and they can hurt him. He also tells me that rivers are big and dangerous, etc. The second one is funny in that it's really obvious that it's not the same animals, especially Chance. But it's got the same kind of lightheartedness.And now, thanks to Sassy my 3 year old now knows how to say, ""Ya flat faced butt sniffer."" Thanks for that, cat."
4,Great,"I mostly watch 'Homeward Bound 2' when I was growing up (It was the best). I can barley remember 1 or 2 parts of the 1st Homeward Bound movie, but I know I like the 2nd Homeward Bound movie."
5,Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey/Homeward Bound 2 - Lost In San Francisco,I enjoyed watching the first one (I haven't seen this movie for since i was younger). Loved the second as well.
1,unsatisfactory,"I am informing my credit card company that I am disputing my bill with them. On 9/22/08 I ordered from Amazon.com, was billed over the internet and received a bill with this order and paid $22.73 for Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey. However, I did not order but received, without any bill, a second dvd, for which $14.18 also on 9/22/08\. What are you doing???"
5,Amazing,Really good package at a reasonable price - even with shipping it to New Zealand. Reasonably quick delivery. Favourite classic
5,Informative,This is a really good book. I found it to be very informative. I would definitely recommend it to anyone seeking info about premenopause.
2,Lots of information,Choose this book cause I am approaching menopause. I am 50. Wanted to know what to expect. Lots of information.
2,To Scientific,Although the premise is good there is way to much scientific molecule configurations to keep your attention. It would be great if it had a section 'What to ask your Dr.'
1,Are you kidding me?,"This guy is a whack job! I'm all for the natural remedies. I like to think I have an open mind and I started the book thinking I would like to try some of his suggestions. This book is lecturing on the world today and how pesticides are ruining your body and everything around us. Birth control? Don't use any! Yeah, that's normal. I'll be sure to tell my 18 year old son that as he walks out the door tonight. ""Honey, if you choose to have sex, make sure you have her check her temperature and cervical mucus otherwise...."" No thanks! Oh, and don't forget the progersterone cream which is a cure-all for everything from heavy periods to cancer. I don't know if he has a contract with every company that sells this stuff but I can't think of any other reason he's pushing it so hard. Seriously, every chapter mentions it at least 5 times. ANNOYING!"
4,"Yes, but how do you. . .","If you need a book to give you an idea about a space and what to do with it, this is the book. Great photos and wonderful ideas. Unfortunately you will need additional reference material to get you from point A to point B (if you are a novice like me). This is a very good book to start with!"
5,Home Landscaping Texas Book,"Excellent pictures of planned landscapes that are actually usable in Texas. Very good for a beginner with no experience in planning a landscape. Usually gives a page number and picture of the plant used , which was helpful not only in recognition of the plant at the nursery but to identify plants that I have but did not know the name of. Gives diagrams in color for both shady and sunny areas, various sized property lots, front or back yards, and stand alone beds. Most useful book to help guide one in planning ones own property and still get the expensive landscapers look! Highly recommend."
4,Eye-Opening,"Mrs. Kjos is a wonderful, God-filled Christian who explains the dangers of spiritism from a Biblical perspective.Jesus DID say that the only way to the Father was through Him. Sorry for those that are offened, but sometimes the truth hurts."
5,Truth of Objective not Subjective.,"Dear Reader,If you enjoy to read books that stress what all Faihful Christians Believe, that ""Truth is Objective"" that Truth is reveled to mankind by God and we only can know God by what has been reveled to us by God, than you will enjoy this book.As an orthodox Catholic, I was delighted and pleased to have read this book, and recomend it to others."
1,Offensive to all non-Christians!,"This book is disgustingly offensive to anyone who is not Christian. It preaches the fundamentalist view that Christianity is the only ""One True Path"". It discusses spiritual individualism as being evil, and says that anyone who wishes to be an individual in a spiritual manner has been dangerously misled. Dangerously misled??? I'd say anyone who believes that his/her individuality is expendable has been dangerously misled.This book makes a mockery of Christianity by insulting and degrading other faiths. I would reccommend it to NO ONE!"
3,The Losers,"The Losers is a 70's based b-movie. Old school biker action not soo much.More like Old School Bikers on Yamaha's in Nam. Kind of a different twist. Called back to help the soldiers in combat. Loads of action, stunts, politics. Bad bikers gone good? Holds your interest."
2,The Losers,"Cheesey.The plot was OK but the acting, special effects , and music were terrible. I know it was filmed in the late 1960's or early 1970's but it was still sub-par for that era."
5,Erudite study,"An American Health Dilemma is a brilliant book, well-written and with a strong scientific foundation. It is clear and accessible to the non-specialist as well as the specialist. The first part of the book, a survey of racist thinking in the West, is one of the best summaries I have read in years. The book is interesting in its sociological, public health and social theory aspects. The notes are very clear, so that if you want further information you know where to find it. I highly recommend the book. It is a treasure trove of information, not only for Americans but for others interested to find out more about the perplexing question of race and health."
5,Been using it for years.,I've been using Cranactin for years for renal health when first recommended by a doctor as a quality product. Great stuff!!
5,Keeps bladder troubles away,"I take one of these daily and it keeps my bladder issues at bay. I have a past history of bladder troubles, some sort of irritation of the bladder lining, typically occuring after drinking alcohol. Since taking powderized cranberry for the past few years, these issues have not recurred. I'm told the cranberry acts as an antibacterial agent. CranActin is my favorite brand. (I also remember to drink a cup of water with every alcoholic drink, as alcohol was a big trigger for me.)"
2,Expensive,"Similar tabs are cheaper at Cosco, Sam's Club or Walmart and you don't have to pay shipping."
2,Big Disappointment!,"The storyline and the characters were intriquing enough to keep me reading all the way to the end. However, they were never fully developed and nothing was explained or resolved. I found myself wondering why certain characters and suppositions were thrown in since the author never went anywhere with them. Ms. Fowler should have taken time to at least connect some of the dots. She's too good an author to have presented this as a finished book! There are too many good books out there and too little time to read them. Don't waste you time on this one!"
4,Odd and interesting,"This is a very odd book. I bought it because I absolutely loved the Jane Austen Book Club. This book is nothing like it. The tone and feeling of the book is mysterious and secretative. You really don't know any of the characters and what their real stories are. The writing is very good and subtle. It slows you down, but not in a bad way. You just want to be sure you understand and fully appreciate every word before moving on. I like the character Lizzie even though she seems somewhat naive and believes too easily. The end seemed a bit rushed, but it was satisfying nonetheless."
2,Not Fowler's best,"Although this book had its moments, overall it was rather flat. Most of the characters were strangely listless, as if half-drugged. I would have preferred to read the story from the perspective of either Nell or Ti Wong rather than Lizzie; I suspect they would have put a little more sparkle into the story. I agree with the reviewer who found the staccato writing style odd and the plot under-developed. Your time would be better spent on ""The Sweetheart Season"" or ""The Jane Austen Book Club."""
2,On and on and on...,"After enjoying ""The Jane Austen Book Club"", I looked forward to another novel by this author. The story line never seemed to gather momentum and I persevered but was very disappointed. The characters meandered in and out of each other's lives, but Fowler wove a hazy and foggy plot, not unlike the weather in San Francisco."
2,"Maybe it's me, but...","I found this book extremely boring. I forced myself to read the whole thing because I'm a San Franciscan, but I didn't even feel it captured the city well. I kept turning back to remember who characters were, and as far as the plot...uh...did something happen? The cover is the best thing about this book."
2,Poor writing technique,"I was very excited to start this book, due to the fact that I live in San Francisco and am always interested in my city's history.However, I only got as far as the first few chapters due to the author's writing style.Every sentence is a short one. She uses no tone variation. The narrator's voice is staccato. She writes like this.And so on....All writers know that you need to mix up your writing with a blend of compound and simple sentences to keep things fluid. But every sentence is about 5 words long, and I was totally put off by that. I skipped ahead to the middle and end of the book, just to test it out and see if perhaps only the introduction was written in this style, but it pervades the entire novel.Oh well. I'm just surprised that so many people felt that it was 'fine writing' when it was clearly amateur. I was also surprised to see that this was not the author's only book."
3,Alright but scratches easily,"This is an ok product. The instructions could have been more straightforward, especially with the separate instructions for the net. The main issue that I had with this table is that it wasn't as durable as I thought. The table scratches easily and on the first week I had scratches on the table. I will try to be more careful in the future; however the table is not durable as you think."
4,A decent Watch from Reebok,"This product has many features such as the stop watch, timer and heart rate monitor. It comes with a band to put around your chest as the receiver. The reason I gave this product four stars instead of five is because I believe the heart rate monitor's accuracy could be better. When I am on the treadmill, at the same pace for five minutes, the heart rate will jump from 160 to 180 and back and forth."
5,Perfect Pick-up Sticks!!,"With all of the toothpick sized plastic pick up sticks for sale out there, I was thrilled to receive the Channel Craft's version of this classic game. They are very high quality, constructed of wood and perfectly sized. If you are looking for the pick up sticks from your youth, these are them!!"
3,Pretty but sparse,"I was hoping for more sticks. With so few, there isn't enough challenge for the older boys. I like the game because it teaches strategy and careful manipulation, rather than brute force."
1,very dissappointed,"In all my years in ordering from Amazon, this is the first thing I have sent back.The wood was different shades of brown, unlike the picture. The ""sticks"" were thick and heavy, not too challenging.I thought : ""who would like these "" ? and my answer was nobody ! So, back they went."
4,Before Conan there was Kull,"Howard's first barbarian hero. From Atlantis he --like Conan -- becomes a king. The stories are a mixed bag from the incredible (""The Shadow Kingdom""), the eerie (""The Mirrors of Tuzun Thune"") and straight adventure (""By This Axe I Rule"" -- which after failing to sell was later rewritten by REH as the Conan story ""Phoenix on the Sword"", with a supernatural element added."
4,Don't let the Movie scare you off!,"Kull is probably the best known character by Robert E. Howard other than Conan. Kull is also a barbarian and he bears some resemblance to Conan, though their adventures take place in a different era. If you liked the simple, direct action that Robert E. Howard wrote into the Conan stories you will love Kull!"
4,A KULL START,"ANY FAN OF HOWARD,S WORK MOST START A THE BEGINING OF HIS WORLD, AND THAT START'S WITH KULL. SO DON'T MISS THE START, OF AN EPIC HISTORY, OF HOWARD'S WORLD !"
4,Original fantasy,"The book Kull is a collection of short stories by Howard. I haven't read any of his other works, but I imagine them to be as good or better than Kull. Kull is an exiled Atlantian who goes through several stags in his his life before becoming King. The stages of Kull's life were laid out in a paragraph, which left much to be desired, but the rest of the book makes up for it. The stories tell of Kull as king and all the hardships he goes through. Most of the stories are great, but they take a few pages to become interesting also some of them are quite predictable."
2,Kull disjointed,The advance ads implied this was a single story rather than a disjointed review and groups of unlinked stories
2,kull or scooby doo,"some of these stories or so corny for example in the story Delcardes' cat kull invites a talking cat to live in the palace the cat's servant is throwing his voice into the cat to try to get kull to agree to Delcardes forbidden choise of husband. So Thusa doom the most powerfull necromancer in the history of the world is reduced tying up the cats servant and throwing his voice into the cat to lure kull into a deadly trap in the end thusa doom is unmasked in front of everyone, shakes him fist and escapes ""i'll get you yet kull"" so much for the power of necromancy, this story reads like a scooby doo cartoon this book is so corny it's kind of cool. Kull is worth a read but don't expect to much and don't pay alot of this book."
2,Same old thing,"I purchased this ""new"" board game and quickly found out it was a BORED game! There is nothing new here. Same old premise. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money"
1,Not on the must play list,"Purchased this game for my children (ages 12 & 13) to play with my husband and I. The kids were not at all impressed. We love to play games as a family and we are always looking for new things to add to our list. This game did not make the ""must play"" list in our house."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This books rehashes every maxim that has been trotted out in the financial services industry, and anyone who has been in the business more than a year has heard them all. The bio on the back really doesn't offer any credentials for the author other than making it sound like he made some money speculating at the top of the market. I'd be interested in how he is doing now? Finally, the book is way overpriced. The content of the book would comprise two chapters in a regular-sized book -- this book is the size of a Reader's Digest with huge print. I don't know who the other reviewers are, but get the feeling they must be the author's friends."
3,Stuff arrived. Thank you.,I recieved stuff behalf of your good company.one again thank you very much.I recieved stuff behalf of your good company.one again thank you very much.
5,Wonderful,A friend suggested that I check out this Anime and it is now one of my favorites. This series really was too short. I love it.
3,Not what I expected,"The idea of this little sleep sack seemed great but I did not have any luck with it. When my baby was a tiny newborn, he swam in it. Even when he got bigger, he was such a wiggly baby that he always managed to get bunched up in it somehow. Plus, he loved to sleep on his side and just never looked comfortable in the sleep sack no matter how I tried to adjust it. I finally gave up on these (I bought two) and packed them away. I did try one of the Halo sacks also with the same results."
5,Baby gown,The new baby loved this little gown. But not as much as mom. So I made sure I gave Mom several gowns
1,If only there could be zero stars,"I have been very reluctant to delve into the realm of the ""the ...bands"" and rightfully so..this CD is by far the worst thing i've listened to in 5 years..and i've had the honor of listening to the last metallica album...enough said!!The lyrics are redundant and predictable. Vocally unimpressive and musically stale. Dont be fooled by the cover art. Save your $$$"
4,Great Stuff,"I have another CD by The Afters. I am not sure why it took me so long to get this one, but I'm glad that I did.They have a very enjoyable pop/rock sound and solid Christian lyrics. There are several standout songs on this album. I particularly like the following: Beautiful Love, Until The World, All That I Am, and You. There are several other good ones as well.This is a real keeper. I recommend it."
5,AMAZING! !! YEAH DALLAS!!!,"I just got this album today and can't believe how good it is. Every single song is worth something. You can hear it in the guys' voices-they pour their heart and soul and everything they have into the music. The clear vocals just seem to soar over the music. It seems like this CD is too amazing for words.Songs like ""Beautiful Love"" and ""The Way You Are"" rock hard, thrown with a couple ballads, not to mention one of the best praise songs I've ever heard ""All That I Am"".My favorite track has to be ""Love Lead On"",though each song is soooo catchy that I'll probably have a new favorite tomorrow.The timing of this album can't be more perfect. The world needs more positive, good music. The Afters' messages of hope, love, and where to find them are all there. Plus, they're from Dallas (my hometown! go Mavs) and used to work at Starbucks. Can you get any more perfect than that?PICK UP A COPY RIGHT NOW!! I DEMAND YOU TO!NOOOOOOW"
5,Amazing...,I love the cd. I was also able to see these guys live. Amazing! I encourage everyone to try to get to one of their concerts. The guys are very friendly and funny. I enjoyed meeting them. Buy the cd...
2,Sorry for being different but I think everyone here is hyping this up...,"...to be something it's not. The only tracks that I found catchy was their song from 8th and Ocean ""Beautiful Love"" and ""You"". The rest of the CD is forgetable and bored me. So stay away!!Not recommended."
3,Nothing to write home about,"My complaint with 'I Wish We All Could Win' is that there is absolutely nothing original or different going on here at all. Textbook pop-alt that comes off as being very generic. Lyrically predictable and a bit cheesy at times; musically...ditto. If you can get by the lack of depth though, it's not a bad sounding album by any means. 'Love Can Make You Beaufiful' is a pretty catchy tune, one of the few standouts on the disc."
3,Look Out for Compatibility,"I bought this item at the Trinity College Library when my home computer was a PC. Good enough so far. Then I bought a Mac. That ended it. Don't be fooled into thinking that this CD-ROM is compatible with a late model Mac. It is not. I have written to the distributor to complain. For such a stunning visual work to be dead as a doornail in a Mac drive is downright criminal.Steven M. WolfVillanova, PA"
3,"Interesting documentary, not for everybody.","I found this film to be pretty interesting, although it is a budget production. The first half of the documentary focuses on digital artistry, creating the perfect girl with 3d computer graphics. They touch on virtual vixens in video games and the phenomenon of virtual pop idols in japan. In this part they have a bunch of short interviews and philosophical meanderings of the mind. The conversations have a hint of the whole 90's virtual reality movement. Then the film goes on to discuss advanced sex-toys and silicon love dolls. They also talk about art dolls like super dollfie. Much of this second part is in japanese and sub-titled. Some interesting footage, but not for everyone. All in all, not a bad film considering the subject matter (and the fact that there aren't too many other documentaries that touch on the topic). It is on the short side, just a little over an hour, but an interesting watch nevertheless."
5,WONDERFUL OLD TEXT,"For me, books such as this are actually better than some of our history books in print today. This is a text book for young women of high school age from the late 1920 to the early 1930s, i.e. before the Great Depression. Good grief, how things have changed! This book tells you everything from the various ways to hold a fork to child care to care for the sick in the home. It even has a wonderful section on the best way to destroy Bed Bugs! Do you know how large your table napkins should be? Do you know the proper way to light and maintain your wood cooking stove? Coal stove? Do you know the proper way to set your family table for brekfast? This and many, many other secrets of the great housewife are revealed in this work. To me, it is books such as this that make history much more lively. I love them. Recommened this one highly!"
5,Good Book,"I love books that help me improve me,and this is one of those books. There are 1000's of books to help you improve and this one should be on your read list..."
2,Self help book,it was a gift from a friend and I really didn't care for it. I don't care for much of self help books.
5,Golson on Argo,"This CD contains more than one LP's worth of previously issued material: the complete FREE LP and about 3/4 of the TAKE A NUMBER FROM 1-10 LP, both on Argo. FREE, recorded in 1962, gave Golson the opportunity to record what and how he wanted, and the results were good. MAD ABOUT THE BOY is a tender ballad on which Golson plays quietly but not shyly. JUST BY MYSELF swings nicely, and SOCK CHA CHA, with its unusual structure, is both catchy and dynamic. Tommy Flanagan's piano is a real highlight of the album. TAKE A NUMBER FROM 1-10, made in 1960-61 (the 1961 sides are the ones left out), is an add-a-musician-with-each-track session, beginning with just Golson on YOU'RE MY THRILL. Before the last track is played Tommy Williams (d) Albert Heath (b) Cedar Walton (p) Freddie Hubbard (tp) Curtis Fuller (tb) and Sahib Shihab (bar) have been added. Everyone plays well so that the clever (but not unique) concept works. This CD is well worth a listen."
5,Another great work!,"I must say, I have never been disapointed in anything writen by Tess. I look forward to each book she writes."
3,Good Book,"I was seriously enthusiastic about this book when I purchased it. I read up about the author and what inspired her to start writing and ditch her profession as an M.D. Harvest is a wonderful medical thriller. The medical terminology is pretty up there, if I wasn't in the medical industry I would definitely have been a little lost in some scenes. I really enjoy a good medical thriller, my favorites are by author, Patricia Cornwell. I don't think this book was as good as Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books but it was good--better than decent. There were a couple parts in the plot that were seriously annoying and some parts got a tiny bit boring but other than that, is was a worth-while mystery! I think I may give Tess Gerritsen's book titled Gravity a go in order to make a judgement on whether she is an author I will continue to read in the future."
5,Excellent!,"This is the first book by Gerritsen that I've read. This is as good or better than any medical thriller I've read before (and I've read them all by Cook, Palmer, etc.)The part about the children was heartbreaking, and that was tough to get through (I had to keep reminding myself that it's just fiction). But the rest of the book was fantastic! So exciting! I read it in one day.I wish there had been an epilogue. I don't want to give away the ending, but I did want to know that the three people mentioned at the end all become a family and live happily ever after!"
4,Fasten Your Seatbelt!,"This book is a thrill ride from beginning to end. The only things about it that kept me from giving it five stars are the four-letter words, (unfortunately, that's just how so many people talk), and the chapters about the Russians, which slowed down the overall tempo a bit, but, by the end, all that stuff about the Russians ties in with the rest of the plot.The first precept of medicine is, ""Do no harm,"" but this book tells of a small group of doctors who completely ignore this precept, killing people for their organs so wealthy clients can receive transplants on demand bypassing the normal, legal channels. The doctors involved grow wealthy themselves in the process, subsidized by the Russian mafia. (Those who might expose this plot mysteriously wind up dead, with the exception of our heroine, Abby, of course.)HARVEST is a fascinating, page-turning read."
4,Lots of Suspense,"A very good read, unfolds quite rapidly and holds the reader down. Interesting medical procedures and thrilling conclusion... I recommend this book and Ms Gerritsen is a remarkable mystery writer. Looking forward to her next book."
2,Oh Brother!,"This book convinced me that anyone can be a successful novelist. The plot twists are so obvious you could read this book by skipping every other page and still figure the whole thing out. About as challenging a mystery as the OJ Simpson trial. The sad thing about this book is how hysterical the protagonist gets. I mean talk about reinforcing female stereotypes. She's just a poor helpless doctor that shows all this compassion, yet comes undone under all this pressure, boo-hoo! So the book is predictable, but it was kind of an interesting story, especially since it's not a bad rip-off from the book ""Coma."" Ok, people can make money from selling organs. Now do something interesting with it."
4,Good read yet again,Reliable good read as most of her books. Enjoyed the suspense right to the end. Kept me reading all night .
5,Another Great one,"Like all of Tess Gerritsen' s books, once you start it, it is impossible to put down until the end."
5,page turner squared,Coma only better. Twists and turns till the end.You think you have it figured out and then she surprises you.This is the first non Rizzoli book I have read. I will now try the others
4,WOW !!!!!,"This book has it all! It's tense, exciting! Who is killing those patients Iam only half through this book and can't wait to see whodunit!!!!!"
4,Harvest - grim reaper thriller,"This is the first novel by Tess Gerritsen that I've read. It was so enjoyable that I've ordered two more from amazon.com. It is obvious that Gerritsen has a medical background judging by the fascinating details in the story. The story is original, gripping, and fast-moving with a woman as the heroine. The author skillfully combines exploited children from the former Soviet bloc, international trade in body parts, politics in a hospital, ambitious doctors, and the exhausting lifestyle of residents in a smooth reading medical thriller. I would recommend this novel to anyone, especially aspiring doctors!"
3,Middle of the road medical thriller,"The first Tess Gerritsen book I read was Gravity. That book was an excellent one and it prompted me to look into some of her other novels. I started with her first medical thriller, Harvest. It is a story about the rich patients bypassing the donor list to buy organs from ""generated donors"". An interesting and scary premise. Gerritsen excells when describing intense ER or OR scenes, unfortunately there are not as many in this book as I would have liked. Gravity was chocked full of action and suspense, this one has a bit less. An overall good book, Gerritsen fans will enjoy it; I recommend you begin reading Gerritsen with Gravity, however."
4,a good book,"This book moves along quickly while you're reading it but the real suspense, page turnig part of the book doesn't really kick in until 3/4 of the way into it. The story was very predictable, the dust cover gives away alot of it. Not a lot of character development. A good, quick read."
4,Harvest,"Tess Gerritsen always delivers on easy reading action which keeps you turning the pages until the very end. This book is no exception and,if you like Gerritsen, you will love this book."
4,Good to see where Tess got started,"I started reading Tess Gerritsen a few years ago when I came upon ""The Sinner"" and was caught by surprise at how much I like her writing style and the Rizzoli and Isles characters. I went on to read ""Keepsake"" and a few others, but was intrigued by the book that started it all. I really liked Harvest, the characters were engaging and the tone and flow of the book captured my attention and keep me reading. At times I did feel the deep dive into medical terms and procedures slowed down the story, however I still was ""turning"" the pages on my Kindle at record speed.Great way to start on Gerritsen great body of work. I recommend if you've only read one of her books to read this one next and go from there."
3,"A ""COMA"" Repeat","This was the first book I have read by Tess Gerritsen. 30 pages into the book I knew basically where it was going as this is a conceptual repeat of ""Coma"" by Robin Cook. The details are different and quite interesting but I don't like knowing where a book is going after 30 pages. If you haven't read ""Coma"" then you will really like this book. If you *have* read ""Coma"" then spend your time on another book by Tess Gerritsen."
3,Okay,"This is the second Tess Gerritsen book that I've read, and I must say that I liked ""The Surgeon"" better. I didn't realize that this was her first book.It had a good plot and decent characters. But her later book was MUCH better."
3,Good film.,I always enjoy sci-fi for the 50's. Life seemed a lot simpler back then and folks just enjoyed a good clean scare out of flicks like this one. Great effects for the day as well. A good way to spend a Saturday afternoon.
4,sensational sextapod! tantalizing test tube!,"this is a terrific example of harryhausen magic. missing appendages notwithstanding (and, let's face it, who would honestly notice if they hadn't been told?), the creature is a wonderful piece of animated model work.i'm surprise that noone else has caught (or mentioned, at least) the blatant sexual innuendo! the initial flirtation scene, when the captain corners the female scientist in the lab, is a riot -- check out how she's handling that test tube! then he proceeds to light up a cigarette (despite the ""no smoking"" sign right behind him)... hrmm..."
5,The Foundling,"Another Heyer gem!Adolphus Gillespie Vernon Ware, the Duke ofSale, is tired of all the pompous trappings of his position. A mildmannered and kindly young man, he's also tired of being treated like asemi-invalid child by his family and retainers alike. Longing for anadventure, he leaps at the chance to help a young realtive who haswritten some unwise love letters to an unsuitable young lady, and whois now being sued for breach of promise. What follows is a series ofadventures, some hilarious, a few somewhat dangerous, as the youngduke comes into his own.A truly excellent book. The young Duke ofSale is exactly the kind of romantic hero one wishes one read more ofinstead of the autocratic-almost-a-rapist ""hero"" one comesacross more often in regency romances today."
4,More Coming of Age than Boy Meets Girl,"This is one of Heyer's least 'romance-driven' Regencies, but it's one of my favorites. I really like the mild-mannered Gilly and his dashing cousin, and The Villain of the Piece is hilarious. The dialogue, descriptions, and historical inter-weavings are all top-notch, as usual. This ranks right up there with The Unknown Ajax, The Talisman Ring, and Sprig Muslin (none of which pay overwhelming attention to the romance part of the plot,and all of which are enormously entertaining)."
5,"Wonderful, as always","Different from her usual formula - but I liked it! More about the bromance. Been reading her books (and re-reading) all my life and appreciate the glow of feel-good at the end of each one. These are the only romance novels I read - and indeed, it's like entering into another world - one I know and love."
2,My least favorite Heyer's novel.,"Even though Heyer's writing style and wit are present un this book, I could not help being disapointed. This one is really not as funny as her other less romancy books like The Unknown Ajax, or The Talisman rings. To borrow from her, I'd say that I was in whoops over these two books, and only mildy amused by The Foundling."
4,A pretty good read.,"After reading the first chapter of this book, I had low expectations for the rest. Not surprising, since this is not my usual genre. I was pleasantly surprised, however. The characters, though unrealistic, were engaging and the plot exciting enough to hold the reader. If this is a good example of regency romance, I believe I will be reading more of this genre in the future."
1,Pornography in the Middle School,"This book has been in our middle school library, available to 6th, 7th and 8th graders, we are talking children as young as 11 years old. In addition, it is listed on the AR reading list as being a grade level 4.9 book. My 8 and 9 year old kids are reading at much higher grade levels than 4.9 and should not be subjected to the graphic sex depicted in this book... It is immoral and sick that we are allowing children access to this kind of material in our public schools."
5,Really Good Movie,Thise was one of the best show of that time and is still really good today alot of the other review's complain about the annimation its only different because it was realsed in the first season and they haden't gotted the annimation just right yet all in all really worth while movie which I still watch every Chritmas (its tradition)
3,My review as I see it,"After a long day of sleeping, I like to settle down and watch some cartoons.I turned on the TV and this came on.Being a fan of The Racoons, I found this special to be quite good, though not as good as the series.It was kind of crudely drawn, but it still had that certain something.In conclusion,I give this movie 3 stars.Thank you for your time."
1,We still have not received our order,We placed our order about a month ago and we still have not received it. I've email the sellers. They said to give it another week and if we still don't get it then they send out another one. I think i rather get my money back..
3,add leads you on,You think you get 6--18 inch tracks but you get 6--9 inch tracks. The add leads you on . I should read HO Code 83 9 inch Radius curve track {6}
4,Good Speed Metal,"If you're looking for a good adrenaline pumping speed metal band, then this is it! Inhumane Rampage is a better album, but this album is still amazing!"
3,Not as good as Sonic Firestorm or Inhuman Rampage,"I own all three of Dragonforce's albums, and this was the last one that I purchased. It definitely has a different sound to it than Sonic Firestorm and Inhuman Ramapge. VOtD isn't quite as filled with guitar shreddage and the overall recording sounds kind of echoey and hollow. I really like the sound of their last two albums better than this one. If you are new to Dragonforce I would suggest Sonic Firestorm and Inhuman Rampage, in that order, before you purchase this album. They have better recording quality and I think also better songs and overall a better sound."
4,Good but still not not excellent,"I know pretty few about them. They are English, that is all I can tell you. This album is actually pretty cool. Valley of the damned is their best song, it really rocks. Tha other songs are still good and some great, that really up to you to decide. It still cannot be compared to Rhapsody, Sonata Arctica or Stratovarius just to name some Symphonic power metal. But if you like these last, you will like Dragonforce."
2,Too much of the same thing,"What I mean is, just about every song on here sounds like the one before. No variety. Not to mention the fact that I believe the whole band is trying to see who can either out play the other before one drops on his face or who can play the fastest. Doesn't keep one's attention. Really the only good thing about this, is the album cover."
3,Unimpressed,"I thought that this CD would be new and refreshing after reading previous reviews. What I found was an attempt to be different but the results do not stand out. The way this band is different is the speed at which they play some of the songs - an all out break-neck pace on some but overall not that great re quality. I think there are too many power/progressive bands that simply don't measure up and this is a good example. Some nice melodies but not enough substance, 3 stars for trying."
5,100% Worth It,"Having already owned and listened to the original version of this album, I must say I am very pleased with this reissue. The songs are 'remixed and remastered.' Whereas the original album had a relatively poor production quality compared to their recent works, EVERYTHING sounds better this time around. The instrumentals and vocals sound great - crisp and clear, no static or bumps like the original. Highly recommended for fans of DragonForce and power metal in general."
4,Surprised,"I was quite surprised by the songs on this album considering that I bought it along with Ultra Beatdown. It is certainly not as diverse as their three other albums ahead, but it has a nice level of originality that can only be found on this album. Dragonforce put together a good one for their first release. If you like Dragonforce and want the whole collection, you won't be wasting money on this gem."
1,Am I nuts??,"Imagine pulling the vocals out of ""progressions of Power"" by ""Triumph"" throw in a Hell of a lot more of the same notes and speed it up and put the vocals back in---You now have Dragonforce-Triumph on Speed....."
1,Tired & Trite,"Egad! These guys are like STYX with twice the speed, twice the attitude, half the talent, and even less songwriting ability. Put the power chords to bed boys, slow down, and learn some riiffs! Some of the thinnest syrup I've ever tasted..."
4,Puzzles are great,"I bought these for my grandson who doesn't like the usual learning toys, but loves tractors. I'm hoping he'll love and learn at the same time."
2,ALLERGIC REACTIONS ARE NO FUN!,Be CAREFUL! If you have sensitive skin or nickel allergy(i.e.-can't wear fake jewelry or earrings)You may want to cover this with a condom or silicone sleeve. Worked okay and did its job alright but it is a little scary that it gets so hot. I developed an extremely itchy & uncomfortable skin rash on the verge of infection from using this silver colored bullet so I will not use it again. Use at your own risk!
5,omgggg,this product is amazing and for the price you cant beat it. I use it when im not with my fiance and sometimes with him. Its great if your very sexual such as myself. very powerful
3,very powerful but cheaply made,"After the first day the battery comartment door broke on the hinges. Still works without the battery door, but it was def cheaply made :("
5,Definitely my new fave!,"I have always been a silver bullet enthusiast. I made the mistake of leaving my collection behind and needed something to hold me over until my return. This little bullet does the trick EVERY time whether I've been solo or with my husband. For the price, everyone should have one handy."
1,"buyer beware ,false advertizing","be sure to check the size-very small, I did not but expected a laundry basket not a 2 towel basketfor the price I expected better and the color is orangecost too much to send back, I got screwed"
3,PMD,I like the laundry basket but for some reason the handles keep breaking. This is the second type of laundry basket I have owned and the same thing happened to that one also. The manufacturer should make these handles stronger because wet cloths weigh a lot.
1,Laundry basket - woven-willow,This basket is poorly made and would not last for three months. It feels very brittle and I can't imagine putting laundry in it for fear it would break.
1,Was definitely not what I expected,I was very disappointed with this product. It was cheap looking and the material man made and not natural. I was surprised since I have always had good luck with Amazon products. One thing to note it was very easy to return using their system.
1,"DO NOT BUY, unless you want an ORANGE basket.","I bought this for a baby shower gift to put all my gifts in. I had gotten a similar dark brown one for another baby shower and it turned out really cute. However, I got THIS one in the mail and it's ORANGE. As orange as a basketball. Luckily, I was able to swap the two and used this one for a baby boy (I was reassured the orange would be ""okay"" for a boy's gift) and used my dark brown one for a baby girl. I would have returned it but I would have had to pay shipping to return it. Plus, I had used my Amazon Prime account to get two-day shipping because the baby shower was in just a couple of days. I wouldn't have gotten a replacement in time. VERY UNHAPPY."
1,Awful color!,"I'm sending the basket back. The description was natural, the basket was an orange color. Not exactly what I was looking for."
1,NOT WHAT I HOPED FOR,"The cotton liner is necessary because color from the cheap paint bleeds. I was hoping to carry clean but wet laundry in it, but the cotton liner when wet takes color from the weave. To store dry clothing, dirty or clean, is probably OK."
4,Wicker Basket,"Happy with the basket, the color was a little more on the red side then I wanted but it will work out just fine"
1,$11.85 + $24.40 shipping,Shipping is outrageous. It rasies the cost over 200% of the worth of the product. Too bad it was the basket I was looking for. I'll surf the web and try some where else.
2,"a really small ""laundry"" basket","This is very small for a laundry basket. About half the size of a traditional wicker laundry basket maybe fit half a load of laundry. Pretty much a total waste of a purchase for me. They really should give dimensions. For the record, 18"" x 13"" x 10"""
1,Laundry Basket,They should tell you this is VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY ORANGE wicker and very small - no diminsions
2,Wow,"So, does the picture reflect a bight orange color? I certainly didn't think so, but bright ORANGE is the true color. It's now spray painted white and holding plants outside."
3,Eclectic and unusual...but not really much of a keeper.,"Aki Kaurismaki obviously worked very hard to create an eclectic and appropriate soundtrack that created the proper mood for the film. He has a very keen ear for music.On this album, you'll find Japanese lounge music (Motto Wasabi by Maso Onose), Finnish folk music (Paha Vaanii by Marko Haavisto and Poutahaukat, Bandoneon by Antero Jakoila and Lukki by Tapio Raufavaara) and a smattering of folksy pop-like tunes with the exception of track five. Half of the album is in Finnish and the rest is instrumental with a smattering of English language songs.To be honest, the album really isn't good for numerous repeat listens, as intriguing as it may be for the first few times. The music is obviously best when framed within the context of the film and not isolated as a CD soundtrack."
2,Grace notes out of tune...,"A very disappointing and ordinary book - I cannot believe that it was nominated for a booker prize. You just cannot try to write about music in these terms - certainly most musicians would never do so. The main character was such a whinge, mean, selfish - the relationship with her father never properly explained, Northern Ireland dragged in without any real depth or discussion of it. In particular, he never really explored her use of Lambegs (ostensibly a protestant instrument, but actually used by both sides once) by her (a catholic). The end of the book could have been from a Hollywood Meryl Streep movie. The long, free-form structure of the book didn't work particularly well either - moving from the death of her father back to a birth, and building up to the gestation and performance of a piece which seemed totally unrelated to the opening section of the book. Some good writing, but frustrating and annoying."
4,EH?! Where's The Wicked Day??,"Stewart's fabulous Merlin ""trilogy"" is actually four novels, the fourth one being ""The Wicked Day."" I can't see why a publisher would have left this one out of the compilation. This is why the review gets only 4 stars. I also feel like it would be a bit ridiculous to have this compilation on the bookshelf followed by an odd copy of The Wicked Day, so, I suggest you buy each novel individually if you like the way books look on the shelf.This is a marvelous set of books, quite readable, and it does put you into the story!"
5,One of the Best!,"I read this book about 25 years ago. I never forgot the world that Mary Stewart created for me. Like ""The Mists of Avalon,"" she puts her players into real life, not just fantasy! Loved it."
5,These books are treasures to be read again and again!,I have read all the 'Merlin' books. I have read them countless times and they just get better and better with each reading. They put Magic in the air and give you a fantastic read. You can't put them down until you finish.
5,Yo encanto!,"Wonderfully described were the characters, the history, and the surroundings throughout the story. I fell in love with this book the moment I started it, and was enraptured until the end. Mary Stewart writes the most romantic stories I've ever experienced!"
5,Addictive!,"These books are what got me started on a lifelong fascination with the Arthurian legend. I never expected to be so enthralled, but by the time I was done with the first book, I was glad I hadn't picked it up before the other 2 were out - the wait would have been excruciating!"
5,first time user/buyer,I was amazed at how quickly the book arrived. Fantastic! Also the condition of the book surprised me. It is in mint condition. It is just like the one I had as a child so I am very happy. My experience with this first time buy has left me with a feeling of confidence. I will be doing this again.Sandy
4,"Realistic ""fiction""","I have just recently gotten into the Arthurian Legends. Compared to other novels that I have read I was relieved to find this trilogy somewhat realistic. Merlin throughout the entire telling emphasizes that it is not magic that aides him in all his adventures, just luck and vision. Most novels descrive Merlin as a magician who is able to change, fly, etc. I really enjoyed this book, and Mary Stewart's way of knowing all the names of places that existed long ago is impressive also."
5,This book is a masterpiece.,"I have read this trilogy over and over, both in English and in Russian translation. This is a masterpiece, which can stand along with such classical works of literature as Bulgakov's ""Master and Margarita"", Alexander Duma's ""Queen Margo"", Charles Dickens' ""Domby and son"". Mary Stewart not only impresses the reader with a human wisdom of her book, she also describes splendidly the beauty of Wales landscapes. She makes the reader feel nature with his heart. This work is a deep look inside a human soul. Mary Stewart shows us something that is universal for all people. The book is just marvelous, both as a historical discription of Arthurian epoche and as a psychological novel."
4,impressive,"this book is a delight to look at as well as read. The quality paper and bindings are impressive.Read this years ago,and when my grandchildren showed an interest in Merlin and King Arthur,I knew this would be perfect."
5,"Old world, Classic styling.","I am now thirty five years old and have known this series since I was a young teenager. I have been so spoiled by this telling of the Arthur legend that I am almost disappointed before I even begin to read any other account. This is truely second to none due to Mary Stewarts classic and human approach, her flair for suspense and attention to almost poetic detail. I have fondly read epic fantasies before but would guard against placing this tale in quite that catagory, rather I would call it a 'Classic' in its truest sense. It brings history, humanity and heart together in an inspiring, timeless tale. All of Merlins magic is where any of ours can be found, in his soul. If you love medieval but can do without elves and fairies, this is the one for you."
2,just not what I expected,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. However, it is not the Merlin I expected. This was not a Merlin with magic, but an ordinary man with the ""gift"" to occasionally see into the future. Then he thinks up a way to make it happen. When I realized this I wanted to put the book down, but I tortured myself and finished the book. I thought it would get better, but it didn't. I asked my friend if the next book made Merlin more 'magical' and she said no. So I wont be reading the next book. Don't bother reading this if your looking for fantasy and magic."
3,"A good book, NOT a masterpiece","For over a year now I have been reading arthurian novels. some better then others. I was startled to see a book with such good rating being as it is that my favorit book in the subject has four stars and a half, and so naturally I bought this book.I must admit it is very fluentlly written and has a nice concept. Yet there is a very big distance from that to a five star book, yes this is a nice book, but no it is not a book that you feel is calling you whenever you don't read it and no, not a book you feel very sorry and reluctant to finish. The beginig of the book drags on and the author tends to get swept up in discriptions.I would however like to say it is a nice book to read if you have some spare time."
3,"Works, doesn't last forever","The heart rate monitor was given to me as a gift. Its not a big name brand when it comes to this market segment, but the product worked well straight out of the box. The only issue I have is I had it for about a year and the battery conked out on me. Not a huge deal, but thought there should be a bit longer life in the battery. Functionally, it does what it says. Displays your heart rate, highs and lows, time in zone, etc.If you are starting out with the whole HR thing and do not want to go big with a Polar or such, I would definitely say get one of these and see if the functionality meets your needs. I don't think you need much more than what this has to offer."
3,Another disappointed buyer,"I bought the book when it first came out and I wanted some basics but found the book more attractive than instructional. After having gained a lot of hands-on experience with fiber dyeing, I picked up the book to see if it's more useful. Sadly I found it even less so.I'm not sure the writer or her editor knew just which audience to target. For novice dyers, there are plenty of sources for finding more details on how to handle different fibers and which dyes to try. For the experienced dyer, there aren't any striking and different approaches to tackle. It's a lovely book to browse through but not much of an investment for your library of references."
2,Disappointed,"After all the positive reviews of this book - I was unhappily surprised by how much I didn't like this book.I felt the writing style was odd. And whether or not it was style, simplicity or bad research, much of the information felt simplified or dumbed down. I thought that many of the example pictures were classic examples of what not to do with busy yarn and textured patterns. Even though the book is called Dyeing to Knit, I felt that there was very little discussion about designing yarn colors and patterns for a goal finished project.I was also very disappointed in the patterns, I thought that many of them were pretty awful, and the only one that I would knit at all was so basic that one hardly needed a pattern to knit it."
1,Wrong Picture of Product,The picture here is not the right picture!! The picture is one of a CardioSport heart rate monitor when the one for sale is Reebok brand!!
5,A powerful study in violence,"Stripped is Brian Freeman's second novel and builds on the personalities we first encountered in Immoral. It is a remarkably believable and powerful study in violence and how past events can come back thirty years later to haunt you. The personalities are totally believable, the action is on-going and at no point do I figure out how the novel would end. I strongly recommend it."
4,Parts were Better Parts were not,Stripped is major step forward in one sense and a step back in another for Mr. Freeman. In the guise of a mystery he has begun to explore his characters in greater depth. He especially is adept at dealing with the relationships between Stride and Serena. Amanda also was an interesting character. Also the description of Las Vegas was interesting. There was a strong sense of the place that was riveting. This development was fascinating and a sign of progress.On the other side I thought the plot of Stripped was a bit convoluted. There were so many twists and turns and so many unanswered questions or events that did not make much sense. Even the ending was a bit disappointing. I thought that Freeman felt that he needed every twist.I will wait for the third book to see if the better continues and the plots tighten.
5,Who Is This Guy,Seems like he's come out of nowhere to provide a very suspenseful tale. Many plot twists in this one with an unpredictable outcome.
4,Good characters and lots of movement going on..,"This is the first book by Mr. Freeman I have read. For being early in his writing career, it flowed well, with well developed characters and above all a fun sense of humor. I enjoyed this and will now read more on the series and his new book in the future."
3,would be better if...,"not so much about the personal lives of the cop and his latest woman..at least for me, if feels as if the writer is trying to make his wordcount add up as he tells and retells how much in love they are, and tells and retells the sob-story of Serena's past...i guess I would like to read a mystery where the female cop wasn't show-stoppingly beautiful (not very true to life :) and has a hideous past...or maybe this is a prerequisite to be a cop...anyway, to me, it all takes away from the plot of the crimes going on, which are complex and all of the lovey-dove stuff takes away from this for me at least..."
1,Stripped Boring Read,"I have read several Brian Freeman books but found his book Stripped to be much too long and boring. It has a good plot but too many subplots that had no place and were unnecessary to the story. The whole subplot about Serena was boring and a waste to the plot of the book. As a result of reading this book, I am reconsidering reading any more Freeman books. I loved some of his previous works and wish Maggie and Stride were back again."
2,Slow Read,"In this follow up to Immoral, Detective Jonathan Stride has left Minnesota for Las Vegas. He's now living with Serena Dial, a detective from Las Vegas that was introduced in Immoral. His new partner is a pre-op transexual named Amanda. Add in a murder from Reno and 2 murders in Las Vegas that merge into one case, which in turn connect to the muirder of a Vegas showgirl from the 1960's. Given all of that this is a very slow read, and I ddin't care about any of the chareters involved. Skip this one."
3,Great cookies- BAD packaging!,These cookies are perfect for our Mickey Mouse themed Birthday party- however when they arrived- 8 of the 24 cookies were broken!! I can't give out broken cookies in the treat bags! When I called Amazon they issued a refund for 1/2 the cost ($12) because the item was not in stock at the time I called so they couldn't replace what I had ordered. I'm very disappointed that they don't have them packaged differently for shipping. They are perfect- if only they weren't broken!! Why sell something that arrives broken? Please Amazon change the shipping package for this item!
2,Blah,"These cookies really are adorable, but they taste HORRIBLE. I bought them for my 2 year olds birthday party, but the kids wouldn't eat the cookies. They broke them into pieces, but wouldn't eat them. I couldn't even get my dog to pick up the pieces off the floor. They get two stars just because they are beautiful cookies. Just don't plan on eating them. Also, we had both girls and boys at his party and it was a little disappointing to the some of the girls to end up with Donald or Goofy. What happen to Daisy???"
3,Solid Collection of Lesser Known Artists & Renditions,"This is a nice roundup of some lesser know tracks and/or less known artists covering well-known samba tracks.If you have a couple hundred samba CD & records, then you might add another star to this review since you do get a lot of tracks on CD that is probably hard to find even on LP.If you're just an average samba fan looking to add to your collection, you should put this series on your list but only after you've acculmulated a couple hundred other samba discs first.It's nice, interesting and pleasant overall. But the ""must have"" to ""pleasant listening"" ratio for most average listeners is not high enough to rank this disc as EXCELLENT (4 stars) or CLASSIC - MUST OWN (5 stars). It's good. It's solid but it's not amazing."
1,"Not even close to an ""old"" Dremel","My 3981-01 got stolen a few days ago, and I picked this up as a replacement since the box makes it sound like the next best thing since sliced bread.This Dremel is far shy of the quality of my old one -- it's definitely cheap plastic, with even cheaper button & dial materials. While the additional RPMs are all well and good, I highly doubt it will last long in regular use. Looks like it's off to RotoZip for me!"
1,Dremel 400 burns up on first use,"Length:: 0:22 MinsThis was the first time I had ever used a Dremel. I had just bought it 1 week earlier and decided to go with 400 XPR. What a disappointment, even though it felt kind of cheesy in your hand I still thought it was a quality product (From what I've heard in the past about Dremel) I was so wrong! I had not been using it for more than 10 mins before it overheated and had a meltdown. Just so you know I use METABO and End grinders at work everyday, and I know to let the blade do the cutting and not to force the blade. What a piece of junk! Maybe the 300 series is better, but to late for my business. DO YOU HEAR ME DREMEL!!!look me up at http://www.youtube.com/user/WestCoastModsLazyMan"
1,So poorly made it's dangerous!,"From day one I had a problem tightening the collet. No matter how hard I held down the shaft lock button, I would feel it tighten and then click and spin past the tight position - just going around and around and never truly tightening. Numerous times the metal bit flew right out while the tool was running. Once it flew out with such velocity I never saw the bit again (couldn't find it). Finally the metal teeth of the collet broke off and the thing is now unuseable. I also had the same problem as another reviewer where the switch gummed up and could not be slid from off to on without the help of a screwdriver or such. And there was no documentation describing what the different bits are for - pretty stupid."
3,Decent tool for its use.,"I bought this dremel for small project work in wood, plastic, and aluminum. I've also used it for a little tile cutting. It's worked well without issue. I don't understand all of the negative reviews I've seen here.The case and included pieces are varied and useful."
1,Burned out first time in use,"Very disappointed. Motor burnt out spectacularly first time out, with a very minimal job cutting fine silver wire with a jewelers saw. Complete waste of money."
2,Looks great on the infmercial... not when it comes to real use,"Albeit, to counter my review title, for small jobs, the Dremel is useful and handy, plus the high RPM allows for expert cutting, sanding and grinding (after lost of practice). However, for the price, you really don't get much. The product is forever dependent on Dremel accessories, heats up a LOT at high RPMs, can't handle any type of real work (this is good for small projects as I said, nothing of contractor grade), and does not have a trigger switch, which I think would help a lot.If you really want a Dremel, go to your local auto store and buy the Chinese version of the tool for $19.99... you'll save money and it will do the job just as good."
3,No Complaints,"They are very cute figurines, and my 8 year old son has them lined up on his nightstand with his Angry Bird Star Wars figures. They are the first people figures he has ever had an interest in."
4,Does the job!,"Deoxit is a legend in its' own time; many electronic components have been restored by this product.Mine came in a pressurized can with three spray settings: Low, Medium and High spray force. I used only the Low setting on my 35 year old Teac EQ-20 graphic equalizer, and that setting was really powerful; use extreme care when spraying! I wear eyeglasses, and had to clean spots of overspray from them twice. The can warns against getting the Deoxit into one's eyes, so always use eye protection when using it. I recommend spraying this product into a small cup, and then using a Q-tip or other tool to apply it to the part you are treating.The Deoxit treatments (two applications are recommended) cleaned up the sliders and push buttons nicely, but unfortunately the overspray damaged the graphic display on my Teac, so I am replacing the unit with a new equalizer purchased from Amazon.com. I will be reviewing that component as soon as I place it into use."
4,Works great but not easy to control how much comes out of the can,Not much to say about this product except that I've used to restore knobs and switches on several vintage portable Panasonic and Grundig radios and it works great.I deducted one star because its very difficult to get just a small amount out of the can. You press the nozzle and keep putting pressure on it until all of a sudden a bunch sprays out at once. I wish it were easier to get out a small amount.
3,eletrical spray,didn't fix all the problem but helped ended up buying new harness. This stuff does pretty good only connections. But still had my own problems in my wiring harness could not get it to work.
5,Worked Really well..did NOT harm 30 year old plastic,"I used this on my 30 year old Sony TPS-2 Walkman player. On the dual slide volume controls and the ""hot"" button. Completely eliminated the scratchy noise when actuating these control keys. Smooth as silk! Works as well as Blue Shower product."
5,Great stuff!,I have an old 1960's Panasonic Quadrophonic receiver which I use in my basement when I'm working down there. The knobs & dials were all gummed up & the 4 speakerswould take turns dropping out.I would have to constantly fiddle with the knobs to get any of the functions to work properly & then they would cease working again after a few minutes. E.G. - I would have to find a spot on the knob somewhere between AM & FM to get reception on either band. Quite annoying. After a few squirts of this product everything is working like new again. It worked instantly - like magic. It took all of 2 minutes to restore my old friend to working condition.
4,DEOXIT D5 SPRAY,"This is good stuff for cleaning vintage stereo rheostats and switches, the only problem I encountered which is why it did not get 5 stars is the extension was a beast to get into the spray nozzle. I highly recommend this product"
2,"Mediocre, repetitive, irrelevamt","""A Consumers' Republic"" is one of those kinds of books that exists on the premise that it illuminates some previously unknown phenomenon. The book purports to be a ""bold, encompassing, and profoundly influential book."" I humbly propose that this book is none of the above. ""A Consumers' Republic"" is certainly not a ""bold"" book. Quite tepidly, actually, the author makes a weak case that is essentially a rehashing (and a mediocre one at that) of mainstream academic criticisms of popular market culture. Certianly nothing new, the ideas lamely presented by this author were actually prefigured by a factor of centuries by actual scholars such as Smith, Marx, and de Toqueville. Not bold for sure, but also lacking nuance; ""A Consumers' Republic"" condescends to its readers and its subjects alike. And is this book ""profoundly influential,"" as the jacket pompously asserts? I hope not."
2,Not much value to it,"This book has little value to current IT managers, and anyone with a business degree or MBA has already learned more than this book has to offer. There are no new theories, and the book reads like a combination textbook and self-help guide. As such it never finds a good focus. A quote from the jacket says it all:This book ""...will help you improve your ability to plan your work, meet your commitments, and do so while being an effective political actor.""If you need a confidence boost, then maybe you'll see some value to this book. But the cheering section doesn't produce many valid techniques for actually ""doing more with less."" The book will leave most readers looking for more solid fare."
5,IT people - this is the most important issue in IT,"The movement from islands of IT to a Service Oriented Architecture requires skills and talent. Unfortunately, the pending baby boomer retirement may cause the transition to slow as the quantity and quality of IT resources diminishes. This book put the IT professional back at the top of the list by addressing the critical issues facing IT personnel and IT Management. How do we do more with less IT people? The answers are structure and consideration of the IT personnel in your organization. I enjoyed reading the book and have already applied many of the recommendations in my consulting business."
3,"Well, its a social welfare textbook.","This book is actually one of the better textbooks I've been asked to spend some time with--and there have been quite a few. The chapters are long--30+ pages, and its the typical dry stuff...but its current which helps keep it interesting."
2,Text for social welfare course,"My biggest concern about this book is that the content and analysis is very outdated, and should not be a primary text for current social welfare intro courses."
4,Speedy!,"I ordered this book for school, and it was a fast and speedy process. I definetly got it before school started. And it was in good condition!"
2,Oudated,"This book was older than I had thought and much of the information was dated. The publishing date was listed when I purchased it, I just wasn't paying attention that day I guess!"
3,What may be a flaw ...,"... in design keeps this product from being great: the top fits loosely, which is not good when you're trying to keep coffee beans fresh. Otherwise nicely made."
5,Functional and stylish canister,This is my fourth purchase of this canister. They look great and do everything that a canister should do.
2,"Great for AM/FM, Crap for CD's...","I purchased this radio in order to use on a shelving unit in my bathroom, i.e., the radio needed to be small, and this was perfect. However, after very little use, the CD player began having a very hard time loading the CD's, and sometimes wouldn't play them at all. After a while I gave up and just started using my old radio and setting it on the floor. I got this one back out the other day, and damned if the thing didn't break completely after two weeks...it just stopped loading the CD's all together. At first I had to lean it on its side to get them to play at all, and then it just decided to spin and spin and SPIN and never play. Not to mention the sound quality is poor, the bass is horrible even with the bass boost.The only good thing I can say is it does pick up radio stations pretty well. I would certainly not recommend this radio if you want to listen to CD's. And if you just want to listen to the radio...go buy a world band radio, it gets better reception."
3,"Poor sound, low volume",I bought this CD play thinking it would be ideal to take on vacations but found the sound quality to be poor and the volume low. In addition the CD mechanism is flimsy. (One good point -- the radio reception is excellent.)If you're looking for a lightweight travel solution I suggest a Walkman and travel speakers -- the Sony SRS-T77 Travel Speakers are quite good.
2,Clicking/Hissing Noise,"I just purchased this unit from a local retailer and was extremely disappointed with the CD playback. Immediately out of the box it was hissing and clicking when I put a CD in. I tried multiple CD's (both RW's and standard) and found no change in the clicking noise. This unit was purchased to play quiet music in an work office and the clicking certainly overwhelms the music at lower volumes. After reading the reviews here, I discovered that I am not the only one with this problem. Given the number of people that have mentioned this problem I would reccomend against purchasing this product."
2,Stylish but tinny music quality,"Bought for kitchen. Looks great, but sound is tinny. Plays my CDR/RWs fine. I don't have the hissing that other reviewers have mentioned. Hard to tune into what few radio stations I can get here.Wish I'd bought a bulky, but good sounding boombox."
3,Writing of Giovanni Papini,"The book provides an addition piece of literature by a well- liked author, Giovanni Papini. It is well worth reading for anyone interested in a more dimensional understanding of his writing style and ideas."
3,Lack of answers,Good book but the greatest fault with the book is its lack of anwsers to the end of chapter questions. If it did have anwsers this book will definetly be worth a five star rating
4,obscure yet brilliant,this is a brilliant compilation for bands that are really obscure from the factory days - yet all these tracks were played in more underground dance clubs globally yet hold up so well today - in fact i play them mixed with so many contemporary bands. Hard to find these original length tracks anywhere on CD. I recommend this album as well as Twice as Nice (the second compilation).Twice as Nice: Be Music/Dojo/Kamins/Baker Productions
5,The Best Season of 'The Golden Girls',"Season 4 of The Golden Girls is m favorite season. Here is what I thought of the episodes (4 stars is the highest)Yes, We Have No Havanas - **The Days and Night of Sophia Petrillo - ***The One thatGot Away - ***Yokel Hero - **Bang The Drum, Stanly - **Sophia's Wedding Parts 1 and 2 - ***Brother, Can You Spare That Jacket? - **Scared Straight - ***Stan Takes a Wife - **The Auction - ***Blind Date - ****The Importance of being Ernest - ***Love Me Tender - ***Valentines Day - **Two Rode Togeather - ****You Gotta Have Hope - ***Fiddler on the Ropes - **Til Death We Volley - ***High Anxiety - **Little Sister - ****Sophia's Choice - ***Rites of Spring - ****Foreign Exchange - **We're Outta Here Parts 1 and 2 - ****This DVD is worth every penny.

5,the best,the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best the best sitcom you will ever see
5,The Golden Girls,As funny and entertaining as all of the earlier seasons. The episodes with Sophia's wedding were great- she is a classic.
5,Love My Golden Girls,Another of the show's great seasons. This one completed my collection of the entire series. LOVE IT! Definitely worth it to own em all!
5,One Of The Best Seasons!!,If You Love The Golden Girls Like I Do Then This Season Is For You.. Don't Wait Puchase It Now!!
5,Pillow Shams,I was very pleased with the pillow shams. They are beautiful and the value can't be beat. I would highly recommend them.
4,A nice little afternoon read....,"A generally overlooked gem of a utopian novella that makes for a pleasant experience. The treatment is calmer and more down to earth than A Brave New World, and is more thoughtful and meditative than Looking Backward. Gilman's feminism celebrates motherhood above all, and embraces Christianity. In a time when we're reconsidering gender roles and marriage in society, Herland is particularly relevant and insightful.Highly recommended for the fan of utopian literature and early feminist thought."
2,Philips PET710,Philips PET710 can't handle aspect ratios of 2.35:1. With a 2.35:1 movie this dvd player distorts the movie stretching it so that everything in the movie looks short and fat.Other then the 2.35:1 aspect ratio bug it is a good dvd player.
5,Withstands abuse,"I bought this portable DVD player for my two sons (ages 4 and 1 ) for long car trips and plane rides, and I highly recommend this device for any parent who wishes to keep their sanity when traveling.The DVD controls are simple enough for my four-year-old to operate, the screen resolution is quite adequate when you consider the price, and the sound is of acceptable quality. You can hear the audio with no problems or distortion in a car, and the two audio jacks allow for two sets of earphones on a plane. Most importantly, this DVD player is able to withstand a lot of abuse - falls, spills, food, etc. And it keeps on working.The package comes with a car adaptor, which is useful for long car trips. However, if you're going to take a long flight you'll need more than one battery since the batter that comes with the product only lasts about 2 to 2 hours."
1,never worked,"Great deal, but it never played. Seller sent it without a power cord and had to purchase one for this particular type DVD player. It would have DVD inside and screen constantly read open. It did not know it was closed and DVD inside. Never got to see how it worked. Returned the item. Although on side of seller, they were very proactive, contacted me quickly and refunded me additional funds to return the item. I was very pleased with that but not with the product."
3,so-so,"This is the first portable DVD player that I own. First of all, it looks decent, with a shiny metal plated finish on the exterior. The screen, at 7"" is OK, but it's not the largest screen you can get for the money. Very portable, except for the exterior battery that portudes from the back. The plus to have this is, though it does make the player less compact when traveling, it tilts the bottom of the player slightly vertical, for easier access to the controls(like how keyboards are always slightly tilted). Picture quality is decent, sound is great.The speakers take up 1/3 of the screen area. There are two headphone jacks, but no AV IN for gaming and other things.Battery lasts about 2.5 hours, though I havn't tested it for myself. It comes with a lighweight, compact remote control. Overall, this is a pretty nice product minus the flaws."
4,good portable player,"I have been running from store to store trying out different players. I first bought an Insignia player (see my review) but had to return it and found this one on sale. Reading all the positive reviews in this section helped my decision. This is probably the only one player that has the fast forward/backward buttons on the unit and not on the remote only. The unit is well constructed and seems to be able to take some abuse. Many other units in this price range (I bought this for $150) seem to be made of plastic. Please read the other reviews for the good things other have said about this unit. I just have 2 little complaints which avoid me giving this unit a 5 star. Firstly, the unit is VERY NOISY when playing a disc. At some point, it even emits a high pitch hum. Secondly, the picutre is very bright. If you are watching it in a dark room, the picture is glaring even if you turn the brightness to the lowest level."
1,I will never buy one agian,"I have had nothing but problems out of mine. first off, the screen went out due to a factory defect only 3 months after buying, got it fixed, and went out agian. I just took the piece of junk nad threw it away. I wouldnt waist my time with it."
3,screen works off and on,I bought this product in March. The battery pack is indeed strange and large. The screen has stopped working after 3.5 months. It didnt work last night but worked this morning. I contacted WorldWide distrubtors and was told to call phillips directly because they do not have any of this product left.My irritations begin!
3,"Good image, bit clumsy with battery","I really like the screen, very crisp and bright. It's also good that you can consult online resources to unblock it for compatibility with other regions. Am less in love with the way it looks and feels when the battery is attached, it's sticking out as if it's not fully attached (but it is!). Also, was disappointed by the AC adapter, which only accepts 110v (how could they not think of including a double voltage adapter for a portable device?? If you don't mind these two inconveniences then it's a good buy!"
1,Players are non-repairable and non-servicable,If you have problems with your player you will not get help from phillips. The customer support I got informed me that the players are not servicable and not repairable. Did not see that information while purchasing product. The support is set up where you only get an option to type chat with an associate which is a clue to the service you will get. Hope you do not find out as I did.
