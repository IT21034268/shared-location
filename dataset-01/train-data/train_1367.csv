5,"GOOD PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY!","No problems with this item. Quick delivery, good price, good item - happy owner!"
4,Ge Jasho97929 Xd/Smart Media Card Reader,Ge Jasho97929 Xd/Smart Media Card Readeris a great product built particularly for the users of SmartMedia Cards and xd Cards. Most of the Card Readers does not have slots for SmartMedia Cards and xd Cards. Ge Jasho97929 Xd/Smart Media Card Reader is the right Media Card Reader for that purpose. I bought it to use mostly with some of my Music Keyboards that has Smart Media Card slot.It was a fast delivery as I expected. Buying products from Amazon.com has always been a good experience to me.
1,Ordered puffed millet-received puffed rice--,"I had serched for puffed millet for some recipes I had. Order from you. Received puffed rice--which I have no use for. I never returned it-just gave it to the food bank. Called Arrowhead that actually sent it, could never get through. Just gave up."
2,FALSE ADVERTISING,"OH YES, this is puffed rice all right. BUT ITS BROWN RICE, not WHITE RICE PUFFED.and they don't tell you that up front.sorry, brown rice puffed, doesn't cut it for taste.there is nothing like white rice puffed rice for taste..now if they would make a frosted white puffed rice, it would sell."
5,Arrowhead Mills Brown Rice Cereal,"If you cant find the Alf's brand brown rice cereal at Wally World like I cant, try this cereal. Its about 2.00 a bag, if you include the shipping, but for a non-sweetened cereal and fat free snack food this is pretty good. Not fancy, no marshmallows, gummy bears or crap in it. Just puffed brown rice."
5,Puffed Rice,My husband enjoys puffed rice cereal...We bought this thinking it would be to much but we are ready for another case...The product and the company were both great....
4,good whole cereal,"I am a health nut, so I don't care much about sugary tastes anymore and my palate has morphed to like a wholesome taste over time. I mix this puffed rice with some Chocolate Caramel Mocha whey protein powder and a little water and it tastes like Smacks...I love it!!! This cereal is exactly what it says it is - whole grain brown rice that's puffed (think Rice Krispies or Smacks) without any added salt, sugar or other ingredients. If you are looking for a food that can replace sugary cereals, this is it. If you are used to ""normal"" sugary cereals, you will not like this product."
5,great cereal,"Puffed rice with fresh fruit - great healthy breakfast. Low Calorie, no sugar, no added salt. Also good in trail mix."
2,"Running in ""Packs""","Let's get into the doghouse, your story may come from trial transripts but where's the rest of the story......you see, I'm the sister of a character in your book. Where are the other fleas bags you forget to mention?"
1,Guardian ANgel doesn't CUT it,"I received the picture of the Guardian Angel on the 25 of January. I am VERY disappointed with it. It is not the WHOLE picture . The bottom part of the picture is not there.I have contacted the seller,and it is not resolved yet."
4,If you like Yngwie Malmsteen . .,"you will like Chris Impellitteri. Impellitteri is Yngwie neo-classical combined with Blackmore-ish gothic. The guitar work is impressive. ""Secret Lover"" is one of the finest, rythmic lead guitar solos I've heard - it takes up the entire second half of the track and has to be cranked up. ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" will freak you out at first but eventually you'll settle down. Secret Lover, Stand in Line, and Tonight I Fly must be heard."
4,Graham bonnet rules.,"What can i say about this great hard rock rainbow like album?Graham bonnet create with his voice, fantasy and mysteriousimages in the mind of the audience.The only bad in this album is the two unnecessary instrumentals""over the rainbow"" and ""playing with fire"".Chris impellitterialmost destroy with this two useless instrumentals that great album.All the other songs are just hard rock masterpieces.Four stars for a great hard rock album."
2,How NOT to make an album,"I recently purchased ""Stand in Line"" solely based on Mr. Impellitteri's reputation as a speedy guitarist. Unfortunately, the bulk of his solo playing is buried due to poor mixing. What I can hear sounds fast, but very mechanical and uninspired.As with most shredders, comparisons to Yngwie are unavoidable. However, I hear more similarity in the songwriting than the soloing. The song structures, chord voicings, and even instrument tones are so Malmsteen-esque it's not funny.By far, the biggest disappointment to me was the inclusion of a 5+ minute cover of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" right in the middle of the album. While his interpretation of the classic tune was mildly interesting, it certainly didn't fit with the other material. I could see using it as a hidden track at the end, but that's about it. Why he chose to stick it smack dab in the middle is beyond me.If you're into shred-style guitar, I honestly feel you could do much better than ""Stand in Line."" Sorry Chris."
5,"Great deal, awesome scent!","Love Alfred sung- and got an amazing deal on this large size bottle. Item arrived very quickly as well, and In nice packaging"
1,Possible Old Product,I'm a fan of Alfred Sung's fragrances and recently decided to try Forever. Do believe this was possibly old product as it had very little fragrance. Was disappointed.
1,too sweet,This perfume smells too sweet but it's just my preference but the Shi smells fresh n nice......a more mature scent
1,What a Fallacy!!!,"Having lived in southern West Virginia for nearly 50 years, I find this work to be insulting to the people of southern West Virginia. The Lights must have looked long and hard to find places with the appalling conditions that have been depicted in this book. Granted, the economy of West Virginia is not stellar, but the majority of its citizens and its communities are not represented in this book. Yes, this state has been shaped by its coal heritage, but it has not been destroyed by it. Southern West Virginia still struggles, but not to the extent implied in these photographs. Those seeking a more accurate portrayal of life in coal communities should look elsewhere, or, better yet, visit and see for themselves."
4,"The Beginning, The Champions[Region 2]","I, it's excused, like Stuart Damon, Alexandra Bstedo, the theme what turns me on?My television, David's,"
5,Great saw,"I reviewed jet,grizzley,general,delta unisaw,laguna, and several other taiwan made saws. The powermatic was the winner. You can't go wrong with the 5 hp motor, fine machined table, steel machined crank locking knobs, bigger crank handles, rock solid fence. The saw came with a QA label showing arbor runnout, etc. I set it up in about 4 hrs and ran a machinist straight edge over the table. The saw measured out at .002 flatness, pretty good. You will need to buy a 10 ga wire, plug, etc to hook it up. The manual was clearly written. The saw has not been slowed down while cutting everything from ripping old hard oak to maple. Great piece of equipment. The only concern was the PM 66 had always used a 3VX belt to drive the pulleys and Amazon even advertised as such. However, when I received my saw it only has 2 belts and pulleys. This was very misleading in my view. Overall - good saw, but have had the saw for over a year and Amazon is still advertising the 3VX belt."
3,POWERMATIC 66 LESS THAN EXPECTED,"OK NOT MUCH ON REVIEWS BUT HERE GOES.I BOUGHT TWO SAWS AT THE SAME TIME,ONE WAS FINE SMALL ADJUSTMENTS AND A VERY GOOD SAW.THE OTHER SAW WAS THE PITS!!! COULD NOT EVEN MOUNT THE BLADE WITHOUT TAKING THE SAW APART AND READJUSTING EVERYTHING,AND I MEAN EVERYTHING.THE WELDED IN ANGLE THAT THE TILT MOUNTS TO WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE BY 1/4 "" TALKING TO POWERMATIC WAS FINE THEY GAVE A LOT OF HELP AND SUPPORT BUT FEEL THAT THERE QC DEPARTMENT SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER THEY MUST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP THE DAY THIS SAW WAS MADE.I GAVE A 3 STAR RATEING BECAUSE ONE SAW WAS FINE AND THE OTHER ONE WAS BAD.NOTE: IF I HAD TO DO THE ADJUSTMENTS WITH OUT LOOKING AT THE OTHER SAW TO SEE HOW IT SHOULD GO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT HARDER."
4,Entertaining and Breezy,"Although I would take issue with the author's contention that this collection of quotes is devoid of filler, it is easily the most entertaining and original collection that I have ever read. I had heard perhaps only a quarter of the hundreds of quotes provided, a very good ratio! All in all, if you want a good, quick, hilarious read - this one is a sure thing. Even the ones you've heard before are worth hearing again."
4,wit,I bought this book because I love dark humor. It has nice quotations about the beautiful world of sarcasm.Great book for those would seek beyond conventional humor. It's like putting nasty tabasco sauce into your reading.
4,JJ REALLY DOESN'T STEP OUT ENOUGH,"I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT THE ONE THING THAT DREW ME TO JOE JACKSON WAS HIS DIVERESITY IN MUSICAL STYLES AND HIS WILLINGNESS TO WRITE AND PREFORM MUSIC WITHOUT A WHIT ABOUT HIS AUDIENCE AND HIS RECORD LABEL. HE WAS THE MAN! WITH ""NIGHT & DAY II"" THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH NEW GROUND EXPLORED MUSICALLY...BUT HEY AS I SAY TO OTHER DEVOTED JJ'ERS, A LESS THAN STELLAR JOE JACKSON ALBUM IS 99% BETTER THAN ANYTHING YOU ARE HEARING TODAY. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO IS TIRED OF FORMULATIC CORPORATE BLAH THAT YOU HEAR ON RADIO TODAY. JOE WILL NEVER BE MY NUMBER TWO!"
4,A brilliant non-remake,"This record is brilliant! At first I was a bit afraid that this record would be a re-make of Night and Day (of course a brilliant album, but hey, a good artist doesn't copy an old hit, he makes a new one!), but only the theme, NY, is common, but this album grabs the city as it is now. I especially love the strings, which have great dialogues. There is one thing about the album: Joe shifted slowly back to the pop, while his experiments with classical and jazz music were showing more creativity."
2,Disappointing effort,"Like many Joe Jackson fans, I considered Night and Day to be among the artist's finest works and so, I bought this CD with high expectations. I am disappointed to report that my expectations were not met as this work, while good, simply does not capture the heart and soul like the first CD. It is a good album but not a great one.I did manage to see Mr. Jackson live on his last tour and he performed about half of this CD. It is much better live than on the CD but still fell a bit short.Skip this one and go out and buy Live in NYC instead."
1,He Can Do Much Better Than This...,"This supposed ""sequel"" to his spectacular hit LP ""Night and Day"" (early '80s) lacks all the warmth and humor that made that earlier record such a success.Here, Jackson employes latin drum beats and urbane lyricism, similar at times to the style found on Night and Day. But this new album has a cold, calculated, brittle feeling to it. There is absolutely nothing here that can match the sleek ambience of ""Steppin' Out"" (from Night and Day) for example...I was very disappointed with this CD overall... fans of Joe Jackson should seek out the new Live In New York instead(energetic performances of many of his classics, plus a few surprises).Those who are interested in a good starting point for Joe Jackson should try the Hits collection, which has been re-mastered and contains 17 of the best songs from his career.But avoid this one (Night and Day II) at all costs... it's tired and wearisome and boring and simply does not represent this artist at his best."
3,"My lips refused to ""Wow""","""Wow!! who is that guy?! what a talent!"", i shouted 18 years ago, when JJs ""NaD"" was played on my old gramophone.Since that ""Wow"", i follow JJ, buy most of his CDs and enjoy the most (only ""Body and soul"" is not played very often by me). ""Night and day 2"" reminds you the ""original"" from 1982 plus the strings section. It's a good one, but it does not stand my high expectations from JJ. Till now, JJ had always surprised me with something new, but this time he returns 18 years ago, and i can't ""Wow"" to that."
4,makes you think.,"I had to listen to this album a couple of times before it started to grow on me. This is usually the case with me and JJ's albums. Then I get to know them better and start to really like them. There are some really great songs on this album. Some I don't really care for, but hey! Take the good with the ugly right? One thing that I really like about Joe Jackson is that he never does the same thing all the time. Night and Day II is strange and beautiful indeed."
4,Professional yet emotional,"I'll just say that if you're remotely familiar with Joe Jackson you should have this album... Disregard the extreme fans who seem to be disappointed; this is a solid pop/rock album that will satisfy the most demanding ears. ""Stranger Than You"" is a reason enough to listen to this CD."
5,NIGHT AND DAY II,"I am a big Joe Jackson fan, but I did NOT give this work a fair airing when I first heard it. Recently, listening to 2 RAINY NIGHTS (featuring songs from N&D; II ) I decided to listen to the original album (yes, I'm a geezer) and am on my third listen today.My original assessment was very, very wrong. As always with Mr. Jackson, he never stays anywhere too long. You KNOW it's his music (just as with The Beatles) but it's NOT the same. I would disagree with those who think so; please listen again and again, as I have, and I think you'll begin to really hear THE MUSIC that's there waiting for you. Thank you for your time."
2,"Why Joe, why!?","Ouch- this album was a big disappointment to me! I'm a huge Joe Jackson fan (I think I have all his studio albums just about), but this one just goes nowhere fast! Pretentious operatic swells, contrived lyrics, instrumentation more at place on a Lite Rock station. It's really a big surprise for me- esp. since his ""Live in NY"" album he put out earlier that year is absolutely AMAZING! Joe and two other guys on stage, the essence of a live rock/jazz trio, and all the power and brilliance you come to expect from The Man! Oh well----every artist has to go off a navel-gazing tangent some time. Night and Day II was Jackson's turn to do so."
1,Every genius has a bad day,"I'm a huge JJ fan and can recommend many other JJ albums over this dud. I consider him to be a really gifted artist.There is one song, however, called Love Got Lost which is vintage Joe and is something you may want to buy by itself on Napster.Everything else is way below the quality of songwriting you'd expect from an artist of this caliber. This is one of his only albums where he has songs such as Dear Mom which is embarrassingly bad."
3,Night and Day follow-up a little bit of a downer,"As a long time fan of Joe Jackson, having seen him record the Big World album, I was excited by a prospect of a follow-up to Night and Day. I had hoped that he would stay away from some of the symphonic meanderings which plauged Heaven and Hell. What he has crafted is somewhat of a compromise. The music is entirely piano, bass and violin driven whith some superior arrangements. However, the overall tone of the album is depressing. There's only one or two ""catchy"" tunes on the disk. It's more of a song cycle which is interconnected. He keeps teasing us with some of the melodies of Night and Day but its just a tease, he never delivers. Joe Jackson is a brilliant musician and a perfectionist. He just could use a little more commercial sensibility. Who wants to listen to depressing music all the time. Overall, however, I still think is work is better then 90% of the stuff out there today and would recommend this as a must for any Jackson fan."
5,Stunning!,"I got my copy today... and roared through the pages and images... Beautiful and fascinating images of Malibu's past... Paradise Cove in 1890, the Malibu Ranch, The Adamson House. So many interesting stories and images... and lives! And... some great surf shots too. This is a perfect blend of the many lifestyles here in Malibu... all in one book. Educational and informative and with some good humor too. I know what I'm giving for Christmas presents now!"
3,"Nice, but not nice enough","The photography was excellent and commentary was okay. Very few detail images, no floor plans and few, if any, construction details. I'm interested in the details and how to replicate features or at least the materials used....but nothing in this book to help much. There was absolutely no street addresses of the houses mentioned, other architect books do---why not here??? The author did manage to keep very good track of the years of birth and death of the people involved."
5,GOT IT GOING ON CD,"THIS IS THE BEST CD I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. EXCELLENT, NOT JUST ONE SONG BUT ALL OF THEM. MY FAVORITE IS ANYTIME MAN THAT'S THE KIND I'M LOOKING FOR....LOL"
3,Hole,"I think UK shopkeepers should sort themselves out. I couldn't find this EP at all in England and had to order it from here, but at a mere $4, I'm not complaining. True, you can get all but one of these tracks on My Body the Hand Grenade (excellent) but the booklet has an enlightening interview and some great original flyers for early Hole gigs. How did Courtney ever let them use that picture of her on the front though, particularly given her new glam makeover? Retard Girl and Turpentine are my favourites. The lyrics are Hole at their best."
1,WORST CD HOLE EVER DID,"SURE, THIS CD IS GOOD FOR ITS PRICE, BEING THAT THERE IS A BIG BOOKLET, BUT ALL 4 OF THESE SONGS SUCK! NOW, I'M A FAN OF HOLE, BUT WHAT THE HELL IS THIS STUFF? THIS STUFF CAN'T EVEN MATCH THE STUFF THEY DID LATER ON IN THEIR CAREER. A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT. MAYBE SOME FANS OF 80S STYLE PUNK WOULD LOVE THIS."
2,Interesting in a way....but not very good.....,"This EP is extremely raw and unpolished...ALL the songs are repetitive,sloppy and dark. Hole would go onto display much greater music and this is really just the band in their beggining days, which makes it an interesting listen for a hole fan. There is creativity here, you can see the hole blueprint..the ideas are forming,but the band is still trying to come up with the music part(which can be described as a dark, brooding mess of grunge-punk, with disturbing, but not entirely bad lyrics) I would recomend for hole fans to pick this up to hear the band in their earliest incarnation...just dont expect to hear great music...step back into 1990 with the monster that was courtney and hole!"
5,goody,"this is a good cd,all of the 4 songs are on MY BODY THE HAND GRENADE,except for ONE,which really isnt a song,just some talking by courtney...very cool though.ALSO! Hole was more punk before Kurt came along? what does that mean?someone wrote that but i dont understand....kurt of course influenced courtney on LTT,and probably helped her on some of the songs,but Nirvana wasnt non-punk ya know?I think LTT is more grunge-punk then any Nirvana cd.Who knows,all i know is ,Kurt didnt write the whole album of LTT,and Billy didnt write all of CS,this album is cool,but not the best of Hole.Hole's new song BE A MAN was written soley by Hole and HOLE only,and its my favorite hole song to date,it will be on the ANY GIVEN SUNDAY soundtrack out Jan 4 2000 so go and buy it...."
4,Meet a new band: Hole,"It is really interesting to check out this single if you are a BIG Hole fan like me. You can notice how was the band in the begining and what were their influences. Retard Girl is cool, but the best song is Turpentine, an unreleased song. The booklet is also very good and it brings a Hole interview in 1990 where the band tells more about what they would expect in the future. If you are a fan, a Must-Buy!"
5,worked like a charm,"Easy fix for my inoperative pump. The old brushes looked OK, but were the problem. Bonus was the extra brushes contained in the kit."
4,buy,the kit has a variety of brushes that fit multiple models. i found a pair in the kit i could use. i was satisfied.
5,Beautiful,"This is a nice collection of songs with strong Native American sounds fused with jazzy New Age sounds. Being Native American myself this album is paradise to listen to. It is nowhere near as powerful as lets say Robbie Robertsons 'Music For The Native Americans' and 'Contact From The underworld Of Redboy' but this ablum is pleasant to listen to.The Crane, Answer Mother Earth, Tsali, and To All My Relations are my favorites.This CD is a hidden gem. Go and check this one out."
1,CAUTION! This bear caused 2nd & 3rd degree burn on my child,"My daughter who is 5, held the bear up to a light too long and it fell on her leg and caused a severe burn! I am aware my daughter over charged the bear, but they are intended for children this age and I am sure that my daughter will not be the last one to do this. I did contact the company that manufatured it, and I had to send pics and the bear, BUT he told me flat out that they would not be re-called :( They did send toys for her and her 3 siblins as a peace offering BUT that does not dismiss that it can cause a severe burn!!! [...]"
5,"Eisley 'Room Noises""",Absolutely excellent! Highly recommend to any one who love pure music and vocals. A+
4,I always end up brightly wound...,"when I listen to this album. I tend to stray away from their sad songs to stay that way.My favorites are the dixie-influenced ""Golly Sandra,"" the melancholy-but-fun-to-sing ""One Day I Slowly Floated Away"", the closing track ""Trollywood"" and the happy ""Brightly Wound.""Eisley's music is very simplistic and the melodies are catchy. If you just want good music, then I truly recommend this band."
4,Impressive for being so young!,"Great band, especially considering nearly everyone of them (including the lyricist) is a teenager. I actually just rec'ed both Eisley's new album and their DC concert on the <A HREF=""http://www.musiccherry.com"" TARGET=""_blank"">Music Cherry blog</A>I hope they get bigger, but in a non-hectic way b/c they seem really nice. and it's not often you find such great new music."
5,A hauntingly beautiful ode to youth,"Room Noises, the debut album from Texas alternative pop act Eisley, is absolutely enchanting. The whimsical lyrics, the haunting melodies, and the emotional harmonies from the siblings just make the album so worthwhile, so satisfying. It's the type of album a heartbroken teenager would put on repeat to soothe her aching soul. Definitely pick this album up, and head over to to the official website, Eisley.com, to get more information about the band. Their story is phenomenal---Eisley started performing when Stacy, the lead singer/keyboardist was only eight years old! Pretty interesting stuff. They're on tour with New Found Glory right now, but I predict this band will be all over the place in the next year."
3,Captivating yet shallow,"I bought Room Noises knowing next to nothing about the band, on a whim. I was immediatly captivated by ""Memories"" which, in my opinion, is the best song on the entire album. The Depree sisters' voices are unique and beautiful. Throughout the entire album their duets and tri-ets are lovely and comforting. At first the lyrics seem very interesting and epic (like on Memories), but after awhile you kind of see that most of them aren't really about anything. So, this isn't exactly stimulating music, and it works against the album a little, as there's not enough emotion too it, because of that. Good album, though."
4,Good bible handbook for Christians.,"This bible handbook is very detailed using archaeological research and historical facts. It also highlights different debates that theologians have about various subjects in the bible. However, if you are looking for an entirely objective, non-religious fact book, you may be disappointed. This book is entirely from a Christian point of view. It also takes the traditional view as the bible being entirely infallable and written by the hand of God. If you have issues with that view, this may not be the books you want. Otherwise, it is completely useful for bible study and teaching."
1,BUYER BEWARE...,"Billy Graham bought the rights to this book and removed the information about the Jesuits, the counter-reformation, the inquisition and the people who have been murdered buy the Catholic church! Also the New International Version of the Bible is corrupt--its best to stick with the King James Version!"
4,Good one,I bought this item for someone else. The binding is good and the book looks so new.. Product is as said.
5,Excellent Buy,"Having already read an earlier version of this publication in my church library, it was already familiar. The newest version is, of course, more comprehensive, an excellent companion for Bible Study and general information regarding the periods and the locales. One of the best buys yet."
1,Very Poorly Done DVD,"This DVD attempts to cover way too much in too little time. Explaing 7 card stud, Caribbean stud, Texas Hold'em and Omaha in about 25 minutes. No strategy or technique at all. It is less than a beginner level DVD. Camera is often too far away to see the cards on the table. You can find any of the information from this DVD doing a quick internet search on the games AND a lot more. Definitely pass on this one, really disappointed when I got it."
5,takes the tropicalia biscuit...,"and then stuffs it in its mouth and has its biscuit, and eats it too. If you're at all interested in interesting music, this disc will interest you, with interest!Other tropicalia tomfooolery often leaves me a bit cold, or is too self-consciously wacky for its own good (i like Veloso's second album though). Ze's experimentation, for me, always seems unforced, organic by comparison. Biscuit-wise, whereas some other artists' experimentation is slapped on like chocolate icing on top of a pre-existing biscuit, Ze's more a chocolate-chip-forming-an-intrinsic-part-of-the-biscuit man, melting into and proving indistinguishable from the soft, fleshy dough.I'm taking biscuits as cookies here you losers, not those grim southern breakfast spods.Think of this record as bossa nova by a mellowed out frank zappa or something. Really lovely acoustic psychadelia, like Incredible String Band from Brazil. You heard."
3,OK BUT JUST AVERAGE,"provides a literal transcription of the music; which is fine for an accomplished musician but for the amateur it is tough - i prefer a simplified approach even if it isn't ""exact""; for example noting the fret cappoed and the simplifed chords bob probably used himself and an indication of chord changes for ALL the lyrics (i know that's asking much!) better bets are ""the songs of bob dylan"" (a truly wonderful book which has chord changes even over the ""additional lyrics"") or ""bob dylan the 6 chord songbook""."
5,This song rules! We play it at Abercrombie and Fitch...,"I work at Abercrombie and Fitch and the song is on the CD we play during store hours. I love ""Last Night a DJ Saved My Life."" It just makes you want to disco-dance! It's got a great beat."
3,good series but...,"Continuing where Roots left off, Next generation is another look into the moving family drama that is the true life story of Alex's family. the series was riveting and I would recommend that anyone who owns Roots buy this as a continuation to that narrative. The only negative factor is the last dvd was warped, making me have to return the set. If not for that I would have given this a five."
1,A disposable hibachi,"Essentially a one-season, lightweight, hibachi that doesn't stand up to extended use.So, at $12 it's too expensive but may be worth about $5."
1,Junk,"This is a low grade, made in China, sheet metal, flimsy piece of junk. If you want a one-use and throw it away grill for the beach or lake, this might be it. Otherwise, get the cast iron Hibachi."
1,don't even think about it,"the ""steel"" in the product is so thin you could read a newspaper thru it.seriously it is just a piece of junk."
3,CHINA JUNK,"a bit of Chinese junk to be sure and certainly not worth the $29plus total that it cost me for the bloody thing!!!! To make matters worse it came with the wrong grill grid holders, which did not fit at all. I called Kay Home Products in order to obtain the proper holders and after quite a verbal hassle the person agreed to send me the correct holders. Guess what! Oy veyh! They sent me totally wrong holders. Instead of throwing the thing away I am going to use it as a bonsai planter. GFH"
4,Excellent on Toms; Ok on Snare.,"These Toms sound great, they tune great and they are of excellent quality and very durable. The Snare however isnt the greatest Remo snare drum i have tried. If could do this order over (and i will have that chance in the near future) i would pick these heads for my toms, and pick a different head for the snare drum seperatly."
5,Great Heads!,"These heads are hands down the way to go when you are redoing your worn out heads. My son got these for Christmas and easily set them up on his drums, he has been jamming ever since! These heads are quailty, and a great price."
3,"Mesopotamia: B-52's peak, badly remixed","I agree with Paul McGrath: Mesopotamia is The B-52's at their peak. Mesopotamia on vinyl propels me uncontrollably out of my chair to dance. Kate Pierson's unchecked exhuberance is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Gawd they're having a blast, and it's perfectly off-centered and beat-underlayed in production by David Byrne. This was a meeting of artists in their prime, an unrepeatable moment.I don't know *what* Tom Durack was thinking when he desiccated this dripping-wet masterpiece in a 1990 remix that saps it almost completely of its original fulgent energy. Dammit man, I don't need to hear every word of the lyrics!I'll use this as a vinyl-preserver, playing it when I'm doing dishes or in the car. But life's too short -- when I wanna jump, I'm going with the version I need to turn over in the middle."
2,Unpromising,"I bought the book in the time period where it would be shipped within the week but instead basically came 3 weeks later. I was really upset with the false advertisement for example "" if you buy this within the hour it will be shipped to you between 3 days."" I'm upset because of the strain it put on my studies in regards to this book."
4,My Anrtonia... Pretty good,i think that my antonia is a fairly good book but it just taes time to get into it. i like it.
3,"Nice idea, just didn't go anywhere","I liked the idea of this novel, the characters and everything, but it was a dull read. I kept expecting there to be some sort of plot or climax but there wasn't any (that i could tell)! I needed a book for school and chose this, but there are definitely better reads out there."
3,Good book for older readers,"I read My Antonia as a assignment for 9th grade Literature. I did not enjoy, along with many of my classmates. For one thing the setting is in the 1800's and the book moves a little slowly. I think that if I would have read it when I was older I maybe would have appreciated it more."
1,Review of My Antonia,It was okay not my type of book. People who like history because it teaches you about the olden days.
4,My Antonia,"My Antonia is a book that is written in a rather quiet, not overly exciting manner while avoiding the extreme dullness that many books of this type (sappy love stories) display. This great novel is based on one boy/man (Jim) and his thoughts and memories that revolve around ""his"" Antonia. Antonia is a hard working farm-girl who is friends with Jim, and they always seem to find each other after one or the other moves along, either by choice or by situation. Taking place mostly in the still undeveloped western expanse of yesteryear, much attention is given to the lives and hardships of farmers and immigrants alike. Despite all of the hard times that the characters go through, they always manage to stick together and/or find each other and be able to reminisce about previous times with each other. This is a well-written book that has the ability to find the heart in anyone, no matter what their testosterone level!"
3,It's okay,"This book was a bit long for me. Well written, but rather than being a story, it was more like a biography, yet it did hold my interest."
4,My Antonia,Very good reading - it is an old classic - which is my type of reading - I am so glad that Kindle has so many classics for free and I can read and enjoy all of them.
2,Eh,"Immigrant life on the American Prairie...That is enough to keep me from being interested. On another note, do not buy this version of the book, they completely omitted Cather's woodcuttings that were intended to go along with the book."
4,Complex Character Portrait,"The introduction of My Antonio is contrived. For another thing, because My Antonio is often about everyone but Jim, for awhile I wasn't sure who I should care about. Moreover,Cather's style initially felt like descriptive treatises. Eventually though, Cather reeled me in with her complex portrait of the folks of Black Hawk. Not only does each different culture have its share of drunks, partiers, rapists, murderers, and, oh, also good people, but their expertly intertwined. These lines written by Jim about the weather accurately summarize the feel of My Antonio: ""This is reality, whether you like it or not. All those frivolities of summer, the light and the shadow, the living mask of green that trembled over everything, they were lies. This is what was underneath. This is the truth."" In focusing on aspects other than traditional frontier life, Cather introduces readers to a different but just as real type of Western life."
4,"""A coming of age story in the 'Pure American heartland'""","Pure American heartland, this story of immigrants settling the great prairie is a staple of 20th century American literature. A coming of age story with the requisite violence that followed the great migration, the novel, is the story of young Antonia as seen through the eyes of her childhood friend, Jim Burden. Plenty there that anyone can relate to, from themes of romance, social integration and American myth-making. If you are going to read Cather, this is the place to start: both she and the critics generally agree that it is the pinnacle of her body of work."
1,A Boring off-topic book.,"First of all, the book Is about a boy named jim and a girl named Antonia. Short and simple, its off topic, barelly mentions antonia, and describes the same details over and over and over makeing it long and repetitive. If you like romance novels, you might like it, but just to let you know, the only reason i even picked up the book was for a school class."
4,Classic,"Great writing which makes this book a classic however, the outcome of Antonia's life was a disappointment a bit of historical caste. Downeast Gal"
5,Incredible read,"I don't think I've read a more beautiful book. When Cather describes winter, you shiver! Aside from the story, the author's vivid prose brings the prairie to life."
3,Good book,"Interesting read. I read it for my book club and we had a good discussion. However, it is not typically the type of book I would pick for myself. I love kindle!"
1,...,"This book is the worst piece of ""literature"" that I have ever had the misfortune of turning my nose up to. I fell asleep, 2 pages into the book. The next time, I managed a 3 page chapter, and fell asleep again. It took me several tries to read, and everytime I read this book, I felt a feeling of incredible tiredness and depression settle upon me. I hated every page of this book, and think that any good reviews given to it came from the worst lying scum to ever deface this planet we call Earth. I suggest not buying it. It isn't even worthy of the 1 star that I gave it."
1,Only read it if you have to for school!,Required reading for my kids their junior year. My kids love to read everything they can get their hands on. This was pure torture! Had to look up summaries online to help get the ideas flowing on what to write about after reading this. Books like this are enough to make kids not want to read any more!
1,THE WORST book I have ever read,This book has got to be the worst book ever writen. It is so slow and boring that i could hardly stay awake while reading it. It was on a required reading list for school so i had to read it but if I had my choice about reading it I would not have read past the second page. The only reason i am giving this book a rating of one star is because they don't a zero star rating. This book was horrible and a waste of paper and money. Don't spend your money on this book buy another one worth reading.
2,new paperback of My Antonia by Willa Cather,"My book was supposed to be new -- a purchase straight from the amazonstore. However, my copy looked used: It's front and back covers were badly creased. I would've expected this from a book that was in good but used condition. If I had known that amazon would send me a new book in such condition, I would definitely have ordered a USED copy and PAID FAR LESS for it. I feel tricked and cheated. Beware buyers! As long as amazon has your money they don't care if a customer gets what s/he paid for or not."
2,They banned Catcher but not this?,"I consider myself a thoughtful and well read person and I happen to be a fan of many great classics...but this was ridiculous. I had to read this for my Advanced Placement English class, and I found it more dull than Chaucer (and that is being nice). People criticize Hemingway for being overly masculine, but this piece is overly feminine. This novel, in fact, was the first book I actually dreaded reading for school. My suggestion, only buy this book if you are interested in reading 200+ pages of pure mush."
2,This book needed a more captivating plot,"Though the narrator shared wonderful memories of his childhood to express the happiest times of his life, this book lacked a significant plot. Instead, it seemed to be just a bunch of old recollections thrown together. By the middle of the book, the story was already monotonous. I felt I had to push myself to read on, and if I wasn't assigned to read this book for a class, I don't think I would have continued with it at all."
3,"Vivid descriptions, but lacks storyline!","'My Antonia' by Willa Cather captures the reader with her wonderful writing but loses your interest once you realize there is no complex plot. Cather's descriptions give the reader a deep inside look into the fundamentals that form her characters. The book revolves around the narrator, Jim, and his love for Antonia, a Bohemian girl. The story is set in the plains of Nebraska where there is ""nothing but land."" The reader follows Jim's transformation to adulthood with his surprisingly indepth observations. Jim makes a promise to Antonia that he will return for her. To discover what happens, read 'My Antonia' and decide for yourself if this book is a tribute to classic literature."
3,Worth Your Time,"In the book My Antonia, Jim Burden gives an account of his life as he grows up in the prairies of Nebraska. You follow him through his friendship with his Bohemian friend named Antonia who he cares for dearly. As they both move forward in life the friends are forced to go their separate ways. But somehow they always keep a strange connection.I feel that My Antonia is a very well written book. Though it is not my favorite novel, I am glad that I read it. If you enjoy love stories or stories set in the pioneer times, this will be a good book for you. There is a great amount of detail about the hardships the people of this time had to deal with, making it very interesting. You also see a conection between people on a different level."
4,Engaging and Poignant,"Upon completion I find it difficult to understand how so many readers feel this novel to be sparse in plot and storyline. Frequently, My Antonia is praised for its sweeping descriptions and grand landscape and these are truly as remarkable as innumerable critics and readers have claimed. However, the story also has a delightful pace and races (almost too quickly) from one portion of Jim Burden's life to another. While the tone of the narrative is indeed nostalgic, Cather is not overly sentimental. The emotions of the past are exposed, but they are not languished in. Each is credited with its unique contribution to Jim and Antonia's characters, but all are considered with no more than the limited significance due to each of life's ephemeral moments. My Antonia is a wonderful coming of age story for the narrator, the nation, and the reader."
3,My Antonia by: Willa Cather,"The book My Antonia by Willa Cather is a very slow moving book but the plot makes up for it. It takes a very long time for any action or plot changes to accure. Though the character's personalities were very strong, they had little to build on. The infatuation between Jim and Antonia keeps the book moving and makes you wonder what the result will be. The suicide of Mr. Shimerda and not knowing whether it actually was a suicide hooks you early on. His death begins the attachment to the characters which lasts throughout the entire book. It makes Antonia an easy character to relate to because everyone has lost a loved one. Though the action was dull for the most part, the layered personalities makes this book, overall, worthwhile."
2,Bits are missing,"I looked forward to reading this classic, but was disappointed to finds great gaps in the text. There is no point in getting a book where you are happily reading along and all of a sudden find six or seven pages missing. This occurs more than once. Avoid this version, please."
2,What's the big deal?,"I'll start by saying I gave this book 2 stars because I would have felt awkward giving it one when so many people apparently think it is great. Those people aside, it deserves a one star rating, in my opinion. My chief complaint is that it is a formulaic and downright boring period piece. The love between the well-off American and the dirt poor foreign girl is a good example of uninspired writing. I found the characters stereotypical, the setting done to death and the plot (and I only use that word because I don't know what else to call it) simply doesn't go anywhere. But it's not all bad, at least Wick Cutter was interesting. In closing I would like to qualify this review by saying that I read a lot of books and there are only about two that I don't like and wouldn't recommend. It doesn't take much to please me; an interesting story, a fun character, a different style, all it takes is one redeeming feature for me to consider a book worthwhile. I find My Antonia a waste of time."
2,"This was a good book, but it had no plot!","Sorry, but I don't think this book deserves it's place as an ""American classic."" It is good, but not fabulous. It's strong point would be it's descriptions of nature, but the characters were disappointing. The end is a bit of a letdown as well."
2,My Antonia lacked a griping story and plot,"I had to read this book for a school term paper (Women In Amreican Literature), and I found it to be rather boring. Of course, it could be because I had to compare it to books like The Awakening, and The Scarlet Letter... so it may just be that compard to the two of those, it seemed rather drab. However, I didn't expect any of these books to grab me...but the ones that did, can't even measure up to My Antonia. My Antonia just seemed so dull and it felt as though it was lacking something."
3,A little slow,"This book started out great. I thought the story about the wedding and the wolves was very interesting. After they moved out to the city, the story kinda slowed down...way down. It didnt get good again untill Jim went to college. I really don't think this book is all that worth reading unless you have to."
4,"Beautiful writing, but the lack of plot means it's not for everyone","I loved this story of a time and place that is gone. It's elegiac and fond, and beautifully written. Characters are sketched out sparsely but intact, and her phrasing made me gasp with pleasure at times.But it has no plot. I cringe to think that children might be forced to read this. People who want to learn how to write should read this - Willa Cather writes beautifully. People who like character sketches or prose that captures a time and place unknown to them will like this. Things happen, as they do in a life. But not everything that happens is interesting (as in life.)"
5,Beautiful new edition,"The edition of this book that has a cover painting of Antonia in a white dress (ISBN 1438242905) has a fresh new design, inside and out. It's also a substantial size (6""x9"") and printed on high-quality paper, unlike the small mass-market editions printed on newsprint. A great bargain at this low price!"
3,A book for people who like details.,"I am in seventh grade, and love to read. I picked this book for our reading program. I found some parts of it very interesting, and funny. Other parts were very long, and way to detailed. Every once and a while I would find myself going to sleep from boredom. Other than that, the book was great, and I loved the history. This book would be good for anyone, just be prepared."
3,love story? plot? resolution?,"My Antonia was a beautiful book, however, I felt that it lacked a plot and resolution. I did not feel like it was a love story. To me, it was a story about a boy that was infatuated with the ""hired girls."" This story also seemed more historical than something I would read for pleasure."
3,Kind of Interesting,"A word of caution before I begin...do not let the very ""slow"" start of this book stop you! ""My Antonia"" is in many ways a deceptively simple book. Narrated by a boy, Jim, it chronicles his experiences of life on the early American prairie, and his friendship with a fascinating Bohemian immigrant girl, Antonia Shimerda. It is one of those unique books that is not controlled by a plot-it is a collection of Jim's memories and thoughts of Antonia, from his earliest remembrances to his thoughts as an adult. Although I am not overly fond of Willa Cather's simple writing style-I much prefer Betty Smith in ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"" this quiet book is a beautiful story and quite stunning in its own way."
4,Not bad after all.,"I was able to sink into the story after getting past the first few chapters. It took that much time for me to open up to the early twentieth century language. Once into the rhythm of the story, the only thing left was to imagine; an easy task given the writing ability of Willa Cather. As I reflect on the story, I'm certain that it was the strength of the characters that kept me interested. Antonia's voice is, now, as familiar to me as a close friend's. I won't bother with a summary of the story, plenty has been written about it over the years. I will say that I have been enriched by the experience and much better informed about the life of early settlers of the Western planes. While I'm not a big fan of the `Classics"" in general, this one held its own. No need to rush out and buy it, but put it on your list and be sure to get to it."
3,My Antonia,"This was a book that was enjoyable and easy to read. The author did a great job in drawing me the reader into the book. It was the typical american novel of the migration from the east to west coast. It also included imigrant migration, and there struggles to make it in america. Over all a good book to read."
4,My Antonia,"Cather displays a relationship between to unlike souls, who make a connection that lasts forever. Even though Jim and Antonia never explore their relationship beyond a platonic level,I loved the ending. It was maybe not the ending that everyone would want but that is what made it an interesting read. Once I started reading the novel I could not put it down. Cather also hints but never really mentions how the women are the strong and independent women. There was a matriachy of sorts in Mrs. Shimereda which is unusual for the time period. I recommend the book for a raining day when you have a couple of hours to relax. It is an easy read and you won't be able to put the book down."
4,Absorbing personal view of frontier life,"This ""classic"" book depicts plains frontier life in the mid 1800's with stark descriptions of the hardships encountered by two groups of pioneers, Americans emigrating from eastern states and immigrants from abroad. The detailed footnotes add background and color to the engrossing narrative without being intrusive. The title heroine is presented by an observer and has only moderate direct information presented. The story is tightly woven and moves forward at a brisk pace with interludes that mimic the plains life tempo."
4,My Antonia,"At the age of ten, Jim Burden travels by cross-country train to live with his grandparents on the Nebraska frontier. Jim meets a girl named Antonia. Antonia and Jim instantly become friends, and they spend a lot of time together outdoors, with Jim teaching her English. This is the story of Jim's and Antonia's life. It kept me hooked until the end."
4,A beautiful Story,"My Antonia weaves the tale of a young girl from Bohemia who comes to live on a Nebraskan farm where ""there was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made. "" In this new world, Antonia learns to survive and thrive even though she was not always socially accepted. Many people can relate to this feeling of being alone in new experiences and places. Antonia was strong and refused to conform to social pressures, some of the same pressures that people face today. Willa Cather describes the setting and characters so beautifully that it feels as though the reader is really there, learning along with Antonia and Jim. Her style of writing is smooth and easygoing, making this book a leisurely read. We found this book very delightful and would recommend it to all readers."
3,Well written with one problem...,"All who have read this book: I have enjoyed this book immensely, however, there is one thing that plagues me about it. The title of the book is ""My Antonia"", which would lead one to believe that the book is about someone's Antonia. There is very little mention of the charismatic Antonia in this book, rather, it seems to be an autobiography of the ""main"" character, who should not be the main character, Jim Burden. I was surprised and a little disappointed when I found out this information as I progressed through my reading. I wonder if anyone else has noticed this?"
2,Not a book that I loved...,"My Antonia is droning and full of pointless imagry. Although I understand that is a ""classic"" novel, it really just put me to sleep. Endless descriptions of the seemingly endless prairie made the book much longer than it should be. Although the plot is good and Antonia and Jim's coming of age is something most people can relate to, the events portrayed seem to modern to be happening in Black Hawk, Nebraska-1890's. Everyone's story is that of personal success and happiness. There are no plot twists and turns to keep the book interesting and after reading this book I doubt that I will ever pick up another Willa Cather novel again."
3,FRONTEER LIFE'S NEW VIEW,"Willa Cather's 'My Antonia' depicts family life during the late 1890's. We often hear of the struggles families had moving to a new nation at this time. However, this story provides a different theme with the views of people already living in the area, helping immigrants adapt. A Bohemian family moves to Nebraska, where families gladly reach out to help despite the Bohemian family's ironically unfriend attitude. The plot grows as a particular American family and the Bohemian family try to get along despite different opinions, customs, and beliefs. The Bohemian father states (regarding his young daughter), ""Te-e-ach, te-e-ach my An-tonia."" This very symbolic statement shows the desire both families have to learn from each other.I recomend this book to anyone that has had an interest in the 'Little House on the Prarie' series, for 'My Antonia' depicts fronteer life very well in a perspective we don't always think of."
3,"Quaint, charming, not riveting","Willa Cather's ""My Antonía"" is a quaint, charming story I'd recommend to anyone who prefers character to plot, and novels of manners to great themes. Not riveting like a novel by Melville or Kazantzakis, and with an easy language sans the ""muscularity"" of greater works, ""My Antonía"" deserves to stand the test of time, as a glimpse into America's past, her heartland, an America which really once was a ""nation of immigrants"". Even while reluctant to rank this book among the very best, I must be candid and confess that, Yes, I cared deeply for Antonía, felt saddened by her suffering, and admiration for her fortitude and courage. A VERY GOOD novel...just not a great one!"
2,A high school girl's point of view.,"This book is like reading the diary of somone who has lead the most boring life imaginable. The imagery however is pretty good. On the whole, I couldn't wait to finish this book, and throw it out the window."
3,uhhhhhhh,"I'm a sophomore in high school and am currenty reading this book for AP Language and Composition. It's very slow reading, but has some good themes and ideas. The characters are kind-of boring, but I can get along. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a historical fiction-type novel with many diverse characters and some interesting themes."
2,Slow Story of Human Development and a Special Friendship,"While I was emotionally touched by the friendship/love held by the two main characters, Antonia and Jim, I was rather unimpressed with her style. Much of the story, especially the first half, is filled with boring details of life in Nebraska and unimportant events that occur in thier lives. Characters are often times introduced superficially and then dug up again later in the story, leaving the reader to feel that he or she is missing something about the character being referred to. Possibly someone who enjoys the simple life and longs for the simple days of the past would get more out of this book."
5,A Classic Classic,"If all novels were written this well TV never would have gotten ahold of American society.This is one of the most romantic love stories I have ever read, and nary a kiss was had! Cather's beautiful flowing writing adds to the flowing beauty of the plains and her characters.As romantic as this novel is, it is not a chic book. It captures the times and people of a bygone era in wonderful and unrivalled prose."
5,Willa Cather is masterful!,"No one depicts life on the American frontier as well as Willa Cather. Life was harsh but never the less filled with simple joys. This was a tender story of growing up in a world that has been lost forever, and of first love."
1,So boring it'll make you cry!,"THIS BOOK HAS NO PLOT! Even my English teacher admitted it. Maybe it has beautiful writing, but I honestly fell asleep while reading it. For me, it defines the word dull."
1,Timeless quality,I read this book after a recommendation from my sister. WHAT A TREAT. It has a timeless quality about the narrative that makes it a pleasure to read. Written with great skill and an interesting plot. I have since begun reading some more classics from this fine author....
1,Worst book I ever read.,"This was the worst book I ever read. It had no point, no plot, and I hated it. It was so terrible. I only read for required reading for school. I will never read any of this woman's books again. It should be a crime to even call her an author. It should be a federal offense to call her a good author. I don't know how this book got published."
4,Good original replacement,"This is a exact replacement for the original insert. I wish I had bought a zero clearance insert instead. It's cheaper, has an opening that is just as big as you want, and fits perfectly. Still, the original does the job if you do not mind the large gap between the blades and the insert. The original is easy to adjust and fits as designed."
4,Does a pretty decent job,"These are fairly easy to use. Making sure the ground is nice and level is one of the most critical parts of using these and pays off in the end. At first I was disappointed that the bottom half of the mold is open and creates one continuous piece instead of individual pavers, but it saved on sand for the joints and made a stronger slab. It creates joints that only go down half way in the center of the mold and you can't tell any difference after you sand the joints anyway so it really isn't a big deal. Near the end of the project the molds started to arch a little. Wish the plastic would have been a little stronger, but that is about the only complaint. We are happy with the results."
5,"Tough work, but looks great",I wanted to make a walkway in my front yard. I got two forms to save some money and they worked great. Word of advice: get a concrete mixer! Spend the $50 bucks at your local home depot and rent one for a few hours. I mixed four bags by myself and it was awful! Keep the concrete a little dry and compress the concrete into the forms with your hands (buy heavy duty rubber gloves). Smooth top with a little water and large trowel. Looks great and form removes almost instantly.
2,Just ok,I used this walk maker to make a medium sized patio. It will kill your back and takes a lot of time to cover very much area. The mold begins to curve or loose its flat shape after a bit of use. I found it work's best with a slightly wet mix of concrete.
3,Concrete is not fun,"This works but is NOT fun. You have to mix a lot, lot, lot, lot of concrete. Did I say you have to mix a lot of concrete. I rented a commercial mixer, 62 bags of 80# concrete is still not fun (for a small patio). Adding color makes it look nice but can be messy. Good luck."
1,Terrible product,"This product is terrible. I purchased this product to help rehabilitate an inpinged shoulder. I used it three times before the pulley melted out of the plastic bracket. Be smart, by a pulley with a metal bracket."
3,simple shoulder pulley exerciser,"I was very impressed at this neat device at first. It was inexpensive, arrived quickly, and is packed in a convenient plastic zipper pouch. It easily fit in my bag of home P.T. tools (I'm a travelling therapist). I was delighted when I first used it with a patient! Smooth action and easy to block in the door. However, after being in my car for 2 weeks (in California), the handles MELTED! They stuck to the pouch but I was able to peel them away from it and use it a second time. It won't be difficult to replace them with wood or plastic so I'm keeping it only because it's easy to pack. If you are keeping it indoors, it should be fine. The pully is also fairly pliable so I don't know about the durability. I believe it would be fine for a 2-3 month home shoulder rehab program for a single user."
4,armacost shines in debut,"Riveting and daring Armacost transposes you into the lives of four young men whose love for each other seem to be all they have. Inner Indianapolis is the setting, but it's America at it's best and at it's worst. Love and hate are central themes that make you reflect on the state of our nation and how we've managed to let ""the dream"" escape millions. As time passes the four boys turn to men, and have life choices to make. Thier choices reveal who they really are, and in the end that makes all the difference. Laugh and cry with Armacost as he takes you on a ride you won't forget. A must read for any 20 or 30 something!"
4,Almost five star!!,Anyone else would rate this book as being worthy of five stars. Especially when you consider that this is Andrew's first published work. I'm grading on a curve because I've read some of Andrew's UN-published work.Four Pallbearers' gritty look at five young men coming of age in a less than perfect world will take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride. You know these guys. You care about these guys. You are these guys.
1,Wish I Could Give It ZERO Starts,"In my 49 years, I've read literally thousands of books on many, many categories, but I've never HATED a character before the way I do Llian. I struggled through the first three books but couldn't finish this one. Karan is such an exemplary character with incredible courage and wiles - and she falls for this [DUD]? Puh-leaze! Like I said, I've hated books because of lack of story line, lack of action, etc., but I've never stopped reading a book because I hated one of the heroes(?). Don't waste your money on the series like I did."
5,Start Here,"This is the most complete, concise, and up-to-date survey or Rome from c.1000 B.C. to c.600 A.D. Along with the standard political, military, and legal narrative comes several chapters detailing Roman thought, religion, economy, agriculture, families, technology, and art. Useufl maps are abundant in this edition. Don't be awed by the price tag -- it is well worth it."
2,Written for a Historian Already Familiar with the History of Rome,"This is a poorly written, textbook style book. It is an extremely boring read.The book focuses on the sources of information used by historians as much as the history itself. The large amount of text dedicated to the early (pre-historic) history was not made meaningful in the context of how Rome developed.If you want an overview of how The Roman Empire developed I would suggest you search elsewhere."
5,Love this DVD and the whole series!,"We've had this for several years - own vol 1 and 2 - these and the other signing time videos we own are among our most played. The Signing Time Story is inspirational, the videos are educational and fun. I enjoyed using them with my 3rd and 4th babies, but the older kids liked them too and they helped all of us (and grandma) learn how to sign with our little ones. My 3rd child could sign 60+ words before she could speak - what an amazing window into her little world that I might not otherwise have had. I also love the the videos show children of all abilities. Great series - 3 and 4 came along too late for us to use with little ones, but if I had a older baby/toddler, I would definitely be interested."
5,Excellent Product,"My daughter is two and cannot talk, but because of the signing time DVD's my daughter is able to communicate with me through signing. She enjoys watching the DVD and asks to watch it. This DVD series has help me and my daughter out so much."
2,Signing Time Video,"The video itself is good, but not what I ordered. I ordered Baby signing time volume 2 and got signing time volume 2. I didn't want to go through the hassle of a return so I guess I'm stuck. Amazon messed up on this order."
2,Not as good as volume 1,"The music wasn't as engaging, and too many signs were put together in a single song without individual attention. My 13 month old didn't really want to watch it, whereas he loves volume 1."
5,Baby Signing Times is the Bomb!,"I have the first collection of BST and my daughter loves it! She just turned 1 and we started watching them at about 6 months. She knew 23 signs by 11 months! It has made life easier for all of us and she gets such a joy from being able to communicate with us! This is a great series-and I am not an advocate of TV/video watching. But the physical interaction, vivid pictures and songs are fabulous-engaging and applicable to everyday life.Nothing but praise!"
5,great dvd,"This dvd is great.My 16 month old watched it once and remembered at least 6 of the signs,socks and shoes was the first i asked him and that was the next day and he new what i said without speaking.we have been signing since he was 6 months he does very well even though he can hear."
2,"Beware this is Vol.2, and each vol has 8+ episodes","If you want loved Vol1, disk 1, search for Vol1, disk 2 (hard to find) to get the next set of baby words. Vol2 is targeted towards bigger kids."
5,Baby Signing Time - AWESOME,Baby Signing Time is simply amazing - our 14 month old can communicate using sign so effectively. She asks fro food and water and lets us know when she is tired. She loves to talk about shoes and socks. we already have the next video in the series. I recommend this to any parent.
4,Good DVD,"My daughter really enjoyed the music on this DVD, although she never got into the signing. I am going to attempt again with her, we will see how it goes. The songs are cute, and she liked seeing the kids signing."
5,Baby Signing time 2,My little girl is 20 months and absolutely loves this video. It has helped her to talk more with and without the signs. She loves this video and would watch it once a day more if I let her. She started signing and trying to talk 14 months old.
3,Not as fun as 1,"My 16 month old has been watching these for a month now and he loves the songs in Volume 1 and does some of those signs already, but the Volume 2's songs don't seem as fun, and there seem to be more graphics rather than real things in this one too. He gets bored and walks off. He sits and watches the whole Volume one though which is literally the only thing he'll watch. He hasn't learned any of the 2 signs because he won't watch it. Still good, but not for my child."
5,educational,"my little one is glued to screen and learning very quickly ,its a must have if looking into sign language!!!!!"
5,My kid loves it!,"We bought this for our child, after watching a couple times a week, (it wasn't part of her daily routein, just watched occasionally for fun... she was picking up and using sign language along with words as a part of her communication. She now says ""more, food, please, and several other words with sign. really works, thanks!"
4,Signing time for babies is great!,"We already had a copy of the regular Signing Time (Vol. 1 ""My first signs"") so I was a little hesitant to get a DVD that had a lot of signs that our daughter already knew, but... WOW! So worth it. Our daughter was just barely one year old when we popped in the ""Here I Go"" DVD and she loves it! She is mesmerized by the other babies doing the signs, and only gets a little bored during some of the longer songs. It has helped us communicate with her so much. She can tell us when she sees a car or a bus (which she loves to point out), and she is learning how to ask for things using please and thank you. We learn the signs right along with her, and the DVD is only about twenty minutes long so I don't feel too bad letting her watch it twice a day. She asks for it over and over!"
5,Give your baby a way to communicate!,"My 3 year old grandson has all the baby signing times videos and knows all the signs. Once, he was able to tell his parents his older brother was hurt outside. He has also been able to tell them when he was hungry, thirsty or hurt. The ability to communicate before they are really able to speak all these words is absolutely invaluable and avoids much frustration and acting out due to an inability to make themselves known. I just bought the first 2 videos for my youngest grandson."
2,for older babies,"I started the ""My First Signs"" from Baby Einstein at around 5 months, and my baby loves it. He watched it every day for a long time. But I get sick of the same thing over and over, and the later Baby Einstein videos with sign language don't really teach babies the signs--there is not enough reinforcement. So I looked around for another series and bought this DVD and a ""My Baby Can Talk"" at the same time. This DVD was not interesting to my 8-month-old. He likes the ""My Baby Can Talk,"" but this one spends too long on one idea to hold his attention. We will try it again in several more months, though."
2,Pure marketing,"I like Celine Dion and I have all her american albums, but I'm not interested in this one. Since Celine is not working this year, Sony decided to release this CD, but there's nothing very new. Most part of the songs are taken from her previous albums, and perhaps the best song is ""power of the dream"" from the olympic games of 96 (unreleased track). I hope the other volumes of this collection are better!"
2,"I really like Celine, but what was this?","I was just a little confused when this cd came out a few years ago. I bought it because well...it's Celine, and I adore her. BUT...why did she release this cd besides to make some money during her absence? I mean' C'mon! Where's volume 2 or 3? Are we going to get them, or are we just stuck with this volume 1 with VERY RANDOM songs on it? If you're a Celine fan, get this cd to fill out your collection, but if you're not...don't waste your money. If you want a Celine album, I would recommend All the Way: Decade of Hits, and One Heart."
1,oh please,"i hate celine more and more. she is no longer singing, she is croaking, and i hate my heart will go on. and thinking that this is a great album, i stupidly go and buy it. is there a refund?"
2,"Two greatest hits retrospectives--and still no ""Think Twice""","While I continue to enjoy Celine's music, it's baffling that neither of her retrospectives released in the US contain ""Think Twice""--the single that made Celine Dion the megastar that she is around the world (especially in the UK and Australia). Why is that?Also, why bother with a Vol.3? Celine Dion has only released 5 full-length English language studio CDs...it does not justify rereleasing and repackaging all that material again and again.A bit of a letdown, but oh well, the true fans will lap it up."
4,Collection,"Another Greatest Hits Collection, the first in this volume, contains many of Celine's hits like Tell Him, Where Does My Heart Beat Now, Seduces Me, Falling Into You, The Reason, That's The Way It is and many more. The highlight is the song The Power of the Dream, a song Celine sang at the 1996 Olympic games. Overall a nice collection but it could have been better."
4,New York Subways: An Illustrated History of New York City's Transit Cars,"New York Subways: An Illustrated History of New York City's Transit CarsGreat book for the subway fan. It is a comprehensive history of the cars, well illustrated. Also includes a complete set of drawings and specifications, valuable for modelers. Writing style a little repetitious and awkward at times."
4,Great Blades!,I purchased these to replace the original blades that have served me well for several years. They are razor sharp. I hope they last as long as the original blades.
4,Lovecraft is an important writer,"And this collection of short stories contains some real gems. It's important to realize that it can be awfully hard to read more than a couple Lovecraft stories together in a row because it can feel really overly portentious as a collection-- indescribable horror and beauty on every page. However, taken separately, these stories are all first class reads."
4,Good stories for a rainy afternoon.,"Being a Steven King fan, I had heard that some of King's short stories and writings had been similar to Lovecrafts, and this collection of short stories were pretty good reads. The Shadow Over Innsmouth, and The Lurking Fear were probably the most interesting, and I liked The Temple as well. The other stories were ok. The Outsider was also interesting and Dagon was just plain wierd. If you like horror and wierd stuff, this book is defenitly a must. Its different anyway."
4,Great first look,"This is the first HP Lovecraft book I bought, and it provided a wonderful introduction to the author. These stories will scare and disturb you-- you won't forget them. I highly recommend Lovecraft if you've enjoyed the short horror works of Stephen King and *especially* if you've enjoyed stories like Edgar Allan Poe's ""Black Cat."" It's that same sort of supernatural horror."
2,NOT what I thought.,"I purchased this album thinking it would was by another artist by the same name, and I turned out to be very very wrong.This is not the 90's emo band.Its a crappier sounding Pink Floyd."
3,RIPOFF,"Hi this is album is great but it HAS NOT been remastered i have rung the company who stated it hasn't and it sounds like it. The reason I'm giving it three stars is for the following reasons.1)Not remastered2)CD notes are non existent less than the original release.3)Quick cash in because Angels albums bring big money on ebay as they have been out of print for some years.The Angels were a big and important band in Australias music history and this Australian company should feel embarrassed at the shoddy treatment they have given The Angels back catalogue, next time let Aztec Music do the reissues as they know how to do them properly. What a wasted opportunity"
5,this book is a star,"As a doctor who is interested in all aspects of healing and asks the ""why"" as much as the ""how"" , I found this book to be a source of much information, a guiding light. I hope someday to find time to study it in depth and find further patterns in the dicoveries she has made.At the least, this book will open up your mind , and life will become very interesting ;)At the most it will answer those questions we are always afraid to ask, even of our doctors: Why do i have this disease? Is it my fault? and what does it all MEAN ?!"
3,Fairly useful but more how-to detail would have made it more valuable,"The author's story (which doesn't intrude all that much) was personally remarkable: a narcoleptic MD with spinal troubles who becomes a ""medical intuitive."" There was some good information here, running along the same lines as Anatomy Of The Spirit by Caroline Myss: basically how certain health conditions arise out of imbalances in the chakras (which Schultz, betraying a little western-medicine snobbery, terms ""emotional centers"" even though it's obvious she's talking about chakras). This book seemed less grim than Anatomy, but could have included more detail on how everyone can develop her own intuition about chakra health."
1,Not recommended,"Far too wordy, unfocused, rambling, repetitive, self-congratulatory, and filled with too many anecdotes. So much of it is common sense, I found myself immediately bored and wondering why I was spending my time pushing through it. I can't tell you how many times I screamed, ""Get to the point!"". I think the reviewer celeste said it best. This book may have been good with a much better (i.e. firmer) editor involved, but the author was given too much leeway. I have forced my way through 124 pages and can't do any more. Save your money!"
1,Good book until....,I was happy with what this book was telling me until I read things that I don't believe in that I wouldn't proscribe. I will sell it as soon as I can.
2,"about the author's intuitive powers, not yours","The topic is so worthy of exploration. In this age of left-brain worship, it's critical that someone with Dr. Schulz's qualifications gives us a treatise on why the right brain should be celebrated for its powers, and why its ""messages"" should be heeded more. Yet this book winds up being a treatise on Dr. Schulz, on how dazzling she finds her own intuitive powers, to an almost maddening degree. The reader is repeatedly told that awakening intuition is important, but is never, in this longwinded book, given the tools to do it."
2,Better borrowed than bought,"Without question sections of this book are intriguing and well-written, medical research is cited to support the role of intuition, and it reinforces the importance of knowing yourself and making healthy decisions. In the end, however, I was disappointed and irritated with this book. It is far too long, more than a little repetitive, condescending at times, and overly simplistic. In addition, there are several occasions when the text reads more like an autobiography of the author's numerous illnesses/ailments than an exploration of the importance of the mind/body connection."
3,Cliches upon cliches...,"At first, I was really excited by the book as one of the main points of the book was about revival. That for true revival, our hearts need to be broken so that we may be emptied to be used by God... definitely true.However, I think every other sentence was ""by the blood of Jesus."" Not to say that it's a bad thing in any way, but I don't think that the writer makes the best use of words and of the reader's time when he repeats a few, although true, statements dozens of times all over the book. It can be distracting and annoying... at least it was for me, but I'm sure not everyone will feel the same.Content is decent and reassuring, but the writing style and unefficiency of the use of words is brings it down considerably."
1,Disappointed,"I read this book for a Bible study and all I got from it was an overwhelming sense of doubt and guilt that made me wonder if I was really a Christian after all. I got the impression that in wanting anything for myself and my life I was committing the ultimate sin. Finally I realized that everyone has a different way of worship and you can't expect everyone to conform to the same standards. I am glad if this book has helped others, but it didn't really help me."
5,Life-changing book,"Next to the Bible itself, this is the most important book I have ever read. It gets right to my heart: it is only for those who are willing to give up all to follow Jesus down the Calvary Road."
5,A must read,Tought to read but very good to read. It speaks to the heart of what is wrong with Christians and non-Christians alike.
5,This book has caused me to think about my every attitude,"After reading this book and doing a book report for Bible College, I really think about all my attitudes and my reactions to others. I want to serve Christ in the best way He can use me. I realize now that I must be totally broken, changing the self-centered life to a Christ Centered life. I know now that I must immediately confess any sin to keep the vessel open for God to use. This Calvary road is the only way for true revival, never doing things from the flesh. Thankyou for this book."
4,Pas de Tot,My young ballet class likes the music on this cd and they recognize a few songs and start to sing along. Music is easy to follow and is a good cd to have for young ones. I just wish there were more on the cd.
4,Good documentary - very good for overview of Thatcher's life,This video is an overview .. great detail of Margaret Thatcher's Life - focusing on her time as prime minister. Ths is a documentary. As a documentary this is very good.
5,Compelling,Excellent documentary! It really gives me a new appreciation for this amazing woman. It is a captivating peek into her life and really shows the strength and sheer acumen she possesses.
1,Margaret Thatcher - Iron Lady,Absolutely appalled to find we had purchased a documentary not the movie. Did not watch it. There should be some clarification on the webpage so that other people don't make the same mistake.
4,Track Listing,"This is a good, overlooked album. Will's guitar playing is excellent, as always. I like Ian McCulloch better on vocals but this guy is decent. Give it a listen at Grooveshark since Amazon isn't providing samples.1. Gone, Gone, Gone2. Enlighten Me3. Cut & Dried4. King of Your Castle5. Devilment6. Thick Skinned World.7. Freaks Dwell8. Senseless9. Flaming Red10. False Goodbyes"
3,It certainly sounds like E+TBM...,"While this is by no means a bad album, let's face it, it really isn't Echo and the Bunnymen. While it certainly sounds like Echo, the new vocalist just doesn't quite embody the same soul of the group that Ian did. While Noel isn't necessarily a bad vocalist, some of his vocals are slightly over the top and make some already fairly corny (but certainly no worse than ""Hip hip HOP! Flip flip FLOP!""), even more campy.So, if ti sounds like I'm complaining too much, I will say that the disc does contain a few good tracks: Gone Gone Gone, Flaming Red, Enlighten Me.In short, with not just Ian absent on the album, but also Pete de Frietas, a new moniker might've saved this album from unreasonably high expectations. All in all, worth downloading."
1,Production problem.,"This should have been a fantastic CD. However, I found that the CD has been improperly mastered, and that the rhythm overrides the melody, ruining the CD.Fans of the masterful music of Los Indios Trabajaras, should look to other selections, for the best in their music. It really is a shame."
4,Loved the Record,"I'll have to admit, I have not heard the CD. I own the record. (Yes way back from the 70s.) It has always been on of our favorites when we just want beautiful, relaxing guitar music. We love it!"
4,This book shows the inequalities in K-12 education,"Jeannie Oakes put forth the idea that tracking does not have a silver lining. When students are tracked, some are left behind. De-tracking may not be the answer but this topic (her work) is worth reading. I think that the previous review (the only other one as of 11/00) does not give Jeannie Oakes enough credit for her research on this topic. If you pick up the book and read it I'm sure you'll realize there is much inequality built into our educational system. For this alone...I'd read some of her work."
5,Earth Medicine A Shamanic way To Self Discovery,"This book is a wonderful tool for those of you who are looking to get back in touch with your inner self. It is very easy to follow along with and elementary to understand. Meadows breaks down each area in a simplistic way and gradually builds upon what you are learning. Once you have gone through each section you will have a complete 'Earth Medicene Web' to use for every one you know. If you are interested in astrology, but would like another way to discover more about yourself and your purpose in life, your 'Earth Walk', this is the book for you."
5,"Fun movie, worth watching!","My sister showed me this little movie that she discovered. I was surprised that it was actually alot of fun and entertaining. Although it's not a big budget picture, the story and script draw you in, the acting is quite good. It drags a tiny bit, but the leading lady kicks butt as the 'anti-hero' character. At the end, it almost had the feeling of a long pilot for a TV series and you wish you could come back next week to see the continuing adventures of Banshee!"
5,Love it!!,"I had a copy of this for 10 yrs. I used it so much it was falling apart so I had to order a new one.Much wonderful food - easy to do. Sometimes the recipes look complicated due to a ""lot"" of ingredients - but they are usually seasonings you have on hand if you cook much. Good step by step directions that are not difficult make it easy to use."
5,"Great cookbook, reasonably prices","We don't use cookbooks as often as we used to due to the internet. However, our meals at Commander's Palace have been memorable, so their cookbook is one we wanted. Found on Amazon and received in great condition, now, we just need to start cooking."
3,Expected more...,"I bought this expecting to be blown away, but was disappointed. I knew it was an older cookbook... so I blame myself to some extent. I guess I was looking for the food I know from the more recent chefs there. Though I am an adventurous cook, I found many of these recipes weren't very approachable. Enjoyed the stories, but wish I had found more recipes that are do-able outside a restaurant kitchen."
3,Not if you are looking for details on Shree Yantra,"Well, I was expecting much more from the book and specially going by the author. Little disappointed with the information. Try some other if you are looking for in depth info on Shree Yantra. The language isn't the best to grasp quickly."
2,More a collection of anectodes than a guide book,"This book is more a collection of climbing history and anectodes than a profound guide book. In particular for easier climbs (less than 5.9) the technical route description is usually less than 2 sentences. Consistent information on wall height, number of pitches, typical climbing times, rock quality and necessary gear are missing completely. Only for some routes (mostly rated 5.10a or higher or very popular ascents in the Mt. Whitney range) handdrawn topos are provided that let you guess some of the details in advance. The only valuable information available for EVERY route is a photo of the mountain with the line of ascent.In case of a third edition the authors should familiarize with international standards. A more formal approach will prevent neglecting the large number of climbs that they have NOT done by themselves."
5,This is the one!,"If you are interested in converting or would like to know more about the jewish way of life, then this is the book to read.Rabbi Wylen explains it all in a very understanding way. I loved it."
4,Amazing,"A great book for adults who have forgotten a lot since gradeschool, or for those looking to convert. In-depth discussion of a wide range of topics."
1,Don't waste your money on this tuner!,"I have owned several tuners, none of which have ever broken...except the Intelli tuner. I have two of these and both are broken...don't waste your money on this brand."
4,Great Metronome/Tuner Combo,"Great for tuning. Haven't used the metronome very much but what I have it has been good. One draw back is that sometimes the tuner option doesn't want to switch over to the metronome option, and the tuner is a bit off from some of the other brands."
2,ugh broke!,"the switching from the metronome to the tuner...not so great. The metronome stopped working after a few days, and would occassionally work. It wasn't worth the shipping and hassle to get another one. the tuner works though."
2,Failed attempt at a collaboration,"Reportedly there was a lot of friction between Eno and Cale on this recording, with their diametically-opposed approaches to working. The daggers shown going between them on the cover tends to bear this out.As does the music, which is an uncomfortable mix of Enoisms and Caleisms, with very little middle ground. The tension is palpable, and beyond the curiosity value of their feud, very little of musical interest survives the tension. A minor, if not forgettable album."
2,Sorry I dont get it...,I just dont get this recording....I love both of these people but I have listened to this and I just dont get it....
2,I was sent incorrect color,"I ordered 5-ea Thermwell PW72G 2.25"" x 72' Green Re-web Kits. I was incorrectly sent PW72B - blue - kits. How do I get this corrected?Lois Stevens"
3,Not bad...,"many people dislike this album because they compare it with ""Maverick a Strike""... but I think that if ""Maverick"" is a more compact work with great sound patterns and lovely production, this ""Vanguard"" has better songs... just listen to ""The emperor"", ""Burning"" and ""Everybody knows""... in fact there is always the fact that Quaye is not a great composer (most of the tracks are useless and boring), but if I had to play something from the Finley Quaye repertoire, I would choose it from ""Vanguard"" either than from ""Maverick a Strike""..."
2,Disappointing,"Well obviously I'm in the minority here but... Let me say that ""Maverick A Strike"" was, and still is, one of my favorite albums. When it first came out I could not get enough of it and drove my wife and friends crazy with it. This one just does not do it for me. It does not flow as easily. It's ""Rock Song,"" ""Funk Song,"" ""Ballad"" all just thrown on one after another with no cohesion. If I didn't know better I'd think that this was his first CD and was still trying to develop his style, which he definitely had on ""Maverick..."" I put it on 3 times, 4 times, finally it just got on my nerves, and nothing stayed with me. The songs just didn't grab me like they did on ""Maverick."" I'm glad that most people seem to like it, though, so he'll likely put out a third disc that will hopefully fulfill the promise of ""Maverick."""
3,Somewhat disapointing,"I to loved his first cut, but other than Broadcast, which had he stuck with this sound this album would have been an instant classic, this compliation isn't worth owning. Still if your a fan, Broadcast is worth a listen."
2,If it aint broke........,"This album was really dissapointing to me. Maverick A Strike was absolutely phenominal. I remember hearing it for the first time and instantly running out to buy it. Thus, when vanguard finally came to the US I was extemely excited. I was hoping for more innovation, fantastic vocals, and musical wit. What I heard, unfortunately, was a lacklustre 'expreimental album.' The production in this albim is like soggy chips compared to Maverick A. I cant remember a single tune. Nothing made me want to move or really even nod my head. Experimentation is fine...but too much self indulgence can ruin an album. This is a perfect example of that."
5,A must see!!,"I enjoyed watching Across the Line, the director Martin Spottl, captures the Latino experience in America. This movie is worth a watch. Enjoy it as I did!"
1,FOUL AND BAD,"I watched a good portion of the movie and I had to eject it and take it out. There was a lot of scenes that were inappriotate and the foul language didn't belong in the movie. It also was trying to make US LEGAL CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES feel sorry for the illegals coming across the border(s). I don't buy it!!!If you are looking for a good clean movie, this ain't it. Good luck finding a better quality movie without a lot of the garbage in it."
2,really loud!,"product works great but it is incredibly loud. too distracting to be used on a daily basis. i am using it to aerate a tank of feeders, and it's fine for that, but i can't imagine this in a kid's room running all the timevery distracting"
1,Never received but charged.,"I ordered this item for my daughter's 21st birthday last October and was billed over $50 to my Master Card. It never arrived.I contacted the seller and never received a response OR a credit to my account. Unless there is a resolution to my case, Isuggest that potential buyers stay away."
5,"Practical, readable, compassionate","This is another excellent book by Chris Ziegler Dendy. The author presents practical information that will help parents in their day to day struggle to deal with the changing world of an adolescent with ADHD. She clearly has dealt with some of these stiuations herself, so she brings humorous and compassionate anecdotes to illustrate the factual material. I would highly recommend this and her other books on the practical aspects of dealing with adolescents with ADHD"
4,Some good tactics,"This book series provides good contextual listening situations. There is an emphasis on listening for jist and content which is good for Asian students to realize they don't have to understand every word. This book lacks pronounciaton exercises, but otherwise it is an outstanding high intrest listening text.This text is well suited for begining and low intermediate learners but may not be challanging enough for high students."
1,"Sorry guys, does NOT work on Asian women!","I tried this thinking that it would be a miracle thing which would make me a magnate. Boy, was I wrong!!!Most Sri Lankan females found this extremely offensive, even after an application of just one drop.But then, I'm kinda glad that this did not work, for I met someone subsequently and she liked me for me! Not because of what I was transmitting artificially."
4,Good enough!,"Folks what do you expect from a portable tv!? It's working fine for me. Common sense tells me, it all depends on where you live. Some areas get good reception, some area don't. One trick, use the antenna and the antenna wires (most wires will do) at the same time. It does help. Compare to other portable tv's, this one is doing fine for me. Enjoy."
4,handy,This was a gift for my husband. He uses the TV when he is in his truck traveling. He likes it because it is color and small enough to go anywhere.
4,Nice little TV.,"Keeping in mind that analog television signals will be extinct in another year or so, I think this TV is a bit overpriced.Having said that,It's everything you would expect from a battery operated portable television of this size. The controls are simple and the picture is acceptable.The fact that a protective case for this thing has to be special ordered for an additional 15 or 20 dollars is a drag but what can you do? You either need it or you don't."
1,Poorly made !!!,Doesnt work. the screen doesnot remain still.useless piece of electric circuits...total junk
5,best gps ever,"this is one of the best , fastest , and easiest gps's to use . i have had this type of gps for many years the biggest problem with it is the window holder with suction cup . very flimsy went thru 4 of them . other than that excellent unit"
2,Horrible Performance,"I bought two of these units because of the price but they aren't worth any price. I have used two Garmin units in the past but thought why not try this one - how bad can it be? It is just about useless. The screen is great, entering the destination was great - but what matters is the performance and it was terrible. If you went past a turn (testing it) it tried to make you do a U-turn, even though the road I was on was parallel to the road it wanted me to be on. It couldn't recalculate properly, it was determined to send me backwards and if I kept driving eventually it would recalculate like it should have. It did this multiple times. I couldn't believe how stupid it was. My Garmin product never did that. Don't buy it - buy a Garmin. I am."
1,HK SHould Keep to Audio Equipment And Stay Away From GPS.,"UTTERLY USELESS GPS. The first one would not find any sats at all. The replacement tells me I am a block away from my house when I am sitting on the front porch. I traded emails with Tech Support and they had me try all of the usual tasks to no avail and then just stopped responding at all. I finally got the update provided by tech support to load, but then it was even more off on its location. Not to mention it takes forever to find sats when it bothers to find them at all. It has never found more than 3 or 4 of them even though more than 10 are available.STAY Away from this unit at all costs. I am going back to Garmin or TomTom for my GPS needs."
2,nice design. lots of functinalities. poor algorithm.,"i bought this unit last year because:(+) nice screen size and resolution.(+) built-in MP3/WMA music player with SD slot(+) Harman Kardon brand nameand i returned it after 3-week use in multiple states because:(-) TERRIBLE algorithm and possibly old maps. the software told me to turn left into no-left-turn roads / one-way / into freeway many times.(-) slow satellite lock-on time, sometimes even minutes. actually slower than my Sprint Mogul.you don't want to be a GPS horror story."
2,Harman Kardon GPS300`NA - 2012 update,"Great and inexpensive GPS system. Easy to operate out of the box after following the battery charging procedure. Unit automatically switches from day to night mode. The unit includes maps for Anchorage, Alaska which was not denoted in the description, the description stated that maps of Canada and America were preloaded. Clarification was requested but not received in a timely manner. I made the purchase with the risk that the unit was inoperable in Alaska.2012 update - had so much trouble in obtaining updates on the unit, I gave the unit away and purchased a new TOMTOM unit, much friendly and easily updateable."
4,Good XY table at a reasonable price,I bought this to get better precision on my drill press and to allow some light milling. I am not a machinist but try to play one on TV so I had no expectations. I did my homework and this looked like a good deal. Grizzly shipped super fast and it came in 2 days. X axis was a little loose and easily adjusted. Y axis is worse because of play in the threads not a dovetail problem. I wish it was tighter but I can live with it. This table is for the hobbyist. If you are professional machinist you will be disappointed. But I am happy with it and would recommend the table if you don't need nuts on accuracy. + or - a few mm is fine with what I am going.
3,One more chapter?,"In this novel, Penelope Fitzgerald develops a group of fascinating characters and relationships. She manages to do this just over 130 pages. However, this story does not seem complete. It leaves the reader with many questions and wishing for perhaps one more chapter."
3,not so good,"I was expecting more, too many sentences are near-hits, leave too much to the reader, not enough done by the writer. Stick to Bookshop. That's the flawless book, not this one."
4,Setting device worked really well,"The characters here are almost ""defined"" by the setting, as opposed to learning about them through lots of interior thought or dialogue. That's there, but this story has a visual feel to it. If ""Golden Child"" isn't available, this would make a good alternative Fitzgerald introduction."
2,not a dazzler,"I read Offshore in my pursuit of reading all the Booker winners. I was initially intrigued by the premise of getting a view into a community of offbeat characters living on boats in London's Battersea Reach in the early 60's. I was expecting kind of a Bohemian group, but actually the characters are fairly conventional. While the prose is decent, I was never driven to keep reading by character, plot, or theme. It's quite short, so I did finish it, but so little happened in those pages, I would not recommend this book to anyone. I finished the work wondering, ""why was this so special? Did I miss something, or was it such a work of the moment that now it has faded?"""
3,'you don't belong to land or water',The tale of an eclectic mix of people living in close proximity in houseboats on 1960s Battersea Reach. It's a short (180 p)novel and while it makes for an entertaining read I didn't feel particularly drawn in by any of the people.Fitzgerald doesn't describe their emotions but allows us to try to understand them by witnessing their actions and conversations. There's struggling mother Nenna who's separated from her husband; efficient and wealthy Richard with his peculiar wife; male prostitute Maurice; artist Willis...The weakest perhaps- despite being the spunkiest character- was 6 year old Tilda. Although she's had to grow up fast she just doesn't come across as a small child; she acts quite maturely and never shows childlike emotion. Although we're told 'Tilda cared nothing for the future and had as a result a great capacity for happiness' it still doesn't ring true.As the residents deal with unhappy marriages and leaky boats we witness their camaraderie.
3,Less than the sum of its parts,"The characters are well sketched, the milieu is portrayed with detail, and the prose is sharp and economical. Some parts stick with me (the children scavenging the riverbed at low tide for small treasures from shipwrecks, or the irrational attachment the owners feel for their houseboats). Given the strong evocation of an era and a milieu, given the characters brought to life, and given the clever interaction between the characters, it is amazing to me that this book adds up to so little.It is sad that Penelope Fitzgerald is so talented at setting the scenes, but does so little with them; it is as if she delights (and excels) in assembling the ingredients but stops short of using them to produce a great novel.Fitzgerald is not among my desert island authors, which includes Nabokov, Calvino and Maugham."
2,"Prententious, minimalist nothing","I notice that above there are only book critics, who all loved this book.I'm not and I didn't. I bought it (paid full price, worse luck) on the strength of its having won the Booker prize. I liked Byatt and other Booker prize winners, but this thing is ridiculous. It might do as an outline for a novel, but it certainly isn't one as it stands. Fitzgerald apparently was trying to win the prize for terse signifcance. In my book, she got the terse, but the significance escapes me. Don't bother with this if you like real novels."
2,At least one contradiction...,"In the book, Roche complains that high presidential salaries are an example of corruption in universities. Some universities pay presidents more than $400,000 per year! However, according to Forbes magazine, at one point in his tenure Roche himself was making $524,000 per year.Oh well. He's not a president anymore. Maybe he's changed his mind."
4,great under rated band,"Found this very rare cd used ,the cover caught my eye for obvious reasons so I bought it.When i listened to it I was very impressed ,has an 80's metal soundsome songs sound a little like def leppard...some are just good rockin tunes...overall this is a great cd, get it if you can ever find it!"
2,witchcraft 2,this movie is too old for me to like. its basically from the 80's not there's anything wrong with that. i like some movie's from then its just that it has 80's graphics and 80's graphics suck.
3,Book of Love CD,This CD is almost 20 years old. It has lots of little scratches. One of song skips because it's scratched badly. I was kind of disappointed especially because I've been looking for this CD for a long time.
5,I was so excited to find this book again.,"Thirty years ago when my daughters were just learning to cook, I bought this book. It is so beautiful, full of recipes from some of their favorite childhood icons. They were very excited to see it again!"
2,IOMEGA HDD 250,"1. It's an Iomega product but it was given to me so its free - that is good thing (I think).2. It sounds like a cement mixer - that is bad thing.3. It does not power down automatically at system shut down time requiring me to remember (not hard since it screams) to manually shut it down. - that is also bad thing, (a very bad thing), and from my view point represents what just what I expect from Iomega engineering.4. It's fast - that's good thing.5. It is an Iomega product - that is always bad (but it was a gift, ""I Think"").6. Never install Iomega software or bundled software, it is consistently substandard or just marketing software (Norton Ghost) designed to encourage the purchase of the fully functional product. Just plug it in and let XP find a driver.6. Recommendation: if and only if it is a gift - take it, but beware of ""friends"" bestowing (Iomega) gifts."
1,Contrary to the Contrary Review on Power Switch.,"Yes, it has a power switch, but it doesn't work!!!!"
3,BEWARE - Good BUT,"Save lots of money by purchasing this product. Note that as directed, I cut the strip right down the middle of the red line (for my 22-44 machine) only to find that the strip was 2-3"" too short and had to be thrown away. I measured against the strip that came with my machine and confirmed that the strips were not properly marked - at least on this particular lot. Now have to measure each strip before cutting. This is an example of a poor execution of a great idea.Otherwise, happy with product."
2,Cut lines don't match up,"I got this for the convenience of the premarked cutlines and they are too short. The box recommends cutting two inches off the taper before wrapping. I chose to ingnore that and am glad that I did. Had I done that there's no way it would have covered the drum. As it is I had to leave spacing of about 1/16-1/8"" between each wrap just to get the thing close to covering the drum. It dumbfounds me that they'd sell this product as ""ready to cut"" but then not space the lines correctly. I'll just ignore the lines altogether and use a template to cut the rest of these."
4,Their Best Album,"Not many people know about them or like them if they do but this is one of their best albums in my book. This is your sword and sorcery band from the '80s with good guitars, reasonable drums, and a pretty strong lead singer with a powerful melodic voice. Although simpler in musical arrangement, if you like Mercyful Fate's lyrics then you will enjoy those on this album. I like every single song on this album."
4,3.5... too short,"This cd didnt age that well. i loved it in the 80's but just bought it recently and am a bit disappointed.""Blood of My.."", ""Each dawn I die"", ""Army of the.."" are all good tunes. But the length of the cd (just over 30 minutes) and the mess call ""Black Arrows"" are really disconcerning. They should have at least boosted this cds potential by adding some live trax or something. I mean your really only getting 6 tracks here.The thing is, back in the 80's this was different. But now it sounds more or less tired and lyrically its pretty cheesy.Want the best Manowar? Get ""Into Glory Ride"" for its awesome raw sound and get ""Hell on Wheels live"" for a good sounding reproduction of some of these tracks and several other classics. This cd is still quite good for its time, just didnt age as well as some others. No xtras makes this dismal."
2,"Another letdown, but improving","This, Manowars third album, is better than Into Glory Ride, but Manowar still seems to be struggling to find their place in the metal scene. With songs pertaining to Satanism, they come across like any other band of the time. Still, I actually liked Bridge of Death, minus the silly Satan thing. For me, Manowar will always be about battle, conflict and victory. And this albums first song, Blood of my Enemies shows what Manowar is really capable of (even though it still pales in comparison to songs from Kings of Metal and on). The rest of the album comes across as much of an extension of Into Glory Ride. Rushed, chaotic songs that sound horrible. There is no power, no majesty to these songs, and while it is most likely worth listening to just to hear Eric Adams vocals, if you're not a die hard Manowar fan like me who has to have every single recording, don't bother with this... Get Kings of Metal or Triumph of Steel."
2,Manowars Weakest Effort!!,"I Love Manowar, but this album just doesn't get itdone! The only song on this album that really hits homeis ""Blood of my Enemies"", although I do like the axe-workon ""Black Arrows"". The rest of the songs just don't havethe metal intensity that I'm used to hearing from Manowar.Their raw talent does shine through in moments on this album,but I think the album is poorly produced!To review this album on the basis of their concepts orimage is a mistake, this is why the mainstream music industryin America is so corrupted and fake!The universal message ofManowars music is always the same and unless you are a truemusical person, you probably won't get it!!Even though thisis my least favorite by Manowar, I still think this is a pagein Manowars book that should be read!"
2,DUmb,"This band is so silly. OF course they can play, but the overall concept of the guys ruins wahtever quality they might possess."
5,Killing With Power,"By far my favorite Manowar album, Hail To England is pure driving tunes all the way. Turn it up, roll down the windows and sing along madly with this masterpeace. Every track on this album smokes like a full house of college kids in a coffee shop. The boys back up their ""death to false metal"" exclamations with true powerful metal. ""Blood Of My Enemies"" and ""Each Dawn I Die"" are incredible jump around like a madman tunes. ""Kill With Power"" and ""Army Of Immortals"" roll along brilliantly crushing anything weaker under it's wheels. Bludgeoning riffs, energetic, piercing vocals, ""Hail To England"" is a true adrenaline rush for metal junkies everywhere. So, what are you waiting for?"
2,Overrated,"I liked this stuff in the late 80's when I was in high school. I found the tape that I bought years ago and listened to it a few days back. I could not believe that I liked this back in the day. First off, the lyrics are silly. Honestly, they could have been written by a 12 year old. Secondly the music comes off as unoriginal. There is nothing that jumps out at you and makes you go ""wow"". Lastly, the Black Arrows of Death is one of the worst things ever recorded. It starts of with a rant that end with the line ""let each note be a black arrow of death shot straight to the heart of those that play false metal"" or something like that. Uhgggg. That is followed by one of the worst solos ever to grace an album. There is no melody to it. There is no structure. It is almost like they decided to play as many notes as possible in a fixed time. Absolute garbage. I no longer understand how anyone can take this band seriously."
1,Not Something I Will Be Able to Use!,"I had high expectations of this CD after reading the reviews---in fact, that is the only reason I bought it for my massage office. It is so irritating to me I had to turn it off! Depressing, melancholy, droning, sounds ""draggy"". The track with the rain on it is also irritating. I would never play this CD during a massage!"
1,Off-putting Sythesized Sound,"I was dissapointed in this CD after reading so many wonderful reviews of it. I found the heavy reliance on an almost avant garde synthesized sound to very unrelaxing and actually tension producing. Most CDs now allow you to preview the tracks, this one did not, and of course CDs are nonreturnable so I am stuck with something I can not listen to. Learn from my lesson and never buy a CD if you can't preview the tracks."
5,Relaxing Music,"I have other ""relaxing"" CDs that really don't do the job. This one does. I actually bought it to listen to while I had some dental work done and it was very helpful!"
4,Changing one heart at a time,"As with #1 in this series, it is a lovely reading experience. Strong, capable females, believable characters and situations, and always illustrating the beauty and value of a changed heart."
4,Good,This is not my favorite series by Tracie and Im not sure why. This was a pretty good book with a nice ending.
4,"Good condition, fast service","Thanks for sending so quickly. The book was in good condition as described. However, packaging was torn during shipping and book was exposed on corner."
3,"good, average book","This is a goo, solid, but average book. A good quick read with interesting characters and a story that builds up steam as it goes. A little like Elmore Leonard. If you need a book for a flight or for a doctors office visit, get this one."
1,"generic record, generic review","This cd is so bad, I will make my effort to this review equally so. This cd is a joke."
3,Kid Rock expresses himself,I bought this album for the song All Summer Long. I am sure alot of people did the same. If this is the only reason you are buying the cd I suggest you purchase the single. Music is both art and self expression and Kid Rock is entitled to make any kind of cd he wanted. There are few songs that are similar to All Summer Long but there are a few that are just the opposite that deserve the parental advisory label. Kid Rock is not required to cater to anyone but himself and this album is the album he wanted to put out. At the same time some of his songs may turn people off.
4,Lenny Kravitz in an alternate universe.......the guy has talent,"Kid Rock seems to have finally focused on what sound he wants to go with for the future. Heavily 70's and SouthernRock influenced, with of course the country mixed in lightly...not much in the way of Rap on here. The guy is talented, if it's not your cup of tea. Basically like a Lenny Kravitz type of release, with variety transitioning smoothly between songs. I'd highly recomend the new Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded Cd for a bit heavier experience, but killer CD as well.All That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)"
4,Kid Rocks,"Kid Rock is no Jesus, but a minor demi-god? Sure. This one show his development from Southern Rapper to singer from the south with rap roots. If you liked him before you won't be disappointed. If hot, maybe this will change your mind."
4,Very good mix of several types of music.,"I so far like what I have heard from Kid Rock. The only thing I am not real thrilled with is the hiphop infusion, but it is not overly used. I can live with it to listen to what is a very talented entertainer. I have purchased 3 of his CD's so far, and am not disappointed."
2,"You're Kidding, right?","I admit I had unjustified high expectations. Too much live video, too many Citizen Soldier showings. But most of this album is lame. 1 maybe 2 good songs, 1 maybe 2 repulsive ones, and the rest just po' white boy hotel lounge filler. Yeah, he's back, but really, it hurts to listen to this."
5,Another great CD,"What can I really say besides Kid Rock just rocks! While I didn't absolutely love ALL the songs on this CD and I didn't actually buy it until I saw that it was only 3.99 on some promo, I do love this CD. I haven't been buying much music lately at all due to the economy so it doesn't really speak volumes that I hadn't bought it until it was super cheap. I am very happy to have it though and very happy to be able to put it on my IPOD now!"
4,Kid Rock's Rock & Roll Side Shines Bright,Kid Rock has found a new direction and I love it. I think that he has the ability to rock and it shows in this CD. I have been a fan for years and really like that he is expanding his art.
2,Rock N Roll Jesus,"I am a huge Kid Rock Fan. I have all of his albums and even some really early stuff.RNR Jesus is junk! I'm sorry to say that this is a sell out album much like Metalicca when they sold out and went soft. The lyrics don't flow, the music is choppy. I am not a fan of this album.RNR Jesus is decent in the beginning but ends weak. Amen is horrible. The only other decent song on the album is the Blues song about New Orleans (not sure of the title).I agree with the person who said this was a production album written for Kid Rock. Waited 3 years for this? Don;t buy the whole album...go to ITunes and buy only 2 songs. I bought the album for $7.99 and I wish I had my $6 back."
2,don't waste your money,"Kid rock should have quit after ""Cocky"". I keep thinking his albums have to get better....but they don't. The last 2 have had no more than 2 hits on them. You can either blame it on him or the recordning industry. Nice, fancy promitions get you to buy a crappy album. The best song ""So hott"" is nothing like any other song on the album."
1,vile,I was shocked to see this guy onthe top 10 list. kid rock is vile and disgusting and the sooner he disappears the better.It's always scary to know we live in a country where people watch wrestling and listen to stuff like this.
2,A very bad album,a very bad album there is no rock on this flop at all kid pebble really shines through on this disaster. Tommy lee hit him harder than any track on this flop. I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK
1,Uhhhh.....NO,So Hott is a good song. That's it. Not the right name for this cd. Also all of this fake public fighting is ridiculous. Please!All of his other cd's are great though.
4,Once again,"Kid has done it again. A fully enjoyable album which is bound to impress some and dismay others. A true KR fan will see his evolution and his heart in this one. Like Kid Rock always says,""If it looks good, you'll see it.If it sounds good, you'll hear it.If it's marketed right, you'll buy it.But...if it's real, you'll feel it.""ROCK ON KID...God bless ya"
4,Pretty good,"The Cd is definitely worth getting if you like Kid Rock, I found about half the songs to be very good, while less so witht the other half."
4,Versatile,"Listen to Devil Without A Cause, then listen to RARJ. Both uniquely great albums in two seemingly different genres by two seemingly different artists. Its a real shame to see that Kid Rock is not given nearly the respect and credit he deserves as a musician. Ask anyone on the street if Kid Rock plays and instrument and odds are they will tell u he's just a white rapper, when in actuality he plays guitar (acoustic and electric), bass, drums, harmonica, and keyboard on all of his albums, and writes nearly all the lyrics as well. I think this album is very good and hopefully will open the eyes of music fans everywhere, not only hip-hop/country fans. Long Live the Kid."
1,Music for the lowest common denominator,"If you like Kid Rock, a review won't keep you from buying another album from talentless trailer-trash like Britney or this man. But at least my review has the chance of bringing this crapfest down from 4 stars."
2,Kid Rock? More like Kid Pop,"This sounds nothing like Kid Rock's earlier work. He (and his band) used to have a hard rock edge. Now he has a Grammy nomination for a Pop performance. Kid Rock completely changed genres after the death of nu-metal. Fans of nu-metal would often fuel sales of many hard rock bands such as Fuel, Kid Rock, Salica, and so on. The death of nu-metal impacted hard rock and many artists didn't make it. I guess Kid Rock (and Saliva) decided to go Pop. This album sounds more like his modern releases and I really don't think that Kid Rock fans (from back in the late 1990's) are going to like this album. Modern radio rock/pop fans will love this album as it fits right in with EVERYTHING that is getting released these days.I wouldn't spend the $3.99 on this album as I am a Kid Rock fan of old."
2,Just not that good...,"I am a big Kid Rock fan; however, I was very disappointed with this album. It is obvious that he is trying to pay respects to his heroes while solidifying his own spot in the rock and roll world. However, it just ends up sounding like he is copying those who came before him. There are a couple of decent songs, and some with decent lyrics, but nothing that stands out or has the punch of any of his hit singles. Skip this one and go back to his earlier work."
1,"Kid Rock-""Searching For A Career"" Tonight On VH1 @ 8 PM.","Contrived rock for the masses and dreck at that. What a hilarious title from rock's most untalented poseur.Piss-poor songwriting from a guy who couldn't sing a note if Hank Williams kicked him in the nuts. Cliche' riffs and rants from a man who thought Pamela Ann was a good girl. And that staged fight with Tommy Lee? Stealing riffs from Sweet Home Alabama? Dude, you have really hit a low point. I got some great titles for your next album....how about ""Southern Sell-Out"" or ""Suppressed By The Man"" or your magnum opus ""Hepatitis Rocks!"".Kid, you might do better just hanging at the poolside drinking beer smiling for the photo-op's. I smell a dying career..........."
5,Substance Abuse,"This cd is an abuse of Substance! I LOVE IT ! Kid Rock grows with us and takes us along for the ride. Rock'n Roll Jesus is awesome! Amen is heartbreakingly true. All Summer Long takes us outside, remembering how we used to enjoy the evenings hanging out in cars, at parks & lakes, long before the Internet! (This song takes me back to a better time~Eastwood Lake!) The show at the Taft in Cincinnati was great as well -can't wait for the Arena tour. Rock'n Roll Jesus -Testify, It's a Rock Revival! I've missed him so much, and I'm damn glad he's back! Love ya Rock!"
2,Not Impressed :o(,"I like Kid Rock, but this is the same old stuff. Not anything I want to listen to in the car or carry anywhere. Hopefully he'll snap out of it."
5,The Kid at His Best,Love Love Love this cd traditional Kid Rock music!!!!Yes the lyrics are explicit but that's what you get with the kid
5,Great Album!,"Rock'n'Roll Jesus is a great album filled with hits, the hard rocker ""So Hott"", The southern rock ""All summer long"", The rap rocker ""Sugar"", the future second single ""Roll On"" a great seger types of ballad and more...My favorite album by Kid Rock beside Devil Without a Cause! Buy it you will like it for sure!"
3,Fun but not overwhelming,"I love two songs on this album so much I bought the entire thing just to have them. You can tell he had a little fun making this one because he takes some risks. It is fun to listen to at times but not the definitive rock album. Overall, I do recommend it."
2,blah,"kid rock should have stayed drunk and high. Cause thats what this album sounds like, a fresh-outta-rehab used to be rocker who just found jesus. by far his worst."
5,All Summer Long,"I bought the mp3 for the song All Summer Long but the whole thing is pretty cool. Not typical Kid Rock stuff. I'm 46 and don't like rap crap, but this album isn't like that at all. :)"
5,It's an addicting CD,"All I can say is that this is such a complete piece of work. From begining to end it is just straight forward rock n roll. Kid Rock is a very talanted man. He moves thru so many styles in this one CD. He is a living contradiction in music. That me the appeal to so many people. He relates to the redneck, the soul singer, the southern rocker, the gospel, and the rapper. His live show is just awesome. I was privelidged to see him in the show at the Tabernacle in Atlanta, Ga. It was a extremely small venue ( 2400) for a act like his. He is the consumate showman. He lives what he sings. I love the honesty in this CD.Favorite...All Summer longRock N' Roll JesusLowlife"
1,Pretty bad...,"I just skimmed through this album the other night, borrowed it from my friend.The first thing I wondered is how many of these guitar riffs are complete rip-offs from rock classics?I noted at least 3 songs where the main guitar riff sounds like a slightly altered version of an old rock song.Other than that, this album has a pasteurized corporate sound to it. Kid Rocks adolescent boasting and posturing gets tiresome. The songs that are non ripoffs are the weaker ones on the album, showing the amount of creativity, originality, and talent put into this album- not much.The only thing I will give Kid Crock credit for is he tends to put on a good live show, but that cant cover for mediocre(at best), uninspired music. It's a sad reflection on our culture when throwaway albums like this are lauded as being excellent."
1,WAS EDITED CD!!! SAID THAT IT WASNT WHEN I PURCHASED IT!!! BEWARE!!!,The CD was not suppose to be edited but it was. Then I tried to contact the seller so that I would mail the CD back and get a refund or exchange and the seller would not respond. I tried contacting the seller several times but was not sucessful. SO BEWARE when ordering CDs. If you dont want a edited CD then I would not purchase from this seller.
2,ROCK AND ROLL JESUS,A COUPLE OF GOOD ROCKIN TUNES BUT SINCE IM A COUNTRY GAL I DID NOT CARE FOR THE LANGUAGE IN SOME OF THE RAPS
3,its alright,"it would have helped if there were music clips of the CD to listen to prior to purchasing. Then again, chances are, I wouldn't have bought it if that were the case."
5,"superb, if you can stand a couple raunchy tracks","Probably this CD got labeled with the Parental advisory sticker is because of the songs so Hott & sugar where the music may be a little bit rough for some people. All though there are some language in tracks 11 & the title song. However, don't let some of the language and sexual content discourage you from buying this CD. IF the members at the common [...] would probably put this CD at about 13 to 15 and up so you probably don't want your really young kids to listen to this. However if you are looking for one of those CD's that seem to bend several genres of music, buy this one."
4,Love Kid Rock,"As always Kid Rock nails it.I liked the whole C.D.I would tell my friends to buy this, and ROCK ON!"
2,The CD was not the explicit version.,I ordered the explicit version which is what the photo indicated. I am disappointed that the one I received was the straight version. The CD is still good but I was looking for something to listen to in the car when the kids aren't with me. I saw Kidd Rock in concert and the naughty words make the songs!! Sometimes middle aged people need to let loose a little bit!!
3,Kid Rock CD,"I love ""All Summer Long""Most of the songs are good. A little bit too much ""rated R"" for me."
1,1 Star for 1 Song,"I purchased the entire CD for one song - ""All Summer Long"" - because it was unavailable online as a single. The remaining songs/music were as expected and a waste of money."
4,A SOUTH AMERICAN WEIGHS IN,"Being from Argentina, I often think American writers don't get it right when writing about South or Central America. But this book is really respectful while not shying away from Costa Rica's problems. Plus, it captures the Costa Rica I experienced when I vacationed there 3 years ago.I liked the pictures, too, especially the one taken through a window of an abandoned house, looking up the side of Volcan Irzazu. I gave it 4/5 stars because I wish the photo captions had been on the pages of the photos, but instead they were on a separate page in the back, so I had to keep flipping back and forth. But I guess that's a small thing."
4,Both photography and writing I liked,Both photography and writing I liked. Many facts that (personally) I never knew about Costa Rica was very informative. I would recommend this book everyone.
3,Nice Book,"This is a lovely hardcover book of Costa Rica. Nice Photos and associated text. While it is nice, it is not necessarily spectacular and didn't quite measure up to the retail price."
2,Not a travel book,"I bought this book based on the numerous adulations on this web site. However, as an uptodate travel guide, I found it not -- not worth the money, not a travel guide, not about retirement, not current (copywrite 1993). It is a historial summary of the country, people, flora and fauna. The pages devoted to today's needed travel info ""Modern Times"" were outdated and numbered only from 129-146. It's a nice coffee table book with some beautiful pictures. Buy it for that reason, if you choose to buy it, but not as a travel guide as recommended by another reviewer."
3,yawn,"just another product that makes great claims but is not quite as good as it claims yo be, that's what I think"
4,Powermatic 66 Mobile Base works for me,"Great base, easy to put together and I got the saw into it with only the help of my 14 year old son (tipped the saw up and slid it in). The wheel locks on the table saw base end had two different bolt heads, one had a nice knob which easily turns by hand in against the wheel, the other side had just a hex head which isn't as nice. The extension end has the tab type wheel locks which work fine. Other than that the base is perfect, solid in place when the wheels are locked and mobile when they are not. I'd recommend this base for anyone who needs to move their 66 around in their shop."
5,Solid Base that Matches Powermatic 66 Perfectly,"(...) The correct POWERMATIC picture of this base is at the Powermatic Site. Here is the link to the actual manual for those that want the detail:http://www.powermatic.com/PMWood/Manuals/CurrentManuals/Powermaticmobilebase.pdfThis was built for the Powermatic 66 and says Powermatic on the side. I have the 50"" fence with the matching black extension table and cabinet. Every thing fit perfectly.So what's the difference between this and others. Well if you look at the Jet bases you can see the tubing is smaller and a thinner gauge. Understanding that the Powermatic 66 is the heaviest saw in it's class This base is very beffy compared to the others you'll find. It is all welded with four simple bolts that attach the two sides.If you want a heavy base for the Powermatic 66 don't waste time on anything else - this one works and fits perfectly.Hope that helps you."
4,Woodworker,"Product arrived without damage, which is a stroke of luck given Powermatic's continued refusal to provide adequate packaging for shipment. The unit was shipped in a cardboard box without any packing material for protection. There were two holes punched in the cardboard from the product inside, but fortunately no damage. Reviews by previous purchasers confirm this is not a new issue and some have not been as lucky as me.Regarding the product itself, it appears to be solidly built, however, the wheels are secured from moving by a bolt that presses against a plastic wheel. This will undoubtedly damage the wheel as other previous reviewers have pointed out. I plan on adding some sort of plate between the bolt and wheel to prevent this damage--again something Powermatic should be doing if they really valued their quality image."
3,Powermatic mobile base,"I perchased this stand though a 3rd party vender, got a good deal, however after reading all the reviews I thought the stand would fit my older powermatic 66 perfectly. Not so I had to put 2x4s under the saw so that the dust port at the bottom of the saw would clear the stand. I can only conclude the stand was desighed for a newer model saw. Good solid stand and I got a good price.<*((((><"
4,The Whole Truth,"I bought this cassette when it came out in '87 not knowing heads or tails about the band. And I still don't. I just know that got it for the title track, ""Weapons of Love"" and for that track alone it was worth it. As for the rest of the LP I could live without it. But the first cut rocks..crank the volume and you will see."
3,It Does The Job,"I'm only giving this 3 stars because the description was misleading. It said ""Easily Add Storage to Any System with USB or eSATA"" but there is no eSATA port on it.It wasn't worth the hassle of returning since I needed a USB 2.0 enclosure to use as a Time Machine drive for my Macbook anyway. I'll have to try again on getting an eSATA enclosure to use with my desktop one of these days.Other than not having a port I was looking for, the setup was pretty straightforward. Plug the plugs into the drive, screw it to the caddy, slip the caddy into the enclosure and screw it in. Setting it up for Time Machine under OSX couldn't get much easier."
2,sloppy manufacturing,"There is a big sloppy excessive glob of hardened glue that hold the LED lead into a track. Because it is already a very tight fit to insert the HD into the enclosure, this glob of glue makes it a difficult if not impossible task. I had to carefully pull the LED lead out of the track (breaking the glue seal) and then carefully chip off some of the excess hardened glue before I could install my hard drive into the enclosure. Thereafter all went well and the product works great."
5,6 years and strong!,Had this for at least 6 years. Use it off and on. I still think this is the sexiest external HDD case I have ever seen.
4,NexStar Enclosure for Dish,"I purchased this case to enable me to use unused hard drives with our Dish DVR receiver. Connected to Dish USB, I am able to move instructional (DIY etc) videos and movies from the DVR to the external hard drives, woodworking on one (black), Food network (blue) on another, Sci-Fi (red) on yet another, etc. I am able to unplug one NexStar then plug in another NexStar and Dish recognizes them and I can play back HD movies from the NexStar enclosure - Great enclosures"
2,Not the best drive case,"I purchased this drive case because I was just looking to get data off old hard drives and it was a reasonable price. If you are looking to convert an internal drive to an external USB drive, I would not recommend this case. It seems cheap and not well made. But, if you are just looking to pull data off old hard drives and only use it on occasion, it works just fine. Just make sure to switch the IDE drive to master otherwise it won't power up."
2,Disappointing,"While this hard drive enclosure looks better than most, it's beauty alas is mostly skin deep. When you open up the enclosure, you have two parts, the enclosure itself and the drive cage and circuit board into which you insert your hard drive. It takes quite a bit of force to insert and remove hard drives from the drive cage. A wire for the LED light attaches to a header on the circuit board. As a result when you open up the enclosure to take the drive out, it's easy to accidentally yank the wire for the LED out of place and bend some pins. Worse yet, the drive cage is such a tight fit that I did pop put plastic cover on the power connector. While this doesn't appear to have affect the drive but it speaks poorly for this product's construction."
1,Doesn't work at all,"When my XP system died, I got one of these from the local PC shop to transfer stuff to my new Vista system. The new system has never been able to recognize the drive. I wrote to the company several times, and they say it is Vista compatible without any additional drivers. They made some obvious suggestions like plug it directly into a USB port on the computer, not a hub (I had tried both). It works with two XP systems I've tested on, and my Vista PC reads every other USB drive, flash drive, and memory card I've tried, but this model just won't work with Vista."
1,Didn't work,"I never got the product to work I plugged in both cords from the drive, plugged it into the wall.....nothing. LED would not light up(yes I hooked the wire up) and drive was getting no power and my computer would not recognize the drive. I took everything back apart and put it back together twice and I got nothing. I must have received a bad unit.Sent it back for refund."
5,Get the popcorn!,"This was a hoot but I wish they showed more of the Linda Tripp skits with John Goodman, those were some of the best!"
2,...,"These grenades are made entirely of plastic, they don't pour the bb's very well, and they don't really look all that real. These are great if you don't know what a real grenade looks or feels like. I was hoping to hang these on my belt. I thought they would look really awesome, but because of the spring underneath the handle, they can't really stay and they always fall off. I just gave them to my 10-year old brother and he loves them. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who is really serious about airsoft."
3,"Considering the ""Cheerleader"" series, this book, written by","Considering the ""Cheerleader"" series, (from the mid-1980's), this book, written by the now popular Christopher Pike is acceptable. What Pike fans need to remember is that the young adult genre was not as varied and as open then as it is now. Pike wrote a book that was mediocre, but the entire series is less than mediocre--so that is A-OK! I originally read this book when it was published (as a seventh or eighth grader) and continue to read Pike to this day."
3,ok but not his best,Its an OK book considering its his second published work. It sounds like he threw it together quickly and didnt think a lot about it. If you want to read a really awesome book by him read The Midnight Club
4,Ok Jacket,"I bought this jacket for my husband a couple of years ago. It's a great jacket, but I'd suggest getting one in a smaller size. I bought this one in a small, but when we got it, it was huge and not small at all. Not sure it was worth the money I spent on it, but I guess you're paying for the name on it rather then the jacket."
5,Recomended,"I've had this for about ten years, now. It works great. The only problem is the non-stainless steel parts. I've had to replace the lava rock pan and burner assembly twice, and I've just ordered new ones. the la st ime I ordered them from Brinkmann, it took over a month to get the parts, and customer service was a disaster. I finally had to go throught he parent company(Remington Firearms) in order to get my parts."
5,The heilegen Shlomo,"Whatever Shlomo sings it lifts the soul. He is one of those special kind of singers like Louie Armstrong, and Bob Dylan who do not have 'good voices' but whose voice is a great voice, nonetheless. This is because with Shlomo it comes from the deepest Jewish soul. And what goes out from the soul enters the soul."
5,Love it!,"I bought this DVD at the suggestion of one of my friends and is great; my son is very very active so trying to sit down and teach him this signs was out of the question, and this DVD is just awesome it keeps his attention and is fun! He could sign milk in 3 days."
5,BABY Signing Time is BEST for BABY!,"[...] has developed a series for babies under the age of 1 called, appropriately enough, ""Baby Signing Time"". This version integrates cartoon with real children, and LOTS of singing and dancing, which holds an 8 month old's attention well."
5,baby signing time is great,"My daughter wasn't sure about this at first and ignored it the first time we watched, but now she is obsessed with it and so proud of herself when she makes the signs herself. These are great dvds and my daughter loves to dance to the songs as well!"
2,Too fast pace!,"The video moves way too fast and the signing is distracting. It may be good for toddlers, but not for younger babies."
5,Perfect for new signers!!,"I bought this DVD for my 11 month old, even though I've been signing with her since early infancy. She LOVES it! She's picked up more signs in the short time we've had this video, than with just her and I signing over the last several months. She loves to see the other babies/toddlers signing and the songs are great. It's also very short (about 20 minutes), so it's just the perfect length for little ones (not too much TV time!). This is a must have for anyone interested in teaching thier child to sign. My daughter is now 12 months and can sign: more, eat, drink, banana, dog, finished, milk, ball, baby and bath."
1,Babies Should not Wach Videos According to the American Pediatric Association,"Babies Should not Wach Videos According to the American Pediatric Association. Ask your doctor. There is no educational benefit to be gleaned from watching a video for a baby under two years old. Don't waste your money. I think these videos are great, but not for babies."
5,Lessons work,"My daughter was able to start communicating with us early (~7 months) with 'more' then 'all done'. She then picked up 'eat', 'drink', and 'hurt'. Pretty cool to see her learn and communicate without words. She also digs the music."
4,Fun and entertaining,"I have been playing the DVD for my son since August 15 and he loves the music and songs. While he hasn't done any signing like the babies in the show, I can tell he understands when I sign for him and he is definitely gesturing more than he did before. The songs are catchy, which is good and bad because they can sometimes get stuck in your head. I haven't tried any other baby sign DVDs, but his came highly recommended by other moms I know. In terms of production quality it's well-done and easy to follow."
3,More words please??,"After watching this video once, I did like how simple the signs were, especially for the little ones. However, I had higher hopes that there would be more than 25 words. Yes, those words are very important, but I thought there would be more levels, I suppose, with more words.That being said, I definitely recommend this for a one year old. It is a repetitive 25 min, although the DVD said 40+ min. Good starting off point."
5,Awesome and catchy,"I started signing to my son since he was born. At 13 months he never signed back to me. I bought this video and BAM! He is signing. He loves watching this video (Then again it is the only tv/dvd we let him watch) Buy it if you want to introduce basic signing words such as milk, more, eat, juice, mom, dad etc."
5,Best baby DVD's ever...,"Both my husband and I absolutely love the Baby Signing Time DVD's! We have been showing the DVD's to our daughter starting when she was about 6 months. We only watched them a couple times a week but at a year old she is using many of the signs with meaning. Previous to a year she sometimes did the signs but we weren't sure if she meant anything by them. Sign language is a great way for them to communicate before they can say words to you. Even if you don't care about them learning the sign language, the music and pictures are really good and entertaining for children. After watching these DVDs, other baby DVD's are a disappointment. As soon as my daughter hears the opening theme song she immediately smiles and gets excited, making the sign for ""baby"" like they do in the opening song. I highly recommend these DVD's. You don't need any other DVD's in the house for your baby other than these!"
3,It's ok,"I haven't used any other DVDs so I have no point of reference, but I bought this for my 8 month old and maybe he has ADD, but he got bored of it after the first few minutes. I thought the 1st chapter was really relevant (eating & drinking), but the other chapters weren't very useful to us (animals, grandparents--his grandparents live far away and he doesn't know them, diaper dance--i guess this is useful, but the whole chapter just taught one sign). The eating and drinking chapter is too long for him and the others are really short. We play 1-2 chapters for him once per week and he can't sit still for it. I do like how they have babies doing the signs so you can see different variations. I'm hoping as he gets older, he'll show us that he has absorbed something and will sign back to us when we sign."
5,My baby LOVES Baby Signing Time!,"My son doesn't care for T.V., but he loves baby signing time, and has learned so many signs from this movie. It's great because he doesn't talk yet, but he can tell me when he's hungry, and so many other things we can communicate we couldn't before. Even without watching the movie, we can sing the songs and he knows the signs that go along with them. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
4,Parent Participation,"This is my first signing time video, and my daughter is 10 months old. Much to my surprise, as my daughter's first DVD, my daughter *does not* watch the TV when this video is on because she doesn't understand TV yet (probably a good thing), so this experience has really been about me learning the songs and the signs, and then singing the songs with her and doing the signs with her -- which is probably the most effective approach anyway. Only down side: I don't think the cartoons add anything to this video. The kids doing signs is very valuable -- it helps to see that not all kids get every sign as clear as a parent will, but that it doesn't matter!!"
4,Should be a longer DVD for the price,I think this DVD should have more chapters for the price- other than that it is fine. I don't think I will be buying the other volumes.
5,"Great, great entertainment!","My 15-month and 3 year-old love this DVD. So fun and entertaining. Great beginner signs...helps speed the communication between child and parent, even if neither has a hearing loss."
4,Very helpful.,"This was a good intro to signing and the signs that were chosen were very helpful. This made for a good signing foundation. We also liked the 2nd volume. I have to say it taught me more than my son, but allowed me, in turn, to teach him. It only works well if you use the signs in everyday speech."
5,we have rented this item at least 10 times!,"Worth every penny, my daughter loves it more than any other video and we have both learned a lot...I agree with other review, PLEASE sell this on instant!! We purchased the volume available for sale but this one is the best!"
4,So much fun!,"I'm an ASL minor, and I wanted my son to learn some ASL as well. I show him signs, but the video is great at reiterating what I""m showing him! The only thing is that I wish they showed more on each DVD."
3,Baby Signing Time vs Signing Time,"We checked both Baby Signing Time & Signing Time out of the library before buying. Our daughter 5 month old at the time seemed to enjoy both. The reason why I would lean toward Signing Time as opposed to Baby Signing Time (BST) is that the latter (BST) uses younger children (toddlers) to demonstrate the signs. The demonstrations therefore aren't as 'exact' so I questionned whether our daughter would really learn the signs...The tunes in BST are catchy though...I found myself humming one of the tunes several days later while on a business trip....Either way, I'm sure you can't go wrong. (we did decide to order the regular signing time dvd)"
2,Spastic. More hyperactive entertainment than education,"I bought this after borrowing the original (before it was remade) Signing Time from the library. (Rachel in her red sweater with long hair.) I loved the original Signing Time. It was educational, calm and still entertaining. I got Baby Signing Time thinking it would be similar, but with signs more specific for a baby. But, Baby Signing Time is distracting and spastic. The signs are buried under so much extraneous movement, color, scene-shifts, music, etc, that the video's educational value is questionable.This is the hyperactive, short-attention-span-encouraging, cutesy stuff that I did not want to expose my child to.I much preferred the low-budget, real people, original Signing Time. Unfortunately, I don't know if it's even possible to get that anymore."
5,We love Baby Signing Time!,"I highly recommend Baby Signing Time Vol. 1 and 2! My son is 14 months old and we've been watching this series off and on since he was about 6 months. The songs are awesome and I love to sing along with them. We sing the songs even when the DVD is not playing and he lights up and smiles when I start singing and signing. His first sign at about 9 months of age was ""more"". And he is picking up more signs the more we watch the DVD. I was trying to use the signs frequently in our day to day interactions, but he signs more after watching the videos. He loves watching the video and smiles everytime he sees the DVD case. He has started sitting down in front of the TV to let me know he wants to watch it. Very highly recommended!"
5,My son loves it!,"My 18-month-old son LOVES this DVD. He has learned all the signs, so I am on Amazon looking for more volumes to buy. He has learned the signs so quickly, and this morning when my mom came over, he pulled out the picture chart so he could sit there and point at each picture and show us the sign for it (cat, horse, cracker, etc. etc.). So great!"
5,Baby Signing Time review,"The video is cool, the lady is a little annoying, but it's for kids and it's set to music and it DOES get stuck in your head. It's pretty effective though. And I don't know about my daughter, but I'VE learned new signs hahaha."
4,Baby signing a real breakthrough,This is a book that would probably assist most young parents or anyone working with the hearing impared. It is clear and quite comprehensive.
1,Dreadful!,"I haven't seen the original version of this DVD - I hope it's as good as other reviewers have said. This one is dreadful! The silly graphics and babyish songs are very distracting and irritating. Even worse, the children look unhappy and uncomfortable - are they not shown with their parents? ""Sign With Your Baby"" is so much better!"
5,By far the best!,"These dvd series are the only thing that will hold my child (14 month) attention. He is learning so much. An added bonus is I am learning also. Now he even requests by signing that he wants to watch baby signing time by signing baby. He does that about a ""million"" times a day or at least it seems. Very educational and fun!"
5,My kids love it,My daughter recieved this DVD from her Grandma. She loves to watch it over and over. She know all the signs that are on this video. I am teaching my 7 month old by watching these videos. I think it's great. I recommend this for any parent of small children.
5,Great Signing Video,Our four children all enjoy the Signing Time videos. Great songs and many common signs. We have watched them to help prompt speech. Very child friendly.
4,Good DVD but the songs can get annoying.,"My baby is only 6 months so its probably too early to expect him to start signing just now. The songs are great and easy to remember and sing along. However, I find myself singing them in my sleep if we listen to them too much so I just have to be careful for my sake how much we watch it. Will have to let you know in the future if he learns the signs or not."
5,Fantastic!,Will help your toddler communicate and encourage speech! Perfect for increasing both receptive and expressive vocabulary. The songs are fun to sing with the signs!!
5,Excellent,"My 13 month old loves this DVD. After seeing it a few times, she really has started signing. She loves the songs and the other babies. I don't let her watch much television, but this is such a sweet and educational DVD that I don't worry about her watching it at all. Best of all, it makes her smile and giggle."
3,Enjoyable adventure with a lot of humor,"This movie continues Indy's service in the Belgian army during the Great War.Young Indy takes to the air as a combat photographer with the Layfayette Escadrille (French fighter squadron manned by American volunteers), and is sent behind enemy lines as a courier/spy for the allies of WW1.Indiana Jones once again is forced to outwit the Germans."
2,Best of the Young Indy series,"I've seen all of the Young Indiana Jones episodes and have been mostly disappointed by the blatant rip-offs of everything from The Great Escape to The Lighthorsemen. But this episode was actually fun,with plenty of colorful characters (the Red Baron, Anthony Fokker, Hermann Goehring)and good-looking men in pretty uniforms pulling off bad accents. As usual, Indy is completely upstaged by the famous real-life characters he comes across, which is one of the series' major faults. Cheesey,but fun."
3,"Ride is always Ride, or?","Well, I've always loved Ride. But this is an album that is far from the 5 star cucumber eyes album Leave them all behind. But of course it's a must for all fans. /Tomas Rendalen"
5,My parents have been annoyed ever since!,"Well, I can safely say I've now heard everything. My ears, still intact, strangely enjoyed this quaint little [though thirty-five tracks long] collection. My personal favorite: The ""Up came oil "" song. It sounds like something from the Simpsons.By, the way, give the ""pirahna man"" a few chances. He grows on you."
3,My feet were black,"I ordered this shoe in black and it dyed my feet black. It is super cute, but I would caution you that this may happen. The color washed off of course, but was quite a surprise when I took them off after wearing them."
4,Good DVD overall,"I bought this for the song ""Singin' with the Saints."" There are versions of this Utube and I preferred this version. (Guy has an orange shirt.) I found and bought it. I cannot say that I like all the songs. There are three in a row that I do not care much for; However, overall, I do like this DVD.The Singin' With the Saints song is fun, and there is another song that touched me so much that it made me cry. Now, I am not a Western fan and never bought a Roy Acuff record in my life, but I know who he was. and heard him sing when I was growning up. Gloria tells a little story about him, which is followed by Jake Hess with a related song, and it is a beautiful thing to watch. The song is titled: ""I Know Where I Am."" It could not be lovlier.So, in spite of the skipping I may do in the future, I will be listening to this DVD many times more. I definitely recommend it. And some of you will like those songs that I skip, ~so you might keep this in mind.Mickey Thorne"
1,"Nature thins are great , this box EXPIRES in 30 days!","I bought a CASE, they expire in one month. They taste great, But SHAME on AMAZON. I also bough Butter Rounds, they expired LAST YEAR."
5,yummie!,"These crackers are delicious! But the price is average. My local Publix (Florida supermarket) has them every day for 2.49 and drops them on sale about every 3 months. While I love these, the price (at least for now) isn't impressive."
5,a great book,"The Mick was a very good book. It showed a great insight of the life of Mickey Mantle, one of the best baseball players ever to live. He told about his views on life and baseball."
2,"Too Much? Try ""Not Enough""","I was ready for something very interesting when I ordered ""Eros"". What I ended up getting was something utterly underwhelming.I can't say it's generic, I guess. In fact, it's technically quite unique. There's something wrong, though. Something missing. Sure it's dark and edgy, but it's also quite dull. Too many of the songs sound alike. This type of consistency works for some albums, but I think in Violent Green's case, a more colorful palette could have been used.It could just be that I can't stand those gruff, ugly vocals!It should be noted that the first song, ""Land"", an apparent tribute to Patti Smith, is very good."
5,The Homeboy,"The Homeboy is full of excitement and sadness, detailing the life of its author, Rev. Dr. Clark Hobby. Growing up in ""The Home"" at Hershey Industrial School, Hobby relects the mischievous and fun times as well as the melancholy separation of his birth family.Very well written, this book will make one laugh at times and cry during others."
1,Eh...reads like Cliffnotes,"If you're looking for something extra in the Dark Tower world, you won't find it here. After reading all seven books over the last two years, I was interested in seeing if I'd missed anything. Nothing new here. It's basically a summation of what the seven books are about. It's also tedious reading with all the footnotes. Yuck. The Concordance book is MUCH better. Also, the writing here is kind of awkward in places. It seems to be that they gave the first guy to come along the job of writing this book, instead of someone who really know what they're talking about."
1,Great for those fans that are completely lost but...,... for those with any intelligence what so ever a pointless read. Vincent points out all of the obvious connections to Kings other works. There was no interview with the author to speak of... There was no new insight into the characters or about the worlds. Disappointing through and through.
1,The Road to the Dark Tower. Exploring Stephen King's Magnum Opus - A BIG GYP!,"I don't think Mr. Vincent has read S. King's works on the DT in depth. Frankly, I believe he has plagerised R.H. Concordance, be it her first two versions or the second. He just doesn't get it. I have said it before, and I'll say it again, mayhap he should look deeper into what S.K. is trying to transmit in the DT series. It seems to me he's off in another multiverse. May the god's help him because he definity needs it. Don't buy this book under any circumstances. This jerk is pulling yr. leg. One acception, he does list all the F&SF magaizines where S.K. has been published. So what? How do you get hold of this info. without a mountain of research (and probably a mountain of money?). Not worth yr. while. R.H. Condorces are sufficient. This guy (Vicent) is still trying to make some money with VERY little knowledge and understanding of the DT series. Yuk! Makes me sick to my stomach,money gubging sob."
3,The Road To The Dark Tower: Exploring Stephen King's Magnum Opus,"Not a bad read for the Tower Junkie. There are just a few factual errors in this book, but I don't want to put any spoilers up here. Bev Vincent gets it MOSTLY right, but the errors stand out to someone who has read this series a few times.On the plus side, he points out a few other bits of information that are correct, and interesting to boot!Don't read this book until you have finished reading The Dark Tower series first. This book is not as exhaustively comprehensive as ""The Dark Tower: A Concordance"", by Robin Furth, which I also recommend for the serious Dark Tower Junkie."
5,Wonderful insights!,"I love this book of Selected Letters because of the insights each letter gives into the character of Charles Dodgson. I've admired the ""Alice"" books for years, and after reading these letters, I feel like I've had the chance to make the acquaintance of the author. Delightful reading!"
3,Good functionality with minor problems,"As an external hard drive it works fine, espically for the price; I paid one hundred fifty at a local store. No noise or anything so far :) It just sits there, and shows up as another drive, no big deal.I have two complaints though: the manual is totally worthless. This normally wouldn't bother me too much, but this is actually the worst manual I've seen. Not helpful at all. You have to use thier web support (which is actually pretty good, and free), as the manual doesn't explain anything.Also, the power button is located in the back of the unit, rather than on front or up top, where it would be easier to get to.Other than that, it's a good drive, particularly at less than a dollar a gigabyte. Great portable storage to have, great for backups, etc. and the bundled Norton Ghost is great. It's got the functionality of an external hard drive for a very good price."
2,Don't buy this.,"Mine didn't make any noise, but if you even *touched* the cable while it was running, the drive would momentarily lose power and the operation would fail. The drive would take 30 seconds to recover.Ordinarily, I'm very patient with my devices, but I returned this the same day."
5,Iomega 160 GB External Hard Drive (33082),"I bought this driver for a very good price at OfficeMax. It is easy to use. Just connect to USB of your PC and you are ready. No need to look at the manual. However, it takes time to transfer a big volume to this hard driver when you use USB1.1. It took more than 3 hours to transfer the volume of my 3 DVDs in the old laptop. I have a USB key Sandisk 512 MB but this driver by far is more convenient. Quiet and cool design. The power button only works when you disconnect the driver from the PC. It lacks of a network card if you want to use in your home wireless network.It is a good product and I highly recommend."
5,excellent hard drive - what is everyone talking about?,"There's no cat meow. It still works fine when I touch the cable. You don't even need the manual, just connect the USB cable and it shows up. I think everyone else is a bit too picky, but this hard drive is awesome, especially for the price. I paid $140 for a 160GB, at < $1/GB this doesn't get any better. Very simple to use, don't even need any tech support or any manual. Have no doubts about this, great product."
2,Very disappointed,"Given the # of good reviews, I bought the 160 GB and am in Day 3 of trying to get it to work. Part of that time was 24 hours of THINKING that it was working (blue light flashing, pop-up window reporting that files were being transferred), but I don't think that the drive would ever have stopped. When I finally tried to Cancel the operation; it hung my computer (couldn't CTRL-ALT-DEL it; I couldn't even turn the computer off -- I had to unplug the computer!; then, it took 2 tries to get it to boot up again correctly). I will spend some MORE time on the support web site; the ""manual"" is indeed useless & apparently inaccurate. I'm afraid that I have a lemon here."
2,Expensive. Thought It was a three-pack.,"Beware! Don't buy solely with your eyes. According to the picture, I thought there were 3 pairs included, but it was only a single pair. Very expensive for a 1/2 ounce of fabric!"
2,Misleading & false advertising,"This product is very misleading. The picture shows 3 but you only get one. That needs to be stated in the description. If that's not false advertising, I don't know what is. I will NEVER buy anything that says Calvin Klein again. Total rip-off!!!!"
5,Bobby Susser Made The Greatest Early Childhood Sing-Along,"The repetition of the choruses in these songs, the catchy and easy to learn lyrics and melodies, themes that interest young ones, great music and singing, and Bobby Susser's unique touch to every song has quickly made this the favorite sing-along with my kindergarten class. Once you sing these songs you just can't stop. They are fun, interesting, and informative. Having these qualities in a sing-along of thirteen original songs is pretty special. Bobby Susser doesn't let you down for one minute. The children start singing right away, and keep on singing and singing. I think that this is the greatest early childhood sing-along."
5,Nothing Measures Up To This EARLY LEARNING SING-ALONG,"With upbeat songs, easy to learn catchy choruses, very enthusiastic vocal performances, and the most appealing orchestrations, this sing-along with a collection of thirteen Bobby Susser songs should be at the top of the list of sing-alongs for young children. Songs like ""I'm Happy"" and ""It's Raining, It's Pouring, And I'm Wet"" grab the attention of my entire first grade class. All these songs are fun, and simple so the children can jump right in and enjoy themselves, and learn at the same time. There is such cleverness exhibited here because positive adult values, as well as good habits, and social ways are taught, but the music, melodies, and lyrics are so terrific for kids that a sing-along is literally created every time you play each song. The result is that my kids learn so much and love to sing these songs. I predict this sing-along will be a classic, and sung over and over by future generations of young children."
2,Parts missing instructions vague,"Very disappointed in the quality of this item. Many missing parts.Instruction do not have a exploded viev of parts list so you can't inventory the part before you start assembly. I have purchased HTC products in the past, this is the first time I have ever had a problem. Now I wait for a response from them.They have no known direct website to support there customers."
4,Excellent,This book is excellent for building an inexpensive all terraine vehicle. There are even update pages sent on a regular basis for those who have taken the time to register with the included registration page. I had not problems duplicating the ATV. Thanks
5,Great book but needs a glossary!,"I thought this book was great the first time around, and now, years later, I not only still think it's a great book, but it's become scarily relevant. I live in the Western US where environmental decisions by people who live far away are wreaking havoc with personal property rights and local economics. We counter their arguments with science, but it doesn't matter.Fallen Angels goes on my bookshelf next to Orwell's 1984 and Doctorov's Little Brother for fiction that is becoming uncomfortably close to fact."
5,Great Book,"I picked up this book because this is probably one of the best pieces of ""fun to read"" sci-fi I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It's a collaborative work... but it turns out nicely. Basically... it's a sci-fi pulp... but one put together by several very good sci-fi authors... and in the end... it feels like an all-star movie... maybe like a Pulp-Fiction but a sci-fi version (I know... this is a totally different thing... but bear with me). It has the feel of so many unique characters and so many crazy happenings that... somehow... it just feels plausible. The characters feel real. They behave like normal people would behave. I guess what I'm trying to say... is that they're some what humorous. It's a great read. And I'd recommend anyone looking to just enjoy a good read."
3,"A stretch, but fun","I never thought much of it, but when I ended up working for Rotary Rocket, I couldn't resist getting my copy autographed by the authors *and* Gary Hudson- at the rollout of the Roton ATV. Of course, Gary detests the book, so maybe that's why I got fired last week ;) Turn your willing suspension of disbelief way up and you'll enjoy it.-- Doug Jones, Rocket Plumber"
3,"A love letter to the fans, those hardcore book-buyers","This book didn't get a good reception critically when it came out, mostly because the critics didn't like the ""SF Fandom _rules,_ the mundane world _drools_"" subtext. I found it a bit over-the-top myself, as I don't like being bludgeoned over the head with a Message in my fiction, even one that I agree with...but I liked the book. A lot of people have complained that this book paints fans in too flattering of a light. Granted, but they're supposed to be the heroes, and I've often wondered: Why is it that someone who's a stone fanatic about, forex, professional football-watching, is considered perfectly normal, no matter how much this hobby distorts his life---while SF fans are considered geeks and nerds?"
3,"Interesting Idea, especially today, but not well written","While the idea of a green government destroying Americans rights and liberties is a very interesting idea especially during the debate on global warming, I found the writing and the character development to be too rigid and difficult to get into. You always felt like you were reading a story and couldn't get engrossed into it like you would a good novel."
3,Global cooling rules!,"A tongue in cheek novel that looks at mankind's response to a new ice age while still fixated on solving global warming and minimizing science and technology. Also a novel about Science Fiction fandom, most of which went right over my head."
3,"Mind-candy, unabashed fan service","If you're in SF fandom at all, and you like fan service, you'll like this book. If you're in midwest fandom, you'll probably even recognize people. It's a quick read and worth it for that I guess.Goofy story and IIRC almost a deux ex machina ending (it's been a year or so since I read this). Nothing in this book is going to make you think much."
2,Underground Trekkies,"I love the premise of the book- what happens when environmentalists get crazy and start an ice age, but the authors, all three great, could have done so much better. The idea that a bunch of underground science fiction fans being hunted by the government are helping the ""space people"" in the midst of Luddite oppression is just assinine. If you are not a hard-core science fiction buff, with enough knowledge of the genre to be able to sweep the category on the game show Jeopardy, don't bother reading this book. Like their real-world counterparts, most of the characters in this book are a bunch of weenies, and the obscure references to sci-fi of the past are tedious and sleep-inducing."
3,Niven and Pournelle give fanservice,"A dated book, and definitely not Niven and Pournelle's best. Instead of global warming, the Earth is being covered by glaciers, thanks to those silly environmentalists and all their anti-pollution laws, which literally reversed the Greenhouse Effect. Two astronauts from the space habitats still orbiting the Earth are shot down over North America, and have to be rescued, by sci-fi fans. (Hah, see me use ""sci-fi"" deliberately just to annoy all the SF pedantists?) Half ego-fluffing for SF fandom, half polemic against environmental laws and politicians who cut the budget for the space program, this novel read like ranty fan fiction, and the writing, honestly, was not much better. I gave it three stars mostly because of my lingering fondness for Niven and Pournelle and because I'm just geeky enough to have caught most of the in-jokes, but if you're going to read this, I highly recommend getting the free ebook from the Baen Free Library."
4,"Yes, it is a joke","This is one of these books where the key is not to take it too seriously, just go along for the ride and enjoy it! Yes, the Greens are the bad guys and no that's not normal, but it wouldn't be any fun if nobody ever took the opposite side of an issue. It's a chance to just think ""what if?"" and especially revel in the descriptions of the cons and the strange people and situations they run into on the way - this is a very funny book if you don't take it so seriously. I have been a fan of Larry Niven's for years and I think this is probably the book of his I reread most often."
1,I Can't Believe I Read It,"I can't remember if I finished this one or not. If I did finish it, I can't remember what happens at the end. Some sort of nonsense about science fiction readers outfoxing some environmentalists who control our government. It was an embarrassment to read, in a lot of ways. Not offensive, but incredibly stupid. You feel like you don't want to be the sort of person who reads science fiction, after reading this book.And I read the book because Larry Niven's name was attached to it. For heaven's sake, don't let this be the only Larry Niven book you ever read. I can heartily recommend RINGWORLD or A WORLD OUT OF TIME, but virtually anything he wrote is more enjoyable, even his other collaborations (although a few of those get pretty bad, as well). But this one is really bad."
1,Are the authors insane?,"It's interesting to try to guess what bug got under these guys to make them write such a ridiculously biased diatribe against the environmental movement. I can't believe any responsible publisher would allow a book to be printed that encourages people to burn more fossil fuel in order to save the world! Was this all supposed to be some kind of joke? If so, it's way over my head!There was one funny part. I laughed out loud when the ""good guys"" win because all those nasty Greenpeace people are afraid of computers. What a laugh.This was was nothing but a waste of trees. I suggest burning it and help the authors save the world.Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow zero stars."
3,"A bit tedious, but fun.","The story will keep you intrigued, but it does drag in spots. Two space station residents are shot down as they are ""scooping"" nitrogen from Earth's atmosphere. From there, it's a race to save them -- and then return them to where they came! The good guys are old sci-fi fans, whose ways (most of 'em) are now illegal. Say what? Illegal? Yep -- b/c of the Green Parties that now are in power in most governments. If nothing else, this novel serves as a warning as to what'll happen if lefty radicals ever get their way. (As one reviewer pointed out, global warming is a fact, but the extent to which *man* plays a role in it is far from established. And who says a new Ice Age won't come? I don't think he read this novel very carefully.) Will the ""Angels"" (the fallen astronauts) make it back to space? If most technology is now suppressed, how *can* they? Hooo-boy!"
1,This book sucks!,"I bought this book on the basis of the author's name. I've been reading Larry Niven for 20 years and have come to expect quality hard science fiction with interesting plot lines. This book was a real disappointment. Against my better judgement, I kept reading hoping for the story to develop. It never happened. The plot in this book is a series of barely connected vignettes written solely to stroke the egos of some superweirdos that attend science fiction conventions. The atrocious writing made me doubt that the book was even written by Larry Niven. Money spent on this book might as well have been dropped into a black hole"
1,A lazy Sunday I'll not see again!,"As someone who does live on the shore of the Arctic Ocean, it's getting warmer...not colder. And yeah, I get the fact that this book has a humorous angle and was intended to get a reader thinking...but really! A tedious haul at best, and a promising premise completely wasted by lazy writing. I am a fan of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle both, but I will be looking at their books out of a jaundiced eye for quite some time after this. If you truly want to read this, I implore you to check it at the library and save your hard earned pennies. Can a guy petition an author for his money back?"
1,Not by Niven and Pournelle,"Badly written and unbelievable, this is the worst book to have these two guys' names on it since Footfall. This time Science Fiction FANS save the world. Clearly this was submitted for publication by a fan who attends conventions and Niven and Pournelle decided to capitalize on the fawning adulation of convention kids by helping to get it published. That'd be okay if it was a good story or good writing or a good idea but it's not any of those things. If you like books that suggest that it's important to go to SF conventions and that such people are special because they do, then this book is for you. If you want good fiction in your Science Fiction...stay away."
1,Blech,"This is the first book in a long time that I haven't been able to tolerantly finish. The beginning had promise and then it turned into something akin to masturbatory fan fiction. Maybe this is an homage to the fans who go to the cons, but it wasn't worth my time at the end of the day. This should have been a mimeographed stack of sheets held together with brads and distributed at a con's merch room as a useful kindling alternative. It shouldn't have been published by a reputable publishing house. Avoid this one."
1,My Recamendation,"I think this video was really, really great. This great video would be even more fun to write about and review if only I could spell and other things and kraft a complete scentence. I would recamend a little brush up on my English before you purchase this histearacal video collection which is a must for the collection of any SNL fanatic."
5,PUSHER me off my seat its.....,"PUSHER me off my seat its,its dam good so good it just pulls your eyes out,every picture,seen, just make you think like your there and you can feel the pain,it rocks your brain just seeing the act"
1,Tricked Again #2,"Once again, Amazon tricked me into purchasing a subtitled movie. I hate subtitled movies. Not a single clue in the movie description indicated it was subtitled. Even the trailer is in english. I give this movie zero stars! I give Amazon zero stars for not letting me know before I wasted my money on this movie."
1,It's a hybrid!,"I guess I expected a little more from ConAgra...I mean after all ConAgra makes Rosarita and Chef Boyardee. I don't think that Orville himself would be very happy about a corn hybrid...popcorn should be corn. Go ahead and eat this if you like the flavor, but keep in mind...IT'S A CORN HYBRID! Yeah, the ""popcorn"" does have a fluffy and tender taste, I will agree, but can we really call this popcorn."
2,"A Little Too ""Corny""","This popcorn is a little too ""corny"". It would be better if they took some of the corn taste out."
4,Good... but second album is better,"Don't get me wrong - This is a good album. But, I liked their second album better. It is very much on the 80 ish side - if you like that kind of stuff, you'll love this album."
2,Great single -- mediocre album,"""Get the Message"" is one of the all time great new wave hit singles. Too bad the rest of the album fails to follow suit. Like many supergroups, Electronic gets bogged down with mediocre songwriting and a failure of inspiration."
4,Carried by the strength of a few songs,"I'm a big enough fan of New Order to recognize the influence...very obvious as this is a collaboration between the gods of English synthpop, one of which is none other than Bernard Sumner. 'Getting Away With It' can be described as tasteful when one compares it to the bulk of early '90s dance-pop (do ""Smash"" or ""C&C Music Factory"" ring any bells?). 'Get the Message' has the advantage of having a great video, and despite the fact that the lyrics have the crappiness factor of many New Order songs, the music is first-rate. The rest of the album has its bright points ('Idiot Country', etc.), but they don't match up to the power of the two singles. Still, given the time period, this could be remembered as one of the sharpest pop releases of the early '90s."
5,Combination of many talents all in one........,"This is Electronics first album. I bought it ten years ago and love it like its a day old. New Order's Bernard Sumner,the Smith's Johnny Marr, Pet Shop Boys's Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe formed togather and made a MASTERPIECE OF ART. This albums is nothing less than perfect. Every song is a smash. ""Idiot Country"" and ""Tighten Up"" shows Johnny Marr's talent in full affect. ""Reality"" really touched me the very first time I heard it and has Bernald's voice at its peak. ""The Patience of the Saint"" and ""Getting Away With It"" shows the magnificent coordination of the voice of Neil and Bernald as they perform togather. This album shows the progress of synth-pop and new-wave sound to a new level. There is a mixture of songs that have more electronica and others with more acoustics and guitars.There is a varity for us all in this great album.Also check out other albums by Electronic..""Raise the Pressure"" and ""Twisted Tenderness"""
5,Always Amazing,"This album will prove easily why Electronic are the best New Order side project. Monaco follows in a close second spot - but then again, that's for another review.I have had this album for ages now, but I never have gotten tired of listening to it... the songs sound like they could have been recorded yesterday - that's how fresh and relevant they are.Some of my favourite tracks are ""Idiot Country"", ""Reality"" (I love the beats!), ""The Patience Of A Saint"", ""Getting Away With It"", ""Gangster"", ""Get The Message"" (fantastic lyrics), ""Try All You Want"" and ""Feel Every Beat"" (makes me wish I could play the piano). Okay - I realize I have named eight out of the eleven songs here - but honestly, that's just how much this album blows my mind.If you love great synthpop/britpop or are a fan of New Order (especially New Order a la Republic), then get this album. You won't regret it, I promise."
3,"Uneven, somewhat leaden story of some nasty fighting","Author isn't a gripping storyteller. He pails in comparison to Alistair Horne (VERDUN), Max Hastings (THE KOREAN WAR) or Cornelius Ryan (THE LONGEST DAY). He slips in uninformative quotes like a college History major with a desk full of notes he refuses to pare down (ie. Nimitz to Spruance:""Spru, you are lucky."") for a term paper. Uses too much military jargon and too many abreviations for your non-expert. Details the landing quite well; the reader gets a good feel of the terror and carnage. In comparison, the marines drive inland from the beaches should have been told in greater detail. Author paints a good picture of several of the marines, especially the legendary William ""Hawk"" Hawkins who died in the fighting. Mr. Graham does a decent job with his material; the heroes of Tarawa deserve a greater writer to tell their courageous story."
1,AWFUL,"AWFUL! Campbell Hausefield is a piece of junk. If you want a compressor that is not designed to break in little more than a year go with an Ingersal Rand. I bought a brand new C.H. and 2 months in the set screw for the pulley fell out and rattled around then got lost. The pulley is not close to being true. It is lop-sided and wobbles badly. 8 months after the purchase the compressor slows down to almost nothing after 60 psi. They will not sell me a replacement start or run capacitor only a $200 motor. Found capacitors for it somewhere else but still have problem. Also changed the check vavle and nothing is better. Customer support is awful. can not even tighten the screws at factory, can't make a true pulley, can not say one good thing about it. If you are going to use it 2 or 3 times a year it might last for 3-5 years. maybe. absolute junk IMO!"
2,Not good,"To tell you the truth, more stuff sticks to the bottom of our swiffer thanactually going in the filter. I tried to pick up little seeds with the swiffer, and they just stuck to the bottom. Very rarely do you get to see the stuff pop into the filterwich would have been entertaining. True, it's good for just those messes where they're just small pebbles all clustered together or something but it's not good for yourevery day messes."
4,Great book to a well rounded UNDERSTANDING of Pharm,Great book to a well rounded UNDERSTANDING of PharmIf your the type of learner that likes to know WHY? then this ones for you.
5,Very happy,I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and she is in love with it. I was amazed at how bright it glows with just a short exposure to light. We hold it up to her light just before she goes to bed and it glows for quite some time. We are very happy with it!
1,"I haven't read the book, but the author should investigate.","The OKC BOMBING was the result of extreme hatred created by a series of events. The murder of Randy Weaver's wife and son, WACO, and most important, the destruction of Iraqi by American smart bombs. Nichols and Mcveigh acquired the materials taking almost six months. John Doe 2 an Iraqi, built the bomb in an old white truck (later transferred to a Ryder) with the help of an Islamic Jihad terrorists cell from the Middle East and concealed by local jihad in OKC. Killing children was the plan for John Doe 2. His hatred was uncontrolable. I was a witness to the events surrounding the bombing. There were Americans that hated the Federal Government that wanted to destroy the Murrah Building. The Iraqi's actually did the job with a truck driven by Tim Mcveigh."
3,Yikes!,"Oh my goodness! I bought this book for a little 7 year old girl. She loves ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Corpse Bride"" - and she loves scary stories and such - so I thought this would be perfect. I gave one to my 11 year old too. Well - that was last Christmas - and just last night (it's now June) my 11 year old decided to read the book. This book is NOT appropriate for a 7 year old or even and 11 year old. There are blatant references to sex. How emabarressing! I have to apologize to the little girl's Mom. They probably read the book six months ago and thought I was a sick-o. So - just a warning - in case you think this is a great gift for a kid - it's not."
5,In this CD you learn what is guitar's feeling look like,"I never heard a guitar solo that looks like a human being trying to tell me what it feels like, and how does it feel when its in Love. This CD has a romantic, sensitive, and lovely guitar that sings with the band. It takes you far away in your thoughts and let you dream of what ever comes in mind."
5,Kicks ass on the Gypsy Kings!,Nocy's CD is just as great as his live performance. Can't wait for the next one! His energy is inspiring!
5,Amazing energy!,"If you have a chance, catch Nocy at the Bellagio in Las Vegas - he is such an amazing performer and the entire audience is awestruck! You can't even imagine the energy. His music is wonderful and the CD is one you can listen to over and over!"
1,shallow,"This is a disappointing CD. The music is rather shallow and outdated, with empty virtuosity. It could have been OK 15 years ago. These days there are plenty of guitarists that can playfaster than Nocy. Do not waste your money. Better to buyStrunz and Farah, Ottmar Liebert, Paco de Lucia, etc."
3,..,I'm not saying it's bad but it didn't reach my expectations. Thought they were a bit bigger and kept the chocolate warm for more time.
4,Another Great Chicago Album,"How can a long-careered band keep on creating great music without becoming stifle? Twenty 1 in 1991 is such a challenge.Overall they try to erase out Peter Cetera influence during 80s and get back to their rocking 70s. Ron Nevison who directed 19 did the great job on reconstructing what they are great at. TELL IT TO MY HEART and ONE FROM THE HEART has quite classic feel. New vocalist Jason Chef brings freshness as shown in GOD SAVE THE QUEEN. It is quite similarly styled with LA MOVIES from legendary rock project Radioactive in 1991 just uncovered recently. Jeson Scheff was part of such grand project together with David Foster, Jeff Porcaro and Fergie Fredericksen.It is lamentable, though that since then Chicago have released mostly greatest Hits packages with the exception of Night And Day.Recommended for 80s pop rock fans."
4,One of Chicago's best,In my opinion this is one of Chicago's best albums and a must have for anyone who loves their music.
1,Who Are These People,"There is a CD called Tribute to Cher; the singer resembles Cher, but you know it's not Cher. This album more rightfully should be called Tribute to Chicago. Who are these people? This CD should be called Naperville. It is NOT Chicago!"
3,Wanting to break out of the box.,"After 4 albums of pop, when listening to this album you can tell that the band wants to break out of the mold, but can't. Three ballads on the album ruin the CD for me. I agree that Explain it To My Heart would have been a good tune if someone else had done it. Chasin' the Wind was a poor effort that does not quite get there. You Come to My Senses is awful both lyrically and musically. When I first heard this song, I wasn't sure if I wanted to laugh or cry.Now when I listen to this CD, I skip over these three songs and the rest of this work isn't that bad. Especially God Save the Queen, which is vintage Chicago. Bill Champlin does a good job at Kath-like vocals and the horns really kick it here. I also like Who Do You Love, no matter what others say about it."
2,CHICAGO NEEDS A NEW APPROACH,"After scoring big hits like WILL YOU STILL LOVE ME and WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD I BE with Jason Scheff,I DONT WANT TO LIVE WITHOUT YOUR LOVE and LOOK AWAY by Bill Champlin,the hits stopped coming on 21.CHASIN THE WIND and EXPLAIN IT TO MY HEART are typical,outstanding songs CHICAGO was known for before this album.Jason Scheff falls flat on the dried up ballads MAN TO WOMAN and WHAT DOES IT TAKE.Champlin's WHO DO YOU LOVE is downright silly.Robert Lamm doesnt fare any better on ONLY TIME CAN HEAL THE WOUNDED.As a lifelong CHICAGO fan,21 was a major letdown.If it wasnt for the horn section,I would give CHICAGO 21 1 star."
3,Its not that bad - but it could be better,"This CD opens up with a great track - Explain it to my heart then meanders along until What does it take - a super power ballad that sounds like Chicago with P. Cetera on board. Other than that, Holding On is about the other memorable track here. The others are ok and dont deserve the absolute caining that the critics are giving it. It is listenable but not a vital addition to your collection."
2,"Lots of synthesized power ballads, not much Chicago","This album is largely a collection of highly produced, heavily synthesized power ballads, which had become Chicago's ""sound"" in the 80's. The difference between 21 and other albums from this era is that the core character of Chicago is, to my ears, almost non-existent here. This album could have come from any number of bands/singers/producers. Another reviewer said that 21 does not hide the horns behind synthesizers - well, we must be listening to different albums. The horns are mostly buried in the mix, or are doubled by synthesizers. Based on the many positive reviews, this sound is just fine for many listeners. But if you're expecting to put on this CD and recognize it as a Chicago album, you may be disappointed. If you're looking for recent recordings (i.e. Bill Champlin/Jason Scheff era) that really sound like Chicago, check out Night and Day or Chicago XXV (Christmas)."
4,Should do the trick,"Before buying the Club my old Honda Prelude was stolen and thankfully only gone for a week and a half before being recovered with no visible damage. If you are looking for a theft deterrent that is reasonably priced, the Club is probably what you are looking for."
2,How secure is the lock?,"I am using my second Club, now. I tossed my first one because the rubbery red plastic had aged and was nearly all peeled away. When decluttering my house for sale, I came across the keys to the old Club and thought I would try them on the new one. They fit like my glove goes on over my hand! I wonder how many different sets of keys there are, if any..?"
3,as advertised,but I have learned that thieves can easily cut through steering wheel; I think the brake pedal lock makes more sense.
4,Back to Basics,"This really is a good book, first in `Master Math' series. I was looking for a book to brush up my basic math after 22 years. I found this book very useful. Just keep one thing in mind; this is neither a text book nor a replacement for it. If all you want is to brush up or learn the basics or just a reference, this is the book for you. For some hands on experience or work outs, buy some other book, but after going through this (that will be very useful) Written in a very simple and clear language and it is not just a collection of formulas and definitions. I recommend."
3,Perhaps some edits required?,"looking at the Table of contents, it appears to have a great coverage, and crip layout for easy reference. It is good to review some of these basic concepts that I had learned many years ago, and good to go back on memory lane to school days...I just got hold of an excerpt of this book's chapter 1 - numbers and operators - glancing over. I am not sure if it was intended or if i am missing something, however, page 10 has a typo. it shows:30 + 470 + 6---------10 + 10= 110i hope such typos were eliminated prior to publishing. or am I missing something from the context there?"
3,Really pretty good.,"Really, fairly good and comprehensive as a reference. It is difficult to use if you are trying to relearn a subject, but still 'do-able' If you are looking for a text that will simplify what you need to learn and put it in one place this is for you, but do not expect excellent explanations from the text. Overall, about the same as all the other 'simple' math and science books."
1,Turbulence should have been grounded,"Like the original ""Turbulence,"" this one was a low budget version of the first. Unlike the first one, this flick has half the passengers aboard a stricken 747 as terrorist and the other as ""fear of flying"" passengers to overcome the fear of flying. There's a madman, the plane is in trouble, and a passenger must save the plane on return to Seattle. The low budget effect shows on the airplane's cockpit and the plane on the runway shows the passengers evacuating from a Boeing 737, and similar scenes from the original ""Turbulence."" This flick is grounded."
2,One good scene does not a movie make...,"I don't have much to say about this turkey except to watch for one incredible sequence with the terrorist contacting the control tower. The Tower gives the terrorist the usual talk about no negotiations. The terrorist decides he has to show that he means business. But how? His solution? Start tossing people out of the plane. An effective plan right? But that is not enough for this terrorist. He also wants to send a message to the control tower, to express his outrage at their non-cooperation.So, the terrorist opens the hatch and holds his selected victim inches away from doom. Then, as the plane flies over the airport, he carefully and judiciously calculates wind speed, vector problems, and trajectory so that when he drops the poor sap, the body will rip into the Control Tower like a missile. What a math wizard, he does this all on the fly without aid of a calculator."
1,Turbulence 2: The worst movie ever,"When I saw this movie I was thinking what kind of person would even decide to make this movie. They would've saved a lot of money if they just decided to not make this movie at all. First of all, the special effects were just horrible and the scenes were just like Turbulence. If I were you i would stay away from that movie."
1,Save your money....wait for the 'Network Television Premiere',"Don't bother making a DVD or VHS purchase of this so-called sequel, the pain will only hurt more! Tom Berenger, Craig Sheffer, and Jennifer Beals make a futile attempt to save this movie, but there efforts couldn't revive it. All of the 747 flying sequences are 'stolen' from the orginal 'Turbulence'and to add insult to fatal injury, the movie questions all aviation intellectuals by showing our heroes walking away from a 737 at the end of the movie. Please... Please... Please... Stay away from the bootlegs, video rentals, and purchases of this flick, wait for TBS, TNT, or the USA network to broadcast it instead!"
3,NO WAY TO CURE A PHOBIA,"I'm sure by the end of this movie the fear of flying class still had even more fear of flying. In TURBULENCE 2 FEAR OF FLYING, a familiar scenario unfolds; we know that someone on the plane is going to have to fly it and bring it in safely. This time it falls on the shoulders of Craig Sheffer, who usually plays a bad guy, but this time he's the hero. Add pretty Jennifer Beals as a claustrophobic, too, and Jeremy Nordling as a despicable bad guy with a phony British accent and you have all the requisites for a hold your breath action movie.Given the genre has been beat to death, there are some suspenseful moments and some over the top plot twists, but it's tidy enough to keep a viewer interested. Tom Berenger pops in as the flight attendant, and didn't have to worry about any Oscar nominations for this one!"
2,why?,the first one was all right it held my intist but why did the make a sequel? it is worse then the first one and really should not have been made I suggest this for only lovvers of the first
3,Hmmmm....an okay movie,"I'm a basically an aviation junkie, but I do not really enjoy this movie. When you watch this movie,I found out that some of the parts are the same as the original Turbulence,and those parts are quite blurry.It is about a Trans Con Boeing 747 hijacked,with a chemical toxin onboard.It flies through a storm with the ILS navigational system down.The part I liked most is when the bad guy opens a passenger door and throws a passenger out of the plane while it the plane descends to Sea Tac airport for landing.That's all!"
1,Please don't buy this book,"This book was really disappointing. Over the last 15 years, our family has owned an Irish Setter, Lab, and Standard Poodle. We bought several books to start researching other breeds prior to beginning a search for a new dog. In the preface of this book, it says that the authors of the book have surveyed breeders and owners of the breeds and they trust that the contributors have been candid and realistic. Well they weren't. Do you think the breeders and owners might have been a little partial to their respective breeds??? Much of the information was sugar coated. ""Paws to Consider"" by Kilcommons and Wilson is a much more objective book. It is based on the authors 45 years of combined experience as dog trainers."
4,Furminator kit,My sheltie and long-haired mix breed dog like being combed with the Furminator. The only trick to using the product is to comb lightly. If a deeper stroke is used it will scratch the skin. Both dogs stayed looking groomed for several days during high shedding season. I did not get bushels of fur out like the promotional materials illustrate.
4,Great product,"Great product, but when you brush her hair there is no where to put it. My dog hates when I brush her fur but I don't want it all over me. 4 stars.Sincerly,Lori King"
4,Better than reviews suggest; background knowlege useful,"While the writing is from time to time over the top, the book is very enjoyable. What I appreciate most about the book is its treatment of the actual philosophy behind the development of the algorithm. This apparently is what many previous reviewers dislike. They might be used to books like Men of Mathematics or The Lady Tasting Tea - books that merely provide a brief description of the development of the topic accompanied by some life facts of the developers. Hence, this book is more of a philosophy book than a history book. And for those of us who would rather read a philosophy book than a history book, this book is a breath of fresh air. Reading of the book is helped, however, by a background in both logic and mathematics. Still, the book gets four stars from me as Berlinski would have done well to simplify his writing style."
1,Please don't ask me to tell you what the book was about.,"The book was a gift from my wife because she knows I enjoy keeping up with general scientific developments. I kept reading all the way through because I figured I owed her that after she thoughtfully selected this as a result of a New York Times review. Page after page, I kept saying to myself, what is he trying to tell me? When I finished the book, I was left with this same question that I had from page one on - what is he trying to tell me. Don't bother!"
2,"Beware Uninitiated Reader, Better used as a firestarter.","Upon reading the Preface and Introduction I can't believe my eyes. I have seen english comp 101 papers with more clarity than Berlinski.I am interested in all types of science and lately Genetic Algorithms have peaked my interest; but after my brief journey with Berlinski's prose I'm feeling carsick from the yo-yo inebriated turn of phrase.I suppose this book is redeeming in the fact that it attemts to explain the vast complexity and neccessity of the algorithm, but for one who enjoys syntax and sentence elegance this book leaves a bitter taste for the next scientific read.If you don't know about algorithms already, I suggest you look desperately for another book before you become frustrated at Berlinski's. If already know about algorithms, this may be a brilliant read for you."
1,NOT FOR THE NON-TECHNICAL PERSON,"David Berlinski wrote this book for the mahematicians and computer scientists. He reminds me of the university professor that enjoys hearing themself speak, with no concern for their audience. Berlinski is his own audience. I was asked by a friend that owns an Internet media consulting firm to explain a 3 paragraph passage: 2+ hours later he understood (I think!). Stay away from this one if you're a beginner in te field! FYI, I have over 17 years experience has a systems designer and consultant, with a background in math and degrees in Computer & Info Science and Finance. I speak from experience, knowing that it is not easy to communicate technical info to non-technical people. Good luck!"
1,A Disappointed Reader,Save your money! Stories that you've mostly heard before. Poorly organized and without clear direction. Not up to the promise of the title. Not a book you'll want to keep. Berlinski fancies himself a 'writer'--mostly annoying.
1,"Good only for massive ""skip"" reading","Most boring, confusing and appalling book with all those dramatic and romantic story sections. May be if it was an audio book, I would have given some half star extra. Please make your next book precise and crispier if you want to write about serious stuff. If not stick to romantic novels or scifi's."
3,"Good, if you know something about the subject","I really liked this book but I must admit that is not a book for everyone. Fiction is intermixed with history, and sometimes is confusing. But if you are mathematic inclined and have some training, the reading will prove to be very pleasant.Hofstader's book Godel, Escher & Back has a better introduction to formal systems, but Berlinski book has some good historical points about the subject.I think most people disliked this book because they thought it was an pure account of the history of algorithms. But it is not. It is as erudite account, sometimes confuse, about the creation of mathematical field of logic and its influence in other subjects."
2,Over-written,"I admire an author's clever use of words as much as anyone, but there is undoubtedly a point where the clever use of words becomes ""mannerism:"" the author calls attention to HIMSELF instead of his subject matter.This book fails miserably here. Berlinski seems much more concerned about drawing attention to himself as ""the brilliant writer"" than about explaining his subject matter with clarity.After all, where did the algorithm come from? A major source may have been cook-books, getting a major boost from Charles Babbage, the symbolic logic of Frege, and finally Turing and the actual realization of the computer.Not recommended."
2,Affected prose and poor explaination,"David Berlinkski has done for algorithms what he had previously done for the caluculus; that is, he has taken a bare minimum of technical explaination and buried it in thick, affected, barely readable prose. And as with his calculus book, he is wading into waters where far more skilled writers have gone before.Like the calculus book, this will appeal to readers who don't really want to be troubled by detail, and who like the idea of reading about science without actually having to deal with the difficult notions. It may also appeal to those who don't mind the confusing narrative and who will appreciate the scattershot style and pointless asides.I have to admit I couldn't finish this book. After numerous attempts I just put it aside. Life's too short to waste on some things."
1,very hard to read,"I bought this book, and after reading a couple chapters, I realised I wasted my money on this. Like others have pointed out, the author were too literate on a technical subject. The story kept wandering around, making it hard to follow by me. I have to re-read the text couple times just to make sure I know what he is talking about. I'm very disappointed."
3,Not quite as good as A Tour of the Calculus,"Purple prose aside, this book is not as illuminating as his Calculus book. But then again the subject itself is not as well developed as the Calculus, and the author's mastery of this area is not as sure. The fact is modern logic has never recovered from Russell's paradox and Godel's theorem is more often quoted then understood, or for that matter explained.The author is also a bit chauvinistic in attributing the idea of algorithm to European root when the word algorithm itself came from the name of an Arabic mathematician who taught the world algebra, a fact never mentioned in the book. Also the assertion that calculus and algorithm are the only two great ideas in modern science is wildly exaggerated. Darwin's evolution theory may yet prove to be the greatest one of all.All in all not as bad a book as many of the other reviews seem to imply. Definitely not a book for the impatient however..."
2,The Color Purple (as in prose),"The story of the algorithm is a good one, and Berlinski can write intelligibly about mathematics, which is rare. Unfortunately, the work-like the Tour of the Calculus before it-is marred by the author's stylistic excesses. Berlinski is a notorious over writer. He never met an adjective he didn't like. His historic fantasies simply don't advance the story. To wit: ""The duke of Brunswick, his issue destined for the British throne but his attention fatally diverted by his screaming bladder, waggles his pink palms, rises rapidly from his sea, and without a word scuttles down the long library corridor of the massive wooden double doors, where, after pulling at the red tasseled bell rope, he waits in an agony of impatience for a footman to appear.""There are similar passages on most every page. Don't editors edit any more? Harold Ross would have cut this book to shreds. ..."
2,"Excellent ideas, buried under bad prose","Berlinski gathered the right set of ideas for this subject, and he explains them in thorough detail. In particular, I found the level of detail for Godel's, Church's, and Turing's work to be very informative, e.g. this was the first time I saw Godel's encoding scheme explained well enough for me to see just how it works.However, the prose in this book was so bad that I just couldn't finish it. While it was good that he stayed away from a dry textbook style, the style he ended up with was better suited for a romance novel than a technical history. In addition to the prose style itself, the book is littered with fictional asides that are meant to illustrate subtle points but end up being a distraction. It seems that the author was trying to create both a good technical history and a work of art, but in the end he failed at both."
2,Like DNA - information interspersed with meaningless junk,"Writing as a layperson (and therefore with the risk of missing the subtleties of the book) it seems to me that the book not so much about the algorithm per se as about mathematical logic, which made the algorithm a such general and powerful tool in the present day.The book contains a brief, but useful overview of the development of mathematical logic. Unfortunately it also contains a lot of irrelevant junk which add nothing to your understanding of the subject matter, such as recreations (or more likely) inventions of banal events in the lives of key figures and episodes from the author's romantic life and an ambiguous and mildly disturbing description of an encounter with two Swedish teenagers in a park."
5,Very Creative,"These are neat little books. I bought several of the books in this series for my daughter at Christmas time and they were very neat. They are transparent and when we colored them, you can hang them up in the window and they look like stained glass windows. We used paint markers on them and they turned out great!"
3,Is pretty good,I had the Sony s2 armband radio. I could not pick up any stations either at home or in the gym. I can pick up all thestations that my car can now with this Bad boy! It feels a little on the cheap side but for the price it is great. The ear buds are very cheap. I purchased another pair and the sound is great.Overall the sound is nice to walk or run with. The radio and its buttons feel cheap. I love the radio receiving all channels. I have had no problems with it. Well worth the 15 dollars.
3,Decent radio,This little radio is portable. The biggest complaint I have about it is how fuzzy the radio reception is. It works well on fm stations but is not very good at picking up am stations. Good for listening to tv audio at the gym though. I give it three stars.
1,No good!!,When I first turned it on it sounded a little fuzzy so I decided to really try it out. I went for a walk and it couldn't keep a clear station unless you were standing completely still; and even then another station might interfere. The whole time I was suppose to be enjoying my walk I was fumbling with the stations- trying to find one that stayed clear for more than a minute!
1,AM is terrible,"Just bought one at Target which is in the same parking lot as my gym. Turned on my favorite local sports talk station. AM710 Los Angeles, and proceeded in for my workout. I got about15 ft inside and the station disappeared..completely. It's a strong signal too. The fm stations for the TVs worked good enough, but my main purpose is to get 710. I returned it to Target after workout. Bummed because it got pretty decent ratings . Probably is ok outside, but that's not what my needs are."
1,OK....if you only have one ear,"I bought this radio to use around the house, out in the yard, etc. Right out of the box I discovered that the headphone jack is faulty. I only get sound out of one side. I tried 3 different sets of phones - same problem. I can back out the headphone plug a bit to get it to play out of both earbuds, but then the sound bridges to mono. What's the point of listening to FM in mono?The headphone jack flaw renders this radio unusable. I just threw 30 bucks into the wind."
2,AM radio reception was very poor,"I bought this armband radio to listen to KNBR AM while watching the Giants at AT&T Park. Matt Cain pitched a fine game, but this radio was nearly useless. It only received KNBR when I held the radio up and away from my body, and then not very clearly. KNBR's antenna is scarcely 15 miles from AT&T Park, and their local broadcast radius is about 100 miles, so it's fair to say that the Jensen radio failed to perform its most basic function. Luckily I had my backup radio, an 1980s vintage Sony Walkman. It's bulky, but it picked up KNBR very clearly, no matter where I held the radio. So if you want a radio for listening to sports (or cranky talk) on the AM band, skip the Jensen. I'll post another review if I find a good compact radio for AM."
2,Lasts about a year,"I've had 3 of these things. The first two developed the same problem after a year or so: the volume dial started becoming erratic -- there would be a lot of static at one setting, but turning the dial a little bit in one or the other direction, it would be fine, turn it a little bit more and there would be static again. Pretty soon it got to the point where it was very difficult to find a setting for the dial where I didn't have the awful static.The third one I bought had really messed up A.M. reception where I'd hear interference from some other stations. It was like their tuner's calibration was way off or something. Since I primarily use it to listen to A.M. talk radio, this made it essentially worthless.Three is enough, I won't be buying any more of these."
2,BAD RECEPTION,I JUST WANTED TO GET ONE STATION DURING THE DAY AND IT WAS AM...NEVER GOT AM STATIONS AT ALL. THE FM ST ATION I WANTED WAS ALSO STATIC FILLED. DISAPPOINTING.
2,just o.k.,"I bought this little radio during the spring. The headphone jack lost the left side before Halloween. I can make due with one side of the headphones but who would have thought that would break, and after only 6 or 7 months? I wouldn't buy this one again."
1,"$10 rental, What is Amazon smoking?","Okay you may get me for $10 for Pre-Theatrical Rental if it was Wolverine or GI Joe, but for a movie that no one has heard of $10 is way too high. Think the right price point would be $5."
1,Surprisingly bad,"Given the cast you would think there was something worthwhile in this script, or the direction, or the overall production. You'd be wrong."
3,Average but overpriced,"The movie is average but overpriced at $9.99. I would think at $9.99, I should get the movie (digital copy) when it comes out on DVD for free. The idea of pre-theatrical rental is cool and I hope to see more.All in All if you have $10 and 2 hours to burn, buy it."
1,Never could watch it,"Can't say much about this since I never got to watch it. My son gave me a copy last Christmas and it would not play. I updated the firmware in my Blu-Ray player, but it still would not work. I had four other people try it and none of them worked. I figured it must be a defective DVD, although I never found on before.I decided I would try it again. Same thing happened again. Now I have two of these that will not play."
2,No Comment,"Seriously, no comment. Coudln't go through after 15 minutes. Read a good book, do your chores, hang out with some friends, but don't waste your time."
2,Bad movie,I ordered this primarily because the trailer looked interesting and I like Ron Perlman. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
2,Fair Movie - and not a star higher.,"Let me start by saying that this is the type of movie I would have normally watched on cable.This is a cookie cutter sci-fi movie. And I see no evidence of this film trying to be more than that. You will not see much originality in either the characters or dialog. There are some parts in the storyline regarding their ships and weapons that I thought were original. However, the movie spends almost no time explaining what they are, how they work and why they are using them instead of something more futuristic.If you like Sci-fi horror action movies, then you may have come to the right place. And since you will probably not feel any emotional loss when some of these thinly developed characters die, so much the better you.I would not recommend this movie to my friends who are interested in sci-fi. But if you really like the genre, then you can't beat the price."
3,A steam punk dirty dozen,A steam punk dirty dozen vs. machinemade mutant zombies.The production values of this film are excelent. It fully realises the grity feel of a decaying future fueled by steam boilers.Makeup is also good. The spear armed mech-zombies realy work.Get out the popcorn and enjoy!
2,Weird one word,This movie has no real plot and goes nowhere it is a hold up and fight it out movie with some zombies it is sooooo weird
1,Toxic,"This was a bad movie that should have never been made. The only people that might enjoy this movie mistake would be the same folks that rave about the Toxic Avenger movies, with its interesting subplot and emotional complexity of the monster."
3,Could it be true?,This book has information that I've been looking for for the past two years!!! But is it true??? I've yet to find out. I believe everything the book says but weather it cleanse you out as it claims it does is my question. I am going to try it and then give this book another review.
1,It's not a book...but a phamphlet and a n sales tool for the Amazon seller,"I thought I was purchasing a book, but it was pamphlet .... 8.5x11 paper stapled to a heavier cover. I was offended at the cost of the shipping given the type of book and also that the Amazon seller is selling all the ingredients, which are not inexpensive. Basically the purchaser pays a substantial price for marketing materials of the company and then receives a discount on the first purchase. I felt scammed."
2,one for the lemmings,"I find it disturbing that so many people would take medical advice from a man who was convicted of practicing medicine without a license, and was nearly convicted of second-degree murder when one of his patients died from his treatment.As for the book itself, it seems that the recipe and instructions are reproduced throughout the Internet so I'm not sure why you would buy the book. Regardless, I would consult a real doctor before attempting a plan that recommends drinking salt water."
1,so much disinformation in this book i don't know where to start,"protein can not come from the air.germs and viruses can and do cause disease.this man has a tenuous grasp on nutrition and biochemistry at best.not a complete waste of money, as now i know that this ""diet"" is not any healthier or safer than say, atkins."
2,You can find most of this info on the net,"I read this book and actually attempted to do the cleanse with one of my coworkers after a friend experienced happy results from it. I have to say that the information in the book was intriguing to say the least, but it's hard to discern fact from fiction. I originally borrowed this book from a coworker, but found the entire book reprinted elsehwere on the web. Save your money. You can get the basic info anywhere and would probably be better suited reading some of the message boards highlighting people's experiences. As for my ""run"" on the fast (big time emphasis on run), I lasted all of one day. After purging what appeared to be my actual stomach lining, I was eating chocolate covered pretzels and chicken quesadillas en masse by nightfall. Don't let this deter you though. My friends that finished it reported more energy and both lost a few pounds in the process."
2,This is NOT the Master Cleanser,"I would advise anyone to really research fasting and the requisite, accompanying enemas before plunging into this particular fast/cleanse. It's brutal. I suggest you read the Raw Food Detox Diet Program book and use it to transition your body down for a fast, rather than jumping into this Master Cleanse. Read the testimonials; these people are SUFFERING simply because they jumped right into this fast instead of transitioning the body for it."
2,Think twice before jumping on the bandwagon,"Though many people swear by the master cleanser, be forewarned that it is not for everyone. I tried the diet because I have terrible allergies and fatigue, and I wanted to see what it feels like to be rid of the toxins in my body. A friend recommended Burroughs' master cleanser. I tried the diet for 3 full days, and the 3rd night, I fainted and had to eat something. I had been feeling dizzy and fatigued and that brought on a severe headache. The lemonade suppressed my hunger somewhat, but I still felt hungry. I am very skeptical of Burroughs' claim that lemon juice, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper provide all the vitamins and minerals needed for a person to live healthily for 10 days. He provides no proof of this in his book, only his word. Though I really wanted to feel the results my friend raved about, I found it is not worth the negative repercussions I experienced."
4,Give it a try!,"I was able to do the master cleanse for a 5 day period. By day 3, I didn't crave any food and probably could've stuck with the diet longer. However, getting to day 3 was a challenge.I tried this diet not to lose weight, but for cleansing purposes. I plan to do it again and see if I can get further along with the cleansing."
4,Help jump start my diet!,"I felt so much better after doing this. The first day was hard, then just fine! I did it for 5 days and lost 10 lbs. I have been eating healthy ever since. It's been 2 weeks. I have had no coke or tea for two weeks. Just been drinking water. I used to drink at least 1 diet drink and tea everyday."
3,"Book is a great read, the Diet is impossible for working adults!","I attempted a 10 day cleanse using this and found that I did not have the means(unable to carry around enough distilled water when on a 4-day trip), time (no time between flights to on most days to mix it up) nor opportunity to mix the ingredients together six times a day. I'm a flight attendant and this is not to be attempted if you're on the go. Attempt only if you are going to be home and near a refrigerator (keeps the fresh lemon juice from spoiling). I'll attempt again when I'm on vacation and staying at home."
4,I lasted 7 days!!!,"Diets never work for me. But this did. I have no willpower. I hate exercise. I eat french fries and cookies almost every other day. On this, I lost a pound a day. Was totally bored but never hungry. Woke up without needing an alarm clock...lots of energy and clarity. If you can get past the 'social' aspects of eating, you'll be good."
4,Take control of your body!!,The method of fasting in this book is simple. The book is short and can be read in one day. Apart from helping to cleanse the body this cleansing method allows you to loose weight. I was able to loose fourteen pounds in thirteen days. After finishing the cleanse I lost all cravings. It was easy to begin life afresh after the thirteen day period. I didn't feel hungry neither did I have an appetite. It was very easy for me to follow a healthy diet after this fast.Benefits of the fast are as follows:Detoxify the bodyLoose excess weightNo cravingsAble to start a new life on fruits and vegetables.
3,Excellent Item,"The book is unusal in the writing format, and you can definately tell it wasn't edited by a corporate publishing company, however the content of the text is much more important and clearly states the purpose of the book.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a natural way to detox your body and heal minor ailments you may be having."
3,The Master Cleaner,"If you are simply looking for instructions on how to properly perform this diet, than purchase the new title, ""Lose Weight, Have More Energy & Be Happier in 10 Days, Second Edition."" The Master Cleaner covers the diet, but also gets a bit more self-important than I cared to read about with regard to philosophy on the food industry, vegetarianism, etc. But, if you want to read about the origins (which again, are heartily referenced in Lose Weight, Have More Energy & Be Happier in 10 Days, Second Edition), then have at it."
3,Short and Lemonade Sweet!,"If your looking for a short how to do a Lemonade Fast book, this is the book for you. If your also interested in all the Physical, Spiritual and Emotional benefits of fasting, you should also buy the book ""The Fasting Path"" by Stephen Harrod Buhner, because this book doesn't really go into any of these things.I did this fast for 18 days myself and found it quite helpful. You not only get your teenage 6-pack back, you finally develop an appreciation for healthy foods and become allot stronger when it comes to the emotional aspects of dealing with food.A great fast to be on if you need to keep physically active. And you can't beat the price. Buy it, but also buy the other book I have recommended above."
4,Master Cleanser,I tried this system for the 10 days and it felt great. I was suprised how much energy I still had while not eating.I will try it again later this year for a longer period of time.My allergies are no longer acting up. Before the cleanse I was taking 2 or 3 pills a day just for alergies.
2,Be Leary,"I jumped into this Master Cleanse diet without thinking of the harmful effects eating the same thing for 10 days straight can have on our bodies. I never experienced the increased energy, and I became very dizzy and weak for several days. I stopped it after 5 days. I don't recommend this book or the diet. A 7-day fruit cleanse is a much healthier way to cleanse your body."
3,Open Mind,"I just purchaced The Master Cleaner and was considering giving it a try. But I wanted to read other opinions first. One thing struck me from the negative feedback. The insistance that craving food or denying the body of food was somehow harmful or bad to the body. I imagine we as humans have a very good system in our bodies for handling periods of lack of food. But, because of the way Americans eat, these systems are not used enough or appreciated. I say its okay to be hungry sometimes. I do not need to loose weight but if I do this I know I may have some periods of hunger that I will overcome. But I am confident my body can handle it. This is the process and I understand that."
5,What if the tea or the salt bath doesn't work?,"I have been on the cleanse now for three days going on four. I feel wonderful and have been working out everyday. I have been using the tea at night and also the salt bath tonight, but neither of these are working. It has been three days now since I last went to the bathroom, anyone have any suggestions? I cannot take these in the morning because I work at a bank very early, and cannot leave my counter whenever I want to so I do not want to run the risk of being that uncomfortable at work. Please contact me if anyone has any ideas? Thanks."
3,Tried it with moderate success,"I bought this book on a whim. It was a cheap book and sounded like a fast way to reduce weight in a healthy way.I've had moderate success with this book, which is essentially the lemonade diet. I bought the ingredients, tried it for several days, and lost about 10 pounds in 6 days. The lemonade mixture was able to satisfy my hunger adequately. I didn't feel fantastic, but I felt fine, with no problems.The book is somewhat ""New-Agey"" and gets into the subject of toxins and disease and natural cleansing. I wasn't really concerned with that, and readers will have varying opinions of Burroughs' hypotheses.This is a good system if you really want to lose weight quickly and are ready to commit. Or just try it for a while and see how long you can go."
2,Didn't care much for it.,I wasn't eliminating enough and was worried about the health effects of that. I couldn't stand to drink the salt water or the laxative tea that was needed to eliminate more. Juice fasts and natural foods diets work better for me.
5,Good housekeeping,"I'm all for cleaning the body. This is great stuff. Cleansing the soul of hurts and stinking thinking and deadly emotions is also a must. See ""A More Excellent Way"" by Henry Wright and Doc Colbert's ""Deadly Emotions""."
1,DANGEROUS!,"I followed The Master Cleanse regimen faithfully and strongly caution anyone who is considering trying it. Besides the cleanse itself being a horrible experience, I experienced adverse effects on my health that never corrected themselves. Like most people, I lost weight during the cleanse. I followed the regimen for slowly starting to introduce foods again, and quickly gained twice the amount of weight that I had lost, which I've been struggling to lose ever since. 3 years later, I'm still having far more trouble regulating my weight than before the cleanse. I suspect that my body went into starvation mode and never quite recovered. In addition, my teeth became extremely sensitive, which is most likely a result of all the acid and sugar from the lemon juice and organic grade B maple syrup. It is now 3 years later and my teeth are still painfully sensitive. My take? Don't do it."
2,not worth the effort...,"First time writing a review. Followed it exactly for 10 days and NEVER felt the increase in energy, better sleep, ""magical elimination"", or any other benefit the cleanse claims. This was my first time doing this and was super proud that I accomplished it...but did not feel any physical benefits from doing it. I am not overweight...lost a total of 9 lbs and within 3 days off the diet (and eating very healthy...doing the ease out fully) I gained 6 of those back. I only write about weight loss because I know that people do it for this reason sometimes. Of course you will lose weight, you are only drinking a fluid. I also had major cravings throughout and really had to work hard to control my urge to eat unhealthy after coming off this. Cleansing sounds like a great idea, for a FEW DAYS, but I would try another one next time. This one is unrealistic for starting a healthy lifestyle and turned out to be a waste of effort!"
4,Simple and Effective,"I became interested in the Master Cleanse after a friend of mine started it a few weeks ago. I purchased this book and the enhanced book by Peter Glickman to read up on the process. I had great results and am writing this note on day 11 as I am breaking the fast. If you are interested in the cleanse, I highly recommend you get this book along with the book by Glickman (Lose Weight, Have More Energy & Be Happier in 10 Days, Second Edition) and read it before you start to do anything. The cleanse is simple and effective if you do it correctly without changing anything. Spending some time on Glickman's website is a great idea too. Happy cleansing!"
4,Great sugar buster,I used it and my sugar craving and itching when I ate carboyhydrates went away. I thought I was doomed to noteating sugary starches but this helped rid my allergies I built up over the years. Of course it can return if I return to bad eating. I was surprised and happy with this simple way to rid some candida symptoms.
1,"My grandfather came up with this, watch out","Stanley Burroughs was no healer, believe me. He ruled his first family with an iron fist, beating them and tormenting anyone who didn't obey him. Ever wonder why there's no info about him? Believe me, his public face has been carefully built. He was a something else entirely behind the mask. Drink the lemonade if you want, but know that this was a cruel and inhumane man. I should know. I'm his granddaughter."
1,The writer of this book was convicted of Felony murder,"People v. BurroughsSupreme Court of California, 1984.35 Cal.3d 824, 201 Cal.Rptr. 319, 678 P.2d 894.Facts: The defendant was a ""faith healer"" type dude who tried to heal a guy who had leukemia. The guy died nastily. The healer dude was charged with felony practicing medicine without a license and felony second degree murder based on the ""inherently dangerous felony"" rule. The trial court instructed the jury that practicing medicine without a license is as a matter of law ""inherently dangerous to human life"". The defendant was convicted on both counts. He appealed."
2,Umm...,"hmmmm. this book was really more like a pamphlet. good info and suggestions, but not very involved. i'm thinking that if you're thinking about doing this program (lemon juice and cayenne pepper cleansing), i pretty much just gave you the recipe right there. you can probably find as much info as you need on the internet. seriously- this is by no stretch of the imagination a 'book'.good luck with the cleansing thing- i only lasted two days before i felt like i was going to eat my desk."
2,Don't do it!,"In my opinion any type of fasting or fad dieting is just mental and physiological torture no one should endure or put themselves through. Period! This comes from years of personal testing experience. But life is about choices and we're free to choose whatever we think may work. With that said, this lemonade diet can run your blood pressure way up, causing that slight pain in your left arm, even if you're a teenager in perfect shape. All that sugar(maple syrup) acid (lemons) and cayenne (red pepper) can't be good inflamatory healing regimen. I'm thinking that true healing practitioners would treat patients with techniques and methods that are more holistic and pain free while going through the healing process.If you're really thinking of cleansing and/or detoxing your system, try adding bran, vegetables and a little fruit to your daily diet, especially bran. Over a period of time, this should spell out as a major part of a winning nutritional diet formula."
2,lemon & sugar diet/detox ?,"A rather small book; only 50 pages. Pure maple sugar is not exactly a low calorie food at 50+ calories per tablespoon. Each glass of water prepared as directed is over 100 calories which means you're consuming from 600 to 1200+ calories per day in the form of sugar. Why not do a real fast and give your pancreas a rest too? I don't think this lemon/maple syrup fast is a healthy thing to do, although I do believe a true water fast is good for you. I would recommend ""Fasting and Eating for Health"" by Fuhrman, MD instead."
4,Master Cleanser,"I purchased this book in order to be fit an slim for the summer time. I was SO gung-ho about starting this diet that I carried this mini book as if it were my diary. However, I lost all motivation after only three days. This book is quite informative but unless you aren't motivated, it just won't work!"
1,Uninformative with respect to the internet,"This book has pretty much been duplicated on many websites on the internet. I found much of the information in the book, right online when I searched the ""Master Cleanser Diet"". I wouldn't waste my money purchasing this book when you can research on line. Many of the chapters in the book have been duplicated right there on the internet. Please do your research before ordering! Save yourself a few bucks, unless you just really want the book for future reference. I tried the cleanser and only lasted three days. I felt really good afterwards but during the three days I was dizzy from not eating and the toxins were being worked out of my body. Please be mentally prepared before attempting the cleanser. Your mind has to be right in order to fight the urge to eat, or you may fail."
1,dangerous diet fad,my grammy went through with this cleanse the full month as described. She was healthy and strong before now she can't gain weight and i'm convinced this degree of fasting from food messed up her metabolism.
3,Interesting!,"I think this book is a pretty interesting read. I am not sure how far I buy into Mr. Burroughs claims, but some of his teachings in this book are beneficial. Therefore, I cant recommend this book in its entirety, but it is an inexpensive read for some one like myself who likes to collect knowledge from others perspective."
4,Just the facts,All you really need if you are going to do the Cleanse. Everything else is just fluff.
4,Loved the book...hated the lemonade..,"When I found this book I was actually in search of a diet. After reading the Master Cleanse, which was a great book, I decided that the diet was going to be secondary to the cleanse of my body.The Master Cleanse is a short book, I read it in one siiting. I really like the idea that it is not an overkill on the cleansing subject...it gives facts and it tells you exactly what to do, what more do you need? So as far as the book goes I thought that it was excellent!I started to prepare for the Lemonade Cleanse, I purchased EVERYTHING (which really wasn't much) for the cleanse. I decided that I would start it on January 1st, the New Year! I HATED the lemonade mixture! It was awful! Then the 2 gallons of salt water really did not help...needless to say I did not last over 1 day. :(I still believe that this cleanse would be beneficial for anyone that can tolerate it...and for those of you who can...I wish you the best of luck!"
4,Excellent,"Very much liked the program. Only did it for 5 days the first time but still felt fantastic. Planning on doing it at least 7 or 10 days my next go-around. Book was clear and concise and even added some add'l notes for diet. Highly recommend this book, and the program, for any adult looking to improve their health."
4,Good Cleanse,This might not be the healthiest way to drop weight but can be one of the fastest. I believe its an excellent cleanse but please consult with your physician before trying it.I would recommend it.
3,"I agree with the premise, but not for me...","I agree with the premise of fasting for detoxifation and cleansing, especially in today's world of constant exposure to environmental pollutants in our air, water and food. But the Master Cleanser program just wasn't for me. I cannot do a diet in which I absolutely abhor the taste of the drink supplement. I don't think I ever want to taste maple syrup again! Bleck! I actually recommend the use of honey, as they do in Ayurvedic medicine, in combination with lime or lemon juice and warm water instead of the maple syrup. Even better and less shocking to the system is juice fasting (vegetable and fruit juices). I highly recommend looking into juice fasting as an alternative to this approach. If the taste of this concoction suits you, then go nuts. But if you're like me and wanted to gag every time you drank the stuff, try juice fasting instead. You'll achieve the same results."
1,A complete joke,"I dont know what I was thinking buying a book like this and thinking that it could be a healthy way to lose weight..... Like most americans I was looking for the easy way out to lose weight, instead I started watching calories and dropped over 55 lbs that way, forget this book and educate yourself on real nutrition, you will be happy you did."
2,Disaster,"I went into this diet with high hopes. I bought all the proper ingredients and gave it a whirl. The second night I got a bad headache which was OK. It was gone the next morning. The second and third day were a completely different story. My lower back and the back of my upper thighs were hurting so badly I could barley walk without wincing in pain. It didn't feel like it was ""healing"" anything but damaging something, probably my kidneys. I was never hungry however and the drink actually tastes pretty good. The sea salt wash was tough to put down though. I gave the book away. Good riddance."
1,I never received my order!!!,I ordered my book over a month ago!!! I have not received it yet..... What's the problem?
1,Yuk,This is not a healthy way of losing weight or detoxing. And drinking a gallon of salt water every morning is the nastiest thing anyone will ever do. It's pure torture. I do not recommend.
2,LIKE TORTURING YOURSELF?,"This is a very difficult diet to stick through for 10 whole days. I've heard of people having success with it, but if you are not into tortue, then steer clear of this diet.You can find the book online for free so if you're not 100% about the diet, read online about it before paying for it."
2,Where's the PROOF!,"The book has lots of errors. He makes tons of statements regarding health, diet, and historical references, yet he states no sources. I feel a little weary of the fast, though I may try it anyway."
4,13 days or bust!!,"This is the 7th time I have done the Master Cleanse. I began in July 2004 and have done it every 3 months since. I have worked my way up to 13 days and will probably stay there.Each time I do one I create a new rule to tweak my overall diet just a bit...ice cream only in the summer, NO MORE CAFFEINE (I am 18 months free!), no bread except in restaurants, etc., etc.I am slowly getting off of processed foods. Every 3 months my body knows it is time to cleanse again. It is humbling, spiritual, I drop 15 pounds or so, I can't find a reason not to do it.I cut my cholesterol down to nothing!! Was able to cut my medication dosage in half!The actual book, I don't know, not my cup of tea, I don't even think I finished it, but doing the Master Cleanse...you have to try!! It is easy after the first few days. I feel better on the cleanse then on food. I am on day 7 of 13 now, of my 7th cleanse.Go for it!!!"
5,Excellent Program!!!!,"This program is AMAZING!! Even though I just wanted to cleanse my body, the 16 lb. weight loss was an added benefit. In order for this program to work effectively, you MUST follow the instructions. Don't skip the laxative tea!You have to prepare your mind for this experience. But once your mind is set, your body will follow. Take Care & God Bless."
5,Tried it and this works,"I have already done this cleansing two times for this year. It's best to read the whole book and understand that this isn't a diet or about losing fat to try to be skinny. He explains alot about the types of food we eat, especially the american diet, and how it can make us sick. When you complete your fasting time, you would have a new found respect for your body and what you put into it."
2,Got Lot Less Than What I Paid For,"Just another fad book with some useful information. They say ""you get what you pay for"" and in my opinion I have proved this saying wrong.I got lot less than what I paid for. Thanks"
1,What a load of Poop - LITERALLY,"I think the whole point of this guy's hypothesis is, if you eat good, and fast to ""detoxify"" then you will never get sick. In fact he blames all sickness on poor diet, and believes if we all followed his advice there would be no sickness in the world. (The author is dead by the way, looks like it worked great for him!)THE GUY IS A CRACK POT!But go ahead, buy this mess, and starve yourself on spicey lemonade if you must. You'll crap your brains out (Author calls it ""ellimination"" so you don't really think of the time you spend on the toilet, or running to the toilet before you soil yourself!)A needless mind trip that reeks havoc with your bodyENJOY!"
1,A great diet! (Note-I'm being sarcastic!),"Having the lemonade may be fine for people wanting to lose weight, but the diet the author recommends afterwards is horrible. To recap: NO meats, NO dairy, NO sugar, NO alcohol, NO processed foods (ie no candy, fast foods, potato chips, etc), and of course, no honey.That leaves fruits, vegetables and grains only. You have to freshly prepare everything you eat. Gee, sounds like a lot of fun. Maybe if I could afford a personal chef I would do it. But on my own it looks like a lot of work. I'd still have to resist all the fast food joints I pass on the road all the time, and if I have dinner at a friend's or relative's I'd have to remind them, ""Oh by the way, I can't eat that, and that, and that...."" Even if it made you live to 1000 it wouldn't be worth it. Even the people who really believe in the diet must stray from it every now and then."
3,WOULD ADD A 1/2 TO THE 3 IF I COULD,"however, this is worth a look but in no way shape or form would i ever call this one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I sometimes wonder when people say things like that if they really see many scary movies like i do. Anyway there were some creepy moments and as far as that HORRIFYING ENDING i think it was somewhat predictable. Maybe i have just seen too many scary movies. But as i stated it is definatley worth the look but dont expect to be horrified."
3,2 second fright,"I wanted to try and find a really scary movie. I read the reviews on here for this movie and decided to buy it. One quick fright toward the end that I admit made me jump out of my seat. Besides that 2 seconds of being scared, the rest of the movie was boring and drawn out. I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 for that 2 seconds I was truly scared. Since most scary movies aren't scary, I figured one good scare deserved a couple extra stars.."
3,Disappointing,"So many people told me this was a scary movie. I didn't know what to expect, but I found it disappointing and frankly laughable. Rent it or check it out at the library. DON'T BUY IT!!!"
2,Are you kidding me?,"Only once have I been tempted to write a review here, and this is that time. After reading the other reviews, I actually spent the excessive amount of money to purchase this DVD thinking it would be worth it since I love nothing more than a good horror movie. How wrong I was. What is everyone thinking here? This was a low budget campy movie with B-C rated acting at best. The only redeeming quality of this movie is the fact that the so-called ""woman in black"" is in fact creepy to look at. Other than that, it was barely worth my time much less my money."
2,Wish I'd Stuck With the Book,"I love the book, read the online reviews, and was in a fever to buy the DVD, figuring it was a safe bet.The movie needlessly changes/omits so much of what was perfect in the book. I want to find out if the play is closer to the book - if so, I'll make a point to see that!"
2,Interesting but....,"I enjoyed ""Woman In Black"" but wasnt as impressed as the other reviewers. I found ""The Others"" a much more impressive and scary Victorian feeling Ghost movie and I love ""The Grudge"".It just didnt disturb me, and thats what I look for in a ghost movie."
5,Woman in Black and The ring,"This movie is one of the scariest things I ever saw.No gore, no special effect, just a good story with a good theme and this makes the movie one of the best horror movies I saw in years (yes I know it's an old movie).Why the ring?The ring is a new movie that brings you to a new level of horror and terror.The cinematography is shocking, acting brilliant; the story is top of the top. The viewer is gripped from the start and being pulled inward with no hope to escape up to the finale second.You want a night of horror? Get the ring, get the woman in black, you wont regret, you wont thank me for the nightmares but you wont regret it.Ziv."
3,Cheaper copies on ioffer....,"I own this movie, and it is fine. It's not great, but it's good. The remake is much better.The reason I'm posting is looking at the outrageous prices people are trying to charge is really annoying. I checked ioffer, and there are reasonably priced copies there. Don't get robbed by the greedy folks trying to rip you off here."
2,THIS WAS NOT SCARY,"This was a slow movie. Maybe if the ""women in black"" was in the movie longer then two minuets it would of been better. The reviews for this movie is all hype. If the movie is as good as everybody says Iam sure people would of heard of it, or it would be more popular then it is. Overall, this movie is just a plain old ghost story, not a scary movie."
1,A huge disappointment,"After hearing so much about it and reading the glowing reviews of it here, I finally broke down and purchased this disc. I was all set to be scared, or creeped out, or something.....anything! I was severely disappointed on all counts. I had heard that it starts off slow (which it does, trust me), but that it works up to a tense climax. I watched and watched and watched, waiting for something to happen. My eyes kept looking back and forth at the running time on the DVD player, thinking ""something has got to happen in the last 45 minutes...ok, in the last 30 minutes...well maybe the last 10"", but it never does. There are plenty of moments when it could've been really creepy, but naturally this being a made for TV film, it cops out. The ""woman"" is in it for a total of about 5 minutes. After watching it I had the same disgusted feeling I had after watching the Blair Witch Project. I knew I should've bought The Changeling instead."
1,"Sorry,,, but it's the worst horror movie i have seen","i saw the movie... and it is not scared at all... if you wanna talk about scared movie for ghost you can watch ""Evil Dead"" for example. Sorry but i fell that i have wasted my time by watching ""The woman in black"""
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!,This is the worst horror movie i have ever seen. Was it supposed to be scary???? The Blair Witch was scarier. I wonder if i saw the same movie that all these others are talking about.
5,Obscure Gem,"... Well, it terrified me! This is a really well put together little film. It's well written, well acted and expertly directed by Herbert Wise (does this mean all ghost movies directed by men named Wise are good?). It also has the most frightening and malicious ghost I've seen on screen, in the person of actress Pauline Moran. If you love ghost movies that are scary because of atmosphere and not overloaded special effects, don't miss this one."
3,Not Quite What I Expected,"After reading all of these reviews i finally broke down and bought this movie. It starts off slow, and i expected that, but then it never really picked up, I was expecting to see something really scary that would make you not want to watch this at night, but all i found was something that made me almost fall asleep. Don't get me wrong there were a few scenes that made me think OK now its gonna get good, and one that genuinely put a chill in but, just didn't deliver to me. I liked the story behind it, you know the evil lady in black showing up all around at different times, but thats all, they could've at least had made so that she had even more impact when she showed up but I don't know, I took a gamble and I lost, but don't let my review stop you from buying this."
3,An Old-Fashioned Spooky Ghost Story,"If you are looking for a blood-and-guts slasher horror movie, go elsewhere. This is an old-fashioned ghost story. The suspense and dread build slowly toward a shocking and intense finale. The image of the Woman in Black standing on the marshes in broad daylight is certainly more frightening than a ridiculous hockey-mask monster chasing a nubile, stupid co-ed."
3,"Not bad, but not great","After reading all the amazon reviews on this movie, I couldn't wait to see it (being a movie buff). While it is good, I don't understand all the ""scariest movie I've ever seen"" reviews. It builds nicely with some spooky sequences, but I never really felt like the film hit it's stride. If you like this genre try The Haunting (original), The Wicker Man, or maybe The Asphyx. Again, not a bad movie, but don't go in expecting as much as some of the reviews indicate. IMHO."
4,The Woman in Black,"Enjoyed the movie, but the packaging of murchandise could have been better. Surprised it wasn't damaged in shipment. I wouldn't classify it as the most haunting."
4,Really great ghost story,"I was skeptical when I got this movie. It's foreign, no actors you know, and it looks like it was filmed for PBS. However, it has a very good plot and the acting it solid. If you are a horror movie buff, you'll like this movie."
3,The Woman in Black,"This movie was entertaining, but I thought it would be scarier. There were several scenes that left me with a chill down my spine, but not as many as I like in a ghost story. The last scene was the creepiest to me and kept me awake for a while the night I watched it! I just kept picturing this woman standing in my bedroom!! It is somewhat like The Changeling, but I think the Changeling had a better story line."
3,In your FACE!,"About 2 months ago I watched The Woman in Black (1989) online. The film perfected a ghostly atmosphere and delivered several great jump-out-of-your-seat moments. I was a little disappointed with the details in the storyline/background of the actual woman in black and found that the ending completely fell flat *SPOILER*(A family of three in a small boat-tree falls on boat-everyone drowns(?)). It was almost laughable. But I must say that overall, the film actually was pretty spooky. I'd also have to say that the -up in his face- scene really did freak me out! Haha I gave it 3 stars because the newer version deserves 4..."
4,"Creepy, but Flawed","This is well worth a viewing. Written by Nigel Kneale of the Quatermass series, it provides tension and horror without computer animation, cheap special effects, or any gore whatsoever. The scene in which the title character appears in a cemetary near the old house is quite spooky although it is in broad daylight. It is a film full of disembodied voices, shadows, and mists which produce a pervasive creepiness that gets into your mind. It is far from perfect, however. I am not sure I fully understood the explanation for the goings-on. Perhaps my attention wandered, but it seemed as if it had been poorly cut. The ending seemed a classic case of ""we have two minutes left, what do we do?"" The logic of the story leads to a bad end, but not this end."
3,A spy's memoir,"True stories about a Frenchman who faced danger in the murky world of spies, detailing both heroes and traitors that he faced."
3,One man's account of his life in Army Intelligence.,"Reading this book is like finding a man's diary and having access to his inner thoughts as he walks through his life as a man and U.S. Army Officer. Filled with refreshing insights into everyday life and historical information about his adventures in the U.S. Army and his role as an intelligence specialist, this book is an enjoyable read for any one who enjoys human interest stories."
5,A very useful resource,"Smoot bills his book as a ""Selected Climbs"" for the rest of us. I'm not quite sure I buy that, but I do think this book deserves a spot on the shelf nestled in between ""Selected Climbs"" and Beckey.Compared to Goldman's ""75 Scrambles"", it is noticably better in some respects: it covers a wider range of climbing (all the way from class 2 to easy class 5); it covers a wider variety of climbing (more snow routes); and it does a better job at providing and describing options beyond just the most popular route."
2,Thin on info,"I was very disappointed with this book overall. It has some good data in it but is lacking in other areas, such as trailhead elevations and other pertinent information. I found that I needed to consult other sources whenever I climbed a mountain that was listed in this book."
4,Enlightening overview,"If you can overlook the large picture of Charles Darwin on page 43, and perhaps an unnecessary attempt to accomodate some of Darwin's theories, you will find this to be a first-rate overview of the Bible, its message, and its proper interpretation and application."
2,Forced to read this...now my revenge!,"I had to read this as a textbook for the Southern Baptist Seminary Extension.You'd think that a Southern Baptist course on Hermeneutics would choose a book that adhered to a 6 days of creation model. You'd be wrong.This book also left a bad replacement theology taste in my mouth. Mr. Stott is thoroughly British...his overuse of the word ""Palestine"" proved that.I recently saw a copy of the Hardback with color photos...I think I'd rather have bought that one.For an alternative, Chuck Missler's ""Learn the Bible in 24 Hours"" is a better choice."
5,I laugh just thinking about Season 5!,"This may be one of the best seasons of comedic television ever. Just when i think I found the funniest episode of Friends Season 5, I watch the next one and keep right on laughing. This Collection of episodes is priceless."
5,A great season,"I loved this season! Chandler is my favorite ""friend"", and he's great in his role as Monica's boyfriend. The writing of this show is fantastic...don't care for the friends' lifestyle, but the show is SO cleverly written that I rank it as one of my all-time favorite shows."
5,Amazing!!!!,Friends is the best show in the world!!!!!!! The 5th season is really amazing and I just can't get enough!
5,How does the relationship between chandler & monica work?,"after all that london sex thing happened, in season five i heard that joey & rachel found out then phoebe then ross, how did they stay after this?did they sit together hugging each other in central perk like girlfriend and boyfriend?or did they still stay like friendz?"
2,Not that great!,"I am one of the biggest fan's of Friends in the whole world , i am right now trying to collect them all , i have so far season 3 and 4, they are very very funny, but season 5 i have to say is probably one of the worst. Now for it to make sence you would probably want to collect them in order, well not really, cause i think all get season 5 in last, so all go right over to 8!!!, lol yes 8!!, i herd that its one of the best. If your a big fan wait till the end to get season 5 cause its the crapiest"
1,not great,i think friends is not great. 5th season is boring. went downhill.got worse from here. I wish it was a better show. but it is not. so any Friends dVd set is better than this. even though none of them are not great. i would give one 2 stars. I think. well dont get this. its not great. ok thats what i say.
2,A comedy? - gotta be joking,"I have seen reviews that the show was hilarious and gave it a try. I watched about 5 episodes and found that the jokes are not funny at all. Only dull and unoriginal lines, which could have been guessed, therefore making them not funny.Ever wonder how come none of these characters ever have their own stand up show? if someone is not funny at all, s/he doesn't want to make a fool of her/himself trying a stand-up.What happened to America sense of humor? The show is not funny. 2-stars for the story, o-star for the humor. 4-stars for DVD menu: average 2-stars."
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny. Love these guys. I will be collecting all box sets. when you are having a bad day. watch friends lol.","Funny, Funny, Funny. Love these guys. I will be collecting all the seasons box sets. Whenever you are having a bad day watch friends lol. Total mood change every time lol."
5,must buy for any friends fan,"This season is a must buy for any Friends fan, two weddings, London, Vegas, triplets born, chandler/monica relationship,, What more could you ask for. Season 5 is one of the greatest seasons of friends.The special features are great. There's a 40+minute feature about how an episode is put together, very interesting to watch.So, if you own seasons 1-4, then there's really no reason not to buy season 5, now is there?Come on, what are you waiting for, go buy it, now."
3,What happened to the outakes?!?,"I love Friends, it's my favorite show. So when I missed the original airing of the Outtakes episode hosted by Conan O'Brien, I was so upset. My only solace was that I knew I could just see it when it finally comes out on DVD. So Region 2 (UK) gets Season 5 a few months ago... and they get the outtakes. Region 1 (the US and Canada) gets Season 5... and there's no frickin outtake episode! I feel robbed. So unfair!"
5,Came at the perfect time!!,"This was a Christmas gift. It was supposed to arrive on Dec. 23...which was the day i was giving the gift away, so i was hoping and praying it would be here by then. and it was here two days earlier! i was so glad. i actually had time to wrap it decent!"
5,Very satisfied!,All of the DVD's were in perfect condition. The box was also in great condition. We really love this show!
3,RIP Friends,"In season 5 the show begins to go downhill. Seasons one through four are outstanding and it really is a shame. All the characters start acting differently, mostly for the worse and can be very annoying. I am definetly a ""Friends fanatic"", and I know how different this season is from others. There's a few good episodes for sure, but overall I think my Friends obsession has ended in this season."
3,Nothing to write home about,"This small book from the late sixties seems a bit dated now, and lacks the kind of emotional power it might have had. It tells the story from the point of view of a 12-year old son in an upscale California family who decide to adopt a black toddler. The community disapproves, and the family must ask themselves difficult questions. With short chapters, the book makes a quick and easy read for teenagers, but it fails to draw many conclusions except for uncertanties. Perhaps this makes it more believable, but it does not make it more readable."
3,Okay,"The product was just ok, it fit my 4 yr old fine, but it was missing the cap, the on,y reason we kept it was because my cousin had a supergirl cap from six flags that we used. Other wise we would have returned the product."
3,missing belt,The costume came on time but very wrinkled and missing its silver belt. The boots fell apart the first time she put it on. It survived Halloween but basically its one time use outfit.
2,Super cute but terrible quality!!!,I received the costume for my daughter and of course she loves it but even before she tried it on I noticed a piece of it was broken and now the belt is also torn!!!
2,Future Memories charges 20% restocking fee!,"We followed the size chart exactly and were disappointed to find the small costume, which arrived quickly, was too small for our 4 year old who fit both the height & weight chart listed by Rubies. Worse, Future Memories charges an undocumented 20% restocking fee so it is barely worth my return postage to get my money back."
5,Great costume and fast delivery!,"This costume was really nice. It was even prettier in person. Great quality, great price. I also received this costume fast in the mail. Great service!!"
3,Tight Across Shoulders,"Ordered the size small for my 5 year old. Had her try it on, it was very tight across the shoulders. And the cape seemed shorter than pictured.We are exchanging for a Medium.Bought the Pink Batgirl costume in a Medium for my 7 year old and fit great."
1,i need to start making my daughter's costumes again,"i've never bought a halloween costume that would be considered a ""quality"" item, so i wasn't exactly surprised to find that the seams and fabric on this would not stand up to even one wash in a washing machine. i need to start making my daughter's costumes again; a little planning will go a long way on saving $20-$30 next year"
5,Great costume,"This costume was a hit. Size small (4-6) fit my 4.5yo girl just fine. My only complaint would be that the boot topper velcro straps came undone a few times, but that was a minor thing. Overall, a great purchase."
5,Pink Supergirl,Taylor just loved this outfit and wore it to school and at home for days. Would not take it off!!
5,Very good costume,My six year old daughter really loved this costume. It was what it said it was in the details. My daughter still plays in the costume on occasion.
5,awesome! and well made!,daughter wore it a lot before halloween......i've thrown it in the wash (low spin cycle) and hang to dry.....very durable........ the shoe part was only worn on halloween.......you cannot find this in stores...........!!!
4,Beautyful,"Mi little girl love it, the only thing we don't like is the boots are too big comparing with the dress size"
5,Girl Power!,My 4 year old loved the costume! The silver is coming off of the belt and it is separating a little from the foam padding; but other than that it is a great purchase. We received it very quickly too; thanks Rubies!
3,cute halloween costume,"This costume is really cute and well made BUT it was not sized right. I bought 2T-3T and it was more like a 3T-4T. I really liked the costume so I kept it for next year but I ended up going to the Disney store to buy another one. I really didn't want to buy 2 costumes, I have no idea what my daughter is gonna want to be this year."
2,tight shirt,I have a larger chest and this shirt is tight. tight all around. I wear this shirt under my scrub top at work. it's okay.
1,Burnt out,"Mine lasted for 14 mos. before burning out. I can still get sound out of it, but if I have a cd playing, I can hear it on all inputs (tv, dvd, tuner, etc.). I can't believe Technics made such a poorly engineered product. I had a Technics receiver before this one that had lasted me for 15+ years through moving many times and college abuse, so I felt comfortable going with Technics again. I should've checked around more. Don't buy it."
3,Would be outstanding minus the heat it creates,"I purchased the 930 based on the recommendation from a magazine. While I agree the sound is excellent, the heat it creates is hot enough to fry an egg on. And yes, after one year of use my 930 did burn out one of the fuses. Thankfully I had purchased 3-year extended warranty on it, so I was able to get it repaired for free.If it weren't for the heat, I would have given the 930 a five-star rating. The sound is that impressive.My recommendation: If you purchase this receiver, make sure you get an extended warranty with it. If you don't, you will probably be disappointed."
1,Too Hot,"I followed ALL instructions, I even installed two fans one below and one above to keep unit cool. I guess that is why Mine lasted almost 18 months. The thermally controlled fan NEVER went on.AVOID THIS P.O.S."
4,Great Accessory,"I used this pick to play for a couple years at a church. It's a great accessory. Takes a little while to get used to holding and using it, but it's fun and adds a little zest to just the regular playing/strumming. If you don't cup your whole hand around it, it won't mute the shaking sound and is fine. I agree with one reviewer it's not the absolute best pick. But, I don't think it's that bad if you're just jamming for fun and want some rhythm."
2,"Good shaker, poor pick","Sounds great as a shaker, but it's too too big, heavy and unwieldy to be useful as a pick. On top of that, the pick itself is too thin for my taste. The the Rhythm Ring instead."
2,Rhythm Pick,"I am not crazy about this item. Great concept, but it doesn't sound that great to me and the pick itself is very soft.The shaker stays in your hand of course, which mutes the sound quite a bit as you strum. Clever idea, butdoesn't do the trick. Sorry to have to say so."
4,He's got the love part right,Hard read if you're just a beginner. I wouldn't recommend this book for a new Christian. You need to be firm in your faith in order to grasp some of the concepts.
4,Hard to understand,"It is hard to understand for readers with an average level of understanding of the English language.However, what I understood from it, is very well-written and with a unique flavor and interesting perspective and depth of analysis."
5,Perfect for any who would understand academic competitions for grades K-12,"Mary K. Tallant-Runnels and Ann C. Candler-Lotven's ACADEMIC COMPETITIONS FOR GIFTED STUDENTS: A RESOURCE BOOK FOR TEACHERS AND PARENTS is a key resource perfect for any who would understand academic competitions for grades K-12. From their impact and potential problems to selecting events to match student strengths, ACADEMIC COMPETITIONS appears in a second, updated edition to make a case for matching academic contests to the needs of special students."
5,Why you will NEVER see an Extraterrestrial,"Read this book!If you wish to debate the X File's fan - read the book. If you just want to ruin their most recent UFO siting you only need to read Ch 9 Are We Alone?The simple mathematics presented will assure you that the Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) was NOT Extraterrestrial!Nearest Star with a slight chance of a planetary system - 6 light years ( 3.3 X10^13 miles).Typical speed of a space ship (Apollo - 25000 mph | 7 mps) 10 miles per second.Time in a sooped up Apollo space ship 100,000+ YEARS!Think we could build a bit faster ship tomorrow - a resonable max speed of a rocket = 41 mps. See the end notes page 223 for ch 9 note 5. So divide 100000 yr by 4 and it is still too long 25,000 yr. by a factor of 1000!"
4,Review on the effects of the character's life & changes.,"This book was a very disturbing but engrossing read. I could not put the book down once I picked it up, Becca of Wiserways is a throwback to the women in today's society. With a period that comes once a month and a mind that hungers for more than what a decent woman in her society is expected to want. A very dangerous thing to be, when women are considered nothing more than breeding stock. Her life and its trials is our only chance to view this strangly familiar but totally alien culture. Ms. Freisner did a wonderful job of setting up the reader, I would have liked a more complete view from other characters about what was going on in their aspects of the story but for the most part the book read well. If you want to think about the story you read, if you want more than mind candy consider reading this. It is fantastic picture into what we as a population can degenerate into when civilization in ripped to shreds."
4,Io,"I found this band by accident but am glad that I did. A very interesting combination of sounds that I haven't tired of yet. Not like some of the other techno stuff that all seems to run together after awhile, very interesting use of tape loops from NASA."
5,Unfinshed Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth,"This book is great. My name is Elvara, at least that's what my fellow Numenor and Middle-earth historians call me. If you're as much of a Tolkien freak as I am (I learned the entire Elvish language in 4 days)you will find this book great and informative. It also leaves you thinking about certain things such as: What really happened to Amroth and Nimrodel? For those of you who just like to read fantasy I reccomend this book. It isn't a book that has a consistent topic or has consistent characters since it is a collections of tales, but that wasn't a problem for me. My favorite tales were ""Narn I hin Hurin"" or ""The Tale of the Children of Hurin"" and ""The Battles of the Fords of Isen"". It even includes details about the Istari or (for those who don't know what the Istari are) the Five Wizards. I hope you find my review helpful.Namarie"
3,time & money,took more time than expected to ship and custom fee was too big. Item itself is as expected. Also all 3 items were separated in 2 different packages (still waiting for the last one).
5,Fantasy???,"The Unfinished tales by J.R.R. Tolkien reinforces the sense that one is not reading a fantasy at all, but a history that goes back a very long way. Here one can read the history of Galadriel and Celeborn, and of the mysterious Istari. True Tolkien fans will love this! After a journey through these pages, both the movies and the written trilogy seem to have sprung from an ancient and nearly forgotten manuscript. Most enjoyable reading."
2,Unfinished Tale of Numenor and Middle Earth,The work is like a scholarly treatise and not a work of fiction like those written by Tolkien the Father. The son is not the writer his father was.
1,Kindle version hard to read,"This review is only for the Kindle version. While reading this version, I was constantly distracted by the inclusion of the chapter headings into the text of the story. For example, ""of tuor and his coming to gondolin 25"" is inserted into the middle of a sentence at location 356 of 9703. I've had this same problem with other LOTR Kindle books by this publisher."
4,Very interesting,"This is one of the most underrated of Tolkien's books. It actually contains lots of interesting tales about Middle-earth, including one or two ""outtakes"" from the Lord of the Rings. A must have for Tolkien's fans!"
4,More from Middle Earth,"Well once again Tolkien's tales are spellbinding and historic. A true triumph in story telling. Unfortunately most of the stories are ""Unfinnished"" but there is narrative that explains the direction of the stories ending. if you want to find out as much as there is in the Middle Earth world, than read this book."
3,"fast shipping, but damaged goods","i was very happy with the turnaround on shipping, considering i elected to have the book shipped with amazon's free supersaver option. unfortunately, the (hardcover) book arrived with the upper right corners of both the front and back covers smooshed, as if someone dropped it from a considerable height. it is not bad enough to warrant all the hassle of trying to obtain a replacement, yet it is disappointing nonetheless.therefore, the three start rating is for the condition in which the book arrived. as for the content--well, it's tolkien. and as much as I loved The Silmarillion (I daresay it is my favorite book of all time), I can't imagine that i will not thoroughly enjoy it as well."
4,Tolkien = love,Wonderful all around. However the book arrived with a torn corner on the dust jacket... wasn't too thrilled about that. Great story though!
4,So much more information!,"I bought this after I realized I didn't have anything with The Quest of Erebor - so although there's a lot of material that covers some of the same events as The Silmarillion, there's a lot of other new material, too!"
5,Gift for Tolkien fan,The person who received this book was very pleased with it. He was missing it from his collection and he said the liked the cover art too.
5,An amazing novel,"I enjoyed reading each of Tolkien's first five books: The Hobbit, the Lord of the Rings, and the Silmarillion. If this is true for you, and you especially need to like the Silmarillion (I have read reviews where people don't like the Silmarillion), then you will enjoy reading Unfinished Tales. And like all of Tolkien's novels, I recommend buying it, because I believe you will want to read it more than once. However, this novel is not like his previous novels, or even like the Silmarillion. This is a collection of short stories and a publication of Tolkien's notes on some items of interest spanning from the Battle of Unnumbered Tears until the destruction of the Ring. Included are stories on Tour, Turin, Numenor, Eorl, Gandalf, and Saruman. I can say that reading Unfinished Tales has enriched the world of Middle Earth and I highly recommend it."
1,Unfinished Tales of Numenor & Middle Earth,It seems this is only a retitled version of Unfinished Tales.Which naturally recieved 5 Stars. If not Please let me know. The sample matches the originally titled book exactly. This review is from the sample.
3,Good But Scattershot,"This album reminded me of all the wonderful things inspired bands can do with something as simple as a 4-track. The songs are extremely hypnotic, and some (like ""Echo, Bravo"" and ""Earth Moon Transit"") are not as ""Slowcore"" as critics would have you believe. My only complaint is that they end too soon. Track #1, for example, fades out just as its screechy weirdness and drum beat start to get interesting. Duster would have done well to cut a few items off this album's 17-song menu in order give their best compositions more room to breathe."
2,Beautiful Crystal but NOT BOXED,"I purchased these flutes as a wedding present and was VERY disappointed to receive them in the mail. While each glass was beautiful (although quite larger and not at all dainty as I was anticipating) and adequately bubble wrapped for shipping, they were not packaged in a Waterford crystal box... or even a small plain cardboard gift box. The description lists that the item is ""Gift boxed with care leaflet."" There was no care leaflet, either. Each glass arrived in a separate amazon.com shipping box (approximate dimensions were 4.5"" x 12"" x 16.5"") and surrounded with a ton of bubble wrap!!!! If you are purchasing the glasses for yourself, this might be ok. If you are purchasing them as a gift, you may want to consider purchasing presentable packaging so it doesn't look like you bought the glasses at an auction or estate sale."
1,Dreadful!,"Ming Ho Siu, the reviewer who gave Maxim Vengerov, a Russian Jewish violinist 3 stars for his interpretation of the Concerto for Violin & Orchestra in D minor, opus 47 by Jean Sibelius was right on point. Vengerov had utterly failed to capture the expanse of Finland's landscape. Leonidas Kavakos' recording, also available on Amazon, is an antidote for your ears to Vengerov's dreadful sounding performance."
5,Nice rain stick,"Nice rain stick. The string on it (on the end on ours, not the middle) adds quite a bit to the appearance. If you want a serious rain stick, get a longer one. But for your money, this is a really nice one."
2,"Good seller, ho-hum product","The first rainstick I received had spilled its contents all over the inside of the mailing box. When I contacted the seller, they sent another one out right away and told me they didn't need the first one back. The second stick arrived and works fine, but it is a very short rainstorm, which I guess could be remedied by buying a larger stick."
3,Not very rainy sounding,"Perfect in every way. Good wood. Well made. But for whatever reasons the beads all go over at once. No trickle down, water sound. 10 year old says Im doing it wrong. Otherwise, love it."
3,Just ok but not necessarily the fault of the seller,"When I had seen rain sticks in the past, they were straight, round and had a smooth clear finish on them. Very fine craftmanship but very expensive, so I expected all rainsticks to be made this way. I was excited to buy this for our grandchildren to play with and hear the beautiful sounds. While probably not the seller's fault, perhaps they could list in their description that these are made in a more natural style such as how they would be used by the native americans. They are not perfectly straight and round and the outside is sanded, but slightly rough dry feel of the natural cactus (I think that is what they are made from.) I don't want to cause the seller to have a bad review as for the price that was paid, it was ok but just not what I was expecting."
4,Better than Oreos!,"These are wonderful cookies! However, the reason I couldn't give a full 5 stars was because so many of the boxes in the case had a lot of crumbled cookies. The boxes were not damaged in any way, so I am guessing they could have been packaged that way. Not cool! Otherwise, they are much better tasting than oreos in my opinion. I'll never go back to those!"
2,Charger & Batteriers for Canon CBK4-300,"Not happy with this product. The batteries do not hold a charge well at all and it does not take pictureswell because of this. Will not order from this Company again.Not sure where they purchased this product from, even though it says Canon on it.EJW"
3,Rechargeable batteries for Canon digital camera,"Battery life seems to be mediocre, not sure exactly how long it takes to charge to full, light on charger constantly blinks for 2 hours and it heats up really fast..."
5,Great Batteries,I have noticed an over all performance upgrade in my Canon A630 since purchasing these batteries. They last a long time and the Camera operates faster all together. The lag time has reduced in between photos trememndously.
4,Camera Batteries,"I purchased these batteries because Canon recommends them for their digital cameras. They do last A LOT longer than regular batteries, even lithium... They charge quicker than other rechargables, I would recommend getting the charger with the batteries and another set, if you are anything like me, you hate being in the middle of taking great shots and the batteries die!!! I keep the extras charged and ready in my bag."
5,"Excellent, but slow to charge","I've owned my Canon camera and this charger and battery combo for several years now. I don't use the camera very frequently, but when I do, I use it a lot (on vacation, at a family event) and wind up taking around one-hundred pictures or so with many of them using the flash.These batteries are always ready to go, even if they have been sitting in the camera for months. They never run down on me during use. The charger is only a little larger than the batteries themselves and plugs directly into the wall socket (no ""wall wart"" or power cord needed). The prongs for the power plug fold into the charger so it packs down to a very small package, which means you'll probably bring it with you on vacation and you'll have it when you need it.The only drawback I would say is that the charger is of the ""charge them overnight"" variety. It's not fast, but it does the job. As long as you aren't looking for a quick charger, I'd recommend this one."
4,Good purchase,"Good purchase, help up well until someone unknowingly put regular batteries into it and fried it. Not its fault, that was the persons fault. I went back and bought the same one as a replacement."
3,"Slow to charge, fast to dissipate","While it does work, these batteries or unit are slow to get fully charged and quickly lose that charge even (and especially) when not being used. If I set the camera aside for a month and pick it up again the batteries are dead even without any use. I think I'll be investigating and investing in a couple sets of LCD AA's for my Canon next time."
4,Will pay for themselves!,"The Cannon rechargable batteries and kit are well worth it. Very easy to use and will pay for themselves in battery life alone compared to buying AA OTC batteries. Still keep some OTC Batteries in-case the rechargable ones die. They hold a nice quick charge, great accessory!"
5,"The best thing for hair moisture,dry hair,curly hair.","I am a Hairdresser,and have bought every product available. This is the very best for dry hair! No matter what I purchace to make my dry hair look good,I always go bach to Potion 9!"
5,The ONLY product I will use on my hair. Have used it for over 10 years!,The ONLY product I will use on my hair. Have used it for over 10 years now. Wouldn't use anything else!
3,Love this product,"I'm a long-time Potion 9 fan. Great price! However, the bottle started leaking a few months after I bought it, so I put some of it in a tupperware container, and the rest I sealed off. I think the container started leaking for some weird reason. Oh well, love this stuff. Awesome for your hair."
5,Magic in a dime-sized dollop,"I have fine hair, so most conditioners weigh it down. My hair, nevertheless, goes frizzy on humid days. Not with this product! A dime-sized dollop worked through while my hair is wet keeps it smooth but not greasy, and surprisingly it seems to add volume as well.If left to air-dry, Potion No. 9 holds my hair in place like a mousse (I have short hair). When blow-dried, this prevents split ends and adds a nice shine.I love this stuff!"
2,"pump bottle defective, cannot get product out","I have been using Potion 9 for several years. I like it that it can protect hair (allegedly) and functions like hair gel which holds curves just enough. My review is about their new package, the pump bottle. I must have gotten a defective one as I was not able to pump anything out. I called the customer service number on the bottle to ask for a replacement. After being transferred 5 times, talking to 5 live people one after another, I finally got the number of Sabastian Professional Satisfaction Guarantee department (1-877-NO-RISK-9). Problem is the guarantee is for 60-days after purchase, and mine already elapsed. Eventually I had to take the whole pump mechanism apart and fish the product out through a hole in order to use it.For those who buy this at local stores, make sure the bottle works before walking out of the store."
5,Potion no 9,"Love it!! Great for hair, wet or dry, styled or natural,makes it look healthy and manageable, decreases frizz on fine hair without weight. Had trouble finding it at retail outlets."
3,Not the one I bought,"The one that I received it wasn't the one that I bought, I was expecting the American product, but this was Made in Mexico."
2,not durable at all,"We've had this puzzle for about a month. My 3 year old son loves it and plays with it daily. Almost immediately the board holding the puzzle began to warp. That is okay, since he can use it without the board. BUT, in the last week, two of the pieces have broken. The ends where the puzzle pieces connect seem to be very brittle. We've glued it and he's still able to use it, but it won't be long before it ends up in the trash. We have several other (smaller) wooden puzzles by M&D, so I was really surprised to see the poor quality in this one."
4,Great,"Very nice, beautiful. my daughter loves this puzzle. Wish the pieces were thicker, as they are more cardboard like, than wood. Probably 1/4"" thick (actually less). would be great if they had a little more feel to them. All in all, a nice puzzle"
4,dino puzzle for 2 year old,My 2 year old granddaughter is crazy for dinos. This puzzle is bright and colorful. The pieces are holding up to repeated puzzle solving by an enthusiastic toddler. The only problem is that the pieces are tightly fit and were hard to seperate the first few times.
5,Melissa & Doug Puzzle,"The prehistoric Sunset Dinosaurs puzzle by Melissa & Doug is great. The colors are vibrant, the puzzle is just tricky enough for a 3/4 year old to have to work it a little bit and it's extremely durable. We love it!"
4,Colorful and enjoyable puzzle,"Melissa & Doug Prehistoric Sunset Dinosaurs Jigsaw Puzzle is fun for my six-year-old grandson. He has liked doing puzzles since he is four years old, and this one is just right for him. My only complaint is that the picture of the completed puzzle is under the board and not visible while making the puzzle."
1,not durable,"Out of the box, most of the pieces were coming apart. The pieces are made out of plywood (or some similar engineered wood product) and it seems that not enough glue was used in manufacturing them. Don't be fooled by Melisa and Doug's cute, home-made marketing angle; it's just more made in China crap."
2,Pieces are breaking the first day,"I purchased this puzzle for my 4 year old daughter and while she may love it, I don't.Apparently the picture is glued to the wooden pieces and within an hour it started peeling/flaking away. I super glued it back, but as we've played with it more pieces kept peeling apart. I love Melissa and Doug products but I'm diappointed in the quality of this puzzle. Maybe it's a fluke with mine, but if I had to do it again I wouldn't have purchased it. It's impossible to tell a 4 year old to gently break apart the very study pieces so that they don't rip the picture off."
4,Awesome!,"I only by chance came across this band while doing a search on another band and had a listen to the samples, I was so impressed with what I heard that I just HAD to buy this album, it is fantastic! If you like country music with good vocals and a rockabilly beat, then this album is for you!"
5,"Hard to find, but grab it anyway!","Everything you ever wanted to know, or needed to know but didn't even know it, is probably in this book.Think of this book as an abridged encyclopedia. Judy Jones and William Wilson have compiled more information than you could imagine in one easy-to-read, even fun-to-read, volume. Clearly organized, well written, respectful, and intelligent, this book will make you an instant experton topics you hadn't even thought of.Read from start to end, or just pick a page at random, you'll be entertained, informed, and educated. Art, History, Politics, Religion, Sciences, Music, Philosophy, Architecture, Lierature, and Psychology. Even a crash couse on the do's and don'ts of writing English. You name it, it's in here somewhere.My only complaint, it's time for an update. Or a Volume 2. This one's a must have"
2,Okay book but you may want to skip psychology,"Most of what I read was pretty interesting, especially the sections on art and music. Very detailed and insightful. However, having an interest in psychology, I was looking forward to that chapter. Turns out to be nearly entirely based on Freudian Psychology and ignores most of the work in the field in the 70+ years since his death. The chapter also lumps homosexuals in with ""fetishists, devotees of S&M"" and ""perverts of all stripes"" and describes how the lot will probably never be happy considering the compounding of neuroses. I just thought the entire chapter was extremely dated considering it was supposedly updated in 2006 and contains references to modern day personalities (Jim Carrey, Daniel Day-Lewis, etc)."
2,There Has Got To Be A Better General Knowledge Book Than This,"Not an absolutely horrible book. Informative, but in a biased way. There has got to be a better book out there that provides a general knowledge information. At least it had a huge discount when I bought it."
2,Disappointed,"Excellent musicianship and to die for voice, but below standard sound & video quality. I have to put on Alison Krauss + Union Station or Eagles' Hell Freezes Over to remind me, that the DVD medium CAN be good. Any producer making a life recording should know this by now. Save your money, by one of Capercaillie's CD's instead."
5,Titlecapercaillie collection 1990/1996,This is a awesome dvd for anyone truly interested in gaelic music. A must see. Highly recommended I'm sure you'll enjoy!
5,Knew 'em when...,I lived in the Western Highlands during the 80s when Karen and the band were pretty much a bunch of local kids(a very talented bunch having said that)playing the scene there. It's been a pleasure to watch them and their success-- you'll enjoy this!
4,Nice panel raising bit,"I purchased this bit for panel raising and really like it.I needed to match a raised panel from a very old desk to make a series of kitchen cabinets, and Grizzly was the only manufacturer that I could find that had a profile that looked like this.It is a very simple profile and gives a wide reveal.The bit worked very well. It has a very large diameter, so you will want a powerful table mounted router to spin this thing! I used a 3.25 horsepower Hitachi with variable speed and ran it on the next to lowest speed setting.The finish was very good. I did minimal sanding on the resultant panel and they look great.Take very thin cuts. I was working with quarter-sawn white oak and just kept raising the bit in small increments as I made successive passes.Very nice, I would recommend this bit.Pat Robinson""The Man"" Installation"
5,Very Moving,"Probably some of Randy Newman's best work, goes along with the movie, which creates an emotion, which is exactly what I feel a movie and it's score is supposed to do."
1,A case of denial,"Women's religious orders are in an obvious state of decadence. Many will die. There is no secret what are the traits of the few orders which are flourishing and are attracting the young: religious habit, corporate apostolate, common prayer, fidelity to the magisterium. Blinded by ideology, however, Sister Sandy insists that the orders are actually in great shape. This is simply denying the quick death of women's active orders and the need for real reform."
1,Not much of a treasure,"This is a very strange book. Religious orders in the United States, especially active orders of women, are dead. They are dead demographically and spiritually. The Enneagram has overwhlemed the divine office, the rosary, and the examination of conscience. Yet, oblivious to this crisis, the author simply whoops it up about how great things are."
2,Bad production,"The sound is horrible for a 1984 album, the composition are immature.The vocal is hard to listen to, bad musical transition.The band did much better few years later but with this debut album, they were still looking for a musical identity.I give two stars for some few good moments of ""The last Human gataway""It seems that the band like the same part than me of ""The last human gateway"" because these parts have been played live on ""Forever Live"" and they didn't play the rest."
1,"Unlistenable vocals, immature compositions","IQ got much better, but why they weren't a stillborn band after this release is beyond me. Peter Nichols' vocals on this album are little more than moaning, groaning and mewling. The compositions are little better: jerky transitions played by musicians who aren't sure of themselves yet. There's not a selection on this CD that redeems it."
1,Unsatisfied Customer.,I bought the item from you guys and batteries are junk. They die out every 5 min. Total waste of money and time. Felt it was falsely advertised and I got stuck.
4,Classics are that,This is for people who want to watch smart comedies not slap stick or low level. A great combination of movies with some of the best actors/actresses of their time.
4,dvd,This came in record time and in awesome shape- wish all the orders were this quick! great experience for me.
1,Incorrectly sold,"This item can not be played on a uk system on 3 of the 4 films on the DVD.It is only suitable for the US market for those 3 films,which makes the DVD a poor choice for the UK market.....this should have been made clear of its limited use."
4,"Delightful movies, HORRIBLE LABELING","Okay, these delightful romantic comedies from yesteryear are a bargain. That said, I've got to be one of those jerks that nitpick, because there is a real problem.The only labels on these two two-sided DVDs are the microscopic writing around the spindle hole. I've got to use a powerful light and a magnifier to see which movie is which."
1,"Scratched dvds, same location in two sets","Cannot comment on movies, the dvds were scratched upon arrival. Amazon was their usual great self and sent out replacements, which were scratched in exactly the same place...sigh. Quality control is obviously not a high point with TCM, so buyers beware."
1,Only two DVDs,"The package only contained 2 of the 4 DVDs advertised on the package - Adam's Rib and Philadelphia Story. Luckily, Philadelphia Story and Adam's Rib were my favorites of the 4, but still..."
5,TCM Greatest Classic films collction: Romatic Commedies (Adam's Rib...) enjoyed by family member.,This was a gift for a family member. I know it will be enjoyed since he is a Katherine Hepburn fan.
4,Four funny flicks,"This collection consists of four classic films starring Katherine Hepburn. And that's pretty much it. No fancy packaging. No neat little liner notes. Just two discs, with one film on each side, and a very few ""extra"" features. For very little money. The first set included a damaged DVD that would not play the whole films, but I returned it for a replacement and had no problems with that one. I'd hesitate to give it as a gift, knowing that many customers have had quality issues with the TCM series, unless the recipient is someone I knew well enough to be sure they'd feel comfortable telling me if theirs was damaged. On the plus side, I got four flicks for less than $1 each, and they are ones we won't mind watching many, many times.This is a good buy for those who just want good films without paying much. Not such a good buy for those fans to whom the presentation is as important as the contents."
4,"GREATEST C;ASSOC FILMS COLLECTION: ROMANTIC COMEDIES: Just good, old fashioned Romantic Comedy","This is great old-fashioned romantic comedy, by the masters! It doesn't grow stale, but only becomes more enjoyable with familiarity. I greet the Incomparable Kate, and her leading men, Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Jimmy Stewart, as old friends."
1,Bringing Up Baby would not play,"The movies were good except for Bringing Up Baby, which would not play. I only got to see about 10 or 15 minutes of the film. Who do I contact to get either a refund or a dvd disc that will play the movie."
5,I'd have paid $50 for this!!!,"Our children have watched this DVD a few times and quote lines from it, scripture, and in a short time have applied the lessons learned - priceless. If they begin having an issue related to the teaching in the DVD, one of them will remind the other about what the story said and they will discuss what to do - mind you, these are two little boys under the age of seven!!!For details regarding the story, read Merchent's review (it says it all). All I can say is I wish they were making as many of these as they have VeggieTales"
4,The pros and cons,"First the cons: ... The fence is fastened to the table duringshipping and the paint was obviously wet when it was shipped as therewas a fair amount of dried paint on the table in the shape of the fence outline. The table also had a slight burr around the spindle opening that had to be removed before wood would slide easily across it. It takes 4 srews/nuts to hold the wooden fence to the metal part - they sent one. No hex key wrenches were included although you need several to adjust the fence. The manual content and orginizaion was so-so. Also, a miter guage would have been nice.The Pros: once the above problems were corrected and the belt adjusted properly, the machine worked like a charm. The 5 hp motor muscles through cuts with ease and the dust collection works quite well. There is virtually no vibration and it runs more quiter than I'd expected. If you don't mind doing some of the finish work on the tool, it's a nice piece of equipment."
5,Industrial strength,I purchased this not on-line. It is a very good unit and has performed to every expectation I had. Just remember to get a power feed for most work and the fence is tricky to setup the first time.However I like it much better than the other units because the quality of cut requires no finish sanding and this machine can cut all day long.
4,Right Plug at the right time,I went to Scotland and got this right before going. It worked like a champ and also the countries printed on the different adapters was a big help.
2,disappointed,"I was very disappointed to find out that this converter can't be used for TV, computer, etc, which is not stated on Amazon's website. I intended to use this converter for my kid's nitendo DS when we traveled to China this summer but it couldn't charge the battery."
4,great for backpacking,"this was such a great buy. i was alittle skepical buying any converter after reading the reviews, but this one was the best choice. i backpacked through the uk, france, germany, and holand. every place that i traveled to, i used this converter. had no issues, problems, or burnouts. i mainly used just the adaptors for my camera and computer which were 240 voltage or 240v. you can read this on anything with a plug to determine if you will need the converter. if it is less than 240v then you will need one. for example, the air dryer was a different voltage, without this converter it would have broken. also,just dont leave anything plugged into the converter for a long time. that is how you avoid anything breaking/ burning out. hope this helps :D"
4,Great choice for multiple destinations,I've had this kit for years and taken it on short trips throughout Europe and Great Britain. It worked great and never shorted or fried any of my electronics. Once in awhile I would end up in a old hotel or home and would find an outlet of a somewhat different shape where it wouldn't work. I love that each plug is well labeled so you know which to pack.
5,The Best Foreign Power Converter for The Money,"We've used this converter in Europe and it worked just fine. Friends of mine bought the cheaper $6.00+ units and watched them smoke and start to burn as soon as they plugged them in. I'm a Travel Agent and this is the unit I recommend to all my clients, it's tried and true for most purposes; but not recommended for power gobbling appliances such as irons or heaters. But not to worry, high capacity units are availble on Amazon.com"
4,Great little set for a Great price!,"If you're looking to do a lot of world traveling, get this set! Set includes plug adapters for just about every popular destination available."
1,Didn't work,"I just returned from a trip to Ireland where I attempted to use this converter. It literally fried my curling iron. Luckily somebody smelled it before it started on fire. And the converter itself started melting when I tried to use it for my laptop. Lucky for me, the people I was with had a different converter that I could use, since this one apparently didn't convert anything."
1,Fried Our Chi Iron !!!,"This converter did not work. We used it in the UK with my daughter's expensive Chi hair straightener. There was instantly a buzzing noise and the ceramic plates started to melt giving off a burning plastic smell. The iron was ruined! If you value your appliance, take my advice and leave it at home rather than risking it with this horrible product."
3,"Good, but make sure you research","I bought this because it came with all adapters and a converter, expecting to be able to plug all of my things in over seas. But when I got it, I read the package which tells me not to plaug in any electronic equipment, such as cameras or battery chargers. Bummer."
1,Behind the Times in Europe,"Purchased this for a recent trip to Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The power converter has a large plastic case which does not allow it to be plugged into most of the new recessed central European outlets. I had to borrow another converter once I reached my destination and use only those items with a 220 voltage switch. Cheaper, Euro only plugs would have saved me money and worked better."
5,Travel plug adaptor,I am so glad I bought this. The European plug worked in great in Italy on my IPOD.
4,everything you need,This converter kit has all of the adaptors I need in one compact case. I used it in Australia last month and it was hassle free. It plugged into the outlet securely and then stayed there as long as I needed it to. I would recommend this adaptor.
1,Bad product,"It blowed up on it's first use. It claims up to 1600 Watt, but cannot even use with a 100 watt speaker.Don't buy it!!!"
4,MUST HAVE CD,I DON'T KNOW THE OTHER GROUP MEMBERS BUT I KNOW SMOKE HES BEEN RAPPING FOR SOME TIME IN EAST L.A I KNOW THIS BECAUSE HE KNEW MY BROTHER ROGELIO MUÑOZ JR. AND HES ALWAYS BEEN CRAZY WITH HIS RHYMES AND WITH THE GROUP THEY ARE CRAZY. I THINK THIS IS A MUST HAVE IF U LIKE CHICANO RAP.
1,"Horribly shallow, spoiled by empty rhetoric and generalizations","Johnson neuters any actual insight he might have effectively instilled in his readers by writing in generalizations. In writing the universal he uses the particular as examples in unfair and inaccurate representations of truth. Moreover, his actual writing is shoddy and employs logic in inappropriate and backwards ways."
3,good and bad points,"Privelege power and differance has many good aspects to it It really provides of how things like racism, sexism and homophia play themselves out in our society and how people can over come these problems. However, the book has a tone of white guilt to it which makes it hard to believe. The book deals with the author's opinions on why capaitism is detructive and so forth.The book is worth reading if you want to objective."
1,Not Happy,"This book was assigned to me in my Criminal Justice class. It is very easily readable but FULL of mis-represented statistics and mis-quoted quotes.This book has a major tone of shame directed at white americans. Mr. Johnson even attacks the American capitolist system, insenuating that it is a racist system.This book is biased and very opinionated but the authors writing style mimics that of facts and statistics.NOT recommended, especially for easily impressionable. I am very disapointed that this book is being used ""unbiased, true, and factual"" education tool."
3,Secretive changes.,"""Sneakers: A Novel"" is a modern, technological thriller novelization of the movie ""Sneakers."" For those who have seen the 1992 movie: this story is not at all the movie you've come to love. It's different. With added and altered scenes, you may become a little perturbed, like myself. Of course, background information was given for each character, which didn't really happen in depth within the movie, but the information seemed too far-fetched. The character of Carl had the biggest change, and I don't think it was for the best. Nonetheless, if you're reading this without seeing the movie first, then it is an interesting story about technology, and how it can be used for the worst. I ""sorta"" recommend."
5,Essential to post 9/11survival!,"Holly Near usually sings to my soul but this is more than that. Her ""I Ain't Afraid"" is my lifeline to sanity now.Blesings to her and all of us."
5,Best Moisturizer in the Planet!,So light weight but hydrating! Great product! I won't use any other moisturizer now! A bit pricey but worth every penny! Jar lasts a long time too!
2,"Great bra set, but questionable sevice.","My friend did like her bra set. However, when I received the package, the bra set was all tangled up. It seemed to be hastily & roughly thrown into the mailing package. There was no wrapping or plastic around the bra set, & there was no care to its look or condition. I had to untangle the item myself & tried to make it presentable.The bra set was very nice & sexy, so I hope that in the future their products are delevered to customers with more care."
3,"Tight, precise performance but lacking in passion","The requiem is performed using a relatively small choir --- more a chamber choir. If you are looking for a huge, grand performance this is NOT the one to get. The recorded sound is excellent.As far as the visuals are concerned, Abbado is rather cool and emotionless.The DVD is absolutely lacking in any bonuses what so ever. Multiple view feature is most useful in orchestral pieces but is not used. The production does not take advantage of the possibility of the medium. Classical DVD music productions by comparison to Movie DVD's are meagre and this production is no exception.It is far cheaper (especially in this case of the rather expensive ARTHAUS production) to buy the CD performance on Deutsche Grammophon,since the visuals are not that interesting anyway."
4,Rest Periods Fully Explained,"I have read the customer reviews, some of which complain that there is no mention of rest periods between sets. In fact, this is covered by the author--15 seconds between sets except in the case of dips its 15 to 30 seconds between dips. On whole this is an excellent book and an excellent work-out. I subtracted a star only because there are certain instances when the author does not fully explain certain techniques. Add the star back if there is a posting board that the author responds to, as one reader reported."
5,Great book! Worth its weight in Gold.,"I started Lt. Smiths workout three weeks ago and am feeling great. I liked the variety of exercises that it offers. You can feel the burn the first day. It's great. All you need is a pull up bar, a pool and dedication. Just a good old fashioned workout, except one hundred times more intense! Great book if you want to be a Seal. I got a few years until I can enlist, but I'm confident that I will be in awesome shape and ready for anything! Good Luck! Hooyah!!"
5,Body built by Body,"Who needs weights? Stew Smith shows that a great body can be built without even touching a weight. However, his workouts are tough. I am still working in the beginner 4 week routine because I can't even qualify for the PFT. It is very easy for me to do the workouts because I live 5 minutes from the Virginia Tech campus, so I have ready access to an assisted pull up/dip machine and a pool. If you don't have a pool don't worry you can substitute a tough cadio workout for it. This is my second week through the 4 week program and my arms look bigger but I think they are just more cut. I definitely recommend this book to anyone training for a marathon or just wanting to get into extreme shape."
5,THE BUD/S Workout,"The thing to keep in mind about this book is that it isn't, and wasn't made for beginners. It's a very advanced workout. It has to be, it's for preparation for SEAL training. But don't be turned off. The workouts are as challengling as they are accomplisible. They will get you into the shape you need for BUD/S, or if you don't want to be a SEAL, then by far the best shape of your life. The book includes stretches, tips, points of contacts (the dive motivators) and a lot of other recomendations for BUD/S.Highly suggested if you are planning on going to BUD/S."
5,Great Fitness Program,This is one of the best fitness programs ever. Regardless of if you are trying to become a Navy SEAL or not this is a great physical fitness program. The exercises are explained well and and theprogram is easy to follow. Great tips for just overall fitness are included throughout the book. I love it and use stuff from it all the time. I will be buying products from Stew Smith in the future.
4,Not for the faint-hearted!,"This is definitely high-intensity -- if you're willing to start a 12-week workout that has you doing 660 abdominal exercises on the first day of the second week, this is the book for you.A couple of caveats:1. You should be in shape already. The reviewer who said the ""beginner's"" workout is too hard for most people was absolutely right.2. You should already be a strong swimmer to be able to accomplish the amount of swimming prescribed.3. You'd better have plenty of time available to work out. Workouts like:Run 3 miles. Swim 100m freestyle sprint, then do 25 pushups, 25 ab exercises (repeat swimming/calisthenics 10 times!). Run 3 more miles.are not exactly the fodder of the ""Easy Lunchtime Workout"" articles in most fitness magazines!4. There are a couple of omissions, like how long you should rest between sets. And you'll be doing a *lot* of sets. Fortunately the publisher has a website with a discussion area where Lt. Smith ans! wers questions like this regularly."
5,A Must Read For Those Who Are Serious About Fitness.,"Lt. Smith's book is informative, motivating, and easy to follow. I'm a 23 yr old male planning on pursuing a career in the SEAL Teams. I knew I needed to get moving with my physical fitness regimen but I lacked direction and motivation. The Complete Guide to Navy SEAL Fitness was exactly what I was looking for. It provides insight into what is arguably the most intense and demanding military training anywhere in the world. Pictures showing calisthenic exercises, as well as stretching, make it great for beginners and seasoned athletes. The ""12 weeks to BUD/S Workout"" is well organized and leaves nothing to the imagination. Its detailed diagrams and charts on running, swimming, and calisthenics will challenge you and certainly improve your overall physical fitness....there's no doubt about it. Bottom line, it's a great book, and if you complete the workouts inside, you'll be in the best shape of your life."
5,Excelent training guide,"I'm in the US ARMY, and we know that the SEALS are the PHYSICAL FITNESS GOD'S of SPECIAL OPERATIONS. I used this book to help me increase my endurance, and boy did it ever do that. My push-ups are stronger,as well as my sit-ups, and my 2-mile went from a 12:27 to a 11:50 in just a matter of 6 weeks.If you ever decide to join the SpecOps community or you feel as though you would like to do something totally different than the usual weightlifting, or anyother activity that you do, then try this workout out. The only thing that it can do is benefit you, and make you stronger, as well as increase your self-confidence. Good Luck."
5,The Good Book,I have been on the 12 Weeks To Buds for 3 weeks now and my scores are already in the 100's. I am on deployment right now so I have to get creative with the swimming exercises but the program still works. Thanks Stew Smith!
5,Oh my!,"To say this is an intense workout is a gross understatement. This book is packed with information to help you through the workouts. Like others have already said, this program is not for the fait at heart. It requires a tremendous amount of intestinal fortitude to get through, but once you do you will reap your rewards.Thanks again Stew!"
1,Good Book but not,I bougth this book about copule of months ago. The book is execellent. It show you really challanging exercises. This book out dated. The way Stewart writes about doing the exercises is not completely accurate. Some exercises are done little differently. I know that because my friend is going to Navy Seal. Anyway this is good for people who really like to challange themselves.
1,Worthless,"In the first place, Navy SEALs are the most overrated bunch of amateurs in the Special Operations Community. They are more interested in getting good press coverage and what brand hand to hand program charlatan is going to say he trained the most fearsome warriors on the planet the; deadly U.S. Navy SEALs. This book is just as much hype as are the SEALs it is limited in scope and barely scratches the surface on any detailed fitness intellect. One would be better off getting off their couch and start doing the exercises you were taugh in gym class in high school and then going to a fitness club for some professional instruction before buying this garbage."
5,WOW!,"I'm still working up to the 12 week workout, and am in the best shape of my life. I played college football, and was never in this kind of shape!!LT Smith has revealed a way to get in the kind of shape that is hard to imagine looking back.I've lost 20 lbs, can do over 200 pushups (in a workout) in about 5 weeks of applying just the beginning phases of his workout.I can't wait for the rest."
4,Only for the strong,"Wow! what a workout! I have been in the fitness industry for years and this one is bad to the bone. No shortage of challenge. Forget trying to get ""big"" muscles; you will scare your friends just by completing the program and be in better shape than 99.9% of all gym rats!"
3,Good but not great,"A good book IF you have the time to do it all. As a former Marine, I stay in good shape but in my job I don't have time for gyms. I began using this book and did see some changes and improvements. But as I progressed, the routines took longer to complete. Perhaps editing the book into sections for those who have limited time might help. But if you have the time, this book will get you in great shape."
5,Fun reinterpretation of the original,Didn't know what to make of a new remake of the show initially. After watching the show it is very nostalgic yet is able to make fun of itself at the same time. It's great to see Casey Kasem as Colton Rogers and Matthew Lillard as Shaggy again. This is a real treat for the fans of Scooby Doo.
5,Finally a solid reboot!,"When I heard there was a new scooby doo series, as a fan, I was thrilled (and of course ready for the inevitable terrible-ness) but it wasn't there. This reboot, is high quality, with inventive art style and new, cool, and modern music. It still manages to keep a lot of the silly humor, but it does so tongue-in-cheek to boot, so soome of your favorite scooby doo cliches are still there, but the writers let you know that they're quite aware.Not to mention all of these episodes have a dire and involving plot going on in the background that may actually end the gang for good. Clearly, the writing and villains have improved, and the show now has a subtle hint of scary throughout."
3,Scooby Doo,"I love the power of buying things from the Kindle Fire for my five-year old son to enjoy. It makes life a lot easier, though he is frightened of these for some reason."
2,"OK book, but it's a UK publication w/ little detailed info","I bought this book hoping for a detailed, year by year comparison of each and every year Spider. What it is, in effect, is a vague story of the Spiders. It has its good points but lacks very much the precise detail Alfa owners need. Not enough pictures in color. The title is misleading, should be called ""A Vague History of the Spider"". Not a good purchase..."
2,Not Happy,I ordered this beam for my daughter for Christmas. I am EXTREMELY disappointed because it looks NOTHING like the photo and the mats that I ordered with it DO NOT fit under it because it doesn't have the legs pictured in the photo! My daughter is a competitive gymnast and the beam that I received is too juvenile for her so now I will have to return it....what a disappointment!
2,Good band with a crap singer,"I bought this after i heard the band, Frost. The keyboardist is from IQ and wrote everything on the Frost cd. IQ is a really good band, but I get the feeling the vocalist is phony and loves the sound of his own voice. Sorry, this just didn't do it for me"
5,A MASTERPIECE!!!,"IQ is the Best Progressive Band out there, PERIOD!Everyone of their cds are brilliant!Ever is one of their best!BUY EVER & THEN BUY THEM ALL!!!"
1,Taylor failure,"I have had Taylor thermometers before. They worked quite well in all types of conditions. This particular unit, however, does not work. The fluid flows around the floats that are intended to measure the high and low temperatures. There is no way to re-set these floats... including freezing the unit or subjecting it to centrifugal acceleration. I am sorry that I will have to consider other brands in the future."
1,Save your money,"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers here. This thermometer is worthless. Mine had the maximum marker stuck in the colored temperature registering column. I managed to get it out eventually with a strong magnet, but once the temp heated up again, there it was stuck again. It never registered the maximum temp. The minimum marker would move with the column as it was supposed to. However, it would not stay at the minimum temp and would move right back with the column as it heated up. I noticed that the current temperature didn't seem very accurate either. So - doesn't register maximum temp, doesn't maintain minimum temp, and doesn't give current temp = worthless as a thermometer.I took mine back and got a Sper 736680 max-min for just a couple of dollars more and it performs like a champ."
1,They don't work,I bought two of the min/max 5460 thermometers for my greenhouse. The first one worked for only several weeks and then the floater sunk down into the blue fluid. The second was missing a floater. This is a worthless design. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased them.
2,for green house,does what I wanted it to do but it gets stuck often. have to use the attached magnet to reset
2,Very disappointing thermometer from Amazon,"I liked my last Taylor mini-maxi thermometer, so, when I needed one for my new greenhouse, I bought a Taylor again. This one has bad design (you are forced to grip it in such a way as to put pressure on the tube, easily pushing it out of the plastic retaining clips). The long vertical red button, supposedly for resetting, doesn't work. It has never worked. The magnet is difficult to get out of its storage space. One of the two black markers is now permanently stuck down in the mercury, and does not budge in response to the magnet. It would be hard to find a way to make a more worthless thermometer for those who need to know minimum and maximum temperatures over a 24-hour period."
1,it never worked,only works as a current-temperature thermometer: the bars that should indicate the previous highs and lows just go for a ride at the top of either end of the column. Or they get stuck within the high column. A total waste of my money and time.
1,A Waste of Time and $$,"Like others reviewing this product, I was disappointed. I ordered two, one was broken and the other one will not read temperature correctly. The bars indicating high and low temperature points have disappeared and I am unable to clear the airspace that has formed in the blue liquid. Construction is cheap and is below my expectations. I'll be returning these right away. . . ."
1,Disappointed,"Well, first my minimum-maximum thermometer didn't work right (the high side sticks) and then the vendor that sold it to me hasn't responded to my email (via Amazon) as to what my options are now. I can't give them a good rating."
4,this one's a classic,"fans of the business will enjoy this album. the songs have a harder edge than ""welcome to the real world"" and is pretty close to the sound of ""we want the truth..."". lyrics are of the standard street-punk/poliical stuff. the album holds classics like harry may, suburban rebels, blind justice, and drinking and driving. if you like to drink, sing along or are just a plain hooligan then get this album."
5,The KISS of Flag Design,"Having had the good fortune to work with communities across the United States designing flags, I am delighted to see this guide to effective flags in print. Kaye's brochure is condensed and illustrated common sense -- the KISS of flag design. Keep It Simple, Sir. Keep It Meaningful, Madam. Keep It Distinctive, Kids. Lose Those Words and Seals -- Everybody!You ignore the five principles of good flag design laid out in GOOD FLAG, BAD FLAG at your own risk. That risk: a messy flag, chock-full of words, symbols and colors, expensive to make and easy to ignore. Every great organization or community deserves a great flag, and this new booklet is just the ticket to designing one.Peter OrenskiTMEALF@aol.com"
4,Great Book,"This book is excellent. All the other reviews are dead on accurate.Just to add something different to the discussion...I would have given it five stars but for one thing. Occasionally the detail overwhelmed the writing and story telling aspect lagged. Just every so often it started to read like an after-action report. Don't let this put you off, just don't plan on being able to read parts of it right before bed time."
3,Great item... Sloooooow shipping.,"The rainstick looks and sounds great. Its way up there on the cool factor- the rough cactus finish in minimalist fabric band add to the effect. The stick itself is a 5+ star... The shipping was incredibly slow. It took these turkeys a solid week to tell me they got the order and were thinking of sending it... another week complete their thinking and decide to get around to actually sending it and then 5-6 days for it to arrive. Bottom line: if you've got a month to wait, this is a great item... otherwise look elsewhere."
3,leaks,"The sounds is great, but the rainstick leaks badly. I will have to use wood putty before I can use it."
5,Great Rainstick,"We purchased this for our 3 year old nephew and he loved tipping it up and down and listening to the steady sound. While the sound didn't last quite as long as I was expecting, you can easily vary the storm by tipping the stick slower or faster. I'm sure with young children it could quickly become a weapon of sorts, but it is a solid rainstick with a good sound for the price."
2,Difficult book.. there are better ones out there,"I studied japanese for 1 year before going to college and ending up with this book. I found it extremely frustrating. I can't figure out why the author wrote the book in romaji as opposed to japanese. There is good information in the book about sentence pattern and structure but I spent a majority of my time translating all the of the romaji sentences into hiragana so that I could actually read them. I feel it's much more beneficial for students to flat out learn hiragana/katakana/kanji at the beginning than trying to go through romaji. Several of the advanced students I know who started out with the ""Jordan"" method still cling far more to the romaji than is necessary and it is a hinderance to their learning. I recommend the ""Nakama"" textbook series or ""Japanese for Everyone"" textbook as much better alternatives to this book."
1,Don't buy this book or use it in your classroom!!!,"I have studied Japanese in one form or another at three different schools over the past three years with several different textbooks and I can honestly say that this is the worst textbook I have ever seen. Not only does it leave out the Japanese writing system, which is neccesary for learning how to read but the contents of the book are not useful in real world situations that would require one to interact with others. I would not wish this book upon my worst enemy and I beg any teacher that is thinking about using it to reconsider."
4,Great book,"I've been using this book for my Elementary Japanese class. Its a great book - starts from the basics and walks you through more advanced structures. It also mentions and explains the subtleties where ever applicable like. One example that i can remember from the book is the use of 'boku','watashi' and 'anata' - where to use it and where not to use it. I recommend this book for anyone who's starting with Japanese."
2,"Time for an update, and an eBook version.","Lots of good information, but, it's hard to find. This book's main purpose would be for use in class, I think - in class when the teachers give assignments it's almost always so hard to find what section they're talking about (unless it's a particular ""CC"").Another glaring problem is the use of the obsolete romanization system. This makes the book so unpleasant to use. Every single time I see ""si"" instead of ""shi"" or ""zyu"" instead of ""ju"" it's annoying and distracting. Makes it almost impossible to study productively. If I had an eBook at least I could correct the romanization without too much trouble.Add a ""section number""* to every SP, Drill, etc., update the romanization, and update the book to reflect modern times then it will get 4 - 5 stars.* What I mean is, instead of: Lesson 4, Part B, SP A, 3 - 4 it would be : Section 4.7 problems 3 - 4."
1,One of the worst text books I have ever seen,"My main problem with this series (besides the outdated vocab, and HORRID conversation tapes) is the way it keeps the student stuck on reading English. She goes out of her way to not make a connection with English, but in doing so spends way too much time talking about the grammar in English. It is difficult for students to understand, and those I've known who have only studied on JSL and then go to Japan have a incredibly hard time. There is a large gap between what is taught in JSL and what is actually useful in a conversation.As far as the romaji goes, her system of romaji makes perfect sense. However, if used in an intro college course that does not have a lot of student-teacher interaction, it leads to horrible pronunciation.Japanese: The ""Spoken"" Language does next to nothing in preparing students to actually speak the Japanese language."
5,A great textbook,This is an unabashedly great text. It is tough going and a bit painful too. But I built a very solid grammatical foundation with it that I find few foreigners have.I suspect that the periodic poor review that this series gets is just all about how tough a language Japanese is!Be sure to use her Kanji book simultaneously.
1,The Worst Way to Learn Japanese,"The Jordan system of learning Japanese has it's fair share of supporters, but anyone who has truly made Japanese an important part of their life understands why this book is not only unhelpful, but counterproductive. This system works entirely in romaji (roman characters), preventing the learner from seeing the language from a native perspective and retarding understanding of Japanese writing systems. As if that weren't bad enough, in place of the standard method of romanization Jordan has created her own, which is both confusing and unnecessary. It uses ""core conversations"" to simulate speaking in the language, but provides the learner with no ability whatsoever in creating original sentences. Do not buy this book! A much better choice for the beginning Japanese student is the ""Genki"" series."
3,Heavily linguistically oriented but thorough textbook,"Jorden and Noda's beginning Japanese text is quite different from the typical American intro language textbook. It eschews illustrations and rote exercises, rather focusing on the deep structure and linguistic terminology of learning Japanese, which is wonderful for professors, but potentially confusing for the non-linguistically oriented student. Since American language learning is based on visual principles and fun exercises, I cannot give this text a full rating. Also, the book's utilization of the New Standard System of romanization is confusing, since most Japanese texts and other surces tend to use Hepburn. However, on the other hand, if you ARE linguistically inclined, this is probably a superlative text for you. I would leave a cautionary note to professors to consider their American students' background before assigning this textbook for beginning Japanese."
1,Curriculum and Methodology VERY outdated,"I was forced to teach high school Japanese using this textbook for seven years. Both I and my students were unimpressed with the heavy emphasis on its audiolingual methodology. I had to supplement with my own materials for culture and kana/kanji writing. The entire book centers around grammar, not useful Japanese. The current ACTFL proficiency guidelines and National Foreign Language standards now stress task-based curricula used with a more modern teaching methodology that incorporates real-life situations and materials. The book does contain some weird Japanese that is only there to fit the grammar point. The videos are old and the sound quality is bad. If you want good, current Japanese that also includes culture (NONE in the Jorden method!) notes, go with anything put out by the publishers of the Nihongo Journal (ALC Press). No textbook these days is entirely in roomaji either. I gave this book one star for its usefulness as a grammar guide."
4,For the open minded,I just finished watching this video and was quite impressed with the amount of information presented. I've watched other docs on Egypt before but never one with this alternate view of it's history. My mind has been opened up to new possibilities to be sure.
4,A real treat,"Robert Bauval explains his theory, which is very convincing in my opinion, that ancient civilizations such as ancient Egypt were very well versed in astronomy. This theory makes a lot of sense to me, because primitive people seem to always incorporate astronomy into their various religions & ceremonies. Bauval is clearly an expert on this subject & has certainly done his homework. I was never bored, & would definitely recomend this to those that feel a connection with ancient Egypt as I do."
4,Good stuff,I have been using the 1.2.3 kit for close to 3 months now. I am really pleased with the results. Im not sure if it just me but the toner has done wonders for my skin. I see a better looking color in my face. It is deffintly not a girly product either the sents are not to noticible and dont smell like girls items.
3,Virtual diving,"This is strictly eye candy for fish watchers and nothing more. No narration at all so if you want information with your video you'd be much better off with Blue Planet. It's a montage of video from all parts of the world (although the locations are not identified). For the price, though, it's some nice video. I put some classical music on the stereo and watch this video with my morning coffee as a ""virtual"" dive."
2,Very tacky,I do not like this at all. It is very very tacky and the quality is very bad. Sometimes the volume is not stable.
3,Nice selection of pop nuggests,"This includes some cool stuff, such as ""Cuddly Toy (Feel For Me)"" by Roachford, which should have been a huge hit but wasn't (except for the UK). Also, ""State Of The Nation"" by Industry is a synth pop classic that is kind of rare."
5,Thief of love stole my heart,"This film is an absolute masterpiece. I saw the original production but it was even better on film - there are so many levels to appreciate this work, costumes, sets, and magnificent story, and the music is so well crafted and integrated into the story. A must see."
5,Super Classic,I grew up with this and it is still entertaining to me and you can't go wrong with the kids on this.
4,Warners has failed me too many times,"I will be holding off on buying this collection until I see with my own eyes that ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""His Mouse Friday"" among others, are released uncut on volume 2, if and when Warners decides to release it."
5,About time..........a complete collection?,"This is indeed terrific news, NOW, here's hoping that by now, they have finished restoring the Tex Avery Collection as well, and that THIS won't be too far behind them, one can but HOPE."
3,"Trust me, you're gonna be disappointed.","Right. These are brand-new restorations, sourced from great second-generation CRI elements which look much better with whatever you have seen on TV or past DVDs.Right. The original negatives of all shorts before 1951 are lost. In the case of Tom and Jerry, original negatives equals original title cards.But the good news is that back in 2009, the original titles of The Midnight Snack, Puss n' Toots, Mouse Trouble, The Zoot Cat and Fraidy cat were discovered by David Gerstein.The bad news, is that The Midnight Snack and The Zoot Cat are confirmed now to still be with reissue titles here.Right. These original titles are from private prints most likely. But Warner could and should have been convinced the owner/s to lend them. Warner are not a layman, they're a big corporation with a lot of money.So, if you look forward to see these titles:Trust me, you're gonna be disappointed."
5,AMAZING!,"I was SO happy to find this. Amazing color and clarity bring my favorite childhood cartoon to vivid life. Contains the first 37 episodes in release order. Can't wait for the rest, although I wish they would have released it as a box set rather than dragging the volumes out over a long time."
5,Love Tom and Jerry,It's so great to have these classic cartoons. I've watched them and I've laughed and giggled. They are so cute and just as I remember them. WB did themselves proud with this set of Vol 1. They are uncut and in order.
4,AWESOME!!!!!,genial recopilacion de los cortos animados de Tom y Jerry. una gran eleccion para los amantes de estos dibujos animados
3,Ira sleeps over video,Wasn't the best copy able to watch but was good enough for our classes to watch. There was some rolling durring the video. Had to try two different VHS players so it was less jummpy.
4,"Raw, unrestricted . . . Ginsberg's works of beauty",Ginsberg at his best . . . wait . . . when is he not?
2,Tiresome,"I find Ginsberg's poetry to be extraordinarily coarse, ugly, and narcissistic. The ubiquitous references to homo-erotic themes gets really old, and frankly I just don't quite get what the big deal is with this guy. Sure, it's always been fashionable among some people to be into the Beats and all that, but how many people have actually sat down and tried to read this stuff? Ginsberg is probably the most overrated poet in the history of this country, and maybe the planet."
5,brilliant,"Ginsberg's startling, erratic genius is on display in this alternately inspiring and exasperating volume. I give it 5 stars because Ginsberg MUST be read and appreciated; the man changed the face of poetry, as well as pop culture, holding enormous influence over Bob Dylan, who would reinvent rock and roll and help inspire a cultural revolution. Why Ginsberg was not awarded a Nobel is astonishing to me."
4,A vast and great compendium of Ginsberg's writing,"This might be the first life-changing book I encountered (Warhol, Borges and Nabokov would come later) - I actually (astonishingly, in retrospect) stumbled across both Ginsberg - this collection - and Ferlinghetti in the library of a North Carolina high school in 1986. I kept this book checked out for most of the school year, gradually committing vast chunks of it to memory.Ginsberg was raw, real, more than willing to be a mess in life and in literature, which is exceptionally humanizing, and the poems are, and always will be this vast something from the depths of the collective American unconscious - ""Howl"" and ""Kaddish"" most famously, but in less well-known, but no less wonderful pieces like ""Wichita Vortex Sutra"" as well.Fans of Ginsberg (or of the beat movement in general) will already know much of this, but this collection is much more than that - some of the most vital American writing of the 20th century.-David Alston"
1,Junk. Spend a little more for real quality.,"I got these (Blue, Large, from another source) just before a dive trip to Bonaire since they are lighter for traveling. After a week, the colored plastic part developed white stress marks and bent and twisted permanently. They did work well for finning, but weren't worth bringing home so I threw them in the trash. Another thing. I wear a size 10 1/2 but these large were flopping around so had to wear neoprene dive socks. Smaller size, too tight."
5,AWESOME Fins,"I bought these and went to Mexico for some snorkeling. They fit well (I wear a size 11 - 11.5 shoe depending on the brand) this size fit great. Not too tight, no loose spots, no toe overhang. The real deal is the smooth power! Head down a few smooth pumps and you are 20 feet down. The design really reduces fatigue. I was out in the water for hours and no cramps, no discomfort, I could have been out there all day."
5,Most efficient fing,"I've tried a lot of fins, and these give me the fastest sustained speed in the water. I wore out one pair of these, and got another pair to replace them."
3,woo ping,You never know what you are gonna get with this guy. He only directed my favorite movie ever---legend of a fighter. He also choreographed one of the worst movies---from china with death. I liked the 1st secret rivals much better and the guy who replaced don wong tao really ruined it for me. There is just too many stupid things that happened in this movie. I seriously wonder if Godfrey Ho took part in the writing of this movie.
3,ok but not great,"Hwang Jang Lee was the main reason I got this DVD. I had really high hopes since the reviews were pretty good. Well I didnt like John Liu, shouldve been ""Crazy Legs"" Yuen Baio. Now that wouldve been tight. Hwang Jang Lee was great but did not show his full talent. One of my favorite of all time is still ""Snake and the Crane"". Now that was an excellent movie. This movie was ok but not worth the price. Oh what killed it was the audio. Really horrible."
3,Could have been a larger text,"""National Interest"" is one of these phrases you always here. But few bother to rigourously define it. Frankel gives an explanation, grounded in the history of this concept. He shows how it can span from the military sphere to economic matters. And how it is tied into a nation's self image and ideals. Mythos, if you will.He could actually have made this the core of a much larger book. The issues raised here in such brevity bear greater scrutiny. But you do get a concise formulation of the ideas."
4,One of their best albums,"After listening to this CD, I couldn't help but hum the tunes in my head all day. It's my favorite of all 764-Hero's recordings so far. I recommend this CD to anyone interested in hearing mellow, yet driving tunes. Don't miss out!"
2,Sloppy sluggish slackers,"Was there a time I ever actually cared for this stuff? I think my love for Cursive was single-handedly responsible for all these generically gruff, indie emo off-ramps."
2,"Good, but overpriced","While I agree with the other reviewers that Rubino's material is good (but not new), the total listening time for all 6 cassettes is less than 3 hours. For 6 of the 10 weeks, you will get less than 14 minutes of guidance. If you think that you can learn all you need to know and do in the next week in 15 minutes or less, these tapes are for you."
4,Son Loves it I dont like it,"Great entertainment for my four year old. I think it is sooooo weird, but he seems to love it. He also enjoys playing with his beyblades after watching."
2,"Maybe Cleveland style, but not Yankovic","This CD just doesn't have the umpf of Yankovic, or Lipovac. The beat is a little too slow, and lacks the toe-tapping beat. The songs are redundant, bland, and boring. Growing up in Pueblo, CO, in the Slovenian area, and attending numerous polka dances with Yankovic, Seibert, and Lipovac, I was hoping for that kind of music that makes you want to dance. This CD just makes you want to take it back."
4,Great price for what you get,"Product arrived on time, the sheet protectors were a little lighter than I anticipated, but for the price you can't beat it. They get the job done."
4,Effective and Great - Does Exactly What It Should,"This product does exactly what you would - protect your important sheets of paper, you can fit more than one piece in each protective sheet which is nice if you have a multi-page school report or office presentation that you do not want to accidentally spill coffee on."
2,Too Boring,This book did not inspire me because it was too boring to read from the Introduction to whatever page I just gave up on it. I am sure it will inspire some women...I just wasn't one of them.
3,A nice browser,Listen it is actually a good manual to pick up before you open a restaurant for the third or fourth time.
1,overpriced and poorly supported,"well, own this door, and please don't buy it. many dogs are scared of the mechanism, and the complexity and problems still do not achieve the advertised weatherproofing."
5,"Beautiful, Inspiring","Having never read the Bodhicharyavatara before, I cannot be a good judge of the accuracy of this translation. However, I have found it the most beautiful and inspiring Buddhist text I've read to date. Buddhist or not, this book could transform your way of thinking and being for the better."
5,Truly Wonderful,Amazing how something written so long ago still holds true in today's world. I will go back to this book many times. I am fairly new to Buddhism and am fascinated by it. I just wish I had bought the book instead of downloading it to Kindle. The Appendixes are very good but having it on Kindle makes it a bit cumbersom to refer back to the stanzas. I highly recommend this book.
5,Great spiritual book--must read to wake up,I need this book and so do many others whether they know it or not! It's essential for one who is serious about the spiritual pathway.
2,Don't be fooled . . .,"I saw this CD in the store and saw that it apparently was a compilation of all of Teddy's hits. I have always enjoyed Teddy's music and was happy to see so many great songs on one CD, and at such a low price. Since it was created in 2005, I figured it was a re-master of the songs. Wow was I wrong! I guess it is Teddy singing, but the pace of the songs is slower and Teddy sounds tired. So despite the low price tag, I'm planning on trading this CD in at a local record shop and using the credit (hopefully they give me one) to purchase one of his CDs with the popular version of these songs. So don't be fooled."
5,Progressive Rock With A Dose Of Pop,"On IQ's second release with vocalist Paul Menel, the blend of pop with their standard progressive rock is obvious. For some fans of the band, the change probably wasn't welcome, but the music and lyrics make this one of IQ's best releases. Standout tracks include War Heroes, Wurensh, and two songs that actually make you want to sing along, Drive On and Sold On You. If you're a progressive rock fan that doesn't mind a little pop influence, this is the CD for you."
3,The Rest of the Story,"I had first read Meredith's two autobiographies, and found that Mr. Oates was able to fill in several gaps, especially about Meredith's first wife, who is never mentioned by Meredith. It is not nearly as well written as Meredith's books, and several typographical and grammatical errors called attention to this."
5,It's A Must Have!,"It's a must have! I have used it over and over and it has helped me with many ""problems"" I have had with using my Sony Vegas. This has not only helped with those problems but, shown me lots of neat little tricks to make my video making more professional."
3,wrong dvd delivered by Amazon.com. Be aware!!!,"Very helpful video with a lot of tips & tricks to use Sony movie studio. I've bought this video along with Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 11 Production Suite.I was disappointed however to notice that the DVD was not the updated version for Movie studio 11 but the movie studio 10 version. Since I'm not living in the USA it would cost me a lot to return the DVD, so I've decided to keep the DVD."
2,101 Tips and Tricks for Sony Movie Studio ~Wast of Money,"The DVD are a waste of money, all tips and tricks can be found on line with better search to find what you need at that moment, most by the same author. (Nice to know) DVD's have no way to ""Search"" what your working with at the time you need it, author expects you to watch entire DVD rather than using as reference. In all fairness they do have a chapter search sort of. Don't spend the money... Search on line, get the ""tip or trick"" for your project rather than wasting time and money. Search You Tube or just WWW. find what you need, when you need it...~Jack"
1,"Poor! very basic, obsolete, not much beyond the Users's Manual.","Don't spend $35 for this home made collection of video clips, you'd rather read the Vegas User's Manual.Vegas 11 HD comes already with Jump Start Tutorial DVD included...First of this home made collection of video clips is about Vegas 9.0 and 10.0, not about about 11.0!!!It is a HTML based web site stored on a DVD, with home made poor quality collection of video clips, about the basics of Vegas.He presents his preferred selection of setup, almost without explaining why. He repeats himself many times. He changed the appearance of Vegas 10.0 to look like Vegas 9.0 so that he could use old clips he had made for Vegas 9.0....Much of it describing the basic configuration, and positioning of element windows, and very little about actual rendering and real tips and tricks.."
2,I should have listened to that guy!,"I bought this product from another web-site, and I'm generally unimpressed. If it doesn't resolve itself in the next few days, I might return the unit.I like the heafty feel and satisfying clicks it makes while in use. However, it frequently (10-15% of the time) misfires and shoots 2 rounds subsequently. My unit already sticks after casual, indoor use, and the ""out-of-ammo"" stop won't halt the slider. If you don't watch, you have no idea you're out. = \"
3,Not bad for the money,"While I'd agree that the range of these units in typical conditions isn't 6miles, I tested it upto about 1 mile with a lot of stuff in the way (opposite sides of a hill).I'm not sure what the first post is taking about when it says ""high power mode"" - I assume that means the GMRS channels as opposed to the FRS ones, as this unit doesn't have a power boost function that I have seen.As I haven't had one of these radio's before, I don't know how it compares to others, but I think that it's common knowledge that the advertised ranges on all of these radios (not just Uniden ones) are the absolute maximum ranges in completely flat surroundings with line of sight (i.e. no buildings in the way)."
1,Where are Walkie Talkies ?,So delivery was fast.All happy i opened the box...the top was cut off....everything perfectly was sitiing inside besides walkie talkies themselves ? Joke ?
2,Short range walkie-talkie,"On high power, (supposedly 6 mile range), this unit is good for a half mile. On low power, there is very little difference."
1,Boring,False advertising you can see more graghic stuff on animal planet all the good parts are edited out. You see the big cats chasing down a prey then it goes straight to the part where everyone is chowing down not enough excitement for what was advertised.On top of everything the film quality was not very good.
1,Dont buy it,I was very disappointed with this video. 95% animals just walking around or sitting around. Pretty boring overall and would recommend buying anything but this video. It is not what the description would lead you to believe.
1,Do not buy this!!!,"This thing is terrible, completely terrible. A lion kills a hare is the highlight, but don't worry, if you miss it you'll get to see it again, five more times thoughout the DVD. Stuff is replayed over and over because they don't have anything worthwhile to show you. Complete trash."
1,Predators 2: Survival of the Fittest DVD-HORRIBLE!,"Sometimes When You buy a Bargain DVD(in my case at a best buy I believe) You get what you paid for, I should have gone for the National Geographic DVD but I did not, This DVD Has music played,Instead of being able to listen to Animals Roar, It is mismashed together,badly edited, and repeated,Not long enough scenes. waste of money."
5,Excellent for the money!,"I bought this on Amazon for $29 shipped as a lightning deal and for that price it is amazing. This is not the type of fogger that has low lying fog, although you could easily fabricate something to make that happen with this machine. The bottle of fog juice that comes with it alone is worth a third of the price I paid so when figuring that into the cost its like getting this fogger for $19! I checked out other local units and this one was faaaaar superior in its build quality. Most of the ones in my local Halloween stores looked and felt cheap and made with inferior plastics. The plastics and components in this unit seemed to be much sturdier and high end. If this is any indication of the type of products American Dj builds, I may solely buy from them for future entertainment purposes.Cliffs notes: Inexpensive, Top notch materials, great all around product, regular fog not low lying."
4,Foggin' A,"So I had an 80s party at my house and this fog machin was perfect since the dance floor was not so big. my only complain is that the pint of fog juice was not enough for the whole night, but then again it was a long night and I dont know if its normal for fog machines to waste as fast. Id say the fog lasted about 4 to 5 hours"
4,Not Bad for a $40 Fogger,"They key fact in evaluating this fogger is the price: for $40, you can't expect too much, but this unit still does a good job. I've used it for several small-venue parties (house celebrations, weddings, etc) and have gotten pretty good results. Once you let the machine warm up (many don't realize this, but yes, you have to wait for the machine to warm up) the fog does come out in large doses, and then sporadically throughout the evening as well. I personally found the included fog juice to smell really nasty, so I bought my own fog juice solution.It doesn't fill up a very big venue, but for $40, I find the value to be quite worth it. Best of all, the unit doesn't require too much power, so I can hook it up with other lights and effects rigs. The included foot pedal comes in handy.Hope this helps!"
3,It's okay i guess,I used this machine for a few months. at first it worked great. but as time went on it worked less and less and then it just stopped producing fog all together.so i threw it out.
2,Unit on its way back,"Well i use this for reason other then most probably, Im a photographer and i use smoke as a prop. Well i thought this unit would be great but unless mine was defective i was not impressed.Pros -The unit is small, portable, and professional looking.Cons -Takes 5 minutes to warm up ( which is fine) but it also has to stop every couple presses of the button to reheat, in my situation i cant have this. I need smoke when i need smoke :DNot sure if its the solution but this stuff dissipates FAST ! i could not even keep a small room filled in my home for more then 3-5 minutes without it being smokeless again. This is a HUGE problem for me because combined with the need to have to wait for it to heat and the speed in which the smoke disappears i would never be able to use this in an outdoor shoot which i do all the time.Needless to say i cant use it, perhaps its a great entry unit for DJ's and such, but for me not so much."
2,MINI FOG is the right discription,This product did not work as I expected. Very little fog only in a small area not at all what I wanted for Halloween. I guess I will keep it even through I should return it!
1,I just dont know what went wrong.,Bought this for around $40 USD got it home and plugged it in and it was fogging up the place like crazy. But then I started noticing that its duty cycle was inconsistent. Sometimes I could hit the fog for a good 30 seconds and sometimes I would be lucky to get 2 seconds out of it. Then one evening after work I came home to a puddle of what looked like fog juice on the floor. The fog machine had leaked all of the contents of the tank onto my floor. I have only had this machine for a week and it is not fit to do even one show.
2,Just OK,I would not recommend. Took a while for it to heat up. The sample fog juice did last for the night.
1,Awful,This product was loud and would only produce fog at random. Not what I was looking for at all. Don't buy this if you want to produce a lot of quiet fog when you need it.
1,Smells so bad and the fog does not stay on ground,"I could sense a strong chemical smell right when the fog came out. On the side of the fog maker container, it said that clear without smell or chemicals, but no it was not true at all. I used it once and i was done with it. The smell was too strong and the fog tended to go everywhere instead of sticking to the ground. The amount of fog released was good for a small room and that was the only good thing I could find from this fog machine."
2,Not a great saw.,"Not happy. I realize this is a very inexpensive saw, but I would not buy it even for a small DIY project. The fence is the real downfall of this saw. It is floppy and doesn't lock very well. It ruined more than one tile trying to do a shower wall. I am sending it back for a full refund and ordering a better one."
2,Still trying to get this to work,"I bought this saw about a month ago. Like one other poster, mine arrived looking like it had been kicked around quite a bit -- the box was bashed in, the unit was bent in a few places and I couldn't really tell if anything was missing because there is no packing list.Today I tried to set it up and use it. The very few assembly instructions refer to diagrams that are not part of the Owners Manual. I even went and found the online version and still no diagrams. I THINK I got the few things done that were were required in the Assembly Instructions. However when I turn on the saw to use it all I get is a buzz -- the blade doesn't move. I don't know if something jarred loose during shipping or whether I have missed an Assembly step. So I'm off to try Northern Tools customer service."
4,Wet tile saw,"I found the northern Industrial 7"" tile saw to do the cutting of ceramic tile for my kitchen countertop very satisfactory. I would recommend it if cost is the primary consideration"
4,Satisfied with the product.,I purchased a Northern Industrial Wet Tile saw from Amazon.com and used it to cut tiles for my kitchen backsplash. The item was delivered on time and was easy to work with. For the low purchase price the product perfomed reasonably well. I recommend this product for do-it-yourself projects.
1,Not the Best Approach to Education.,"This book is a joke! Kohl tries to convince educations that students have a high level of intellect when they make the conscious effort to ""not-think."" What? This is the exact reason why liberals should not be in the field of education. Every example Kohl uses is based on ""history classes"" and how the dominate culture (whites) have discriminated in teaching history. Perhaps, he's correct from that sense and we can balance out our teaching of history, but how does his theory apply to math or chemistry? Don't waste your money on this book!!"
3,Book review-I WONT LEARN,I really enjoyed this book. The author told of his life experiences of not wanting to learn as well as ethnic & culture diverse students that he taught. The book showed how Herbert Kohl really loved and cared about his job dispite the bias school system.
2,Inconsistent,"It was somewhat challenging following the purpose of I Will Not Learn From You. Some of the prejudices that people have, are indeed true. However, the author is not clear on the parameters of what causes some bright students to refuse to learn. He describes his own bias about not learning Yiddish as standing up for his mom. However, later on in the book he regrets this bad choice. Truthfully the feeling is that the author was not an open minded child. He adjusted somewhat as a teacher but I just can ascertain a message that the manis trying to communciate to his audience other than detailing some semi-interesting stories. Fortunately the book is under 200 pages."
3,Fair,This is a fair dress shoe. They leave wrinkles toward the front of your feel from walking. But classic and comfortable at the same time.
1,too hard to use,"My Mother, who has all her marbles at 103 and lives in assisted living, could not figure out how to use it without sliding off it. The staff at her well-run residence couldn't help her with it."
4,Excellent,"These goggles are excellent. They fit perfectly which does not allow any water to get through. The only issue I have had with them is that when they do get wet on the inside, you can rub them dry since they have a film inside."
5,Perfect!,"These are the best goggles for kids! Only one adjustment needed when they are new... then they are perfect for the rest of summer. Other, less expensive goggles require so many adjustments and the straps are always fallling off. Get these goggles and you won't hear, ""Mom fix my goggles!"" 100 times a day at the pool! The kids love them and never complain- a big plus!"
5,Excellent Goggles!,We had gone through three pairs of goggles each since last year for our children. They are on the swim team and none of the goggles would stay on them securely while diving in the pool. I overheard a mom telling another mom about the Hydrospex Jr goggles being the best goggles out there. I ordered a pair for each of my children and they work wonderfully! All three of them mentioned to me that these goggles are awesome. I would definetly buy these again in the future.
2,old model,The present model is not the newest available and it has the disadvantage of hurting the nose by prolonged use. The newest presentation has solved this problem.
5,Goggles,"While goggles seem to be a individual thing. My daughter has went through many styles and brands, these are the ones we keep going back to."
4,Great youth googles,"Both ,y kids, 3 and 6yo, are using these for their swim lessons. They work great. Remember if you are a parent and putting them on, split the band in the back one high, one low, and these googles will stay on when diving. To get 5 stars they would have to have an easier tightening mechanism."
3,"Downbeat but Comforting, worth buying","At the prices for a used copy of this CD on Amazon, you can't miss. After buying it several months ago, it went on the shelf and just now I was listening to [...]and heard Jana singing again. Really good stuff.Many solid songs. It's too bad Amazon doesn't have ""samples"" for this CD but if you create a ""Jana McCall station"" on Pandora you should get a few selections. I'll skip the adjectives used by other reviewers, except to agree that this CD is downbeat but somehow comforting. Appended: I wrote above review approx. 2 years ago and find this CD wears well, I'd give it ""5 stars"" if I could change them (but can't)."
4,Terrific!,"I love Clive Barker's written works (especially his books of blood) and really enjoyed this DVD based on one of his short stories (not sure which one and can't be bothered looking it up).Good movie, good gore, good god what ugly succibi though! Foul creatures that certainly are of the Clive Barker ilk.This chicks like to feed on men, and the monk is seemingly the only one who can stop him but he has doubts (religion, yawn!).Very enjoyable."
5,Kick ass tv to dvd movie,"A year or two ago, this movie was slated to air on the Scifi chanel... i was very excited, since it was produced by horror legend Clive Barker. I never thought that this would release to the public, since it was a tv low budget movie, but I guess I was wrong. Anyways, its about a stupid ass monk that releases 2 succubi. Gore happens almost right away, with a fellow monk getting his arm ripped off... So the monk, after releasing the demons, decides to track them down. He teams up with a cop investigating brutal murders. The two track down the succubi, and well, the story lauches from there... All I can say is this is a badass movie, and I know I'll be in line when it release to by it."
3,a ok movie for barker fans or horror fans in general,this was good and fun and creepy / weird in parts and i recommend to cronenberg or barker fansits quite bizare and creepy in places. some effect reminded me of cronenberg movies or even barker's movies
3,alright movie,"This movie was okay, but what's with the evil sister that kept drinking from the intestines of their victims."
3,A good book for those who are Kael-hungry.,"Pauline Kael gave us hundreds of excellently written and thought provoking movie reviews, and yet since she retired from The New Yorker, there is still an intense yearning to hear what she has to say about recent movies. One never wants her to stop writing. This book is an entertaining collection of articles and interviews that were collected through the years, many of them taken from hard to find magazines. The wonderful thing that this book shows about Pauline Kael is that she talks almost exactly like she writes--an interviewer may ask her a relatively simple question, and she'll answer in her ever-playful way that will take up at least a half page of text. She has a terrific sense of verbal rhythm as well as her famous ""conversational"" writing style. Those who are new to her work should read her ""Deeper Into Movies"" and ""Reeling"", the two books that cover what she feels is the most innovative period in film history--the early to mid-seventies."
5,One of my childhood favorites,"I read this book as a young girl and loved the story. I am now reading it to my kids. It's a great way for children to be able to imagine life as a settler. And, it's a fun story!"
3,Expensive Perfume,"I was very excited to try this product, it seemed to get rave reviews everywhere I looked, so I was more than happy to pay such an expensive price because I was expecting to see it work.Since I've bought it I've attempted using it a few times in a few different settings, and nothing really seems to occur differently than usual. I even put it on around my boyfriend of two years and he still acted the same way.Much to my disappointment, it really seems like nothing more than an overly expensive nice smelling roll on perfume.It has a nice flowery scent, but as far as the dosage of Pheromones goes, it doesn't seem like enough to give the effect so many people rave about."
2,does it work?,"I have yet to notice any difference when wearing it - I wasn't expecting people to fall over themselves but some change would be nice - I wore it for a few days straight, but nothing."
3,I tried this a couple years ago.,"Hey everyone. I tried this a couple years ago and bought it off Love Scent. It was actually my first pheremone I ever tried and perhaps my inexperience at the time lead to my failure, but Scent of Eros did very little for me.It smelled lovely and actually made me calm! But my social interactions in general had no difference. I'm always a cheerful and warm person so it's not like I have trouble socializing and I think I look pretty nice, hehe!But SoE gave me no change other than a perfumed scent and a calmness in mood (which I really did appreciate, a sniff of the bottle and ahhh~ But that wasn't what I bought it for!) I've had vast success with other pheremones so I think it's just a matter of SoE not conforming to my chemistry.I ended up returning it. :( May work great for others, but just wasn't for me."
4,Scent of Eros for Women,I love this product. It works well on my husband. He is much more friendly and mellow when I am wearing it.
1,Smells Like A New York City Subway,"I just received Scent of Eros two days ago. It smells disgusting. Against my better judgment, I ignored the other reviews that mentioned the strong urine smell of this product. The scent is there in the bottle and on the skin. It took an hour of rubbing my skin with an alcohol soaked cotton ball to rid myself on the stench. Thank goodness, I was smart enough to use this at home first.It is important to note, that I cannot comment on the effectiveness of the product. Maybe it works and maybe it doesn't! However, I don't need to smell like a NYC subway station to attract men. There are better products out there just do some research."
4,Nikita,"It's expensive for its size, but it gives me good effects with my friend:-) I would buy this again."
1,i don't like it!,"I hate the smell..It smells good at the beginning, but soon you will stars stinking like baby urine.Too much money for a little bottle of smelly urine."
1,I think its funny....,"How NOBODY has written a review for this book. Maybe no one's bought it. Sounds like another liberal crying about war & how bad it is.I agree that the Iraq War is maybe ""mis-managed"" but honestly, who has a degree in War Management? (Although the intellectual enlightened at our Universities should be able to create one, eh?)About the book, didn't read it, I probably won't, and wouldn't recommend it to someone I DIDN'T like. Just sounds too much like a sniveling, ""wah-wah"" conspiracy Theorist that hates America but loves to live here in freedom to shout his mouth off."
2,Stormbringer by Deep Purple: Very Disappointing,"I bought this album a while back. I was expecting a follow-up to the very promising BURN. I was sorely disappointed. This album was very underwhelming, to say the least. With the exception of the songs STORMBRINGER, & SOLDIER OF FORTUNE, this album is probably the weakest Purple album with Richie Blackmore in the line-up. This is also the last studio recording of Purple with Blackmore in the band before splitting with them & forming Rainbow. Blackmore's guitar work is probably very muted in this release. It sounded like he didn't give a damn in this album. Gone was the passion & fire that was present in the early Purple albums. Too bad, really. STORMBRINGER was a massive letdown."
5,Excellent Album !,"The ""lost"" Deep Purple Album. Excellent Blackmore Guitar Album ! Buy It, worth every penny !"
1,They can't do it right!,"Next time an old geezer tells you how great, epic, wonderful was the prog rock of the 70s, remind him of two songs which came about the same time: Zeppelin's ""Trampled underfoot"" and DP's ""You can't do it right"", which, unfortunately, happens to be in the album we are reviewing. Yeah, this is what all those old heroes of rock produced trying to jump into the disco craze bandwagon.If you haven't bought Stormbringer yet, pleeeeeease save yourself while you still have a chance."
3,A turning point for the band,"I always thought this album marked a turning point for Deep Purple. On their previous albums, the one thing that predominated was a sense of fun and of not taking themselves too seriously. That faded on this album, which takes itself far too seriously. And the ""shrill"" factor began its rise on this album too. Several of the songs (especially the vocals) sound suspiciously like forerunners of AC/DC to my ears.That's not to say the album is all bad. I sure listened to it a lot when I was a teenager, and I still like hearing some of the songs today. But this isn't a CD I pull out to listen to on a regular basis. File it in that category of, say, Kansas and Foghat and of course AC/DC, and the lower-grade Uriah Heep and Robin Trower albums. Stuff that I never really liked, but didn't realize it until I was a bit older and began casting a more critical eye on the music I listened to."
3,Ehhhh.....3 and a half stars.,"Stormbringer is an OK album. I listened to the title track and expected the same style of rock for the whole time, only to hear much more soul/funk than anticipated. For this I blame Glenn Hughes. The only other notable tracks for me are ""Lady Double Dealer"" and ""Soldier of Fortune."" The other tracks are alright, but as a whole the album doesn't hold my attention as much as Burn. Not my favorite, but OK for a listen once in a while. Good for those who prefer the softer side of Purple."
3,Mediocre,"""Stormbringer"" is an okay album, it's just not very memorable, and three stars may actually be a bit too generous.It's not that the songs are bad, but most of them lack the hooks and the riffs that made ""Fireball"" and ""Machine Head"" such great records, and a lot of this material just sort of passes you by without really being noticed.There are couple of good songs here, like ""Lady Double Dealer"" and the excellent ballad ""Soldier Of Fortune"", which is still a part of David Coverdale's repertoire, but all in all, ""Stormbringer"" is for the serious fan, and it is certainly not recommended as your first Deep Purple purchase."
3,Stormtroopers of ks,"Ritchie sounds bored out of his mind on a good two thirds of this; still some great stuff in the margins; cool endings, blistering solo, synergistic verse, with a very classy finale, and just shows how much better lukewarm was in the 70s ompared to what came after."
2,What were they thinking?,"Wow, I had forgotten that even Deep Purple and David Coverdale could lay a massive egg. This disc is horrible. If one needs an example of Deep Purple, nearly any other album will do a much more accurate representation. Not that this is not the original band in ""Coverdale"" form, they just seem to have gotten full of themselves and dropped this goose egg into the listener's birthday cake. This sounds like an overly-orchestrated attempt to sell out, put out the 'pop'. Coverdale is not to blame as is easily heard on the ""Burn"" disc, ""Stormbringer"" has no direction and is executed without conviction. The production quality is just as uneven. A track-by-track analysis is not possible as one track will poison an attitude for any other track. Just don't."
3,not bad,"A different album was sounded quite diferrently by Deep Purple incarnation Mark III line up,...the songs are not the same as DEEP PURPLE mark II line up,..alittle bit Funky , Bluesy, were bounded with a hard rock traditional DP sound. Good compositions between COVERDALE, HUGHES, Blackmore...."
4,"Stormbringer, the beggining of the end","Excellent album, everytime I listen to it I ended speechless, an album with one of the legendary Deep Purple's lineups, a very special album for it contents, the last with Ritchie Blackmore(until Perfect Strangers almost a decade later), one more thing that made this album special: is not an album you see often at record stores, like Machine Head, In Rock or Burn. Great record, I truly recommend it."
3,For older children than who I bought it fo.r,This book is not just a preschool or kindergarden book. It is more for older kids who know how to read and already know their ABC's and are learning more about cajun culture.
4,Fast Service,I received my batteries as ordered in the stated length of time. Just in time for a Christmas gift. Thanks!
5,Just a terrific read,"It has been a very long time since I have been compelled to stay up until 3 am to finish a book but I just couldn't put it down. Had I known I would have started the book much earlier in the day! Wonderfully insightful, fantastically funny with some moving moments and written in an easy flowing style that just leads you from page to page. While I do not own the book I am very tempted to not return the book to the library =o)"
5,Excellent Confidence Builder,This audio book was one of the best I have ever listened to. It was very informative and keeps you on your seat to learn more.
2,Hard and bland...,I purchased a box of these at the store and found them to be hard and bland. The texture was very dry- like sawdust. I could not give them away. Stale and hard from the moment I opened the box. I was disappointed. I love oatmeal cookies... But these were awful.
1,Don't waste your money,This is extremely poor value and the most disappointing digital transaction I have ever made. The figures are missing from the text and there is truly nothing of any substance in the article. I believe people still want serious value for $6 and considering the time involved in just purchasing this article I am in a deficit situation. This should never have been placed for sale. Doesn't Amazon have an editor?
4,The Broken Bubble (non-SF) - how it connects to PKD SF,"The name of the protagonist (don't know exactly which it is, don't have my copy at hand) is a name that appears in some Dick stories, and I guess in Blade Runner (someone please correct me if I err). The used car dealer reappears in a somewhat different setting in The Simulacra.Maarten Daams"
5,Cheever is the best,"Honestly, I have never really heard much about Cheever until I took a Literature course at my college. When I started reading his stories, I could not put it down. Each story is different in a sense that it will lead you somewhere where you did not think it will go. Some stories have morals, some are sad, some have allegories that will not be understood by every reader, and some have characters that you will hate, but still, all the stories are unique in their own way. My favorites were ""The Swimmer"" ""Torch Song"" and ""The Country Husband"". Cheever is simply the best and I can not recommend it enough. I am not huge fan of short stories, but these I liked a lot.These are short stories, meaning that you will not be wrong in a way you interpret it. Different thins have different meaning to people, making it even more fun to read since you can see the story the way you like it, not necessarily the way the author wants you to see it."
3,Sorry to be negative,"I wanted to like this work but kept feeling myself getting irritated. Cheever has a remarkable knack of repeating sections of dialogue a little too long, or putting passages of text the wrong way round. Almost without fail I was frustrated with the construction of a story; ""How much sharper, more satisfactory,"" I thought to myself, ""if he had put this section before (or after) the other one!"" And if I can see that...When I purchased this book I can only assume that I mistook Cheever for Raymond Carver, who (if I'm correct in my assumption) I've read before and liked."
5,The best book ever,This collection is intense and relatable. I have been reading and rereading this book for years and I always discover new things to love. The writing is crisp and minimal.
5,The best of Shady Hill and Bullet Park.,"John Cheever, though also a novelist, is best known for his many short stories depicting American suburbia in the 1950s and 1960s. This book contains the best of those stories, many of them set in the fictional neighborhoods of Shady Hill and Bullet Park. He takes ordinary events such as the purchase of a new radio or a son's meeting his father for dinner, and injects them with humor, wisdom, and even tragedy. Many of the stories are set in Italy, where Cheever lived for several years, thus proviidng an interesting contrast to the suburban American way of life. Anyone who likes reading short stories should own a copy of this book"
4,Excelente!,"Hice mi primer pedido en Amazon: esta joya de Chever. Me llegó enseguida, a los pocos días, en perfecto estado. Muy bien!"
3,Lots and Lots of Cheever,"Like any large collection of short fiction (and here Cheever's stories weight in at 693 pages in my edition) there is a great deal of material here that is of marginal quality. But for the reader who can hang on through Cheever's innumerable attempts to hammer out the same themes with relentless consistency (the rented summer home, the failed vacation, the desperate office manager, the expatriate in Italy living a dream of surreal desperation) this work is well worth reading for the surprises one encounters along the way. Cheever surmounts himself at some points; some stories reach a sublime level which is only hinted at in the less successful attempts. For writers, the large-collection-of-short-stories- taken-from-a-life-time-of-writing can be instructional texts. How do we retell our Ur story in new and refreshing ways? How do we surmount our own story, to get at something both more primal and more novel?"
5,As close to perfect as American literature gets,"These stories are the most wonderful things I've ever read. This book impresses itself upon you and takes you, if only for awhile, back in time, to the New York that his characters knew. They (his characters) are people of extreme sophistication, intelligence, grace, beauty, wealth, and priveledge, but are no less human than you or I. They are just parts of this collage about the ironies of everyday life. Buy this book. The awards and renown it has received can't lie- The Stories of John Cheever ARE some of the best short stories ever published by an American, including Poe, Hawthorne, and Fitzgerald. It is perfection."
3,A Few Gems But Most Go Nowhere,"I don't quite understand why this collection was a best seller that brought in so many awards. Cheever's stories are more often than not inadequate and simple. There was one I liked a bit and while its name escapes me, it was about a middle-age crisis in a man manifesting in his attraction to his child's babysitter and culminating in the near extinction of his marriage. Of all the tales I read in this volume, and I read better than half the total, that one was the best, and yet it, too, contained a quality of shallowness. It reminded me it and all of Cheever's short stories could have used another draft or two before they went to press."
2,"Review of quality of shipment of ""The Stories of John Cheever.""","Because of too-thin shipping packaging, this book arrived with damage to the front cover: it sustained half-inch tears on the top and bottom next to the spine, along with wrinkling and folding on the lower part of the cover."
4,A good surprise at an old age,"I started reading American writers around age 15,at first in Italian an then in their language . Now ,60 years later , I considered myself up to date on contemporary American writers . But fortunately I am a self taught reader and there is no method in my selection of authors .This allows me to discover for the first time John Cheever at age 75 and to be surprised by a new way to tell a story , by a different look on the pains involved in being alive and on our ability to dream of paradise but actually vote for hell .I love John Cheever and I know I will be going back to this book many times ."
5,Americana to a tee,"I love this book. Cheever relates the differences and subtleties between classes in a timeless fashion. Most of theses stories take place in New York City in the 30's and 40's but the distinctions made between classes resonates today. The longing of the lower and middle classes for money, the unhappy stagnant upper classes; Cheever just nails it. Some stories are gruesome, some are candid explorartions of the longings of a family or an individual for more, and some are even upbeat realizations that the good things in life are available for everyone no matter what class, no matter how much money. Cheever doesn't moralize, he notices; and very accurately at that. Most of the stories in this volume can be read in less than an hour which is nice if you have a hectic family life."
2,Whom exactly is this for?,"The diehard Devo fan already has these tunes, and the casual fans won't be swayed by the selection here. Now, you won't find a bigger Devo fan than me, but I think this is a very misguided collection. If they wanted to reel in the hardcore Devotees, they could have included SOO BAWLZ or TURN AROUND or GROWING PAINS, none of which was available on CD at the time. And if the goal really was to present ""great misses"", or songs that could have been hits, why not include a SNOWBALL or a SECRET AGENT MAN or an ARE YOU EXPERIENCED? As is, you've got mostly album cuts, (including far too many from the DUTY NOW FOR THE FUTURE LP), with a token couple of previously unavailable tracks for the serious fan. If you're on the fence with regard to buying this CD, and you already own Warners' GREATEST HITS, I'd suggest you buy any of Devo's first four studio albums. Each is chock full of nuggets famous and infamous and will be much more satisfying than this mishmosh."
3,Not Enough Variety to Sustain It,"DEVO spent a great deal of their wonderful career tweaking and tinkering. So for ""Misses"" to be almost half comprised of selections from the first two albums doesn't really give an overview of their reach as a band. Granted, it's ALL good MUSIC. Just not a good overview. This DOES make a good companion piece to ""Greatest Hits,"" and the liner essay is written in two parts. How much you need it depends on how much DEVO you already own."
1,Should be called the worst of Devo,The title says it all. This album might only be enjoyed by ensane or drunk people who have no clue about good music. This shows you how low record companies will go to sell bad music. It's not even half as good as their greatest hits.
3,"calgon, take me away..","Insides' first album was much-better-than-average 4ad fare, with tasteful electronics, pleasant female vocals, and some of the most dysfunctional lyrics I'd heard in a long time. I bought this expecting something similar. Wrong-o.This is a forty-minute single track of minimalist instrumantal music. It's very well done, reminding me of Terry Riley's ""In C,"" or Reich's ""Music for 18 Musicians,"" but lacking in the rythm department. It changes, but very slowly and gradually. Not much for close listening, but still very good background music."
1,Unexpected and Disappointing,"I think this book should be rewritten or not be distributed at all. It still uses the word ""negro"" to identify a black person. I find it extremly offensve and insulting."
2,Just okay,"I purchased this high chair as part of a 5-piece system. I was obsessed with having everything match; this high chair is why that thought process may not be the best when choosing items for a new baby/infants. The highchair is decent enough, but I have found that the cover does keep coming off and I would like something more sturdy for my active 5 month old who will get much more active before he's out of a high chair. That is why I will either move this high chair to my mom's house or sell it, but I am DEFINITELY purchasing another for our everyday use."
4,Good for the price,"I think this chair serves for its purpose. The tray is a little to big, and it moves very easily on tile floors. For a curious baby, I would prefer something with a better grip, but this highchair is good for the money."
4,Great cheap high chair,"We ordered this chair for a cheap version while living abroad, and planned on purchasing a wooden version when we move back home. However, it's been great, and I may just wait and see how it holds up before buying a second. The only things I don't like are: the leaning aspect of the seat back feels a little cheap, as if it may get out of place easily. Also, the tray has a tendency to pop off easily, so you have to make sure you've put it in place. The tray is almost impossible to maneuver with one hand, but that is 90% of high chairs. Lastly, the ""fabric"" part of the seat is a bit big and things get under it easily. I have to check under it regularly to ensure nothing gets left in there.Other than that, it's great. It's very lightweight, has a cute pattern, and is super easy to clean. The belt has tons of room for bigger/older babies. I also like the slide-out tray for feeding, so little fingers can't get into the food. Overall, great product for the price!"
2,day-care provider,"The chair is not portable, and does not fold up for storage. I wish I had ordered a different one."
3,good enough for the price,"this chair is fair for its price. Pros: easy to assemble, easy to clean, accomodates small and big children. Cons: pretty large/bulky/quiet heavy, not too confortable for the baby."
3,high chair,"This chair is big, and takes a lot of space. Dfficult to assemble. One of the tie down tabs that holds the seat cover down was damaged, so it does not keep the cover in place. The tray popped off with just a little pressure from the top. Glad my grand daughter was strapped in!"
2,Recline Feature Does Not Hold,"I have used this high chair since my daughter was old enough to sit upright. She is now 28 months. Overall, the chair has done its job, but my major complaint about it is that my daughter quickly learned if she forcibly throws her weight back in the chair, it will ""recline"" on its own, or the chair slips out of its upright notch and clicks down another level - she does it multiple times until it is fully reclined even though I want her upright. She is basically slamming her little body against the chair to achieve this effect. My other complaint is that the vinyl cover is ripping at the sides, but overall I think vinyl is a much smarter choice in a high chair than fabric (my other Graco). I wouldn't buy this chair again because of the recline not holding, I think that could be unsafe."
5,Love it!,"I just received this item in the mail the other day, it was so easy to put together and is perfect for our son. It reclines which is nice, also has a easy to clean seat cover that is so easy to wipe off. The extra tray is also very nice. All together my wife and I love this product!"
5,the right chair for the right price,I just got the chair today it was very simple to put together had no problem with it. the chair is big but we have the room.its the perfect chair for just the right price no need to waste your money on over priced high chairs.
2,mount vernon mom,"I recently purchased this piece and I must say that I am not impressed. I do not think that it is sturdy enough, and the seat cover keep sliding off. To be honest with you I would have returned it for something more efficient for my active 10 month old, but just the thought of taking it apart and returning it wouldn't be feesable."
2,Too large for Grandma's House,"I bought two of these high chairs because of the price and the cute cow print covers. We have twin granddaughters that we see frequently so needed something sturdy. The chair does not fold for storage, has a wide footprint so adults & children trip over the legs and the seat cover does not attach securely. The chair is all molded plastic and cleans up easily.I don't like that the chair doesn't adjust in height to use at the dinner table or lower to the floor. My chairs are going on the next garage sale and I've ordered two folding compact chairs. My advice-don't waste your money unless you are on very tight budget. Some of the advantages of the more expensive ones are well worth it. I wish I had spent a little more the first time instead of learning the hard way now."
4,Cow Patch Highchair,"This high chair is great. Very sturdy, comfortable, easy to assemble (i did it myself) and easy to remove cover for washing. The only flaw was that when I received it i was missing a very important piece, part 2 of the seatbelt so now I can not leave her unattended for a second. I know it is not amazon's fault it's the manufacturers fault (Graco). But besides that, it is a great seat and I would definately recomend it."
4,Great Highchair,"The best feature of this chair is the wide tray. My son can see to feed the dogs and most of the goodies stay on the tray! I think it is sturdy, but I don't have a climber. The seat comes off easy to rinse."
3,great for the price but too big for small spaces,"This is a great highchair for the price. Sure, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles as some of the more expensive chairs, but it gets the job done. That said, it is HUGE! We have a very small kitchen and didn't realize just how gigantic the tray is. The benefit is that toys don't go flying off as easily, but it really is excessive. We downgraded after using this for 3 months to the Fisher Price healthy care booster which makes much more sense in a tiny, eat-in kitchen (although it's tray seems microscopic in comparison)."
2,"Not quite as good as ""Side Out""","This movie is for people who are interested in a ""based-on-a-true-story"" account of the 1984 USA Volleyball team. There's a bad-boy character based on a few of the players who were ultimately cut from (or quit) the team prior to the Olympics, and then there's the good guy, based on Karch Kiraly. The actors unfortunately had no idea how to play volleyball, and it showed. (Monroe Clark's final set looked pristine compared to some of these... attempts)The actor playing the guy based on Kiraly was also a tad shorter than most real players, and so they had to use a mini trampoline to boost him up to a height where he could be a ""Spiker"". It's pretty amusing to watch, actually.It's basically a terrible movie, but if you enjoy volleyball, it's great fun to watch and have a laugh."
2,A double face DVD,"This is a DVD with a good video quality, devoid big MPEG' s compression imperfection. Unfortunately the audio' s section propose an imperfect Dolby Digital 5.1 track. In fact the central channel don' t contribute to create a large resonant forehead, but it play in an undertone."
3,Better than I expected,"I have the Metropolitan Opera's performance on CDs but I couldn't find it on DVD, so I bought this one instead. I like this DVD after watching it because the singing is not bad at all, and the sound and video qualities are very good, except the makeup - pretty much like the movie 'William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet'. Plus, there is not so much noise from the audience. One more thing that makes me feel disappointed is the short pause before the end of Act II, due to the change of DVD layer."
2,A completely useless piece of junk,"This scanner is OLD. The technology is old, the support from HP is dreadful. The scanner has constant problems of not being recognized by my computer, not working correctly with the document feeder, and the HP software is SO badly designed. For just a few more bucks, you can actually buy a new scanner that would work.For ADF, look at the newer, cheaper, all-in-one devices. Separate scanners with ADF are just not being made except for very high end work.This scanner doesn't even have scan-to-PDF; instead it uses tiff imaging, creating HUGE files. The provided viewer software works, but the print option in it doesn't - you'll just get a black sheet of paper printed. You have to go to another (non-HP) program to print your scans. And multi-page tiff is a bear to work with.Any scanner now will have multi-page PDF support; that is ESSENTIAL if you are archiving documents. Don't settle for anything less."
1,Baaaaaaad,"We use this HP 5550c scanner at my work. Or rather, we attempt to use this scanner at work.The 5550c scanner jams whenever we try to feed more than two or three pages at a time. Then the feeder has a deathgrip on the document when you're trying to pull the document out.We've been scanning our checks at work before electronically depositing them. It's scary when you almost rip a check because the stupid scanner won't let go of it.Basically, it's a horrible waste of your money. Everyone in my department HATES it. We can't wait to replace it!"
5,Excellent book on handcut dovetails,"I have plenty of articles and books on cutting dovetails by hand. I have dutifully followed the steps, instructions, etc. provided yet my dovetails are still not as good as I would like them to be. However, Kirby's book is the first one that explained the basics in a clear form, provided a good set of steps and REASONS behind why things are done in a certain order.After reading Kirby's book and following his techniques, my dovetails are far better. I also bought a copy for my brother, and he too likes this book alot."
2,Too much technical stuff to consider,"While I love Kirby's book on Sharpening using waterstones, this one is almost 180 degrees for me. It is so specific to one method only, you can only gain info if you follow Kirby's way. I found the layout and application sections too full of fluf and it didn't keep my attention. I'll admit that I'm a pins first kind of person but was willing to be objective.Obviously only my opinion, but it's just too technical for something that isn't nearly as complicated and ""magical"" as some would like to have you belive. I almost resited the former mentoned book on sharpening when I saw Kirby was the author, but that one I found indespensible - go figure. I give this one two stars because I'm sure the info is valid, I just can't stay with it long enough to glean anything useful from it."
1,Not for my cat,"I ordered this product for my ferel cat as it was advertised as being a excellent for outside cat with an insulated floor. When it arrived, there was a pad that had to be inserted for insulation and you would have to buy another product to totally insulate it. The product itself was very thin plastic--not what I wanted for a ferrel cat living outside--totally not warm enough. Not happy with product and was returned immediately! When called to return, was told to send to wrong place--not happy about that either. The KatKabin is overpriced and the return policy is also not what I expected from Amazon."
1,My cats won't even try this....,"I bought one of these 2 years ago for some outside feral cats and not one of them would even check it out. It is too small and when you add the foam pad that comes with it this makes it even smaller and claustrophobic. Very cute, but very expensive and just plastic. Waste of money for me."
1,Will not play CD-R,"If you make your own audio CDs at home, don't buy the Sony units. Sony decided to leave the capability out of their units to play CD-R. I bought one, got it home and learned the lesson the hard way. I returned the unit for a refund. Buy the Pioneer, Phillips, JVC or Denon units that will play CD-R."
1,Poor reliability,I have owned my DVD player for 2.5 years. It won't play most of my DVDs and skips on the ones it does play.What a disapointment from the company you trust for product quality!Stay away from this product!
2,Disappointed,"I have owned this DVD player for less than 2 years. Within the first 6 months it was in the shop for repairs to the laser. Now it will run for about half of the movie and start skipping and eventually stop playing all together. I have noticed that it gets very hot, and if I turn it off for a while it will work fine once again. This gets very annoying if you are in the middle of a good movie. Warrenty is out of date after a year.The DVD player is also very sensitive to the littlest scratches. I can play the same movie on a portable DVD player without any problems.I bought this player for all the features, and I thought Sony would put a better product together. It also looks good with my other components.I am now looking for another DVD player, and I am probably not going to buy a Sony.Avoid this player at all cost.Be aware that this player comes in alot of Sony stereo sets."
2,Not A Great DVD Player!,"If there is one thing I've learned in regards to electronic equippment it is not to trust Sony.Again I was right.This Sony DVD Player has a unbelievable amount of features.Including S video components,3D Virtual Surround modes,4.3/16.9 aspect modes,a built in Dolby Digital 5.1 decoder,and the ability to hold up to 5 discs at a time.Unfortunently,the player suffers from severe unreliablity.It breaks down very easily,it cannot play CD-R or DVD-R discs,and the Dolby Digital 5.1 performance is crap compared to what even the cheapest DVD Player can offer!"
3,Could Have Been Better,"The idea of a sort of loose homage to some of the greatest jazz pianists in history is a fine one, and the song selection is brilliantly diverse. Tyner can evoke a lot of different styles without falling into the imitation trap, and he plays with commitment and verve throughout. But that sledgehammer left hand of his is becoming something of an affectation. Too often the heavyweight approach to the bass lines on several songs makes it difficult to concentrate on the rest of the music. Though such effort is often rewarded, especially on the pieces dedicated to Corea and Jarrett respectively, the overall impact of the interpretations is compromised by Tyner's port-side pounding."
1,"Rare, Expensive, But Worth All Cost","Many Maiden fans remember the original Maiden Japan ep from back in the early 80's. Even then it was hard to come by. The ep only had five tracks running in this order:1 Running Free2 Remember tomorrow3 Wrathchild4 Killers5 Innocent ExileThe cd issue is very nice, remastered and expanded to 17 tracks!1 Wrathchild2 Purgatory3 Sanctuary4 Remember Tomorrow5 Another Life (w. drum solo)6 Genghis Khan7 Killers8 innocent Exile9 Twilight Zone10 Strange World11 Murders in the Rue Morgue12 Phantom of the Opera13 Iron Maiden14 Running Free15 Transylvania (w. guitar solo)16 Drifter17 I've Got The FireWow! What a collection of early Maiden...all performed by the original band! I still prefer the Beast Over Hammersmith set, but only because I lean towards Bruce. But Maiden Japan is totally worthwhile, even if it costs too much."
1,The loudest Miles Davis ever. Horrible.,"I own four Miles Davis DVDs and many of his CDs, so I can say I know him pretty well. This DVD contains what I think is by far the worst music I have ever heard him play, from the Fifties to his death. John Scofield in particular is unbearably loud. Good money gone down the tubes. Forget this one and buy instead Live in Munich."
3,Just O.K,"To listen to Miles perform is a pleasure. To see him perform on this CD is o.k. I am not a big fan of Miles but I thought this DVD could have been produce much better. Except for the cuts ""Human Nature & Time after Time"". This CD is o.k. Nothing to bragg about"
1,Can't agree with other reviewers.,"Folks, Miles went a little on the exploration side towards the 70's and 80's and it really didn't get him anywhere. I just cannot agree with the other reviewers in saying that this is a ""must have"" for any Davis fan... This is ""smooth jazz"" at it's best and easily avoidable. Look, to even think that something on this order could be compared the landmark album's such has Kind of Blue, Sketches of Spain...etc....that's unheard of!!! Please, if you want to support Miles, go buy one of his CD's....the beauty of Davis is that you do *not* have to watch him to appreciate his skill.......just listen......that's why we have ears...."
1,Horrific,Miles Davis legacy from when he was a much younger lad never translated to good performances when aged. This DVD literally blows. It is the single worst performance I've ever purchased.
1,It's still Miles Davis,"This is Miles, late in his career. More band leader and mentor, still experimenting musically and sartorially, spending evermore time with his back to his audience, sound is OK. If you are a completist, this is worth consideration, but I find his earlier performances much worthier of consideration, they are uniformly brilliant and consistent and worth returning to again and again."
3,Hit&Miss,"this Set is very Hit&Miss while Michael Jackson's ""Human Nature"" gets a Strong Make over here as does Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" the majority of this set suffers from a cold 80's Sound that Effected many Acts even One Miles Davis.Very Spotty in Spots a few Bright Moments here&there."
3,"Old, outdated, but with a certain usefulness","This is an old, bi-lingual edition of Hebrew poems. Many of the poets anthologized here are no longer relevant, but the main poets of the cannon are included, with some slips that are understandable. For example Yehuda Amichai, perhaps the greatest Hebrew poet of the late 20th century, has but a few poems here. But they are refreshing. Hebrew poems did not have a vernacular quality until at last Amichai. The early poems in this collection are full of old words and outdated usages which make for difficult, even funny reading. Yet the collection shows how the Israeli vernacular caught up and surpassed literary Hebrew, taking what it wanted and discarding what it did not, and in the process creating a robust poetic diction."
3,Could be a little more durable,"Great and fast little device when it works.Unfortunately the size means you'll try to put it in places where its maximum lifespan will be drastically reduced, such as in a wallet or on a keychain. Mine just died after a few months use. Just an FYI.Unfortunately a wallet is a perfect place for this thing, but the environment in there for an active guy such as myself must be too unforgiving ;)"
1,it's wonderful until it breaks,"I was quite excited about this product, and it worked great for about 5 months. Then I noticed it began to rattle slightly and occasionally it wouldn't be recognized by the computer. One day it stopped working all together. Thankfully I had a recent backup of my data. I will say that OCZ does a great job with warranty service and they promptly shipped me out a new one, but it had the same problem 3 months later...the rattle...then it stopped working. I am on my 3rd drive--A quick search through OCZ's support forums reveals that this is a common problem for people with this drive (I suspect OCZ knows this is a problem and that is why they were so willing to replace it)."
4,Laughing at yourself is the best laughter,"Garrison Keillor has the most endearing ability to make us look at ourselves and not be too ashamed. It's ok, most of us are mediocre. We cannot help it, relax. But we must never take ourselves too serious either. Aside from the great study of human folly, this book must contain the funniest description of writer's block. I got LOVE ME from the library and ended up copying all the pages on which ""Larry Wyler"" converses with his boss William Shawn,the real editor of New Yorker magazine. Readers, if you want to become writers, too, then read this book for all its wistful insight about trying to write well. ENJOY!"
3,Vintage Keillor,"If you've listened to ""Prairie Home Companion,"" then you probably do not need to read this book. The same somewhat scattered approach is used here to tell a slightly humorous but often patience-trying story. There are simply too many writerly indulgences on view here. Never mind the autobiographical overlay; the characters are just not sympathetic and (excuse me for saying it) the author needs to focus more on the reader's needs than his own. Okay for a Keillor fan."
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed Garrison Keillor's ""Lake Woebegone Days,"" but his penchant for spewing his political opinions in otherwise non-political pieces has made me chary of his more recent work. (I notice he has a book about being a born Democrat, ""from the heart:"" I haven't chosen to read it. While he certainly isn't using his head, I don't know if he really speaks from the heart. Maybe more from the spleen.) I suppose Mr. Keillor is still successful enough that he does not mind alienating a large portion of his soon-to-be-outta-here audience.The narrator of ""Love Me"" does not account for most of the time that passes between college and old age, a bit of sloppiness. There were some flashes of insight and amusing writing, but it could have been condensed into a short story. Not a satisfying story. Probably a true story for Keillor, in some ways. What a drag."
3,Too many influences,"Still trying to find his way through a variety of influences, Harding creates another likeable but ultimately forgettable collection of tunes. Elvis Costello's sound is here on songs like ""The Movie of your Life"" and ""Long Dead Gone,"" (Pete Thomas of The Attractions is even the drummer.) ""Save a Little Room for Me"" has more than a touch of Van Morrison, and even Springsteen and Dylan seem to be present in spirit if not reality. The only problem is Harding gets lost in the mix. Every time I listen to Harding, I keep thinking there is an artist here who is trying to break free from his influences, as excellent as they are, but I never seem to get to the essence of what Harding is capable of."
3,good shoes but the size is smaller than usual,it is a pair of comfortable shoe. But Vaneli seems has smaller size. I tried other shoes with this brand in DSW and found all of them almost half size smaller than other shoes.
4,excellent read,I read this book shortly after it's release in the 80's. I got the book from the Boston Public Library. Recently I've been reading other books on artforgeries and recalled the talent of this gentleman and how he fooled so many so called experts. His altarpiece that was sold to the Boston Museumof Fine Arts was such an embarrassment to the museum it was kept hidden from view.
4,monkey magic,Winogrand has a good sense of humour and his time spent in the zoo with his kids was put to good use. Much more interesting than the airports book but for me Figments from the Real World rocks harder...It's not expensive so worth putting in the collection!
2,Timex needs to take their name off this product,"I was pretty impressed considering it was fairly cheap and had the Timex name on it. Unfortunately, it's actually made by a subcontractor, Maverick Housewares. The features promised are a 12 hour forecast, sunrise/set times, moon phase, tides, barometric pressure for 12 hours, indoor & outdoor temp & humidity, as well as an atomic clock. The only accurate components in that list is the indoor temperature and the atomic clock. The barometer & outdoor temp & humidity are just WRONG, as well as the sunset/rise times, and moon phase. Because the barometer is wrong (by about an inch,) the forecast is useless, b/c the forecast is based off of the inaccurate barometric pressure , so it just predicts thunderstorms and rain on a nice sunny day. In a nutshell, steer elsewhere."
5,AUTHENTIC CUISINE EXPRESSED WITH ART,"Lebanese cuisine is known to be the best food on earth, healthy with lots of flavors and aromas. It is rare to find a book which has authentic recipes. Rayess is an amazing chef with good taste, his recipes are exactly what expected when executed in any kitchen, the results are always delightful.This book is explanatory and simple to follow."
1,"Difficult to use, gave book away","I bought this cookbook because the writer's name is the same as my grandfather's. I am an experienced chef who prepares Lebanese food several times a week at home but found this cookbook to be difficult to use. The index was poorly done and the recipes were unclear. There was a sense of snugness in the writing that indicated that the reader had to do it ""his way"" or not do it at all. I gave the book away."
2,find the delta base...............,"I have this same base for my Jet jtas 10 cabinet saw, and agree with other reviewers, it could be much better. My son just bout a Delta cabinet saw, and after findining the right delta base for the the size it is a Much better base, especially if like the rest of us u want to build in cabinets, because it has a double rail fram thru out not just a single rail in the middle............."
2,batting gloves,"El producto no es de mala calidad pero lamentablemente no llego lo que compre.En dias pasados (03/08/2010)realice una compra de 2 (dos) guantines (Batting Gloves) de Softbol tamano(size) Large, sin embargo recibi uno tamaño Youth Large y Youth MediumSaludos,"
2,Disappointing...,"I recently had the opportunity to examine this book in depth, and I admit this book was rather disappointing. This book only DEFINES phrases such as: ""Absence makes the heart grow fonder,"" but NEVER explains the ORIGINS of each phrase. Since most everyone knows the definition of phrases such as ""Just what the doctor ordered"" defining it is seems almost pointless. Want to look up a cliche about being sick(for instance)? Think again, each 'cliche' is listed ONLY alphabetically and can not easily cross-referenced by subject matter giving it ZERO practical application to the modern writer or researcher.For those seeking deeper understanding of cliches, you'd best look elsewhere. This was a superficial effort at best."
2,Wanna-be,"If you just want a soothing female vocalist cd, then this is ok. If you want mathematically corrupt western 12-tone equi-temperment sounding pseudo-mantra-muzak, this is the CD for you. If you think mantra is about harmony and not melody, buy this! If you want the real deal, look elsewhere."
1,...,"This has nothing to do with Kundalini yoga. This album reeks of cheese and exploitation of true chant. Do not buy this album if you have any taste...it is titled, ""Manta Girl!"" They are trying way to hard to be ""cool,"" and fail with tremendous misery. Look at Nirvana Lounge by ""Claude Challe"" who does the""Buddha Bar"" arrangements, he gives chant music modern flare. I have one thing to say to Erin, DO NOT QUIT YOUR DAY JOB!!!!!"
1,waste of time and money,"I've been rabidly collecting mantra music for some time and was hopeful this album would satiate my appetite, but after a few listens, I've concluded this album sucks. Ths music is bland, her vocals don't touch a nerve, and the whole project generally lacks shakti. Beware of buying (overpriced) music from Amazon that doesn't allow you to preview any tracks! Not only that, but the artwork is wrong. She's inverted some of the chakra symbols, duh! Don't waste your money on this... go and buy Deva Premal, an artist with real talent and integrity.namaste :)"
3,"Great beats, if you like techno yoga","This is a fantastic CD, but way too dance beat for yoga. However, for a hip, dancable yoga CD this is the one. Move over Madonna, Mantra Girl is the real thing and so is the yoga teacher-singer Erin (aka Mantra Girl's vocalist). Instead of pretending to be newagey and soothing, Erin goes all the way into the electronic realm of her dancing roots without apology for her nudity on the cover (which is sure to make traditional yogi's squirm). Yes, the music is highly synthesized, but it's well done unlike Rasa and Deva Premal who typically overdo the reverb on their voice. Go Erin!!! Go Mantra Girl!!"
5,"More Difficult to Solve, worth the money","A considerable fan of Agatha Christie and David Suchet, I somehow had never heard of any of these mysteries, but none disappoint. I thought the plots more complicated in this set, compared to some of the others, making the films more worth purchasing and viewing."
3,Love the series,"But.........disappointed with the Blue ray. Any large dark areas suffer from intense 'busy-ness' almost like static. Much worse than other blue ray or dvd that I have seen. I have to look up ans see what is the cause.Content is superb, in fact overall the picture quality is excellent."
5,Continues to be the Best!,"One can never be disappointed in any Agatha Christie whodunit, and David Suchet's portrayal of Hercule Poirot is always a treat, this recent release is no exception. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy; over and over again."
5,New Poirot Movies,"How wonderful to have new Poirot movies. It's David Suchet so you know they will be good and that you'll enjoy them. Sunday afternoon with Poirot, how perfect. I've now seen them all now and you need to get them, you like them. They arrived in excellent condition within the specified time."
5,Extremely fine,"The dvd on Poirot was in ecellant condition. I have watched two of the episodes and as always, Poirot is the ultimate sleuth. I am a great fan of the English mystery and will definitely order other in the series from Amazon."
4,Poirot Movies,"Always an excellent gift. Arrived on time, packaged appropriately and met all our viewing needs. I look forward to future email suggestions."
4,very helpful,"If you are able to learn by memorization, then these vocabulary cards will be very helpful. I've used a few different books to learn Portuguese on my own, and one thing I've missed is vocabulary. I could put together a sentence, but only with the 20 or so words that my lesson books used over and over! So these cards were great as a supplement to my basic grammar lessons. They're a little dry, but effective all the same."
1,Terrible Piece of Plastic Garbage,"Our subdivision used these in all the brick mailboxes. Probably because they were the cheapest piece of garbage they could find. They are that... garbage.Two problems:1. The door falls off of the front because it is only held in by what I call ""small nipples"". The mailman just breaks the door off eventually. He probably has enough to wallpaper a room with them.2. There are holes in the bottom of the mailbox. This allows wasps to live in the brick mailbox."
2,A light and easily read book but lacking in hard techniques,"A good book to inform the complete novice but lacks real techniques and depth. A bit of a springboard for Mr McKennas company and his many hypnotic products. As a much better choice I can recommend ""Professional Stage Hypnosis"" by Ormond McGill. This covers a range of techniques and is much more technical in nature, it actually teaches you how to hypnotise and lists stage routines."
3,Okay but......,"S'Okay but Jonathan Chase's 'Deeper and Deeper' stage hypnosis book available from amazon.co.uk only or his web site, tells you how in a way this book simply doesn't.Bill"
3,An okay book about hypnosis but lack in methods.,"This book was written by the DJ come stage hypnotist come NLPer Paul McKenna. It seems to be a collection of ideas of hypnosis and NLP and stage hypnosis, but it lacks a bit in concrete methods. It reads as more of a personal treatise than an actual 'how to' book."
5,"Rating: ""A-"" -- gorgeous color photos of the red-rock countr",mailed 6/2/99 -- your website not compatible with LYNX
3,Too much going on,The book was not told very well. The background story was a great idea. However the manner in which it was told was very confusing. I was unable to complete the book. The story keep jumping from one character to the next. It was not a smooth transition. Too much was going on to keep the characters straight.
5,Page turner!!,"I truly enjoyed this book. I found that it took me through so many emotions and reminded me of those terrible chances I took which were in fact truly choices I made in life during my 20's and early 30's. I actually found that I developed a relationship with the characters. I often wanted them to do the things I wanted them to do and at the moment when I thought they would do what I predicted for them they flipped the script on me. So I found myself getting angry, happy, disappointed my emotions ran the whole gamut. The author also was able to write in such away that the reader could create a vivid picture of all the characters and scenes in the book. For me that was the best part about it. It appears that the author has a way with creating a picturesque scene in written form. I definitely recommend it for some good fun entertainment."
5,Entangled In the Web of By chance or Choice,"Wow I don't know where to begin. I actually thought this was going to take me a while to read because of the number of pages. Unknowingly to me I was reading every available opportunity extending, lunches, breaks and cooking fast food dinners. Liteally reading until I fell asleep. By chance or Choice is a story of a group of friends that will entangle you in their web of life as you read. Once your entangled in the web you can't out until your reach the end.Everything about this story you can best believe is By Chance Or Choice. Way to go Toni can't wait for next one."
3,'Just Us Girls' Book Review,"The ladies of 'Just Us Girls' Book Club reviewed this book in December '03. As a New Jersey based book club, we closely related with this New Jersey native author who used many references to NY/NJ spots & locations. The group did feel that the author had too many characters to keep up with which led to too many story lines to follow. And it did take the author a long time to get to the message."
5,A Must Read!!!!!!!!!,"Excellent Book,Toni Staton Harris captures the essence of todays black woman and her trials and tribulations through everyday life and love. There is a little bit of each and everyone of us in her colorful characters, I saw myself many times. Once you get started reading you can't put it down, each chapter begs you to go further and further. I finished this book in three days, and it leaves you wanting more. Toni please!!!! we need a part two.........SOON."
3,Hmmm....,"Yeah I've heard about those banned episodes.""Electric Soldier Porygon"" was banned because Pikachu thunderbolted missiles heading towards Porygon causing several hundred blue and red flashes in 5 seconds. This resulted in 12000 cases of epileptic fits(seizures) in Japanese children and adults! The show was put on 4 months hiatus and was almost banned by Nintendo.""The Ice Cave"" was banned because Team Rocket deliberately gave Brock the Flu or Hypothermia which ringed some of the symptoms of the SARS going around at the time of the airing of this episode.""Beauty and The Beach"" was banned because of Team Rocket giving James cleavage/boobs to win a beauty contest.""The Legend Of Dratini"" was banned because of the use of projectile weapons(guns).Guns have been used in other episodes as well but none of them towards firing at other people as shown in this episode.Anyway it's a good buy."
2,Make it stop once and for all....please.....,"Ow, not only have I heard that Gotta catch em all trash a zillion times and then grew tired of it, I'm sick of these chumps themselves. Except, that is, for Pikachu, Mew, and Lugia."
2,This may be what you're looking for,These stamps are the same size at the pattern blocks in the Saxon curriculum. Mine arrived with the triangle broken. I never opened the package and tried to use them. The company wasn't super easy to work with since I didn't want them to just send me a new triangle. I simply wanted to return the item because I ended up buying something else instead as I needed them by a specific date.
3,The Art of Gerry Mulligan,The very best jazz recording in my collection.Should have been voted the best jazz recording of the year.Very disappointing Gerry died prematurely.
4,Seeds of Change - the early years of reclaiming biodiversity,"This book was published in 1994, so I'd really like to see an update, as this book chronicles the motivation for founding Seeds of Change (the seed company) and the company's genesis. The company Seeds of Change has been purchased by M&M;/Mars, so although their catalog remains similar, I wonder if they are still holding true to their ideals.This book has good information on the importance of preserving/reclaiming biodiversity through heirloom and open pollinated crops. We have lost diversity in our diets, and we are paying the price with our health. Chemical monoculture negatively affects the food value of our crops, and Seeds of Change was one of the first commercial enterprises to sound the call of alarm in the US."
3,good basic overview of possible advances,This book seems to be written with the curious in mind. It's a good introduction into the field. the only complaint I have about this book is the lack of a bibliography.
3,Not Sharon's best,"Some parts of the book are so thrilling that you can't read fast enough to get to the next page. Some parts are really boring that you'll wonder if you'd like to keep reading the book or just throw it away. The book's end is not so bad but SS can do it better. So, to finish my review I'll recommend you read this book in a cruise or at the beach. That way when you get to the boring parts you'll enjoy your holidays."
5,"A passionate, powerful novel","REUNION is author Sharon Sala's newest novel, and in my opinion, one of her finest. A unique mixture of suspense and mystery, with a generous helping of love added for flavor, this intriguing novel will keep the reader on the edge of her seat! I personally was up reading until the wee hours of the morning, anxious to find out exactly what happens to the wonderful main characters, Gabriel and Laura. Sharon Sala has a wonderful gift for presenting compelling, true-to-the-times subjects that grab the imagination of her readers and hold on to the very last word.(Plus, she is a really nice lady too!) Reminiscent of Sala's bestselling SWEET BABY, her newest offering REUNION is a passionate, powerful book. I highly recommend it!Sharon Galligar Chance"
3,This story was very predictable.,"I was very disappointed in this book. The outcome was predictable, and the story line was choppy."
3,Hmmmm....,"Well, I DID enjoy this book - in a sort of squirmy, self-conscious way. You couldn't read this with a straight face. It teeters on the edge of being really sickeningly sentimental, and only manages to veer away at the last moment with the odd dash of wry humour. This is not an intellectual romance which can be enjoyed with the brain switched on. Sorry everyone, but let's face it, Ms Sala can be a bit twee. She does write very well - her style is terribly readable, but her characters are so very virtuous, loving and nice that it's hard to truly LIKE them. Oh, well, I suppose nothing's perfect - except for the hero and heroine in this book of course."
3,Not her best,"This is my third Sharon Sala book and is my least fovorite. I didn't connect with her main character, Gabriel, until near the end of the book. I know that he was experiencing the major loss of his parents and was trying to adjust to his dreams of murders, but he seemed like a ""whiny"" guy to me. I did figure out who the murderer was half way through the book. Several of the secondary characters added to the story."
5,Reunion,"I first read this book several years ago when a friend lent it to me. Loved it then. Couldn't find a copy of it, but it got me started on Sharon Sala/Dinah McCall. I love to read and read everything published by certain authors...Sharon Sala is definitely one of those. This book covers all the emotions. I still cry my eyes out at the end when the brothers finally reunite."
3,Nice activities but confusing and a bit hard....,"As a teacher I know there are a lot of programs for kids that aren't very helpful. I think this series has good ideas and my 3 year old enjoys playing but I find the replay unbearable. I think some of the activities are too hard for the average 3-4 year old. My son enjoys the graphics like the train, but he has no idea about some of the activities. I think this will be more helpful to him in a year or so. I cannot believe the age range of 2-4. If you can get this discounted,... do it. Otherwise, don't pay much more. Also the other cd, with the travel agency, seems to glitch up. It is really not necessary. Get the basic version. Deluxe it is not!"
2,Not an Improvement,"This Deluxe version is not an improvement of the original. The Travel agency feature is too difficult for a 2-4 year old and any way it is constantly locking up and causing the computer to crash! If you can get the original version, do it. The company should recall this product."
5,Best young kids' software I have found,"My 4 year old starting playing this when he was 2 1/2 and still plays it. It is easy to understand and has areas that even the youngest beginners can understand, and as the game get more difficult it is great for older players as well. It has consistent instructions and buttons, so he could play independently without constantly calling me over to help him as he does with other software. It has grown with him and now his 2 1/2 year old brother is starting to play it and loves it. I recommend this package to any parent who is looking to start their child on computer software. In fact, I am writing this review because I am in the process of buying Jumpstart Preschool for my niece who is about to turn two."
1,do not get this software!,"I got this CD for my daughter when she turned 2 1/2. Now she is three and still frustrated! The instructions are hard to understand, most of the time the characters just stand there, expecting the child to guess what needs to be done next. The games are boring and discouraging. Don't waste your money!"
3,Turning chuck,I don't like chucks that close with the steel inserts. Too easy to lose. A fair product but not great.
1,jez,This is garbage. I know you get what you pay for but Grizzly has not let me down in the past. It came unbalanced. What a disappointment.
1,"NOT plug and play, pick the MITO","July 2006. After testing the Jwin, Griffen 30BK, Edge DiskGO, and the Kensington Pico, and the MITO, the MITO wins hands down. The JWIN is not plug and play and presented quite a bit of static, the Griffin could not muster the volume, as was the case with the Kensington, and the Edge was just a P.O.S., with no stereo transmission, and a battery door that would not close. My test was specifically for transmission to a Panasonic Boom box, used while on vacation. In both N.J. and N.C., the MITO performed well, with little static, and plenty of volume for those late night jam sessions after the kids and wives were asleep. Go with the MITO, you won't be sorry."
5,Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons,"If your child is struggling with learning to read, this book is the answer for you! I HIGHLY recommend it to any parent who's watching with a crying heart, while their child falls behind in reading.It's not hard to do, but takes a daily lesson... we started with only 10 minutes a day, then moved it up to 15-20 minutes a day. Nothing is more satisfiying than seeing a previous stuttering-hesitant-guess-the-word reader who dreads ""trying"" to read, become a capable reader!"
4,Ready to read?,"We just purchased this book, not knowing if our 4 1/2 year old was ready for this, we decided to try it out for the summer. We do not have a 4 year old who likes to sit for long periods. She is able to tolerate the short lessons, and I was amazed when she read the word ""am"" after only four lessons. We however, are not able to do the writing lessons. Our four year old does not have the fine motor needed for the difficult tasks of writing lower case a and s. We spent a lot of time on the writing lessons, with little success. We will continue our summer quest for reading, and leave the writing for later. I do love the parent scripted instruction, and think it works well with our child."
2,Far less than adequate,"I have tried several books and software to teach my children. This book was my least favorite. The idea is good but that is all. Nearly everything in it is poorly done. The text does not need to be so distorted. The lessons are painful in their insistence on doing it according to the script. I would like to meet the person who can get the child through the instructional drivel. The stories are cute but always too long. This is a book with major flaws and is not for younger kids. If you have a child who is less than enthusiastic to learn to read, he will hate this overly regimented, artificial approach. I discovered another book - The Reading Lesson, used and liked it very much. Similar approach but what a difference!"
2,"ok book, but hopefully you can find better","This book did help my son learn to read somewhat, but he was by no means a ""reader"" when we were done with it, and we had to supplement with other things to get him really reading. The system taught is so specific to the DISTAR program that you can't really quit in the middle if it isn't working for you. ALso, the lessons are dreadfully boring, and were painful to get through, for both my son and for me. We had to promse a trip to 6 flags to him to motivate him to finish it! Might work for some, but didn't do much for us."
2,Easy? Not really!,"I got this book to help my 5 year old learn to read.I think the concept is good, but he really didn't respond well to the drilling each day. He lost interest really fast. I think, as a previous educator, it may be an okay outline to use, but must be used in conjunction with other resources that grab the child's attention. Understanding that a word is made up of several sounds and learning to blend them is a necessary skill, but repetitious drill alone just didn't work for us."
5,Reading Success,"Great tool to teach reading. I used it will all 3 of my boys - one of which was reading at a 2nd grade level at 5 years old.If your child can play rhyming games with you (like you say ""cat"" and she says ""hat""), then he/she is probably ready for this book. I highly recommend it!"
5,"It works, and my child loves it!","My daughter has been able to read since she was a young 3 because of this series. Now we are using it with my 2-year-old, and she's beginning to read. Awesome tool! I never pushed this on my kids - my older would go and get the book and ask to be taught after the first lesson. Sometimes, we did 1/2 a lesson at a time and finished the rest later. Before she turned four, she could read, write all her letters (with some oddities, of course) and spell words. Fantastic."
3,Not very kid friendly,"I was very excited to start teaching my daughter to read. The book, however, isn't visually attractive so it is hard to grab and hold a child's attention. So far I have had very little luck with this book."
2,Kids didn't enjoy this one,"My kids did not enjoy this book, I'm sorry to say. I liked it because of the scripts, and I'm sure for some, it may work well. But my kids found the lessons to be too long and boring. Went back to my Bob Books and to Phonics Pathways by Delores Hiskes. They seem to enjoy these much more -perhaps because both books have some creative art work - maybe my kids are more visual than most?"
3,Specifically for parents using Jolly Phonics...,"I am writing this review specifically for parents who are already using Jolly Phonics (which I highly recommend...with a few reservations though). I had hoped that Teach Your Child To Read would be a good complement to Jolly Phonics since Jolly Phonics does not come with much instructional text for the parent/teacher. Teach Your Child To Read... is well written and full of good information. Furthermore, there are no real conflicts with teaching techniques between the two, but I just found nothing in this book to add to what we are already doing with Jolly Phonics.It seems to me that Teach Your Child To Read is a good one-stop shop for those parents who may or may not have a lot of experience in teaching a child to read. It is quite scripted for the parent/teacher. It is not as good for the parent looking for some creative supplementary material."
4,Great Help,My son was diagnosed with a learning disorder and we found this book a great help. We use it along with his regular school work as a supplement.
3,Good but...,"This program is excellent for teaching how to read, but I was surprised with all of the typos-missed signs, use of different letters, silent letters that were small on one page but not the next and how often they introduced words or sounds without teaching them first. It also gets difficult with too many changes, it became frustrating for us both. At lesson 76, we needed to stop and review the lessons for several weeks before we were able to finish. We finished the program and it works, but they need to edit it again, do the program with a child and he will show you all the mistakes. A helpful hint we made a sticker board and after each completed lesson he got a sticker and then we counted them together which helped him to learn to count to a 100. I recommend this program, but be prepared for the poor editing."
3,Different cover,"I've heard great things about this book so I checked a copy out from the library so we could try it before buying it. It was great so I ordered it here on Amazon. Shipping was fast and the price was good. The copy we received is from a different publisher and has a different cover. The content appears to be the same so I'm sure it will be fine, I just think the picture of the product on Amazon should match what you are actually buying."
5,Awesome,"This book was everything I hoped for and more. My 5 year old, who isn't in Kindergarten yet, is so excited that he is learning to read. He loves it!"
1,Ridiculous,This book is ridiculous! It's not worth your time or money! If you notice the author is completely against all public school teachers saying they use only the whole language approach. It is pretty bold to claim to know how each of the millions of public school teachers teach reading in the classroom. Clearly the author doesn't have a clue.
5,"If you think your child can't read, buy this book","This book is simply incredible. We used it to teach our two daughters to read when each was at the age of 5, and this was no small task. I would especially recommend it to you if your child has been labeled as ""dyslexic"" or if you have been given other medical-sounding reasons why your child cannot read. The book is a systematic, logical sequence of lessons that allow almost any child to succeed time after time. And when you're done with the book, your child is reading!"
3,ehhhhh,"Well this book came highly recommended for my daughter who was struggling to read. (she is 3) When I got it, it is the exact thing that our kindergarten homeschool curriculum is doing and was not much additional help. Granted I was not pushing her to do the schooling or anything due to her age and was keeping it fun for her. We took 2 weeks off of ""school"" and voila she is a reader now. So technically this book did not help too much just needed to give her a bit more time to figure it out on her own."
5,It works!,"This book works! We just finished lesson 33 and whenever we finish a lesson, my 5-year-old asks to do another one. I'm excited to see where we'll be in another month. Thanks!"
3,Could be better,"It is an interesting concept and it probably works. However, the book would benefit greatly from color illustrations and more engaging stories. My child is showing good results, however, he is extremely bored with this book (we are on lesson 65)."
5,Wonderful Book!,"This book is amazing! I taught my children to read... they are now 8 and 6. They were reading by the time they were 5!! Take your time, repeat lessons if you have to. This book works!!"
5,Makes teaching my kids to read a simple job,"The book is very well made. Prior to using this book, I had no guidance or direction in teaching my kids to read. This book does a great job at giving every detail needed to effectively navigate the child through each lesson. I highly recommend it."
5,Amazing progress,"Only on Lesson 18 but the progress is amazing and rewarding. Getting the sound pronunication is a little strange and at first you may think ' this is not going to work' but stick with it, it does work. Great book."
5,My 4 year old can read!,"Our town's pre-school budget was cut, and she won't be able to attend school this year, so I thought I'd better do something to keep her busy. I purchased this book after reading the reviews, and after just a few lessons my daughter was able to read a few words. Now we are on lesson 23 and she is reading very well. I absolutely love this book. Before purchasing this, I was completely ignorant about what approach to take to teach a child to read, and this book meets all my expectations.The only problem I see is the some portions of the lessons are very slow and boring, so we do end up skipping some parts of it. I can only keep my daughter's attention for maybe 10 minutes, so we usually don't complete an entire lesson in a day. Having said that, I have no regrets at all about purchasing this. It has helped me achieve the goal I wanted, without forking out alot of money."
5,20 minutes a day for immeasurable rewards,"I am teaching my 5 1/2 year old daughter to read with this book. We are on lesson 23 and I am very pleased with the results, she is reading some simple sentences. We make it an uncompromising part of our daily routine. It does involve some work from the child, but it's a good lesson on how rewarding work and effort can be...besides, it's only 15-20 minutes long. That's about all my wiggly daughter can handle anyway. Now, she reminds me it's time for reading lessons. She gets to feel good about mastering a big skill, I get to feel good about being the one who teaches her to read. The scripting makes it easy for me and direct and clear for the child. The time we spend on this daily is a treasure beyond value."
5,"The best ""how to"" book I ever bought","I used this book to teach my daughter how to read, just before she started kindergarten. When my son was about to start kindergarten, I was too busy, so my daughter, now age 10, used the book to teach him. A great investment for all parents."
2,Disappointed,"If there were no other reading programs available, the 100 lessons would be OK. Alas, it is too cumbersome, too clumsy. With all the advances in publishing and software technology this primitive and tedious book should be retired. After buying the 100 lessons and trying to use it, I went back to see parents' reviews. It's hard to believe that any parent can finish the book. Someone on the web suggested the Reading Lesson with CD-rom and I bought it. My son and I like it a lot better."
3,"Great for some, not for others","I purchased this book to teach my 3 yr. old son to read based on the recommendations of several friends who had great success with it. Children do read words successfully very early in this book, and that is enough motivation for some to finish the program. My son was proud of himself during the first 10 lessons or so, but his enthusiasm dwindled by the sheer repetition and lack of hands on learning. While I do believe we place too much emphasis on entertaining children in education, there was nothing fun or even interesting in these lessons that made him want to come back for more. He was also troubled by the heavy use of phonetic symbols and creative spellings - they just didn't look like the words he normally sees in books. After 25 lessons, we switched to a different method that is just as good (or better) and that he actually enjoys. To each his own."
4,"On lesson 25, so far, so good","My son is just 4 and he is tearing through this book. He wants to do more than one lesson a day (they don't take us 20 minutes at all), but I am holding back so he stays excited. I like that the parent text is in pink, so I can easily find what I am supposed to say. The sound of the letters can be confusing (we just reached ""o"") so I have to peek ahead to see what sound the letter is making in the words they use. I think it's just that they use symbols above the letters that aren't commonly used in phonics books (it is specific for this method).My son is gaining confidence and he likes that he is already reading words for each lesson. If it goes well, I will use this method for my third child! (My oldest was completely self-taught at age 3.5.)"
5,"Amazing, Amazing BOOK!!!!","My 5 year old is reading!!! He's actually reading, and with the help of this book, we are doing an amazing job!!! He looks forward to it everyday!!! He can't wait to read the new stories and new sounds.I am so grateful for this book.. I will be using it with my other 2!!!Sure it might be longer than 20 minutes, but why would you NOT want to spend that time with your child and listening to her/him read. It's worth it!!!"
2,Depends on your kid -- not for mine,"The Bob Books have been a way more fun and successful path to early reading for my daughter. I suppose this book would work if your goal were to teach a kid methodically how to read. Therefore it might be good for kids who are having trouble learning to read in school. However, if your kid is in kindergarten or younger, there's no need to rush them. Books with real words, such as Bob Books (and of course there are others, but those are the ones we're using), are so much more fun for my daughter, and I suspect for most kids. At an early age, fun seems more important than drills like this book."
2,Not for the reluctant learner,"I bought this book after reading the glowing recommendations. The process used is indeed thorough, but BORING! My child is ADD and a kinesthetic learner. She was bored, literally to tears (so was I!). I could not get her past lesson six. For me, it was a waste of money. If your child needs auditory and/or visual stimulation to encourage him or her, this is not the book for you. Also, it introduces an alternative spelling method that ultimately must be unlearned. This was too much for my already reluctant and frustrated six-year-old."
5,Miracle Worker,"Over two years ago ""Maria"" was stricken with bacterial meningitis. A college scholar, musician, and artist could no longer read or write. After having worked with her for five or six months just trying hit and miss methods, I purchased ""Teach Your Child To Read In 100 Easy Lessons.""It was clear, simple to use, and easily adaptable to my particular need. Maria now reads at the fourth or fifth grade level, still struggling with the aftermath of her disease, but she is confident and happy that she can read again. I could never have done it without this book. It is a miracle worker! Thank you, thank you, thank you."
5,I have a love/hate relationship with this book,"I highly recommend this book. As painfully boring as these reading lessons were, they were truly worth it. My son's reading skills are remarkable. We tried to make the experience a little more fun with a sticker/reward chart for each lesson. (And I bribed him with candy.) It was about as fun for me as a 100 trips to the DMV, and he didn't always want to sit and do his lessons. Eventually, though, he got so excited about being able read on his own that he would remind me it was time for his lesson. I am bracing myself for my younger son's turn. He just turned three, and I know he's ready. I've been the one delaying his start because, my goodness, this book is boring."
5,This is great!,"I first used the Your Baby Can Read Program but soon realized it didn't teach phonics. My kids were guessing at the words and not actually ""reading"" them. So my friend told me about this book. She used it on her son and now at age 5 he has a 3rd grade reading level. I was impressed so I got it and am now on lesson 10 with my 4 year old. She enjoys the lessons. They are just right. Not to long and not too short. The book has a great introduction to help the parent understand exactly what to do and the methods this book uses. I completely agree with it and am so glad I found out about this book. By lesson 10 my daughter is already able to sound out and read two and three letter words. I really think this would be great for any child. If the lessons start out too easy you can always do two a day. I highly recommend this book. Why spend hundreds of dollars on all the fancy reading programs when this works great for just a few dollars!"
5,A great way to build your childs self-confidence,"I started using this book when my son was four years old. It was very simple to follow for me and my son. We started by doing one lesson a day, but then my son loved it so much that we began to do a couple of lessons everyday, during the summer. He is now the youngest in his first grade class and reading at a third grade+ reading level. It has boosted his confidence to the point that he believes he can learn anything. He now has a true passion for reading and it has a lot to do with this book."
5,the perfect learn to read book,"This has been the perfect book for helping my 6 year old son learn to read. He had no interest in any other lessons or practice but this book has made the difference. He is excited to sit down and work on the lessons, he remembers what he learned and about a third of the way through the book he is trying to sound out and read words on his own.Very pleased with this book!"
5,Great book,This book worked very well for my 4-year-old daughter. She came to me and wanted to learn to read so I did some searching and found this book on Amazon for a great price and thought I would give it a shot. This book taught her to sound out words very well and she enjoyed doing the lessons. Now that she has started kindergarten I couldn't be more happy that I used this book with her and gave her a little headstart.
5,Wonderful book,"I taught my son to read with this book when he was 3 years old. We sat down and did the lessons 4 nights a week and after 100 lessons, he could read just about any word that was put in front of him.I am by no means a brilliant teacher, I just did what the book said and when it was over, he could read. Not sure how successful other books, cds or computer programs are at teaching a 3 year old how to read, but this book works."
2,"A good reading program, but not a phonics curriculum","I used this book to teach my 4-year old to read. It ""works"" but it teaches a blend of phonics and whole language techniques. This left my daughter doing a lot of guessing rather than reading. I noticed that she could ""read"" during the lessons, but to see the same words out of context, she did not know how to sound out the words properly. I have had to find another curriculum that is purely phonics and back track a bit to ensure that she knows how to read well. I will choose another reading curriculum such as ""Explode the Code"" or ""Sing, Spell, Read, and Write"" to teach my other two children how to read."
4,Does the job,This book is very helpful. We are utilizing it for our second child and our first learned to read with this book. There are some things which I didn't care for but it does teach your child to read!
5,easy exercises make it easy to teach your child to read,"I have used this book with my oldest son who is now in first grade. His teacher has informed us that he is the strongest reader in his class, and that he is reading on a 2nd grade level. I am working with my 5 year old son now, who will be in kindergarten next year. It is amazing how this program works, he is reading and trying to sound out every word he sees. He does very well with each lesson. I am glad I discovered this book, I feel I gave my first son a good foundation for his reading skills. I cannot imagine how he would be reading if he was only taught through the school."
2,Too Scripted,"Teaching Your Child to read should move at their pace, on their time table, at their comfort and confidence level. I have been teaching young children for 7 years and there is no pre-scripted way to teach every child to read. It's like Potty Training. We all look for some ""magic technique"", but every child is different. Some will pick it up quickly and some will need more help and encouragement. The only thing I like is the idea of setting aside time every day to work on reading, no matter what. But what you work on that day should be based on your child's needs and attention span, not what the book tells you. Listen to your child, not this book."
2,Didn't work for my son,"My son is going through kindergarden again. The main reason, he can't read. I thought this book would help. He was easily bored with it. After the first two days with it, he wants nothing to do with it. It is sooo slow to begin. I thought if I skipped through some of the begininng it would not be so boring to him. I was wrong. We are now going to try BOB books. (Which he wanted to try in the first place.)"
2,Teach your child to read in 100 easy lessons,"The book is good, but it would be easier to use if there was a video tape or casette tape to go with it. I have a child who is almost 8 yrs. old, is in 1st grade. He doesn't decode letters or numbers at all. I believe the book would help him tremendously, but know that a video tape or cassette tape along with the book would benefit him greatly."
2,"Before you buy this book, read!","This is a good source to teach your child to read however, my nephew got board with it towards the middle of the book.He was a very fidigety 4 year old who didn't like to sit still! So we decited to buy BoB books(sold here), and Happy Phonics [...] Happy phonics is a curriculum that teaches reading through games. Listen to your child, and see what learning style suites them best.Kim L."
2,"the book is too wordy and ""busy""","I think the book is too wordy. The pages too confusing. I also cannot find a page where each orthographic sign is explained. I find forinstance no explanation for the sign under ""c"" on page 97 is explained."
3,Interesting methodology but...,"...overall too ponderous and unwieldly for teaching an average child to read...perhaps more to the point it's quite tedious and would probably be difficult to use given a typical child's attention span...however, for remedial work in adults I suspect it would be quite useful."
1,Boring,I tried reading it but it's too complicated. Flash cards work better. Just read with your child- can't go wrong.
3,Teach your child to read in 100 easy lessons,"We bought this to help our grandson read, but we didn't even use that book."
2,Not what I was expecting,"This book is not at all what I was expecting. As far as how well it works, I don't know. When I first got it and opened in up I was so disappointed that I put it up on the shelf and still have yet to use."
3,Basically OK,"Course not too difficult for my 5 yrs old son, however, too many written repetitions when I can just do it my own without the book telling to do."
5,solid foundation in reading and comprehension,My 5 year old son is on lesson 73 and reading well. I would recomend this book over any other reading program I have researched or experienced. He reads fluidly and comprehends all that he is reading. He can't sit still long enough for the slow paced phonics worksheets. He just wants the meat of reading then he's off to play in the dirt with his cars. It amazes me at how little repitition is required before a child understands. I think most other programs bore a child into hating reading. I'm very thankful we found this program!!!!!
5,This book has great potential!,My son is now 6 1/2 and is reading at a 5th grade reading level.This book helped him learn to read at age 3 1/2. I believe that the method used in this book provided him with the basis for his current powerful decoding skills in reading. Whether your child is just beginning to learn to read or struggling with reading because he/she is being taught to read using primarily sight reading skills-- this book can help assist in the process!!!!!!!!
4,"Working great, just added fun flash cards","I have a 3 1/2 year old that already knows his letter sounds. Since starting this book I have already noticed his confidence in reading becoming stronger! (lesson 36 now) I am very impressed.... However, I have taken the letter sounds and words and made flash cards for him to read from. This helps him focus and have fun with it. Next we will read the new words for the lesson and the interesting story. He loves the funny picture he gets to see after he successfully reads the story. I gave it a 4 because they should suggest fun flash cards to keep the younger ones interested. I Also made a chart from 1-100 that he gets to put a star on once complete."
5,"Works with Older Kids, Too!","I have worked with the direct instruction materials for many years (even when you had to hide the books in California !) For the past three years, I have used this book and the corrective programs to teach reading to high school age special education students. We have seen growth of 1.5 years to 5 years in one school year using the program. This is with students who have 'flat lined' on their tested reading scores for years. The students notice the difference in their ability to participate in their general education courses in a short time. If you are a special educator with similar students, get trained, follow the script and see what wonderful things happen!"
5,book,We used this book to teach our children to read and with great success. What a great book. I recommend it to all homeschoolers.
5,100 Easy Lessons,"Teach your child to read in 100 easy lessons is the book we used with our son, we were amazed he picked it up so quickly. We are currently using the book on our daughter that just turned four and she looks forward to the lessons. I will not lie that after the 50th lesson parents need to be more flexible, and allow more time with the child. This book does what it says it does. -Norma Wolf"
5,Awesome!,This is incredible. I never would have believed my child could learn to read in such a short amount of time spent each day and in such a short amount of lessons. We're not even on lesson 50 yet and he's reading! You HAVE to buy this book!
2,Too Confusing!,"I found this book confusing and my dd did too. I thought I would help my dd along in her reading with some phonics basics and I couldn't do it with this book. I think my dd is way too advanced for this book but may be fine with children who aren't reading yet. She knows all her basic letter sounds and is already reading simple books with little help, like 'Dick and Jane'. She just needs work on the harder phonics stuff. I am sure this book does 'the hard stuff' but I couldn't get past the first few pages to see if it did. This book just wasn't for us. :)"
1,Hard to use,"I had high hopes for this book. Since the title says ""Easy"" in it. It was not kid friendly or mom friendly. It was hard to use with the small, uninteresting print. The different symbols were confusing and my child was turned off to it right away and dreaded ""reading"" lessons to my Dismay. I have since purchased, ""Mommy, Teach me to Read"" and have had a ton more success!"
3,wrong book,I wanted the student book and this is just a teacher's edition so I was disappointed but know others who have used this and liked it
5,Great book!,"I used this to teach my kindergarten son to read fifteen years ago, so just bought this one for my granddaughter to learn. She's having a great time and is very excited for every lesson!"
3,Might be a good fit for you,"I purchased this book and then discovered it really wasn't a good fit for me. I liked the advice on helping a child being to learn to read but the system wasn't something that really worked for me. It was almost as if the child had to use a different alphabet. I know people have had great succes with this book and I think that's awesome but it was better for my teaching style to use my Happy Phonics by Diane Hopkins and just read, read, read with my little ones."
2,Too rigid for some kids,"I bought this book on reading the recommendations here, and I was very disappointed. My experience was similar to that of another reviewer in that the lessons became grueling and frustrating for both me and my son. I remain open-minded about the weird orthography, but the approach requires kids (mine is 4) to perform on command, turning what might be a fun time into a chore. I finally gave up after a particularly bad session in which we both became frustrated and angry. The method in this book repeatedly puts the child ""on the spot"" and for some children, like mine, the pressure is just too great.I'm sure this would be a fine method for some children, but I'm not sure how one would determine in advance how it would work for a particular child."
