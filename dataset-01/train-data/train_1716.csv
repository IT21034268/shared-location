2,Not Very Good,"First let me state that I am a fan of both JJ Cale and Leon Russell. That being said, there is little to like about this video.The sound quality is decent, but the video portion, while clear, is pathetic. Constant fade ins and outs from one shot to another are certain to give the viewer a headache after about 5 minutes. The camera is seldom on JJ, and while he is playing some great guitar solos the viewer is treated to a shot of Leon Russell sitting there looking stupid. Christine Lakewood looks like she took a couple of Quaaludes, and occupies far too much camera time.As if all that were not enough, JJ Cales hair looks like a Chia Pet, and one of the keyboard players is wearing shorts and roller skates.My advice is to turn off the picture of this DVD, and simply listen to the music."
5,GREAT DVD,"GREAT DVD with great songs and good 5.1 mix. If you like good and taste music, buy this dvd immediately!!!"
3,kind of cute,For the price of 9.99 I guess it is an ok buy but it does not seem so brilliant as shown in the picture. It is cute but is lost when I wear it..not for everyone I am afraid..
1,The (True?) Face of Jack the Ripper,"While the author seems overzealous in condemning the theories of others,he does little to support his own.In fact some of the evidence that he tries to discredit is more compelling than his own theories, which he presents as gospel."
1,Whatever,"Harris is infamous for championing two different suspects in different books, and neither argument holds water. Harris is very quick to debunk all theories but his own, even if other theories are more plausible (and coherent)."
2,Digitize this!,"This is a book for dummies! It assumes you know nothing about scanners, cameras or the digital world. If that's the case, then this is the book for you. However, I found it difficult to read as the author does not get to the point. Too much time is spent on the simplest things while ignoring the point of the text. It would have been nice to pick up a book like this and get to the point of 'how to' without having to jump hoops through the history of things. That was not the point of the purchase of such a book nor the representation of the cover. There was no point reading the entire text as I quickly realized that much of it was ""filler"" text and I could skip to the parts I thought were interesting. My recommendation would be to look for other title options before this one."
3,customer response,"I can't say honestly about the 3 books, as I haven't had time to research since I got them. The service, however was great. Do you have computer programs available as well. The one genealogy program I am thinking of is Legacy."
5,RIGHT OUT OF THE EXAM!!,"This was a great resource for my Internal Medicine boards because I saw alot of material right out of the exam, which was a pleasant surprise and probably why I did so well. I used the Q&A in conjunction with the Frontrunners Syllabus, reading a chapter out of the syllabus and then hitting that same chapter in the Q&A book. It was a great way to go."
5,Hands-down my favorite resource for practice questions for ABIM recertification exam.,"I used these q&a (aka frontrunners syllabus companion) with Frontrunners actual syllabus for a high yield review which was really important to me to have found since I started a few months later than everyone else, but passed sans sweat. A real life-saver, so giving this dynamic duo a high high recommend."
5,Exactly what I'd been looking for!,"I was looking for a source of old Q&A for all the medicine on the USMLE Step 3. My friend successfully used Frontrunners Internal Medicine Q&A Review for her Step 3 and used it again with equal success on her Internal Medicine Boards. He said there was no better Q&A review for those 2 exams since it's all clinical medicine. I used it and scored well, but what I liked the most was that the questions are kept short and to-the-point so you're able to get thru alot of Q&A in one sitting. Best of all, the Q&A you see in the book are realistic and train your eye to recognize keywords in the question so you can go right to the answer, which is exactly what I did on my boards! Super find. I'm highly recommending."
5,Woah,I can't believe Name Taken hasn't released a full length album yet. Their music is really good.
2,"COOL LOOKING, BUT MADE LIKE SH*$T!","So I love the way these shoes look, I'm a huge Fluevog fan and have a few other pairs. I wear these ONCE and the buckle BREAKS OFF from the shoe (I'm already dressed, walking from car to hotel.. so that sucked)Anyway, from reading other reviews it seems amazon is not so great with damaged returns, so I took them to shoe repair guy who took a week to fix em and that cost me an extra 12 bucks! I mean I wouldn't mind if I wore them to death but the FIRST TIME??Well, they're still fierce but as you know with some of his shoes a killer on the ball of your foot.Whatever."
2,Very Large and Very Hard to Swallow,"They did help, BUT THEY ARE VERY LARGE, AND VERY HARD TO SWALLOW.I had to break them in half to take them. Will not buy them again."
1,Osteo Bi Flex,After using for 4 weeks can see no improvement. Also pill was difficult to take because of size and shape
2,"Well-written, but that's about it","Luisita Lopez Torregrosa's book is very well-written, but I was not moved by this book, even though it deals with very personal and emotionally painful issues. The author seems extremely detached, even when talking about her ""raw passion."" In fact, Lopez Torregrosa is the least interesting of the characters in the book. Her mother and sister seem like more complex figures. I much prefer Esmeralda Santiago's memoirs, which are far more readable and engaging, even if they sometimes resort to cliches. At least she makes you care for the characters, and her own personal hardships, which Lopez Torregrosa unfortunately does not."
3,A FAMILY HISTORY,"A memoir of the author reminiscing the days of her youth and up to the time of her mother's and then her father's death in Puerto Rico and many other places including Texas and the rest of the world. The children were quite close to each other while young, but as adulthood matured so did the closeness decrease in intensity and by the time everyone attended their father'funeral they had not all been together for 15 years. There is no noise in this story unless you wish to call it the noise of yearnings as this is a pleasant rundown of a family with the highs and lows of life discussed with expertise."
1,Dud,"Not a very interesting book. The author states over and over and over again how emotional she is because her mother died at age 78. She drinks alcohol. Chapter after chapter. However, her love for her mother is never shown in detail, its just mouth service. Blah Blah Blah. I'm so upset. Goal of book is to show author's family is very high class. Does Torregrosa really write for the New Yorker? You'd never know it."
1,Way too much math,"I have followed Benoit Mandelbrot through his excellent book of misbehavior of markets and needed a bit more mathematics than given there to understand better the theory behind his brilliant work. Unfortunately this book is meant for a mathematical statistics post-doctoral fellow and a geeky one at that. I now trust late Benoit Mandelbrot s comment that mathematics behind his seminal work on Fractal geometry is ""impenetrable"". I gave the book away to the local library without reading more than a few pages!"
2,Got less than what I paid for...,"I purchased this TV April 2006, I had no problems until December of 2006. The TV would lose its picture and sound almost every day. I contacted the manufacturer, they said the TV was still covered under warranty. They told me to bring it to one of their authorized repair shops, the only one was over 30 miles away, I asked if I could ship it back to the manufacturer, and was told no. My TV has been in the shop for over 3 months, ASTAR keeps sending the wrong parts to the repair shop, and will not provide them with any support. I contact ASTAR weekly to find out what they are doing about my TV, I just get the run around. ASTAR has made no effort to back their product. Their customer service department seems non-existent.I recommend buying a brand name product... and so did the TV repair shop!!"
1,horrible tv,Dont waste your hard earned money on this peice of crap. I havent even had this Tv for 3 years and already I have to put money into it. It has a cooling problem that makes the tv smoke out the top and the screen has went black already. wish i would have spend my money on a different brand!!!
4,ROLLIIIIIING STARTTTTTTTT :P,"Its a top 10 in arcade simulation cars!Visual effects are incredible. 60 frames p/s, so much speed and very good background settings, it's really hard to race a game that looks so visually impressive. They have also added new effects, making the port of this game better than arcade perfect.just need to calibrate the pad for steering or use a steering wheel!!a must have for all the daytona lovers[...]I JUST NEED TO TEST THE LINK CABLE because it have a multyplayer option maybe for DREAMCAST VS DREAMCAST"
5,Daytona Comes to the Console,"People who enjoyed the arcade version of Daytona will enjoy this game equally. There is just something about the physics and the appearance of the arcade Daytona that I always liked. It doesn't have a million cars to choose from and the car reflections are not as impressive as Super GT... but the game is just fun. I think you'll find the dreamcast version of this game to be just like the arcade version, so you can base your judgement on that."
2,.... an okay game..,"This game is alright if you like doing the same thing over and over like someone said earlier. The graphics are awesome and everything, but where's the fun? I'd recommend San Francisco Rush 2049 before I would this.. but that's just my opinion."
3,??,"I brought this game and it's ok. I don't recommend people spend more money on Dreamcast games. I'm planning selling mine. The game itself is okay, but not fun."
2,Would of been good.....,This game could've gone down as one of te bet racing games ever to hit the DC. But this did not happen for these reasons:No Damage to cars after a crashYou can drive head on into traffic get in a crash that makes you flip 4 times and still be in the race at regular speed.Online play requires multiple downloadsThose are my reasons for giving this game a 2 you don[t]... ha[v]...e[t]...o believe me but if your shopping for a racing game on the DC just pretend you never saw this one.
1,poor understanding of Sabbath,Once again the Sabbath understanding has been relegated to any day of the week with no understanding regarding it's purpose. We burned the book.
3,Good but with some annoying mistakes,"Ms Amadio has produced the only available biography of the renowned Luftwaffe ace Gunther Rall and she has used many memories from the great pilot in her text. The book has many fine black and white photographs and the text is easy to read but there are some serious drawbacks. Ms Amadio has obviously a limited background on World War II because albeit she gives most of the times a comprehensive synopsis of the war situation she repeats some annoying mistakes, like calling Paulus army ""6th Panzer Army"", or mistaking 1943 for 1942 in page 195, stating that in September 1943 the Afrikakorps was about to collapse (!), or that Hitler was about to fire General Franz Halder (!), things that happened many months before. Despite its shortcomings the book remains the best source on Rall and his wartime carreer is covered in satisfying depth as well as his post war activities."
4,Dennis Sullivan,"Some reviewers gave this book low marks but I enjoyed reading it, granted there are other books that have more historical facts and information but I imagined General Rall sitting in a chair across from the author and answering her questions and having conversation about his life and views more than just giving an actual day by day account of his WWII days. I believe he was very careful about what he said as he made several references to doing what he could to help Germany and it's people regain their self respect and the trust of the world after the defeat of Hitler's Third Reich and to make sure no one like Hitler could ever come to power again anywhere and how Democratic Nations must be prepared to defend themselves against Nations looking to go on the offensive as Nazi Germany did. General Rall went to great lengths to make sure that no one would misinterpret what he had to say. Since the book was authorized by him I would imagine that he was pleased with it.I know I was."
1,DON'T DO IT!!,"For what I paid for this item, I expected a quality product. What I got was something that someone put together on their home computer and had bound at Kinko's. They could have at least made sure the black ink was full. Some of the images, including the cover, are crooked and not centered on the page and the pages themselves are all of different weights of paper. And, for a 2005 calander, it would be nice to enjoy it during 2005. I ordered on 11/21/04 and it was not shipped until 2/6/05. So much for what was originally a Christmas gift for a huge Bukowski fan! If the maker/seller had taken the time, and the money charged to me, to have this professionally done in a timely manner, this had the potential to be a wonderful and original item, but I could have done this myself much quicker, cheaper, and with better quality......stoned!"
1,an insult...,"ZERO stars....Hank would have killed anyone who bought something like this... a fetid cash-grab...is he to become a cult-of-personality item to be capitolised on like everyone else? This kind of S**T is EXACTLY what he hated and fought against in his work; respect the ideal and buy a Simpsons calendar or something. I'm insulted that Montfort, whom Bukowski trusted and let into his privacy, would stoop this low. What's next, collector's cups at Burger King?"
3,Great recipes for Herman.,I had not been given Herman in many years. When he recently turned up again I wanted some new recipes. I found the name of this cookbook in an old newspaper article about Herman that I had saved from several years ago. I was pleasantly surprised that I could get a copy through Amazon.com. The book is packed with all kinds of recipes and all that I have tried have been quite tasty. You can't go wrong with this one.
3,Tiger Avon Construction Overview,"While not as detailed as the Ron Champion book, this Tiger Avon build book gives an overview of how a Ford Sierra based, independent rear suspension ""Seven Type"" car is built. It's a useful book to have if you're planning to build your own Seven-type roadster from scratch. There is a useful section on how they built a fibreglass body for a small formula type single seater as well.I'm giving it only 3 stars because I own almost all Seven books available on Amazon and I think the Ron Champion (Easier to read) & Keith Tanner (Lots more full colour, step-by-step pictures but lacking info on building the frame because he bought one) books are higher up on my list of priorities. However, if you're thinking of building your own Sevenesque car, then this book is a must-have!"
3,Great for any civics teacher discussing the 2nd Amendment,"This February 1st, 1982 video presents the story of a small town who takes on the NRA and 2nd amendment proponents when they completely ban handguns in the city limits. While this story is 18 years old, it proves that the controversy and the debate over the interpretation over the Second Amendment is not a newly debated topic, but rather a heated issue that provokes citizens and lawmakers to meet at the arena of passionate opposition. The arguments that each side use are still the same used by the National Rifle Association and the National Coalition to Ban Handguns, and their advocates today. This Nightline ABC video, with a much younger Ted Koppel, clearly outlines the controversy over the right to protect oneself and the right of a city to do what they feel is necessary to curb/prevent violent crime. I would definitely purchase an updated video on this topic, but I would surely find that the old arguments are still used on both sides."
1,Overpriced junk,"Very nice case housing a buck-three-eighty piece of Chinese trash movement. If the alarm worked, if the chime function worked, if the icons on the submicroscopic LCD display were visible or the Owner's ""Manual"" addressed what these flyspecks were supposed to indicate, it would be a cool, if overpriced, toy. It wouldn't blow if the phosphor could hold a glow for more than ten minutes either.As it is, find another toy for yourself or give it as a present for someone you really dislike."
3,Comment from the author,"I absolutely agree with the general consensus here that Quick Start books are NOT recommended for those who have any significant experience in music software. However, the books have been well-received by people who find today's music software intimidating, and that is the target audience.Music Sales, the publisher, has always stressed in their promotional materials that the Quick Start series is for *absolute beginners* who want to get up and running fast, but apparently that message is not getting across.I appreciate the opportunity to clarify this, as like any other author, I want people to be satisfied with their purchases and not buy something for the wrong reasons."
2,Free manual is better...,"This book is REALLY thin, large print, essentially a very basic guide to Reason. You'd do much better to download the demo of Reason and take a look at the accompanying documentation or simply go to the Propellerheads.se site and read the synopses for each of the tools included in Reason. It might seem complex (there's a lot in it!), but Reason is for the most part very straight forward-- you'll learn everything in the book by playing w/ the free demo in about 5-10 minutes. The only thing you may need to look up is how to output matching MIDI data for the REX files (that's in the docs).As far as the book goes, I suggest looking at it in person first and get it only if you've got a bit of extra cash in your pocket. My recommendation: Pass on this and use the $[money] toward buying the real app."
1,Save your Money,"Save your money buy the ""Users' Guide to Propellerhead Reason 2"" by Derek Johnson and Debbie Poyser. Even if you know nothing this book will get you going on the road a lot better than this waste of money (sorry still a little bitter).I didn't know much about Reason, but I knew more than this book. This book is too basic even for the most green of neophytes.Believe me."
1,very shallow for someone who understand music software...,"it's very thin,it's very basic,it costs too much!i'm sorry but you can spend 30 minutes on the demo and know it all.i think it's for the first time ever user-music software encounter, if you are not new to music creation tools don't spend your money, belive me.if you don't have a clue about music creation and soft-synthsthen it's a very basic book that you'll read and won't touch again after an hour,sorry"
2,Average at best,I think there's so few games on the PS2 that even releases of average quality can appear at first to be high quality as you have nothing to compare them to... Ring of Red is an example of this.Sure it's pretty and has some nice ideas - but this is not a replacement for classic mech games such as Front Mission 3. There are some interesting additions such as the soldiers but very frequently missions become extremely repetitive - there isn't enough variety to keep you coming - at it's heart it's a very simplistic strategy game which drags out R..E..A...L...L...Y S....L...O...W...L...Y thanks to the 'innovative' realtime combat system (which you can't even pause if you need to go and do something!).Sure you've bought a PS2 and your desperate for something to play on it - but hold out a bit longer - there must be some good stuff on the horizon?! ;-) Musn't there?In the meanwhile get your copy of SSX and boot it back up - much better!
3,ok game,"Even though I never played the game, it still looks just dandy. I hope it is like Barneys adventure, because that is my favorite game."
4,Finished feeling empty...,"Ring of Red is an incredible strategy game by Konami (makers of everything from Contra on the NES to Metal Gear Solid 2 for the PS2.) This game will take well over 30-40 hours to play for you marathon gamers. I was rather unhappy with the ending for it ended abruptly. I hope Ring of Red II will come out soon to tie up the loose ends in this one. A couple things that would benefit this game would be some sort of voice dialouge, the ability to forward through the intermissions quicker, and more special abilities. All in all this was a fun game to play and an excellent strategy for the PS2."
4,Not Bad!,"This game is pretty good, if u like mechwarrior or srategy games. The game has decent grahpics and is worth buying. The only thing dissapointing about this game is the format. The game should of let you be more people besides the Mech, or robot. the game should of let you be the infantry, or rocket launchers. Then i would of gave the game five stars. All in all its a pretty good game and it has a good story to it."
3,Try it first.,This is not your typical game but very appealing. You might want to borrow or rent it before you purchase it. I have had many friends love it and some hate it. It's up to you but it would be wise to try it first! The gameplay can be very slow and time consuming in parts but for the most part it keeps a o.k. pace.
1,a waste of time,"i dont see how people could like this game. the gameplay is extremely slow, ive pretty much beaten the game but, i think it is a complete waste of time to play"
1,Not a game.,"This is a comic book. With too much plot. Endless pages of text dialog you must scroll through before getting to even a very short action sequence. Even the action is dull and has too much dialog. After a while, I quit reading and just kept pushing the buttons to get through the text and get to some action. If you're looking for action - look elsewhere."
1,Weak,"This is an awful game. The gameplay is really weak. I was hoping that this might be a great strategy game for the PS2, but it was a very lame action game that tries to throw in some strategy aspects and fails at both attempts. You control a group of mecs and the strategy lies in moving them around a ""chess board"" type landscape. The action part of the game involves you deciding when you want to shoot the other mec. Basically, a timer starts ticking, and as the seconds pass, your accuracy rating increases. If you shoot too early, you will probably miss the other mec. If you wait too long, the other mecc will hit you first and throw you off guard, resetting the accuracy gague. That's it. Finally, you top that off with the fact that there are truly awful cutscenes after every move and there is no way to bypass them. This game is a big thumbs down."
4,Shell Shock at 85%,"Mechwarrior fans will lover Ring of Red because it is very closely related to the game. Ring of Red is a story about WW2 not ending with the bombing of Japan. The war dragged on and brought in a new style of combat that involved Mechs. The gameplay learning curve takes a while to master. Once you identify which mechs and squads to match up against oppossing enemy then it becomes very fun. However one thing about this game is that they seemed to cut some elements of the game that should have been there. For example voice-overs, the game could have used voice-overs! And they could have used animations thru the breifing stages and small cutscenes. But the game is still fun but reading thru all the dialogue makes me feel like im in front of my old Playstation again. But all in all its a great game that may have been rushed to fatten the game market for PS2."
4,Good Game,This game is challenging and takes a while to play. Fun game though. I didn't know what to expect when I picked this game up but it suprised me. Strategy is what this game is all about and it gets a little frustrating in some parts. But that is what a strategy game is all about :-). Pick this one up if you feel like being challenged and have the money.
4,good,good consept for a game good grafic and story game play too it is jast a rely hard game to play
1,this game is the worst i ever played,this game sucks. graphics suck gameplay sucks cars suck there are three angles to drive from and all are bad. and its impossibly hard. if there was a 0 i would have rated it that. its TERRIBLE!!
2,"Long To Load, Bad To Go Fast And Control","... When you race, you can't go fast at all! Controlling is impossible to do. I never won a race! The computer players are much to hard. The only time I ALMOST won was against my dad in MULTI-PLAYER MODE. you can't stay on the road! With no control you end up in the middle of nowhere!Speed: 0Control: 0Go off track: 5Stay on track: 1PLUS+ My friends also hate it.But maybe I'm not just a 4 x 4 guy. Because they got all different selections of diffrent companies and colors. Last, you can even make your mom or dad's truck drive.well, I don't like it. But kids over 13 will."
1,Don't waste your money,"I rented this game from BlockBuster to see if I would enjoy it enough to buy it, and IMO this game was not even worth the $6 rental fee. Although the graphics are certainly beautiful, a combination of unrealistic physics, quirky handling and boring tracks ruins the game. Even worse, the game crashed with the following message before I had even logged 1/2hr of play time:Invalid Vehicle Number! File: Truck.o line 2027Save your money and buy Smuggler's Run or ATV Offroad Fury."
2,A helpful hint,"This adaptor has the aperture stop down rim, which pushes in the small pin on the back of an m42 lens to allow the aperture blades to close as you move the aperture ring. For lenses which have the switch to move between M and A mode, this is entirely unecessary, and can even become a problem with some lenses. I know that the Pentax Super Takumar 50mm f/1.4 will have problems focusing to infinity on adaptors with this rim. Save yourself the trouble and find out without a rim."
3,Not bad.,"Graphics are fair. The text can be hard to read and seems to be made for a much larger screen (ours is 27"" and the text was cramped and painful to read.)The open map is wonderful, and having the ability to explore wherever and whenever is a plus.CONS:The dialogue is painful. All the voices seem to be done (badly) by the same person.Having only one character option also kind of sucks, but it's understandable since it's a set storyline.Over-all it was entertaining, but not something I'd play over and over again."
2,"Good graphics, bad game play","I tried this game and was very disapointed, I thought it would be a oblivion type game or at least a great story RPG, its not much of either. The graphics are great but it freezes every few mins because of all the grass graphics and such. I guess you could get more indepth with the game and have more of a story line, I personaly beat the game in 4 hours max. You can just hack and slash your way through it the designers left alot of bugs in it so you can get past doing alot of stuff by simply killing quest people, which takes alot out of the game.Above all its a 2/5 for me. It has a online mode but the southpeak game servers are so laggy with online play its like watching your character do the matrix in slow mo the whole time you play. I'd say its only worth the 10 bucks if you really want fast gamer points"
3,A fair game but not Oblivion,"I must first admit the whole time I played this game I found myself constantly comparing it to Oblivion ( which I loved ). This might not be fair and is biased on my part. The only conclusion I came to was that there is no comparison between the two. If you like role playing games you will find some measure of enjoyment from Two Worlds although small. The multi player is weak and that is due to server lag. Single player is also weak and repetitive. I was able to finish this game in its entirety in just two weeks. Taking into consideration it took me 6 months to finish Oblivion, Two Worlds is short lived. I would suggest renting this game before purchasing it like I did."
2,Not good,"This game sucks and I actually played it for a while. I think that sums up the reviews, both the bad and good ones. Its not a good game people. Some have simply chosen to seriously overlook all its flaws to enjoy the few likable things about it. Things such as the weapons and as any rpg player loves, the leveling up aspect. But everything else about it is very dull and not worthy of today's standards. How can a game like this come out quite a few years after games like Oblivion? A true step back. 2/5 and that is kinda generous for the most part."
3,Eh..,"This game was not at all what I had hoped for..The learning curve was ridiculous..The graphics are high PS2 range at best..The gameplay/controls would NOT be easy to get used to at all if you haven't played a game like this before..And the storyline is mediocre at best..Get this game only if you have A LOT of time to kill.. Because it's going to take a while just to get used to it, then to get into it, and even longer to painfully drudge through the whole thing.."
2,Exact opposite of fun.,"The first second i got this game i was excited to play i always love unboxing RPG's. As soon as i played the game the font was so incredibly small i couldn't read it on a 32"" HDTV. That wasn't the least of my issues. I entered the game to discover graphics that are from 2000. Aside from the graphics, don't listen to the people who say the voice acting is good. It is literally the same male and female for ever character. The sounds don't differentiate at all which is a major issue for modern games. That aside too the story is non-linear, but all side quests are the same, go fetch for a reward, quests. The main storyline is crap, frankly, and i didn't, no couldn't play it because it was so bad. I'm happy i bought it a [...]$ because thats ALL it's worth. Do not buy this game if your looking for fun, buy it to be put to sleep, and turned off of video games."
3,Not Great but far from bad,The game has flaws as many other reviews can point out but overall the game is engrossing and fun. There is a steep learning curve so give it several hours of play before you make your judgement. I found myself getting over the flaws very easily after really getting into the story.As to Multiplayer I've played very little. When I got the game on the day it came out Lag was horrible but the time or two I've tried it since it seems to have steadied out. I would recommend renting first if you have the opportunity.
1,Worst 360 Game Hands down.,First of all i'm not going to try and compare this game to Oblivion because as far as i'm concerned it doesn't hold a candle to it. This Game has graphics that are worse then current gen games. It baffles me that such a ugly game can have such horrible frame rate. The blood effects resemble something from a genesis or snes game. Horrible voice acting that doesn't even sync up correctly with the lips movement. This game proves that if it isn't well known or hyped up it probably won't be any good.
1,NOT A NEXT-GEN EXPERIENCE,"This game is a sad joke. Control is sloppy, animations are sluggish and the whole thing runs at a frame-rate that should put the developers to shame. The voice actors are appalling and the story is hardly inspired. I can't believe Microsoft even licensed this tripe. What a waste."
4,Decent Game,"People who give this game 1 or 2 stars probably gave up because they got lost from the start or couldn't overcome the learning curve.I thought the game was really bad at the start but after about 6-7 hours of play i finally just started to grasp the quest system, combat system, and just in general how to use the map and interface. Once you learn how to do quests and where it go it actually does get alot more fun.So I'd say give the game a chance. (ps. i loook cool with my hooded robe w/ mage moves ohh yeah)"
4,Good game,"This is a good game. Occupied the kids for quite a few days. Unlike Halo, didn't keep them entertained for hours on end."
1,Two steps WAY BACK,"I'm an RPG fanatic and enjoy playing practically all of them (even the bad ones). However, poor voice acting/writting, terrible graphics (especially for a 360 game that came out AFTER Oblivion, one of the best RPG's of all time), average combat, and horrendous char system make this game practically unplayable. 4 stats? 1 race? Next Gen RPG? NO! Two Worlds takes RPG's/Gaming two steps WAY back!"
2,Gar.Bage,"This game was poor in many ways, but you could have fun with it. What disappointed me most (besides a poor interface and spotty game progression) was the ending. Also, I ran around the map at a pretty low level, avoiding encounters (I was bored). I ran into a person who immediately progressed my story WAYYY ahead, in a way that made little sense, taking into account the fact that I yet to complete a number of quests. I guess I was ""supposed"" to have completed more of the game before I went to that part of the map. So much for ""freedom!"""
1,Worst XBOX 360 title I've ever come across,"I bought this game hoping for a decent RPG, I was sorely dissapointed. I had to shut it off when my horse kept getting stuck on items in the environment, such as rocks and walls. The game will not let you get off the horse or dismount and you are forced to restart. I asked the employee at the game store and he told me that I should bring the game back becaue it is the worst game on the system. That is the first time I ever had a store advising me to bring back merchandise the sold to me. The game was shipped out unfinished with significant bugs. This game shouldn't even be given away."
1,Two Woes,"This game is a ""woeful"" attempt to recapture the imagination and adventure of Oblivion. I found it incredibly dissapointing. I was excited as everyone else, geeking out, to play a new fantasy inspired adventure. I liked the idea, the premise that something happened to your sister and it was a part of a much larger story. Great. Then I began playing the game and I wanted to pull my eyes out of their sockets. Terrible interface. Ridiculously stupid combat. The worst inventory management imagined. Voice acting from an episode of Dark Shadows (70s version) or freaking Canterbury Tales. Graphics that would have been good on the original Xbox but hardly next gen. A waste of time and money. Maybe a renter, but one that would be played and then forgotten about when you get a request to go play Lost Planet or Gears with a friend. Avoid this at all costs, it will rob you of your joy."
1,"Not worth the money, or the eye strain","I was really hopeful when I got this game, but that only lasted about 4 minutes into play. I loved Diablo II on the PC and Oblivion on 360, and was looking for another good RPG. Bad choice! The entire design does not suit the 360. Fighting and spell casting are tedious. You can barely see the minimap or read the text in the quest tab. It will take you a very long to scroll through the variety of items in your pack. And riding the horse was incredibly difficult--the controls reminded me of old-time tank simulators (push left-right to turn, regardless of which way the camera is facing, and very crude speed control).I'm glad I bought this used at a certain brick-and-morter that allows returns: I'm going to get something else. You should, too."
2,Two worlds? More like two stars.,"The seller did a great job sending this game but when I played it, it was terrible game. They start you out like you know everything and they make you do stuff that doesn't make much sense."
2,Over Hyped,"I was very anxious to try out this game since I have a love for RPG's and read great things online about it. I bought this years ago when i was trying to find good RPG's for the Xbox 360 and only Oblivion was around. Although this game was a good concept, I could not get over the horrible dialog. It was not synced up with the characters lips, as well as not being spoken fluently. Very choppy and alien sounding. Also, there were a few other things i could get over with the game play. I could not read any thing from the menu because the type was so small. I tried this for about an hour and gave up. I ended up trading it for store credit at Game Stop."
3,very glitchy game,I bought the game just to have it.........and when I played it I found it very difficult to get into because of the low framerates and the low graphics ...................this game can also piss you off a lot!
2,Stick with Oblivion,"I reserved this game about two weeks ago, and picked it up first thing this morning. After about 3 hours of playing, I must say that I am HIGHLY disappointed. The graphics are beautiful when you are still, but when you begin to run, the backgrounds are choppy and jagged. As if the framerate didn't slow enough during single player mode, during multiplayer the game is nearly unplayable. The game has a very raw, unfinished feel to it, and isn't near of the same quality as Oblivion. I would HIGHLY recommend renting this game before making a decision to drop $60 on it. I sure wish that I would have."
1,Unbelievably Horrible,"Wow... Has there ever been a game so hyped that turned out to be this incredibly AWEFUL? I was SO looking forward to this game. Believe me, I wanted to like this! And then... Where do I start? The graphics look like something from 10 years ago. At best! The game is clunky and old hat, with nothing to make you even want to explore the world. And by far the worst offender is the ungodly voice acting. I swear you have never heard anything as horrible and ridiculous as the dialogue in this game. Please do not buy this piece of garbage! I am not one of thos muckrakers out there just looking for stuff to complain about. I love games and really wanted this to be good, but it's not even remotely passable. This is a total rip off of your money and everyone involved in the making and promoting of this game should be ashamed of themselves. You have been warned!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
1,I wish I never set eyes on it!!!!,"I thought this game look so much like Oblivion. I was so really looking forward for it's release.1. I am so displeased on the graphics! It looks like a rough draft of a game. It doesn't qualify as being an XBOX 360 game.2. It's hard to get the hang of the controls.3. The talking is so cheesy. It sounds like they only had one person to record the whole thing. Plus he sounds monotone.4. The font. It's So small. I can't even read any of the menus. We have to sit 2"" away from the T.V.5. You can't really design a guy. It's like ""this is how he's suppose to look like, you can make him tan, give him white hair or make him tall. But other than that you can't change the way he looks.""6. It shouldn't be compared to MORROWIND or OBLIVION! Not even in the same class.IN all I wish I didn't pay no more than $10 for it. OBLIVION IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS GAME!!!!!"
1,"The worst RPG, maybe ever game, that I have ever played","This game lacks in every single way (Grapics,gameplay,weapons,story...) I sold this game 2 game sessions after buying it and will never waist my time playing it again. It was kind of fun to run around in underwear like a jackass after realizing there is no value in the game itself..."
1,Overhyped and just plain terrible...,"I was really excited about the idea of a multiplayer ""Oblivion-like"" game for the 360. I had it preordered and the day it came out I got it home and was very disappointed. The graphics were not next gen, all the character models were horribly rendered, and the voice acting and story just seemed awful.Overall, worst next gen game I've ever played."
1,The Worst RPG Ever!,This game is the worst role-playing game I've ever played.Don't Belive that it's the same asElder Scrolls IV Oblivion. It's not. Oblivion is Much better. Two Worlds Doesn't Deserve to be compared to Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion.
1,Worst game ever!!!,"I can't believe I even spent money on this game. The animation glitches constantly, the combat is a joke, and the voice acting makes me want to kill myself. The only thing I regret more than buying this game is convincing my friends to by it as well. DO NOT buy this game you will be disappointed."
2,"Weak, Retro, and Confusing","With graphics from games we played on the Apple 2e and an Inventory that only one of the designers could possibly understand, I can't understand why SouthPeak is still in business. This is a complete waste of time, money and just about anything else a gamer might have.My favorite ""feature"" is how the ""hero's"" eyes are almost always crossed in the cut scenes and conversations."
5,The Adventures of Swiss Family Robinson,"I would have to say that when I saw this series I was amazed by the setting the scenery, the plot the theme and overall the sense of home. The series is one that will take your breathe away. From shipwrecking on the island, to pirates, to love, to the return to the island you learn about the castaways and how they turned a disaster into a life of praise."
3,"Works well, but not great.",Could be either a little longer or more edging. Boat keeps popping it up & we have to keep reattaching. Will try to find larger next time.
4,Excellent reading of the Bach,"I bought this CD primarily for the historical value of hearing a 28 year old Ben Heppner do the short ""Er kommt, er kommt!"" tenor recitative in the Bach ""Wachet auf"" cantata. While still sounding like a lyric tenor, the latent power in his voice is very evident, even in this early recording. It's also a treat to get to hear the cantata in its orchestral arrangement, rather than just organ - and the chorus is the real star of the show here, not Mr. Heppner. They pull off the difficult runs in the opening movement seamlessly, and never sound anything less than terrific. The Handel concerto is also well-done, as is ""The enchanted forest,"" but the excellent reading of the Bach is the real reason to own this disc."
3,Has great potential,Robert Randolph is an amazing performer no matter what way you cut it. He plays his slide guitar better than anyone has attempted for awhile and has some real pumpin tunes. The one that are lacking are the slower numbers which in my view destroy what could have been an amazing disc. next time more funk.
3,So close but so far away...,"This CD is like an intro to Robert Randolph and the Family Band. You basically get a bunch of introductions to the grooves this band can produce. However, when you get into the groove, the song fades out. These are some short songs as far as jam bands go. The great intros this band collaberates on leave the listener unsatisfied in the end. If you like jam bands check out these guys live. They rock and are unrestrained, unlike this CD which only slightly reflects the style and talent this band has. This CD only scratches the surface."
4,"Great music, why doesn't my computer like it?","Neither Windows Media Player (9) nor Winamp 3 or even Windows Explorer can see any cd audio files on this disc to play the music tracks on my computer CD or DVD drives. I finally convinced a version of MusicMatch to play it. Maybe keep the return info handy in case you normally listen to CDs on your computer and your players can't make it work.But yeah, like others have said, it's a great record! A really unique sound. Funky, bluesy, 70s retro and contemporary all at once."
5,Way to go!,"Robert Randolph has to be one of the most most underappreciated talents of the new millenium! This brother does for the steel pedal guitar what Jimi Hendrix did for the electric guitar and what Larry Graham did for the Fender Bass back in the day! His material is a raw mix of rock, funk and blues with lyrics that are spiritual but aren't too preachy! If today's industry emphasized true talent, originality and musicianship over looks and commerciality, this guy would be a phenomenon! Don't miss ""Unclassified"" please!"
5,Unique Sound and Oh So Funky,"Hands down, ""Unclassified"" is the best album of 2003. Robert Randolph and the Family Band are a collection of amazing musicians who write unique tunes that groove like no others. Randolph's plays pedal steel guitar like you've never heard, ripping riffs over the incredible funky bass lines of Danyel Morgan, whose sweet falsetto nicely complements the gutteral roar of Randolph's vocals. This is a must own"
2,Songwriting Skills Not on Par with Guitar Virtuosity,"I bought this album after seeing the band's electrifying performance on the Clapton 2010 Crossroads video and then, being unfamiliar with the band, went through the reviews here to try to find the ""best album."" I don't agree that this is 4 or 5 star material or performances. The songs, except for the mostly instrumental ones, are rather ordinary and even those don't sizzle (like the live performances on Crossroads.) And the production quality is not great either--you can't really hear him matching his voice to the guitar when he does that. After two run-throughs, this will go in the heap of CD's that I had great hope for but never listen to. Great player, but mediocre songwriter: probably explains lack of more widespread popularity and playing at smaller venues."
2,Robert Randolph is a huge Contradiction...,"Okay, I was all prepared to like this, even love it--being a session guy with a background in soul, pop, roots rock, and country, and also one of the few steel guitarists in Los Angeles, I figured that it would strike some sparks--not destined to happen, baby. Though I have to give Randolph props for technical speed and passion, the material is a grave disappointment--juvenile, repetitive, shallow, and uninteresting. And no, it can't be revived by the infusion of the abovementioned energy--it just don't work. The tunes are decent funk-rock, in the vein of Sly, but the playing is at times overbearing, scalar and unpleasant, with occasional flashes of brilliance...more puzzling than interesting, more annoying in the constancy of the riffing than fun. Sorry, Robert, but this bird don't fly. And it definitely don't sing..."
2,2nd album from pedal steel great.,"I was soooo excited to get this record after live at the wetlands. i loved the sound on that record. i bought this one, popped it it, tryed to get in to it, but it didnt happen! the sound is so ""tinny"". the drums are like 80's rock drum sounds(oh no!), the ""slapping"" bass gets real quik, real fast. and the pedal steel sound is very..... thin sounding. thats what i loved about the first record, great tone! but this record didnt do it for me. chek out ""LIVE AT THE WETLANDS""."
2,Not impressed at all,"A buddy of mine heard it and just ""had to have it"" after hearing so much of it at the local music store. Well I never heard of them before and I'm very open to music. I don't care what kind it is I'm generally open to all sorts. Well anyways my buddy hypes it all up and I'm eager to listen to it. I've listened to it straight through and I maybe find 2 or 3 songs that are good. The rest just doesn't do anything for me. Maybe the next album will be better?"
2,Wasn't what I expected,"The CD was not what I expected. There were only two songs that I liked. If you like popsy, jamband kinda music, you might like this CD."
2,Not quite what I was expecting...,"All the songs are a bit forced and are following a cliche in the succession of theme intro + guitar solo + bass solo +theme and so on.Surprisingly, I found the guitar playing pretty dull and repetitive."
1,Over Hyped,"Randolph needs someone to write his material...weak songwriting--at points the steel inspires but the playing becomes repetitive. explosive and fun at first, but cold and boring after further investigation--just like my first wife."
2,Homeboy says go home RR.,"Not a bad record. If you want to hear good musicians playing bad songs. These guys should be playing another person's material.I mean it! Think about the absurdity of the lyrics. ""I need more love."" Who doesn't need more love? I'd like to know why love is important to you. ""Soul Refreshing""? I can't say if this is a pun or not. But I will tell you that that ""soul"" is a tired word. Remember the Beatles ""Rubber Soul""?; it was a lousy pun 40 years ago; ""Soul Refreshing"" is a step in a much worse direction. If anyone uses the word ""soul,"" they really need to mean it.If you want to hear good songs look elsewhere--ryan adams, bruce springstein, nick drake, duke ellington..... God bless."
4,Best guitarist I'd never heard of,"I caught Robert Randolph on a recent rerun of Austin City Limits, on public tv. I was totally blown away! Though I'd never heard of the guy, I was completely glued to the set and looked him up the next day. This cd has spent most of its time in my player since I got it, though I will have to admit that he's even better live than he is in this studio effort. Definitely worth a place in your collection."
3,Dont let the photo mislead you...,"While Imex pioneers might do well for a diorama, they are super detailed, I was under the impression these would be larger figures. If you get these please be aware this is 1/72 not 1/32 .( 1/32 is about the size of your average plastic soldier.)"
2,Long LIve 90's Nick,"I really wish 90's nick would be put onto DVD. I was trying to find the show cousin skeeter and I can't find it. I like some of the shows they have on now but most of them I just find stupid. I especially have my issues with spongebob. I con't figure out if he is 1. an adult or a kid, and 2. a boy or girl. At least with the shows in the 90's I was able to tell what the character was as far as gender and age goes. They really need to put 90's shows on DVD. Does anyone know who I could talk to about this happening?"
2,BRING ON 80's NICK!!,"Why is it that these new shows are highlighted, but not the old school stuff? Aren't there already dvd's for most of these shows? And shows like ""Fairly Odd Parents"" are great, but my DVR can pick up a dozen shows in a few days time...Some one before me wanted 90's Nick, I am all for that. But what about us REAL old schoolers? You can't Do That on Television, The Pinwheel cast, Out of Control!, Todays Special!""Nick, for real...look who has the $$$$ now, WE DO!!!! the Television Generation born in the 70's and DYING for nostalgia....GIVE IT TOO US!!!!!!:)"
1,Give us what we WANT!,With no Angry Beavers or Rockos Modern Life this dvd just doesn't deliver what I'm looking for. Nick- take the hint! Give us what we WANT!
1,out with the new and in with the old,"man i wish they would make the round house for dvd , now that was the show right there that tought me everything i needed to know growing up."
1,OLD NICK,"I agree with everyone that wants old nick. I remember putting on the TV and watching Legends Of The Hidden Temple,Guts,Are You Afraid Of The Dark? and so on. Put them on dvd. People would SURELY buy it."
1,OLD IS GOLD!,everyone said pretty much everything - i was searching for an old Nick show (Ahh! Real Monsters) and i got this. the old Nick shows were - as said - original in their ideas and animation (though i kinda prefer anime) - but at least you wont mix 'em up like you do now. the fairly odd parents is ok - i do enjoy it sometimes - but they got that phantom show that kinda look exactly like it! WHY? not a lot of cartoon artists? hire the ones Disney fired (although the new cartoon artists are not as good as the old ones during the classical times of Snow White & Cinderella..hmmm ok so i'll take it upto the early 90s to Aladdin but that's about it!)anyway - i think i made my point clear. bring on the old shows on DVD - it's what us - your humble faithful viewers love to have - not some bunch of cloned shows (with all due respect)
3,"The Old Nick Shows, Please","Mine will be a familiar refrain; the old Nick shows, please. That Saturday night line-up was the absolute best. My kids and I shared many special evenings watching those shows, and now that they've grown up and moved on, I'd like to recapture some of that magic. As someone else has already commented; my check is written, just produce the goods."
1,Agreeing with everybody else.,"It's this simple: I won't be buying this.Give me ""YOU CAN'T DO THAT ON TELEVISION"" and ""SALUTE YOUR SHORTS"". Please complete ""CLARISSA"" and ""PETE AND PETE"". I'll buy those.I've already written out a check for what these will cost. Now I wait....."
1,Why can't we go back to the good ol' days of Ren and Stimpy?,"With a few good shows, this is moastly full of Nick's new crap like All Grown Up, Danny Phantom, and My Life as Teenage Robot. Let's just watch sometihng reasonable like Ren and Stimpy. Most of the shows here aren't that bad, but those three are so stupid and politically correct they should be destroyed forever.Zorgin Hmorgin is bettah than this im a luxie"
3,i luv nick!!!!!!!!!! by hilfan90210 from l.i.n.y.,"first of all the farily odd parents iz abbrivated fop not tfo.2 of all sbsp+fop are my 2 favez on nick. when i waz a kid (in 1999) my favez were rr+sbsp i rember when each toon came out (exept 4 rr cuz i wuznt born den):rr:1991(member da 10yr special wuz in 2001)sbsp:1999jn+fop:2001(jn wuz da first toon,den fop)mltr+agu:2003(!1 month apart)dp:2004anywayz, i hope dat da new toon:avatar comez on 1 of dezeali"
1,Bring back the old shows!!!!!,"why wouldent they bring back the old shows, like doug, clarissa exlains it all, are you afraid of the dark, ren and stimpy, the classic rugrats, wild and crazy kids, lets get out of nickolodean, i want to see some old x men cartoons, captain planet, goosbumps, i want the old tgif back on abc, the line up of boy meets world, sabrina, and they were other great shows that i forgot about, and what about hey dude, excellent shows, the shows on now suck"
1,Nickelodeon is still my favorite channel to watch. Where's the old stuff?,I do agree with everyone who gave this one star. I WANT THE OLD NICKELODEON SHOWS ON THIS DVD!!! I don't have this DVD but I want to review anyway. I watched this channel since I was little. I still watch it now. At least there's a channel called Nicktoons Network that I can watch. I wish they would make a network called Nickelodeon Oldies and Favorites. That would be awesome!
2,Why dont the creators get to choose?,"It would make so much sense. The creators can easily choose which episode is the more reasonable to pick. For example,Danny Phantom,Bitter Reunions was an excellent episode,but in Nick Picks 2, they chose Splitting Images which was not a ground breaking episode at all.Especially with episooes like My Brother's Keeper or Public Enemies. Some episodes are good,but most arent. Give us season sets so we can choose ourselves."
1,Agree and disagree,"True those were great shows......but please.....if we want to include even better shows (and yes i agree - very few today are any good at all), we need to go back to the 80s! Double Dare, You Can't Do That On TV, PinWheel, etc!=)"
3,Not as good as _Bunnicula_,"I have been trying to track down the James Howe ""Chester and Harold"" series ever since I discovered _Bunnicula_. This is the second in the series, but does not feature the vampire bunny beyond a short mention in the first chapter. Chester and Harold go to stay at a pet hotel while their owners are on vacation. They are very uncomfortable, both with the people running the hotel and the other animals (six dogs and one other cat) boarded there... with good cause. This is an enjoyable little mystery, but it does not have the polish of the first book, which James Howe co-wrote with his wife, Deborah (Deborah died shortly after _Bunnicula_ was published). Harold seems just a little too bumbling -- I felt that the first book better captured the behaviors of cats and dogs (or at least the way they might behave when we aren't looking) -- and the wordplay seems a little forced. However, I will continue to read the rest of the Chester/Harold series."
5,It is a well put mystery,I love all of the Bunnicula seris books but this one is my fave. It is comedy and mystery put together in a hair rising tale of 1 dog 1 cat and a newborn puppy.
4,This book is out of this world!,"I liked this book because it had alot of mysterious characters. One of the reason's I didn't like this book was it had no death, or magic,or any quest. But I still liked this book becauseIt had adventure and excitment. And I really think you should read this book."
1,"sucks, what is up with the sound?","Well always wanted to see how this guy plays, seen his bro 3 times all the way back to the 80's. but this is lame, guess you have to be into it? the sound is bad, could be from where they were playing and/or what they used to record it with.also its nothing inspired, they are all just standing and sitting, hanging out. bought it and sold it right away, didnt even need to show anyone, thats how lame it is. But Johnny Winter! woohooo!!Listened with Sennheiser 595's, the best that I have found, had 555 for a couple years they are nice too, but cant touch 595's, pay the dif and see, er I mean hear."
5,These Are Always Good,I feel like a part of the For Better Or For Worse Family. Keep the books coming Lynn.
3,teaching the book,i am so glad that someone did write the teacher addtion because it the book is heard to unnderstand. the way i used was to teach a college class how to undertdand the book and do it buy chapter to chapter not by person to person. the book over all helped me understand how to teach the book so i and the students could understand a lot better. it helped greatly for my students. i have let othere teachers look at it. they enjoyed it very much too. i am getting copy for my brother who has to read the book too. it has helped a great deal because the french grammer was heard to hunderstand in the book it self. this way it takes step by step it takes you threw it too.
1,Stunk!,This was the WORST in the series! You have two bozos trying to be funny that weren't and some of the cheesiest matches ever captured on video. The babes were the only bright spot. If you want to pick a really cool DVD get AMERICA'S WILDEST BACHELOR PARTIES.
4,"Savvy, not Superficial","In reading The Culturally Savvy Christian: A Manifesto for Deepening Faith and Enriching Popular Culture in an Age of Christianity-Lite, by Dick Staub, I was pleasantly surprised. Staub is a professor and pop culture officianado; however, his work is not just another proof-texting of popular culture for theological ideas and agendas. Instead, Staub calls us deeper into cultural analysis and critique, praising what is good, rejecting what is bad. Calling ultra-conservatives out of their cultural cocoons, uncritical evangelicals out of complacency, and aggressive fundamentalists away from combative cultural engagement, Staub charts a course for a very thoughtful, very honest, very redemptive approach to engaging culture."
5,4 great episodes,"My 2 year old son received this DVD for Halloween. There is onlyone Halloween episode, but that's fine. The other 3 episodes (puzzle, monkey bars & storm cloud) are all wonderful. My son requests them over and over, and responds to Dora out loud. I think Dora is a great character for both boys & girls. Even if your child has never watched a Dora episode, this is a very enjoyable way to introduce them to Dora!"
5,This is so cute! And very non-scary!,"My three year old son loves it! And I love it, too!There are four short episodes. The first one is directly related to Halloween. (Dora must help Little Monster find his home.) The second one isn't directly Halloween related, but is on the same theme. (Dora must help put together a puzzle of a wizard.) The third and fourth episodes are not Halloween related.The first episode is adorable. It has a cute, catchy song. It is very sweet!"
5,"Yes, this is a wonderful CD","I bought this CD from the artist, soon after it first came out, at a MarinCounty craft fair...it is an unbelievably high quality and beautiful collectionof his music, and I'm listening to it right at the moment....it is so peacefuland life-affirming..."
4,Tiny but cute,These were tiny little pearls but stacking several of the stretch braclets together made a very attractive cuff braclet.
2,"Good graphics, interesting storyline...but short and dull.","The beginning of the game starts out being interesting and mysterious enough, and the first half of the game (took me a couple hours) was fun to play, but after that it went downhill. The detail is incredible, but the entire game takes place within the space of a few city blocks. You eventually get tired of all the running back and forth between buildings and finding nothing, switching to a new time period only to find nothing and switch to yet another. The time paradoxes are interesting, but some of them really dont make sense, and the endings are rather dissapointing, as well. Depending on the ending you get, the game explains various parts of whats *really* going on, as if you hadnt figured it out the first time. I got all the endings (there are a few pivotal points where the choices you make determine the ending you get) and found it to be an utter waste of time. Replay value is nil, I'll never pick it up again."
5,A great game with a great story!,"This game is a great game. It has a very good storyline and pretty good graphics. If you like games where you have to use your brain and solve stuff, this is your game. The characters are well developed. My only complaint is that the game is not long enough. I can beat the game in a couple of hours. If they make a sequel, I would like it to be a double disc so there can be twice as much. even that little complaint can't take away from this game!"
4,"Great story, puzzles are not very challenging","I think Shadow of Destiny is a great game, the graphics are sharp and realistic (none of that fog in the distance...). Expect to finish the game the first time through in about 5 hours (more or less depending on how experienced you are with adventure games). This game resembles PC adventure games more than console adventure games in that there is no ""action"" (as in you just explore the town, talk to characters and collect items). If you are used to the adventure game genre, I'd say you might find the puzzles easy to solve (not disappointingly easy, but easy enough that you can move the story along without scratching your head) There are 5 endings and an extra mode. If you want all the endings you'll have to go back and replay certain chapters making different choices, which can get a bit tedious. Adventure games for consoles like the ones for PC's are hard to find. I have to say Konami did a great job with Shadow of Destiny. (Sequel??)"
2,Movie or game?,"This so called game has a very good story and plot. It keeps your attention, by making you want to see what happens next. However, the gameplay could not satisfy an 8 year old. Why you ask? Because there is none. You watch 15 minutes of cinematics and then are pretty much told what you have to do. There is really not much thought needed since you are pretty much led directly to where you have to be or the object you need. Oooooh. there are multple endings. Whoopee! You still have to sit through a majority of the same cinematics and virtually do nothing. Out of the 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through the first time, I would estimate that I only needed the controller in my hand for 30 minutes. This makes for a good movie but don't buy it if you actually like to PLAY your games instead of watch them."
5,"Totally Awsome, Must Have","This game leaves me begging for more. Many games I have played get boring after a few hours, but this one is so hard to pull away from that it has almost made me late for work a few times. Graphics are top notch and the story line is very compelling, I have played it through twice and have came up with 2 different endings and I still don't have answers to my questions. I only wish there was a strategy guide."
4,Visually appealing but leaves much to be desired.,"I bought this game after reading the rave reviews and must say, at the risk of sounding picky, that I found the game left much to be desired. The graphics, music, and sound are quite magnificent but the story is disjointed at best and rather insulting to the intelligence. I finished this game in less than two days just through casual play. To be frank I found the ending so hokey-pokey that I had no desire to play the game again to see what other endings there might be. The voice-overs were better than average but many were just plain silly and the dialogue unecessary. I would have given this game three and half stars but unfortunately I didn't have the option. If you are new video games and enjoy visual stimulation without much substance than you will enjoy this game. This reviewer was drawn in at the very beginning but was left wanting more."
3,Wow but oh????????,"The whole idea of this game is just amazing. I find the story captivating. Really the only complaints i have is 1) the voice acting is terrible to the point of funny and 2) Most of the game is just a movie. I mean when i buy a game i want to play not sit and watch. Would i buy this game....probaly not, would i rent this game or borrow it from a friend ..DEFINATLY"
5,Great story!,"I wish I could find more games like this. It's basically a choose your own adventure story (that you can interact with) about time travel, 2 of the best things in this world put together. I loved the story and multiple endings- one of which, without giving anything away, was one of the best twists in a story I've seen since ""The Usual Suspects""."
5,A Leaf from the past,Ben Hur Lampman is in the same league as Dana Lamb. This is one of my favorite piece of fishing literature to share with fellow fishermen. If you loke this book secure a copy of The Coming of Pond Fishes. Ben Hur Lampman was an outdoor writer for the Oregonian.G
5,"Great, wonderful",This is a great piece of fiction that is captivating to both yound and older readers. NO matter what age you are you will most certainly enjoy Savago's book. Your children (if you have any) will be captivated just like i was. Buy this book for loads of enjoyment and entertainmnet while reading.
5,Outstanding! I wish I'd read this book 5 years ago.,"The author is highly knowedgeable and her descriptions and research behind them are authentic and authoritative. It is an enjoyable read and I found it hard to put down! I have lived in Russia for almost 7 years and only regret the time I spent here without having read this insightful and throught-provoking book. I recommend it highly especially for those planning to visit or move to Russia. Russia is a complex and fascinating land which is best enjoyed and appreciated by those with a handful of understanding of her rich and turbulent history and the hidden gems of her culture and values. This book has confirmed many things we have observed in our 7 years here, but also has opened my eyes (and heart) to see and love Russia in new and exciting ways. Although this book is out of print (a loss to us all), it is well worth the work of getting your hands on a copy."
4,"Excellent book for insight into art, history and Russia",The book provides haunting insight into the devistating role that Communism played upon the the genius of Russian art. Each form of art seemed to always end with the huanting reminder that the given form of art continued up until . . . the revolution. It is by default a history of freedom of expression.
2,WORK GREAT WHEN THEY WORK,"2/3 of the flashers I ordered, and re-ordered, didn't work. I'm guessing the batteries are dead in the off the shelf bubble wrapped unit. I don't know if this was due to the manufacturer or the distributer.When the flasher does work it's great: light weight, bright, sturdy, and persistant. We use them on our dog's collar at night for visibility."
4,"Can you say..""Where is the.......""","This book is great for little ones. We loved Good night Gorilla and this book. My daughter loves to play the ""where is the.....(soccer ball, stroller, umbrella, etc.)"" game. I point something out that is on the page and she looks for it. Great picture/word recognition for little ones. My daughter absolutely loves this book. Very little words, but it takes us a long time to read by playing the game mentioned above. One odd thing, the boy puts on his pj's before he takes his bath, But my little one hasn't really noticed it."
5,Full of Fun,Peggy Rathman has a knack for knowing what will keep a small child interested. The very detailed drawings are full of things to find on every page (where are the hamsters numbered 1-10?). If you have other books by her you will see little drawings borrowed from those books. My 5-year-old loves it.
4,10 minutes till Bedtime,"My kids cannot get enough of this book. I ordered it used but in ""very good condition"". This statement wasn't incorrect but when I received the book I noticed that the seller forgot to mention that somebody had stamped the letter ""P"" on two of the front pages. Not a big deal for us (coincidentally our last name starts with a ""P"") but I think they could at least have mentioned this imperfection when they advertised the book."
2,Not a Real Book!,"I was very excited to get this book because of the great reviews and the Caldecott Medal but was quickly disappointed. It is hardly a book. Although it has great pictures and could have easily been a great book, it was not. We read our books (not just look at pictures) and there is absolutely no story here. Page 1...1o mins til bedtime, page 2...9 mins til bedtime, page 3...8 mins til bedtime. That was it-no story-just the same sentence over and over. I have to assume that the artist wrote the book and I really wish that they had brought a real author on board. There was such great potential here but in my opinion it fell flat."
2,"Not as good as ""Good Night, Gorilla"" by the same author.","I had high hopes for this book after reading ""Good Night, Gorilla"", but was disappointed. The ""story"" is just plain weird. The text seems to be geared towards a 2 year old, yet the illustrations are too busy for a toddler."
3,Read description carefully.,Must not have read the details on this used book because it is very used. Torn pages with writing on them. Not worth effort to return since son is still enjoying the story.
5,Enjoyed by both a 6 year old and 2 year old!,"This wonderful book can be enjoy by toddlers and ""Big"" Kids. My 6 year old niece loved to ""read"" this book to her 2 year old cousin. The two year old would pick out hamesters and the 6 year old made up stories about them. Both children had so much fun ""reading"" this book together. The text is very simple - the pictures tell most of the story. And what stories they can tell! Have fun exploring out the pictures with your special little (or big!) one."
5,Our Favorite!,"Our daughter at the age of 1 LOVED Goodnight Gorilla, so I bought 10 Minutes Till Bedtime for her. Now this book has become our family's favorite. Our daughter is now almost 2, and still loves this book. We focus on a different hamster, by number, each time we read the book. You'll discover the clever thoughtfulness of author/artist Peggy Rathmann as you see each hamster doing the same activity - but differently - on each page. It's fun read for toddlers and grownups!"
5,10 Minutes Till Bedtime,"My son LOVES this book and so do I. It is a joy to read, which is great because he reaches for it first every night, and every night it is a different experience! Just so much fun.... you have to get this book to add to your collection! And don't miss a scene from ""Goodnight Gorilla"" happening in the background on the page where the masses of hamsters arrive.... I was amazed. So cool!"
5,"*Great* book, but get the hardcover vs. the board book","My children adore this book, so we've read it many, many times. They still squeal with delight and laughter. There is so much detail, that you can't help but discover something new with each reading (keeping it entertaining for mom and dad as well as Junior). My one recommendation is that you buy the hardcover version versus the board book. We have both. The board book lacks some of the detail of the original."
1,Worst Printer,"When one computer guru talks to another about printers, Epson never comes up, why mention a horrid product when an HP will do it better, faster, quieter, and NEVER break. First off, all Epsons, including this one, all have the printer head built on into the printer, if that goes, which it will usually after 8-12 months, one must go out and buy another printer. HP and Lexmark both have the print head on the cartridge, so if the prints don't look spectacular, get rid of the cartridge, not the printer as you would with Epson. Also Epson's waste so much ink cleaning and cleaning, they use an air system to output the ink to the paper whereas HP and Lexmark use electricity to output the ink, which doesn't require the cleaning. Spend a lttle more and get some quality, buy an HP 932C."
3,Great If You Use It Often,"This printer does an excellent job with any task, especially printing pictures on photo paper. I used my Stylus 880 for five years, and it is the printer that got me through college. However, if you do not use it frequently, very bad things can happen: the ink gums up and then splatters on the page, which gets ink on the rollers, which ruins the next 10 or 20 pages that go through the printer. Occasionally, the paper mis-feeds, crinkles, and causes ink to get thrown around the rollers, again ruining the next 10-20 pages you send through it. If you are planning on using it daily, this is a great machine, but if you plan on using it once in a while, beware!"
2,Good Printer - Terrible Customer Service,"My first printer was defective and Epson replaced it with a refurbished model despite mine being only two days old. The replacement was also defective! The third worked fine. They lost track of the one I mailed back and sent a letter months later threatening to charge me for the ""nonreturned"" unit. Epson promised to replace the ink cartridges wasted in the attempt to repair the first two units. After repeated calls to their (non-toll free number), still no cartidges. The quality of the printing (when it works!) is good."
3,Highly recommend,"I bought this video about one year ago and finally dug it out; although the program is very involved, once you master the exercises, they become very easy and the results are very noticeable; I will be 47 soon and everyone thinks I am 33, no older than 35; when I was 35, people thought I was older. Also, aging is different for everyone. Stick with the program and you will see your youthful contours return."
3,uhhh,"i really gave it 3 stars just because i loved to play army men one and 2 on the pc ahh good times, but this is just a fast way to make money which i played it and it was just worth to rent it then forget it"
2,More Frustration Than its Worth,"This is a big disappointment, the controls are horrible so the Omega is hard to handle. The screen keeps you moving forward so if you miss something or an enemy you can't get them and you have to shoot the enemy off screen. They had the perfect control setting with Sarges Hero's I and II. I agree with everyone else, rent this game first-don't buy it."
1,A poor excuse to release a quick game,"This is the first game in the ARMY MEN series that I've played. Friends told me that the past titles were innovative and clever. If what they had to say is true, then the 3DO company didn't transfer their talents to this game. Even though the game is laid out in a three dimensional setting, I felt as though I was playing 2D Contra on the old NES. Each level is basically the same terrain, but colored differently to give you a sense of ""oh, these must be the mountains"" or ""hey, now we're in the forest."" You have no real decisive power on where the Green Rouge travels or even what pace to keep. A continually scrolling landscape pushes you along as you pummel the tans with a weak targeting system. Long, monotonous, stagnant, boring. If you absolutely must see this game firsthand, then I suggest a quick trip to your local rental store. Even then, you will most likely turn around and drop it in the return box the same day. Erase this one from your curiosity synapses."
1,Another... Game from 3DO,"What can I say? It's 3DO. I don't think 3DO has made a good game since...well...ever. Here's the basic premise of the game: You, a little green piece of *something*, decide to run around shooting little tan pieces of *something*, however, it's so hard to do this, that you might as well use this disc as a frisbee.Best Feature: It turns off!Worst Feature: Everything after pressing ""Start""Final Score: zero out of any number, this game blows!"
2,sarges heroes 2 is better,"dont buy this game. the controls are wacked, it only has a couple of weapons, and the graphics in the actual playing part of it are only ok. if you want an army men game, get sarges heroes 2."
3,Digital DJ,It's very basic for digital DJ. Which is suitable for a absolute biginner.This book could have more of technics on the beat mixing rather than scatching technics.Thanks.
5,Great Value!!!,"This book does a very good job of teaching digital dj basics, while giving you a basic concept of traditional djing. Exceptional value for the price."
2,"Could have been cute, comes across more as bitter","Bruce Campbell's latest film is a satire of his B movie career and the fans who worship it.It could have been a funny parody but the jokes are not clever, they rely much too heavily on quoting tag lines from Army of Darkness in the hope audience members will shout along. In his attempt to play a bitter B movie star who never got a shot, Campbell is just a bit too convincing and bit too close to home.Add a star if you can quote Army of Darkness from memory but even die-hard Campbell fans will only find modest amusement in this film.The DVD extras are quite nice and add some entertainment value but the main attraction is disappointing."
1,Another Piece of Unfunny Garbage from Bruce Campbell,"I loved Bruce Campbell in the original ""Evil Dead,"" ""Evil Dead II,"" and ""Army of Darkness,"" but the movies he's starred in and now produces and stars in are really sickening. They are low-budget (and Bruce is hardly poor as he's one of the original investors in Renaissance Pictures and owns a HUGE piece of land in Oregon, on which this film was mostly shot), trashy, badly written, unfunny and lacking in good special effects or ideas. In an attempt to make fun of his own past, Campbell has the characters repeat his lines from the ""Evil Dead"" and ""Army of Darkness"" again and again. The acting is dismal and Bruce comes off as his ""Ash"" character every time, only he's older and heftier and less funny each time. I've seen enough and could not even sit through all the way through this groaner."
5,awesome movie !!!!!,"All I can say about Bruce Campbell in My Name is Bruce is,""hail to the king baby""."
3,Okay to watch once,The Movie strove to be a comic parody of the horror film genre. In this respect it was. Unfortunately its as tastless as funny. Cheap B or C movie. I think the Scary Movie series might be better. Not worth $17.99.
4,The worst at it's best?,"For what this movie is (a VERY VERY low budget campy horror film)it's great! Bruce Campbell camps himself! Watch the film, you struggle through a scene or two, but hey, what do you want? Then watch the bonus features. They're a riot!"
4,The Return of the Chin,"Bruce Campbell is back and as usual in great form. First of all if your not a bruce campbell fan or dont enjoy his movies then you probably wont like this one as it is trademark campbell....cheesiness and all. For the rest of us(his fans)we are instore for a treat. Bruce is back with a new movie and his all to familiar one-liners. the story itself is a bit cheesy but what did you expect? I thought it was a fun movie,loved the one-liners,as usual bruce's charm is what carries the movie.i hear they are making a sequel and cant wait to see it. If you love b-movies,bruce campbell or b-movies with bruce campbell in them youll love this movie. Buy,watch,enjoy,repeat."
4,great buy,this bluray movie is great and it shipped fast to my door. i will surely buy more bluray movies.
4,Film for the fans,"Just watched it... certainly not a classic film, but a fun watch if you're a big Bruce Campbell fan like me. Lots of inside jokes from his movies and books and some great extras that show everyone really enjoyed making this film. Multiple roles for Ted Raimi is always a plus. The film is a bit slow with limited action, but still fun. Probably hard to recommend to non-Bruce fans, but I doubt they would be buying it anyways."
2,For Bruce Campbell fans only.,"I enjoyed all the in-jokes (mainily references to Evil Dead) and it was nice to see what ol' Bubba's been up to lately. But the test is, would it be enjoyable to an objective viewer, who would miss many of the gags? No. Also, it won't stand up to repeated watchings, it's just not interesting enough in concept or execution. Also, the monster was lame and compared to, say, Evil Dead II, this puppy ranks too low on the Gore-o-Meter. So I enjoyed it once and will sell my copy now. Rent, don't buy."
3,"It is a very good comedy movie, but not one of the best","If you are a fan of Bruce Campbell movies (the star of evil dead trilogy), or also fan of evil dead trilogy this might be a very good one and recommended for you. Otherwise go to other movies, like Zombieland, which I consider it the best among what are there. Also you could see other reviewer and their favorite movies. If I have to give it a rate from 0 - 10 I will give it 7. If I was not fan of Bruce I will give it 5!"
2,Not what I expected,"Bruce Campbell is one of the most talented actors around always with a comic edge, but this was a let down."
3,Only for Campbell fans,"Great fun for Campbell fans, but rather predictable plot and so-sospecial effects. One liners are funny only if you have the background.Lots of work for Ted Raimi as the shemp."
4,"""Pretty Good Campbell Flick!""","Bruce Campbell directs and stars in this 2007 horror comedy thatco-stars Ted Raimi. Bruce plays himself hired by a teen fan tosave a town from an ancient Chinese Demon. This is prettygood and Bruce is great as usual. This dvd has nice pictureand sound plus neat extras. I recomend this, especially ifyou're a Bruce fan."
2,My Name is Bad,"I bought this along with the action figure. The action figure cost about 15 - 20 times what this movie cost; staring at the figure on my shelf for 1.5 hours provides just as much entertainment value as the dvd.Bruce has some fun at his own expense- but as a director...no. Oh no no no. He should have cut off the hand that held the megaphone into which he yelled ""All quiet on the set, aaaaand, speed!"", and perhaps replaced it with a chainsaw or something else more appropriate to his skill set.Love his acting, hate his directing. Take Bubba Ho Tep and make it even more dull. That's ""My Name is Bruce."" And I kind of like BHT.So, I put this movie next to my 3 ""Evil Dead"" movies, and my BHT movie. I doubt I'll watch it again...but I'm the guy who paid 15 - 20 times the price of a bad movie to get a fairly lame action figure of the guy in the bad movie. Tells you my judgement is perhaps to be questioned."
5,"Good, bad, I'm the one writing the review.","If this is going to be your first Bruce Campbell film, A: Slap yourself, and B: Go watch the Evil Dead movies first. Great story, great action, and you'll never get the Guan-Di song out of your head."
4,Good but lacking...,"Gammie provides a great look at holiness in the Old Testament, but I finished still searching for a specific answer. There are many great ideas presented and some of them deserve much more attention then Gammie awarded them."
1,Osteo Bi-flex Has Changed,"New Osteo Bi-flex formulations do not work for me. My knee pain returns almost immediately. Your photo of the product shows the original product packaging which caused me to order the product. When it arrived, I saw that the product was the new ""advanced"" formulation. I returned it."
3,"Misleading title, but a good book.","The book starts off quite well outlining what to look for when apartment hunting. The author offers a sort of appendix at the end of each chapter outlining resources for some of the major cities: New York, Washington DC, Las Vegas, Chicago, Boston, and sometimes Seattle. She proceeds to go over information re: networking and job hunting. She includes sections on therapy and how to find a therapist, ideas for ""dating yourself"" (a very good section) and a section on dating others. The title is slightly misleading, because this book isn't just about living in a big city -- it's more about living on your own and coping with life everywhere."
4,Hip Hop Brilliance,"Amazing lineup on an amazing record, Tek9 goes from a broad scope of electronica to a mainly hip hop style for this one but doesn't miss a beat. I can't say there's a bad track on this record.Good luck finding it though."
2,Dissapointing,"It had a lot of potential, but unfortunately came up short in many ways. At 172 pages it is painfully short. Considering the plot takes sixty pages to start moving, the story does not have much substance. Early on, it is hard to get a sense of what is going on due to constant switching of plot lines. Most of the plot lines have no back story, so you are not sure who you are reading about. This makes the first half of the book difficult to follow.This book is not worth the asking price. Anyone looking for good cyberpunk would be better off getting Richard K. Morgan's ""Altered Carbon""."
3,The Bigs,"its a fun game for a while, but it gets old pretty fast, completing the rookie challenge is not as difficult as it could have been, but for a arcade style baseball game to play with friends, or online, i would say that it is worth it to pick it up, and overall a fun game play experience."
4,"Bueno, pero le falta algo!","Creo que de todos los baseball que jugue desde el atari este es uno de los mejores, pero definitivamente le falta algo y creo que no esta dentro del juego, falta más en la celebracion de los homerun, en lo que pasa en las graderias, etc."
2,Foggy remake,Huh? No spark here... leaves you to wonder why they bothered to remake the original (which I consider a classic)...
3,Scary???,"I am one of these people that cannot stand horror movies....but this one was not scary at all!! I found the story to flow like the typical teenage horror flick...some of the sequences were unbelievable..Selma Blair's character has this horrendous crash, then seems to be totally fine...I mean this woman's car, flips numerous times, then flies off of a cliff!!! (and into the water) come on people!!! I personally hope that this is one of the last remakes that I see, which were unindating the flim industry throughout 2005. Time to bring new talent to life, with some new stories and such...overall grade D+."
1,umm. the ending made NO sense WHAT so ever!,"Gee well, I went to this movie expecting something stupid, so, I got some popcorn, and started watching it, this movie was by far THE CRAPPIEST remake since War Of The Worlds. The movie stuck to the plot of the John Carpenter classic, but, sadly, the fishermen weren't young perverts running boat parties, and the ending, good God what a dissapointment, the woman waltzed over to the graveyard and kissed the dead dude with leprosy, what? Then out of the blue, she turns into a ghost and dances marily with her husband in her past life, only to dissapate into the fog and go away. Okay, well, the little kid in the fog was stupid, in the first film, he was about eight, and didn't know a thing about fog, now in this un-worthy remake, he says "" the fog wants us"". If only amazon gave negetave stars id give this a negetave 30, dont waste you're hard earned money on this load of crap."
1,"Avoid This ""Fog"" and Go for the Original","Carpenter must be very hard up for money as that would have to be the only reason he would ever let someone remake his classic. Like a number of his films, the originalThe Fogfailed to find an audience until being released on VHS/DVD where it is now considered something of a classic. It had one of the best atmospheric direction jobs I can ever recall. How could anyone think they could improve upon this film is a mystery to me. Steer clear of this fog and go buy or rent Carpenter's original."
2,not as bad as boodeyman but it couldve been way better,"i didnt liek a couple things in this movie like the ending and how they changed the storyline i liekd it better in the original storyline then this 1 and when the girl died and was like all happy and went away i was kinda disappointed. the movie was good in the beginning and middle and the end lost it i thought. they should have waited a little while longer to remake this to this movie was made in 1979-80 and the other remakes that have came out lately were from the early 70's liek the hills have eyes which is comn out soon, texaschainsaw massacre, amityville horror i think,and war of the worlds etc etc etc."
4,Tom Welling,"The film isn't what you'd call a ""masterpiece"" but as a ""die hard"" Tom Welling fan all i can say is that he looks absolutely gorgeous!! That's the truth!!=))"
3,The original is a little better,"I consider the original version to be one of my all time favorites. I think this is a decent remake. It expands on the plot to provide a little more explanation of the curse that is the source of all the upheaval. Comparatively I also think the CGI was a bit overdone. The original had some great, convincing cinematography (especially for its time) and this newer version comes off as a bit fake. Given the choice I'd recommend watching both, but if its a case of either/or, stick with the original."
3,THE FOG WAS THE SCARIEST PART!!,"I mean, come on. This is no comparissin to the original. The original was way better.As you should know, the movie is about a city in Oregon who gets trapped by a huge bank of fog, but little did the towns people know, there are monsters lingering within the fog. So some of the towns people try to escape them and learn about the weird past of one of them.So, it was still good. It wasn't bad. It was ok. I would have been disappointed if I would of went to go see this in theaters. But I didn't. Now if you are a horror fan. You might enjoy this one. But I don't highly recommend on seeing it."
1,Absolutely downright HOOOOORIBLE!!!!!!,"This, by far, is the worst film EVER. Tom Welling's part in this movie is....what? He is a nobody in that movie, along his girlfriend who talks like she has cotton in her mouth.Radio host lady....? She is like....twenty something with a 12 year old boy who is retarted and watches his mother walk in her underwear??? Come on. This is a butcher of the original, which is downright freaky.No meaning to this movie, at all. Things are confusing, absolutely nonesense ending and it leaves you actually angry. Please do not waste your money on this movie.I would have given this a minus FIVE stars."
1,"Beware The Fart!... Uh , I mean The Fog...","Bad...So Bad...So very very bad!, I really don't want to waste any more time on this fetid steaming sewer vapor called The Fog. I cussed all the way through this in the theater. Save precious time and watch the original. Remember to avoid any film by the crappy(Stigmata)Director Rupert Wainright(however you spell it) in the future I know I will!!!."
1,Just awful,"I wasn't expecting much but I was still surprised how bad this movie was. There is really nothing good to say about it. If you like horror and think ""hey, I just want something new to watch"", spare yourself and watch something (anything) that you've already seen. Yuck."
2,Stick with the original...,"Man, talk about bad acting. There wasn't one good performance in this entire film. To be quite honest, I've seen better performances in high school drama class productions.Why John Carpenter had anything to do with this lousy remake is beyond me."
1,Sometimes less is more,"I remember seeing the original iin the theatre 25 years ago and loving it. The subtlty, the eerieness, great Carpenter music and some good scarie moments.I was reluctant to see the remake for theose very reasons because I didnt think they could be topped. I was right! I rented the remake and it was simular but nowhere near as good as the original. The performances were horrible, the dialogue laughabe and the effects rediculous. And then they change a key plot point towards the end of the movie that left me rolling my eyes and scratching my head.I guess the whole reason for remaking this was to get the teen crowd to view this as if it were something new (much like all the other remakes they have been making lately) but my advice to people under 25 is rent the original!"
3,"It was just ""OK""",It was sort of a dissapointment..nothing like the original. Still worth watching though
3,The Fog,"Well this movie was decent. If you really want to see it, then rent it, nothing more its not worth the buy in my opinion. Just an overall decent movie to check out. Some parts were kinda cheesy but some were good. The part where the fog busts out Nick's windows, then about an hour later if shows his truck with windows on it, a movie mistake I just found by not trying to find them lol. And its sort of like the main actors are the only people in the whole city, LOL. There is no civilians or anything, sort of weird if you ask me? Had some decent effects in it. The ending was pretty crazy also.But away from all that, the movie isnt bad, isnt excellent its a decent horror movie to check out. I liked it."
1,Don't waste your time,"The first version was a bit corny but it was still better than this one. NO story, bad acting. Don't even buy this from the bin at Walmart"
1,Hollywood is killing the classics!!!!!,"Why can't they just create something new? Why do they have to recycle old classic movies and add these new crappy actors? Well i guess they'll keep on doing it until people stop buying into their stupid remakes. Next stop The Hills Have Eyes, RIP! Please stop watching, buying and renting these dumb remakes or the next classic to be butchered might be your favorite movie!"
2,Why so Upset?,Simply put - this is a mediocre remake of a mediocre movie. It makes me sick to read so many reviews on this site praising the original movie. The original movie was a box office disaster. John Carpenter spent months in post-production hell just to try and make it work and the majority of us only saw it on network television. If you went to see this movie expecting wonderous filmaking - you are a fool and you need to get a career and a life. If you are an individual who is sick of Hollywood remakes (like many of the reviewers on this site) and you STILL watched this movie - you are an idiot.
4,Fair movie.,"The movie was fair, but there was absolutely nothing in this ""Unrated"" dvd that wasn't in the PG-13 version I saw in the theatre a few months ago."
1,OMG,Watching this movie was like trying to (...)when u r really really drunk. You keep going and going but you never get there. I would say The Fog has whiskey (...). I do not reccomend it.
3,Entertaining...,"...if you go in expecting something bad. I recently watched it, expecting something horrible, due to the word of mouth. but in the end, i found it a bit entertaining. but like i said, thats if you begin to watch it expecting something horrible. dont get your hopes up, what you seen in the trailer is as much as you get"
3,"""Ok Remake!""","Tom Welling, Selma Blair and Maggie Grace starin this 2005 horror remake of John Carpenter's1980 film. A town is haunted by a mysteriousfog with vengeful ghosts on it's 100th birthday.This is ok, but the original is better. This dvdhas nice picture and sound plus neat extras.I still recommend this."
2,"Bad,bad,bad",An island town in Oregon is haunted by the angry spirits of people long murdered by the town founders. Some good images but a story that goes nowhere. Buy it used.
1,Horror-able,This is one of the worst horror movies ever made. I was hoping all the characters were going to die. It made me sleepy.
4,Great Thriller Film with Great Effects!,"After reading the reveiws about how horrible this films was from other reveiwers, I still went and purchased thsi DVD. I sat there watching it from start to finish. As for as my feelings go:I thought this was a very good film. Not great, not fantastic but not the ""peice of crap"", everyone made it out to seem. Yes it is a remake. Seems a bit on the lower budget side but it is in no way liek a mad for TV movie! This film has it all for those looking for a good ghost story GREAT CG and interesting make up effects. This film also has its share of ""scare"" moments. Nothing too gorey and not a blood fest! Great job! Definetly recommend if your looking for a lite scary movie!As for Tom Welling he did a decent job, did not remind me at all of Clark Kent from Smallville good job!"
2,Average Beginning and Middle...Then Just A Lousy Ending,"All right in the first hour of this movie I was bored yes but I didn't think on baring my critical fangs yet for the movie was average at least for a horror film. The characters were boring nonetheless and really did not interest me. The storyline itself behind the Fog was pretty good though but it could not save the ending of this film, which was really lousy and to me made hardly any sense.Take my advice, and many others I assume will say the same thing- get the older version. The older version is way better and so is the ending. The actors are even better in the older version. This remake is poor compared to the old one so please do not think the old version is as bad as the remake because it isn't- it is a whole lot better trust me."
2,Was the original better? Hope so...,"Tom Welling and Maggie Grace did the best they could, but the story just isn't that interesting and it is a very predictable and familiar tale of revenge from people who were wrongly killed by greedy folks in the past."
1,Skip this one......... and get the Original,"Poor film. Waste of time. John Carpernter's original with Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, her mom Janet Leigh, Hal Holbrook and others was a pretty good atmospheric horror flick. Well done with a good cast and good production values. If tempted by this one, get the other. You'll be glad you did."
3,pretty good,This movie was ok. It is not as good as the original but it was pretty good. It is not as bad as every one said it was. Hope this helps someone.
5,"""A Worthy Remake""","Despite what critics and fans have said about ""The Fog"", this film is a great remake of a classic horror film. It isn't Oscar material, but what scary movie is. It is meant to be fun and campy and I actually enoyed it. I will also admit I am a huge fan of Tom Welling, and there is a great scene in the film where he takes his shirt off: that is worth the price of the movie.The film basically follows the same plot as the original in which a huge fog bank descends upon Antonio Bay and all hell breaks loose. Lots of surprise elements are included, and there were many times I jumped while watching it.The DVD has some great bonuses, including commentary by the director, deleted scenes, and a great documentary on remaking a classic.When the new version of ""The Fog"" came out in 2006 it debut at #1 at the boxoffice, eventually accumulating a gross of over 26 million dollars: someone liked it!Sit back, make some popcorn and enjoy a great, scary film."
3,It's Ok,I saw this when it was in theaters years ago and i loved it. but now that i'm older and i watch it now it doesnt seem to do anything for me. it's ok i mean there is nothing really wrong with it. i guess now i wishing that the movie was more scary. but as a fan of tom welling's i have it and tom did good job in this nothing special but it was good. and i have seen the orignal and i perfer this one to that but still nothing special just ok.
2,Could have been better,"The original was one of the first horror movies I ever saw, if not my first. So it is still near and dear to my heart. With that being said, I felt compelled to check out this newer version of the old classic. Being a TV fan, I was quite fond of the cast, Tom Whelling, Maggie Grace, and Selma Blair. I also like how they tell a more detailed backstory to set up exactly why they are being attacked by the fog. Good flashbacks and storytelling, but the scares were too few are far between. I also did not care for the ending, kind of lost me somewhere. Don't want to get specific about it, if you do decide to rent or buy this DVD you can draw your own conclusion. All in all it was a decent flick, not one I care to own for my collection, but worthy of a friday night rental when everything else is rented out."
1,its too bad this film was made,"This movie was terrible. At no point is it scary. The acting is stale, the visual effects are cheesy, and the changes to the plot are completely unneccesary. The movie made me laugh, but even making fun of it does not make it enjoyable enough to be worth watching.The original Fog is a great movie."
1,Fog-get About It!,"Made for TV caliber stinker remake of a for-its-time decent horror movie. Acting is bad with TV actors. The dialogue is bad to corny at best. The story is completely unbelievable. Continuity was all over the place. This was just one of those plain old bad movies on cable that you somehow find yourself in front of after stumbling in late on a Saturday night.I remember the original as being a bit more entertaining, but that was like 25 years ago (the original The Fog was actually the first movie that I saw on cable TV in like 1980). So if you're in the mood for a Foggy evening, rent the original. There's no way it couldn't be better than this amateurish remake.More than enough said."
2,Remake of The Fog is dead in the water,"Pun intended. Why is it that every classic horror remake is made with people that weren't even alive when the original came out? Horror is not just for teenagers. But every horror movie coming out lately is about some 20-something or God forbid, a 30-something. I guess people beyond that just don't scare easily. I know you couldn't have got a pulse on me during this one.It's not believable that the male lead in the film would be a fisherman. Sorry, not buying it. And how do you suppose Adrienne Barbeau feels to have Selma Blair play her character? Blair doesn't look old enough to have a son the age of the one in the movie either.All I can say is, ug."
2,A Tragic case of all style . . .,"I saw the original. What took me back some is the fact that the plot of why the ghosts are in the island town is totally unrelated from one another. Plus, I really didn't like the whole random choosing of the victums.I could see how they had watched the original and said, ""we can do this much better given the technology we have now.""But did they really have to sacrifice story.The characters even have little differences but not many. They are all, collectively, your typical scared townies that don't know what's going on and just wander around when it comes to solving it. The style of the film was executed perfectly, though. I can never get enough of the images. But there just needs to be mory story.plus, it's just too short when it comes right down to it.Final Verdict: The plot gets lost in the fog.But, hey, that's just my perspective. You might like it better than I did."
1,Painful.....,Take all the spooky dread and atmosphere of the original....the beautiful but creepy music.....the seriously menacing dark and wet hook wielding dead lepers....surgically remove all that and insert pretty cookie cutter faces and a script as stiff as a board. The arrogance of this director to attempt to remake a true American horror classic and then vomit this horrid piece of garbage onto film. The director even had the nerve to make fun of Tom Atkins skin in an interview. I'm sick about this film. I'm gonna take a nap....hopefully when i wake it will all have been a bad tasteless dream. Wake up Carpenter.....it's not about money. Save us.
3,GRATE!,"My favorite horror movies was those old ones like ( PROM NIGHT) (DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT) (CARRY) (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) and so on. If you love those, then you have to see this one. I get to admit that I had't seen the 80s one but I am dying to, so to speak! this is what ghost storys are all about.I love how they made the spirits and the ending wes grate too. (Selma Blair) wes good but I would like to have seen "" more of her "". if I played her son I would of went down on her and f her brans out... god dammit she so hot!"
1,Fogged Up,This Movie was one of the biggest diasters I have ever seen.The only thing fogged up in this movie were the directors glasses and the cameramans lenses.DONT BUY IT!!!
2,Just don't expect much.,"Well, i was looking forward to seeing this remake, with all the new technology for special effects and such, i thought it would be good. I was quite disappointed with the results. Corny acting, boring dialog, random jumps, it just wasn't a movie you could really get into, let alone an ending that leaves you scratching your head. If you really must see it, do yourself a favor and rent the original as well."
2,"Not bad, not great","Watched The Fog last night. It was John Carpenter remaking his own movie for todays audience. I hadn't seen the old one in so long I can't remember much about it except the basic plot premice of curse, fog, ghosts, ship, scream, kill, scream. The new one is about the same if you go by my description of my memory of the first one. Selma Blair is just a really bad actress. She is monotone and has no charisma and delivers her lines like she is zonked on prozac or something. The Smallville guy is the main hero and he isn't very good either. The rest of the cast is pretty blah too. This is a straight forward ghost story, no gore and little effects. In some ways that is refreshing cause I don't think a horror movie has to be all blood and guts and shock. But this movie just isn't that great. Its worth watching but not great... not sure its really good either though. Rent it before you think about buying."
1,Heroes of horrible strategy,This game is awful. Don't buy at all. Horrible strategy gameplay. The only redeeming quality is the realistic time cap.
3,You sir are no Might & Magic....,"If any of you remember the Might & Magic game from the Sega Genesis, you'd certainly hope this game was similiar. Well sorry to tell you, it's nothing like that particular game, nor like Warriors of M&M released on the PS2.This, as another reviewer had pointed out is King's Bounty from the Sega system; with better graphics. The maps are identical, villians the same. Not one part of this game was upgraded for the PS2. I sit and wonder why? It was a decent game that kept me entertained...but with the power of the PS2 you'd think they'd add some bells and whistles. This certainly was not a game that was soooo great it had to have been released on the PS2.Buy the game if you liked Kings Bounty (I did like the game and thus the only reason I gave it 3 stars) but don't buy this if your looking for a great PS2 game. Save your money for Metal Gear."
1,This Game = Poo,"The title of the section says it all. I thought this game would be an RPG and it ended up being some game equivilent to Britney's Dance Beat (which is the worst game ever). You ride around on a horse while you recruit farmers and zombies to recieve a staff. You control these characters, which die in 2 seconds, against innumerable amounts of other farmers and zombies. You pick up money in boxes and then get it taken away because your peasants revolted. You then die and go back to where you started...To do what??? Recruit more farmers!. Yahoo! Good Fun! Too bad i couldnt choose to put 0 stars on this review, because if i could....i rate this a negative 5 so that anyone who bought or created this game would cry at their horrible purchase and product. I hate this game with an aggresive passion. :("
1,"Could have been a great game, but isn't","Well, first off let me say I loved the PC versions of Heroes. This is what I hoped for in the PS2 version. I was very unhappy with this game. The graphics are pretty, but it limits you to the troop types and quantity your hero can round up. Also, as mentioned in another review the only resource is gold, so you can't use a market place to make your life easier. Combat is very well done with the exception of dead troops getting a counter attack. I also like that you can pull troops from a garrison. However don't go over your control limits of troops as they will go insane and kill off the rest of your troops. I stopped playing it after 2 attemps to have fun. 3DO if you are reading, you should have RENAMED this title so as not to confuse it with a great game series. Borrow a friends copy before wasting ...."
3,Heroes of Might and Magic,"This is a really good series for the PC, but this crossover to the PS2 doesn't really do it justice. Still enjoyable, just not as much."
3,It's still a good game.,"OK, if you are going to compare it with the PC version you are going to be very disappointed. If you see this game as a new game, a totally different game, nothing to do with the PC version then you might like it a lot.By the way, also very addictive."
3,I should be more careful.,"OK, the item is exactly as described. That said, I didn't realize just how small 9mm is. My error, but unless you're making some kind of jewelry, these things are useless. I'll be more careful in the future."
4,Too small for larger keys,"There is nothing wrong with the quality of these rings, but they are too small to be slipped on larger keys (like car keys, key fobs) without bending out of shape. Another reviewer mentions that these do not have the small kink larger rings have to keep them from catching fabric, but the ones I received do have a kink.I recommend key rings that are at least 1/2 inch for the larger keys. For other uses these rings should be fine."
3,Good rings,"Cheap, but exactly as described. Shipping took long time but worth the wait. I was expecting it to be a little bit more thicker and maybe slightly larger. I use these pieces to make zipper pulls for paracord projects among other keychain pieces to attache to a larger split ring."
5,Great - Perfect Size For EDC Knives & Flashlights,I bought these to put on my EDC knives and flashlights. These split rings are the perfect size for attaching a lanyard.Buy with confidence.
1,High Heat 2002-The Pitts,"High Heat 2002, Where so i begin...the graphics where the worst i've ever seen in a baseball game, the audiance looked like dots of color and the stadiums where worst. The players look terrible and don't have there own stances. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this game. the pitchers are terrible and don't have there own unigue wind ups. the seasons are ok because they have top prospects (like the yankees mick johnson, Randy Kesiler, Ted Lilly..etc) but the trading is terrible, u can only trade one player for another no multi-player deals, not to mention it's to hard to get a good play, and some people like Ken Grifffey JR u can get for someone like Scott Rolen. the game play is ok but the lack of good graphics make it less exciting. All in all this is one of the worst baseball games i've ever played."
5,Physical Education Teacher...what is H.A.'s profession,"Just out of curiosity, I would like to know the back ground on the person who reviewed this book named H.A. It is obvious that he or she did not have a background in education or youth developement. Having worked with over thousands of students I can safely say that H.A. doesn't have a clue on what kids can really understand. If it is over your head then you have no business trying to teach it to the kids. Feel free to reply or email.."
5,A heart-warming read.,"Lonely Heart is truly one the best books I've picked up in a long time. I laughed, cried, and throughout the book, was totally enchanted. Karin Story is a gifted author whose books I will definitely seek out in the future."
5,Delivered as expected,"Package came timely and in new condition. Reliable supplier. Also, JOICO is an excellent hair product for young males looking to style their hair with ease and have the option of washing it off quickly later in the day. It has long lasting power too."
4,Keep looking good all day,I like the fact that your hair is still the same way it looked when you put the gel on at 7am and look at it at 9pm. I also like the fact that it doesn't flake or give that look of dandruff....highly recommend
3,Not to shabby,"The product is decent, its an everyday molding clay. Its a fair price and the bottle is little but don't let its size fool you, it lasts a very long time! The only warning I would give is ""never use any amount over the size of a dime"" or your hair will look clumpy, nasty, dirty and it wont go away until you wash your hair again."
5,worth the money!!!!,"I loved this book. Blind Run was quick and exciting! Ethan, my favorite, is definatly a powerful character. I do not want to give too much of the book away exept to say it is really good."
2,More confusing than gripping....,"While this book had some good scenes, I found much of it to be more confusing than exciting. I never quite got into the characters, and thought some of their actions/reactions inexplicable. The plot seemed borrowed from a fifties movie. It's not a bad book, just not great. It wasn't what I expected from reading the other reviews. Glad I bought a used copy!"
2,Don't waste your money,"This novel is very cliche and half baked. The plot contains more oxymorons than I've ever read. There are numerous unbelieveable scenes and happenings. One such example is that of a road in the dessert that is hidden (in the DESSERT), onto which a car turns; once that car turns, the car following loses track of them (in the DESSERT). We're talking wide open spaces here for endless miles. How is it possible to lose track of something that can't hide? There's also an instance when it is noted that it wouldn't be wise for the main characters to go to a place owned by her parents as that's the first place where the pursuers are bound to look. In the next few paragraphs they describe their destination which is, ofcourse, owned in part by her parents. Helloooooooo!I am angry at myself for paying valuable money for this novel and will return it first thing tomorrow."
3,Entertaining but ordinary,"Ethan Decker, an agent for a secretive government agency is expecting to be killed after retiring from the agency. He is, therefore, surprised when a fellow agent shows up with two children for his safe keeping. The children were taken off a secret island where they were involved in some kind of experiment. When the agent is killed, it is left up to Ethan Decker to find out where the children are from and why they were being held on the island.BLIND RUN is an entertaining debut novel that is remarkably ordinary and forgettable. The characters never quite manage to be sympathetic whole creations. Stereotypes abound. The pacing is quite fast as a thriller should be and the length supports the pedestrian plot. A good job for a debut novel but it failed to draw my attention to the author enough to buy and read her next book."
5,RUN get a copy of Blind Run!,"A wonderful suspense story! In the first chapter, we meet an agent who retired from life five years ago when his son was killed. A former co-agent drops two children at his trailer, and he finds her down the road, killed. The rest of the book he's running with the children from the killers, and his own past, trying to piece together what's happening. You will not want to put down this book!!"
3,The first four tracks are rare broadcasts!,"3-CD set from Portugal of which the first four songs are rare radio transcripts that Patsy had performed in autumn 1961 for the marine corps. The majority of this collection features her early Four-Star Records' material, without much effort taken in regards to sound quality or continuity; however, to hear four priceless broadcasts of her later Decca material unavailable anywhere else makes this collection a must!"
2,Poorly constructed forms,"Journaling your food and exercise is very important if you are serious about your fitness, however, this book has the worst forms for doing this that I've seen. Unless you are a proficient at micro-sized handwriting, the pages will look like a mess in no time. The introduction information is ok, but not essential to the function of a journal. It was a good idea to make it spiral bound, but this can't save it from the poor form designs. You'd be better off buying a good pad of grid paper and making your own forms."
2,Complicated,I found this journal to be very complicated and full of information that I did not need. I wanted something simple to track my progress and this is not it.
3,Hair-raising,I found this book very well written with lots of twists and turns. Very suspenseful. I found that after the first few chapters the book just flew by and I couldn't put it down. Bravo Mr. Prichard. A very good work for the first time author.
4,Awesome CT Hardcore,"My friend from Connecticut first showed me this band earlier this year. And I loved this CD ever since. Life In Your Way combines a familiar hardcore sound that falls somewhere between Shai Hulud, Thursday, and Hopesfall. The only reason I give this CD 4 stars is because while it is a great record, it's nothing new. Many people have done this kind of music/album before but Life In Your Way does it awesome. Only 9 songs but all are amazing. Best song - Fall"
2,Nuclear Winter....,"I along with many experts do not agree that ""nuclear winter"" is a reason not to prepare for a ""limited exchange"" or terrorist attack. Nuclear winter may occur in the event of full scale nuclear war, where EVERY warhead on the planet is set off. Many people including our government quit preparing to survive a nuclear event because they were wrongly convinced they could not survive the ""winter"" anyway. How short sighted. There is a very good book titled Nuclear War Survival Skills, that in this day and age should be required reading by every head of household."
4,"Speaking Out for ""Reaching Out""","Nikki and her uncle have written some good songs about our times and problems and have given us a way to set them straight. I have a good time singing along with ""Draw The Line"" also. I feel that these songs will appeal to a wide variety of people."
4,A Classic Road Movie,"If you enjoy road movies, such as Fellini's La Strada or Leningrad Cowboys Go America, then be sure to see this one. It's a real travelogue, that takes you through Brazil's back roads and small rural villages. This travelling circus troope has to venture ever farther into the vast country's hinterlands to escape from its most deadly enemy.And what is that? The tv! Where they see the dreaded tv antennas, they know it's time to move on. So they do.This is a very touching film about the trials and tribulations of being a travelling performer--a tough life, but one that they would never give up. I can't imagine any of these people holding down an ordinary job. So naturally, I came to empathize with them to a surprising degree. By the end, they all seemed like old friends of mine."
5,A researcher's dream,This is one of those rare books which explores both the micro and macro of the period. It discusses the major historical events of the time in great detail. But it also paints a picture of everyday life of the common man/woman. The information is abundant and accompanied with vivid graphical representations which aid in learning about this place and time in history.
4,Cute and Creative shirt,This is a very cute t-shirt. It comes with different parts of the face and allows you to stick it anywhere on the face part of the t-shirt. Very creative.
5,Incredibly funny movie,"I just finished watching it and I can't really think straight, I've been laughing so deleriously hard the whole time. :) It has some tricky subtitle reading in some spots (They're always white, but oftentimes the background is white too), but all in all a damn funny movie."
5,This Show Was A Mixture of Comedic Genius & Pure Talent,This is one of the funniest shows ever made for ages 13-18. The comedy was very quick and didn't treat kids like they were stupid like so many shows today do. Each episode had a theme to it like being the new kid at school or dealing with break ups and would eventually lead to a song in which the actors would sing while doing incredibly complicated dances that required a lot of training. I really hope this show is released on DVD not just for the comedy but for the message as well.
4,Hope it's released soon!!,"I remember watching this show alot when I was younger. In a way I kind of viewed it as a kid version of SNL...with the sketch comedy and whatnot. Alot of my memories of the show are vague and everytime I've mentioned it to someone they think I'm talking about ""All That"" :( But it was definitely an awesome show and I can't wait to watch it again!! Definitely looking forward to this release along with hopefully more releases from Nickelodeon's 90's era!!"
5,You don't have to have been a kid,"My husband, daughter and I all loved watching 'Roundhouse'. Just last night she was reminiscing with friends and wishing this was on dvd. It was funny on several levels, the dancing was great and the music was good. It was a clean, fun show.I am NOT telling her - this is going to be a gift."
5,The Last Roman,"Syagrius, the last Roman commander in the West, makes an appearance in this book. He accepts the aid of Cormac Mac Art and Wulfhere the Skull-Splitter in defending Sossions against Clovis. Tied in with the historical fact of Syagrius' defeat in 486, which ended Roman control of southern Gaul, and marked the end of his 10-year holdout after the fall of Rome, this final work in the series begun by Robert E. Howard ends Thulsa Doom's reign of terror as Cormac's arch-foe. With the lovely Samire at his side, the heroes do battle with Hengist, the Danish king and mortal enemy of Wulfhere, before reaching doomed Sossions. Andrew Offut also uses the novel to advance theories on the origins of the Irish race, tying in the Tulath de Danu, with their moonbow emblem, with Greek Diana, who also is identified with the crescent Moon. A good, light read, for those who like historical settings for swords & sorcery adventures. -Lloyd A. Conway"
5,What a terrific book!,"I have to admit I was skeptical at first when I ordered this book...However, when I received it...I was thrilled with all the photos of Marilyn I had never seen before and it sparked my interest in collecting Marilyn memorabillia. Up 'til now, I have only collected books about her and miss her dearly every day of my life. The collection of magazine covers is astonishing. I know she was/is the most photographed woman who's ever lived (although Princess Diana is probably a close rival,) and I knew she modeled for several years. But I had never seen all those pictures. The only bad thing about it s the pics make me miss her all the more!"
4,The First Edition is 100% Better!,"This is a great book, and for the price, you can't go wrong, but the genuine article is the first edition from 1999. Much nicer covers, beautiful color prints. If you only buy one, the first edition is a MUST for any Marilyn Monroe fan!"
2,clarity please,"When the title specifies a ""Hemp Blend"" and the product details says 100% cotton, how so you reakon a customer can make sense of this?"
1,Quite awful,"I like Bill Murray a lot, wish him well, and hope he can eventually transition to serious acting roles. But in this ludicrous adaptation of a substantive novel, he simply cannot pull it off. That famous smirk is always there, right below the surface. I expected him to break into an SNL skit at any moment, destroying any pretense of real drama. Go see Groundhog Day instead."
1,"Poor Acting, Poor Editing","First off, I like Bill Murray. Unfortunately he simply doesn't have the acting talent to play this role. He tries, but he does not have the dramatic or emotional depth required of the role. One would be better off reading the book."
1,"Trite story, wooden acting. A waste of time.","Bill Murray plays Bill Murray. He has the same dead-pan, expressionless delivery he often has. He manifests the same childish humor here as in Saturday Night Live. So what if he sits on top of a snow topped mountain? There is no dialog that can demonstrate he did more than sleep there. There is not an ounce of real Buddhism here. And when the Buddhist monk says, ""The path to salvation is narrow and difficult, like walking the razor's edge,"" I say ""What salvation?"" Buddhism is not about salvation, it is about escaping sorrow by renunciation and following the 8 fold path. I question the taste and knowledge of the reviewers who gave this show 5 stars. I got this movie because of the rave reviews here and felt betrayed."
1,One of the All Time Worst!,"What a disappointment after reading so many GOOD reviews of this film....and even more so after LOVING the Maugham novel on which it is woefully adapted. Poor Bill Murray: he obviously (as a co-writer and star of the film) loved the book, too, but ended up in one of the biggest turkeys of all time. It is especially hard to try and get past his comic persona and any fan of the novel will be left scratching his head wondering how this particular version ever came to be. The supporting cast is weak, with the exception of Theresa Russell who does a great job with her limited role and a terrible wig. I haven't seen the Tyrone Power version yet, but something tells me I should just stick with the book."
4,"Another sleeper, apparently NOT undiscovered...","GREAT movie! Has kept me thinking about it since it was released in video MANY years ago. This is the movie that entrapped Bill Murray into all those other ""comedy"" flicks the studio wanted him to do... as he REALLY wanted to make this film above all others. I only wish it was in DVD."
2,Much different....,"If you first read Maugham's novel and wanted to see a ""movie version"" of that novel, I believe that you, as I was, will be sorely disappointed by this movie. Way too many important parts passed over and some semi-minor parts of the book are glamorized. On the other hand, if I had never read the book, I probably would have really enjoyed this movie a lot more, and probably would have given it 4 or 5 stars.I just placed an order for the 1940's movie version of the book, which, from what I've heard from other reviewers, is much truer to Maugham's book."
5,The Razor's Edge: art made movie.,"It is a treasure as far as movies and art is concern.J.Botto Bellaire, TX"
3,OK adaptation,"This movie was poorly reviewed by critics when it came out in 1984, and I had little interest to see it until I recently read the novel by W. Somerset Maugham. Bill Murray plays Larry, a young man who fights in WWI and comes back a changed man. Following the war, he begins a spiritual quest for the meaning of life, which leads him to Eurpoe and Asia. He later meets up again with some of his American friends in Paris, where the film's denouement takes place.It's always a pretty interesting movie; however, Murray is severely miscast. In the book, Larry is a very genial and sincere guy, but Murray plays him as a bit of a clown. His performance makes the film too erratic in tone. Fans of the novel will also likely be disappointed by several changes - the author is not present in the film and Elliot's role is greatly diminished. Overall, fans of Murray and the novel are likely to be let down."
1,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed with this film. Bill Murray is not the right actor for the part, to begin with. He is too heavy-handed. Also the script departs from the novel in ways that indicate that the writer(s) missed the whole point of many incidents. The implied sex scene, for instance, does NOT take place, and the fact that it does not is important in the development of the characters. The re-writing of the novel for this film unfortunately destroys all the nuances of character and plot."
2,Murray fan seriously disappointed,"This is one of the most wonderful stories, and the original movie with Tyronne Power was excellent. I was excited to see this remake because I'm a Murray fan. However, Murray comes off as a smirking smart mouth instead of the sensitive man the role requires. I gave it two stars because the story is so good, and there are some scenes with provocative interpretations somewhat different from the original."
5,Must Have,"This book should be the textbook for free thinking entrepreneurs the world over. Especially now, when corporate and small business growth has become stagnant. Just when it seems we have all our oars in the water pulling in different directions Mad Dogs brings you to a different place, a place full of promise, fresh ideas, and innovation. The clarity in which it is written, leads you to intellectual stimulation and then inevitably to the execution of true growth in yourself, community and your own corporate success . Zades and Stephens have written a true gem. Buy this book before corporate America catches on."
1,The problem with it,I order the complete superman collection and it had a scratch thru the the movie in the clooectin and u can tell it was from when it was made and the replacement was the same way
3,Thanks for the memories,Rest in peace superman...soar high through the clouds too peace. You will be missed.
4,A Great Deal for Collectors.,"I think that the Superman Collection was a long overdue addition to the DVD format. I feel that this collection is a great deal for those like myself who really enjoy collecting DVD's.This kind of packaging makes getting the entire collection of a certain series easy and ofcourse makes it nicer for a collection to have a box set. I only hope that they can do the same with the Batman Movies, which would make a very collectable box set aswell."
2,What's so Super!,Packaging is terrible! DVD cases cheaply constructed and the collection box is very flimsy...so far the movies are good productions!
4,"Great DVD's, Good presentation","I like Very much superman, and this box set is great, i recomended very much. The only problem is the Superman IV DVD. The other 3 comming with all languages and all subs, but de 4 didn't come with spanish subs. But still great."
4,nunca pueden faltar en casa estas películas,"Puede que no sean las más caras de la historia, ni las de mejor taquilla, pero con seguridad siempre serán de las mejores de Héroes."
4,"Excellent 1&2, Poor 3&4","Superman 1 & 2 are the best, the other two just dont make the cut. The problem is not at all that Superman 3 & 4 didnt get the digital treatment, but these two movies are poorly rendered and performed. Maybe just Superman III makes up a bit cause Christoper Reeve excellent performance when doing the evil & depressed Superman. From there, everything is so pointless. Advise for my mexican & Latin american comrades: Not every movie in this set has spanish subtitles.This set is worth to have for any Superman fanatic, but if you like it only ocassionaly I recommend only the first two movies."
5,What a Superman Collection!!!!,I love this collection. This is might be the best movie I ever seen. I'll buy the smallville collection too when the season 5 hits on dvd. I will even buy the The New Adventure of Superman on dvd. Because I am a fan of Superman since I was still a kid.
3,Good Collection of Films,"The Complete Superman Collection on DVD is a mixed blessing. We finally get the Superman movies on DVD. However, only the first film was given royal treatment. Superman I has new scenes, 5.1 soundtrack, loads of extra's and widescreen presentation. Superman II, III and IV are all in widescreen, but they lack 5.1 sound or extra's.Each film has their own charm to it, but each film lost a little quality. However, III and IV are not as bad as you may remember. Despite bad special effects and obvious postproduction cutting, Superman IV has many nice moments.If you are a Superman fan as I am, this is the collection to own. Casual viewers may want to stick with Superman I."
4,A new set should be released with aspect ratios of 1.85:1,"This collection of the four Superman movies is pretty good overall. Some people though are complaining that the DVDs do not offer full screen formats. Although it is true that you do see more of the film when watching a widescreen version, I can sort of understand why some people prefer full screen. Those who just own a portable DVD player have more have a problem with this widescreen and full screen issue because the screen is usually very small. I've noticed that many widescreen movies that come with aspect ratios of 1:85:1 usually give the viewer the choice between widescreen and full screen. DVDs with aspect ratios of 2:35:1 don't seem to if your watching them on a fairly small portable DVD player. The movie is stretched, but not so far that the black bars are completely gone. Since most movies on DVD are now being shown with the 1:85:1 aspect ratio, you'd think the Superman films would be included. Maybe there are future plans for this."
3,Cuidado los compradores de habla hispana:,"A la hora de comprar The Superman DVD Collection hay que considerar también esto: por más que sea la más mala de la saga, Superman IV: The quest for peace NO INCLUYE SUBTÍTULOS EN ESPAÑOL, las otras tres películas sí lo tienen."
1,DEFFECTIVE PRODUCT,"3 OUT OF THE 4 CD'S CAME WITH DEFFECTS. THEY FREEZ, THE AUDIO IS NOT SYNCRONIZED WITH THE VIDEO. I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE A REPLACEMENT."
3,great for the right investor,"This book was excellent if you plan on investing in a small company with hopes of it becoming a big one over a time period of months. It is not helpful for the day trader, looking for day trading strategies."
3,Outlines all the basics,Outlines all the basics of what you need to watch out for in trading/investing in penny stocks. Trading at these low levels is quite different than trading NYSE securities.
5,Nick and C.J. get Robotech right,"First of all, as everybody knows, it is Roy Folker, not Roy Hunter. My brother and I used to watch the original Robotech every morning. My brother used to drag me out of bed (as a seven year old, I hated this) to watch this weird but wonderful show. I learned to appreciate it on a higher level years later when we were able to buy some of the original volumes on VHS. The original cast, including Rick, Roy, Claudia, Lisa, Max, Captain Gloval, etc. was far superior to the later shows, featuring whacked-out, incoherent, stupid plots with worthless casts of aliens and other assorted deadbeats. Any help on finding the complete collection of episodes on either VHS or DVD would be much appreciated."
5,Solutions for a Crisis-free world,"As we are still desperately struggling with the global economic crisis, this book- like all other Toffler books - may give us invaluable perspective on the reasons of the crisis and solutions for a crisis-free world.Toffler believed that the existing institutions, politics, system are all anachronistic and are therefore incapable for the needs of the people. This simple yet rich idea explains why we are facing structural problems like unemployment, increasingly unbalanced distribution of the wealth, gender & immigrant issues, poverty, etc.Solutions to these crucial & chronic problems cannot be as simple as economic tricks like tax or interest increases/decreases, etc. Today's society needs to welcome/appreciate the variety within and should try capitalize on this variety. This involves a rich-democracy that welcomes and promotes all types of people with differing needs, a revised education system and a totally different concept of working."
2,Excellent Service,"After I ordered the CD, I felt like Ralphie, from ""A Christmas Story,"" when he was waiting for his Red Rider Decoder Ring. It arrived just three days after the order was placed, and even though used, was in excellent condition. I immediately ripped it to my phone so I could listen to it on the way to work.The recording itself, however, left much to be desired. The Millennium Choir must have been high school students gathered for the recording. I also prefer my Alfred Burt ""A Cappella,"" but oh well. If you MUST have something by Alfred Burt, this might work. Otherwise, you would be better off to keep looking."
1,Bad Packaging,"These chairs were delivered in such a damaged condition, it looked like they had been dragged behind the delivery truck. The cardboard packaging was torn and dented and had been re-taped several times, and the chairs themselves were broken. The meager amount of styrofoam protection was broken to bits inside the box. We sent them back, reporting the sorry condition, and asked for replacements. When the replacements arrived, the boxes were in no better condition, and we refused delivery without even opening them (we could see through an open seam in one box that one of the chairs inside was broken). It is unfortunate that the manufacturer would waste perfectly good merchandise by not providing adequate packaging."
5,"Yes, I still use a palm pilot!","If you use a palm pilot you'll probably need extra pens. For some reason, over time the pens loosen up in the holder and fall out, which mine did. So, I purchased these.Since you can do so much more with a palm pilot, like actually writing on your touch pad, I haven't converted to using my phone for my handishopper. I'll continue to use my phone as a phone until I can hand-write on the touch pad; then I'll make the switch. Until then I need extra pens for my Palm III!The item was shipped quickly and I was happy with the transaction."
5,An Egg-cellent Little Reader!!,"I bought this book (along with two other titles ""Do Zebras Have Spots?"" and ""Do Cows Bark?"") for my daughter when she was four. The first dozen times I read it to her, but after that, she read them to me! She loved the pictures and the questions, but I think she loved the interaction she had with me whilst reading them.""Are eggs square, Momma?""""Yes!""(flip the page)""Oh, Momma, eggs aren't square! They're oval!""She's seven now, and these are still some of her favorite books ever.The sentences are short and simple. The pictures (to include the see-through pages and the cut-outs) were perfect and inviting. And at the end of each book, there is a two-page spread that recaps everything they learned in the book.I highly recommend this to all parents of little kids!"
2,Not impressed,"If your looking for sparkle and diamond cut cz's this is not the necklace for you. It has no shine, is very dull. I purchased this for my daughter because of the other reviews but you don't have to. I would never say ""Oh, that is so beautiful"" Very disappointed plus the chain came all in a great big knot which took me over an hour to undo. Pass on this piece of jewelry."
3,"The Ramones are ""turning Japaneese"" (I really think so!)","Japan's answer to the Ramones! Immagine a more tunefull Yoko Ono backed by Johny, Dee Dee & Tommy and you have the Banana Erectors. Best moment: a cover of the B Girls ""fun at the beach""."
4,From what i've listened to its worth it.,only heard a few songs but if theyre anything to go by then this is sorta cool
3,extra credit Stotan review,"I thought Stotan was a little bit boring in the beginning, but the more I read the more interesting it was. The book had a few interesting and suspenseful parts. The book had some funny parts also. Stotan was about a group of five friends on the swimming team, encountering many common and uncommon problems. The more you got to know the characters the better the book got. There were some good lessons in the book. It taught you that no matter how bad you think your problems are there is probably someone out there with worse problems, and that you should not put off doing things with your friends, because they may not be there tomorrow.The book was enjoyable and was fun to read in some parts. Overall, I didn't really care for the book but other readers may enjoy reading Stotan, and it did have some good lessons for teenagers."
5,Stotan Swimming,I am a high school English teacher and read this to my class of struggling readers. They liked this less than Deadline ... but I liked this book. Not quite as emotionally gripping as deadline ... but great especially if you are into swimming
2,Stotan Review,"Stotan was a book about four friends, Nortie,Walker,Lion and Jeff. Throughout this book they go through many hardships that a lot of teens today go through. The four friends were on a swim team together and for their season conditioning, their coach created ""Stotan Week."" They went through some really tough times during stotan week, but that would only prepare for the other hard times to follow!!!"
3,it was an okay book,"this book takes you into the mind of walker, a high school swim team captian, and his troubles. this book will oull you some of the time, but you'll find your self waiting for a good part."
4,Breaks down traditional barriers of young adult literature,"Although this is definitely a novel that will appeal more to a male audience, I was impressed with the storyline that held me captive until I was finished with it. This novel is helping to break the ground into re-defining young adult literature. The characters are believable and their situations real. Any adolescent could read this book and find a connection with one of the characters."
3,Reality Stretch,"The book `Stotan' starts off with a swimming team practicing to become Stotans or a cross Stoic and a Spartan. There is a wild love twist between the main character, Walker, Deveene, and Walker's best girl friend Elaine (girl friend as in a friend who is a girl). The main theme of the book to me and many others I know is that you can't always fight what you up against but you just have to go with the flow.When I read the book 'Stotan' it felt pretty blah I mean other than telling people on how to live his or her life there is nothing exciting about the book. One of the reasons I disliked the book is that it just combines way to many issues, conflicts, and themes into on tiny 183 paged book. The book takes reality and stretches it a little to far for my taste, so that is why I only give the book a total of three stars."
1,A Very Handy Shelve for Storage,"This storage unit is neither Oak or Hand Crafted. It is made of particle board covered by vinyl made to simulate Oak or whatever you wish. If they had made the cover out of the New York Times Funny Papers at least that would have been interesting. A decent unit. Buy this and pesants in China will not starve this month, at least not everyday."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful","This movie was AWFUL. Terrible acting, very poor sound/film quality, VERY cheaply made. I was dying to see this, but what a big disappointment it was. I cannot express enough how awful this movie was. Don't waste your time."
2,What were they thinking?,"My mother got this movie from BestBuy, I looked at her like she was crazy because I never heard of it but she got it anyway. This movie sucked. The acting was horrible. The only reason I'm giving this movie 2stars is for the songs and the singing. That was the only good thing about this movie. Buy at your own risk..."
1,grindcore?,"I really don't know what to make of this album. Is it a joke? I would rather listen to the worst finnish hardcore band, than listen to this garbage. This is not grindcore. I really don't know what this is, but If you are looking for REAL grindcore check out Brutal Truth, Terrorizer, Repulsion, Nasum, Napalm Death, Carcass, etc."
1,Grindcore?,"Scene flavor of the week. This is more like circus music with laughable, sub-par metalcore-like riffs thrown in. People have drawn comparisons to the intricacy of old D.E.P and real tech grind like Discordance Axis. This isn't even close to being anything like old DEP or DxAx. Anyone who thinks this is grindcore (or good for that matter) should question their erroneous opinions, Daughters suck."
3,"Good Lord, what the hell is this?","A friend sent me the song ""Pants, Meet Sh*t"" over AIM, branding it with the label ""spazzcore"". After hearing the rest of the album, it fits perfectly.This band is insane. The vocals are reminiscent of most of the chugga-chugga-breakdown sceneXcore bands that have soared in popularity, but the music behind it...wow. Sonic Youth as a grindcore band. Avant-garde noise metal. A pure cathartic release.I'm not very well versed in this type of music, but I DO know that I like this. Alot. I only wish it was longer (14 minutes!?) and that it had more variety."
4,Ok,"Piercing, short and fast yet palpable enough to make an indie rocker like grindcore. Clocks in at about 11 minutes, and they call this a full length mind you.I have to admit though, as much as I enjoy this album, I haven't brought myself to buy it yet. The first reason being that I have several qualms with paying just as many dollars as minutes, the second being my distaste for some of the members of the band. I still think they're highly talented, and I regretfully admit that I like it better than ATSS.If you have ever uttered the phrase ""Keep the art rock out of grindcore,"" stay away from Daughters, they epitomize it well."
5,People need to grow up,"Honestly, people who claim this isn't grindcore should take a minute and think. When did anybody in this band ever claim to be grindcore? This is nothing like any other band, its something orginal and all everyone can do is rag about how this isnt grindcore. Instead of listening to every generic grind band, give this band credit for doing something original. By the way this cd is great, any fan of this should check out as the sun sets, this was the band before daughters."
4,Honda Odyssey Bug Deflector,"Is not a full length cover like some. Designed to follow the hood line nicely and a snap to install, even if your skill level is only handy with a screwdriver.Hardware for installation could be a little better in quality."
3,Telesteps - An Opinion based on experience,"This product has been used by my company for over 4 years and we have been through at least 10 of these by 2 people. The feet do not last over a month (original rubber feet) and the telescoping feet cost $70.00 a pair and last about 1 year. If you do not keep the ladder clean (in other words do not WORK with it) it will shortly jam up and will not open.There is NO customer service to speak of except email and their warranty is a joke. BUT - THIS LADDER IS INVALUABLE TO MY COMPANY BECAUSE WE ENTER ATTICS EVERYDAY AND CANNOT IMAGINE WORKING WITHOUT THE CONVENIANCE OF THE TELESCOPING LADDER. I just wish customer service was better, the warranty was valid, and most of all the product was more durable."
4,Quick to work ladder,"I purchased this Telesteps 1600, 250 pound ladder for traveling in my trailer. Easy to open and light enough for an older guy to handle.I have several extension ladders, this one takes them out.Negatives.Letting down with the 2 small release rings, and no instruction on how to keep your fingers out of the way. Also Do not set on soft ground.I recommend this ladder for someone that really likes quick set up."
3,Ick,"Two of the most self-absorbed characters in a long time...had a lot of potential, but Jock and Chas were too annoying for me to care."
1,No quality control.,"This copy was obviously scanned by some automated system. Many alphabetic characters were not properly scanned. Here is an example from page 1: Died III lier lii'sidence, : West Somerset Str'(, Phiihulelphia, Janiiarv ""), 1010.""Don't yuu have any quality control procedures?? All that would be required is flip through the book and note that the entire book is a mess!!"
3,mom of irish twins,"I love the consept of this game. their are two things I don't like. Its very picky on how you write it so my son (3) gets frustrated very quickly with it. Also their is only room for one child on the sign in screen, and I have two."
3,Some problems...,"It's a great program, BUT...If your kid has small hands then they will inevitably press their hand against the screen (along with the pen) whereby the program thinks their hand is the pen. And chaos breaks loose on the screen when they practice a letter.You'll have to tape a popsicle stick or something along the bottom of the screen so they can lean their hand on that instead."
5,The guy above is stupid,"Alrigt, first off i'm not some stupid kid, i just didnt want to fill out the form...Second, that guy is a moron. The motors that are used on this go-quad are made by ""Zenoah Komatatsu."" This company makes engines for EVERYTHING, including Construction machines like bulldozers. The motors are incredible, i'm a hardcore gopeder and i know quite a bit about em.THese go-quads are awsome, mainly designed for racing, but are a lot of fun and very easy to use. THe drive system is a spindle, which requires much less maintence, unlike belt drives which snap belts like crazy."
1,Sucks!!!!,This kart sucks. I havent bought it but my friend might get one. I fly these R.C. plasnes and some engines are gas powerd. Well Zenoah is one of the gas engines that are used and made for Giant Scale planes usually 80 inch wingspan. And also did you see how the motor shat in the pic works. Theres not even a belt iyt just set on it. If you bump it or anything the shaft wont drive the wheel. It sucksssss!!!!! Please Trust me on this.
2,Too Small!!!,"I ordered this locket because it specifically said it was for a child, it was cute, and had a short chain. When I received the locket it was so tiny that it was impossible to put any photos inside and was too small to just wear as jewelry. I went back to Amazon and ordered a larger heart locket at the same price. It is just the right size to put two photos inside. It even came with a template to help cut the photos and plastic to hold the photos in place in the locket. I would definitely order more of these for other children in the family. The product code is:Sterling Silver Heart Locket on Cable Chain, 18"""
4,A Fairy Tale explained,"Night Dance is an interesting tale of the 12 Dancing Princesses combined with the legend of King Arthur. It takes on the more modern version of the fairy tale with the one armed soldier ending up with the princess, but the tale itself becomes more explained. It gives a reason why the father locked up the daughters and how the island came to be, though the ending seems a little rushed. It better develops the personalities of the princesses and shows why the knight picked the youngest, plus having more action and magic. Besides the ending, the only corny part was when the island was created, but it least is explained throughly and for what reason. If you enjoy this series or fairy tales, this is a must read."
4,liked it,"This book was a pleasant, light read. However, I was dismayed that the author left the plot slightly undeveloped. Also, it seems as if the antagonist is thwarted too easily.None-the-less, i enjoyed it and it is quite a satisfying read."
4,Roll out the red carpet...,"Camp Lo will probably forever be remembered by hip-hop audiences for ""Luchini"". But the problem they have now is whether or not they can be said to still have a fanbase because they have taken half a decade off between each album. Thankfully, their latest album Black Hollywood is full of good stuff.Sonny Cheeba and Geechi Suede still have the goods to paint vivid lyrical pictures, especially when it comes to stories. Case in point: while songs about gold-digging women are beginning to get played out, ""Material"" is rather interesting. And ""Jack n' Jill"" is a love story not to be taken lightly. Other highlights include ""Sweet Claudine"", ""Posse from the Bronx"" and the metaphorically dope ""Pushahoe"".While only 35 minutes in length, Camp Lo proves with this album that they still know how to drop on-point rhymes. Though at times they might be showing signs of age (see ""Soul Fever""), you still shouldn't mind taking a trip to Black Hollywood.Anthony Rupert"
4,Gimme More Gimme More,"AAwww at last, my boys are BACK! A little of the old, a little of the new... New beats yet the same soulfull swagger! The album was long overdue but well worth the wait. Big ups to the LO! This is definately a keeper!"
3,Doesn't sound right by me...,"Kanda recorded and produced this album in South Africa. However unlike Welcome to South Africa which he also recorded in South Africa, but with mostly seasoned Soukouss musicians like Dali Kimoko, Ngouma Lokito and Lokassa, among others, Kanda uses mostly South African musicians on this one and the whole thing doesn't sound right. Even the guitar work is not as polished as the previous works and sounds a little strange, for the lack of a better word. The South African influnences on Swalati are heavily evident on most songs, like the Mbanqanga on the title track which Kanda did with David Masondo and The Black Moses (Ngwenya) of The Soul Brothers. The production is not up to the high standards that we have come to expect from Congolese musicians however and if you're new to Kanda you'll be better off buying some of his old stuff instead. Unless if you're looking for something a little bit eclectic of course."
5,me likey words,me likey words and me like the read. Rushmore is words I read. I read the words and have a big time.
4,Watch the Movie First,"I dare use the word ""quirky,"" because that usually means ""esoteric and/or pedantic."" But ""Rushmore"" manages to be quirky while still being entertaining and heartful. There is real emotional impact in this film, as sharp and hurtful as first love lost. Yet, it remains a brilliant comedy with enough ""moments"" to make repeated viewings worthwhile. The book only serves as a fond memory of the film, much as the soundtrack. See the movie first, then buy the book to cherish the experience again."
3,Typical overpriced college textbook,Its a crime what they charge for text books. Book arrived on time and served its purpose. That's about all I can say other than ridiculous. The book (new) cost almost as much as the course itself????
4,Elements of Photogrammetry,I bought this book for a class I was dreading and so far the book is my favorite part of this class. This book is written in a plain and understandable way. It has so far been a great tool for studying photgrametric principles.
2,a ballet without magic,"This meant to be a classic ballet is somehow disappointing...not that the dancers did not make their most,but it lacks magic ,I'd venture to say.The music by Aragón is of no consequence,though serving the choreography ,fairly good ,touching here and there real quality as in ""Pas de sept"" , the dwarves given the chance to display their good dancing skills.Tamara Rojo of the Royal Ballet did not shine out as she would,had she been given a better choreography to display her immense techique.As for her partner,Urluzaga, he surely was a more than correct Prince.This said, this is not a ballet to make history either for its music or its choreography."
4,instant broth,"my wife had this product in the hospital,and ask me to tast it we both find it to be very tasty. we now use it at home."
1,Bit on the blurry side,"Well, after reading the other reviews I decided to TRY these out against my better judgement. You can write just fine with the overlay applied. There is no problem at all on my M505. However, seeing the screen is a bit tough. Not sure what type of materials they use, but I would think they could find something a bit more transparent. I would recommend that you do NOT buy these overlays. The lack of clarity is reason enough. Application was a breeze though... :)"
2,Screen Not So Clear and it creates stained apperance,"Other Reviews suggest that this screen protector provide a clearer and more transparent alternative to Write-Right. But, both were about same as far as clearity. However, this product adds some unpleasant uneven look of Palm screen some part of the edge. Only positive comment I have for this product is that this product creates firmer writing surface and less expensive compare to Write-Right."
3,not the flavors pictured,"candy came fast but was not what was pictured. It was the new variety with mango and pinapple, NO watermelon or blue. bummer"
1,Not compatible with Windows XP,Be forewarned if you intend to purchase this camera new or used. It comes with drivers for Windows 98 but none are available for Windows XP. I do not know if the drivers work with any other versions of Windows.
3,Alien,"The condition of the box was a little messy..wrinkles in the cardboard box, but it was used so what can ya expect. The triple pact though is definately one to own if your an Alien fan!"
3,Great & Unique Work,"I thought this project when released was skillful, but before it's time. There was something quite different in the way this production was put together. From my understanding, the project was actually a demo-version of the production. I've listened to the updated version recently and see that it is a must hear project. I've also listened to some of the new work coming from DEG Records. I believe this time around, Brother Art is in the industry loop and standards. Being able to have the original copy here though will eventually be a classic piece for my future library. The project is very personal as Brother Art takes us through his life's journey. The only set back was the mastering work by the previous producers."
2,shrunk - almost too small for pillow,"These pillowcases kept their shape after washing, but they are almost too small for our pillows. We don't have very big pillows, but these cases have to be stretched to reach the edges."
4,A little advice to anyone owning an Arcos,"The Arcos is fantastic! Although I do not own one myself, my friend owns one and I get regular use out of it... what a cool dude. But to the point of my entry: When you first get the Arcos, DON'T go straight into using it without charging the battery first. This is what my friend did, and we figured this is what cause the battery to be so pathetic. He re-ordered and CHARGED the new one first, resulting in a better battery. So remember to charge the Arcos BEFORE you use it 4 the first time."
1,What's with the strange edges,"The strange edges makes it quite difficult to attached to the dashboard. It is not as sleek as the Lyra. Too Heavy and way too expensive even the 20GB model. Its all-plastic compared to the Lyra that at least uses aluminum ofr the back for HDD protection. The screen is better though, that's all.I returned my item because I thought I could get used to the weight and shape of the thing. Because of its odd shape, it doesnt really look very well installed in my dash.I will have to wait when they revised the shape to be more like the Lyra."
5,The Nightingale Gallery,Very well written and enjoyable to read. It contained a lot of actual history and a lot of humor. Right up there with Brother Cadfel.
1,Too-hasty publication,"As someone who has enjoyed the Hamish MacBeth series, I was looking forward to some light entertainment but was sadly disappointed. The basic ingredients are all there for a satisfying cosy with TWO spunky heroines and double love interests, but The author failed to deliver on the promise.Perhaps the situations were supposed to be humorous coincidences, but they stretched far beyond humor and were too far-fetched to be believable, and there was ample evidence of sloppy writing and no editing. For example, in one scene the heroine goes to a luncheon that is to feature a speech by a noted occultist. Instead, with no explanation, the scene unfolds with a speech by the hostess on vegetarianism instead.If you are looking for a modern historical mystery with a light touch, I would recommend Jacqueline Winspear's Maisis Dobbs series instead."
3,Not bad,"Although this book is not up to the standards of some of Beaton's better works, it is not bad.It is a pleasant read and does not require stressing one's gray cells too much. It is entertaining.It does give me some sympathy for my ancestors and I feel sadness for the treatment/suffering of my female ancestors.Worth reading."
5,Memory,"I'm so scared that it will run slow on my computer,I have 256, the min,will it? Also I cannot get the body shop to run on the computer I will be using sims 2 on(hopefully) but I can on the other, whats the deal and does that mean that it might mess up up and I cant play sims 2?ahhhhh help,computer nerds help..btw I mean that in a good way!:)"
1,"Taking back my ""non-review....""","Within hours of emailing amazon with a complaint and posting a review complaining about the shipping date, my Sims 2 had shipped and will be here on Friday. The best of luck to everyone still getting an October ship date."
4,I pre ordered it,"I pre ordered it from another online vendor and I got free one day shipping and I tracked the order. It said it should be arriving today, too bad i'm still at school...but i can't wait to go back home and play the game!"
3,The Sims 2,"The Sims 2 is a pretty good game, but it is slow. From what I have done so far on the game, it is good, and if it went faster, I would probably like it even better. I love that you can create more features for the sims people and the houses and such. Please visit my website, http://dodgeroo54.tripod.com , bookmark the site, and please visit often because I update almost every day. ON my site, I have the latest info about reality shows, Harry Potter, Ellen Degeneres, Bizarre Holidays, Dumb Laws, and more! Please visit."
5,"EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT, CALM DOWN","I preordered my Sims2 in Feb. it gave me an oct. date, i was really like, mad. but today it shipped! so just cuz it says oct. doesnt mean it will come in oct!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Cool new features, but not worth the wait!","I loved the first Sims game. I was, in fact, one of those college kids who played it in her dorm room in lieu of studying. Years later, the second one comes out and I was eagerly anticipating it. Yes, the new features are cool, and yes, the graphics are neat. However, the five-plus minutes you wait for the game to load (on my brand-new loaded Sony desktop) is NOT so cool. This game takes up so much memory to run that you can't do anything else on your computer while you're waiting for the game to load, and there are many, many lags.In addition, it's not very user-friendly. It's very difficult to zoom in or out, or scroll around your Sims' houses.Overall, this game could be really neat, but I am just not willing to sit around and wait."
3,"very, very, Dissapointed","I was reallylooking forward to spending the next few months obseesed and in love with this game, butinstead I found myself in a stupid and very tedious game that is mcuh less interesting the life its self. But I guess I just wasn't made for this kind of game."
5,"The Sims Gold Date is Sep. 17, 2004",People that have found the game early are lucky that either their web site or their retailer got the game early. The official release date is not until friday. That means that some places can recieve their copies from the 13 to the 17 usually the places can't release a title until the gold date but Maxis has made an exception with the sims 2.
5,Content still all that was expected!,"Ok so I was a little more than miffed Tuesday when I seemed to be like the thousands/millions of other people trying to get their hands on the copy of the game. In the past I have had no problems at all purchasing a game ON its release date, however this time proved to be a little different. I WAS able to finally get a copy from the local EB Games store ...the last copy they had! But putting all that aside...it is well worth the wait. Best way to describe the new version is the OLD one but on steroids! Looking forward to many more hours of Jerry Springer type scenarios :)"
5,Should you wait or preorder?,"I know that many people have been wondering the advantages of waiting and the advantages of pre-ordering, so I will cover them:Pre-Ordering:You will get the game ASAPYou will be one of the first to have the gameYou can order the DVD (rumors say that this edition will be preorder only)You can ease the pain of waitingWaiting:More solid fan base by the time you orderYou are not rushed into a desisionYou may be able to get it cheaper or with extra featuresIf you wait long enough (early 2005), you can order an expansion pack too.I think I will preorder myself."
4,Good game,"This is a lot better than the first sims. Even though it is lacking the vast amount of items that the first one had after all the expansions its still fun. The amount of items to make stores and places to go is a let down. The game play is a lot better. The game does seem to have a bug of some sort where is freezes your computer at random. I save a lot now just in case. I thought it might have just been my computer but the 2 other people i know that have it, theirs has frozen too and i believe this problem is even listed on the sims 2 site. The dvd version is better than the cd version as it loads faster and installs much faster than the multiple cd version. Besides the freezing problem and lack of items, which i know they will fix and come out with expansions and downloads, this was a great purchase."
5,The Sims 2,"This is wonderful! For those of you that are having trouble, you put the CD in your computer dvd rom hardrive. Not all computers have a dvd rom hardrive so if your computer does not, return this and got the cd rom version. This game is not different from the cd rom version you just instead but the disk into a different place. For those of you that say the game is slow on old computers, it isnot. My computer is atleast seven years old and it runs fine. This game rocks"
1,Very Disappointing,"Hey all you Sim lovers,I (along with other Sim lovers) have been waiting for almost a year for the Sims 2 to come out. I bought a copy of it yesterday, and I am very disappointed with the game. It first took an hour and a half to load, as my computer wasn't reading the disk. After I finally downloaded it, I tried playing and it's extremely slow. The graphics are terrible, and after I tried changing the graphics to 'high' the whole game froze. It is also really difficult to move around in the game. It takes forever to load and even longer to make you Sims do anything. I would seriously think twice before buying this game."
4,So excited,"(I'm not under 13, I'm 16)I'm so excited, i've been waiting for this game all year, or at least since March when it was supposed to come out. TS2 is going to be so much fun, being able to watch your sims go through life or not if you turn that mode off, finally being able to build a house more than 2 stories, weddings, funnerals, you name it! The only downside is that it isn't part of the original sims game. I have spent tons of money that i have earned to get all the sims and expansion packs, now i will have to buy another one that doesn't even work with them. But...I'm still really excited and thankful that it is finally being released!!!"
1,Not another 5 years of expansion packs!!! Noooooo!!!!,"As much as I enjoyed the first Sims and nabbed it the first week of release I realized after a while what a pox it was. Will Wright, the talent that gave us Sim City and all its offspring has been doing nothing else new creativley due to having to work on the Sims, and even SimCity 4 is tainted by the Sim characters you can import into your town.I wish this Sim fad would go the way of the beany babies."
2,Read the Review First!,"I am highly disappointed with this CD...not the content, per say, but the set up. Why on earth did they make the whole thing on only one track? My personal CD player does not have a fast forward option (as most personal players do not) so if I want to listen to the Evening Meditation I have to listen through the Introduction and the entitre Morning Meditation first (23 minutes). Another reviewer has said the same thing, if I would have just read the review first I would have spent my money elsewhere. Bernie Siegel is a fine MD, and the content of this CD is fine, but VERY poor design."
2,not well organized,"I agree with an earlier reviewer that this CD is not set-up well. One cannot access the ""Morning"" and ""Evening"" meditations separately because everything is on one hour-long track.Also you cannot skip the intro and go directly to the meditations.There should be 3 tracks not one."
5,Family Matters,"I would like to buy the DVD's, when will the DVD's be available to the public. It is a great TV show. Why is it taking so long?I love this show it is the greatest..... Please let's get the DVD's out to the public.Thank YouClaudette"
5,Great show,"I really hope they release this show on DVD. I have looked everywhere for it. I would buy it right now if it were out. If there is any news of it coming out, post something."
5,NEED DVD RELEASE,"CAN WE PLEASE GET THE COMPLETE SET OF FAMILY MATTERS, FRESH PRINCE OF BELAIR AND LIVING SINGLE!!!! THESE SITCOMS ARE ALL TIME FAVORITES!!! I HAVE MARTIN AND I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE REST OF THESE SETS TO COMPLETE MY 90S TV SERIES!!!! I ORDER A LOT FROM YALL, AND IT IS UPSETTING THAT THESE CLASSICS ARE NOT AVAILABLE!!! THERE ARE ONLY SEPERATE SEASONS AND MOST OF THEM ARE ONLY 1 AND 2!!!! SOME ARE THE FIRST AND THIRD BUT NONE OF THEM ARE ALL OF THEM!! THERE IS NO NEED TO HAVE JUST ONE OF THE SEASONS!! YOU HAVE TO WATCH THEM ALL!!! PLEASE GET IN IF POSSIBLEFamily Matters: The Complete First Season"
2,Beware of bad discs,"The quality of most of the DVDs were good, except one. The last two episodes on disc two are digitized and won't play. Three months after I bought the first set, I had Amazon replace them and the same two episodes on the second disc of the replacement boxed set were also bad; I decided to live with it, so if you buy this boxed set, beware, you may not be able to view two of the episodes."
5,So happy,What a great news that this series finally gets released on DVD (Blu-ray would be even better). No longer me and my family need to watch the bad quality videos downloaded from the net.What a great day!!
2,Disappointed,"I waited for this to become available on Amazon for months, and was pleasantly surprised when the first season appeared for sale, so of course-I went on ahead and made my purchase.Boy was I disappointed to have received a defective set of dvd's.The first disc played without any hitches until I anxiously entered the second disc to play-which did not, all I amable to see is a black screen with pure sound."
4,"Great watch, despite lack of special features!","If Warner Bros. wants to release subsequent seasons of Family Matters, they really have to put some major effort in the special features department. I just got Season One on DVD, and while I am pleased with the boxset as a whole, there is a TOTAL disregard for special features. No commentaries, no optional foreign language tracks, no original ABC promos, nothing of the sort. I was expecting hours upon hours of special features, but WB failed to deliver. I want these features on the Season Two boxset, provided that there is one. Warner Bros., either put more special features on Season Two, or don't release it at all. (Don't make the fans wait too long, either.)"
5,The Complete Series,"I am so glad that Amazon finally decided to release Family Matters. However, I'm going to wait until you release all 9 seasons to purchase. No offense, but, I want the entire show at once. Getting it season by season would be too much of a teaser to me."
3,Love the show!!,"I grew up watching this show and I love it to this day. It's nice to sit down and watch a family show thats not filled with sex or stupid plots, but funny and heart warming stories. I love this show and can't wait for it to come out on DVD!!"
5,"What's keeping this ""Family"" from ""Mattering""?","I watched this show for 9 years and it was much better than it's predecessor ""Perfect Strangers"". ""Family Matters"" was the spinoff from Perfect Strangers Marie Jo Peyton played the security guard Harriet Winslow on tha show. So producers decided to spin her off unto her own show. I loved her show better! I stopped watching ""PS"" and started watching ""FM"" for it's entire 9 year run. It was sad when they replaced ""Harriette"" in the last season because Marie Jo was upset that her show became the Steve/Laura/Carl show. Eddie grown into being a really hot looking man! Damn those biceps he has! So when are they coming out with the DVDS?"
2,4 episodes dont play,"Same issue,purchased from warners brothers.First set episodes 13-16 dont play,they sent me another and same issue.They promised they would look into it.Im still waiting.As far as the other episodes,they were excellent."
5,erkel,"Best show I have seen, they dont make them like this anymore. I still would rather watch this then any sitcom on MTV. My family and I used to just call the show ""erkel"" because he was the main stand out and a great actor. it got weird towards the end with transportation inventions and personality switches but it was still good. and the best episodes is where erkel turnes into bruce lee.TURN THIS INTO DVD OREVEN BETTER BLUE RAY NOW!!!!"
5,"""DID I DO THAT""?","This was single handedly the greatest sitcom ever produced! I can't believe it EVER went off the air. Steve Urkel is the funniest t.v. character in the universe! Jaleel White was born to play this lovable nerd. He seems so boring when he's just normal! Steve Urkel was the crowning moment of Jaleel White's career. T.V. sucked ever since this show was cancelled! I've been searching stores for years, just hoping it would be released on DVD Box Sets. Why on earth hasn't this been released on DVD when even the Fresh Prince has?There's a website called dvdcollections.tv that has the complete 9-seasons of Family Matters in one Big Box Set [215 uncut episodes on 24 DVD's] for $69.99. But I don't know if these are high quality recordings or not, so that's why I was affraid to order them! I wish there was some way I could find out!"
5,Bring back Urkel and Carl!,"I was shocked when I searched to buy some ""Family Matters"" seasons and found that none are available. Although I enjoy ""Full House"", some of it's episodes are so sweet they're sappy! Family Matters on the other hand, did a much better job of balancing the comedy with the ""family values"" theme. The funniest scenes were between just Carl and Steve- my favorite being the one where Carl is attempting to teach Urkel to ride a bike- simply hilarious. Please bring this show to DVD- I'll be the first in line to purchase my copy!!"
5,Missing Urkel,"My family and I have always loved this series. It was an awesome show, it's rare to see it in re-runs. I would absolutely buy this series if and when it comes available. I don't know what is taking so long. Other programs that were playing along side FM have long since been released on DVD. I guess somethings are just worth waiting for...but hopefully not much longer."
4,The Simplified Hydroponics Workbook,I live in Manhattan and had used this book as a guide to buy a small commercially available system. I have used this reference for about a year. The section on planting and lighting is excellent. Like the book says I have flowers in January. This year I will try growing mellons. I took key pages out and taped them next to my system for references. It was an easy read. I like the poetic style of writing.
4,"Good stories, and that is all that counts.","Setting aside all the silly politics of orientation and gender bias, how do the stories read? Quite well, for the most part. Some are quite gentle, tinged with an atmosphere of bittersweet romance. The stories A Light Minute and New York, N.Y. by Way of Taos, N.M being good examples. Others are firmly placed in the technoir/cyberpunk genre I know that the author loves dearly. The edge of your seat grabber Hot Definiton being a particular outstanding choice read in that department. Those wanting more sex focused stories and not hungering for real stories with just a basis in sex or sexuality had better look elsewhere. When picking this anthology up, the reader should really put down all the phony preconceptions about what a writer should or should not be and just concentrate on the important part of reading, which is and always will be the story - not s/he who tells it. Recommended."
2,Disappointing,"There are a few good pieces in this collection, but the majority are par or below. Overall it just doesn't live up to the ""provocative lesbian erotica"" promise. If nothing else, the typos alone ruin the mood for the reader. I recommend ""Best Lesbian Erotica 2000/2001"" instead (which does include ""Dress Pinks,"" one of Christian's better pieces)."
1,"Lacking in emotion, a gimmick","The concept of ""genderbending"" has been applied lately to erotic lit, and this book shows some of the troubling aspects of that. Of course men have been writing women's stories and vice versa for ages in straight lit and other genres. But when it comes to sexuality, at least modern erotic literature that has some class to it, there is a need for truth and authentic emotion. If there's some reason that a straight man should be lauded for writing lesbian erotica, it is not obvious from this book. Avoid, there's so much better lesbian erotica available from people who understand it from the inside."
4,Just good writing,"The author's gender becomes completely irrelevant when one reads this book. As a fan of this genre, I read a lot of stories but I can always trust that M. Christian will tell a great story that just happens to have sex threaded through it. He isn't interested in gender-bending or experimenting with sexuality -- he is just a consummate story teller with a penchant for sexual subjects and taboos."
4,Great Fun!,"This was upbeat and fun for my 18 month old. She really liked it, but seemed to lose interest before the end. I've been letting her watch it during quiet time in the afternoon recently and now she watches the entire video and asks to watch it again. I've grown to like it more now than I did when I first previewed it and it's a bonus that she also seems more interested in it now too!"
3,Not Too Pleasing,"I was interested in buying the series because my daughter was dancing to a commercial but once i purchased the dvd, my daughter wasn't too attntive to it. Her interest lasted no more than a week, so it was a waste of money."
5,Great movie!,"Excellent movie, keeps the kids attention while playing decent music for them to listen to. Very funny and cute, both my 1 and 4 year old enjoy this one."
3,Decent,"This is a decent DVD... but my son way prefers the Curious Buddies ""Let's Build"". This one seems to bore him, just can't keep his interest. Maybe girls would like this one better, who knows."
3,Turns Kids into Eddie Haskell,"The DVD itself isn't that funny or entertaining for an adult, but just wait until it's over. For the next hour or so, your toddler will be so sugary and accommodating, you'll be happy when it wears off and you have your usual howler-monkey back. It makes you appreciate your rude little cave-babies while possibly imparting some lasting lessons about manners and cleaning up toys to them. The puppets are of the same ilk as those on Jack's Big Music Show (same production company), but the writing, voicework and music are not. This will not entertain anyone older than five. It shouldn't have to, but with Jack, that's a bonus."
2,Sleeper,"Im sure the information is accurate but a DVD does no justice to the learning process. And it does feel very outdated even though the information is still current. Not much as changed in the massage world.I fell asleep sitting in my chair so I must rate accordingly, sorry...A pro or student in school with lots of people to practice on, may enjoy this more."
5,The Best Chocolate for your fountain,I always purchase Sephra chocolate for my chocolate fountain and have never had a problem. The taste and quality is superb!
4,Good but not Great,"It is good chocolate but not great. It doesn't flow as well as the homemade stuff I made, which was only chocolate chips and oil. Not impressed, but it did taste good. It was too expensive for how it worked."
2,About As Usefull As The First One,"Although this strategy guide is more usefull than the one for the first game, I still don't think it's a must buy, or a buy at all! Oh sure it provides maps for the dungens, but since the dungens aren't random anymore it's simple enough to make maps yourself. I do find it usefull that they tell you where all the secret rooms are, but once I get the rumble pack for my controller that's not going to help much either! All this does is really tell you story ahead of time for those who have trouble playing the whole game through first, and to make cash! I personally do want to see the game make money, but not through this. I think your money is best spent somewhere else."
1,still waiting,Never received the product because you said you were out of stock. Still have not received my credit either
5,"""Feelgood"" film","What's not to like about this film. Nice soundtrack, normal people and great story with plenty of comic relief. Don't be so up-tight. Get out more often!"
5,Loving Jezebel,"It was fun watching this on DTV, so we ordered to look at it again and again. Unfortunately, I didn't notice I was ordering a VHS tape. Still had fun looking at it again."
3,Better than Average But,it gets lost somewhere in the Middle&ending.when I saw the Preview I though it was gonna be a bit more Balanced but it didn't quite get there.interesting at first but it does become a waste&just goes through the Motions after a while.Hill Harper has Talent but this Film doesn't showcase Him fully to me.still worth taking a look at.it has some good moments.
4,paul hardcastle jazzmasters 4,"A friend of mine gave me the cd as a gift, I have been playing it for the last two days and i love the cd. I have not had a hardcastle in several years and I will get more of his stuff now."
4,Paul: What were you thinking (if you were)?,"This is a really great CD until you get to the last track. If I had to guess why this ""track"" was added, I'd say that either Paul felt extreme pity for the rapper and just wanted to give the guy a job, or Paul was in debted to this guy in a big way.Great CD, but do yourself a favor and prevent yourself from listening to this ridiculous last track, to keep it from being remembered as a low point for Paul."
4,what happened?,"Been a big fan of yours for many years. You send my wife and I on a ""spiritual journey"" to another planet. But what happened to Jazzmasters 4 with #13, ""the rap"". Completely out of tune with your other greats. Found it disappointing, especially the last song which should be your best. Look forward to your next one (when?) but without the rap"
4,Very good mid-range grinder,"It is quite heavy so if you plan to move it around then you may want to get a different grinder. The grinds are very consistent and it is quite quiet, I think all gear reduction grinders are quiet. I use it exclusively for French press but might try it for expresso. People that want to buy things based on pound for the dollar should look at reviews in Consumers Digest, they are very good at that. There are a lot of lower priced grinders out there that will do a decent job, of course they will be just as messy, with same static problem and noise. This grinder is a step up from those and gives you very consistent grinds with less noise, if that is not important for you, then you might not be happy with this grinder."
3,Love Stephen King,"I love Stephen King, but found this book to be a little boring. After you've read a chapter or two of interviews, it becomes very boring"
5,The Last Confederate- Great Movie!,"The Last Confederate is the moving TRUE story of a Civil War soldier and his family. It is made more meaningful by the fact that it was a family product and labor of love. The director, Julian Adams clearly has a great deal of talent. He has a bright future as either a director, or actor or both. I recommend this to anyone who has an interest in history, family ties or someone who just wants to be entertained!"
1,Don't Bother,"This is simple a poorly made film. The acting is mediocre; the sets and costuming are far from authentic or accurate to the period. I'm sure that the folks who made this piece were sincere in their attempt, but it just doesn't made the grade. Try Ang Lees' ""Ride With the Devil"" or ""Pharoah's Army"" if you're looking for quality films about the Civil War. I felt like I wasted my money on this DVD."
1,The last Confederate,"Maybe I bought the wrong version at Amazon Germany even though it is in English as well as German of course. The long and the short of it: plenty of soap, little action, confusing sequence of scenes, disappointing for a Civil War buff like myself, waste of money!"
1,The Last Confederate: The Story of Robert Adams,"This a great story to tell, but the family should have let professional handle it. The movie was poorly done. My favorite part of history is the Civil War. My own great grandfathers were vets. Who by the way fought on different sides of the war. I didn't understand the movie. If he was the last confederate that it what the story should have been about. He part in the Civil War but most important his life after the Civil War how he lived, what he did after the war till his death. That would be most interesting. I hope you redo his life story. It's a story worth the tell."
2,Applegator43,Bought this and thought it was going to be great but I have seen a lot better than this. Was disappointed but now it is in my collection. Maybe someone else will enjoy it more.
1,Should not have been distributed.,"I thought the kid who played Anakin Skywalker in the last, horrible, Star Wars films had set the standard for wooden, awkward performances. Then I saw this film and realized that wooden performances had been taken to a new level. It's just not terribly interesting if you've seen Cold Mountain. The performances are like those of an extremely earnest 15 year old in his first theatre production."
4,GREAT ACTION MOVIE,I really enjoyed this movie. It has great romance and terrific action scenes. The cinematography is wonderful and I loved the history part of it. It is definitely worth seeing and I highly recommend it to all!Bill
3,The Last Confederate,"It was OK, not at all sorry I bought it, it gave all the appearances of someone getting up one morning and saying ""Let's make a movie""."
3,Good but boring,"The movie itself was alright, it could have been better done but its also based on a true story so take it for what its worth."
4,The story of Robert Adams in the C/W,"This is a true story of a Confederate Captain during the last year of the Civil War and his love for a woman from PA., The familys of both had a part in the making of this film and it is very accurate in the action, uniforms and what happened at that time. I got this used on Amazon at a very fair price."
3,The Last Confederate,It was okay I wouldn't spend alot of money for it but if you can gat it for a good price it's worth watching It just wasn't as good as I expected.
2,Audio very bad,"The story line was very interesting however the audio of the CD was very bad, very hard to hear and understand."
1,oh my God.....,"While this movie had a desent plot to it, I would not however recomend it to anyone. As a person who is big on historical accuracy i couldnt stand to watch this movie. I would love to know where soldiers were getting their ammunition as none of them were wearing any cartridge boxes. One of the Union Soldiers was was wearing an army coat and blue jeans. Most of the battle scenes were fought by diorganized mobs, which never would happen during the civil war. The main character was an Infantry Captain, he was wearing no rank insignia and a wore an enlisted mans uniform. And biggest HE RODE A HORSE! Junior Infantry officers never rode horses unless on staff which he was not. Bad movie in my mind."
3,Pretty Good,This is a fairly good movie except where the dead yankee forgets to take off his wrist watch about 8 minutes into the picture. I don't understand why goofs like this still happens in the movies. It often kills the mood.
2,history,"Very good story line, but the acting for the staring acters is not so good. Excellent performance by Mickey Rooney."
5,Engaging film,"I came across this movie by accident. It instantly grabbed my interest! It had a great storyline with a sensual romantic plot. My favorite part is when Robert Adams swims accross the river with force and passion, trying to get back to his love. Julian Adams, the lead actor, beautifully portrays a young mean torn between his lover and his country. He is clearly headed for stardom, and I can't wait to see him on the big screen. Definitely recommend seeing this one (I had to buy it!)"
2,What happened to All Star 2001,"This game was a great disappointment to me for several reasons: the graphics are ok, but the players don't look like who they are suppose to be. Big Mac, one of the most recognizable players, is just another face in the crowd. There is a good pitch selection, but just try to hit them. The batting controls are terrible, the base running and fielding controls are subpar, and what happened to the ability to change to camera angle?? Rent it before you buy it, or just go get All Star 2001 for the N64. Now there is a good baseball game."
1,A huge Disapointment for Allstar fans (nothing like the N64,"All-star baseball 2002 is a huge disapointment for all the All-Star baseball fans. 1st of all the camera ..., its way to low and you end up missing so many easy fly balls, the fielders are way to slow to react unlike the 64 version, Graphics are great but the game really makes you mad when you cant win because of pathetic reactions and camera angles. A total step backward for acclaim from the N64 version. If you want a good fun baseball game to play try the N64 versions, (they are so so so much better!!!!) Stay clear from this title unless you like being disapointed at losing whenever you do everything right, but the game doesnt allow for it. A huge mistake for acclaim I sure thought they would do better. A HORRIBLE GAME!!!!!!!"
2,All Star Baseball 2002-PSX2,"I also tried all the different baseball titles out this year for the PSX2 and NONE of them are even close. As for All Star, I actually thought it was pretty good-the game plays realistic but the game/player graphics are dull and flat. BUT, about 3 weeks into a preseason I discovered a MAJOR FLAW. You can't create any players in exhibition or series mode (that would include the playoffs) and you can be ONLY ONE TEAM in a season/playoff. What a Catch 22, well, I am sending mine back to acclaim to get one I can return for my money back. Dont they realize people have friends who don't want to spend an entire season being one teams opponent-while being denied a chance to run their own team."
2,High heat Baseball is 100 times better than this,"I found HHBB 2002 a lot better than this game.Gameplay (is bad) in this game.Specially when you trade players, this gane doesn't behave well.HHBB 2002 is better in those aspects."
2,Great graphics and boring game play,"The graphics are very good. But, the game play is terrible. There is no consistency to batting. Just when you've timed a pitch well and expect a great hit, it's a pop-up or a weak fly ball. And, hitting a home run is just too difficult. Perhaps Acclaim should remember that games are supposed to be FUN not frustrating."
3,Alright,"Graphics are pretty cool, new stadiums, mascots, and the players really look like themselves. But hitting is so hard, and fielding is even harder. When I thought I hit a ball deep in the gap the computer gets there in no time and even dives. On the otherhand I can never get there fast enough. Plyers are very slow. You can throw a guy out at first from the outfield sometimes. I have played 7 full games and have only won once. Trying to Hit is really frustrating."
5,The best out of 3,The game play has a few problems but stadiam and players look real. The create a player mode is great unlike HHBB2002 which has none. The options in season play are great and you can have a stort season or a long season. It really lacks in the camera views and gameplay. When the ball warps into a players hand when the ball is two feet away is unreal. A speed button is needed to help for baserunning and fielding in the outfield. The thowback uniforms are pretty cool you can go back to being the old brooklyn dodgers. The best out of 3. But always rent before you buy!!!!
2,Very disappointing.,"I will not get into the details as to why the PS2 version of All-Star Baseball is so much worse than the excellent N64 versions (see other reviews for that). Just suffice it to say that if you were waiting for ASB2002 on PS2 to get rid of your N64, you will need to make more shelf space to keep it around. Being a Madden Football and ASB addict on N64, the PS2 did more than justice with Madden for the PS2 (it is just amazing) - Baseball has been a different story! I am keeping my N64 and playing ASB on it rather than on the PS2.Very disappointing."
2,Not What i expected,"When i first bought this game i thought it was going to be great. The good thing about this game is that the player graphics are breath taking and the game play is really easy. Also the throw back uniforms are pretty cool. So what is it that it only got 2 stars. First of all the graphics for the stadiums are horrible. MLB 2K1 is a thousand times better. Second of all the commentary for the game is dull and boring, It is the samething over and over again. Last the game only has on camera angle and it just dosent fell like you are in the game. All in all this game was not what i expected. This is something i would expect from PS1 not PS2."
4,better than Triple Play,"With the baseball season in full swing, I decided to test the baseball market on PS2. I found out that Triple Play bothered me with it's sluggish gameplay so I tried All Star. I found a solid baseball game with a lot of depth. Team mascots, accurate batting stances, and easy to pick up fielding and pitching controls. Even with the difficulty set on rookie, it was a challenge. Even if I am beat, I am in awe of how solid it is. Grant it when you field the ball it could be 3 ft away but he will come up with it, but with such minor flaws, does it really matter. The commentary will leave you speechless and the extra animations will keep you interested for hours. Until something better comes along, this is the best baseball game on the PS2."
3,this game is ..........,"only ok. it could have been much better.the positives: the game is realistic and a true baseball simulation. the graphics are pretty good and the controls generally are smooth. it also has high re-play valuethe bad: very limited options. on the back of the box you are led to believe that this game has lots of options. sure there are 7 camera angles, but you cant control them. the 7 angles automatically appear depending on where the ball is hit. sure they have classic uniforms, but you cant select them, they just randomly appear during the season. also, there seems to be a split second time delay when fielding which takes a little getting used too. the game is realistic, but not for star players, iam 20 games into a season with the A's and Jason Giambi has 23 hrs and 41 rbis, but all other players have ""normal"" stats.bottom line, if you are a baseball fan you will like it, if not, dont bother."
2,Still waiting...,"I bought this game hoping that it would finally be THE great baseball game we have all been waiting for. Sad to say, I am still waiting. What's the deal with NO camera angle options...you get what they give you(and the angle for fielding SUCKS) and that's it! Batting and pitching are overly complicated and very slow, fielding is a joke (outfielders are able to get to balls that are not even close to them and make the catch), and if you don't change your pinch-hitter, he will be pitching for you next inning. 2 stars are for the beautiful but difficult to see graphics and the turn-back-the-clock uni's. And can someone tell me how can you get the camera angles that are shown on the game box itself? Theese close-up's and cross angles are not in this game! Isn't that false advertising?"
4,Entertaining,"Compared to other baseball games ,the grafics are good ...The game dificult is average ..If your a baseball fan you will love the oportunity to build a championship team , playing a full 162 game season , and keeping the stats of every member of your team.."
1,i hate this game,"it got one star because of a funny glitch, it actually happens alot, somethimes when my player comes up to bat he is still wearing his fielding glove its pretty funny and even after he gets on base he is still wearing the glove, thats pretty much the only good thing about the game"
3,OK...,"This game is okay because it's not too easy oor too hard,has decemt graphics GREAT Detail! Right down to the advertisements! Especcially my favorite park of themall YANKEE STADIUM!Good anamation,but not nearly perfect.BETTER than high heat 2004!(the overall game). What ASB 03 and ASB 04 dont have is Tony Gwynn and Paulie Oniell and Big MAC and other guys like that.Also theres a Hall of Fame Team (only living ledgends) (plus Catfish Hunter). There are downsides, though, NO FRANCHISE MODE! only a season mode but you can make it less than 162 games.Something you can't do in ASB 04.While this game has incredible realism and is pretty fun to play youll get tired of it after a while. I'd buy )03 orASB 04 insted but the best cherap game around is ASB 02!"
1,Gameplay,"I think my title pretty much says it. It wouldn't be so bad if you could adjust the views, particularly in the outfield when fielding a ball. It's just a bad angle. This game will definately frustrate you."
2,A let down,What a let down. I have been waiting for this game for some time now. When i sat down and played it i went 'what is this?' The gameplay was slow the controls difficult and the commentary awful. Do nt buy this game
2,HEYOCCASIONALPLAYERS!,"Too bad this was my first PS2 game. The graphics are awesome (which is why I bought the game) but the game moves are a bit difficult. If you are a ball fan, and want to play a quick game between the end of your job and the start of your team's next game, I'd reccomend sticking w/ PS1 and MLB 2002 and Triple Play. -- c'mon"
1,Unfairness at it's Best,"Now first off, I bought this game used, and after playing it I can see why. I can not defeat the computer. Anything you do is just countered. You score two runs in the first, the other team scores two runs in the first. Hit a home in the top of the 9th, the other team hits a home run to beat you. It is driving me nuts. Granted that the graphics are impressive, and the gameplay is mediocre. The gameplay aspect doesn't bother me. I would just like to sit down and have fun, and it is impossible to. So, instead of frustrating yourself beyond the point of return, choose another baseball game to play, this game takes itself too seriously."
2,dissapointment,"This game is a huge dissapointment. what gives with no camera angles, no injuries, of course no franchise, and an opposing outfielder runs at unhuman speeds to snag sure doubles or triples. of course you can hit home runs. i just finished a game as the Cubbies and won 8-1 behind 8 homers. i struck out 17 with ruben Quevedo!!!! how realistic is that. this game is not worth buying and it looks as though i will be firing up High Heat 2001 again this year on the old computer. at least there you can have more than a 25 man roster. what a waste of the sony2 power again. i always have madden."
1,stupidest game of all,[....]Any team can become the champs of all the teams. You can be the darn expos and be about 100 games above 500. The sliders break too much and the curveballs are just between a change up and a fastball. the first one you throw is always awesome. Acclaim needs to make the game a little harder. The batting stances are outta wack. The brewers my favorite team is underrated(of course). With good players you hit 500 homeruns a year. on the back of the box they say franchise debut but there is no franchise [....]
2,ALL-STAR 2002,ALL-STAR BASEBALL FOR NINTENDO 64 IS ABOUT 100 TIMES BETTER THAN THE ONE FOR PS2. IT WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.
4,Best Baseball Game,"This is by far the best baseball game for PS2. None of the others are even close. This game has so many options and different set ups. It is a very fun game. The only thing i didn't like about it from the previous ASB's is that in emotional moments like a game winning home run, its kinda shrugged off. On the previous ASB's there would be fireworks and crowd noise, which is absent on the new ASB. The game is simply over now when an emotional moment occurs. Other than that this is an awesome game."
4,"Awesome Game, maybe the best for PS2!",Great game I play it all the time. I was either gonna get triple play or all-star and boy am i glad i got all-star after reading reviews for it and seeing graphics. maybe a couple things could be better but overall it's one of the best game for PS2
1,Tricked!,"After reading everyone's reviews, I went ahead and bought this game. The starting menu's are vague and difficult. Trading players is awful. Granted, when I started my first game, as the visiting team, and my leadoff batter came to the plate, I thought they had made up for it. The detail was amazing, but batting was uncomfortable. Then, when it was my turn in the field, I was shocked. It was like I was playing Bases Loaded for Nintendo! What is with these camera angles? How come my Left Fielder is catching balls a good 10 feet away from him without diving? Why doesn't the computer ever take a freaking pitch? All this leads me to new questions: When will MLB 2K2 come out? This game is horrid, save your money."
5,Best Sort game in stock,"All Star Baseball 2002 is the best game ever. You will not belive the game. It looks like your at a real baseball game. They have all the new players but not Ichro. Also, the statdium as such good detial that the fans are moving and in the ballpark that have waterfalls you see them good. Also, at Arizona Feild if you land a homer in the pool you see it in it. In this game the yankees have Mike M and Alfonso Sorino. You get evry palyer. I would say if you love sports (baseball the most) this is the right game for you."
4,"Fun, Inspiring, High Caliber !","To read about a hero, one who is bold, brave, wise, and unstoppable, read about Swoop. Swoop will remind you of all that is possible--of all you have yet to accomplish.Many thanks to Mr. Bernstein for writing Heart of a Pagan."
4,Alexander Comes to Iowa,"If you've never had an interest in basketball, stand back and let Swoop take over. You'll be blindsided by the story of this charismatic figure rocketing through sleepy Hoppo Valley, invoking ancient Greek heroes, scattering devotees and enemies in his wake.Because it's not really about basketball. It's about dedication to values and the vision that fuels that dedication--about aspiration and inspiration. As much spiritual leader as athlete, Swoop ignites conflicts that go far beyond the sports arena.The questions are philosophical: What deserves single-minded devotion? What is the proper object of worship? And always: Just how far will he go?You may agree or disagree--hell, there are things in here I'm not sure I agree with--but you'll be challenged and inspired.This is the kind of book that changes lives--not by ""consciousness raising"" or other such empty gimmicks, but by electrical discharge applied directly to the soul. Galvanize yourself. Read this book."
5,Enjoyable and Inspirational Reading,"If you like the spirit of Ayn Rand's ""The Fountainhead"", I think you will like this book.After reading it, one has no excuses but to vigorously andwhole-heartedly go after one's goals and ambitions. The main character, Swoop, shows the way.Much thanks to Andrew Bernstein for writing this book."
1,stay locc to the brain,"brotha, why you livin that life? season of the siccness was the dopest album ever and this is the exact opposite.keep it real and stay away from the commercial NO LIMIT sound. if you like brotha lynch don't buy this because it ain't him and the style has changed too much."
1,This album bites,"If there was a list of excuses for shutting yourself from the outside world, the album, No Face Killaz would top it. This incoherent bleak piece of tripe doesn't resemble any type of style or rythem. Nuf said."
5,Good stuff.,This new type material gasket has been in my pressure cookers for about 3 years....looks like it was put in yesterday....I have two for two separate pots...both are excellent....not cheap but they work and last well......will buy again.
3,Good but not lasting,I bought my new pressure cooker some time ago.For some undetermined reason the gasket failed and I had to replace it twice although I use it carefully.So far I hope I won't have to replace it again
5,Great,"After ""blowing a gasket"" , this is a great replacement for the old one. Pricey but worth it given the cost of replacement."
4,it fits my pot.,The OEM part is perfectly fit for my kuhn rikon pot. however it is pitty not last forever as the pot is lifetime warranty.
2,"more like ""meta-funkin'-digital""","This one and ""Looks could kill"" are two albums by the Mothers that I don't like much. Instead of physical, organic funk you get drum-machines, studio-effects and synthesized guitar sounds.This album is not a group-effort. Bits and pieces have been taken from previous projects ( see discography on their website ) and two songs are new versions of ""Like a negro"" and ""Give you all the love"". There are sixteen or some different musicians playing / programming on this record. Among them there's Omar Hakim doing a guest-appearance on REAL drums on ""If 6 was 9"" and when you listen to that you just want to smash every drum-machine on the planet ! Sorry, but this album is nothing more than a compilation of demo's to me ... give us the real thing next time !"
5,Love it!,"I love this stroller. I had purchase a cheap stroller for my son when he was a few months old and he had simply outgrown it. I have a small car and needed a compact stroller that could stay in the trunk all the time. This is definately it! It folds up compactly and with the 3-diminsional fold, it takes up a smaller radius of space. I love the way it steers and my son seems to think it is comfortable. The only cons I can find with it are that it doesn't sit up as far as I would like for it to and the brakes are hard to use but I am sure they will loosen up after a while. I bought the cheaper version and the only difference I can see between it and the $129 one is that there is no pillow or child cup holder. I may contact the company and see if I can order the cup holder simply for convenience sake."
2,I can't find drivers now!,"I bought this monitor because it was a top of the line model. Now I need drivers for XP, and the viewsonic website no longer even mentions this monitor. It's as if they want to forget all about it."
2,Disappointing,"Sega's re-imagining of their classic arcade title ends up being sadly disappointing, as Alien Syndrome comes to the Wii. Playing as gun-toting heroine Aileen, you blast your way through hordes of repetitive mutant aliens. What really hurts Alien Syndrome the most is said repetitiveness, and it comes in more ways than just alien blasting: from the level design to the combat elements, Alien Syndrome recycles itself from beginning to end. The Wii controls sort of work well when it comes to aiming and shooting, but it doesn't take long for pure boredom to set in. The RPG elements that are inserted don't really amount to a whole lot either, and actually seem as more of an afterthought for the most part. All in all, Alien Syndrome may seem like a little bit of fun at first, and it is for a brief time, but sadly wears down into an exercise in monotony. It may be worth checking out for fans of the original arcade game, but all others should avoid."
4,Great multiplayer coop,"It really reminds me of the Gauntlet games, which were great for their simplicity. You and some friends gather 'round and kick the snot out of an endless supply of baddies. The diversity of character development allowed in the game helps, too. Things get easier if you use some brains, which is always nice, but if you just feel like plowing through, it's more than possible. Playing single player really isn't the game's strong point, as it's too repetitive and the cut scenes are too lame to engage you. If you've got the controllers and the friends (even just one), this game is well worth your time. It may not be worth the money, though, due to the lack of replay value, so this is probably a rental."
5,RPG action shoot 'em up fans.,"I was searching for a good 4-player game and the told me about Alien Syndrome, that is an RPG, action, shoot 'em up game, I invited some friends to play and test the 4-player gameplay and we liked. Before buying the game I read some of the reviews in different wed sites, some say good, others is bad, but I like. I only recommend this game for RPG action shoot 'em up and this game is 4-player local, no online option."
1,Bad,"Bought this game remembering playing something similar years ago, however after 5 minutes taking the game back. Needless to say it is a frustratingly pointless game where one fights aliens with bad weapons. If you are looking at buying this realize there is good reason amazon only pays 50 cents to trade it in."
4,pretty good protection,"I really want a metallic cover for my Game Boy SP, but I settled for this leather one. I was carrying it in my pocket, and the serial number sticker was starting to fade, so I needed something quick to protect the finish. This cover does that while keeping the Game Boy relatively pocket-sized. The official Game Boy pouches, while having nice pockets for games, also make the machine too big for the pocket. My only real complaint was the wierd new leather smell, but that wore off very quickly.This is a good product and works like it's supposed to. I especially recommend it for adult gamers who like to play on the way home from work (I see lots of you on the subway.)"
3,it doesn't fit perfectly,"ultimately, I'm satisfied because it came in on time and it works. but it is such a tight fit the cutouts on the back aren't in quite the right spot.its fine though, I'm happy with it"
4,Great Material,"Good Material. It smells and feels like that expensive leather that is on a leather jacket. The smell is strong but it will wear away after the first couple of use. Otherwise, good product."
4,It's nice but it has minor issues,"I bought it to avoid scratches while still keeping a stylish look for my GBA SP, its nice and durable, a bit iffy to take it off or on. You have to take it off if you want to recharge seeing as there is not a good open hole for the socket(a flaw in my view). Other wise its good, my hands don't get all sweaty when I play, it looks nice and my SP is protected."
5,Head of the Class - Please Release on DVD,Head of the Class was one of the best sit coms ever.When will it be released on DVD?There are lots of us out here who will buy it as soon as it comes out.
2,Good but not durable,"I bought this monitor 3 years ago for my home pc. It has a fantastic picture for the money. The only problem I have is that it just died on me the other day. Apparently I am not the only one that has had this issue with Viewsonic monitors. I have read a few reviews that state after two to three years their monitor started giving them problems. I don't know if these incidents are isolated or not, but I think I will steer clear of the Viewsonic name."
3,Big Waves,"The previous reviews about the movie being all about the waves is correct. The plot was quite boring. Definitely, a ""Grade B"" movie. But the waves were quite nice. Although, filming isn't very good, and it's quite obvious the stars of the movie were not doing the actual surfing."
2,Bad movie but makes you laugh,"Even though this movie may be bad, it's pretty funny and has bad acting that will make you crack up. If you're looking for a good laugh buy it!"
5,Ride The Wild Surf,"In 1964 three friends went to the show to see a surf movie for the first time. We returned to see this movie over and over again, (7 times to be exact). Being young and impressionable we wanted to be like Fabian, Tab Hunter, and Peter Brown riding Big Waves in Hawaii and falling in ""Love"" with girls like Susan Hart, Shelley Fabares and Barbara Eden. This movie made our summer of '64 a fantasy summer, we went to the beach, tried to surf, listened to Jan & Dean, The Beach Boys and dreamt of the girls in ""Ride the Wild Surf"". By todays standards this movie seems ""Hokie"", but for three fourteen year old boy's in 1964 it was a movie and Summer to remember."
3,RTWS - Stellar Surfing Footage!,"Yes, Fabian cannot act. Yes, Shelley Fabares is a cutie. But it's the surfing footage that makes this film worth watching. No fancy vocab necessary to review this. Just watch it for the surfing: Waimea Beach! The Banzai Pipeline! The 30 ft walls of water! Huge bone-crushing tubes! Some of the best vintage surf footage in a non-documentary film. Also, 1960's teen angst on the beaches of Hawaii is hilarious. We should have had it so tough as teenagers! Enjoy!!!"
4,"""The Big Daddy Of Them All ~ You Either Have It Or You Don't""","Journey back with me to the simplier, more naive time of the early to mid-60's when all young men were supposed to think about was girls in bikini's, surf music and the perfect wave. Released in '64 'Ride the Wild Surf' belonged in that genre of movies that brought teenagers flocking to the theaters in mass. In my estimation it happens to be the best of the bunch, despite the fact that Frankie and Annette are nowhere to be found.What young girl would want to miss out on seeing Fabian, Tab Hunter and Peter Brown challenging surfings best and the waves of Hawaii in the quest to be the last man surfing. As for the guys, well how about Shelley Fabares, Barbara Eden and Susan Hart to wet you appetite?Don't be expecting Shakespeare. Be prepared for horribly cliched dialogue poorly delivered, lots of absurd posturing and totally predictable dialogue. It's a hoot!"
4,Awesome old beach blanket movie.,"I kept seeing this on tv, and it was just so funny and kitschy I knew I had to have it. Great little love stories, funny innocent 60s culture film, the surfing is obviously not the biggest element in this movie, but if you want a fun beach blanket-esque film experience, you are looking in the right place!"
3,Ride the Wild Surf is fun!,"This is a good old movie that was filmed in Hawaii so many years ago. It is fun to see all the old things in Hawaii and just listen to Jan and Dean again. Fabian isn't a great actor, but is fun to watch. Don't like Shelly Fabares with blonde hair, though."
5,Ride the Wild Surf of My Memories,This is one of the best surfing movies from the 60's!!! And talk about the cast being so very in at that time!!! It is right up there with the Gidget movie with Sandra Dee. We are lucky to finally get this in DVD and it will live forever!!! Very enjoyable picture of the times that were so simple.
3,Fun in the sun and surf,"This ain't Gone With the Wind or Citizen Kane but it's a fun romp in the surf of Hawai'i. It's a Beach Party movie with a serious edge. Great surfing footage and beautiful locations on the north shore of Oah'u make this film a treat for the eyes, not to mention the lovely Shelly Fabares and Barbara Eden."
4,Victorian Village Home,"My 3 y.o. daughter received this as a belated birthday present and she loves it. Our living room in our house is decorated Victorian with a pink Victorian loveseat and a globe, so she loved that this house has a pink Victorian loveseat and a globe in the living room.One issue though: this house is supposed to shut so that it can be carried. We can NOT get it to snap shut securely. As soon as you pick it up it pops open. So we have been wiretying it shut when she wants to carry it or take it places."
4,A Pretty Great Little Toy...,"My daughter received several of the Sweet Treats playsets for her fourth birthday.The playsets were bundled together, and purchased at a deep discount. If the toys had not been on discount, I may have not purchased them at first, since the houses and accessories were smaller than what I had truly wanted.However, I am glad that I bought them for her, there is a lot of attention to detail, with a variety of people and furnishings to keep the imagination going. The houses close up and store very neatly (a big plus for us) - and we are enjoying the sets so much, that I am anxious to buy her more.I recommend these sets to any mom in my situation - My daughter is beginning to outgrow the Little People sets (and I am tired of stepping over the large Little People buildings) and I did NOT want to go the Barbie route. I can see the Sweet Streets lasting for a few years, until my daughter is old enough to invest in an elaborate dollhouse."
3,Not for the Experienced ....,"This book is a summary of the DCN course taught by Cisco around the world. This course leads to the CCDA certification. If you have been working with Cisco for more than two to three years, just go and take the test. If you havent, get the book. If you just have to purchase one book, get Top-Down Network Design book."
4,Great book/tough reading,Great book but tough reading!! I read this book along with the Lammle study guide. I found that this book was a lot more inclusive of the material in the exam. DCN goes deeper into topics than the Lammle study guide and is a definite pick up if you want to safely pass the exam. It took me 4 weeks to read and prepare but that included a lot of hours during the week as well as weekends. I scored a 903/1000 on the exam. I recommend that everyone who takes this exam to take the time to thoroughly know the material and do not try to learn just enough to pass the exam...chances are you will fail trying.
4,Interesting exposure into Cisco Internetworking Design.....,Need CCNA background/knowledge to fully understand and thoroughly enjoy. For the DCN exam also read the appendices!!
4,Helped me pass the CCDA test.,"This book is good. I seems to be cut and paste from the old course material for the DCN. A lot of the glossary stuff can be found on Cisco's site. I used this book and other books to passed the CCDA test. I used Cisco's ACRC, Sybex's ACRC and hands on experience."
2,To much info left out of book,This book leaves out some major points you need to know about the test. I am disappointed in Cisco on this one. If they expect us to use their books to get certified they better write them that way. I passed but if you don't know much you won't with book. I would go with Todd Lammle
3,"Good quality, but different than Palm's original styli","I lost the metal stylus that came with my Palm Vx, and disliked using the plastic one, so I ordered these as a replacement, since Palm's own do not specify clearly whether they are made of metal. Well, they arrived and are made of metal, but they don't have a reset pin and the head is different and stands out of the side of the case by a millimiter or so; these differences contributed to the 3 star rating. The quality is less than the original metal stylus."
2,Why did Rick Wakeman pick such an awful singer?,"I loved Yes and Rick Wakeman and had the opertunity to them both. Rick is an accomplished keyboard player. Six Wives of Henry VIII is possibly the definative masterpiece of rock keyboard wizardry to date. But in my opinion Rick Wakeman as a soloist has done little since then. The DVD still shows that Rick can play and has lightning fast hands. But the main vocalist is horrible! Every time he opened his mouth I wanted to scream. Worst possible moment was his rendition of Starship Trooper. Jon Anderson can sing circles around this guy, as could just about anyone else. It is nice to see Rick's son following in his footsteps as he appears on this disc. All in all for Wakeman diehard fans only."
3,Man in the Green Chevy,"Although I have read all the books written by this author, can't say I would personally recommend it. It is not that well written in the mystery interest. I was interested in the setting and wanted to read more to keep the people in mind. Any one with a mind to read modern western, perhaps it will be in their line."
3,A Fine Story,"While this collection seemed to skimp on details in a few places, it was a nice read for someone still wanting more Sandman stories. However, the art is very nice, and appropriate for such a dark tale."
5,The Oldies are Back!,"These songs are classics of the late '90's and early '00's. These are the songs that my friends and I love. They bring back my favorite memories. Sleep-overs, parties, and my first school dance. I didn't think I had that many memories, I'm only 11!"
5,Excellent Pop Songs!,"Merry Christmas!Okay, I got this album as a Christmas gift. I was so excited, and then I put it on, and loved it! Almost every single songs is one of my favorite songs...ever! I love this album! It has huge pop songs from 1999-2002. They are all great. I wish it would be more pop, and less hip-hop and rock/punk! Except Britney, thank goodness she isn't on this album.I love this album and encourage you all to get it. Merry Christmas to all and to all a Merry holiday day!-BiLLy"
2,Born in East LA DVD,"I was expecting the entire movie that I have seen on TV before. I'm very disappointed. The DVD is missing some 27 minutes of the movie, including the parts where Cheech gets his wallet back proving he's an American and the chase leading up to the marriage on the float! The very reason I bought the DVD was to have the whole movie not some cut down version!"
2,Don't buy this version. It's edited!,"Don't buy this version of Born in East L.A. They cut out the last half hour of the film. Try finding a version with the original cover, that has Cheech Marin crossing the border through barbed-wire. Otherwise, I would give this movie a 5 star rating."
3,Great movie if it was complete.,"I bought the Goodtimes version used and was disapointed the end was cut. Ipicked up the Universal version and found out it was also missing the last part of the movie. 5 stars for the original version, 0 stars for these versions."
2,Born in East L.A.,"I have been waiting for some time to buy this movie because it was one of my all-time favorites when I first saw it on television. Waiting to see if it would appear at a discount price (about $5-$7)I decided to go ahead and purchase it. I was disappointed to find out that this version had the shorten-version that did not show the marriage on the float at the end of the movie. Only then did I learn this movie had two different endings. Regardless, since it was one of my favorites, I decided to keep it anyway."
3,Great latino film!,This movie is a great latino film. This movie had me laugh all the way through. This movie will be a chicano classic.
4,Awesome Movie,I've loved this movie for awhile and finally decide to own it. It's pretty obscure but very funny. Love Cheech and Chong <3
5,Nothins seems different.,"Ok so i now have both editions of this film.the out of print and the one i bought at best buy.Now the only difference between the 2 films are.the one i purchased at best buy is ONLY and i repeat ONLY 1 minute longer.Nothing is different in the film besides the lack of the 1 minute missing.Now the bad part about both editions.The end is what kills it.In the end of the original VHS version they actually show cheech and the girl getting married.That is whats missing from both of these editions.So if u dont mind missing out in watching the lovely female and cheech getting married then either edition will do.But if your looking for the whole movie with them getting married then id go look for a vhs copy of this film..In all i love this film.Cheech marin is one of my favorite actors of all time and i have every single film he's in ""along with tommy chong lol"""
4,Cheech at his finest!,"This movie starts out like most cheesy 80's movies but the movie actually ends up pretty good. Marin does an excellent job of writing and telling the true story through the eyes of Mexicans during the 1980's. The movie is very funny but at the same time tells a good message. I would recommend this movie to anybody wanting to see a movie without the usual violence and explosions, that will make you laugh and think at the same time."
3,about the dvd,Does the dvd have the ending? With Rudy going to his house to get his wallet. Then getting married on the float by an alternative priest?
3,'Born In East L.A.' (Universal Studios) Running time: 90 minutes,"In my humble opinion, 'Born In East L.A.' is a second rate comedy. Things start happening when Los Angeles native Rudy Robles (Cheech Marin - also directed the film) is sadly mistaken for an illegal alien. So, they try to deport him back to Mexico. He tries to contact his family, but his non-English speakin cousin Javier (Paul Rodriguez) cannot help him. There are several memorable / semi-amusing scenes here and there, but this movie is okay, just not great like many other patrons have said. Certainly not a classic - by any means. Cheech & Chong fans may get more out of it than I did."
2,REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS MADE,"THE MOVIE IS REALLY NOT SO GREAT, BUT IT'S REALLY NOT SO BAD EITHER. I GUESS YOU JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS MADE TO UNDERSTAND WHY IT ISN'T AS TECHNICAL AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN. THEY PUSH THIS AS A KID'S MOVIE AND MANY OF US SAW IT AS KIDS... DOWNRIGHT SCARY!!!!!"
4,An Outstanding Movie But Campy,"I'm a big fan of ""The Black Hole"" and I bought it the second day it came out! I love this movie, but there is one thing I hate about it. It is too campy. I know ""Star Wars"" had robots, but it wasn't campy! ""The Black Hole"" has 2 (count it 2) robots that look like kids' play toys instead of robots. Well on the other hand I suggest that you buy/rent this movie!"
3,It's for Children . . . Jeesuz,"This is more a commentary on the reviews than the movie it self. Yes, the dialogue is _very bad_. But it makes a lot of sense to an eight year old. More thought went into the screen play than many folks are supposing. Their problem: Here's a strange, somewhat dark story that we must market to both children (its Disney, not Touchstone yet) and their parents, with an emphasis on the parents. Worth two stars just for the all the ""death"" in a Disney flick . . . . I think I got into goth as a youngster because of this movie . . . [rueful grin]."
3,Rip off but good,"After years of this movie not being available ITS BACK and on DVD also.After watching a ADVANCED copy of this on DVD (yes i have connections) I realize how much of a rip off this movie is on 20,000 legues under the sea and 2001.But for the time period this movie is visual amazing remember we are talking before digital effects like we see now.True the story is good and some dialoge very bad and some acting bad it is still a timeless movie and deserves respect and a look at.I applaude Acher bay for picking up this title from Disney who did not want to have anything to do with a re-release.Its a great old sci-fi movie and the kids will love it too."
5,Blast to the Past!,"Wow! I had totally forgotten about this movie, Untill I wanted to purchase TRON on Amazon. I purchased this and was immediately transported back to my youth! I reccomend all the older Sci-Fi movies! The person I purchased this movie from shipped it very fast and I got a great Deal!"
3,Pretty interesting ideas and set conveyed in a slow boring fashion,"The premise for this movie is good. Even the characterisation is not bad, however, the plot seems to have large periods of meandering without purpose. Having built a fantastic set, created a wonderful villain, the crew of heroes are fairly bland and characterless. Also some of the dialogue could be tightened. Not as fun as some other films from the era (Battlestar Galactica, Flash Gordon) but with an interesting premise. Definitely recommended for fans of 2001 - a Space Odyssey, although it achieves nothing of the intensity of that movie."
4,Deep In Space It Gets Even Deeper & Deeper!,"The Black Hole was Disney's attempt in 1979 to get on the space band wagon after the release of Star Wars in 1977. The movie overall has a slow pace. But because of the interesting visuals - its not a hard thing to watch.Technically it is a fantastic film. Peter Ellenshaw's graphics, illustrations and designs are wonderful. The ships are very detailed and the costumes - fit, but clever.The characters that stand out are Ernest Borgnine's troublesome personality as well as Yvette Mimoux. My favorite is by far, was the vocalizations of Roddy McDowell as V.I.N.CENT (Vital Information Necessary Centralized).The main bridge set was incredible and the robot Maximillian was very scary. The story is simple and not very detailed, but the movie overall was fun. The music is the best. A great score by John Barry. I loved the soundtrack.The DVD extra's are cool too. The behind the scenes with cast and crew are fun and detailed. This one is a must for the Sci-Fi fan."
4,AHEAD OF IT'S TIME,"Like most other reviewers- I havn't seen this movie in twenty years or so. I was suprised that the special effects did not look ""dated"" (the black hole, meteors,ect.) Maximilian the robot is terrifying. An all star cast and excellent special effects make this movie worthwhile. This will make up for the very disturbing and confusing ending."
5,"A magnificent, artistically arresting piece of hokum!","Forget the wooden characters, the ham-handed dialog, and the rather lame storyline. The SFX in the Black Hole come as close to an artistic vision as anything ever to come out of Hollywood.Keep in mind that this was the last hurrah for the same art and effects director who did the gloriously stylish and imaginative settings for Mary Poppins, Peter Pan, and Sleeping Beauty (I think...)Some of the bonuses... * Vincent Borgnine goes way out of usual character... * The malevolent droid is really quite scary... * Who cares about what happens to the good guys in the Black Hole! The kicker is what happens to the Madman and his cyber-goon. (An eternity truly worthy of Dante...)What's more...even the eerie, haunting, and chilling imagery depicting the final fates of all concerned are acceptable for older kids.It's hokum all the way through...but it's plied with true visual art. The musical score fires it all along."
4,Not that bad!!,"After reading some of the reviews here, I have to take a moment to remind everyone of what this was back in the day. This movie had one big problem....it came out after Star Wars. Had this movie come out prior to Star Wars, it may have been considered more of a success. I had no problem with the story or the special effects in this movie. Based on the time period, the effects were as good as they were going to get. Those who complain that you can see the wires on the robots are sitting too close to the television and are spending way too much time trying to find something wrong with a good movie. Bottom line is...this is a good movie that deserves to be viewed and appreciated. Word has it that a remake is being considered and that may satisfy those who have a problem with this version."
3,"I love sci-fi, but I don't love this film","Not to say I hate it either, but I've seen better sci-fi. I first saw this when I was eight years old, and even then, nineteen years ago, it didn't make much sense. Besides, since when are black holes BLUE!? Science is completely ignored, and the ending doesn't make much sense. Exactly where are the crew of the Palomino headed off to at the end of the film? Even though this black hole is blue, why does it suddenly turn red when the Cygnus is right near it? Great visual effects though, but movies such as ""War of the Worlds"" are a much better find."
4,Cool flick despite Disney-cutsey pollution,"This is one of the best science fiction movies ever. Too bad somebody got hold of the script and wrote in two cheesy robots, VINCENT and BOB. They are like floating tin cans with the generic over-sized ""Disney Eyes"" their animation people love to put on their characters. Well, the decision backfired. But the rest of the movie comes through, however. Just go to the kitchen and get a beer whenever the robots get the limelight."
3,It was great back in the day,"Nice to see this again but too bad they couldnt upgrade the video and sound, this should be remade or something."
4,campy classic,"The Black Hole has something that a lot of supposedly better movies don't - an original idea. That idea may have been too far reaching for it's day but even viewing again, decades later, it was enjoyable.Best of all for me - The robots. Still wish I had that Vincent model from when I was a kid. - sigh -You do have to overlook the inconsistencies - great visual effects then a minute later you can see the wires, and I think the actors did the best they could with poor dialogue. If you view it just for fun I believe you should enjoy it.Would love to see a remake."
2,A remake of Dr. Strangelove,"Okay, it isn't, but Bob's voice sounds just like the guy who rides the bomb. And that's one of the few redeeming features of this movie. It has so many problems: the irritating, platitude-spouting robot Vincent; the distracting musical cues; the muddled theology and incomprehensible ending, where we see ... <spoiler warning> ... hell? and heaven? (Maybe the movie is a remake of Dante's Inferno--would that make Vincent Vergil?). Not to mention the wooden acting all 'round, the inappropriate ""slapstick"" moments involving the robots, and the collapse of the plot halfway through the movie, resulting in character behavior which makes no sense. The picture quality was decent, though, except during some f/x sequences where the picture seemed choppy or in jerky slow motion."
2,Looks like it was made in 1969,"After watching this one on TV recently I came away thinking I had found the source of George Lucas' inspiration for Star Wars: the stormtroopers, R2D2, and even the theme song of Star Wars appear in this hokey film. I am now astounded to see that it followed Star Wars. Made in 1979? Unbelieveable! I thought it was dopey but attributed that to its ""age,"" but now realize that Disney should never have released this dog."
2,Twenty thousand light years under the universe,"1979 ... let's see, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, METEOR, MOONRAKER, BUTCH & SUNDANCE THE EARLY YEARS, THE FRISCO KID. Ok, not exactly timeless classics. It also brought this very, very strange and dark entry from Disney. Incredible work by Peter Ellenshaw on this intended space version of Verne's classic. Two stupidly ""cute"" robots -- the voices of Roddy McDowell and Slim Pickens. My sharpest memory of this movie upon seeing it at a theatre at the time was, ""Jeez, I can't believe it was only 90 minutes! It seemed like forever!"" The ending, I guess, is some strange play on 2001. Good cast but stilted dialogue undoes everything. I'm not saying this movie is the worst thing ever done. Hardly. But Disney touted this as their modern 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and Schell's character as a modern Nemo. It just doesn't make it. It does have a terrific cast: Schell, Ernest Borgnine, Yvette Mimmiuex, Robert Forester, Anthony Perkins, Joseph Bottoms. A pity."
4,"Marvelous, but marred","For their big sci-fi to-do, Disney cloned Nemo with Morbeus (FORBIDDEN PLANET), and rendered a rather moody space opera that stands apart from an army of post-1977 STAR WARS ripoffs -- a true throwback to 1950s pulp SF. Compare Maximilian to Calaban, and the Cygnus to Altair IV, and BLACK HOLE's lineage is clear.As per the technical details, Anchor Bay has done their usual outstanding job of preserving this film. The sound is great, particularly the overture track. The effects shots are crisp and clear, a true credit to Syd Mead and Harrison Ellinshaw's moody designs. Unfortunately, many of the live action interior shots show color degradation in the traveling mattes, resulting in a clumsy appearance. Probably a result of the original positive this DVD was made from. Still, if you can ignore the clumsy dialog, silly V.I.N.C.E.N.T. robot (hey, it's Disney!), and just focus on the strong points, this is a delightful release."
5,Very underrated--I need help,"I think this is one of the most underrated movies ever. The dialogue is downright awful in some parts and some of the science is just downright wrong (how does Charlie get sucked out into space in the end, but manage to breathe and yell? ). However, it has an overwhelming presence the whole way through. From the insane captain, Reinhart, to the sentry robots, to Maximillian to the Black Hole itself, there seem to be insurmountable obstacles throughout the whole movie. It is a very dark and disturbing movie. I actually think this movie would have been much more recognized had it not been released by Disney. It isn't a typical Disney movie. Death is a central issue in this movie, unlike most Disney movies.(...)The end is wacky. I understand some of it, but hardly all of it. I'd like to learn what exactly it all means."
3,A must see for any Sci-Fi Fan!,"A very different and unusual movie. I remember when Disney released it in 1979 and my parents would not take me to see it due to it's dark and weird content. I eventually saw it a few years later on a cable movie station and watched it every time it came on. It's plot is weak but has interesting special effects for it's time. I believe it would have done better at the box office if it had been released before Star Wars. If you are looking for interesting special effects with robots and computers, then this movie is for you! Kinda like Scooby Doo and the gang in outer space. It does have some bad script writing and slightly humorous but boring comments, but remember it's Disney not Lucas' Star Wars. Get the Widescreen Version, dim the lights and pop the popcorn, you will enjoy it. Pay close attention to the symbolism with Maximillian and Dr. Rinehardt as it nears the end...."
2,I Enjoy a Good Sci-Fi Flick,"I thought that this movie had a lot of potential. Unfortunately it didn't seem to really live up to any of it.There were certainly a few good moments, but the movie certainly lacked action. It moved far too slowly. There were certainly ""some"" special effects but it could have used more. This statement is made taking into account the fact that the film was made in the days before computer-generated effects became as sophisticated as they are today.Overall, yeah, I'm glad that I saw it, but I'm certainly in no hurry to watch it again."
3,My mom wanted this!,"It's an older movie with so,so special effects. My mom loves it because it is one of the first scifi movies she watched. It does entertain if you are into older scifi."
4,Halloween Steampunk Scifi movie,"Loved this movie a lot as a kid! An old but great, well made sci fi thriller for kids that are more along the lines of Alien and Event Horizon without the pure evil and spilled gut. The set designs are awesome and inspiring, I made lots of legos of the main ship that I twisted to bits upon completion - simulating gravitational pull. The main ship looks like a mix between a Victorian greenhouse and the Eifel tower, filled with killer robots and zombie munks. Whats more awesome than that when you are 10?This movie is best enjoyed on Halloween I think.Watching it again as an adult, it looks very dated and cheesy, especially the dialog that comes out of the robot called Vincent. The ending is also weak but from what I heard, they made it up as they ran out of time."
3,a strange film,"this film was done just to get money out of the star wars hype and it shows that not much planning in a creating a good script was there. i would put it in the camp status, but it really isnt campy enough to laugh at. it just isnt that good a film."
1,Terrible waste of time and money!,Both for the creators of the movie and anybody who buys it. This movie is so bad that it is painful to watch. The only mystery is how could talented actors and special effect people produce something this horrible.
2,"A Futureistic 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea","When you look at the cover, you think it's about a fantastic trip into a Black Hole, and what they find inside, but it isn't. It's about a Nemo wannabe wanting to enter the Black Hole. I especially did not like the ending. Overall I would rate it:Story-3 StarsActors-4 StarsMusic-4 StarsEnding-0 StarsOverall- 2 StarsI am not insulting Disney, I think it came out just how ""they"" wanted it to. And, as with most Disney movies, the only PG part is violence. I liked the actors and the Robots, but other than that, it is a waste of money."
1,Sleeper of sleepers - Trust me,"I guess I'm spoiled. I've never thought this film had much merit except the beautiful visuals. Otherwise, sleep through it. The acting is cheesy because they had a cheesy script and no actor can improve atrocious writing. Forbidden planet didn't have many decent effects, but at least they had a decent story and some first line actors. Max Schell actually looks embarassed in places, look carefully."
1,Oh Come On...,"Disney needs to start releasing their *animated* features on DVD, not this piece of ... work.This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Ever. Hands-down One of the Worst Films Ever Made. Special effects are bad and cheesy, writing is similarly cheesy."
1,Excruciating,"Of all the things in my life I'd like to change the one that tops the list has got to be the last 2 hours. For some reason I decided to rent The Black Hole. Oh my god, it is so darn dull. I feel like my soul has been sun dried then eroded to dust by the wind. I'm near tears for wanting the time back. I had thought the movie was dull when I was a kid yet some evil force conspired to make me watch it again. Now my body feels like I'm in the middle of a life threatening flu."
5,a prequil for event horizen,"this was a movie that captured my imagination, as a kid i enjoy the action and effects. but now i see there was a lot more to it. there seems to be alot of the concepts for event horizen seem to be in it. heaven, hell a ship missing for years suddenly reappearing. i find this movie a masterpiece in it's own right. some excellent acting proformances and for it's time excellent effects. the only downside is disney yet again. a total lack of extras. but even with that limitation if you are a sci-fi fan then get this for your collection."
3,"Belongs in the ""Nice Try"" Dept.","The Black Hole, Disney's attempt to capitalize on the Star Wars phenomena, is full of cliches: cute robots, evil scientists, and square-jawed heroes.The film's saving grace is the premise; solving the mysteries behind a very interesting steller phenomenon - a black hole. I also like the movie's very non-Disney, surrealistic ending (shades of 2001).Sci-Fi fans will find something to like about Black Hole, but look into getting a re-mastered, letterbox version of this film. The Black Hole is no ""Blade Runner"", but it is pretty good."
2,UPDATE: It IS Closed Captioned,"All reviews I've read are on-spot here of this old Disney flick -- I enjoyed it as a kid and was happy to get it on DVD.[UPDATE] Went ahead and bought it anyway to watch with my kids and, lo and behold, it is indeed Closed Captioned (though not subtitled)."
5,A must-see for lovers of BAD sci-fi -- disney style,"Oh, my. . . this is bad. The writing is terrible, the effects are dated (but not bad) and the direction is just plain icky (same guy who did Gomer Pyle). You MUST see this movie to believe it."
2,The old version was much better,"The story was changed slightly, probably to make it more politically correct. The acting was no where as good as the old version. The songs were not very good.I was bored."
1,A FLOP!,"Don't bother wasting your money on this remake of the original 1968 release starring Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder! I don't think I have ever seen Matthew Broderick give such a poor preformance and sound so pathetically lame! Who the hell was the casting director! You could tell Broderick was trying sooo hard to capture every vocal inflection and nuance that Gene Wilder gave to the original film. Broderick came off as though he was 'acting' which is not indicative of a proffessional actor!He failed miserably at imitating the brilliant preformance that Wilder gave to the role!As for Nathan Lane, well.. kind of hit and miss,trying sooo hard to imitate Zero Mostel that he comes off as trying to do just that, but sounding like a lame duck! Hey Lane! Stick to animation voice-overs!The only actor that really did a decent job was Will Ferrel.His preformance was the only saving grace to this disaster of a remake!Thumbs down on this one! Thumbs way up on the original!"
3,I Could Not Look Away,"Leave it to Mel Brooks to ""produce"" a re-make of his own movie and milk us for a few more dollars. And yet, I could not turn away. The ""Springtime for Hitler"" song-and-dance number is catchy (I can't believe I just typed that). Nathan Lane and, to a lesser extent, Matthew Broderick both over-played their roles, and appropriately so.Musicals always seem to drone on too long which is why so few are ever produced these days. This one sustains a pace sufficient to keep my teenage daughter's attention throughout, and that's really saying something. While she probably would've given it four stars, I could not."
5,Pleasent Surprise!,"I happen to love Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick since The Lion King. Will Ferrell and Uma Thurman added something that I have never seen in them. It offered surprises around every corner letting you know that something else was going to happen real soon. The musical numbers are outstanding (even Uma and Will's accents were great.. even if it was for comedy pull), the costumes will floor you, and if you weren't able to see the original on broadway you will get a piece of the magic these two brought to the stage. Oh, and if you think you laughed through the movie, go to the outtakes. My sides are still hurting from laughing at the movie itself and then I made the mistake of doing the outtakes right after."
1,Doesn't Compare with the Original,"When I saw the original movie with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, I thought it was one of the funniest movies I had ever seen, and became one of my favorites. I looked forward to the new version, having really loved the movie versions of Phantom, and Chicago.I was extremely disappointed. I thought Nathan Lane was great as Max and Wil Ferrel as Franz, Debris and Carmen Gia were okay but the rest didn't work for me at all. It was boring, slow and not funny. I can see how it worked well on Broadway, since a live performance is a different experience, but as a movie, why watch this when you can watch the original?"
2,Yuck,"As an enormous fan of the original, I was thrilled to hear that, of all movies deserving remakes, 'The Producers' was getting the treatment. Upon viewing of this movie, I was shocked to find that the movie is barely enjoyable. With the exception of Nathan Lane's great take on Zero Mostel's character, the casting is terrible (icluding one of the most irritating comedic actors of all time replace the fabulous Kenneth Mars). Will Farrel, Uma Thurman, and Mathew Broderik are all overrated and, in this movie specifically, bring nothing to the table actually bringing down the movie signifigantly. Fans of the original beware, this is nothing along those lines."
1,Failed to see any humor in it,"I don't see what is so funny about it. I didn't find it distasteful, I understand that it was supposed to be a joke. It just wasn't funny. Perhaps I'm missing something, but my guess is that a lot of people share my sentiments. Good dancing, but even the singing wasn't all that great."
4,He's having a stroke.... OF GENIUS!,"This musical was so succesful with the Broadway community but the movie community just doesn't seem to like it. Perhaps they've forgotten how to appreciate musicals. There once was a time when movie musicals were the biggest thing in Hollywood... everybody loved them and they swept all of the major awards at the Oscar's. But now the movie going public just doesn't seem to appreciate them. Here is a movie that's really funny, looks great visually has goods songs (although definetly not the best)and the critics and movie goers just don't seem to like it. But I'm here to tell you that it's very good. Plus, it's just great to see a musical on the big screen... it's been forever since Hollywood made a real movie musical. Go see it, you'll enjoy it a lot... it's an utterly unique experience."
4,okay,"Arrived one day later than Amazon had told me. Packing fine...disc plays as expected. Movie worse than expected....Had to pull out old VHS to see Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder and Dick Gautier."
2,A poor attempt to make a movie from a fabulous show.,"I just love the show and have enjoyed the music from it for some years now. I'm sorry to see the movie because I found it very ""slap-stick"" and although some of it was memorable, in general I felt it did not measure up to the previous DVD of ""Producing the Producers"" which I enjoy frequently."
5,Love It!,This is one of my favorite Broadway to Movie performances! Everything from the sets to the performers is absolutely perfect!
1,Not everything needs to be remade!,"The Producers was perhaps one of my favorite commedies of all time. The new version falls flat on its face.Broderick = Wilder, hardly. Broderick is talented but just can't do the part as well. Wilder could make you laugh just from his facial expressions.Lane = Mostel, no way! Zero was a classic comedic actor. He seemed real in the part. Lane is a great actor and I like his work in most films, he just can't be Max.The rest of the cast is just weak in this.If you did not grow up seeing the original, then this movie might work for you. I know my kids seemed to enjoy it, I could not make it all the way through."
1,Worst movie ever,"The original ""Producers"" was a pretty funny movie for its time. If its humor was somewhat broad, juvenile and singularly New Yorkisch it still contained a good number of laughs and was a lot better than most American comedies then or since. This 2005 remake takes the cake as the worst ""comedy"" and ""musical"" I've ever seen. There was literally nothing funny about this movie. I wanted to vomit every time I saw the unbearably bland Matthew Broderick or the creepy queerNathan Lane, neither of whom were right for their respective parts. For some reason, the powers-that-be completely wrote out Lorenzo St. Dubois and his very funny solo, in order to give Will Ferrel more screen time, and added a mess of unmemorable and unfunny musical numbers to the script that made this excruciating dreck even longer than it had to be. And somehow a lot of obviously very culturally deprived people found this thing funny."
2,The Producers,"If you find it in China, it might interest you to turn on the subtitles. They're from a completely different movie. Some fool with a videocamera in the theatre made this, and the audio is challenging. I watched until the bit where Nathan Hale hung himself on the clothesline, which is right up there with a Three Stooges DVD I don't like, and then I gave up. I suspect the real version is much better."
3,Not as good as the original.,"Do yourself a favor and watch the original ""Producers"" on DVD. In disagreement with one reviewer below, Matthew Broderick puts on a good show but doesn't compare with Gene Wilder's Leo Bloom. The original wasn't as much of a ""musical"" as the new one, but more of a comedy. An overall fair movie but the original gets five stars."
3,Lane saves the day,"*formatted edition*The translation of an outrageous burlesque-style movie with music about a Broadway musical to a real Broadway musical to a movie musical can't be easy, though Nathan Lane is superb throughout; Will Ferrell has alot of strong scenes as the author of ""Springtime For Hitler""; the art direction is excellent; and the script has intelligence, for the most part successfully adapting legendary dialogue.Lane's partner, the usual dependable Matthew Broderick, is surprisingly amateurish, though he sings well. He doesn't seem to believe in the role, coming off like a community college theatre hack.Most songs are pretty good; some are meaningless and should have been cut.The difficulty is that lovers of the '68 will not love a version that is not perfect. On the other hand, such fans may enjoy hearing classic lines repeated.Final scenes are superfluous.[Brooks fans will enjoy hearing his voice on a production number and a great line from ""High Anxiety""]."
4,A riot!,"An absolute riot! I laughed the whole way through. Will Ferrell is at his comedic best in this. The music numbers are well choreographed and sung, overall a really fun film. This movie always brings a smile to my face."
3,DVD Version has been editied,"I saw this in the theater, and as I was watching the DVD I notice that some scenes were cut from the DVD:Max and Leo meet in the hall of Max's office building.Bar Scene with Max and Leo and Bar Guset."
5,The Producers-The musical,This film is one of the most enjoyable I've ever seen or owned. Mel Brooks is a comic genius.
3,Disapointed,PLay and Original Zero Mostel Version were better. I was disappointed in this rendition of the script.
4,New Interpretation of a Classic,"OK. No, this is not as great as the original with Mostel and Wilder. It is a musical interpretation of that original, which was an often brilliant classic of silly slapstick, over the top acting, and poor taste (read Ebert's review of each film). I thought the musical numbers were well staged and directed, and the songs were deliciously vulgar and witty. The stars reprise performances honed on Broadway, and Uma Thurman was a nice surprise as a musical performer. If you like musicals, and if you laughed at the original, you will enjoy this film. If you haven't seen the original be aware that it is not for everyone (Brooks's humor is not to everyone's taste), but it made me laugh loud and often. Either enjoy this for what it is, or don't watch it. Enough with the complaining, already."
5,Simply the best!,Mel Brooks has done it again! This is by far one of his best works ever; it's the best musical comedy ever done! Definately a movie one will enjoy watching again and again.
3,Great work (for a musical),"I hate musicals, I absolutely despise them. The singing and dancing gibberish makes my head spin. Ordinarily I would pass right by one of these films in the video store except this particular musical cost me a mere dollar to rent. I am a fan of nerotic producers and provacative blondes so I decided to give it a shot. To say the least I didn't vomit at the sound of show tunes showering through my thirty inch telivision set, I must admit it was a fairly good film. Will Ferrel shines as a radical neo-nazi, the gay jokes are poured on thick and Mathew Broderick is a complete socially inept freak. The acting was good, the singing was withstandable and Uma Thurman was ravishing. Not one of my favorites, but it is by far my favorite musical."
4,Over-the-top fun!,"The premise of this movie-turned-play-turned movie is that a producer can make more money with a flop of a play than he can with a hit. This plan is proposed by accountant Leo Bloom, played by Matthew Broderick, to producer Max Bialystock, played by Nathan Lane. The flamboyant producer teams up with the nerdy accountant and they proceed to put together the worst show ever seen on Broadway. Dreams of million dollar profits are dancing in their heads when--wonder of all wonders--the show is a hit! All of the performers are over-the-top and funny and this movie is a hit, as well. It makes for a great evening of entertainment."
2,I hated it,"This version of ""The Producers"" isn't good enough to make a patch on the original film version with Zero Mostel. Save your money, folks."
2,as bumpy as a bad highschool play,"I was quite excited to see this movie as I usually enjoy both Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane, and I was very disappointed. It is the worst movie I have seen in ages. I realise that they attemped to capture the feel of Broadway, but it just felt amaturish. I am sorry that I wasted both time and money."
2,What a disappointment,"I was really excited to see this movie. I was looking forward to it a month a head of time. The idea of Nathan Lane and Matthew Brodak sounded incredibly funny. But it was the exact opposite. The story is about Max(Nathan Lane) and Leo(Matthew Brodak) trying to become rich. They cheat older women out of money and find anyway to get a buck. The laughs were scarce, and the movie felt way to long. I hope Nathan Lane and Matthew Brodak try again at another movie, because this one made them look awful."
2,Disappointed and then delighted,Have used Amazon manny times and been delighted. Ordered this dvd not realising that different regions in the world have different 'settings' for playback on dvds and once received I was unable to play this dvd at all.... BUT - returned item and system worked brilliantly. I received total refund inc cost to return item. Bottom line is that I have total confidence in Amazon and would use them for any purchase without any reservation. Thank you Amazon.
2,"In a word, trite...",Watch the original with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder and see if you don't agree - this is a trite remake.The songs are just dreadful - the only decent ones being those lifted from the original movie.Lane gives a good performance through not as sleezy as Mostel's. Uma is just great! Broderick never seems to find his character.So glad I never saw it in the theater.
3,"""The Producers"" Movie is ok but very stagy","Broadway shows don't often lend themselves well to film. Unfortunately, ""The Producers"" is one. I saw the show on Broadway and I thoroughly loved it. I saw the movie and was not very thrilled. The movie does give a good impression on how the play was, except for the cut sequence ""King of Broadway"", which is on the Deleted Sequences on the DVD.Works like ""The Producers"" play better in the theatre than on film. Being part of the audience reaction is key to the entertainment value of this show too. I would have much preferred a DVD of a live performance at the St. James Theatre in New York. Stage plays on video are still not like being there, but they give you a idea of ""being there"" and how the show worked.It's simply is a matter of some pieces work better on film than on stage, and vice versa."
3,"Good, but not like Broadway","Mel Brooks' original Producer's (Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder) was great fun... one of his better movies. The modern Broadway version with Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick was equally fun, and had its own unique charm that played well to a theatre crowd. The movie however, though good in formula, lacks the same charm as the stage production. Things seem a bit more forced and don't translate as well when the camera is shoved up the actors' noses, and location shots aren't always better (ie the missing ""Little Old Lady Land""). Also, though I love Uma Thurman, I really missed seeing Cady Huffman in the role of Ulla... her stage performance was flawless! It's a real shame that 'star-power' still has so much influence over casting."
5,"Wonderful CD, wonderful singer","""Abandon"" is easily one of the best CDs I own. It's one of those rarities on which every single song is worth listening to. The tunes will play in your head over and over again and you won't be able to get enough."
5,In a category of his own,"I've been a fan of Jason Morant for several years now and have been to a few of his concerts. Each time I leave with a handful of copies of ""Abandon,"" just to make sure I have great gifts on hand when I need them. This is one of my favorite CDs, if not the favorite of all time. Jason Morant's ""sound"" is indescribable and unique, he takes his influences and throws them asside to create a genre of his own. I'm not trying to sell anything here so I'm not going to swoon, but this is a deep CD, the kind you must worship to; if you have a heart that is set on the Lord, you should get this, even if only for that reason."
5,Great Album,I got my first taste of Jason Morant at Aquire the Fire in Dallas. In his music you can truely feel his heart. He perofrmed some of the songs from the album and I purchased the CD rigth away. I Am Yours is a great song expressing Jason's devotion to God. His remake of Bless The Lord is another great track. This is a CD you can pop in and let it play all the way through.
4,The Bob Newhart Anthology,Over all it is very funny. There are parts that are hard to hear because of the way they recorded it. But the material is funny.
4,OK,"light-hearted; good for a lift; will consider purchasing more; this type of CD is great for older, more limited adults"
5,"""It might go...","something like this..."" With these words Bob Newhart, one of my favorite comedians, launches into one hilarious skit after another. Most of the bits here are every bit as funny as they were when originally performed, though a couple like ""The Man Who Looked Like Hitler"" or ""Rocket Scientist"" can seem dated. While I'm not opposed to the odd vulgarity (and I don't think that they either makes things funny or keep them from being funny), I enjoy the fact that Bob works so clean. It makes it possible for me to share something I really enjoy with both my older relatives (who would be offended otherwise) AND my younger relatives (who shouldn't be exposed)."
3,I expected better packaging,"The item was described as new. When I received the CD, it was clearly used because there was no shrink wrap on it. I was going to give this item as a gift. It looked more like I ""REGIFTED"" a used item."
3,"Mildly amusing, a little slow.","I have always loved Bob Newhart on TV, so I thought I would love this album, but I have to admit I got a little bored with it. His setup of an absurd hypothetical situation and lead in of ""I think it would go a little something like this..."" gets old after a while, and his material is a little dated late 1950s. If you want some really good clean funny timeless standup comedy audio recordings, go with Bill Cosby, especially ""Fat Albert"", ""Bill Cosby...Himself"", and ""Those of you with or without Children, You'll Understand."""
1,The Bob Newhart Anthology by Bob Newhart CD,The laugh track is distractingly and annoying loud (shrill) and Newhart's humorous monologue is far softer than the laugh track. Would not recommend this to anyone.
5,Simply the best!,"Simply put, the funniest comedic album out there! Mr. Newhart is the undisputed king of smart humor! A must have for every collection. 10 stars out of 5!"
5,As good as I remember it and in good quality B & W.,"Maverick was one of my favorite shows as a child, but sometimes what seems great as a child doesn't alway seem so great as an adult. What a pleasant surprise to find tha Maverick holds up well over the years. I will caution you that the first few episodes are 1/2 hour and they are not nearly as good as as the later hour long episodes - more time to develop story, charactor, etc. James Garner's charm and aptitude for humor, as well as script, acting, and sets make this one of the most enjoyable shows of that time era. With all the positives It's easy to over look the occasional ridiculousness (like shooting the gun out of someones hand) that was the norm for TV westerns of that time period."
3,Single Channel,"If you watch this product with headphones like I do, beware it only is heard on one side. There is nothing available to split the single channel signal so it can be heard as a standard mono signal would be."
3,"Basic"" Maverick""","I have some good memories of ""Maverick"" from the early 60's though my favorite series at the timewas a toss up between ""Cheyenne"" and ""Sea Hunt"".My dissapiontment with this release was simply that there was little difference with thisand a previous release {perhaps by the almost partially democratic Communist Chinese}This 1st season of ""Maverick"" has no extras except you can access the written words of the scriptin French, Spanish and for the hearing impaired English.The one positive being a folded sleeve giving a short mention of each episode,so the 3 stars are simply indicitive of a release that could have been done better if some of theimput had been done by someone who cared just a little bit about ""Maverick""."
5,Outstanding,This show is so darn good it makes you wonder whatever happened to good television programming. Let's please have the remaining seasons -- and then WHERE are seasons 2+ of Murphy Brown??? Come on!
3,maverick first season,THE ABOVE TV SHOW AS DISCRIBED BY AMAZON STATES THAT THR SHOW IS IN COLOR. THIS IS NOT CORRECT IT IS IN AS THEY SAY GLORIOUS BACK AND WHITE. HAVINGTHOUGHT THAT THEY HAD COLORIZED THE DVD I PURCHASED IT. YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT I WAS UPSET WHWN IT ARRIVED IN BLACK AND WHITE. I WILL KEEP IT AS I MISSEDSOME OF THE ORIGINAL AIRINGS. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PURCHASING ANY OTHER SEASONS UNLESS THEY ARE IN COLOR. ONE HAS TO DRAW THE LINE ON PURCHASES AND MINEIS NO BLACK AND WHITE.AMAZON SHOULD APPOLOGIZE FOR MIS-LEADING BUYERS
4,Maverick,"I liked this show when it originally aired, and still like it now. It is one of my favorites shows, much better than what is being made today."
5,Fantastic!,I love the original Maverick! James Garner is the best! I highly reccommend this. This is one of the best western series ever made.
5,What's taking so long?,"Come on, Warner Brothers, what's taking so long?Most of the best TV shows of the fifties and the sixties have been released in complete season sets, remastered and in beautiful transfers -- but Maverick, one of the best shows of all time, remains unreleased.Well, it's about time, all right? Warner Brothers, the world is passing you by. Most of the first season can be found by assidious searchers on the Internet -- in distorted, godawful form, from videotapes recorded by dedicated tapers years ago. But why force us to watch bootlegs when the real thing lies in studio vaults?Maverick isn't just the legend of the West, it's probably the only show of the fifties/early-sixties western craze that remains watchable today, with a true antihero -- a guy who really doesn't want to play the hero and get his head blown off in the bargain (but who usually winds up playing the hero despite himself).Anyway, it's about time this one came out on DVD. So how about it?Erik SmithSpokane, Wash."
4,Good for small wrists!,"I really like the look and feel of this watch. The actual color of the face is in between some of the pictures I've found online, neither as grey nor as brown as some make it look.Also, because it has a leather band, I was able to punch a hole so that it fits well on my small wrist."
3,Breyer dressage arena,"I expected more for the lofty price. Purchased this item for my grandaughter who is learning dressage on her own horse. She is 7 years old. It's a good learning tool, but the price was a little high for this item."
4,The Baltimore Rowhouse,"The Baltimore Rowhouse provides an insightful retrospective of the growth of Baltimore City over a 200+ year period by analyzing the houses which its residents built and occupied. It chronicles the birth of a city and describes its growing pains in accomodating its increasing population. Being a lifelong resident of Baltimore and having a personal knowledge of the neighborhoods described in the book, it was especially fascinating to me. I was able to match my own knowledge with the historical background provided by the authors. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to understand the growth and evolution of a typical American City from the perspective of its townhomes."
3,The history of the city as told by its houses,"I enjoyed the pictures of these houses, and thought the book was especially well written. It's impossible to separate the evolution of these houses from the changes in the city itself, so some history is inevitable; there is also a great amount of detail involving the lives of the owners and developers. If you are not overwhelmed by all this, you will uncover some interesting bits: the ads for Formstone, the fact that basements were hand-dug by a crew of nine in two days, the tales of the ""night soil"" removers. Really concentrates on the local history, though, so it may not of interest to others."
4,Fine brushes however...,"The brushes look great, feel great and suit my needs - however what concerned me is the state in which they arrived. They're essentially tied to this flimsy piece of cardboard with little elastic bands. Two of the brushes had slipped free of these (not-so-tight) securings and managed to get wedged against some of the other brushes. Normally even THIS wouldn't have been a problem, however the plastic brush protectors had also slipped off these two brushes and had the bristles looking fairly rough when I removed them. Fortunately they weren't permanently warped and I couldn't notice any appreciable bristle loss. Packaging aside however, these are very nice brushes."
2,Sheds,The brushes were ok but the largest shed badly and was more trouble than it was worth to use.So I would not recommend this set
1,Don't waste your money,This so called video is just a collection of video clips set to repetitive music with 2 guys talking all the way through. Don't waste your money. Most of it is filmed in darkness and you can't really see much except blurry lightning shots.
2,Could have been five stars.,"I have loved thunderstorms since childhood. This DVD could have be five stars, but,really, the thunderstorm is the music. Adding a music track (and a poor one at that) just completely ruined the DVD for me. I couldn't even get through the whole DVD.I would have rated it no stars, but I gave it two in case there's someone out there who isn't offended by the lousy music track."
4,High Notes & Broad Range,"This album is a fine addition to my collection. The cover touts Karen Lundry's ""very high A flat"" and when she hits that note it is hard not to soar along with the music. But the ""very high A flat"" is a small part of the album and understates its appeal. The music gently strolls through several languages and as many genres yet, amazingly, holds together as a cohesive whole. I didn't like every track but am impresed by and delighted with the album."
3,Ok underproduced album,"The merits of this album are in the songs.. Choose Your Masks and Farenheit 451 being prime examples. Dream Worker is also an inspired musical/mood song. So what's wrong?Basically the production! Almost every song has a superior live or studio version available officially or unofficially! Having said that I would describe this as ""easy listening Hawkwind"" so if you want a gentle introduction to the band in the 80's this might suit you."
4,The last true Hawkwind album.,This album marks the final adventures of Uncle Bob (Calvert) and the good Doctor (Dave Brock).Although not the best album by the band it is a ftting reminder of what a good song writer Bob was. To me the album is spoilt by the influence of Harvey Bainbridge - who's dreadful keyboard work would ruin many more Hawkwind albums before his belated departure from the band in the early 90's. Worth a listen for die-hard Hawkfan's only - 1977's Quak Strangeness and Charm is the best starting point for any casual listner - if you get past the first 60 seconds of static/pink noise.
3,GREAT COVER!,"It's quite understandable to see why HAWKWIND took a break afterthis album. This is easily one of their most uninspired and leastexciting albums of the 80's. As other people have pointed out,theproduction is not that good, but it's the songs themselves thatare disappointing, especially Dave Brock's songs, like the titletrack and ARRIVAL IN UTOPIA. Also, HUW LLOYD-LANGTON overplaysthroughout the entire album, which is part of the reason thatHarvey Bainbridge's nifty little synthesizer tunes DREAM WORKER,VOID CITY and THE SCAN are my favorites songs here.HUW's twosongs, WAITING FOR TOMORROW and SOLITARY MIND GAMES are ratherlistenable, but did HAWKWIND really have to re-record SILVERMACHINE? This is easily my least favorite tune on the album, thanks in part to HUW's mindless guitar playing.The cover, however, is one of HAWKWIND's best and is what prevents me from giving the album just two stars!"
2,French film about gay experience,"I love it that the French consistently decide to release films made by a whole bunch of film-makers. One which really works is PARIS, JE T'AIME. This one on the large doesn't deliver, though Marion Cotillard fans will love""The Sea Gull,"" a brief look at lesbian love. Man, does she know how to cry and make us believe her pain!"
1,And now a public service announcement,"Jeez! What a WASTE of time. A dozen or so 5 min. ""public service announcements"" for safe sex. Unless you want to brush up on your French, forget this collection of ""nothing"" films."
1,barely covered the seat. Steering wheel cover didn't fit at all,"First of all, the steering wheel cover was too small, even though my Subaru classic wagon had a very average sized steering wheel. The covers themselves did not fit very well and within months the drivers side cover was tearing due to flimsy material. Considering that they were pretty pricey, I don't think they held up well considering the cost."
4,Strong Compilation,"A great compilation, but it'd be hard to fail, with such a great catalog to choose from."
5,Great Anthology Of Tom Petty's MCA Years,"ANTHOLOGY: THROUGH THE YEARS is a great collection of the material that Tom Petty did, both with the Heartbreakers and as a solo artist, while he was on MCA. If you want the two great songs from the otherwise disappointing SOUTHERN ACCENTS, get either this collection, or, if you don't want the original albums, the boxed set PLAYBACK. This set is a lot cheaper than the box, and includes a new song, ""Surrender"", as well as the hits from all of Petty's MCA albums. In other words, if you have all the original CDs except SOUTHERN ACCENTS, you need this one for the good cuts from that disappointing (but not terrible) album. Petty's opposition to Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this double-disc set an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
5,Anthology,"This album is probably the best place to start in your love affair with Tom Petty. Once you hear his music there's no going back. He has a wonderfully distinctive voice and can play both rocking upbeat songs, as well as laid back chilled out ones. There are so many brilliant songs on this compilation, it would be hard to pick out any one for special mention. Needless to say I highly recommend it!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Another botched remaster,"The song selection should be good for a casual fan like me but I give it two stars for the remastering quality for an average of three. Chalk this one up to the growing list of poor remasters, a list that includes recent compilations by some big names such as Pearl Jam and The Who. Like those remasters, this Tom Petty Anthology plays harsh, brittle, and thin and the midrange has been swept under the rug. To be fair, the previous one-disc Greatest Hits compilation wasn't all that stellar in the sound quality department either, but it was easier on the ears than this mess.The people below who've commented on the ""superb"" sound quality have likely been swayed by the crispness of the over-cranked treble. Try listening to Free Falling at medium high volume for more than ten minutes and tell me if you don't get a headache from it. Someone please remaster this again: smooth out the treble and bloom out the midrange a lot more. The bass seemed fine to me."
3,Could've been five stars,"Not a bad Greatest Hits compilation but no Tom Petty Greatest Hits could possibly be complete without his phenomenal work from Wildflowers. Although some fans and critics don't fairly assess Wildflowers, it is actually one of Tom's best offerings. The rhythm section is the best its been in years. The follow ups of the soundtrack to She's the One and Echo aren't bad either. In fact, while less consistent than Wildflowers, Echo has some of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' most innovative work in years while still playing close to the bone on trad rock. So, in conclusion, this Greatest Hits package ain't bad... but it ain't the greatest either... more like an overview of nostalgia."
3,"Splendid music, but the avarage fan has it all already.","The songs in this collection are absolutely marvellous, but there is a slight problem - I have almost all of them already. A few more unreleased ones would be nice - a lot of Mr Petty's fans have these ""unheard"" ones as bootlegs already. If you don't have much from this great musician, by all means buy this, you'll get a good overview. But it might not be worth the outlay for any long term fans - especially as I feel this ground has already been covered by the ""Playback"" boxed set a few years ago."
2,Flimsy and small,"This tool box is worth maybe $50.00. I paid $129.99. Look at the actual size dimensions before you buy it as it is smaller than most 6 drawer tool chests. The drawers and bottom cabinet are flimsy and feel cheap. If you don't push/pull the drawers from the middle, they won't come out or go in straight. If I had to do it all over again, I'd spend more and get a better tool chest. I would not recommend this as a fathers day, birthday or Christmas gift."
3,"Stack-On SC-600 6-Drawer Chest/Cabinet Combo, Red","When I received the first unit, there was a large gash in the shipping box and I could see that the unit inside was badly dented. I contacted customer service and they were great - they sent out a replacement unit immediately, and I got it a few days later. Unfortunately the second unit was also dented. I didn't bother returning that one because I had already spent 45 minutes putting the unit together before I saw the dented drawer. This was a present, so it was disappointing to have to give a dented present in the first place, then take it back to return it, then replace it with another dented unit. But customer service was GREAT!! Can't stress that enough. I'm sure if I would have called about the second dented unit, they would've been just as helpful. So I can't complain that it wasn't replaced."
2,horrible build quality,"i bought this thing after reading some of the negative reviews, thinking to myself - how bad could it really be, it's just a metal box.well... pretty bad. there is a metal rim on the bottom portion, around the top. it was so bent that i had to straighten it with pliers before the top portion would fit. the drawers might as well be plastic, and barely fit. i'm afraid of having any heavy gear in there, because it's liable to fall through, or dislodge the drawer from its hinges.stay away."
2,Buy more or less,"Worth what you pay, but you will likely be unhappy in long run if you don't pay at least $500 for something like this. So, my advice is to buy something smaller (such as, say, aStanley Consumer Storage 512100 12-Inch Tool Bagand/orStanley Consumer Storage 512100 12-Inch Tool BagorStanley Consumer Storage 020800R FatMax 4-in1 Mobile Work Station for Tools and Parts) until you can afford more. Then, don't get anything less than theExcel TB2605X-Blue26-Inch Steel Roller Cabinet, Blueand it's associated toppers."
3,good for the price,"When we took it from the box, it was dented on the top of the bottom section, and the top edge of the bottom section was bent at the corner. The Top section was bolted inside the bottom section, so you have to take the thing apart to get the top section out. It's not a heavy metal, but will hopefully work for my daughter & her husbands needs. I guess it's a good value for the price."
2,So So.,It works well but smaller then I thought. A small child would enjoy it. I am 6ft so I have to been down to use it or put it on a wood stand to get it higher. Three more ft taller would be right.I saw one this week at Home Depot that was around $300. I liked. It was over 5 ft tall and could hold almost every small tool I have.I should have checked the size of the SC-600 6-drawer chest/cabinet Combo before I brought it. Shame on me!
1,why?,I paid 140.00 for this tool box and received it completely damaged on dec 13th. Then I call them and they tell me that they can't even get me a new one by christmas!!!! Thank you amazon for nothing!!!!!
5,Excellent treatise.,"I was finishing law school when I watched Barry Scheck's cross of Dennis Fung and I couldn't imagine being able to do that. Pozner and Dodd's book gave me the tool-tools that any attorney can use-to successfully build my case and cross any witness. This book is more than a book on cross, it's a book on how to build your case. You will understand how cross examination dictates case themes, factual analysis and trial strategies. The best legal book I have ever read."
3,not the best not the worst,The movie was somewhat different from the book the basic plot is the same but the very important details were overlooked. If you have the time skip the movie and buy the book
3,A strained plot but good performances,"Not a great movie, but still entertaining. I especially enjoyed the characters and performances of Travolta and James Woods. The nudity and S&M in the film is disturbing, as it was probably intended to be, but its so in-your-face that it threw me off from fully immersing in the experience, making me feel like I'd stepped into the wrong movie. Stowe was underused, her role as a romantic foil for Travolta forced. You have a pretty good idea who the bad guys are going to be by the middle of the movie, if not earlier, but there's still enough doubts and twists to keep you second guessing till near the end. I didn't like the same old portrayal of the military. From this film you'd think most of the officers are sexual or moral deviants without integrity or honor. But I guess it wouldn't have been much of a who-done-it if you can't suspect everyone. Watch the film, but don't let your expectations get too high."
4,More of the same from DeMille,"I'm a big DeMille fan, and I enjoyed ""Daughter"" thoroughly. However, if I had had to read one more trip down rifle range road, I would have put this one away. Good story, good suspense, maybe not the greatest ending.I cannot imagine a W04 in the army so sure of himself that he would talk to senior officers the way Brenner did in this book, and I cannot believe a W04 would ever have the authority on his own to grant immunity to a prisoner."
2,Not even close to being as engaging as the book,"This was a typical Hollywood job of taking an intricate well thought out plot and breaking it down into a nothing of a movie. This is sort of like getting sound bites from a Kennedy or Martin Luther King speech. My advice is to skip this movie, buy the book, and enjoy a great mystery."
2,far fetched with an agenda,"Good cast wasted on a typical anti-military plot. Sorry but I choose to believe that most soldiers are good, respectful men and women of honor. Yeah, they'll always be a few bad apples and a few cover-ups, but this story was ridiculous. I kinda got the direction this movie was going from the very beginning when the General told his listeners that ""nobody wins in a war"". Really? Tell that to all the men and women who sacrificed everything to defeat Hitler. If winning isn't the objective for going to war, what is? This movie was uneven, often confusing and of course they had to throw in a creepy sex theme to degrade the actress who played the murder victim. Getting tired of Hollywood's degradation of actresses for entertainment value. Bad movie."
2,very tough to watch,"Grant it I saw this movie on VHS when it came out in 2000, I was fifteen and definatly too young to see this movie. Please don't judge me or my parents! But ten yrs later this movie has stuck with me. I just can't get past the rape scene...its awful. And what's worse, is what her father did. Which was absolutly nothing,it was disgusting. As a woman and as a military member, I pray that something this awful wouldn't get cover up. Anyway the 'who done it'detective part was well done, but I can't see this movie again. Too difficult to watch. If you plan on purpchasing this movie please but aware that the rape scene is gruesome."
4,This held my attention,"Great cast here and James Woods plays his usual psycho to a T. Travolta really isn't bad here. I guess it's kind of standard to rip his recent movies, but this one has a decent plot with some cool twists. Based on a true story, but you don't find that out until the end. Pretty kinky stuff here."
2,NOT TOO GOOD CONSIDERING THE TALENT HERE...,"I knew this movie would have a lot of holes in it when, in the beginning, the title character changes a tire WITHOUT A JACK. Wow, if she could do that then the writers aren't paying much attention and, after awhile, neither was I. None of the people here are in the least sympathetic so we really don't care who did what and why. So the film meanders along with a few seemingly shocking developments but comes to a silly end to the relief of all. Everyone here is diminished by this one."
2,Quite disappointing,"After having read the book & the author's message on how he closely collaborated with the director & assured his readers that the movie would be closely patterned after the book, I though it would be nice to see the movie as well. Afterall, John Travolta is a good actor. But I was totally dismayed after seeing the movie. If I had not read the book, most of the scenes would not have made any sense. I should have just stuck to the book."
5,Alternative Ending is the Best!!,"In the special edition at the end of the tape, they show an alternative ending. It is much better than the original ending.As usual, Travolta stands out. He does an excellent job of portraying a Warrant Officer and puts military, officer B.S. in its place.As good as the movie is, the book is better."
3,TRAVOLTA AND FREUD DO THE ARMY,"Psychiatry and Hollywood fell in love a long time ago. We all remember the famous dream conceived by Salvador Dali for Alfred Hitchcock in the mid-forties. Then we had to bear the Tennessee Williams saga with such movies as Joseph Mankiewicz's SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER or Richard Brooks's CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF. In the seventies came the psycho-killers with their bloody knives and their possessive mothers.So one could qualify THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER as a psycho-thriller. With a good plot. The best scene of the movie is the confrontation between John Travolta and James Woods. For once, the basics of Psychology have been respected by the screenwriters and the dialogs - and the actors- are terrific.Director Simon Wincer has the not so common ability to create strange atmospheres in a movie. During the first ten minutes of THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER, I was convinced that John Travolta was in mission in South Asia. Too many movies about Viet-Nam, I suppose...A DVD to rent. Typically."
4,"Travolta is good as usual, and great music!","A very intriguing plot, good acting, and a great musical sound track make this a much better than average movie. It kept me in the dark (literally and figuratively) to the end. Part of the intrigue is the fact that most of the movie seems to take place at night, and the addition of the unusual music adds to the mystique. I immediately purchased the sound track on CD. If you just want to watch a good thriller-mystery, and especially if you like John Travolta, give it a try!"
2,Good Actors Wasted...,"...in a truly distasteful setting. There was very little effort made to impart real human emotions to the various characters in this film. Try as they might, Travolta and company cannot make up for what's lacking in both the script and direction...substance. Even more insulting, the film is edited for people who have a five second or less attention span. Check out the first ten minutes of this film and see if any shot is held for that long before cutting to another. There's one excellent scene between James Woods and Travolta, but otherwise it's disappointing."
3,"ROLL UP YOUR SLEAZE, IT'S A DEEP-FRIED FREUDIAN MELODRAMA","Not even a fresh-from-Pulp-Fiction Travolta could save this lurid mess. We have known some misses from him (White Man's Burden, Mad City) but what makes General's Daughter particularly embarrassing is that it's studded with cream crowd: Madeleine Stowe, James Woods, Timothy Hutton.Of whom, only Hutton escapes unscathed. Stowe seems to be at hand merely to, well, be at hand. Woods camps it up as a secretive colonel given to Bette Davis-style gestures with his cigarettes and flagrant flirting with Travolta.Travolta, for his bit, slogs through the movie with a handful of cocky oneliners that send us the silent message -- ""Sure, this is baloney, but guess how much I'm being paid to do it"". I tried to care but couldn't.Three-star material for the recreation of the shocking dualism in the victim's character, but all of it falls flat at the incredible climax in a rainstorm as the murderer is unravelled. Most disappointing."
4,Good movie,"Another John Travolta good movie! I have seen so many of his films and this is one of his better ones. A story of a woman getting raped and dying of course. A very surprising ending and even though it the plot didn't make much sense, the acting was great. I have to give it two thumbs up! It's John Travolta, why else!"
2,The Book Was Better!,"I made the mistake of seeing this movie after I read the book (Author is Nelson DeMille, by the way). I loved the book. Didn't like the movie so much. In the book, the dialog was much better, and there was better chemistry between Paul and Sarah/Cynthia. The book also left a few clues as to who the killer is, and in the movie, they seem to grab their conclusions out of thin air. My advice is save yourself a few bucks, and since you're on Amazon anyway, buy the book."
2,"Ho-hum, implausible","I haven't read the book, but I think the movie has a rather weak story. As the murder mystery unfolds, the plot seemed more of contrivance and lurid sensationalism than an actually clever answer. Also, the movie is clumsily (to the point of being irritatingly obvious) put together, putting in cliches and stock devices to substitute for real ingenuity.Travolta's charisma keeps you watching. But, I got the constant feeling that he's trying damn hard to carry this film by himself. Everybody else doesn't seem to have much else to work with or do in this movie.It has its moments, particularly the first confrontation between Woods/Travolta which is quite tasty. It won't bore you, and you'll probably want to watch it through. But, aftewards, you'll be like, ehhh. . . ."
2,RUN-OF-THE-MILL THRILLER OFFERS FEW SURPRISES,"It's ""A Few Good Men"" meets ""8MM"" in ""The General's Daughter,"" the latest John Travolta vehicle that offers up more cliches than any one person should have to digest. Clumsily done, the film offers some solid performances, but the lagging pace and flat dialogue are its ultimate undoing. Film doesn't go anywhere soon, and a ridiculous ending doesn't help any. Film should have been titled ""A Few Good S&M Men."" Not bad, but very far from original; it's all been done before."
3,I've seen better,"It's suspensful enough, but really didn't grasp my attention. Travolta was good, as usual, except for his southern accent. I also found the story hard to follow until I went back and watched it the second time. I was say judge for yourself, but it's not one of my favorites."
1,One of the worst movies ever,If I could give this movie a negative star I would. The dialogue was absolutely cheesy; it was a murder investigation movie I don't know why they tried to make a connection with women in the military. There's nothing wrong with a movie having a message regarding women in the military but it was poorly executed and obviously forced.
1,"Save your money, buy the book!","The engrossing Nelson DeMille novel was turned into a boring, hard to follow, predictable movie. The book draws you into Ann Cambell's world, the movie never does. It is a complicated story with many twists and turns and there is no way a 2 hour movie could do it justice."
2,Stupid movie,"This movie, was an attempt at some type of conspiracy flick. It had too much gratuitous nudity and violent sex scenes. I was very disappointed. The entire plot and characters were implausible and the staging flawed. There was a hint of likelyhood that some of these thing could happen, but not everything. Thumbs down in my book. I'll watch an X files rerun any day over this."
1,go and watch the Deer Hunter,"If you want to see a no-frills film, go and watch The Deer HunterTravolta v De Niro ? Sorry John."
1,I have buyer's remorse.,"I kept wondering when the story in this movie would start. It never did. A series of events just sort of happened. Travolta's character, Paul Brenner, ""develops"" through some macho noise. A woman turns up dead. Brenner investigates. Possible suspects behave strangely, implicitly promising that some stunning revelation will be made. When that moment arrives, the conspiracy revealed proves to be unbelievable for lack of any credible motivation. Lack of motivation, in fact, is the common flaw for all of the characters in this waste of time. Pointless moments spent explaining Brenner's past relationship with a co-investigator only temporarily distract from the weak plot. Brenner was also unrealistically flip and insolent for a military man in a military setting. On the positive side, the lighting was good and the uniforms the characters wore were clean."
3,A white Danzelle Washington.,Beautifully photographed and well acted. The plot is very shallow. While watching I almost wished I was watching a Civil Action. Weak through line but stands on it's technical merits.
3,A disappointment in the end,"This movie started off very strong, and lost it somewhere in the middle. The directing, dialogue, soundtrack, and acting were all very good, but the story lost steam as the movie went on. It ended up a prectictable, ordinary movie."
1,"Travolta's Worst Movie, Hands Down!","This is one you do not want to add to your Travolta movie library! I kid you not!I saw this while on a girl's night out with my Mom when it first came out, and we both left the theatre deeply disappointed with this smutfest! The only redeeming scene was the in the beginning, with the shootout on the houseboat...Do you really need to show the full details of a rape scene? That was the primary reason why I hated this movie...to choose something so traumatic for shock value! For shame!Again, if you thought ""Staying Alive"" and the ""Looks Who's Talking"" movies were no credit to John's career, don't bother with this film!"
4,Excellent Movie....Keeps you guessing!,"The General's Daughter is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. It is a look into how the military thinks.....just keep it in the family....we can take care of our own. The soundtrack is amazing, and the suspense is chilling. The ending was surprising, and not at all predictable. Highly Recommended!"
3,Good Movie... Ending seems like it was created on the fly,"This was a very good movie with those interesting twists that keep you watching. However, at the end of the movie it appeared, in their quest for a real twist, they just made something up then had ""flashbacks"" of scenes to support the made up ending. Of course, the flashbacks were scenes you did not initially see. Therefore, it seemed like at the end they realized they did not have a plausible finish so they made it up.All in all however, I enjoyed the movie and am glad I purchased it."
2,Good start with implausable finish,"The General's Daughter had a good building tension throughout the movie until the end, which was disappointing. I did like the first 3/4 of the movie but came away wanting."
2,The General's Daughter,"The General's Daughter, promised to be the next great action thriller from John Travolta turns out to be nothing more than a sick perverted twist on films that ended like it, such as L.A. Confidential. Anything and everything is shown in this film, from sadmasicism, to rape, to a woman (The General's Daughter) sprawled out for all too see on the ground. The story plays out fairly well the first half, The General (played by James Cromwell) has ignored his daughters rape for years, so that he can move ahead in the military. John Travolta comes in to investigate something, does anyone know? Well besides the obvious, with the exceptions of a few good performances by, James Woods and Travolta, this was a very poor movie, and sick in my opinion. I left the theatre with a very bad taste in my mouth. My advise, by Phenomenon!"
3,Not so general,"Generally you would not see gang rapes being shown in movies, but i think that sometimes to pull a viewer in you almost have to push their buttons by showing things they would not see (Saving Private Ryan) But also not cross the line into vulgar material. This movie came as close as I would care to see. Would I put ths in my collection By ""No"" means would I."
2,Another disappointing basketball game for PS2,"Like NBA Live 2001, this is another basketball game that disappoints. The good points about the game is the graphics (not great though), being able to ""improve"" your players by earning attribute points, and multi-tap capability. But the game comes up short when you actually play it. The game itself is pretty slow and really slows down when a player is ""on fire"". The controls aren't great either. But what's more annoying is that there doesn't seem to be much difference in player abilities. All stars like Kobe or Vince Carter almost plays in same level as bench players. This is really noticeable when you have the lead. I guess it's to keep the scores close.This is a good party/rental game especially with several friends. While this is a sim game, it still doesn't have the playability that of Madden 2001 or SSX."
4,NBA Hoopz,"This is by far the best basketball game out for the Playstation 2. This game is dedicated to three on three basketball. There are mini games like 3-point shoot out and around the world. You can edit a team, create a team, edit a player, and create a player. The graphics are not the best on the Playstation 2, but the game is fun, and the dunks are fantastic!"
4,Useful genealogical source,This is a very useful source of genealogical information. It gives a genealogical history for the families of most of the officers involved in the Irish army of King James the Second.
5,Great comedian and wonderful documentary!,"Jim Breuer's Heavy Metal DVD is hilarious! His stand up is amazing and the documentary is SUPERB! I love to watch comedy and there are so many awesome comedians out there but Breuer is hilarious in this DVD plus the documentary is the icing on the cake. It has footage of him on the road doing his stand up thing and having fun with fans! If anything, I would watch it for the documentary ONLY because you see inside ""Jim Breuer's World"" on the road and it's quite humorous. But what's up with the peanut butter infatuation? I like peanut butter but to go to extremes? Watch the DVD and let me know...."
5,AWESOME!,"If you love to laugh your A** off and music as well this is a must have for anyone! Within 5 minutes of watching this dvd I was rolling on the floor and gasping for air to breathe between jokes. Jim's gestures and real life comediac scenerios that I lived through as a teen in the 80's made it that more funny. This guy ROCKS!Although known for doing his ""Goatboy"" skits on SNL, which were very funny, this is by far his least best talent on this video.If you enjoy great stand-up this is the best money spent for a laugh.The only thing funnier than this DVD would be to see him live which I plan to if he comes to town.And last but not least, If you enjoy heavy metal the band rocks too."
4,pretty good,Lets clear the air was better but this one is descent for 8 or 9 bucks I'll watch it again butt highly recommend Jim jeffries
5,"Great Special, Another one on the Way!","This is one of the best stand up specials on dvd. Jim Breuer brings so much energy that you can feel it through the TV. Now, several years later, Jim Breuer is returning to the stage for another stand up special that already has people talking about the unbelievable surprise ending. Go to [...] to sign up for a free give away of this dvd and find out when the new one, ""Let's Clear the Air"" is available on Amazon.com"
1,Sad for a Breuer fan,"This is a colossal disappointment for a fan of the Jim Breuer I have seen on television specials--this live show was shot when he was more than half baked, sweating, twitching, inarticulate, crass, disgusting, thoughtless and just not funny. Amazing to see the same material that I have enjoyed previously performed so clumsily. Humor really is all about timing and delivery. Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband [we collect comedy DVDs and CDs] and we watched it painfully hoping he would stop screaming and twitching and sweating long enough to deliver, finally gave up about 20 minutes in, feeling like I had been ripped off. Sad."
5,Recommend,"Have used the FS516 for the past two years in small business network consisting of Dell server, HP/Compaq work stations, HP, Samsung and Brother printers, and Sonicwall firewall without any problems. Previously had the FS108 but eventually required more than eight ports. FS516 has been replaced by the JFS516."
3,It works,"Very Noisy Fan. The unit works fine, but the the fan sounds like its about ready to take off. I had to open the unit and disconnect the fans just so I wouldn't go insane. The unit is being used seldom so there should be no problems with over heating. Just couldn't take the fan any more. Besides that, no problems."
1,Missing songs,I have this CD which is an OK rendition of some of Joplins more well know songs but the big problem with this CD is that it lists 16 songs on it and only has 9 that play. There is only room in the case for one CD so I don't know what happened to the rest of the music but I doubt that I will buy anymore Madacy music
5,HELPED ME LEARN TO TAKE TO THE SKY!,"I ordered this from Amazon, and had them ship it overnight. I was desperate. I listened to the CD for a good week or two faithfully every morning. Mr. Harrold takes you through the whole flight with a reassuring voice. Step by step through arriving at the airport, take-off, during flight and landing. I am not sure if it is the subliminal messages or the soothing talking, but it has made me alot calmer with flying. I also listen to the CD before and during the flight (except take-off and landing...you have to turn off everything electronic) but by then, I am calm enough to handle it. I still have my Klonopin handy when I fly, but this CD has allowed me to fly without having to actually take it. Thank-you Mr. Harrold. I also recommend his other true potential CD, it is a real pick-me-up."
3,get what u pay for,"When I saw this in the store I couldn't resist. Trust me, this game is not as cool as it looks on the back of the cd case but for the price, like i said I couldn't resist. I was as anxious as a nun in a cucumber patch to see if the graphics were really as good as they looked on the case. Yes and no. The graphics would be great if it wasn't for this crappy frame rate. At first I thought I would hate this game but then 2 thing factored in. 1. It's actually kinda fun even though the trick system is not controlled by the player but the computer. and 2. u get what u paid for. BTW, I really think the music is great in this game. If your into fast action arcade games like blitz, tony hawk, CTR, and coolboaders 3, u might wanna pick this game up just for the price alone..."
2,"Its Wakeboarding, but i dont know if it was worth it","Alright, to break it down, i am an avid wakeboarder, compete, i live it, breath it, all that stuff. when i heard about a wakeboading video game, i was stoked. i ordered it right away. then, this came in the mail, i popped it in, and in about 10 minutes, took it out. it is cool how realistic the tricks are, but there is no point to the game, it takes about 10 minutes to beat it. if i was on the team that created this game, i would nix the idea of making a Burstrick W-Boarding 2, because that would just be digging a deeper hole. If i could do it again, i would have waited for big air to come out for pc, but, oh well, dont buy this game"
1,HOW THIS GAME IS LIKE,The thing that made me buy this game is the price you pay for it.My freinds thought it was awsome I beat it in like 5 miniutes.My point is dont buy this game its not at all like tony hawks pro skater 1or2.The computer tells you what to do and it dishes out the moves for you its like that sorry sky diving game.Lke I said dont buy this game.
3,Burstrick Review,"I had to try this one... I mean how can you pass up ANY Playstation game..., let alone one that is based on our favorite sport. Let me start off by saying that there is a reason that this game is ... there just isn't that much to it. After sitting down for 1/2 hour at lunch I had already completed the whole game. I am not telling you not to buy this one... in fact, I'm saying buy it. It is worth the $. The tricks are sick and they are even pretty realistic. The game really reminds me of the early Coolboarders games. How could they make it better? Burstrick definitely needs a better soundtrack, give us pro rider selection, real boards to choose from, and maybe let you tour to certain hotspots like Shasta, Canyon Lake, Lake Powell, & OWC. I'm hoping for a few of these options from Shaun Murray's ActiVision game due out this summer. Oh yeah...could you tell that the rider on the cover is aVR version of Gregg Necrasson ridin' his Trip? Man, I'm a geek... I need to get on the lake!"
1,"if you buy this, you don't deserve to own a dog","this is a disgusting piece of training device. i saw one woman who had a 4-month old pitbull mix and she was wearing this collar. everytime the woman pull her, she yelps in pain. no dog should wear this. if it is for training, there are other, more humane ways to train your dog. and if you are considering of buying this collar for training then you should change you mind about having a dog."
5,refer as bible,"This book provides us a lot of knowledge about stability analysis for researchers in fluid dynamics. Especially, I would have wanted to know the basic of linear transient growth and corresponding adjoint problems, which are extended to non-linear case recently by some top-level researchers. This book could be referenced as a bible for those who study the stability of shear flows."
3,Where is the Baker Voice We Love?,"Having read all of her books, especially her early work, I was disappointed with this offering. There was nothing wrong with the writing, which is always crisp and to the point. But for me the story line was ho hum. I didn't care for the heroine at all, she seemed too bland. And the story seemed too morose to me, not too uplifting as it moved to the final pages. Certainly her past books are not happy go lucky stories, but they are at least rich in Irish detail, and this one seems to have far too many lifeless characters, except the children. Will I stop buying her books? NEVER. Although I appplaud authors who step outside of their traditional story lines, I would love to see a return to her paranormals, they are a classics and the very best in Irish Romances. I don't say don't buy it,but be aware this is a different voice for Jeanette Baker, not one I liked very much."
5,PERFECT,I love it and introduce my friends. They love it too. I will buy it again and introduce to other people.
1,Disappointing,"It's very hard to find sets of Indian figures that don't include cowboys. The picture on the box of this set looks like it will be an educational toy. When ordering I couldn't find a size or scale for the set but I depended on the picture and the ""American History Series"" title. What a disappointment. There are dozens of figures and other items, some no bigger than my thumbnail. Everything has to be snapped off of a plastic grid. How any child can play with these tiny orange plastic figures is more than I can figure. The tiniest breeze will knock most of them over. These figures can be painted, but what child could paint details on such small things. Was very sorry I bought it."
1,Never worked for me...,"Game Boy Advance SP Power Pack / B0001XP25OI never once could get this car charger to work for me, so I'm thinking either it was a dud or something got damaged in the shipping process. The retractable cord is fairly thin and delicate, so it's possible that something bent or broke in handling at some point? I've tried the charger in several cars and with more than one computer, so I'm fairly certain it's not a bad connection on my end of things. I might try to buy another one, but I wish the price was a bit lower.~ Ana Mardoll"
4,Awesome guys!,"I was in NYC August 11th, 2003.. you know, walking on the streets, looking like a tourist ;) When these guys, Itakks and his friend came to me and asked if me and my friends wanted to buy their album. I didn't know them then, but they had some skills: the other guy did the beat and Itakks rapped. We chatted with them for quite a while, and of course(!) bought a album. It is really good and I'm suprised they aren't more popular in US already?! Also, props for the attitude - that is how the real rappers start, from the streets!"
3,"a good start, only time will tell","This is a great addition to hip hop movement which is trying to rid the industry of commercial hip hop, which have no message and seems repetitive.(bling, whips, and things) Don't get me wrong there are a lot of club bangers out there. This album should be taken into consideration as an example for changed needed within hip hop. Good job TRENDS and ITAKKS. I look forward to more from ya'll. Let's see some callabos, Trends and Mos DEf...and others who participate in the hip hop struggle. Keep doing your thing ITAKKS. Lookin forward to some more hot beats, and more possible club bangers...cause that's really where people will hear the music."
3,I love Alanis but..,"..not watching Alanis beeing a tourist and beeing tought about the Indian culture.And the performances are good, but not overwhelming! And some parts of Heart Of The House sound really strange, some lyrics are missing.."
4,A FLOWER ON DRY SOIL,"I rated this set highly only because it came out when very little was being issued in the USA (legal problems). This 3 disc set contains 12 songs per disc (it could have been reduced to a 2 disc collection max), and it covers no new ground. Still, it is a budget item and for the Connie Francis collector, it should be included. The sound quality varies and is disappointing at times; however, this is still a nice collection released at a time when the only items a collector could find was on an import basis."
5,"""SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP! ""","this tape was so frikin funny,i was on the floor laughing my head off! please see this,it is just as funny as volume 1 & 6 which i also found hilarious.since Mrs. Crabtree is my favorite teacher on south park,this one is almost my favorite episode because she was like the main character in the first episode called flashbacks"
3,A large but overall mediocre and disappointing guide.,"I'm a huge fan of the Videohound books as well as movie soundtracks so when I read about this book I was pretty excited. But alas, I found this book to be the least satisfying of all their books. MANY notable and popular soundtracks are not reviewed. And I found the music compiliation section uninteresting. They could have easily filled that space with more movie soundtracks! The ""free"" cd is ok but unfortunately I had every soundtrack featured, but nonetheless, it was fun to listen to all the songs together. Buyer beware: This can be unsatisfactory if you're used to VH's usual high quality."
4,"Herbert, Fluke","Fluke was quite a surprise to me. I would have never expected the author of The Fog and the Rats trilogy to write something like this. It isn't horror at all. Instead, it is a beautiful story about the adventures of a dog told in first-person by that dog who was once a man. Through out the novel, Fluke remembers bits and pieces of his former life as a human and this is what drives the story in a vague direction. For the most part, however, this novel doesn't have a specific purpose other than to follow Fluke's many interesting experiences. Herbert's writing is brilliant in this novel and his descriptions of life as a dog are so detailed and convincing that you would think he has been one himself at some point.This novel is emotional and fast-paced all the way through. I have read books a bit similar to it (White Fang, Marley and Me, and the Redwall series to name a few) but this one is still unique. To me, reading yet another book about a dog seeming new and unique is a miracle."
1,I wish I had the option to give ZERO stars,"What a disappointment...Seeing such positive reviews from other buyers made me actually think that this album might actually be halfway decent. I sure was wrong. What a waste of time, money, and plastic. The artist is attempting to use Fleetwood Mac's name in order to gain fame. It looks as if that's his only chance, though, since there is obviously NO talent here whatsoever.My advice: avoid at all costs!"
2,it's unfortunate,"I thought about purchasing this album, because it would have looked great sitting next to my Daniel Johnston CDs, as well as my Shaggs collection, Kids of Widney High, etc. These artists are worth listening to not just because their ability to make music despite their physical/emotional setbacks is admirable, but also because their music can be extremely interesting and thought-provoking. Twilights Moon's setback seems to one rooted in over-eagerness and the need for attention and praise. It's a shame, because the music isn't varied or interesting enough to warrant the self-hype. Comparing himself to Lindsay Buckingham is such a vast miscalculation that you do kind of start to feel sorry for him...but because of the size of his ego, not because of the music he makes. (a la Johnston, et al)"
3,"Well, I'm on the fence...","I love Drops of Jupiter. The whole world loves that song. It is one of the best songs I have heard in a long time. You just can't help but blast the radio and sing along when it comes on. The rest of the album.......weeelllll? I can't quite say I reccommend it. There is an insert in the cd that offers a full refund from the record company if you do not like the cd. Did I return it...No. But I may have if I had a little extra time to do something a little more petty. It is not a bad album, but when you have a song as good as DOJ, it is hard to like the entire album when all of the other songs are just half as good and the melodies are less than great. If I had to reccommend an album by them, I would reccommend their previous effort. It was more raw and much more beautiful in its entirety."
3,Train,I really like a couple of the songs on this CD however I have heard some of their others that I like better
4,Great CD,"I originally purchased this CD for my mother's birthday but then I got hooked on it. ""Drops of Jupiter"" is a good song but then I discovered other songs on this CD. You'll get to like it more as you listen to it. I HIGHLY suggest buying this Train CD."
1,One of the dumbest albums ever,"How anyone likes this is beyond me it totally sucks. The lyrics just suck and are very uninspired, bands like this usually don't write their own music anyhow so it wouldn't suprize me. The overplayed craptastic song from this album ""Drops Of Jupiter"" is a terrible radio play song that I would rather stab myself in the throat than listen to again. The vocals are terrible and the musicianship just isn't there. Train suck."
2,Too Boring For Words,"I thought this band might have something after hearing ""Drops of Jupiter,"" so I tried the CD. Well, a single with the lyrics ""love for deep fried chicken"" should have tipped me off as to what I was getting into. This is the most abstract bunch of [junk] compiled into one place I've ever experienced. After listening to ""Drops of Jupiter"" the 300 millionth time last fall, it struck me. I'd never considered it until I listened to the album, but suddenly I realized it- I hate this band! You remember that last album, surely? If you haven't heard it. I'll tell you about it: EVEN WORSE THAN THIS ONE! (And you didn't think that was possible.) Try some Alanis Morissette or Nickelback while these guys decide if they're rockers or country crooners."
4,"Good, but not great","Most of the songs on this album are pretty good. I like ""She's on Fire"" and ""Let it Roll"" a lot. However, none of them are as remarkable as the breathtaking title song ""Drops of Jupiter"", which was the whole reason I asked for this CD for Christmas. ""Drops of Jupiter"" is beautiful and poetic, with a lot of references to celestial bodies. The rest of the songs took me a while to get into. At first I thought they all sounded pretty much the same, but after the first couple of times I listened to the CD, the differences between the individual songs grew more and more distinct, and the CD began to grow on me. This CD hasn't exactly made Train my favorite band, but I may very well buy the other CD."
2,Only a few good songs,"This CD was recommended to my by friends and I had also heard the song Drops of Jupeter, however when I got the CD, I found that Drops of Jupeter was the only really good song. I am known for my wide range of music I listen to but I was very disapointed, I would borrow it or preview it before buying."
3,alas for expectations,"I spent a long time trying to find this cd in seoul. Eventually found it and was very excited, as I was in love with the title track. Unfortunately the rest of the cd cannot be described as anything but insipid. There are nice moments, and I could grow to like Mississippi, but overall it just doesn't work. Apart from track 3 (drops of jupiter) the other songs don't live up to my expectations. I don't regret buying it cos I still like Drops of Jupiter, but it won't beat Nine Days The Madding Crowd and Barenaked Ladies Maroon as the top plays in my cd player."
2,"The ""16th Avenue"" Effect","Back twenty or more years ago Lacy J. Dalton sang 16th Avenue, a superb country song about unknowns seeking their musical fortune in Nashville. One verse had this lyric:Ah, but then one night in some empty roomWhere no curtains ever hungLike a miracle some golden wordsRolled off of someone's tongueWell, that's Train. They had the miracle of Drops of Jupiter and who knows where it came from, but come it did, like a slap to the face and always remained fabulous with every overplayed-on-the-radio hearing. (Though I could do without all the ""na-na-na-na-na"" background over the last minute or so.)And beyond that, there is not a single thing on this CD worth hearing, relentless mediocrity, as if one were trapped on the state fair circuit, hearing big-haired bands from the 80's eternally playing their semi-hits while roller coaster and dodge 'em cars add to the aural clutter.Two stars for one miracle of brilliance."
4,Decent but avarage effort,"This Train album has the grammy winning catchy 'She's on fire' and 10 more rock songs. I am basically incline to 60's and 70's. I laid my hand on this CD to try some of the new music. They did not do anything significant, but it is not bad for casual listening. 'Mississippi' is another song that is worth a mention.Listen it while packing your bags or chatting with your friends. This will serve as a good background for those activities. Not the sort of album we would listen to 20 years later."
4,good album overall,"Simple, yet strong lycirs. Uncluttered well orchestrated music. Easy to listen to the first time around, and easy to keep listening to. What more do you want?!"
4,Not totally a disappointment.,"Drops of Jupiter is by far the best song on the album. Some other songs are good, but none measure up to it. Some of the songs are just sleepy and not in a good way. It is worth the 13 dollars however as long as you have a program button or are ready to skip over the bad songs. Also the fact that the only lyrics they have written on the cd is to Drops of Jupiter is a source of annoyance."
3,Continuing along the same path only not quite as fresh,"Continuing along the same path only not quite as freshOn DROPS OF JUPITER, Train continues to put forth the sound that brought about their successful debut. But this time out there is a sense of sameness about the material. There are some nice numbers here, particularly, the spare ""It's About You,"" but some of the numbers like ""Mississippi,"" and ""Let It Roll, ""seem to take forever to develop. A bit of a sophomore slump creatively, but still a solid set."
2,skip it.,"i bought this cd because i had heard train's single, ""drops of jupiter,"" on the radio. the lyrics were whimsical [i can't resist any song that mentions soy lattes =o) ] and i thought that the violins in the background were a welcome change from the average single-riff guitar-playing that's all too common in pop these days. unfortunately, however, the band seems to have structured their entire cd on that one single. no other song stands out in any way. i imagine the band has recognized the fact that all the rest of their songs are simply filler material, which would account for the fact that they didn't include the lyrics to any song except ""drops of jupiter"" in the liner notes.my advice: don't buy this album on the strength of one song alone - it gets old fast! download the song if you want it that badly, and make sure that you like the rest of the songs on the disc, too, before investing in a copy."
1,ok just for fun....,"lets take the counting crowes, the wallflowers, and hey why not the black crowes..take everything even remotely interesting from all those bands (which werent all that interesting to begin with) and throw it away...mix it together boil it down til its bland, tasteless and easily consumed and ..voila!!!..you have the garbage that is train..enjoy milking that awful song while it lasts cuz no ones gonna care next year.. please people avoid the urge to buy this..and stop encouraging this stuff"
3,"Well, um, it's growing on me, I guess.","The only song I really think is OK is ""Drops of Jupiter"". I haven't really heard the rest of this album yet but from what I've heard, it's a pretty OK album that will eventually grow on me. Just like the song, ""Drops Of Jupiter"". I used to not like that song, but now I think it's getting better. I couldn't really find the CD-single on Amazon.com so I couldn't really review just the song. Hopefully, all the other songs on this album will be good, too. But I think I'll just wait for the ""Drops Of Jupiter"" CD-single to come out. But pretty good if you like Train."
2,Underwhelming,"OK - people seem to think that anything NOT Britney/N Sync is wonderful and a ""breath of fresh air"". By those less than ambitious standards this album is, indeed, tremendous. By the standards of good, quality music this album sucks. It is a soulless, uninspiring piece of banality that gives one the impression that it longs to be interesting but is inhibited by the lack of personality and conviction (towards anything) of the band. These guys refuse to rise above mediocrity and as a result, this album is as fun a listen as watching paint dry. Not horrible, just boring as all hell..."
2,Let's all go to Starbucks,"This is just another Alterna -pop Radio-friendly rock bands that is virtually indistinguishable from all the other junk.This music is just a boy band with guitars for people in there 30's,another example why the industries album sales are going down and people are fleeing the radio"
2,Did you make it to the Milky Way?,"Does anybody else think these lyrics are painfully bad? We live in the frickin Milky Way ok? It is so stupid to say ""Did you make it to the Milky Way."" Maybe they should just stick with singing ""eh eh eh"" and ""na na na na na"" instead of putting in any lyrics. At least then I wouldn't have to cringe when I listen to the radio."
1,...,I listened to this stuff and it's so shallow! Dumb lyrics no melodies and chord changes a monkey could play. ...
5,Excellent CD!,"Sometimes there's a song that is so good you're willing to take a gamble and buy the CD on the basis of it. That was the case for me with this CD and unlike many others, that gamble paid off. Drops of Jupiter is an excellent song, but the CD is a treasure trove of really great music. I would recommend it to anyone who loves good music!"
5,Carry me to the stars...,"I'm not one who falls in love with a song right away...it takes me several listenings before I really get into it...not with ""Drops of Jupiter.""...I clicked onto MTV one day, and Train's video for this song came on....instantly hooked...mesmorized....I asked for the CD for Christmas, and cannot wait to jam that song in my car, moon-roof open, driving past the sea............my new theme song......."
5,Drops of Jupiter is a masterpiece,"I am totally overwhelmed at the genius displayed in the title track of this album. It brought my interest in the current music scene back to life. It is so strongly written, so self-assured, poetic, and whimsical and multi-layered. This song is sure to become a classic.It will certainly always be a favorite in my life. The album as a whole is truly masterful. Moving, real and complex. These guys have their stuff together. They know what they want to say, and say it beautifully. Thank you, Train. Congratulations, you did it!"
5,Awesome.,I'd just like to say this is one of the best sophomore albums I've heard put out in a long time. The album just rocks from beginning to end. The band has come a long way from the self-titled debut which is also one of the top 10 of my collection. I just can't say enough good things about it. Pick it up and listen to it yourself!
5,The Best ALBUM I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!,I own approx. 800 CD's ranging in all types of music. this is the only one i own that i love everysong off of. i cannot put it better than this is the best album i have ever heard from one of the best bands out there today plus my favorite.
3,"It's okay, not wonderful.","I'm not going to repeat what everybody's said, but yes, most of the songs on this CD don't have as much feeling as ""Drops of Jupiter"". If it were MY choice, i'd ask that they make a Single CD on that song. It's very...soothing. It makes you sort of reminisce what's happened to you, what's happening, and what's to come. The rest of the songs are alright, but they're just not the sort of songs i can sink my teeth into and enjoy every bite my ears take."
4,Drops of Jupitar,"Well what to say about trains new cd ""Drops of Jupitar"" except that it is well awesome. ""Drops of jupitar"" is a great song and ""whippng boy"" really made me think about my friend. Trains lead singer just is awesome and i think that this is a very good follow up album. If you were to but only 1 cd this summer, this should be the one."
3,"good, but not great","I bought this CD after hearing the band speak of their influences, and a few of my favorite bands were mentioned. So I gave Train a chance.The title track/first single turns out to one of the only great songs on the album. Don't get me wrong the whole CD is very listenable, but it doesn't break any new ground... Reminds me a lot of the WallFlowers ""Bringing Down The Horse""."
5,no less than 5 stars,"This is one of the best CD's this year. If there were more than five stars, then I would give Train it. At first when I got it, I sort of had to get used to Pat's voice a little since it sounds different than I expected, but that's all. This CD is one of the those very RARE times where you can listen to the whole thing, not skip songs until you get to the one single that you bought it for. I'm definitely going to their concert this fall. If you have to buy one CD this summer, buy Drops of Jupiter."
5,I Don't Just Hand Out 5 Stars,"Without gushing or writing some long and sappy star-struck review, I have to say right off the bat that this is one of the best albums that I have heard in a long time. It's funny, because I picked up Drops on the same day I got the new R.E.M. (Reveal), and I bought it almost as an afterthought since reading the glowing reviews of the R.E.M. CD. Well, I can't stop listening to Drops of Jupiter whereas I am struggling to get a feel for Reveal.I'm not even a big fan of Train's debut album, which I'd rank in the 3 1/2 area. The lyrics on Drops are super (""Can you imagine a love like deep fried chicken, your best friend always stickin' up for you, even when I know you are wrong""), the arrangements are great and there is only one weak track on the entire CD. As much as I like Counting Crows, I think that this is the CD that they aspire to make."
2,Drops Of Brilliance And Loads Of Mediocrity,"Like many reviewers, I can truly appreciate the title track, Drops of Jupiter. Great vocals, super keyboards and heart felt lyrics make this song(not CD) a true winner.The rest of the CD just sounds like run of the mill pop that is here today gone tommorow. She's On Fire, Its About You, Missisippi, and Let It Roll On are semi-memorable tunes with a few good harmonies thrown in for good measure.Otherwise this group sounds like they are merely trying to find their sound. It's too clean and pretty to be rock n roll but not natural enough to be country. Its merely syrupy hum drum pop that does not offend me but certainly does not move me either."
2,Formulaic Rock,Heard the albums and saw them live. The band is okay but unimaginative. If you like straight forward rock with predictable hooks than you might like this album. The band is fine but one can do much better. Very radio freindly if that is what you are looking for.
4,Drops of Jupiter: Title track is a classic!,"I'm new to Train, only having heard the title track during a commercial for the film, K-Pax. I immediately went in search of the song, and was fortunate to discover Train. If you're a fan of Third Eye Blind, Matchbox 20, and the Dave Matthews Band, you'll love this CD. I've also noticed that on Amazon's list of people who bought this CD have also purchased novels by Anita Shreve and Amy Tan. That's no accident, people! Train's music, especially the title track is very literate, romantic, and most importantly, adult. Instead of the lead singer proclaiming that he's anyone's ""slave"", he sings of seeing his lover enjoying both Mozart and tae-bo and realizing that there's always ""room to grow.""While this CD is contemporary, it has certain elements of the old 70's anthem-type songs. Born To Run, Into the Mystic, and Maggie May, come to mind. Not to say that Train is close to that level of artistry yet, but I'll be interested to see what they do next."
4,Exellent!,"This CD was a definate winner- the reason it doesn't get all five stars is only because I only like 4 songs on the CD. (Hopefully I will find more with time) I would describe Train as U2 with a southern accent. I LOVE Drops of Jupiter. It's About You is my second fave, Hopeless is also wonderful, and if you are in a mellow mood, Mississippi is perfect. I would recomend this CD to anyone, unless you don't like county music."
4,"Whimsical Lyrics, Mellow Sounds on ""Drops of Jupiter""","Although the best song on this album is definitely the title track, Train's second cd is definitely worth a listen...and a second...and a third. Other strong songs include ""She's on Fire,"" ""Respect"", and ""Let It Roll."" What makes Train unusual are the dreamy and not quite logical lyrics. Example: ""the best soy latte that you ever had is me""?! Drops of Jupiter is full of beautiful, mellow, and sometimes melancholy sounds and images. A satisfying and whimsical listening experience."
3,Drops of Jupiter GREAT........suddenly........dissapointment,"I love the song Drops of Jupiter, even my parents do. But if you are expecting Train's ""sound"" to be like that, you will be dissapointed with this CD. There were no violins, no beautiful lyrics, no uplifting vocals in the other songs, just unoriginal stuff that is somewhat good, but I feel like I've heard it all before. It's like when on records Side A was the hit, and Side B was the song meant for Side B. No great things coming from the rest of the CD, so you may want to look into purchasing the single."
4,"If you're in your car, you better have this CD handy.","Yes, Train sounds a lot like some other bands that are out there, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It seems to me that everyone needs to have a disc they can blast in the car on a summery day and just enjoy and sing along to. This could be that disc for you and yours. The lyrics, while on the surface a little pedestrian, develop layers of meaning as you get into the disc; 'Hopeless' has to be one of the most pained and nuanced tracks about infidelity I've heard. The careful modulation from bravado to self-delusion to vulnerability is honestly touching. It's the one really stand-out track on the disc, but if you're like me and you don't really pay attention to most of what the media deems ""alternative"" music, you may enjoy this slice of sunshine for the occasional delights it brings."
2,Nossir,"Mediocrity,thy name is Train.This is one of those listen-to-it-once-and-throw-it-in-the-clost-for-a-year-albums when rediscovered,makes you remember the [money] you wasted on it.Don't bother with this version of Hootie and the Blowfish 2001.Just say NO!"
2,"Why, Train?","I was looking forward to this album for a long time. I liked the upbeat sound of Train's debut release. I was looking forward to seeing what they would put together on their new release ""Drops of Jupiter"". The first release, the title-track was exceptional. It made me look forward to the release of the album even more.With that said, I was greatly disappointed by the lack of enthusiasm on this album. It's dull, lifeless, and leaves a lot more to be desired. I wish I could say differently, but this album has disappointed me big-time."
2,Now we know.,"Before the release of ""Drops of Jupiter,"" musical pundits were at odds over how many times the phrase ""yay hey hey"" could be uttered in one song. Now the question has been answered. It is 3,229."
3,disappointing,"i love the drops of jupiter song, but maybe too much, the rest of the cd was ok, but wasnt as good. not in my rotation of cds..."
2,Frat-boy rock,"Taken in a vacuum, this CD is okay. The writing, harmony, and instrumentation are good. But I have several problems with it.First, I heard it the first time when they were called Vertical Horizon, or the Origin, or School of Fish, or Material Issue, or or or.... get the point? Sounds like a bunch of theatre / music major frat brothers got to thinking at a party and said ""You know Pat, there's not enough good middle-of-the-road music these days; we should start a band.""The second problem I have with this CD is the production quality. It sounds as if they placed the mics too close to everything, then dampened the higher frequencies. Very thumpy, claustrophobic, and annoying if you tend to listen for production quality.So if you like any of the aforementioned bands, this CD is a good bet. As for me, based on the reviews, I thought this was a breakthrough album. It is NOT a breakthrough album, and I'm fairly disappointed."
1,just 24 minutes of video,"The video is nice and entertaining for children.But it lasts only 24 minutes. The indications on the box on the running time are misleading.I believe that for its price, 24 minutes of video are poor and disappointing. Other DVD for the same age range and price run for more than twice it (Thomas and friends, Barney, Dora, Elmo).I would recommend parents to choose another DVD and to carefully look at the duration of the movie, since children might get bored soon of repeated programmes."
2,Noisy and Slow,"I was really excited to receive my 24 port switch. I was excited until I installed it, ( it was is very noisy). Then when I used it I never get transfers to switch up to the 100, they stay on the 10. Since this was/is a used item I suspect that the original owner knew it didn't have the 10/100 switching capability any longer. My loss, I guess. The old adage,""You get what you pay for,"" seems to owner be the over riding lesson here."
1,Die Bish Die...,"To the whole cast and crew. Basically anyone that had anything to do with this hot steam rolled mess posing as a film. The whole production was a GHASTLY mess from beginning to end. Atrocious acting, run of the mill plot, bad lighting, dialog, makeup, casting and costume design. I knew there was going to be some gore but the rape scenes were down right unnecessary. I should have followed my gut. With a name like ""Run Bitch Run"" what did I expect. Jokes on me for wasting an hour or so out of my life watching this steaming dung heap of a film. Everyone involved in this mess should go play in traffic."
2,Not as Good as Nude Nuns with Big Guns,"I bought this flick based on the fact that I liked the directors' second feature-length film, ""Nude Nuns with Big Guns."" The latter film is so over-the-top outrageous, cynical, wryly humorous, and has funny dialogue and situations. ""Bitch"" has none of these. It is a pure, deranged, off-putting exploitation film, violent, sleazy, and unpleasant to watch as the story unfolds. Basically, the movie is about a young girl's descent into madness after being raped and brutalized by a threesome of perverted nut jobs. The bulk of the film is spent with her getting revenge on the three crazies. There is abundant nudity, and the recurrent themes of anti-religion, Nun-bashing, and lesbianism are all there as in ""Nuns,"" but without any sense of humor or empathy for the main character. The downbeat ending is the poorest cap to a bad film I have ever seen."
2,"ok... for late night flickering, but not good to buy","the movie was ok... if you just flickering the television when nothing else is on. If you want to buy this movie, i recommend you go back in time to where this would be a significance."
1,Ugh.,"I usually like well done revenge movies. I happened to watch this one because it is available on Netflix and the synopsis sounded interesting. Well, this movie is now in the top three of all time worst movies I have ever seen. Actually, I fast forwarded through about 75% of it because it was just unbearable.I try not to judge what other people may or may not like. If you enjoy absolutely horrible writing and acting, totally over the top gratuitous sex and violence, and characters who don't seem related to the genus homosapien, you may enjoy this movie.(I created the ""Mikey Likes It"" name for a review I wrote about a TV. Trust me, it has nothing to do with this movie)."
2,"Rape, Revenge. Rubbish...unless you're into that sort of thing","Pure sexploitation. All T&A. Cheat thrills, Catholic school girls, and bad acting. There's a big difference between an homage and a low budget, minimally skilled production attempting to leach off a recent trend. Guess which this is? There's not much else to it really, well, except for the plunger love and necrophilia. And decapitation. And machete sodomy (machodomy?). But that's it."
3,run,Subjectifing women at its best here in this b rated 70's film that just seemed to be all over the placebut still keep a rather descent revenge angle
2,Let's play some rock'n'roll,"Yet another 2 CD live set from Little Feat - one of 4 in recent years. Some good versions of their more recent tracks but some real murder of the old Feat classics. I kept staring at the box to remind myself I was listening to Lafayette Railroad. As for the 27 minute version of Dixie Chicken, I fell asleep in Bill Payne's piano solo - when I woke up I thought I was listening to Rachmaninov. It's a great rock'n'roll song, and Payne is a fine rock'n'roll pianist, so give the song the respect it deserves. If you must buy this, stick with the first disc or learn how to program your player to skip at least the first 2 tracks of the second disc."
1,No Communication!,"It has been more than a month, and I still haven't received my book. Further, there has been no communication from the provider. I'm disgusted!"
1,DO NOT BUY for your 1/36 Micro-T Stadium Truck!!!,This battery simply isn't compatible with the Losi 1/36 Micro-T Stadium Truck! The electronics that are installed in the vehicle CLEARLY state that 4.8 up to 7.2 volts is what is acceptable. The stock battery is a 4.8V 150mAh NiHM. This battery is a 7.4V 180mAh LiPo. Easy math tells you it is 0.2V over capacity. This boils down to the speed controller overheating and shutting itself off (to protect it) after about 20 seconds of driving. I have about 25 years of electric R/C experience racing 1/10 scale cars. I'm ashamed I blindly trusted Losi and Amazon to do the homework and sell me compatible parts for me and my nephews fun little 'toy'.
4,Great video!,"Fun and energetic, the song list was good, but the audio and camera work was spotty. Great addition to a collection and fun for a few beers!"
3,I wish Ward Wrote More,"The author brags that Ward, who termed the phrase ""myofascial release"" and helped popularized it among mainstream American Osteopaths, was one of the co-authors but he only contributes two paragraphs regarding myofascial release. The book describes different techniques for different problems but the reader should be warned: Myofascial release is both clinician and patient dependent, so the book should only be a guide of what you could possibly do. Furthermore, myofascial release involves three parts: compression, traction and twist. The author just describes stretching in her techniques. Because myofascial release is so patient and clinician dependent writing a book on this particular technique is very difficult. The author has not been able to meet the challenge."
4,a practical book,"This book is useful to help you apply the manual techniques of trigger point release. However,you will have to buy other books to have a complete guide about the practice of myofascial release. This book can help you."
1,The Myofascial Release Manual,"I never got the book, I have tried to reach the dealer and nothing happens. This is NOT satisfying at all!"
4,Too Short,"This game was great graphically and it had a good plot, but it was too short, i was able to beat it in 6 hours total over 2 days. Also after you beat it you can't keep playing and revisit stuff, you just start off from your last save, so once you beat it, all that is left is versus mode, unless you saved early and kept it there. I reccomend renting this game."
4,Great Game!!!!( most of the time ),"This game is really pretty good (especially for a mech game). The graphics are nice and and smooth.The controls are of the best ever made for a mach game and pretty much anyone can master the controls the first day. The game is pretty short though which kills it some if your looking for a good, lengthy game.Also, beleive it or not as it turns out you have to beat the game which really [stinks] if you want to play any multiplayer and if you don't have a memory card its pretty much useless to beat it unless you just want to beat it.But its still a great game worth buying especially if you want to play a game thats just plain fun."
2,GARBAGE!,"This game is one of those games that starts out fun, really cool and easy to manipulate with only a few tiny flaws that mar the surface and quickly starts on a downward spiral of sheer annoyance. I can't say any more without spoiling the game for those who still want to purchase this waste. What a shame that this game had wasted all that potential. It has great graphics, tight control and mediocre voice acting. The only way that this game sells so well is because of the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo, and I can safely say that it is the SOLE reason to buy this steaming pile, pressed into a disc."
2,Not my type of game,"I rented this game and got bored with it in minutes. However, it came with a demo of MGS2 which I think is awesome."
2,I bought this because of the 5 star rating...,"This game is awful...A MUST RENT..What a waste of money..Graphics are pretty good but not top notch..I am sorry,but for all of you who gave this 5 stars, You would not know a great game if it smacked you in your Yapper !!"
1,What a joke.,"Well, It seems that you can't trust Konami. They come out with great games like Metal Gear Solid, but also produce [junk] like this. The demo disc, well it's worth it, but you can buy the game now. The gameplay is horrible. It's just a giant robot collding into other robots in order for them to explode. WOW! And that awful awful AWFUL soundtrack.[Bad] techno with a singer who's genitals were ripped open by fishing knives. The voice acting [stunk], espicially Leo...Bad game. Don't waste your time."
2,Not all its hyped up to be,"Okay I know you've come here and read all these glowing reviews. But Zoe doesn't live up to the hype. The graphics are good but the scenery is plane. The game is repetitive, not in a goodway. There is hardly any variation in enemy's and missions and in the end you'll find it better to have rented then buy. yes Metal Gear Solid is packaged with it and is amazing. It only demonstrates what a good game is and what Zoe of enders is not. Either way I would rent it first. If you like it then buy it."
3,Its fun to beat up robots,"I have to say I am a huge fan of fighting robots. I dont care if it is anime style or comedy central zanniness. there is something sweet about fighting robots. This game does an admirable job of fitting the bill. The controls and graphics are both superb. It is fun to play. There are two problems, 1st it is repetitive and second, the story is pretty bad. I mean cheese. Not a nice cheddar either, smelly rocquefort (spelling). I think you will enjoy playing the game and it might even be a buy if you love the genre like me, otherwise you would do best to rent. Also, it comes with a demo for metal gear solid that is awesome. In fact it might be better than the main game -- I dont know what that says. You will definitely want to try this out. I have spent almost as much time with the demo as the actual game."
4,Awsome game,"Z.O.E is a awsome game. It is very intense. I suggest this for any one who likes Gudam games or challeging games. THis game would have been a 5 star, but it is short. the ending really [stinks]. for being such a awsome game I expected a much better ending."
3,Its not what you would expect,"This game has better potential. It could of done better. I think the game developers should of spent a little more time on it.UPSIDE- Stunning graphics! This game has very few contenders in the graphic category. Game comes with Metal Gear 2 DEMO!! Decent storyline.DOWNSIDE-Short game lenght. I beat it in 2.5 hours. Music gets old after a while. Horrible ending. I have to say that it probably ended so bad because they are probably developing a sequel to it in the future. The ending makes you think that something else is going to happen, but it never does.Recommendation- Yes Why? This game is a good game for Gundam Wing fans. Maybe for Mech fans. It would even recommend it to some RPG fans. Some words of caution, DON'T buy it as your first game or you'll be extremely bored. You can also buy it just for the demo, but the demo isn't worth ... bucks itself."
3,This has the WORST voice acting,the game is ok (4 stars)but the voice acting is SO bad the demo of MGS is what you should spend the 50$ on if you like MECHs this gfame is for you but beware the voice acting is bad
3,Only Because Kojima worked on it and Yoji Shinkawa,"I was not very pleased with control schemes, but I was excited because the art is very Yoji Shinkawa. I bought this game because I am a fan of kojima san and of Yoji Shinkawa. The graphics aren't the best either, did not expect this from the same people who made MGS2 and MGS3. Its sort of a combination of PS1 graphics with low PS2 graphics. But I do have to say that the story was good very kojima."
3,"Great, but short.","This game has it all. The grapics are great, the gameplay is fantastic, and it had a good storyline. I like the vs. mode, and the bosses were HARD! They were a nightmare to get through. However, the game is short. I beat it in 5 hours. And this took me 2 weeks! The final boss, you can't kill him, and you run away. THAT'S IT! This is begging for a sequel. It was good, but it should've had more time. It should've had 4 discs or something. Well, It was good, but I am impatiently waiting for a sequel!"
3,"Awsome Game, But Absolutly No Replay Value","When I first rented ZOE I was simply amazed (and not because it came with MGS2, whilch is also a cool game). The first time I rented ZOE I got to the Dam. Then I decided to buy it, but then I beat it in less then thirty minutes from my saved game and the time I played it was approx. 2h and 30min. I then played versus mode which is Extremly easy. Plus there is only one boreing ending only one and if you want to beat it again all you do is get 2 more charecters for Vr. mode and 2 new places, and the same old ending. All in all this should be only a rental except the MGS2 Demo which comes with ZOE is the best shooter arfound now."
4,aj the man 1234321`,ZONE OF THE ENDERS is a good game. but I giv it a 4stars rating. it has realy good game play. and I like the graphic. you should get this game. right NOW DO IT NOW RIGHT NOW SEE YOU.
1,this game is borinnnngggggggggggggggggggggg!,"once you end it youll never play it again , just the first part of soulreaver its ""half a game"" we as the consumer should sue them for making 50 % not 100 % percent of a game ."
1,What a waste,"Waited so long for this game to be released and when I finally got it, I ejected it after 30 minutes. Boring characters, irritating cut-scenes, horrible voice-over. The only good thing is the MGS2 demo included. But to say that's worth 50 bucks? If you want fast paced mech action than I opt for Virtual On Oratorio Tangram (Sega Dreamcast) anytime. ZOE doesn't even come close in any aspect..."
2,Journey's End - Joan Elliott Pickart,"The dollhouse collection was spectacular, antique dealer Victoria Blair admitted - worth every mile of her trip from San Francisco to Sunshine, New Mexico - but she never expected the hostile reception rancher Sage Lawson gave her. Suspicious of her sudden appearance at his grandmother's request, Sage decided this city girl was just like the ex-wife who'd abandoned him and their young son for the bright lights. But Victoria breathed a fresh vilality ito the sleepy litle town - and Sage was hopelessly seduced by her warmth and sweet energy. Victoria, who'd grown up all alone, adored ner new surroundings and blossomed in the heat of Sage's passionate caresses. Could life at the Lazy L restore the childhood dreams she'd put away forever - dreams of belonging, of being loved by a man who'd never let her go?"
5,Well worth every dollar,"I went to every electronics store in the area, and not one had a 21"" monitor on display. I had to buy one based solely on reviews on the internet. I settled on the PF815. Spending this much money without seeing the product first had me real nervous, but what a surprise! It surpassed all my expectations. The screen is as flat as they advertise. In fact, it makes my other monitor (a 17"" Dell Trinitron) look curved in comparison. The images are crisp and the colors are vibrant. The monitor takes up less desk space than I anticipted. I couldn't be happier with this purchase."
5,'34 Ford Coupe,"This is another great kit from AMT. The pieces fit well, and the scale is ""right on."" I chose to build the ""stock"" version to go along with other models I have of that era. For a 1/25th scale model, it is highly detailed, and was fun to build. Highly recommended."
1,Disappointment,"Usually love all Nora Roberts books, but this one was not as well scripted and was predictable. I will wait for ratings to pour in before I purchase the next one :)"
1,Summer Love,Really! Ms. Roberts isn't rich enough that she has to reprint and recover her old books so you will buy them AGAIN! Very disappointing.
2,Not her best,"I can't think of too many Nora Roberts books that I haven't loved. This is one. Boring and stupid. Also, I wonder when it was actually written . Storyline very outdated. Don't waste your time or money"
4,partners,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. I have just about all of her books. Most of her books I enjoy alot, some I don't. This book was good, but, not as good as some of her other books. I did enjoy reading it though."
4,Partners,"I always enjoy Nora Roberts stories as she keeps the tale going and it is always easy reading, etc. etc."
4,Partners,"As usual, Nora Roberts keeps you so engrossed in her books that it is hard to put them down. Partners is romantic, funny and just good reading! She is one of my favorite authors for a very long time. I don't know how she writes so many, so fast and makes them worthwhile and fun to read!"
4,It's NR.,"NR books are a sure thing. Even those light on plot are enjoyable to read, as well as engrossing. I have read so many ""romance"" books, that I'm a great deal harder to please than I used to be. I start quite a few books that I don't care to finish. Just not interested in the outcome. But I've never put down a NR book before the ending. This one lived up to my expectations. Also kept me guessing longer than most books do. Love NR as Roberts AND as Robb."
4,Partners,"I enjoyed this book, as I enjoy all the Nora Roberts books. I will continue to purchase her novels in the future for my Kindle."
4,Good BOOK,"Nora Roberts fan from way back. I did enjoy this book. As always, I was kept engaged with the characters and the plot was not obvious."
5,GREAT BOOK,"Parrtners was a great read. I loved this book, would recommend it to all my friends. Nora Roberts is the best!"
5,I loved it,Great book! Nora Roberts never disappoints! I am always waiting for a new book from her. I would recommend for sure!
3,not the best nora roberts.,iplenty of romance girl meets boy theme with plenty of twists and turns but felt it missed that certain zing.t
4,I greatly enjoyed this book!!!!!,Nora Roberts again tells an excellant story. The characters were well thought out and the plot was great.
3,Easy read,"This is a good story and easy to read. Not as gripping as some others by NR, but I liked it."
4,Nora Roberts Fan,"I have read some of her books and this was right up there with mystery, love, and some twisted sadness."
3,Not one of her best,An okay book but must have been written before she polished her story telling skills. Not as well written .
2,"Nora Robert, Partners",Content trite and predictable. The writing was unsophisticated and shallow. I was bored. I found several typos in the content.
3,Another good read from Nora.,Nora Roberts does not disappoint. This was another good book.Light reading and entertaining.Her weather descriptions had me feeling quite warm here in Wisconsin this January while it's 20 degrees here.
5,Partners,This book was very enjoyable. I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and this again was another great read.
2,Not great,I am an avid Nora Roberts reader I must say this book wasn't up to her usual caliber of writing.
3,Good but one of her best,Believe this one an earlier book for Nora Roberts. Had it's moments and kept interest most of time. Not one of her best.
5,One of my favorite authors,I try to read all of Nora Roberts' books. I enjoy her fanciful stories and her beautiful characters. I look forward to them
4,Enjoyed another Nora Roberts book,"Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors. At first this book seemed to be ""formula"" written. As I read along, I couldn't put it down and breezed through to the end. Not one of her best, but a good read."
3,"Older Nora Roberts, but nice","This is an older Nora Roberts book, and she has improved since she wrote this one. But it is nice, nonetheless. i do have to say, however, I'm getting a little tired of the virginal (yet smart and interesting) heroine."
2,Partners,Not up to Ms. Roberts usual standards. Shallow and predictable characters. Not an indepth or particularly compelling story line compared with many of her other books.
3,Partners,"The book had a good story. It was an older book, and when advertising I would like to see copyright dates in a prominent place."
4,.,.Nora is my favorite author and I always enjoy reading her books. This was a good short read . Thanks
5,Great author,Who doesn't love Nota Roberts? She is an excellent author of romance.Besides romance there is a mystery andA storyline. She gets your curiosity right away and you are already intrigued to solve the mystery yourself. with each book she writes she weaves a new story each time so you never get bored.
5,Partners,Nora Roberts is the best. She new fails to write the best in romance and suspense. Partners fills the bill for both.
4,Published 2001,"Just a warning for NR readers, this is not a ""new"" book. It was originally published in 2001. I did enjoy it back then and felt it was written in her normal standard. She has written so much that now she revisits and revises her plots. I still enjoy her talent, but not enough to pay $7 for a Kindle book. Penquin needs to realize that there are so many other options to previously published books that they are really shooting themselves in the pocketbook when they insist charging full price. If they can sell paperbacks at SAM's for $5, then Amazon should certainly be able to get their clients the same deal. Shame on both of you."
2,disappointed,Shown as new book but really repackaged. Dated story line about print newspaper reporters. Would not have preordered if I had known.
1,Reprint!!!,"I try to carefully check to be sure I'm not getting a reprint of an older book. Well, this one is a reprint and I'm very disappointed. It doesn't come close to being as interesting as her newer books, I didn't bother finishing it. I really hate getting a reprint of an older book, feel like I've been ""taken"". Bummer..."
2,Partners,I'm a huge fan of Nora Roberts and this book was so disappointing!! There is no way this book is a new release. It is very awkward and doesn't have her usual great plot. It doesn't even flow like a Nora Roberts novel!
2,Very Disappointed!!!!!,"Love Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb, but was disappointed this book was another reprint. Ordered on my kindle then realized I already own it in paper back."
2,old book re-published,"Not really enjoyable and its an older book. Yes I could have looked at the publication date however, it came to me in an Amazon eMail as ""New"" Nora Roberts.Not up to par with her more recent really trulyl new books."
4,enjoyed the story,"this book was very easy reading and enjoyable, I liked it very mush. Nora Roberts books are always very good that I cannot put it down."
3,Not her usual!,"This book had none of the fire, and spice Noras books usually have. I was disappointed. Normally I love anything Nora Roberts writes. But not this time."
5,Excellent!,"This book kept me turning pages as fast as I could read! Exciting storyline, and as always, very well written!"
4,Partners,What a nice way to spend an afternoon reading Partners by Nora Roberts. Little romance.& little mystery from a great author.
3,Too short,"Nora's books are consistently good, but this one seemed a bit too short, maybe the conflict was resolved too predictably."
4,Excellent reading,"Thoroughly enjoyed Partners, it was a book that kept you guessing. Look forward to reading more of Nora Roberts books."
3,My First E book,"I did enjoy reading this ebook. I have read lots of Nora Roberts books and always enjoy them. It was an easy read. One character was smoking and lighting cigarettes all the time and it seemed out of place, so I think it was written some time ago when smoking was sexy....can you believe there was such a time?"
2,Not my style at all,"Actually until I got the email from Amazon to review the book I'd forgotten I'd read it.It was a quick read, but not memorable is best I can say."
5,I need all of the Old Nickeloden Shows on DVD!!! :),I remember when I would come home from school and watch Hey Dude! salute your shorts and Clarrissa explains it all.. and SNICK!! all of those shows are awesome.. I wish that Nickeloden would release all of those for us kids who grew up watching those shows!!! PLEASE NICK!!!!Carly
5,We're Waiting!!!!!,"This show was one of many of my faviorate Nickelodeon shows of the 90's. To see it again on DVD would make my days a whole lot better. I don't watch Nickelodeon now because the shows on that station belong to a new generation of Nickelodeon fans. But have heart for those who watched Salute Your Shorts, You Can't DoThat on Television and many more. We're asking for it! But we're still waiting to get it!!"
5,Camp Anawanna We hold you in our heats....... :),"Hey, come on please put the old shows on dvd format. We all would be very greatfull. Anyway, please help Get the '90's snick back. PPPPLLLLLLEEEEEEAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSEEEE!THANKS!!!!!!!"
2,Ehhhhh. Just OK. No results for me.,"Having been recommended this by a dermatologist's office for help with my dark under eye circles, I bought this with reservations (there's no such thing as a miracle product, right?). I have been very dedicated with this stuff, using it morning and night, and cannot say I see any notable difference, even after three month's use. The product does go a long way, but it hasn't done anything for me. I should have saved myself the money, because hope doesn't come in a bottle (or a vial, as it were)."
3,Not My Favorite Book,"This classic coffee table book features prominent villages in Provence. The birdseye photography is lovely, but this collection could benefit from pictures that take you into the town and show the reader what makes each one distinct. I own a half dozen books that profile French gardens, homes and interiors - this is not my favorite book."
4,"Good bike, but no instructions for decorations","This is a nice bike, but too many decorations get in the way of putting the bike together. Also, there is a piece of foam with no directions on where to put it. And I tried to put it everywhere. And to put the training wheels on you have to squeeze the plastic that covers the chain. So I don't know how long it will last."
3,short term bike,"This bike took forever to arrive- over 2 weeks beyond the est. time of arrival (past our son's 3rd birthday) - so dissapointing. The bike itself was heavy, and arrived with two large scratches ( down to the metal)and as several people have said only instructions for 'a bike' ( not THIS bike) to assemble.My 3 yr old ( who is 38"" tall) can ride it - but he looks very cramped with his knees near the handle-bars. we will need to buy him a new bike next year! It is very heavy to manouvre/carry. BUT it looks great!"
5,Great bike...but.,"I was putting the bike together and the forks would not fit on the front wheel. I had to bring it to a bike shop and they literally bent out the forks so it would fit. (guess it bent in shipping) Not a big deal, but should not have to bend the forks out on a new bike. Otherwise, he loves it and no issues at all."
2,Lightning McQueen 12,Bought two for my niece's [..] twin boys (average size)who are devoted fans of the Cars movie. Their physical therapist said the pipe extension on the seat wasn't long enough to give them full leg extension when peddling. I ordered it before Christmas due to high demand even though it was for their birthday on 1/29. Just found out it is not eligible for return or exchange for a larger one. So my niece will need to take the seats to a bike shop to have a longer pipe put on. Just hope it doesn't throw the whole thing out of balance.I'm disappointed since it is just two days beyond the holiday gift deadline. I just hope the boys will be able to ride it.
4,Cute but not for my son.,"My son is three... I bought this for his third birthday thinking that he would love it. He personally still likes his trike better. He is tall for three and once he sat on it I thought ""Man I should have gotten the bigger one!"" My son can't seem to get the hang of how these pedals work even though he can ride other kids bikes no prob. The instructions I thought were also very hard to understand. There were directions for all sorts of different bikes in the same booklet... from mountain bikes to bmx bikes.. and none for tike bikes so I kinda had to just flip back and forth and figure it out on my own. I'm pretty handy and it took me quite awhile.All in all I would say go for the size up if you are getting it for a 3 year old... My son already looks grown out of it."
1,Don't waste your time !!,"Don't waste your time. This book is a history of ""conventional"" treatments of autoimmune disorders and a synopsis of ""my treatment"" , hence the author's treatment. I lost count how many times he mentioned his own medical center and how he treats patients with chelation and detoxification from our our environmental chemicals we find in our lives that cause us to be sick.Nothing new here at all and it reads like a big, fat commercial for his center. You will not feel empowered by reading this only bored or mostly annoyed.I was NOT impressed."
1,Same..same.. same,"The ""trick"" to the ""drug free"" therapies for each category listed is basically the same, and people concerned about what they eat and personal health already know this stuff. Searching the internet for information on these disorders is more helpful than this book."
1,Pure quackery - worse than snake oil,"This book is a repository of a litany of scares and pure quackery, much of which has been debunked by research and clinical trials decades ago. Autoimmune diseases cannot be treated by any of its bizarre misrepresentations."
2,The Author has Lost His License,"When I checked out the author's ""Edelson Center"" online, I found that his license had been pulled in Georgia & the clinac shutdown. Also, Quackwatch reported several malpractice suits from autism patients. Apparently his ""cures"" actually did not work."
3,Alternative Treatments for Autoimmune Conditions,"For me, this book was a more holistic supplement to Mary J. Shomon's book, Living Well with Autoimmune Disease. It is logically formatted and is an easy resource for the specific condition about which one wishes to learn. The plus is it offers medical treatment and counters with non-drug treatment options for autoimmune conditions. A glossary and an appendix add to its value as a resource.Rebecca Jacoby, copywriterwww.afewchosenwords.comwww.beckyjacoby.com"
5,John Hoover carvings,Beautiful book of Hoovers native art. His Bio and the levels of his art changing creations.
3,good instructor but poor video quality...,Great instructor and demonstration on key techniques on product rendering but the video resolution is so poor that I couldn't even recognize the toolbox icons. And I can't find the extra 40 min bonus material and a minute of his sample work is all I can find on DVD. Prior knowledge on Photoshop is must because the flow of instruction runs fast for a beginner to understand. I don't think I will make another purchase from same publisher.
2,Dissapointing Sequel to NBA Showtime!,"This game is not better than last year's edition. In fact, it has even manage to fail in several areas that are well-done in last year's NBA Showtime. The only positives I can think of this game are a few added extras including new moves such as alley-oops, more secret courts, and more players. The gameplay remains the same overall. What I don't like is the horrible music that plays in the background. It can drive you insane after 5 minutes! Also, the graphics are worse with players that look awkwardly long with skinny legs! The colors are very dull compare to last year's game. During the game players constantly flicker and sometimes they even become transparent! This game is not fun to play because of the annoying music and bad graphics. I would advise getting NBA Showtime instead if you like arcade basketball games for your Game Boy Color!"
3,Not a Big Improvement!,"This game is not very different from last year's game, NBA Showtime. There are a few more moves and changes including updated rosters. In addition, the game is now 3-on-3 instead of 2-on-2. The gameplay remains almost the same overall. However, there are more extras in this game including more secret courts and players. The only two things that are noticeably worse than last year's edition are graphics and sounds. Players move very smoothly but they look very long and skinny! The colors are also not very bright and make the game look dull. Even worse, players flicker and become transparent on the court! The background music is horrible! It makes you want to smash the game the first time you play it! The sound effects are very tinny and become rather annoying, as well. If you have played NBA Showtime then this game is not worth it. I only recommend this game if you don't have last year's game and can put up with the terrible music of this game!"
3,It's ok,My son could not LIVE without this game-so we bought it! Now-he can't find it. Didn't hold his interest for very long!
4,Not A Bad Basketball Game!,"This game is pretty fun to play. On the court you can do a lot of dunks including 360 dunks, summersault dunks, and dunks from the 3-point line. You can also spin and do alley-oops. The fast paced 3-on-3 action is sure to please fans of the arcade style basketball."
4,A Pretty Cool Basketball Game!,This game is cool because you can do many NBA Jam style moves such as high flying dunks and alley-oops. The only thing I don't like about this game is the annoying background music. If you like having fun playing basketball then this game is for you.
3,Sigh. I was expecting more.,"I've been a fan of Andre Norton for 30 years, so I'll read any tale she cares to tell. However, in this book, her collaborator has managed to drag things down to the level of a mediocre read-once-only and pass along regency romance. Whoever allowed the inclusion of those stupid little footnotes (I agree with another reviewer-they have to be Ms Edgehill's) made a really BAD decision on this. They frequently define words I can figure out quite well from context-if I can't, I know what a dictionary is. One footnote to a scene set in New Orleans directs us to a website for jambalaya recipes. Who got paid for that lovely bit of advertising and how much? I feel like they were aimed at really dumb little kids. But even Andre's YA readers are smarter than THAT. Read the library copy before buying on this one."
2,Just disappointing,"Like other reviewers I hoped to get more out of the sequel after reading Shadow of Albion, and I like Edghill. But the paperback, even with fewer footnotes, was hard going.The threads never came together satisfactorily and the plot was ridiculous. I don't mind christianity vs satanism in a book butin this one it made the characters extremely one-dimensional and just didn't gel with the magic mixed with voodoo.How is Sarah supposed to prevent the People's decimation with or without the Sahoya's help? Why is the chief's son courting her? What exactly did the Grail do? The book raised loads of questions and answered none--the authors would have done better taking out most of these plot devices.I'll read other books by both authors--just not the ones they co-author."
2,This cd was ok,This cd was pretty good if you like classical music by the composers. Not the best though.
5,How The West Was Stolen,Very informative and the author seems to state the true history.Poems and songs were great.
1,Wasted talent,"John Leventhal has once again successfully sabotaged his ex-girlfriend's career by over-producing the arrangements on this sugar-coated, contrived and utterly boring record. A psychotherapist would have a field day examining this bizarre partnership. Unfortunately, Shawn Colvin's fans suffer. There is nothing on this record to differentiate Shawn from the rest of the banal female singers that flood the airwaves. That's a terrible shame because Shawn is so gifted, and her talents are completely wasted. While her lyrics may still be full of wit, irony, and elusiveness, Leventhal's arrangements turn it all to a muddy mess. Do yourself a favor and pass on this CD. Instead, listen to Steady On, Fat City, and Covergirl to fully appreciate one of the most gifted singer-songwriters of the last fifteen years."
4,Wonderful,"I've only had time to listen to this all the way through twice and, while I don't think it's as stong as A Few Small Repairs, it's growing on me and is definitely a strong album."
1,Whole New You by Shawn Colvin,"CD does not play in any of my car CD players. I have contacted Amazon customer service and I have been told they are sending me a replacement.Sorry Rating 0 Stars. Order for this item originated September 5, 2011.Best Regards,Roberts S. Kis"
2,Before You Buy This CD. . .,"If you've never owned a Shawn Colvin CD before, this is not the one to buy. ""Fat City"" is the title of Shawn's best. It blows all of her others out of the water. If after buying ""Fat City,"" you still want this one, fine. But buy ""Fat City"" first. I own several hundred CDs, and Shawn Colvin's ""Fat City"" is in the top 5. This new one, however, is just so-so. If you're like me, you'll spend too much time skipping over too many songs to hear the too few better ones. On ""Fat City,"" it's ALL good. It's fantastic."
4,WHOLE NEW YOU A TONED DOWN EFFORT!,"The latest release by Shawn Colvin, WHOLE NEW YOU, has many high points and a few tracks that would have been better left on the cutting room floor. To me, the three highlights on this album are as follows.....A MATTER OF MINUTES, WHOLE NEW YOU, and ROGER WILCO. These tracks are very melodic with some great lyrics and her voice seems to flow like a river into the sea. While the rest of the album is also very beautifully executed in terms of her vocal instrument and production, at times it is too toned down. I thought with this album Miss Colvin would have continued where A FEW SMALL REPAIRS left off but she is going in a totally different direction. While I find that admirable, it will just take me some time to get used to her new more reserved sound. This is a great cd for a rainy day or a nice road trip! Enjoy the highlights!"
4,"Sorry, but I really liked it","Maybe it's because this is the first CD by Colvin I've ever owned, but I really liked it. I knew her Sunny Came Home from the radio, but bought this through one of those ubiquitous, customers who bought this also... at the bottom of a review I was reading. I clicked ahead, listened to some of the snippets, liked them enough to buy the CD. I liked it a lot the first listen, and by the third time, I was really listening. I love songs that you need to listen to, and this CD has been a really great one to actually pay attention to the words. I play it over and over, and love Colvin's voice and lyrics. If this collection is such a let down, I cannot imagine how wonderful her other albums are, but I intend to find out."
2,"Frankly, I Preferred The ""Old"" You!","I have been a fan of Shawn Colvin's music since her first release,Steady On, back in the late 80s. This is the only item in her impressive catalogue that fails to grab me, even after repeated listenings. Without actually looking at the CD booklet, I wouldn't be able to name a single song on it, off the top of my head. This does not mean that the album is bad, by any means, but it is not to my taste. I feel justified in saying that it is certainly not up to the quality of her other work. I recommend insteadA Few Small Repairs, which remains her strongest collection. Fortunately, Ms. Colvin's latest release,These Four Walls, is also superb, and represents a return to form."
2,Top 1000 Reviewers can be wrong !,"Could not disagree more with the lead review for this album. Fans of Shawn Colvin will have loved her early work and took in ""Repairs"" as a breath of fresh pop air. Whole New You goes too far from her roots and too close to pop trivia, bar a few star tracks that we'll buy this for anyway.But, to get closer to Shawn, buy Cover Girl - contrary to the Top 1000 reviewer, who by definition, listens to a whole heap of stuff and doesn't specialise in backlist, this album is far closer to her soul than anything. Half of it is live, most of it unplugged, all of it what she loves listening to and performing. Wake up and smell the coffee...."
5,She's done it again...,"There's always that moment of fear when an artist you admire and have overplayed releases another album. Will it be any good? Will I be disappointed? Surely it can't be as good as the last one? Well, bury your doubts because it's as good if not better than 'A Few Small Repairs'. I'm thrilled to bits with this new album, every song is a pleasure to listen to and there's a mixture of feelings as you listen through it. Writing, arrangement, production, lyrics and the way it makes you feel are all pretty damn near perfect. This is destined to be a classic."
2,"Nice, but no punch","Where is the energy from Shawn Colvin's previous works? Well, it's been evaporated by the production work of John Leventhal. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Leventhal worked magic with Rosanne Cash's recordings. But that technique dampens the spirit of Ms. Colvin's songs. I prefer the earlier recordings of Shawn Colvin to this one."
5,It's A Charmer- Snatch It Up!,"Shawn Colvin has offered up a terriffic new album with WHOLE NEW YOU. The editorial review made me a little concerned that she had decided to join the world of punk or rap music and that we should all run like the wind from this album. Rest assured, this is the same old Shawn singing in her same wonderful way. Enjoy playing this body of work, and know with confidence that you are receiving the soul-filled folk sound that we love from this woman."
3,Not her best work,"I was overall disappointed by this album. I agree with other reviewers that it is too slickly produced, and most of the lyrics lack the depth of those on ""A Few Small Repairs"" and ""Steady On."" There are some good songs on the album, ""A Matter of Minutes"" being my favorite, but many just don't stand out after repeated listenings. The title track is just awful.I wish Shawn would return to her acoustic roots and to the intelligent pop of ""A Few Small Repairs."" She's a talented musician and songwriter, and I'd like to see better material from her than this album."
4,What's all the fuss about?,"I am a bit surprised to read all of these damning reviews of Shawn Colvin's new album 'Whole New You'. In my opinion Shawn has tried new and different things with every album she's done. Whole New You only marks another change. Is an artist not allowed to change and evolve? Isn't that what art and creation is about? Whilst I don't think Whole New You is by any means a masterpiece, I do think it is a skilfully crafted collection of evocative and tuneful songs. A Matter Of Minutes is a superbly crafted and original work. And as far as getting away from her roots is concerned, I think Whole New You is perfectly in line with Shawn's other albums, however the production style has changed slightly to a slicker, more contemporary feel. The guitars are still in there. Do you people have ears? If you like well crafted, easy-going adult contemporary with a confessional twist, buy any Shawn Colvin album, including Whole New You."
2,Overproduced and very disappointing,"I've been a long-time fan of Shawn Colvin's, and I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed in this new release. I recognize that artists change and evolve, but she seems to be heading in a direction that's more designed to ensure her [money] and mucho radio play as opposed to why I fell in love with her in the first place, namely spare arrangements that allowed her voice to come through. There's not much heart in this CD. It seems listless and angry."
3,It's hard to follow up success,"And this album certainly proves it.*Whole New You* is Shawn's follow up album to A Few Small Repairs, but her life had changed dramatically. She's now a Top-40 artist, and a new mom. Neither of those pressures are easy.This album is, in my opinion, rather dark. Her songwriting still rings true, but it's not the album I was hoping for, or want to listen to.She has since come out with a couple of new albums which bring us back to the Shawn Colvin we've come to love."
2,Great Background Music,"Well there is nothing to be critical of here. The music is competent and intelligently written--performed like the true professional Colvin has become. Colvin as always uses the limited range of her voice to great effect (as perfected on the breakout unlikely smash, ""A Few Small Repairs""). The tracks lack individual distinction but blend beautifully into the background of your work day or car ride. No hit singles here and this one will fly well below the pop music radar....but its not bad, I swear! If you need something with a little more PLUCK try Jess Kleins' fabulous ""Draw Them Near""--an up and coming Colvin to be for sure."
4,Short but Sweet,"Shanw Colvin's newest release ""Whole New World"" is a step down in intensity from her grammy-winning 1996 release ""A Few Small Repairs"" but is worth owning, nonetheless. It doesn't have any tracks that sound like radio hits except the title track, but it does have the musical texture and lyrical depth required to make it memorable. The ache in her voice is just as alluring as ever and the songs will tug at your heart. My chief complaint is that the CD is VERY short in length. Excellent production from John Leventhal and a must-have for your CD collection."
2,Disappointed,"I have been a huge Shawn Colvin fan for almost 15 years, but I am more than a little disappointed with ""Whole New You"". When I listen to a Shawn Colvin album, I want to hear Shawn sing wonderful lyrics and play her acoustic guitar - either alone or with a background that highlights that singing and playing. John Leventhals backgrounds are overproduced, making the vocals seem hidden or less important. It seems that this album is more about Leventhal, and less about Shawn. Many of the songs seem disjointed, often jumping abruptly between verse, chorus and bridge - as if each section of the song was written separately and patched together later.I was hoping this album would grow on me, but not so far. All I can say is that I can't wait for her next album, to see if she can gain control of the musical focus of her own career.Better luck next time."
5,"If you love ""A Few Small Repairs"" you'll love this CD","It's pretty easy to see when you read these reviews that there are two types of Shawn Colvin fans: The folksy late 80s Shawn fans and the Grammy winning John Leventhal conspiring Shawn fans.I have every one of her CDs. I bought them after I became entranced with ""A Few Small Repairs"". Frankly, her earlier efforts, while good, didn't quite do it for me. ""A Whole New You"" is truly in the same ballpark as her grammy effort.If you thought ""A Few Small Repairs"" was a sellout then I suggest you save your money or buy a Mary Chapin Carpenter CD instead."
5,Recommended for children whose parents want to prepare them for the arrival of a new baby in the family,"Young Oliver is angry. His mother is giving away his high char and crib to the new baby that is coming to live with them. Oliver can't even sit on his mom's lap because her tummy has grown too big. Oliver is so angry he feels like throwing his mom in the garbage can, or running away and living in his tree house. There is just no room for a new baby in his life. But when momma reminds him that there are perks to being a big brother, Oliver decides to stick around and share his wisdom with the new baby. Originally published in 1979 and featuring recolored art by author/illustrator Martha Alexander, When The New Baby Comes, I'm Moving Out is an ideal book which is enthusiastically recommended for children whose parents want to prepare them for the arrival of a new baby in the family."
1,My 3 year old screamed in terror.,"I got this book from our local library and did not read it before reading it to my 3 year old daughter. When we got to the part about the boy putting the mother in the trashcan, not feeding her, beating the can with a stick, and taking it to the dump, my 3 year old freaked out and started screaming. She was absolutely terrified. I told her it was just pretend and we finished the book to see what happened but the book never really got much better and didn't go into detail about all the great things older siblings get to do. It just provided pictures of the older brother holding the baby while the mother watched soap operas and the older brother staying up late to watch a late night talk show--both kind of inappropriate since I don't what my child to think she has to watch her sibling so that I can watch television or that she gets to stay up until midnight. Terrible, horrible book."
1,Absolutely Awful Book,"This book is absolutely AWFUL for children. I thought this would be cute to read to my son. Well, if he wasn't previously having issues with a new baby coming he might after reading this book!! The book definitely gives plenty of bad examples for little ones and is NOT humorous! Don't waste your money or worse, taint your children with this book!!"
5,A Thrilling Commentary,"I reccomend this book for anyone; New Yorker or not, who is interested in the current trends in this economy, including the selling of our nation's great art and humanity to pave the way for malls. A thrilling story with wonderful research, not to mention well-written by an intelligent person who I admire most for telling the truth.Peace Be With You, Brett Somers"
5,Brilliant! Genous! AWSOME!,Okay so i dont have the cd yet but from the songs i hear..WOW..I cant beleive these guys dont have a big fan site yet and a place for them to gather..can we say VNV nation/Velvet acid Christ big? ya i think we can.. Damn good music DAMN GOOD! WOW..wish i was this good man..i may try to do my own music editing but damn im no where near THIS DAMN GOOD..YOU GUYS TOTALLY ROCK BRILLANCE!!Love the tones the beats everything about the music is sheer dark beauty twisted on its own awsome beats pounding loud and deep..What songs they make i know they will ROCK
4,Nice Headphones,"I've had an pair of these since 2003. They have a great sound, and not too much bass. My only pet peeve about them is the cost of accessories. Five pairs of gray ear tips is 14.00 and the extra filters (necessary every once and a while) are 15.00 for a package of 6. The markup for the accessories has to be amazing, and increases the total cost of ownership over time.Other than that, I think they're great for running and working out as long as you don't mind the expense of maintaining the filters, etc."
5,Etymotic ER-4P Review,"Fantastic product, great sound and fantastic noise isolation. Much better thatn the Bose Noise Cancelling porducts. Provides great sound isolation without coloring the sound the way Bose, or any active noise canceling product, does.Had ER-4's for fourteen years, they finally gave out, over 4 million air miles. Bought the ER-4P's and like them even more with my iPod."
3,"Like a tin can, no bass...","These have amazingly clear highs. But the lowend gets distorted at only half volume on a non-bassy song. I turned the bass down and fixed the problem but was left with only the high-end. I ended up buying e5c's which have a much fuller sound to them but lack the clarity of the ety's. I thought I would mind the lack of clarity, but in the end I enjoyed the e5c's more."
2,Great sound... But that's it.,"Pros: Great sound, probably the best I've heard in a headphone.Cons: Everything else.I mean, really. I was a little surprised to open up the box and see these headphones in there. They look more or less like something that is put together by a 12 year old. Cheap and nondurable is what came to my mind.Another issue i've had with them is that you cannot put the cord over your ear, which insures that the headphone will stay in. They look goofy when you have them in, due to the cable being almost always erect and sticking out. I don't understand why they weren't engineered to go over the ears. For this sum of money I believe these are definitely not worth it.Summary: They sound great, but everything else is surpassed by other headphones and better engineering."
2,"Go with the Shure headphones, you'll be sure glad you did!","These headphones do an excellent job of cancelling out background noise and its nice that they come with a box full of optional earplugs. The headphones came out in 2004, which i'm sure at that time were amazing headphones. But it is 2009 and I believe that Etymotic should redesign their headphones. These headphones are no match for the Shure SE420's. When you wear these headphones you will feel like Frankenstein because they stick out from your ears so awkwardly. I sent mine back and am now using the Shures."
2,Overrated,"The short and not so sweet- IMO, these earphones are simply not what most of the reviews would suggest. Are they better than earbuds? Yes they are. Are they audiophile quality? Not in the least. The bass response is iffy at best, and they have a tendency to sound overly bright in the high range. I use them with my I pod as most others will, and I import music at 320kbps, so I offer these phones the best opportunity to shine and they have proved to me to be marginal. That said, the price is not ridiculous for what you get but if you are really looking for high end response you will have to look further. I find that many people make up their minds about a product before they buy it, and even in the face of contrasting reality will still swear allegiance to an inferior piece of gear. I am not one of those. You will get what you pay for."
2,"No bass, good mids and highs",I am returning my set for refund. I bought these for my Samsung mp3 player. The base from the headphones included with the player is better. The documentation says to make sure you have a good fit or you will not hear the base and have a weak or tinny sound. I tried both types of the included inserts and I could not get them to work for me. I tested them for several hours trying to get a good deep base. After spending this much for a set of headphones I really wanted them to work. Got a few second opinions from the family and they all agreed the base was just not there compared to the Samsung headphones that came with the player. Sending them back.
2,not what i expected,I bought these and a set of the Shure e4c headphones. These are smaller but they sounded tinny on the high end. I ended up returning these and buying a second pair of the e4c for my wife.
5,Amazing Headphones for the Average Joe,"These are luxurious headphones for any music lover, and the noise-cancellation is excellent.-- I use these on plane rides. They cancel noise so effectively that I arrive feeling _very_ notably more rested than I did before I had them.-- The sound quality is amazing. If you're not an audiophile and you simply love music, these earbuds are a real treat: you will hear things you haven't heard before, and even when you just wanna rock, they sound super.-- I broke mine once and called the factory. Sent them back and they repaired them no charge. Lesson? When you buy something this pricey, it's an investment and not a throwaway... and Etymotic knows that too.I've had mine for about four years now and I couldn't be happier with them. I would buy new ones in a second if these broke--even at twice the price.Buy em and don't look back. You won't regret it."
4,Great!,"I work in a very noisy Jr. High school and I needed something that was portable, sound good, and could cut out most of the external noise around me. I tried several top noise reduction headphones , (except the Bose), and none worked well in that environment. Some gave me headaches, most were too bulky and clumsy with external battery cases dangling everywhere and, I could still hear the noise drowning out the music. But the Etymotic ER-4P were great. They are very portable, sound is clear and balanced, though if you like ear defining, brain damaging bass, these are not the ear buds for you, also if you are not comfortable with things in your ear you may want to choose something else. But, if you like great sound and a noisy environment turned off, these are for you. They sound great on my ipod touch and nano, I also us them in the studio when I record."
4,Why the 50% price increase?,"These are fantastic ear phones for travel. Be aware the sound suppression effect is similar to using ear plugs, so if there's no sound playing you will hear yourself eat, breathe, move about etc.I bought my set four years ago and just now as I was changing the filters I noticed the little plastic end that holds the filter has cracked. It's not the end of the world as the ear pieces go over this part and will hold everything together. I thought I would jump online to see if the price had come down and perhaps just buy a new set. But they're 50% MORE EXPENSIVE! Exact same model. What's that all about?"
2,Expected better durability for the price,"No complaints about the sound quality of these earphones, but for the price, I expected better durability. Until recently, I only used the phones on occasion when traveling and such. But after recently joining a gym, I put them to more use, and consequently put them to the real test. Unfortunately, I can't say they past the test because after a few months of workouts, one of the phones shorted out and no longer produces any audio. I would not pay this kind of money again for what amounts to a disposable product."
4,ER 4P,"Excellent ear phone for the money. maybe slightly lean in bass, but overall a fantastic value. Recommend using Westone Comply ear tips for the best comfort and fit."
3,"Good, but still not great bass.","After reading all the reviews, I took a chance and bought the 4P. The presence is simply amazing and they're a lot more comfortable than I had anticipated. And they are loud! I've been searching for earphones that delivered isolation, a well-rounded sound and comfort, and thought I'd found them in the 4P model. I had previously owned the Etymotic 6i and found the bass lacking. The 4P delivers more bass, but less than I had expected. I have been using Sony's MDR-NC11A for about a year and, to my ears, they produce less presence than the 4P but seem to deliver a ""bassier"" yet not muddy bass sound, and cost about half the price of the 4P.PS - the 4P model shown on Amazon with the red and blue earpieces has been replaced by pure a black model, making distinguishing the left from the right very difficult."
3,"Good earphones, but costly and not the best","Good high definition earphones, however value/price ratio is suffering...Problems: Sound is somewhat not very live; not enough bass - even for classical music.The ""noisy"" cord problem really kills the thing."
2,Noise and Distortion is what you'll get...........,"If you listen to high fidelity classical recordings forget about it. Otherwise, they worked pretty well for pop/rock music. I have returned these earphones back to Amazon.com and will be purchasing the Ultimate Ears .5 series instead."
2,Definitely not worth the price!,"I returned this product after only an hour of use. They just didn't sound any better than the Ipod ear buds that I have. In addition, every time the cord would rub up against clothing or anything for that matter, it made an awful sound."
1,ER 4 review,These are among the worst sounding earphones I've heard. There's absolutely no bass. I listen to audiophile recordings which usually have good bass. When I listen to these earphones they sound like I'm listening to an old transister radio from the 60's. I bought these based on the rave reviews. Either people have no critical hearing or I have a defective pair. The cheap headphones that came with my ipod sound better.
1,"waste of money, barely deserves one start","again a typical Fabozzi publication, which is printed on cheap paper although the hefty price would have allowed for a use of higher quality paper.But most of all, this book does not explain in required detail the distributions nor generating functions. This is for someone who wants to learn some term-dropping without profound insight.RECOMMENDATION: TO LEARN, BUT ANOTHER BOOK. FABOZZI PUBLICATIONS ARE ALWAYS THE SAME, SUPERFLUOUS AND EXPENSIVE."
2,Little Help For the Ordinary Investing Stiff,As a reader of Rachev and co's earlier work 'Stable Paretian Models in Finance' this work is admittedly about halfway down from the mathematical stratosphere where the former floated. If anyone knows of a work which can clearly and convincingly explain the implications of this work for the mug punter please let me know at jenpalex@actapple.org.au.Paul Mason
3,look inside,"One can read the ToC and the first chapter (introduction) with Amazon's ""look inside"" feature/service. I think this lets one make good estimate of the book's level and depth of coverage, and to decide if the book meets one's needs."
5,"Like a book on tape, except its a video.","As some negative reviews exclaim, ""Dr. Seuss's ABC"" is just like reading the book. It's the exact pictures (given some minor animation), and verbatim words from the books. If your kid is used to watching vivid animation or violent cop drama or the like, this may not hold his attention. My son finds it soothing and does pay attention to all three stories. He is 2.5 years old and this video has helped him learn to sing the ABC song. It may not be as nice as you reading the books to your kids, but when its time to do the cooking/laundry/dishes, you could do a lot worse than putting this 1/2 hour show on for them."
1,Mangleing the good doctor,"Not at all a good version of Dr Seuss's beloved classics... while I've seen the ""point the camera at the book"" type of production done well, this isn't it. The story is read in a long, dragging tone obviously meant to drag out a very short story. The producers also decided they were talented enough to re-write parts of the book, and fail miserably. While your kids may still enjoy this, for anyone who truely loves the pacing and colorful wording of a Dr Seuss story, you're much better off getting a copy of the book and reading it to your kids, than watching this pitiful production"
3,Not at all like the book!,"Luckily I only checked this video out from the library. I was very disappointed and so was my son. I read the Dr. Seuss ABC book to him almost daily and he LOVES it. I was hoping that this DVD would mirror the book. Sadly, it does not. ""Mr. Brown Can Moo..."" is also included in this DVD and it also does not follow the book version.My son usually loves seeing his books on DVD because the characters are animated and he will chime in and say the lines that he remembers. Because this version is so different from the book, he lost interest right away.I am giving this DVD 3 stars because I still think that it does have some educational value for children learning their ABC's, but I think my son and I will just stick to the book! : )"
4,Dr Seuss ABC video,My son is autistic and loves the Dr. Seuss series. The ABC video is one of his favorites.
1,Anti-educational in the extreme,"I am not an anti-TV person. I have no problems letting my toddler watch a few movies a day. [I have found that the Wiggles are the best.] However, I don't want to educate my children to watch the movie instead of reading the book.This movie adds absolutely nothing to the original books. It is very poorly done, and looks like they just show page after page of the original books.So why bother with this? It is far better to sit down with your child and read that actual books to them."
1,A big disappointment,"This video was not animated like the classic Chuck Jones features such as ""The Cat In The Hat"" and ""The Grinch"". My daughter was rather disappointed to see the camera scanning over pages of the books she already owns along with paper cutouts of the characters floating around as a cheap replacement for animation. We give this video a thumbs down."
4,A great supplement to the book,"My toddler can't get enough of Dr. Seuss's ABC book. The video does a great job of reinforcing what the book is teaching. Not only does my baby hear the book being read in a whole new voice, but the words & letters appear on the screen in sync w/the narration.The other 2 stories on the video aren't done as well in that the text never appears on screen.But it was worth purchasing for the ABC story alone. Just consider the other stories as bonus ""cartoons."" The verses are still Dr. Seuss after all!"
4,=(,"Aimee was the deeply troubling story of a girls attempt to cope with her best friends suicide, while she is being accused of assisting. Beautifully written, the author reveals what happend that night in little bits throughout the story. Although a wonderfull work of literature, its deeply troubling."
2,Not sure yet,"I read about 90 pages into this book and decided not to finish it.My problem is that this book reads too much like an adult trying to sound like a teen. The main character seems all too stereotypical and her choice of words just doesn't sound like anyone I have heard... too contrived and forced. The characters just aren't believeable. Another thing I noticed is the typical scenario of teen-girl-track-star-with-an-overworking mother. I have no idea why, but I can think of 3 different books, aside from this one, where the main character runs track and has a mother who works too much. Is this the formula for YA fiction??This may be a good book but I can't get past the overproduction."
5,Grabs you from the moment you see the cover.,"I was given this book for Christmas. I didn't expect it to be any good, but I was wrong. From the very first page, questions rose from my mind. But the most prominant question was - WHY didn't I read it sooner?This is the story about a group of friends torn apart by one tragic night of poor decisions and a life time of anyting but happy endings.Aimee was the victim of sexual child abuse.Zoe was the victim of a friendship that couldn't win.While reading, you're bound to form questions in your mind. Write them down, as see just how quickly they're answered. I garuntee it'll be quickly.MaryBeth Miller has a style of writing I've been yearning for in the mix of boring young adult dramas. Her unique voice touches, GRABS you and rips you in to the world of Zoe.One thing is for sure.You won't forget Zoe or Aimee after you read."
4,A unique and interperative way of life is portrayed here,"In this very ""unusual"" yet exciting style of writing, Mary Beth Miller draws her readers quickly into her book AIMEE. The techinique of flash backs and memories flooding through the main characters mind make for an all together wondeful plot. Readers will share some of the most intimate and personal thoughts of a teenager as she deals with friends, family, triumph, love, loss, heartbreak, and death.I enjoyed this exteremly deep and meaningful plot. Although it was difficult at first to keep track of the story due to all the time changes, (presnt to past, constantly switching) it wasn't long before until I found myself yearing for more. Chard, Kyle, Kates, Jason, and Amiee soon enough become more like your own friends that strangers. They find a place inside your heart where I am sure they will stay for a time to come.Overall a really well written book that is worth reading. I am looking forward to reading more books From Miller in the future."
4,deep and moving book,"Everyone believes that Zoe helped her best friend, Aimee, commit suicide - even though she was acquitted. Her parents moved to the next town to escape the social stigma, and Zoe is completely cut off from her friends and forced to go to therapy. Through painful journal entries, Zoe conveys lonliness, hurt, and anger. She starts paralyzed with fear, and gradually lets out more as she recovers, and she changes from ""Aimee's alleged murderer"" to herself. This book is very moving and very well-written."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,This book related personally to me. I felt everything Zoe felt through the whole book. To know that other people in the world feel the same way I do about life is refreshing and helpful. Now I know that it is okay to feel depressed and sucicidal...and that I can get through it. Zoe's relationship with her parents and her counseler reflect how many teenagers today feel but are too afraid to cope with. Now I feel that I can cope with these problems thanks to this book. Aimee will stay with me forever.
4,Too many previews,"The Andy Griffith Show is one of my favorites and I was very excited to add this five disc set to my collection. I was disappointed, however, in the amount of previews on the first disc. Each time you play the disc you must watch at least five previews of other shows. There is the option of advancing through each of them but you still have to watch at least the beginning of each preview. I would like to suggest the previews be part of the main menu. Other than the preview issue, I am enjoying watching these classic reruns."
5,Classic comedy,"This season of Andy Griffith is a classic hit! With my all-time favorite episode ""The Pickle Story,"" season 2 on DVD is a knockout."
4,The Second Season set,"The show was the elderly parent's favorite from 1960s USA television. I ultimately bought one collection each, of the first five three seasons. The product and materials used are completely satisfactory."
4,A good choice,"If you're a fan of the Andy Griffith Show this is a good set to buy. At least by the second season Andy was not acting like a country buffoon as he die in the first season. His constant badgering of Barney Pfife was very over done. I'd have to admit that if I was from the south especially North Carolina, I would have been quite offended by the ""Andy"" character. The only redeaming quality of the show was the genuine comedic talent of Don Knotts, (the real reason we watched), and the other supporting characters. Don't get me wrong, I think ""The Andy Griffith Show"" was one of the best series on TV ever, but not necessarily because of Andy Griffith."
4,KEROSENE CUCUMBERS!,Another great season and they added the sponser spots this time! Would have liked to see more bonus material added. This is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5! All in all it's a great show and the set is very good. The pickle story is one of my favorites.
5,Excellent,"Great picture quality. Worth the price. LOVE the commercials. It has the original uncut commercials with Andy and the others doing them. Takes us back, love this season."
5,Great DVD,If you are an Andy Griffith Show fan this is a must. I really liked the commercials that I have seen. I can not wait for the 3rd season that will be available in August.
5,The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Second Season,"The DVD is excellent quality, and the show is the best!! If you are an Andy Griffith fan, this is a MUST HAVE!"
4,"Great, but....","Great collection, I absolutely love it. The only downside are the other DVD advertisments in the beginning (Brady Bunch etc.). Season One didn't have them, season two does. Unfortunately, you have to listen for 5 minutes to what else they want you to buy - and you can't stop it while waiting desperately for Andy Griffith to begin."
5,Good Wholesome Entertainment from the Past,"This a great collection of Andy Griffith Show episodes. Even after all these years they are very entertaining, funny and appropriate for the whole family."
3,Great show! Poor disc quality.,I love the Andy Griffith show! I have watched it in reruns for 40 years and have slowly collected DVD's of the seasons. Season 2 is great BUT at least 2 of the discs in my set are virtually un-playable. They arrived with some sort of sticky substance on the playing surface and I haven't been able to get them clean. I may need to return them if I can find the right info to do it.
5,andy's second season,"As with most TV shows on DVD, the second season is usually more enjoyable and this DVD didn't disappoint."
1,I'm not paying for commercials,"The shows are, of course, superb. And the added sponsor spots are a monstrous plus. But what is up with Paramount forcing me to sit through a bunch of commercials before I can watch the DVD that I bought and paid for? You just forever lost a client, Paramount. Don't buy this set."
2,no mighty gorgeous nor t-rex nor...,..serpent. good film q only on m. gorga-the better of these 2 shows. only good thing-m.g. scenes and trex scenes of egg bein thrown at it-funny and ending cheap fx dragon and the other film-scraped and ate a goyle via trex-this film grosse. the trailers were good extras you dont see most too often. lousy collection-not enough good looking creature action.
1,horrible,The cutter worked fine on the first 2 bottles I opened. After that it won't even cut through the foil of another bottle. I had a foil cutter from the rabbit opener that lasted for 2 yrs until the plastic broke in half. This one isn't worth it.
1,Useless - dont buy,Made of plastic and easily breaks with the smallest amount of force that is needed to press the blades against the foil. Broke after 3 uses.
1,Not convinced,I'm not convinced this stuff does anything for me at all.My suggestion would be to save your money and get some exercise.
5,For horse-lovers...,"It's a shame that this book is no longer readily available. It's one of the most entertaining stories I've read in a long time. The author really did his homework concerning thoroughbred horse racing. It is its own private world, not easily accessable to the general public. William Kinsolving did a wonderful job of weaving the factual world of racing and the fictional world of the characters together."
2,Not Impressed,"I'm sorry, I've read wonderful reviews of this book, and I'm not sure why. I kept reading it just because of the racing/horse subject matter, but the plot was so weak. There was more tragedy than I could keep up with and I was never able to like a character. I think in effort to keep the book dramatic, it just became overblown and exaggerated. I would not recommend it if you like an intelligent plot."
1,Bought 2 and they both died...,"My husband and I bought two of these and after using them for a little over a year (i.e. when they were no longer under warranty) they both developed the same problem of shutting off unexpectedly. Once they had shut off like this, we would have to let them ""rest"" for a few hours before they would turn on again. Eventually mine never turned on again.Viewsonic did nothing for us and we are stuck with 2 broken monitors. If you do a little research online, you will see otheres with similar complaints.Buyer beware..."
4,Great Monitor For The Buck!,"Got my VG150 last week, Worked great with windows XP out of the box. The updated driver from Viewsonics Website did not load properly so I chose to ignore it with no problems. Easy on the eyes and easy to use"
1,Problems with ViewSonic VG150,I received the ViewSonic VG150 today. I used it to replace a functioning monitor on a Hewlett Packard Pavilion computer. The screen remained black. The amber LED changed to a flashing green LED but the screen remained black. I called ViewSonic tech support and after trying various procedures I was advised to return the monitor to the place of purchase. I returned the monitor and would not feel comfortable purchasing this type of monitor in the future.
2,Big Disappointment,I really don't care for this CD at all. I listened to it the first time and didn't like it at all. Listened to a second...and now I know it's going to be one of those CD's that never gets played. A dust collector.
5,i want to own this dvd..all episodes !!!!,My son is now at the age I was when this was my favorite show. I would love to relive that time through his eyes. I think it be a great thing for us to share !!! Please release all episodes on dvd SOON !!!!
5,Bring back this show!!!,"I am thrilled to have found this show and many others from the early 80s on video, thanks to collectors. But it's still a crime that YCDTOTV isn't being syndicated for today's children. Everyone is so uptight. Children of my time related more to things like that than today's immoral, unethical and sarcastic television shows.But if and when this show comes out on DVD, expect it to be heavily edited and incomplete. There were many plugs for celebrities and it'll all be cut out due to today's ridiculous standards.Also, why is it that even back then Canada and England put out great kids' shows but not America? And America STILL doesn't.YCDTOTV, Third Eye series, and many other greats that were on Nick are out there with collectors, many including commercials. Your best bet on reliving the great past is to get it pre-recorded. Forget re-releases. They suck bad!!"
5,Great Show,"It is so sad that, like many other great shows, this show is not available on DVD. I'm also amazed that no one has brought the show back with a new generation of kids. It was such a great show, basically a children's version of The Carol Burnett Show. The budget of it had to be next to nothing, yet I still watched it whenever it was on. Today, we have all these big budget shows that just don't measure up.Please please please bring this series out on DVD so that we, and a brand new generation, can once again enjoy the simple pleasures of water, slime, firing squads, dungeons, classrooms, detention rooms with big dictionaries, Barth's restaurant, and a host of other goodies."
5,When Nick was the bomb!,"I was born in 1979, and Nick was a huge part of my life (as well as others my age). Nick was really great from the early 80's till the mid 90's. Some of the early 80's great shows I remember, ""you cant do that on television"", ""tommorrow people"", then the mid 80's ""cities of gold"", double dare"", ""noozles"", the 90's brought us ""Clarrissa explains it all"", ""Pete and Pete"", ""Are you afraid of the dark"", ""legends of the hidden temple"", ""Hey dude"", Salute you shorts"". Then all of a sudden, Nick, the disney channel, MTV, and many other stations turned to crap, all promoting a metro-sexual, self-absorbed and trivial lifestyle to teens of the new millenium. It's a shame, the quality of television has plumeted. Movies suck. politicians are more phoney then ever. There's nothing good about the 2000-2010 era... heck, we dont even have a name for it!"
5,You Can't do that on Shout! Factory!,"Old School Nickelodeon fans have waited too long for a You Can't do that on Television DVD. The show should be sold to Shout! Factory, along with other Nickelodeon shows of the 80s, and 90s! Please release You Can't do that on Television on DVD in 2009 for it's 30th Anniversary!"
2,Multifunction or Malfunction?,"This product is, in theory, a very useful multitask machine. Unfortunately, I've had quite a bit of trouble keeping it in working order. The ink ran out after what seemed to be very little use (though this, I'm afraid, may be typical of modern printers). Then, when I bought the replacement cartridge..., I still get the ""cartridge needs replacing"" message. ... overall I'm sorry I didn't get a basic printer and the other peripherals (scanner, fax) separately. I admit I'm far from being a techie, but these machines are supposed to be easy to use and this one doesn't fit that description at all."
4,It's a gasket.,I bought this for my 2006 Chevy Trailblazer and it works well. It did the job it was intended to do and that's all I can really say about it. Price was ok also.
2,Stop While You're Ahead,"I grew up on the first five books in the Archives of Anthropos, and really loved them. When I heard that this one had come out, I ordered it sight-unseen from my local bookstore and eagerly awaited its arrival. However, I didn't get very far into it before I realized that it was not what I had hoped for.Maybe it had something to do with being co-written, but this last book just didn't hang together. Conversations were stilted, and the characters kept feeling the need to remind each other about things they'd done in the past - obviously just to inform the reader who may not be familiar with the series. Very awkward. While it is good to hear from old friends, this story just wasn't good enough to merit its being written.Suffice it to say that you should only read this if your imagination won't satisfy you as to the future of Anthropos and the characters."
5,Great Performance,"This Blue Ray DVD is really terrific...The singing is all great, the acting, stage direction and orchestral playing are equally wonderful. The HD video and audio both add to to the enjoyment of this wonderful opera."
3,puritani,"Very well presented prodution of this opera.Female lead enchanting.Pavaotti,vocally magnificent but,artistically,not great.I have long regarded him as a wonderful tenor but,not one of the 'Greats',as,eg Bjorling.Bellini: I Puritani"
2,Ana Netrebko show,"Agree with Mrs. Silvia Costa about the bad choice of the male singers. I also think that there is a lack of talent and creativity in most of the MET productions including this one. The outdated painted scenaries are a real shame. Whereas European productions are experimenting these days with new concepts of opera staging (some of them quite good and some others quite unfortunate) Americans seem to be stuck into a rather rigid and old fashioned concept of staging. This is a clear example that money and excess does not necessarily buy good taste specially if they do not go hand to hand with new ideas. About the great diva: I certainly love Anna Netrebko, particularly her mad scene that is quite breathtaking. However I cannot take out of my mind the legendary performances of other great divas such as Maria Callas and Edita Gruberova in the same role. Anna Netrebko is spectacularly beautiful and elegant in the role though."
2,The old Stand and sing MET,"The telecast of Fille du regiment set a very high standard for opera in genral and for the Met specifically. They returned to their old ""star-driven"" stand and sing production for Netrebko. The chorus was static and uninvolved, the baritone was loud and unsubtle, the tenor was tall, handsome and VERY nasal and the young bass has started to sing out of the side of his mouth. There must have been dubious cuts and the only acting and movement were done by Netrebko. Hers is a beautiful instrument, but not really suited to this kind of music.I hope the Met keeps going in the new direction of energized and logical porductions. This was a true disappointment."
3,"Five stars for Anna Netrebko, but bad performances of the male voices.","Anna Netrebko gives us a wonderful performance in the role of Elvira. Nevertheless, I must disagree with most of the reviewers: just Miss Netrebko exists in this production, as the main male voices range from very bad (Arturo - Eric Cutler) to bad (Giorgio - John Relyea) and acceptable (Riccardo - Franco Vassalo).People not used to hear opera probably did not notice the weakness of the male voices, but I think that all opera's lovers are asking themselves ""Why did not the MET choose better ?""; ""Which criterium was used to select the male voices ?"".Unfortunately, what could have been a memorable production is just a very disappointing one.Nevertheless, Miss Netrebko's beautiful voice and acting make this an interesting DVD, which I rate with 3 stars, the mean of five stars for Anna Netrebko, Arturo*, Giorgio **, Riccardo ***, Chorus and Orchestra ****."
1,i puritani,"Bellini: I PuritaniCompré el DVD 4400 073 4421 I PURITANI y estoy totalmente decepcionado con esa compra, pues el sonido es una catástrofe.Paso a explicar lo refererente al estereo : La orquesta está en el foso como es lo normal, pero el sonido no sale del mismo y para colmo de males el coro la acompaña. El sonido es reverberante y no permite apreciar si los cantante son buenos o no. No es posible que esta grabación produzca una fatiga auditiva muy grande en pocos minutos. El sistema para estereo debe ser de lo mejor pues los amantes de esta clase de música así es como la disfrutan.Voy a conservar esta grabación para mostrarla a mis amigos para que no la compren, así como también las de esta serie del MET en alta definición. Este sonido es un retroceso para la DGG.Roberto Fonseca UgaldeCosta Rica"
1,Terrible performance ...,"Lots of cuts, few high notes, no trills, many vocal transpositions down to a safer tessitura ... And an horrible old production.Il you really want to hear this work, buy the Pavarotti/Sutherland CD but this DVD won't even give you an idea of what a beautiful work this can be with real belcanto specialists."
2,NOT classic acoustic music,"I bought this CD because I love the sound of the guitar- and the sound quality of this disk is great as expected for a Chesky recording. However, I just cannot enjoy music with the New Age / Avant Garde elements that Badi Assad adds to the tracks. Making popping sounds with her mouth, for example, ruins the music for me. If you are looking for CLASSIC or CLASSICAL guitar, this disk will disappoint you. There are a couple of tracks that are more traditional, but maybe not enough to justify buying the whole disk. On the other hand, if you appreciate avant garde innovations, then you might enjoy this CD more than I have."
1,Jane Turns in Her Grave,"I'm all for using the imagination to expand on what might have happened to Jane Austen's characters after her novels ended, but please, this one takes it beyond the limits. Can't Jane Austen's characters be copyrighted so that this can't happen again? Jane Austen's books are enjoyable because the characters are so well written and they have such class, something missing in the modern world. The author has turned them into characters from a ""bodice-buster"" novel. Darcy is now an 18th century Fabio and Elizabeth lusts like she is in a novel entitled, ""Love's Savage Destiny."" The author also substitutes good writing with outrageous plot twists like Elizabeth being kidnapped by a disgruntled footman, and Georgiana going off to the Napolianic wars to be a nurse! Thumbs down for me!"
1,Save your money,"I love Pride and Prejudice and like many fans, I just want to know more. That said, I still would not reccomend you buy it. First, the book uses over complicated language mixing ""period"" language with current words and phrase. It was awful. Then, the story line was both transpart and painful. It gives those of you who want to read it sex scenes, they it is not worth reading the rest of the book to get to them. Also, both Darcy and Elizabeth were not accurately pictured in the book. This book was a big disappointment. I feel like I wasted my money. I usually love this sequels to P&P even if they are not good literature, this one is not worth your time reading."
3,Liked it but needed to filter some things out,"Well, I have to agree with others here that this is not JA. However, I do think there are some elements of the story that are very much in line with how I think JA might have progressed her characters. It seems at times that the Author is a little preoccupied with it or maybe she thinks she needed it to keep the story going. In any case, it was a little over the top at times. I could have used a little more ""alluding to the fact"" rather than blow by blow details. Much more exciting. I also got a little bored towards the end, it dragged a bit. The Georgiana story line was the only one that I could not swallow, maybe the Bingley thing also. All in all, I really enjoyed it. If you can step back and filter some of the things out, it can be a vey fun read."
3,okay-she misspells Elizabeth's name!,"i'm trying to read this with an open mind, but everytime i see ""elisabeth"", i cringe. the author seems familiar with the work, but i don't understand how she (or the editor) could let such a glaring, obvious mistake be published. first rule of thumb-spell the names correctly please."
1,fraud,"As I started reading this book, I realized I already read it. In my collection of continuing books of Pride & Prejudice, I find this is the exact same book as Mr.Darcy Takes a Wife. How dare the author Linda Berdoll sell this book under another name??????? There should be a fine of thousands of dollars for her and the publishing company."
3,Enjoyable!,"Although Miss Austen certainly would not have embarked on explicitly describing the bedroom antics of Mr. and Mrs. Darcy, Ms. Berdoll did keep true to their characters as introduced in the original P&P. Elizabeth is spunky and Darcy, stoic. Their relationship as described in this book is full of love, passion, and respect.The book centers on the bond between Lizzy and Darcy through all the plot twists and turns. This fact alone makes the book enjoyable."
3,The Pride and Prejudice Obsession,"I've long been a Jane Austen fan and have obsessively read Pride and Predjudice a number of times, but I never knew anyone had had the presumption to write a sequel, until I visited this site. Exceedingly curious to read more about Elizabeth,whose abundant self esteem sets a great example for any young girl,and Darcy, whose restrained passion and honor are the perfect example of manhood, I dug in.The sex was incredibly hot --at first.After a while, I felt it bogged down the story. Jane Austen was the master of understatement. Linda Bertoll, sadly, has read a few too many Harlequin romances.I did love revisiting the Bennet family,though, and most characters seemed consistent, though Mr. Bennet did not get the witty zingers he deserved."
1,An insult to Jane Austen,"The book is pure trashy pornography; the so-called love scenes verge on or tumble into the ridiculous; the characters are all of them caricaturized and absolutely not corresponding to the originals; the facts told could never have happended to Jane Austen's characters, because they are neither so gross and superficial, nor so ignorant or ingenuous as the author makes them appear. The spelling is disastrous, the syntax nonexistent. Great books make the reader eager to know how the story goes on, but having read some sequels to Jane Austen's novels I'm of opinion that in most cases it is far better to check one's curiosity."
1,Don't waste your money on this,"This is a very silly book that is obsessed with sex. I seriously doubt that any of them would act this way--even Lydia is unbelievably crude. This book has taken characters from a beautiful, genteel world described in elegant prose by Jane Austen, and turned them into players in a trashy soft-porn novel. Don't waste your money!"
2,Not for the timid or innocent...,"The title should have been Sex Sinister like another reviewer has stated. This is your typical bodice ripper, sex depraved, trashy romance novel, which just happens to have characters named Darcy and Lizzie. The style is not even close to the period of Pride and Prejudice so therefore can not be considered a sequel to the book, but it could be the x-rated sequel to the mini-series maybe. Mr. Darcy must have been very rich indeed to afford two baths a day for each one of them, when during Jane Austen times more than one bath a month was considered an extravagance even for the wealthy. I found this book to be more like a very bad soap opera. While the mini-series took some creative license in good taste to make the story more compelling visually, this book does just the opposite. I was just very disappointed overall, since the characters are very compelling to begin with and to then put them into a bad soap opera without an originality or any glimmer of taste?"
1,Bad writing,"I agree with one other reviewer. After reading the good reviews, I decided I had to have this book. It is nothing but filth. It is way too long and is filled with.... Don't bother."
1,Austen Readers Beware,"Not only is the plot rambling, the grammar atrocious (every other sentence contains a phrase, like this, in parentheses), but the characters are utterly unbelievable. If you are looking for some amusing, if trashy, light summer reading, and you don't mind the desecration of some of literature's finest characters, read on. If, however, you are an Austen purist, save your time and money. This one is a disappointment from the word go."
4,Bawdy Fun Not for Purists,"This book will most appeal to whose who loved the recent miniseries. It bawdy and funny, and the story is quite good. Jane Austen purists BEWARE and take a hint -- DON'T READ IT! Let the rest of us have our fun."
1,"The Bar Sinister, Pride and Prejudice Continues",I love Jane Austen books and always wished there were more of them.After reading the positive reviews for this book I set out to find it.I had to order it and I was very eager to receive it.It was a HUGE dissapointment.It was a trashy book with nothing that would even remind me of Pride and Prejudice.I couldn't finish it.It was absolutely disgussting.I was going to give it to the library but I was ashamed to donate such trash.I just recycled it.I guess that you have to be an american to like it.
1,True lovers of PP... Give this book a miss!,"I've decided not to return this book only because it was a gift from a friend of mine. It might do if you're looking for a half-desent romance novel... however if you really love Pride and Prejudice, please don't waste your time and money on this book. It's so bad that you're going to hate Darcy and Lizzy by the end of it. (Enough said...)"
1,This is awful,This book insults your intelligence. Don't waste your time. I don't know why any reasonable publisher would think Jane Austen fans would appreciate this nonsense. It is basically soft-core porn disguised as a period novel trying to cash in on the success of Austen's P&P.I gave up after a few chapters because you couldn't get through a page without the author interrupting her story with another sexual encounter. It just doesn't fit the genre. Disappointing.
1,UGH,"Please do yourself a favor and skip this book. It's all been said-horrible cliches, non-existant editing, pure trash and it's all true. Don't confuse literature with garbage, which this is. Read Austen's original work, and use your own imagination to complete the story. Don't let this ""novel"" do it for you."
2,Bar Sinister,"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels. I love the characters, the plot, and the writing. In this book we have the same characters, the plot is okay, if a little too complicated, but the writing leaves me cold. What this book needs is a better editor."
4,My bonnet definately fell off....,"...and I don't think that after reading The Bar Sinister that I'll ever be able to tie it properly again(this deficiency will of course be due to my trembing hands!). Seriously, as a fellow sequelist, one of a totally different style, I have to confess to thoroughly enjoying Linda Berdoll's colourful account of the Darcys. Yes, this book has been accused of being blue but, due to the clever use of analogy it's really only turquoise. And in defence of the author, who many have said ought not to have used Austen's characters as the focal point for this ribald tale, I'd say that the whole point is that of looking from a different viewpoint. I think Linda Berdoll retains enough of the P&P characters' essence in her portrayal which only serves to make the incongruity of her observations all the more amusing. The thought of Mr Darcy in little more than a pair of full length riding boots is an enduring image!"
4,(Sometimes) Happily Ever After P&P,"Looks like I'm one of the few reviewers who adores the book version of P&P and also liked this book. Yes, there are a lot of typos; yes, there's a lot of sex. I didn't mind the former, and enjoyed the latter. :-)I also enjoyed the various twists and turns that the plot takes--unlike some other P&P continuations I've read, this is not just a Happily Ever After story, where there is wedded bliss for all and sundry. Some of the plot elements stretch credulity (Georgiana running off disguised as a man to serve as a wartime nurse?). Still, if you like angst mixed in with your romance, ""Bar Sinister"" is a page-turning read."
3,"Good story, but needs an editor","I really enjoyed the story Ms. Berdoll tells. I love all of the scenes between Elizabeth and Darcy, and how she fleshed out some of the minor characters in P&P (makes me wonder if a TV script was in the back of her mind...). But you have to be VERY forgiving as you read. I have never read a book with so many typos! I am not a literary critic, but I did feel some of the story itself could have used an editor's guiding hand and the five-dollar words used throughout were a bit much. If you are a Jane Austen purist, you may have a stroke reading this book, but if the A&E mini-series left you ""Darcy-manic"" this is a fun, racy sequel."
3,"Good book, but not a believable sequel","Though The Bar Sinister was a good book, and certainly had its share of excitement, I don't feel that Jane Austen would have appreciated the liberties taken with her characters. Many of the events in the novel reminded me of drug store romances. I won't go into particulars, for fear of ruining the story for other readers. There were few contradictions between P&P and The Bar Sinister, besides the changing of Mr. Collins's first name (William to Thaddeus) and making Elizabeth a horsewoman (in P&P she rode fairly ill). Several other reviewers mentioned Ms. Berdoll's lack of editing, to which I can attest. You would think that she would be able to spell the name of Mr. Darcy's ancestral home, where Elizabeth fell in love with him (Pemberley, incorrectly spelled as Pemberly throughout the entire book)."
4,Enjoyable and great fun,"Admittedly the editorial mistakes are distracting: names and words mispelled, punctuation left out, etc. Occasionally I found them just distracting enough to draw my attention away from the plot.Despite that, overall I was engaged from start to finish. Yes, it is more rique than Austen. Yes, it takes liberties. Yes, it has the tendency to read more like a romance novel. However, the characters are complelling and fleshed-out; the story is exciting; and most importantly, Elizabeth (or Elisabeth!) and Darcy have a fitting continuation to their love story. It didn't bother me at all that this wasn't Jane Austen I was reading. Darcy especially is fleshed out in a way that makes him a wonderful hero. It was nice to get a view into his perspective and a sense of the love he felt for his lady.Linda Berdoll obviously researched her material thoroughly. Now, if in her next novel she can take care of the glaring editorial mistakes, I'd say she'll have an even better book on her hands."
1,"Extremely Misleading , However . . . .","I would highly recommend that you preview the first 7 pages of this book first before ordering online. This book is not for everyone and certainly would be frowned upon by Austen purists. If, however, you enjoy reading classical and modern romance novels (ex. works from Danielle Steel), then this would definately be a good read."
3,"Enjoyable, but somewhat lacking","This book, over all, gave the impression of being written by a 15 year old. A talented, fledgling, writer, but someone who has not yet mastered the craft. The narrative was a times very childish. Also, while the writer made an attempt at using classic language, failed utterly. Words were used incorrectly and far too often. In an attempt to sound like Jane Austen, this author instead gave an air of a poor actor.This being said, I enjoyed the book, on its own merits. I found the situations interesting and engaging and the characters heart warming and passionate. While at times the whole thing became, perhaps, a little too unbelievable, it was still a very enjoyable read.Overall, if you like authors such as Debbie Macomber you will most likely enjoy this book. It is a fun and easy read and, thus far, the best Pride and Prejudice sequel I have read."
2,Maybe a change of cover.,"I think it would have been better if the publishers had put a much different cover on this book. A Fabio-esque Mr Darcy with a scantily clad Elizabeth would have been much more enlightening as to the contents for the first half of the book. Though it does eventually settle down and have a plot, it seems to be singularly lacking in the wit and vivacity demonstrated by Miss Austen in the original. I bought the book because I wanted to see what happened to these people with whom I had become so well acquainted...or at least thought I had. It is an entertaining book, in it's own way, but if it were the first book I had read about these folks, I would not feel any desire to read another.If you are a fan of romance novels as they seem to exist today, with a high sexual content, then you would probably like this book, too."
3,Mostly delightful,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. The first half is true to Austen's original characters, with bawdiness and humor to boot. Unfortunately, the second half kind of drags. But well worth a read for obsessed P&P fans like me."
4,Happy but at the same time sad!,this book is pretty good because it takes you right after Lizzy and Darcy's wedding and it also tells you how much Lizzy wants a child. i didnt like how they wrote about Jane and Mr. Bingly because the author wrote that he made a big mistake with someone rusulting in hurting Jane. but all in all it was pretty good because i finished it in 2 days.
2,mis marketing,"The book is a great read, but I am upset, nay angry that Amazon nowhere made clear that it is exactly the same book as ""Mr. Darcy takes a wife"" Instead it is marketed by Amazon as: people who bought ""Bar Sinister"" also bought ""Mr. Darcy took a wife"".I have bought loads at Amazone and am frankly miffed at the,"
4,It's pretty good except it's not the best,this book was pretty good because it showed that Darcy and Lizzy really loved each other in my oppion. I hated Bingly because he didnt care about Jane. I also hated that the author mispelled Elizabeth's name. But all in all it was pretty intersting cause i finished reading the book in 2 days.
5,Pleasant surprise,"I was leary when I bought this book- serials tend to be poorly written affairs, especially when done by a different author. I was pleasantly surprised. True, Jane Austin didn't write this book, but nonetheless, this book is an excellent read."
4,speedy!,"good price, great condition sent it out straight away and recieved it 2days before the estimated delivery!"
5,Mind Sifter..,"This is classic Trek.I remember reading this sooo long ago when it first came out.I cannot heap enough praise for this book!Others have mentioned 'Mind Sifter'..possibly the most powerful Star Trek story since 'City on the edge of forever'I never forgot it and it did the unthinkable...it brought me to tears.Other Trek books to get along with this one, are 'The fate of the Phoenix' and 'The price of the Phoenix',strong stories."
4,Skeet Ulrich--a magnetic actor,"I was mesmerized by Skeet's performance as the quiet, gentle farmer whose love for his bride is truly unconditional. His body language conveys the most subtle of emotions without the necessity of speech. This was a difficult role, which, it turned out, was perfectly suited to Skeet's talents as an understated, intense actor."
4,Very Good for the Price,"I had a very bad back pain that I decided to buy one og these back support stuff. It's helping a lot! However, the only imporovement that it needs is that it needs to be a little longer to cover more back area. Other than that it's helping amazingly."
3,Back support,"The back support helps, but I expected a more rigid appuratus. I ordered this thinking that it would have flat metal rods."
2,Too Scratchy,"It needed to have a soft fabric padded lining. as all my others have ,Lumiscope Criss Cross White Back Support, Mediumin front. It scratces the heck out of my stomach. Can't wear it for very long as it tends to pinch after a while."
2,Not supportive enough,"This belt is surprisingly unsupportive. The elastic is the strength of the elastic in the waistband of pants. It is not strong enough to support the lower back. I'm disappointed that I wasted the time to get this all the way to my house, and then had to go back on Amazon to find something that would actually work. My back went without proper support for more than a week because this failed to help."
4,Great Support,My wife works at a kindergarten place and uses it all the time. One of her coworkers ended up getting the same after they saw her wearing it.
1,unusable,"all the tables in this kindle version of the book are absolutely unusable. You cannot see any numbers because of a completely crappy resolution and compression used. And if you zoom in you can see them even less. I don't know how amazon can say that this book is optimized for ""large screens"" if I equally can't see any numbers on my 20"" monitor or 3.5"" phone screen."
5,Where it all started.....,"This is it. The ""Holy Grail"" of western Swing...it all starts here...can't get any better. The quality of the CD is outstanding. If that is not enough, man, read the booklet written by Gary Ginell. 20 pages of pure pleasure information and find out everything about ""pappy"" and the band and why Bob Wills was fired in the first place....can't give you more information. You have to read it yourself! Buy it!"
1,Not a good purchase,The batteries fit so loosely that i had to rig it with paper inside the battery chamber to get the connections to touch. After that the knob broke and it hit the trash.
2,"bad graphics, good gameplay","The game has a more realistic feel, but the graphics (are not as good as) the other ps2 games available. If your going to spend ($) on a hockey game for PS2, then wait, don't buy this (...)"
1,horrible,"I love hockey and have owned every EA hockey game available all with satisfaction. Yes this game is more like real life than others, but if i wanted real life i would strap on my pads and go play. The players are slow and hard to move, and the button combo's are difficult to learn. I thought ESPN of all people could do better."
1,This game is very bad,"This game is not good. I agree with the earlier reviews which say that when they first started playing they thought this was one of the worst games they played. Unfortunately for me, I didn't think that game was any better after I played it a while. I really wish that it was...This game is not fun to play, the camera angles are bad and the graphics are worse. The gameplay is also very poor. The players are very difficult to control.The best thing about this game is the opening intro which looks and sounds like ESPN's TV Broadcast. Everything after the game begins is downhill.Buy something else!!!"
2,SKIP IT,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS. THE ONLY HOCKEY GAME THAT EXIST FOR ME IS EA NHL 2001. IT HAS EVERYTHING THAT ESPN DOES NOT HAVE,GRAPHICS,CONTROLS,GREAT GAME PLAY.IF YOU EVER PLAYED EA'S NHL 2001 THEN YOU HAVE PLAYED THE BEST.ESPN'S IS THE WORST.DON'T BOTHER WITH IT."
2,poor and misleading information,"The best of these sessions is the live version of Milestones, but who plays tenor sax on this subject is George Coleman and was performed in the concert of Miles Davis Quintet in Antibes, July 27, 1963, which can be heard CD ""In Europe"" by Miles Davis."
3,Good live performances - shame about the sound quality,"The music on these live recordings is generally good, but the recording quality mainly isn't; it's just about acceptable.The tracks are:1. Bye bye blackbird 6.482. Four 4.493. It never entered my mind 3.484. Walkin 6.285. Milestones 9.236. So what 8.50The line-up is listed asMiles on trumpetTrane on saxBill Evans on piano*Paul Chambers on bassPhilly Joe Jones on drums** Wynton Kelly and Jimmy Cobb play on ""So What"" in place of Evans and Jones.There is no indication on the sleeve notes where or exactly when these recordings were made, except in ""New York"" sometime between 1958 and 1960 - the legendary ""Kind of Blue"" period. Thanks for the detail, fellas. It does have a raw, jazz-club feel and some of the performances on these Davis standards from the period do shine, particularly ""Bye bye blackbird"" and ""So what."" It's a shame about the sound, which does not ruin but does diminish these recordings as a listening experience. 3.5 stars."
1,Disappointment,"I have been looking for the Dr. seuss video's in a dvd format for a long time, so I was very excited when I saw them advertised on Amazon.com. I was very disappointed to find that they were not the videos I remember watching on television as a child. I ordered The Cat in the hat, Green eggs and ham and ABC. I was not happy with any of them. I also ordered How the Grinch Stole Christmas, which is the video and not an animated book."
1,shameful,"If you've ever enjoyed the original Seuss classics on TV you will be disappointed with these. I made the mistake of not reading the reviews and only looked at amazons' star rating they put beside the product pic. It's supposed to represent the reviewer's ratings but when I read these ratings(after the fact), there was only one positive from some ol' gramps... Of course the return policy dosen't allow me to return after the precious plastic wrap had been removed! ...."
1,how can animation be STILL?,I wish I had seen the reviews on Amazon before buying this video. There is nothing moving in this video - it is essentially voiceovers over filming of a book shaking up and down. Not worth the DVD it was burned on. A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!
1,Sham - Avoid,"Love the book, an all-time favorite ... but this video is a... As those who actually watched the video said in their reviews, this is animation of the lowest variety. You see static pictures with narration and some very weak sliding movement of pictures across a background. Additionally, the other stories on the tape aren't even illustrated in Seuss-style but by some other illustrator. My 3-yr old doesn't think much of this tape. Vastly disappointing and a shameful...of one the classics ... buy the book instead."
3,"Too short, but sweet","We received this DVD as an Xmas gift. My two and eight month old son loves the ""Green Eggs and Ham"" segment and demands that it be repeated over and over. Only problem I have with the disc is that the whole thing totals maybe 30 minutes and costs about the same as a full-length DVD. Check this out of the library or buy it used, because it's not worth the price. Sony could have fit more than three 10-minute episodes on this disc, no problem."
2,This is NOT a Cartoon!,"First let me say that my kids have warmed up to this video and now watch it. It seems to be a good bedtime video. But it is not an animated cartoon the way you expect. It is more like pictures with people reading the story. Some kids might like that, but it took mine awhile to get into it."
3,I forgot how old this was!,"I love Dr. Seuss but I simply forgot how old ""green eggs and ham"" really is!Overall, I think my 3 y/o enjoyed it, but at times I could see where he'd drift-off some and I'm assuming it was because of the graphics; which just didn't capture and retain his attention.I first saw this when I was 9 or 10 and back then, the message and graphics were marginal but, that was all we had in terms of technology. I guess all I'm saying is that the time for a redo is now!I would still recommend this movie!"
1,Awful! This is NOT THE CARTOON YOU REMEMBER!,I bought this thinking it was the fully animated cartoon I remember seeing when I was a kid in the 70's. It is NOT the same thing. This is like some really cheesy partially animated reading of the book. Very disappointed in this title.
3,try it try it i say try it and like it you may i say,"well,i heard that the movie jokers in hollywood are working their hairbrains smoky trying to squeeze 1 and a half hours of green eggs and ham out onto the big screen.the story is this.theres this guy.............wait!more of a whommmmmmmmmmmmmm.........no hes a dr suess character who wont eat green eggs and ham.this obnoxious little !@#$%^& follows him around and badgers him until he tries it.each time the guy asks sam to try someway or someplace new.the kids love the book and kind of like the movie.the redundancy is a bit nerve racking for parents but they could always watch it while you do the dishes or cook right?it is perfectly consistent with the book in every way.the message i guess is dont knock it until youve tried it.this is good advice most of the time but could also get you into big trouble."
2,ULI Guide,"For its high price, you may want to seriously think about your needs. If your intention is to buy a book for a broad overview of the development process with a somewhat academic approach, then this may be right for you. If you are builder or someone with prior real estate brokerage/service experience, you may find this too ivory tower and not practical. This book was a bit theoretical for my taste.Although this book has been reprinted recently, all the data dates back to the late-1990's. Social and economic data are perhaps presented for illustrative purposes only, however, it is a bit disheartening.There are some interesting project data, financial models and checklists, but frankly, the reader could figure those out on his/her own with some common sense and marginal experience in the industry.Bottom line -- my suggestion is to review the book at the public library before you buy."
2,Not worth the $$ and didn't even work right.,"Santa brought this for our 2 boys for Christmas this year. There are 5 games, and only 2 worked correctly. We had to take the basketball player apart and get it to work, and the soccer flippers for the soccer game only had one side working. We took this apart and fixed it too. The pool game and hockey games is fun, and worked properly. It was not worth the money, should have just invested more money and got a bigger and better one. I do not recommend this produce to anyone. Please don't waste your money."
2,Not what it appears to be.,"Cheaply made product. Not worth the money or the shipping. Item was defective when opened and child was disappointed. The flipper on the side did not work, and the basketball player arms did not move. Very disappointed."
1,dissatified customer,Bought the large 3-1 Game thinking this would be GREAT to put on top of it for my 5 yr. old Grandson play with. My daughter said it was cheap & NOT worth what was paid for it. She is sending it back for pieces are way too small & hard to play with & again NOT worth the money. Cheaply made & don't spend your money on this item! This year I think allot of the toys you see on TV are cheaply made but at a high price knowing WE ALL will pay for what our kids want. We have sent allot of things back that are NOT worth the money.
3,Better Than Average Baseball Concepts!,"An above average baseball DVD that might warrant four stars but I thinkthree and a half are good enough. The situations that are shown reallypresent game like issues. But as much as you run through this stuff in practice,the games present an entirely different forum for the kids. With that said,I can still recommend this as worthwhile for coaches involved in youth level play."
1,Performance I don't trust,"I bought this all in on cable so that I could battle my friend on his gamecube on pokemon XD. However, when the connection screen showed up it said to save your pokemon game at a pokemon center. I saved it at the center, and connected at the same moment that this cable was detectimg the connection it automatically stopped the connection and said i didn't save properly, AND ON TOP OF THAT IT DELETED MY WHOLE POKEMON SAVED FILE, and now i have to start all over. Bah! I wouldn't buy this cable, maybe you should get a brand name one."
3,"Book is over-rated, over-priced",I used this book for the USLME Step 3 and found that it was not as helpful as the other reviewers stated. It is definitely over priced.
5,Our Pass Rates Took Off,"Our pass rate averaged 77% on the Medicine Boards prior to switching to Nail the Boards for our third year residents. Since making it as required reading for our residents, no one's failed yet. Usually we'll do a chapter or 2 each week. This review is very well-organized, had everything we were looking for, and did the job. It was like winning the lottery as far as our program's pass rates were concerned. A great find and a solid review!"
2,Dr. TMS,"Not worth the high price. Difficult to clean and very persnickety. Comes with a bunch of sensors that, if not properly triggered, keep it from roasting. Not long after I bought it, I couldn't get it to start without jamming a pencil in one spot, and now it doesn't work at all. When it works, it works fine, but it doesn't always work nor does it last very long."
3,Fair Roaster,"It works, but you have to use your own timer and get used to what length of time it takes for each type of bean to roast. Using the directions has resulted for me in burnt beans over and over. This is my second. Had to send the first one back for repairs. Not sure who gave it 5 stars, but roasting coffee does not smell good; it tastes awesome however, but the smell? Don't think so.I guess it is worth the money and I'm now very used to it so I'm familiar with all the quirks. I'd buy one again cause I know this one and would be afraid to put and other $300 plus on something new to me."
5,I love this show!!!!!!!!,"Really i give this show way over 5 stars. I love this show soo much and it really sucks that they won't put it on DVD. They really need to, because so many people love this show. I heard somewhere that if summerland doesn't get enough ratings this summer, then they are going to cancel the show, and i cried. So everyone make sure you watch it this summer so we can save our show! Maybe if we get enough ratings, they'll put it on DVD!!!!!!!! Save our Show!!!!!!!!!"
5,Summerland,"Even though I am new to watching the show, I have automatically fallen in love with it. The plot gets more interesting every day. The characters' personalities change, romance begins, and you'll never want to miss an episode. I know I don't. Every Monday through Friday at eight, seven central, I am watching The N, waiting for the days drama to begin. This DVD will make it possible for people to watch this show unscheduled and get pulled deeply into this wonderful story. It really would be wonderful. Please, WB, bring it to DVD (Or back on... That'd be even better. lol)."
5,Summerland DVD,"I would absolutely love if a box-set of Summerland came out. I've seen every episode...some even twice, and it never gets boring. It's a great family show, and I don't know a girl who wouldn't love to watch Jesse McCartney or Zac Efron!"
4,Natural products Work!,"This is a great product for the skin. My friend had a bad rash/infection of some kind and after treating with chemicals and meds, she used this and really liked it."
5,Calendula is powerful,"I had a scar on the head of my penis. I tried many things and the scar would not heal. I read somewhere that calendula heals scars if applied directly. So, I decided to try the Calendula Extract from Herb Farm. The first time I tried the product it burned. The burning was less every time I applied the product in the morning and evening. In less than a week, a miracle happened, the scar was closed and now it's hard to find where the scar was; the scar is fading away."
4,Great Self-Hypnosis CD!!,"I've had this CD for about 5 years and I can't believe I waited so long to review it. Every time I listen to it I am left feeling peaceful and relaxed. Melissa's voice is very soothing and I the background music is beautiful. I notice a difference in my attitude toward life when I include listening to this CD as a regular part of my weekly routine. To be honest, I didn't expect that at all!!! I took one star off because I think the session should have developed more slowly and lasted longer. I highly recommend this CD!!"
3,"not the best, but not too bad","I've tried other recordings before as well as live hypnotheapists and there are better options other than this CD. I'm finding it to be a bit on the long winded side and her vocal delivery is sometimes jumbled. I've tried listening to it at night while I went to sleep and find that I need a good bit of volume in order to understand all of her words, but that makes it too loud at times.I also didn't think that some of the visualizations were very good. The imagining playing with a puppy and it's little ""puppy breath"" seemed a bit odd. Then the part about regressing to when you were 5 years old...I just didn't see a use for it. I will continue to try this and be open minded about it, but I don't think that it is the best choice for a hypnosis CD."
3,Not Relaxing,"I felt also the script was regimented and too fast. The counting was annoying, as well as the clicking or snapping of fingers, not soothing at all, I found that to be extremely annoying. Images also didn't gel with me, too dictated."
1,Overcouming Obstacles,"Don't WASTE your Money on this!!!! She tries to hypno you way way tooo fast. From the start of the CD to the time that she tries to put you under is less then two minutes. The day that I got the CD I had been up for almost 16 hours and only gotten 3 hours of sleep the night before. Even being that tired, I was not able to get hypno in less then two minutes. I even listen to the CD three more times that night and still could not go under.The other thing is she does not have a calm and soothing voice. It is ruff and crackly.Denmeister"
4,Pretty good!,"It's a pretty good CD, I've had some worse, Bob Griswold, and some better, Glenn Harrold, but this CD was pretty good. You do take something away, it does relax you, it does help you sleep, and I truly enjoy listening to it every time I play it. It is one of my favorite self-hypnosis CD's, just be aware that her voice is a little odd, not that great of a choice for a CD, but you get use to it."
4,not bad at all,i found this video very easy to follow. I am unsure of all the negative reviews. I have practiced yoga on and off for 3+ years. The relaxation part is somewhat lengthy and i wish both episodes were combined into one. I would recommend this video to all beginners.
1,Unsafe yoga,"I hope there is something wrong with this vod. Specifically, Sybel starts the practice with poses that most often are used as part of a cool down process: bridge pose, plow, and pigeon, to name a few.As the other 1 star reviews have said, Sybel's practice is disjointed and confusing, with very little prep or breathing leading into or during each pose. When I go to a yoga class the instructor typically spends 2 minutes in pigeon. Sybel spent at most 20 seconds.She unsafely moved in and out of poses without instruction on breathing or any amount of set-up. A beginner could definitely injure themselves easily.But honestly, I suggest avoiding this altogether, regardless of your level or ability."
2,Printer compatability problems,"My wife is a pre-school teacher. With our latest upgrade of windows XP, the driver needed for this software to print was removed. I have yet to learn how to restore that driver. Users of Windows XP beware!"
1,Disney Print Studio Collection,I was looking so forward to having this print collection because none of the older Disney print sets (of which I had all of them) work on newer versions of Windows. Sadly this one was the same thing. I didn't realize it and it only worked on Windows versions up to Millenium. I have Vista and it won't install. I wish Disney would stop doing that.
1,Lopez And Mexican Music,This CD reminds of music I heard when I was a child growing up in Mexico. It is nice but not original. I have a lot of CDs that I bought before this CD came out that sound the same.I like most of Narada products but not this one.
5,Great!!!,"Oscar Lopes is rated as being the fastest guitar player alive today and it shows, specially during the last two tracks. Overall, this cd offers a great variety of pieces, unlike many others which sound too similar to be distinguished after a while. Muchas gracias, Oscar."
1,disappointed,"I bought this to replace and repair a bad fuel level sending unit. Once replaced it did not correct the problem. According to the dealer, they sometimes have to replace 3 or 4 before they get one that works. For the normal person that is not possible since you can't return the part once its installed, and who has the money to keep buying the part in hopes of getting one that works. Disappointed."
3,not weird enough,"i bought this cause it is soft porn, a double feature, and had plenty of extras. unfortunately...the soft porn is really soft, very little of it is actually erotic or sexy. both films fail to capitalize on these aspects because of their inherent campiness.i actually preferred Cleo over R&J;, but not by much. neither are very good but at least Cleo had a little more sensuality, more ""love"" scenes, while R&J; was almost a comedy(an unfunny one at that)the extras are ok, but unless you're a die hard fan or an extreme collector, you'll probably access them just once.overall, if you're looking for high eroticism or classic porn, look elsewhere. if you're just looking for something different, then this just might be weird enough to hold your interest. personally, i found it to be too run of the mill to be anything special."
4,Perfect condition!,My niece's 3rd birthday is this weekend and I bought the book set for her... She loves the cartoon so I was excited to find this.. It arrived far ahead of time and it was in great condition! PERFECT THANKS!!
3,nice for the pooly sorts of things,but you will definitely gets what you pays for with this stuff and going anywhere near something bigger than a paddling pond with these outside of chemically treated water is probably a really bad idea. slightly better than feet with equipment perhaps - but only slightly :)
3,A little bit uncomfortable!,They do the job but are a little bit unconfortable. Too hard on my feet and they are not flexible enough to get to speed. I gave it 3 stars because they do the job and look nice but they could be a little bit more comfortable.
1,US Divers Proflex II Diving fins,I used these once while swimming in salt water and they split on me. I would never recommend them. I had a cheap pair of Nemrods that I have had for 20 years and they lasted!
1,These are toys,"The first pair broke immediately, the replacement pair's boot ripped after about 9 pool sessions. Save your money, get real fins, not the kind you find at big box stores.Suggest Atomic, Cressi, Oceanic, Scubapro, Head (workout), etc."
5,Very well designed,"Over the past few years, I have developed a real love of lake swimming. We have a lake nearby that is always clean and pleasant, and on which no motorized boats are allowed. So nothing can run into you, the water isn't gross, and, being that I live in Wisconsin, there is nothing in the lake that views me as food. Pretty nice. I really enjoy swimming across and back (roughly 1 mile), but noticed that, without flippers, I feel just a little less safe out there (and I move much more slowly, too). These flippers are really well-designed. I like their look and feel on my feet, and I move more efficiently than I did with my previous pair (of a cheaper brand). Great fins, and I have every confidence they will last me a long time."
