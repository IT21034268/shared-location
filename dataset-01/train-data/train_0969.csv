2,Stay away from this book!! Its a waste of paper...,"This book is not for beginners, and contrary to the reputation of O'Reilly press, this is not for experts.The book uses a simple way to discribe many cases of things going bad. But it stays on the superficial layer of the problems.The paradigm it uses is describe the problem, ways to prevent it, and how to get off the hook. This may seem very tempting to read because of the easy way to analyse the content of the cases. I like the 3 step aproach, but I didn't see and substance of the way she explained and the conjectures of details each process entails.The book in general is a simpleton... and its boring."
5,Good Book for Newbies & experienced people - who *think* they know it all,I've been on Ebay since 1998 and although I don't think I know it all - I found out how little I did know. Shawna's real life stories and experiences show you how to avoid situations you had never even thought about. I used to only think UPS was the only way to go - now I appreciate how it isn't necessarily as good as I thought - and can actually be an inconvience... If you are new to Ebay - this is an excellent resource! Highly recommended!
5,A MUST READ...FOR ALL EBAY USERS,"This insightful, intelligent and extremely humorous book is for all ebay users. I am no newbie to eBay but goodness me the section on shipping alone is worth it's weight in gold. But I must tell you all that this book is VERY FUNNY. It's out-loud funny. The last time I laughed out load reading a book was when I read Auntie Mame. If you like to laugh or smile then this book is for you. I highly recommend it (even if you don't use ebay)."
5,BRAVA!!!!,"I think that this film is perhaps the most poinent and outstanding work that I have ever seen Sigourney Weaver do....Her co-star Ben Kingsely is brilliant as well and there was not a moment I was not at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next in this very intense mystery/thriller. In total, there were only 3 actors in this film which all take palce in a small home. I imagine that this might have been a stage play at some time and you would HAVE to have very goood performances for this to work! Not that the storyline is dull in ANY way-a VERY well told story, indeed! If you like powerful and dramatic performances in a WELL told story with mystery,thriller and suspence-this film is for YOU! What a gem of a movie-you shan't be disappointed!"
3,Good drama,"Death and the Maiden is overall a very good drama. Roman Polanski creates another ""Repulsion"", this time with two additional characters. Based on a play and doesn't attempt to hide it's stage origins, the film flows remarkably well and doesn't get long winded.It relies heavily on good performances and Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley are more than up to the task. Weaver is particularly effective as the film plays on viewer's emotions and for a good period of time, one doesn't know at all who's to blame and who deserves pity.There's not much in the way of directorial touches that scream out POLANSKI, but as in ""Repulsion"", he milks the isolated setting for all it's worth."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though Weaver is often outacted by her two costars, this adaptation of Dorfman's play is so consistently interesting and thought-provoking that it more than makes up for Sigourney's occasional lapses; with a clever structure, interesting background, and great monologue by Kingsley at the end, it's an underrated treasure."
3,Not as good as many claim,"If you have read the play by Ariel Dorfman, I think you will find this movie adpatation to be wanting. Though there are fine performances by Weaver and Kingsley, Polanski connects too many of the dots for the viewer, leaving little doubt as to the credibility (or madness) of the main characters. It was this very ambiguity that made the play so enjoyable, but this is not evident in the DVD."
4,Sophisticated Graphics Replicate Gameboards Faithfully But Adults Will Want to Skip the FIrst Two Games,"Young children should enjoy these faithful electronic versions of their childhood board games, but be aware that the small Game Boy screen can show only a portion of the board, which scrolls and changes with each player's turn.As an adult, for me the one attraction of the package was Memory, the ""Concentration""-like game in which a player tries to find pairs among face-down cards as quickly as possible. A bonus here is the choice of the number of cards in the layout, with the largest of the three layouts, 72 cards, being quite challenging."
3,A nice intro game for little ones to learn on,"For our trip back east, I wanted to get my kid a Game Boy Advance to keep her busy during the flight. Since this would be her first video game, I wanted a game that would be teach her how to use the controls. This game helped her with that."
4,fun,I bought this for my duaghter for Christmas. Yes she has a Game Boy because I refuse to let a 5 year old have a new electronic. So she uses her sisters old Gam Boy. It is a cute game and she enjoys it very much.
3,Fun for young children,"I bought this game for my 5 year old son and he seems to enjoy it. My only complaint is that the screen is hard to see the figures, and when we play it on the game boy player on the tv, the image quality is very grainy, but overall it is a good game. Better played with more than one person though. His favorites are candy land and memory, I dont think he ever plays chutes and ladders."
3,Cute game,"This is a cute game that brings back childhood memories of playing the board games. Exactly the same. Very simple and basic, but still fun."
5,Here's the story,Of all America's exports The Brady Bunch has to be one of its most enduring. This is an excellent gift for a true fan of the show. It even includes Alice's much vaunted meatloaf recipe.
3,This is a decent cd!!,"I first herd of this band from a friend and once i listened to Ra's first single ""do you call my name"" i had to get there cd!!! The lead singer in ""do you call my name"" frightenly sounds like a young ozzy osbourne. The rest of the though is somewhat repetivtive. But for the price its being sold for you couldnt find a better cd, so i highly recomend this cd!!!"
4,Finally something other than hiphopmetal,"I picked up this cd for $9.99 and it's worth twice that. The single that's on the radio, ""Do You Call My Name"" is very good, but there's better on the cd. Very catchy lyrics, chorus', guitar work and rhythms. A must for anyone who loves metal/hard rock and is sick of ""Hip Slop""."
5,From One Review,"This is most likely one of the best CD's I have listened too. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes variety compacted into 12 songs.1. Do You Call My Name (10/10)- You may of heard this on the radio, it is probably Ra's most popular song.2. Rectifier (9/10)- Good song, good beat.3. Fallen Rock Zone (9/10)- I like the lyrics and the intro to this song.4. Only (10/10)- This is one of my favorite songs on the album. One of the best songs I've heard.5. On My Side (8/10)- Good song, but not one of my favorites.6. Violator (10/10)- Another one of my favorites, good beat and intro.7. I Believe (8/10)- Good lyrics, but not one of my favorites.8. Parole (8/10)- Good beat, but not one of my favorites.9. High Sensitivity (10/10)- Another favorite.10. Skorn (9/10)- Weird intro, but overall a good song.11. Walking and Thinking (9/10)- A softer song, but still a good one.12. Sky (10/10)- Good finishing song, another favorite.Overall the CD gets a (9.8/10). ITS A GOOD ONE."
5,RA kicks ass,"RA is one of my favorite bands, and finally seeing them hit the big time ROCKS! They are up there and are at the top of the list with any other rap/metal bands. With melodic sounds and kick ass riffs, make this a must have album for any fan of music. They can write awesome lyrics, and put down music to them that just makes them stand out of the crowd.GET IT!!"
4,If only,"I'll start off by saying that this album is very good. The thing that is most impressive about the album is the songwriting. It seems as though you've heard these songs many times before, however, they still sound fresh. It sounds familiar, yet new. Just a very refreshing rock album. It's nothing ground-breaking, however, if your like me you are quite sick of bad music being released recently. Ra could be a very popular mainstream radio band, actually its probably the only chance they have of sticking around. They aren't the type of band that would attract any sort of cult following. However, with this album they SHOULD get significant air play with ""Do You Call My Name"", ""On My Side"", ""Sky"", ""Skorn"". All in all its just a very fresh catchy album that has good hooks decent production and should put Ra on the map."
5,:),"i really like this cd. all the songs are unique, none really sound the same. do you call my name and rectifier are awesome songs! some of the songs might take a while to understand, but once you grasp the lyrics you will love the songs."
4,What a Great Album,This is what you would call an underdog album because it never really did make it big or anything like that and i yet have to buy it but i have heard alot of the songs on this album and they are just good i think this is the best Nu-Metal band out there right now its alot better than Linkin Park alot better anyways want something good to listen 2 get this and the opening track Do You Call My Name is just awesome
5,Awesome Debut from a promising band,"Ra - From One...its actually a funny story how i came across this CD. i was in my CD store thinking of something to buy and in the store they have those scanners where u get to preview the cd before u buy it. i picked the Ra cd because i thought the cover art was kool and the name of the band was peculiar. when i scanned it....i was blown away by the opening track, ""Do You Call My Name"". i bought the cd and listened to it on the way home. this has to be one of the best debuts to come out in a while. probably since Disturbed's 'sickness' debut. all the track are great. the lead singer voice is amazing. he has the vocal range of MJK from Tool. the guitar and bass riffs range from korn to tool. and the drumming is supreb. i love all the tracks on the CD but the standout track for me has to ""i Believe"". if u like bands like Tool, Korn, Chevelle, Dream Theater and Trust Co. ull love this CD. TRUST ME."
2,Two and a Half out of Five Stars,"Excellent- 1 Do you Call My NameGood- 3 Rectifier, Parole, SkyAverage- 4 Only, Fallen Rock Zone, On My Side, ViolatorBelow Average- 4 High Sensitivity, Skorn, I Believe, Walking and ThinkingTerrible- 0There are Catchy parts in Fallen Rock Zone but at the very end of the song the ter sounds off. Violator has a Good Chance of Being Excellent song around 33 seconds but sorda dies along with the song. It sounds like the whole CD is based around one song on the CD that was an average song and I think that was the I Believe song...Around the 7th song I start to really get annoyed by the Ra Singers voice, but Parole is a very good song. The Songs all sound somewhat the same but all CDs do that, so I guess it is sorda how they all sound the same, this one didn't do a good job of that though because of the Singers Voice. You may think different though, but Im pretty certain of it, that this isnt that good of a CD. Its a 2 1/2 out of 5 stars"
5,One of the best new rock bands...,"Ra has got to be one of the best new rock bands. For their first album, it's extrmely good, without a bad song on it. The Cd is well worth the money. If you like Ra, I suggest that you check out Seether, or Breaking Benjamin, some other great bands. rock on..."
4,Great Sound.,"I was a little aprehensive when buying this CD, as I wasn't sure if the rest of the CD could live up to the energy and power I felt with ""Do You Call My Name"" but I was surprised it did with other great songs like ""Falling Rock Zone"" and ""Sky""."
2,Not one of my favorite BSC books,"I'm a huge fan of The Baby-Sitter's Club books. However, this is one of my least favorites in the series. There are so many characters in the book, it's hard to remember who's on and what their purpose is in the book."
2,more emasculation of Asian-American men,"This film is important and needed for three reasons. One, you get to see supa-fine Russell Wong. Two, rarely do you see a movie with so many Asian-American men. Three, this movie illustrates that Asians did live in the US before 1965's liberalization of immigration laws. Still, in this movie, when Russell is a gigolo for a white female client, he's sexually active. However, when he has a cute Chinese wife, he's impotent. This seems like some disturbing white-worshipping to me. It's kinda anti-Asian woman too. Haven't we seen and heard enough of historical stereotypes of Asian men as not true masculines?! Then, the end is too fast and illogical. This movie had so much potential that it did not meet."
3,Old Chinese men gossiping.,"Ben Loy is one of the first Chinese men in New York to marry and bring his bride back to America. The old men, most of whom have their wives in China, are thrilled. They see Ben's marriage as a new beginning for their aging hamlet. But the weight of everyone's hopes on his shoulders renders Ben impotent. His lonely wife has an affair and soon concieves a child. The resolution is funny, but the acting is occasionally lackluster. Still, it is worth the trip."
2,Poorly Played,"I had to watch this movie for a class, and I was sorely disappointed. You don't need to have read the book to see how abridged the movie is, condensing long periods of time into a few unconvincing seconds. This isn't helped by the fact that Russell Wong has the emotional range of Keanu Reeves. There were only two scenes in the film that I thought came together in every respect - both starring Victor Wong - but the fact that they were such good moments only made the poor quality of the rest of the film that much more apparent.I felt the script was bland and unoriginal, and the actors seemed to lack any real personality on the screen because of this. It seemed exactly like a dozen other American movies, only this one starred Chinese actors. None of the decisions within the movie seem believable, and the ending feels tacky and schmaltzy and all those other things I can't stand in a movie.It's definitely not the worst movie, but I had much higher expectations from it."
2,Not A Good Reference,"For a book with ""Reference"" in the title, this book is very poor at providing me with any information I look for in it. Virtually every time I try to find some topic in the book, it isn't there. If I do find what I need in it, the wording and description is so poor that I don't get much out of it. This book is worth having in your library if you are an Oracle DBA, but ""Expert Oracle9i Database Administration"" by Sam R. Alapati is far and away superior, both in content and in writing style. If you are looking for an Oracle9i book, start with Alapati's book first."
3,Not very thorough,"If you are looking for a brief overview of everything, this book is for you. An developer/administrator looking for detail on any one topic will not find much use for this book."
1,Bad examples poor coverage,"I've read about 30 Oracle books. I wanted to find this book useful, but after 100 pages, I could not stomach it. Bad examples, poor verbiage, lousy structure, since oracle writers have little competition, the demands for quality are not that great. I found Sams series books much more useful."
3,Just OK,"It wasn't my cup of tea, however, it was still well written. If you are a fan of a more historical book on sub action during WW2 you will probably think it is ""just ok"" also. I started this book immediately after finishing Maru Killer, so my expectations were skewed after reading that one."
4,A fine sampler,"I purchased this CD to sample some of the pieces of Rimsky-Korsakov that I did not already own. The CD is a compilation of recognized conductors. The performances are competent, if not really inspired. Rimsky-Korsakov offers very listenable, approachable music and very rich orchestration. But this is a sampler, where most pieces are incomplete. If you are ready to jump in with both feet, purchase Scheherazade & Russian Easter Overture by Jose Serebrier, Scherazade & Cappricio Espanol by Mackerras/LSO, and Neeme Jarvi on Chandos ($$) for the rest.I was first put off by the sonics of this CD, particularly the dynamic range, but this varies with each of the many recorded pieces.In its favor, this CD is inexpensive, but don't expect to receive more than what you pay."
4,Fun CD,"I really appreciated the variety on this CD, from the light, bouncy bumblebee to the more bombastic pieces. I think this makes a really good intro to Korsakov's works."
3,Greatest hits,"Was a little disappointed with the CD. Was expecting more music that he is famous for, but instead, it had a number of little known works."
3,Radio broadcasts-- Recording Quality is Low,"I believe this is the same CD I purchased in a store here in San Diego. The songs are all the same and are in the same exact order. If so, it's all mono recordings of radio broadcasts. Sound quality is low. There's much better out there."
4,Good quality,"Good quality, easy to install. A little cumbersome trying to cut out the back plastic for the filter, but overall worth the money, and it is easy to clean."
2,potentially good,"I had such high hopes for this little printer which I thought would be in all ways spectacular because it was so expensive and a pentax after all.When I was successful in getting it to work with my computer, the print quality was very good. and it's such a good idea. Well I returned it."
4,Coat hooks.,Good quality hooks. Great price. Shipping seemed a little high but I still spent less than I would have to buy from my local hardware. Product arrived in about a week.
2,Vendor Switch,I purchased a 2nd set of Harbor Bay beach pants after liking the 1st set of pants so much. I ordered different colors and expected the same pants. When the order came in a note was in the box that they had changed vendors and these were an equal quality. The pants seem to be of a lighter material than the original and were longer in the legs and shorter in the seat. I have to take the new style pants to shorten the legs or end up wearing them out from stepping on them. Since pants of this size are hard to find I will most likely buy them again but will change to the ones with the elastic band at the ankles. If I could have worn them out of the box I would have given 3 1/2 stars!
5,Very Mature Sons,The Sons of Champlin have been around since 1967. They are as good but so much more mature these days. Their Music is still excellent. Most of the music is Bill Champlin's (from the band Chicago) and very polished. Not quite as raw as 39 years ago but just as satisfying as ever.....
4,Champlin Unleashed,"I started following Champlin's career after seeing him as the musical guest on ""Fridays"" 'way back in 1981 (imagine my surprise when he showed up as a member of Chicago on ""16"" the very next year). Simply put, the guy rocks.This new set by the Sons is a stylish revamping of their classic sound. All the old elements are there--the funky melodies, the wah-wah guitars, the back beats, the punchy horns (courtesy of Mic Gillette and Tom Saviano), plus Champlin himself is growling in fine form. There are no bad tunes on ""Hip Li'l Dreams,"" and there are several great ones, including ""For Joy"" and ""Star Outta You"" (a *terrific* indictment of today's cookie-cutter music scene).Recently, on ""Chicago XXX,"" Champlin has been able to break out with that classic band, penning and singing some of the best cuts on that set (""Already Gone,"" ""Better,"" ""Where Were You""); the Sons, however, seem to be his laboratory, and ""Hip Li'l Dreams"" is well worth having."
2,Von Karajan Dissapoints,"I love this piece. Unfortunately, this recording suffers in many areas. The sound is muddled. The soloists are just OK. But the primary sin is the choral singing - the heart and soul of the piece. The chorus is unprepared, or just incompetant. The choir is so muddled that one can barely make out the musical lines. Not a chance on discerning the words.What a shame for Bach and Von Karajan lovers. Go with the old, but beuatiful Eugene Jochum recording."
4,Great fit.,I have a 55 gallon aquarium from an unknown manufacturer that needed two lids. These fit perfectly and the price was great.
2,Wasn't cut straight,"I guess for the price I shouldn't complain much but the glass on my top was not cut straight. A very obvious curve was on the side of the glass and so I had to force the top down into my aquarium's rim. This probably wasn't a smart thing to do on my part but I'm not going to waste time shipping the item back and wait another week or more for a replacement. The glass also slips out of the plastic piece that allows it to be opened, possibly falling into the tank."
2,Wish I'd spent more,"This one is honestly worth what I paid. I wish I'd paid more. Sharp edges, hard pointy corners, I'm nervous to let my child use it. If you're looking for very inexpensive, and don't worry about such things, it IS worth it, but if you want to be a bit safer, spend a bit more."
3,No Story...,"I bought this book with the impression that there would be a brief 100+ pages of history as in the other books of the Army Lineage Series. I was surprised and greatly disappointed to find out that the Field Artillery edition does not. It only contains the brief regimental/battalion lineages and heraldic data, practically the same data you can get on the web. Oh well!?!"
1,Didn't send the one I ordered.,"I love these, have had them on all our vehicles since I was first married. Ordered this one to replace my husband's after he traded his vehicle, and received one for 'sister' NOT the one I ordered. Waste of money, won't be ordering from this company again."
4,Vraiment bon!,"Une des meileures bédés que j'ai lue!! c'est vraiment trop bon sauf que c'est assez court... l'action ne s'installe pas vraiment avant le deuxième, quand mme super bon!"
4,A remarkable read,"Duffy creates a fictional biography of Ludwig Wittgenstein, George Moore, & Bertrand Russell. While it sounds potentially dry, the storytelling is magnificent and leaves you feeling as though you've had some small contact with these brilliant characters. The emphasis on food is an odd characteristic, but very vivid. Dinner-table-talk plays a large role in spinning out the plot. While Duffy does not go into detail about the work of these three philosophers, there are references and remarks to fulfill any fan's expectations."
5,great find,"I bought this book in 1988. It then got buried under tons of other books until I unearthed it this weekend. What a great find. Rich characters, engaging prose...a thoroughly satisfying read. At 500+ pages, I'll admit it's a bit overwritten, but once you get going it's difficult to put down. Ranks up there with ""In the Memory of the Forest"" as gripping and memorable. Go work out really hard, take a hot shower, then grab an herbal tea and melt into its pages."
2,It appears he found the world to be quite boring...,"I have tried on several occasions to read this book. I have a problem with deliniating Duffy's style from his technique. Duffy's novel seems Proustian, but I'm not sure if his usage of long-winded and overly ruminative passages is his own style or a technique he intentionally employs to depict a trait he associates with philosophers. This aside, I thought the plotline of the novel was almost without significant incident which seemed remarkable to me since their respective biographies of Wittgenstein and Russell are fascinating. Wittgenstein and Russell were vibrant and tremendously interesting men, but this novel nearly succeeds in portraying them as stodgy and completely self-absorbed beings."
5,A miraculous book,"This rich, comic, poignant portrait of three of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century will, if nothing else, make you understand the spell cast by Ludwig Wittgenstein on so many people during his lifetime and after. Though the second half of the book is not quite as compelling and revelatory as the first (it could have done with some tightening), it is still better than 90% of the novels out there.Every time I reread it, I am struck anew by just how remarkable it is that a Christian American heterosexual should have entered so completely and sympathetically into the mind of the tormented, homosexual Viennese madman-saint who was Wittgenstein. That is, of course, what novelists are supposed to do but so rarely manage. Bravo."
5,Excellent introduction,"Clear explanation of the scientific basis and practical methods of Joseph Wolpe's approach to behavior therapy, with plenty of case examples."
2,The singing!,"My daughter (3yo) likes the BCC stories and characters. But this music, because it offers nothing visual, is something akin to torturous. The woman is not a skilled vocalist, and the songs are irritating at best. This is just not a pleasant CD to have around the house."
4,good movies,these were very good movies. i really enjoyed them. it took maybe a day or two to get them in the mail
1,Don't buy it,"Thank God I didn't have to pay for it, because it came with the BattleChest.Most of the book is dedicated to give solutions to the single player missions, as if the game was a tetris-like puzzle.And the rest is worse. The strategies are good for a novice, but anyone who has played a little can find huge flaws in it. Besides, it has some typos... like when it says Zerg Scourges are good against Terran Carriers..."
3,It's really not that great,"When I first started playing this game, the book was a great help. It maps out all the scenarios and makes recommendations as far as how to win each level. Aside from that, it doesn't really help at all. It doesn't teach you to be a better starcraft player, it just tells you the answers to the problems at hand. If you are looking for an easy way to win this game, then by all means buy this book; it helps out alot! But if you are looking for something to teach you general starcraft strategy, then I would suggest you look elsewhere."
1,Real Learning is Done on the Battle Field,"What a waste of my hard earned cash! Ive been playing this 5 star rts game since about a month after it came out, and I learned volumes more strategy than this guide provided me with for $20, and I learned it for free! Anyone thinking of buying this book should just sit down and jump on some multiplayer games and watch the different strategies that other people are using. With the combination of the creativity of a good opponent(and there are plenty out there), and your own inspired imagination, you'll go MUCH further than this book or any help guide can take you! Not to mention that following these 'skimpy' strategies that are listed in a book such a bore. There's something to be said about developing your OWN strategy and watching it in its success and glory! Dont buy it, save your money for the Brood Wars!"
2,"Save your money, don't buy this book.",I found this book to be unhelpful and unecessary. If you want incredibly obvious stratagies buy this book. It does however have intresting tables in the section on Terran building placement is invalueble.
1,Has the writer even PLAYED this game?,"Everything in this book is wrong, except for the unit stats, but even then some of them are outdated (but we won't hold that against prima). However, being how this was published 2 years after the original release of SC, you'd think that it would have some better multiplayer strategies than ""always pay attention"" and ""a good defense is a good offense."" The single player strategies consist of ""build cannons at choke"" and ""build big army."" Multiplayer strategy is a joke. If you really want to get better, go download some pro replays; this guide will just make your game worse."
2,Basics Only,Basic information. Some helpful - some copies of the user manual. Good help on scenarios. No help on playing multi-player.
4,To Aldarris,"The book says on p17""The Vulture is a hovercycle that's fast, powerful, and very effective when quick response time is critical."" It also says ""The Vulture uses Fragmentation Grenades as its primary weapon and, although they pack a decent punch, their effectiveness is dimished against heavily armored enemies"". You missed that part!"
3,"A so-so book, if your a newbie","First off, I really don't play computer games that much, but starcraft is an exeption.I bought this book the day I bought Starcraft. It did help some, but over a year or so later I realize that I, myself could make a better guide. There are few strategies, and because of that I really had nothing to mold my own off of. Your better off doing it yourself, and taking your time."
3,Has some problems,"You can tell by the Author's paragraph that the reviews that say there are many spelling errors in the book are right. It's shouldn't have an '. This book is okay for very new beginners, but many of its strategies are messed up."
2,This book only helps in the beginning,"If you can beat the first five levels you dont need this book. If you have played any game that you know is similar then you difinitely dont need it! It is like a the instructions but more depth. This book is ok. It helps some with everything. It helps a little with making campaigns and multi player games, but there are books for those which are very helpful!"
1,This book is one of the worsts I've ever read before,"The book says everything about single player games, but how come a great stragety game like this can be restricted to just the 30 single player missions that you can play in the campaign mode? No way! The book does not teach any useful strategy for general games against the computer or, much better, against human players. The real fun of this game is to play against human people, and the book will tell you only nonsense things about this. I really regret I paid for such a crappy book like this."
1,This book is useless.,"Sorry to rain on your parade, but this book is useless. The game is one of the greatest ever. But, there is little in this book (and less) than is in the manual Blizzard gives you, EXCEPT solutions to the campaigns. And if you follow the solutions, you are missing 99 percent of the fun. Prima usually does a real good job writing hint books that tell you how to play the game, but this book gives you nothing on general strategy, or explanation of the game itself. This book doesn't even have anything to say on the structures - the order to build them, etc. I had little trouble completing the campaigns before this book came out, and I am not the greatest player of games. So, if you absolutely must have solutions to the maps, get the book. If you want to have any fun with the game, don't. (And, I might add, the solutions I used were all different than what was in the book. There is no one solution.) Prima, you could have done better."
3,Pretty disappointing,"I think this book is not all that in-depth, & you definitely won't be expert just from reading it! The sections on campaigns are pretty dumb, as the maps aren't always very accurate, the advice can be misleading (such as: place a missile turret way out here undefended, even though a ground unit can just come by and kill it!), & they don't always have solutions, however some of them were very helpful. The general strategy section tends to repeat itself several times, but still has some great tips (such as ensnare cloaked wraiths). The multiplayer section isn't very specific, but still has some good general tips for attacking & defending. There are several spelling errors, map flaws, and one thing that annoyed me was they said how to prevent the firebat rush, but never actually said how to efficiently execute the rush as terran.The book could've included color pictures, race-combo stuff, the different rushes and how to do them, & more multiplayer stuff like drop tactics."
2,don't buy,"My fiance and I thought this book was very superficial and repetitive. We found it hard to spark discussion between us based on the questions it posses at the end of each segment. We didn't enjoy it and don't recommend it. Overall we got about half way through it before calling it quits, which in a sense brought us closer together, since we both decided the book wasn't getting us anywhere at the same time. I would recommend something like the Love and War devotional if you haven't already done it."
4,Nice buy,"I purchased this for my 1 year old daughter. The pattern was so cute and matched perfectly with her colors in her room. She is a little small for it, but will grow into it eventually. It has a very assembly. It doesn't state it in the instructions, but I used a little wood glue to help the backrest on the chairs. I thought two screws to hold the whole back together wasn't enough."
5,Excellent quality and affordable price ........,1. Very nice finish with vibrant colors2. Rounded kid-friendly design3. Easy to assemble4. Very sturdy (even I sit on it to tell some stories to my daughter)Added plus for us was that we had all white furniture for my daughter's room and it fits perfectly.
4,Great table and chairs,"My 18mo daughter has really loved this table and chair set. She received it for christmas. My only complaint is also a positive for a growing child. The table is alot taller than I expected and the chairs are smaller. The table is so tall I can sit at the table with my daughter (I'm 5'7""). We considered cutting the table legs down...but I think the taller table is nice as she continues to grow and grow. Also, other chairs can go under the table because of the height."
5,My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding,I have read other books by Sherrlynn Kennyon and knew that I would enjoy this one as well thank you.
2,Sorry but I really didn't like it!,"I have read books from most of the authors in this book and LOVED the books they wrote. But this one was really awful. The first story in the book was terrible, and I kept reading, thinking that the end would bring it all together. Nope! After that I tried to get into several of the other stories and they just lacked in... everything!I'm so sorry to say this, especially after being such a huge fan of most of the authors, but this one was bad. :("
4,95% good,"I enjoyed this collection very much, but a few stories were boring to me. It took me forever to get through the Hatfield wedding story and the Elvis story for some reason. I was bored with those, but otherwise, the book is great. A funny present for goth brides to be."
4,Great short stories,"I thought this collection of short stories were really good. I bought it for Charlaine Harris' (think Sookie Stackhouse/Trueblood) story. It was awesome and I also found some oher authors I liked. This was my first time buying a short story collection and I was happy with it. Some of the stories were hard to get through- because I wasn't a fan of the author's writing style- but you could always skip them. All in all I'm glad I bought it, it was worth the read."
2,severely disappointed,Severely disappointed is the only way to describe my reaction to this anthology. I ran right out to buy this book because of all the positive reviews. Save your money and buy it used.
1,if you can't get to sleep try this anthology,"Several of my favorite authors and what ho-hum stories. I felt they were churned out summaries of their typical storylines. I agree with the other reviewer and resent the $ spent. I felt it was written quickly for the fee only. Very disappointing. Wedding. Wizard. Save all. Done. There ya go! There's Jim Butcher's story! Want to read another: Dark Hunter. feels mortal dilemma of ""love"". Triumphs. Big Deal. Done."
1,"Other than Kenyon, awful compilation","I didn't like one story in this book other than Kenyon's, and even that wasn't her best. The book was actually so bad that I resent the money I paid for it. And to add insult to injury, the other book I bought that was a compilation including Kenyon was even WORSE. Just a total waste of money. Two of the stories are written in the first person -- and come on, are you a 12 year old writing a story for composition class? -- and all of them are hokey and, to be blunt, lame."
2,very dissapointing,I was very dissapointed in this book the only good story was Sherrilyn Kenyon's and it was far too short!I was really looking forward to this book and was extreamly dissapointed.
3,Half the stories were Excellent....but the rest were not good,"L.A Banks' story is awesome. It is funny, sad and fast paced. Sherrilyn Kenyon's contribution is terrible. This story almost made me give up on the DarkHunter series. As a Black woman, I felt slighted. Finally, a black DH and his story bites. A couple more were pretty good, but half sucked. Read at your own risk."
2,Not very interesting or fun,"I didn't love it. In fact it took me a month to read it. I'd flip through the stories, read one, skip the next...I eventually read all of them. I didn't like the L.A. Banks story at all, but then again, I hated ""Minion."" If I tried to write as ""ethnic"" as she does, my review would say, ""Oh vey! The schmaltz in that story made me messhugana! So much mishigas for a little shtup!"" Enough already. I liked the Charlaine Harris story, that was worth reading. Overall, phooey on this collection. I've read novels by most of the authors and enjoyed them more than the individual stories here, with the exception of Jim Butcher; I didn't like his Dresden books but thought the story here was well written and interesting. I really like the paranormal genre so this book was a dissapointment for me."
3,rvd vs. jericho,"This was just one of those weak WWF ppv's that just couldn't be helped. I mean they were good enough to rid us of the intolerable Kronik, but they did give us RVD vs Jericho, that match right there was my $30.00 for the pay per view."
3,WWF Unforgiven 2001,"WWF Unforgiven 2001September 23,2001Pittsburg,PennsylvaniaWWF TitleStone Cold vs Kurt AngleWCW TitleThe Rock vs Booker T & Shane McmahonWCW Tag Team TitlesUndertaker & Kane vs KronikWWF Intercontinental TitleEdge vs ChristainWCW US TitleTajiri vs RhynoPerry Saturn vs RavenWWF Hardcore TitleRob Van Dam vs Chris JerichoWWF Tag Team TitlesDudley Boyz vs Bigshow & Spike Dudley vs The Hurricane & Lance Storm vs Hardy Boyz"
2,a very good match betwenn 2 underrated greats,"that match is a hardcore match between rvd and y2jda match is a low contender 4 moty da moves da each men took has 2 be appreciated even if some of da moves where used n earlier matches so what it was a enjoy 2 seen them used again rvd proved y he was da new freakin show da at time where he could have ***plus matches with anybody and jericho was da king of da world capable of carrin harry potter and his magical broom 2 a *** classic and still let him do more movies about his skool yrs anyhow this match was ruined by pretty rich stephanie who stuck her nose n 2 other people's business she did da same thing i heard at next month's ppv ""no mercy"" she slightly ruined da endin 4 me here but nonetheless this match was a ****borderline classic if da match had a better endin with no interference it would have receieve a higher ratin"
5,Great product,This is a great product and I didn't have any shipping problems. My girlfriend loves it!!
2,watch looks great,"I would have rated this watch 5 bit unfortunately its not working. I don't know if the deal was for me to be the one to purchase the batteries. I haven't had time to buy a new battery or check why its not working but I will do that soon with local watch sellers here. Unfortunately I am all the way in Nigeria so the cost of shipping it back to the US and back here will be too expensive so I'll have to sort the problem out myself.The body looks great and very new as expected but I'm too embarrassed to wear it out for now, in case someone asks me for the time.It was delivered on time too."
5,Great slider,The sliders work very good. The instructions for mounting work good and allowed a perfect mounting of the sliders so that the table saw sled moved perfectly parallelto the saw blade.
1,Useless,"When i received this item ,I opened the box to find that it was dammaged.It had been nicked and bent. Note the box had no damaged at all.Who ever packed it had to see that it was Dammaged.I too pictures of it.When i was going to return it cost me more money. And it was my fault.I still have it And can not use it.Strickly the companys fault not mine."
2,Very Disappointed,"I notice a lot of people reviewing the show, and not the item. The Show is 5 stars, but this item only deserves 1 or 2. My box came and the stickers on the back ripped the artwork of the box, and every single disc was scratched due to them being packaged extremely poorly. They were just sitting in cardboard and i can't begin to explain how bad of an idea that was."
2,"2 of 23 discs in the series ""The Wire"" were bad","I bought ""The Wire: The Complete Series"".It took me a while to watch all of it. I found that 2 of 23 discs were bad.. Disc 5 of Season 2 has a bad spot in Episode 11 ""Bad Dreams"" that I had to skip past. Disc 2 of Season 4 the last half of Episode 6 ""Margin of Error"" and ALL of Episode 7 ""Unto Others"" are bad, completely unplayable, couldn't even skip to any good spot.The printed notice with my order said said to email the seller directly, and he would respond with 48 hours. I have emailed twice, but there has been no response. Nor has there been any response to the Amazon ""email to seller""."
1,Best show ever - worst product ever,"I read the reviews warning me about the packaging and performance of the disks. I love the show so much that ignored them when I found this set for a great deal. Needless to say, I'm disappointed. The discs are easily scratched and I'm plagued with skipping and slow-down during playback.Buy The Wire, season by season. Search for deals. Just do not by this package."
1,"Awful, awful packaging","Stay *away* from this set. These discs are packaged in the worst way that I've ever seen any disc set packaged.Shame on HBO for putting out such a horrible package.Your discs *WILL BE DAMAGED* when you get them. Mine were individually wrapped in plastic in the cardboard sleeves and many discs were scratched.And to HBO : What's wrong with packaging the discs in normal DVD cases, or in CD cases, or any any of the proven disc storage technology developed over the last 25+ years??"
1,Bad DVD's,"Great series, but the quality of the disks is poor. I had more than one disc that had spots that would freeze and or skip. I tried them in more than one dvd as well as computers to make sure it was the disks."
5,best TV show ever,This show was the best I've ever seen. It weaves multiple story lines in realistic portrayal of the city of Balitmore. Watch it!
5,A Must SEE,"Not to be redundant but The Wire IS the greatest series of all time. It contains some of the best acting, and writing, and directorship you will ever see. It authentically protrays Baltimore streets, way beyond the completely on-point accents. If you tend to shy away from a lot of cursing or violence maybe this show isn't for you. Season by Season there is a different theme each more surprising and intense than the last, it's truly hard to explain everything without giving too much away and way too complex for a plot summary. There are no good guys or bad guys here just human beings trying to make it the best way they can."
3,"good show, dvd quaility so so","I've only started on the second season, I bought the lot...the first season dvd skipped a bit, I hope I didn't miss much. I like the show in general though."
1,Series Great....DVDs not so much,"I agree with everyone else so far...The Wire is an awesome series, which makes it all the more frustrating when you get disk-skipping and read-errors on multiple disks...and I'm only up to Season Two. I would like to watch the show without pieces missing. So, to sum up: Show Good....DVDs bad. I tried them on three different dvd players and my computer, so it's not me! Good luck, folks."
5,"Good lord, this was amazing.","So I was a huge fan of ""THE SHIELD"" (gritty cop stories) AND ""L O S T"" (mind blowing story telling). THE WIRE is a majestic fusion of the two. Not that there are time traveling polar bears or anything, but the series is LOST-ish in the respect that all the characters unknowingly cross paths with each other and in the end your mind will be blown by the sneaky origin stories of your favorite characters....I.E. You see how Omar became Omar with out Omar even being there.... (boom!)W I R E.Is this the best show ever? Probably a solid contender for the title. I have never been so satisfied with a finale before. So good while being filled with such a tragic stroy of Baltimore crime. If it's good to be bad, this show is just gangsta, I suppose."
5,My Favorite TV Series of All Time.........,"Hailed by many critics as one of the greatest TV dramatic series of all time, HBO's ""The Wire"" is a major standout for writing, acting, direction.....and realism. I just finished my 12th complete viewing of all five seasons and I'm already looking forward to the next. With each viewing, I find myself going deeper and deeper into the story and the characters and I can't begin to tell you what a treat that is. I honestly think if I were marooned on that proverbial desert island with only one TV show to watch, I would be a happy man if that TV show was ""The Wire."" The boxed DVD set is a real gem, too, with tons of extra features that will please any die hard fan."
5,Stunningly Masterful Series,"This is hands down the best series ever produced for the small screen. Amazingly, lots of people didn't know this as it was being made, partly because it was shown on HBO, partly because people may have been afraid to really examine it. But when you finally get around to watching it, you WILL get locked in."
1,Don't purchase through patchadjian,"I ordered a brand new full edition set and the product came nicely packaged with shrink wrap, and it was the first time I saw every single disk was individually wrapped.The first few disks were fine. Other disks (and yes, there were MANY) had goo on them, were scratched, skipped around, and I had to end up paying for individual episodes on demand. I was extremely unhappy about this, and was hoping it was just an errant disk, but many of them (remember this was a 5 season show) were damaged.By the time I had gotten around to watching them, it was too late to return the items.Buyer beware!"
3,Advertisement is a little on the deceptive side,"I received the package pretty quickly. My only problem is that it was advertised in like new condition, but ""good"" would have been a lot more accurate. The box had some dings on the corners and the product itself, several of the enclosed DVDs had scratches on them....a lot of scratches. I'm someone that takes very good care of them and I have discs that are about a decade old and have almost or no scratches on them. And that include the discs that I frequently used. As long as the scratches don't cause any viewing problems then I can deal with it. to be continued...."
3,BAD PACKAGING SCARES ME OFF,"I HAD CONSIDERED PURCHASING THE COMPLETE SERIES OF ""THE WIRE"" UNTIL I LEARNED THAT THE PACKAGING OF THIS SERIES IS AS BAD AS THAT OF THE SOPRANOS WHICH I OWN BUT STRUGGLE WITH THE SAME POOR PACKAGING. DO NOT UNDERSTAND HB0 DOING SUCH A BAD JOB THE WAY THEIR DISKS ARE HANDLED. I OWN THE COMPLETE SETS OF CARNIVALE AND DEADWOOD THAT HBO PRODUCED WHICH ARE WELL PACKAGED SO I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE BIG DIFFERENCE."
1,Faulty DVDs,"This distributor is now working on the second try of getting me a functional set of DVDs of the wire. First, the problem was adhesive on the information side of the DVDs and missing DVDS (!). Now, the DVDs are scratched. You're better off going with someone else."
1,Seller won't reply to emails,"I ordered the entire 5 season Wire Series. I had watched Season 1 and got hooked. I was going to order to own and pass around to my friends. Once I received the series it took almost 2 months to get to season 5 where I discovered that one of the Season 5 DVDs was actually labeled wrong and was a repeat of a previous season. I understand that happens and ended up viewing those episodes on Amazon, but decided to contact the seller to notify and see if anything could be done. I've attempted twice over approximately 3 weeks now and haven't even gotten an acknowledgment of my email. I attempted to contact more as a notification since it had been awhile, but that the seller hasn't taken the time to acknowledge my email is disappointing and now is making me feel like I should have gotten a replacement DVD. I won't order from this company again and wouldn't recommend this seller any longer. Customer service is important."
1,one of the best shows but horrible packaging,"very very good show. Had to give low rating based on packaging. Will have to put discs into a binder because packaging is not good for storing. Also it was quick delivery time but the way it was shipped was very poor. The dvd box set was taped together from the sender so the the box set box is ruined as well it was all dinged up and bent out of shape. It was shipped in a small box with none to very little padding or paper to protect the dvd box. Now to the box set itself. 1st each dvd comes in a thin plastic sleeve which is stored in a cheap cardboard fold out with a place to put each disc. Also disc condition is not great. I owned the third season of the wire before and that box set packaging was superb, HBO should have spent a little bit more to do the same with the complete set. I wish i would have read the reviews instead of just looking at the seller rating."
4,The Wire,"We received our delivery a bit later than anticipated, but only by a few days. The product was brand new in box as expected. We have started to watch the series and while there has been one disc so far with what appears to be a factory blemish that did interfere with one of the shows, the product seems fine otherwise."
3,"Good series, way too many DVDs","The series itself is outstanding, but the packaging of this disk set is excessive. They only have 2 or 3 episodes on each DVD, which is ridiculous. They could easily fit an entire season plus extra materials on a couple of disks. It seems they spread each season across as many DVDs as they possible to justify a higher cost, as if more disks equaled more value. So get ready to keep switching disks. There is no documentation, only a list of episodes on the inside flap of each season, so no character references or plot summaries. It would have been useful, but wouldn't justify jacking up the price even further, so why should HBO bother?"
3,As a HBO Mini Series goes this one is just OK,Maybe I've seen too many cop shows but something is missing here.I own many of the complete HBO series productions.Out of all of them this one is my least favorite.Its a story that seems to unfold too slow.I don't like the cast as well as other HBO shows.No one sticks out as exceptinal.Add up both and you get bored watching this.And I still have 2 seasons to go.
1,The series is in 4x3? WTF??,"So I LOOOOOVVES me some Wire. I was HUGELY excited to receive the boxed set.And then I put in a disc.It's all in 4x3: WTF?? People it's 2011 ... The series was shot in widescreen HD (I watch weekly episodes on DirecTV, channel 101).Of course, I can't return it b/c it's open. So, I am stuck in an unhappy place, and the dollars are gone.TOTAL BUMMER."
1,not as described,"Described as new. Had a missing disk, scratches everywhere. Definitely now new. Returned for a full refund including shipping"
1,Never arrived,"It's impossible for me to review this product as the seller never sent it nor did the seller ever return any of my emails. Amazon, however, was fabulous in getting me a refund on my money. Yes, the seller did get that!"
4,The Wire complete dvd series,"Purchased complete series - only through season 2. Love the series - would recommend. Had trouble with one disc in season 2; would stop periodically. Hopefully, the rest of the discs won't have this problem."
3,"DVDs not like new, but CS refunded.","This DVD set was titled as ""like new"". Box looked great, but DVDs inside were not in ""like new"" shape. Few minor scratches were apparent, but one DVD in particular wouldn't even play. Some of the interior casing was unglued. I complained to customer service and asked for a refund or another set of the DVDs. Within 48 hours customer service responded, apologized, explained they didn't have replacement DVDs, and offered me a full refund. They promptly refunded me fully. Altho disappointed the DVDs did not play properly I was very happy with their customer service."
2,The Wi,I just couldn't seem to get into it only watched 1st season so far - i'll finish it but not high on my list
1,"Bought ""new"" got used","The discs aren't even playable. I got played. Scratches everywhere. This'll teach me to shop online just to ""save"" $40 instead I wasted $80."
1,If The Packaging Is So Poor...,Why is the price for the complete first (and only) three seasons more than the total price of each season purchased individually? ($37.49 x 3 = $112.47 as opposed to $138.99. The complete first three seasons is $26.52 more.)
1,Do Not Order From This Seller,"I placed my order on 8 February 2010 and the expected delivery date was for 18 February through 1 March. Needless to say, I have yet to receive my item even after emailing the seller.Does anyone have a phone contact for the seller?"
2,Decided not to buy,"Please don't make your decision based on what I say, just my decision, my sole decision is based on the negative reviews, and it's not in blu ray, in addition I have most but not all in standard DVD"
2,Very disappointed,I have two new DVD Players and it would only play on one. The dvd stalled and was not able to play on the majority of the dvd's on my JVC PLAYER and would not play on the Philips at all. Very disappointed in the quality of the movies that were very expensive
4,Great show poor packaging,This is one of the greatest TV cop drama shows of all time. Sadly the same cannot be said for the package it comes in. The outer advertisement removed some of the paper on the box even though I removed it carefully. Also the sleeves the discs are in scratch the DVD's. Some of my sleeves don't even appear to be glued together and the discs roll around.The show is five stars but due to the packaging this gets 4 stars.
2,Great series ruined by shoddy boxed set,"I owned season 5 and wanted a complete set of what I consider the best TV offered in the last decade. At least 2-3 discs in three different seasons were seriously flawed with skips, pauses and other imperfections that one should not expect from a new item at this price.Pay the extra money and buy the individual seasons!!!!"
2,"Amazing show, terrible packaging with scratched disks","The Wire is one of the greatest shows ever made for television. It is thought-provoking, complex, and incredibly well-done.The packaging this set of DVDs comes in is absolutely terrible. It is flimsy and completely incapable of protecting these valuable disks against damage during transport. I've gone through most of the DVDs in the package so far, and out of about 20 disks that I've tried, at least 7 of them have given me read errors. I have had to use special software to recover the data and make these DVDs watchable.Do yourself a favor and watch the Wire in another manner. I don't know if the single season DVD sets also suffer from the same problem. If not, they may be a better solution.I cannot believe that such a fine show is being distributed in such a shoddy manner."
2,Terrible packaging ruins great series,The DVDs in this are loosely held in thick paper cases. Rather than being held securely in snap cases most of the discs in the set shifted in delivery. The result was that about 17 of the 23 discs were heavily scratched and half the episodes were unplayable.I cannot promise that you will have the same unfortunate event as myself in your delivery but I purchased the set Brand New and it still came to me in worse shape than if I bought them used. Although it may be more costly this series is so good it would probably be worth it to puchase the seasons individually. Personally I have watched the entire series twice and it only improves with successive viewings. Just make sure you get DVDs that are better packaged than the ones in this set.
3,Very Good Service!,"I orered this dvd box set, but did not know that it was about 30 different dvds that came in the set and being that im disabled and have limited mobility,i had to send it back. The seller was incredible with the whole return process. Thanks so Much!!!"
5,Top Drawer Service,"The product arrived a lot quicker than I expected it to. So, needless to say, I was thoroughly pleased by that. The DVD was in the condition promised. So, I have no complaints whatsoever."
5,Epic,"""The Wire"" is such a deep show. Like others said, it can take a few episodes to entrench yourself in it, but after watching every episode I find myself reminiscing about them and wishing there was more. All the underlying themes, characters, and heartbreak are truly genius."
2,"Classic series, inferior DVDs","The Wire is beyond doubt the greatest tv series that I have ever seen. That's not the issue. Rather, I write this review to alert fellow consumers to the fact that this set is extremely cheaply produced. It is so bad that had I not spent the money myself, I would have concluded that it is a bootleg. Which begs the question- is it a bootleg? The quality of the recording is just poor. None of the DVDs play through without skipping etc. The box and other packaging is equally wanting. Again excellent content but disappointing box set."
5,Greatest TV series of all time,"The Wire is hands down the greatest television series of all time. From Time magazine to Entertainment Weekly, the show has received enormous critical success. It tackles the real issues that face America from the drug trade, to poverty, to political corruption, and does so in an almost poetic manner.I watched the series with my dad, mom, and brother, and despite their different tastes in what they enjoy watching, they all absolutely loved the show. It's that kind of series that no matter who you are, what your tastes are, and what your background is, you will love it. Highly recommended."
3,disappointed with mixed quality of CDs,"I received the item on time as promised, but the product was NOT mint condition as claimed. Several disks in Season One had minor damage, but Season Four disks had major problems throughout - the picture was pixilated or fuzzy or distorted on most disks. They were obviously not produced well - poor quality. Don't know what to expect on disks in Season Five. Seller should watch all the CDs before claiming they are mint condition.I love the program and had hoped to watch the whole thing many times without viewing problems."
1,Don't buy it!!!,"I just bought the package for a special occasion 6 months ago. Unfortunately, we began to watch the DVDs only recently and some of the DVDs can NOT be read on the DVD player or the computer, worst than that trying to read the DVD makes the DVD player and the computer do a very strange noise...!Besides, a DVD is simply missing!!So if you want to spare some money, don't buy this package! It's such a shame that people sell this product.I really hope that my review might help somebody."
2,Mislabeled dvd,"The dvd's arrived in a timely manner as indicated by the seller; however, upon viewing the dvd's it seems that disc 1 of Season 5 is mislabeled. When I actually played the disc it showed the last two episodes of Season 4. So I now have two discs (one mislabeled) of the last two episodes of season 4, and no disc for episodes 1-3 of Season 5. The show itself is amazing, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something gritty to watch."
4,the wire - complete series,the product arrived earlier than expected and is in new condition as described. very pleased.
4,Amazing show - disc quality not so amazing...,I got this as a present for my husband - he was excited - this was one of the best shows HBO put out. The only problem is the disc quality - two episodes in season one didn't play all the way through or parts were not read by disc player :( we are in season two and no problems so far - i will be emailing customer service to see what they can do.
1,DON'T DO IT!!!,"Before I bought this i read the reviews on how bad the set was, stupid of me to go and buy this box set anyway instead of just buying each season individually. When the box set finally came I took one dvd out to see it had minor scratches, ignoring this I put the dvd in the player only for it to tell me it was unable to read the disc. I tried the other ones only to find out that they won't play either. Now Im pissed because I really like this show and bought it to watch but it is obvious that HBO doesn't give a F about The Wire or you because they would have put these dvd's in a normal dvd case instead of a piece of construction paper."
1,Buyer Beware,"The series itself is excellent but it doesn't matter how good it is if you can't play it. As many many others have found out the packaging and production of this set by HBO is horrible! Fully a third of dvd's have problems, skipping, freezing or not playing episodes at all. Had I the chance to do it over again I would definitely get the individual seasons and not the box set, at least from what I've heard those don't have any playback issues. FYI I have played the bad dvd's on two different players makes no difference. The only way I can get some of the worst ones to play is to play via my pc, as said buyer beware."
1,"Good TV, worst DVDs ever","I own over 1000 DVD titles. Never have I had such a bad experience. I am just finished with season 1 which I managed to see after struggling with skipping and un-readability issues on some episodes. the 2nd disk of the 2nd season is unusable. I am trying to read it on multiple DVD players and computers and can't get more than a few minutes going. I wish I had seen the other reviewers reporting this issue. This also explains why amazon are not selling it - probably had too many returns and dropped the product.Ironic since each disk is individually wrapped in a nylon sleeve.While I am sure many of you want to own this series, save yourself the money and frustration. get it on demand on HBO GO for free if you can."
1,Every single DVD is scratched,"My girlfriend recently bought me a brand new copy of The Wire box set off Amazon. Every single DVD was scratched, some so badly that they aren't even playable. I emailed HBO about getting a replacement set, and it's three days later and I haven't heard anything back from them. DO NOT BUY."
2,"Great Show, Terrible case","You are getting a great series at great price. The casing it comes in looks nice and is good for display but terrible for protection. It will scratch your disc. If you take all the disk out and put them into a cd holder, then a great buy. If not, it will not last very long."
2,"Good show, bad package.","The Wire is an excellent show but I expect much better packaging for the price paid, taking off the advertising stickers on the box actually ripped it!"
3,Poor video and audio on this pricey item,"I saw The Wire on TV, and wanted to own the series as it doesn't air very often. The boxed set was delivered promptly. Packaging is not very good; the discs tend to fall out when the sleeve is handled. There is a lot of stalling, skipping and gaps on a few of the DVDs. Audio is poor; have to boost the volume way, way up to hear the sound track. Great series, but a mediocre reproduction of the media, in my opinion."
2,"horrible packaging, poor disk quality",The Wire series was excellent. The disk quality was average/poor at best. But the packaging was a joke. Had to place all dvds in my own holders as the so called box fell apart.
1,Defective disks,"I am into the 3rd season and the disk is defective it skips forward. It is unwatchable, avoid the box set it is damaged goods. I hope I can get my money back."
2,UGH! DVD Quality is Sub-par,"Please note: this review is not geared toward The Wire as a TV show (the show is FANTASTIC).My reason for giving 2 stars is that the DVD quality of this product is VERY poor. All of the discs we have watched so far have digital ""crackling"" happening where the picture on the screen gets all pixelated. Beyond being annoying it disrupts the viewing of the TV show.Buyer beware. You might want to pay more and buy directly from HBO...."
2,"Great Series, dont buy this Complete Set","This is a great series. One of the best of all TV. Right behind The Shield for me.My one problem comes with packaging itself. It's beyond awful. The discs are placed in baggies and as a result the discs are prone to scratching(Lost 3 seasons because of it.)Here's my advice, watch the series, but get the seasons individually. AVOID THE COMPLETE SET AT ALL COST."
5,"Amazing show, great investment","I think my favorite TV show ever made. Such a worthy investment-every time I see an episode again I fall more and more in love with the show, the actors, the script, the cinematography. It's incredible. Really sheds light on current social issues and the blurry lines between good and evil. Absolutely fantastic show, love the box set."
5,HBO created another winner.,"This 23 disc series (covering 6 seasons) offers a fascinating view of inner city ghetto life -- and for those of us not into the jargon, we can use the closed captioning to help us understand. As with other HBO series such as the Sopronos, we are presented with complex characters in which we get to see the humanity of even drug dealers who are willing to murder others, and the greed and duplicity of those who risk their lives to maintain a civil society.The series is not appropriate for young viewers due to its focus on the seedier side of life in which profanity, violence and crime are the norm rather than the exception. But for adults, it has a captivating mix of suspense, action and character development that puts it on par with many of TV's great police dramas."
4,wasnt all the way happy but it will do,"i ordered the wire the complete series after watching a couple episodes and was immediately hooked, it arrived couldnt wait to get a marathon going, but my viewing pleasure was interrupted by dvd that would skip or not all the way work, i watched what i could but luckily i could catch the other episodes some where else was going to send it back but decided to keep it the seller gave me a partial refund and i was ok with that... not sure why the episode skipped also the disc looked good could be when they were makinng the dvd set."
3,The Wire: The Complete Series,"The DVD quality was excellent. The shipping package by supplier was fine. However the quality of the packaging of the DVD's in the package was poor. The wrappings/sleeves of each CD was deplorable. Not sure how to screen the CD packaging when ordering a series thet contains multiple, 5+, CD's."
2,Series was great but DVD quality was terrible,"I bought 'The Wire: The Complete Series' (from Amazon) for my brother's birthday. I wondered why he didn't seem too enthusiatic about it ... until I borrowed the set. I watched about three episodes and discovered that the quality was so bad it was unwatchable - the picture shaked so much it made me giddy. $200 wasted! I shall never buy dvd's online again.The Wire series however, I hired from a video store, and I enjoyed it very much."
3,Great Series... terrible packaging.,"This series features excellent writing, great writing and directing, and nice performances from an ensemble cast. It's well on its way to becoming one of my all-time favorites.The drawback to this collection is the packaging. The folders for each season start coming apart with opening and removing one of the discs. It's a real shame that such a fine series collection arrives in packaging not designed to hold up to regular use."
4,Great series,"The Wire was/is one of my favorite TV shows ever. The only season that was a little slow was season 2, not as much action, but still amazing.The box set does not come with anything spectacular. The ""Three prequels explore life before The Wire"" were about thirty seconds each, not what I had hoped. I still haven't watched the ""Never-before-seen gag reel""; I do not feel like being disappointed again.I must have purchased it on a good sale day; I think I paid about $80.00, not sure if I would pay the current price of $114.99"
1,Thanks a lot Amazon!,"Purchased this set months ago because of all the acclaim this series received. I received the set months but did not get around to start watching it until this week. Just when I start getting in to the show, I attempt to put the 3rd disc from season 1 in, only to realize that some how, Amazon gave me two copies of disc 2. In other words, I am missing episodes 6, 7, and 8. Ended up having to read those episodes on the Internet so I wouldn't be lost."
5,greatest TV series of all time,"The Wire is quite possibly the best television series of all time- a statement that seems to be confirmed by anyone who has seen it. It is literature in visual form. Great acting, fantastic music, unforgettable characters and a storyline that touches on every aspect of urban life. Want to know the reasons behind the modern situation- watch the characters in the Wire try to unravel the connections between drug dealers, politicians, public image, organized crime, the school system, and human nature.TV at its absolute best in a 60 hour box set."
2,"Very labored writing, too few completely worked out examples","I refer to the latest edition of this text by Mano and Kime. I tried to teach Comp. Architecture to a senior level BS class (in CS) from this book. The problem is that this book attempts to do too much and it wanders all over the subject area, leaving the students lost since they just cannot grasp the ""big picture"". This book gets progressively worse with every new edition! I had to extensively edit the contents to prepare lecture notes which could be comprehended. Halfway through the semester, when I came to the part on ""microprogrammed control"", I gave up and switched to Tanenbaum (Structured Comp Organization) instead. I would appreciate it if anyone could tell me about a better book on this subject. All the ones that I have looked at seem to be terrible in one way or another."
3,Detailed but missing some essentials,The book gives a detail introduction to computer hardware but it does not have some basic essentials: 1. No answers to the end of chapter problems were given. 2. No examples to problems with full solutions 3. No end of chapter reviews or glossary at end of text.A study guide would be nice too.
2,Caution! This book could hurt your academic career,"As a student with an perfect record (GPA:4.0)with but a single class to go until graduation, I felt so uncomfortable with this text that I dropped the course. The meandering and lack of technical elaboration was frustrating and confusing. I felt it a shame that any University would approve such garbage. It is enough to make one curious about whether money is being exchanged under the table between the book publishers and schools."
4,Very good for an introductory course,I had this text for a course more than a decade ago. I found everything very easy to understand and still refer to the book when I want to know something about computer architecuture. It is very complete at the introductory level. My main complaint is the book introduces too much old-fashioned CISC with its microcode and single accumulator register before introducing RISC later on. In a modern course the order should be reversed since I believe most students would find RISC to be clean and sensibly designed while the CISC examples in this book make for tedious reading.
3,Needs a little work...,"I've grown a love hate relationship with this book.I love it, because after attending a lecture in school and then reading the chapter from which the lecture was built on, I find the book to be an excellent resource of information. It'll clear up any confusion which I had, aswell as reitterating all the points discussed in class.I hate it, because I can't read ahead. Anytime I have tried to read a chapter which we have not yet learned, I have had a difficult time grasping the concepts and gaining an overall perspective of what the chapter is trying to teach you.If you are planning to learn all this material on your own without the benefit of a professor's teachings, then I probably would not reccommend this book to you. If on the other hand, you do have some other source of learning and are just looking for an additional source to keep your mind fresh on the topics (and maybe even learn a little more while your at it), then this book is for you."
3,Misleading description of the book status,"The book was described as brand new. However, I received an email after the book was shipped apologizing for some highlights within the book pages. I found this deceiving in a sense."
2,Not suitable for undergrads,"This was the required textbook for my 300-level CIS course, and I found it to be highly disappointing.The initial few chapters are manageable, albeit extremely dry reading. Subsequent chapters offer a frustrating paradox: they seem to overload the reader with details, and yet not enough explanatory detail of the aforementioned details for reader comprehension. It suffers mostly from ""stating"" information instead of ""explaining"" it.This book is (perhaps) best suited as a general review text for people already in the know, although it may not even be appropriate for that task. Difficult to read, not enough examples/explanatory detail, unimaginative illustrations...all-in-all an inexplicable choice for an undergraduate textbook, and certainly offers help to neither professor nor student."
3,A weaker entry in a great series,"Definitely Dead is Harris'6th entry is her wonderfully imaginative and fun Southern Vampire series. Unfortunately, it goes nowhere and does not advance the characters or the series. It reads like a book she is contractually obligated to write or, perhaps, she just needs to slow down her torrid pace of writing and take a sabbatical. I hope it is a bridge book to a super 7th novel, but I'm not holding my breath."
4,really like this one,alot of people are saying this book wasn't very good but i really liked it :) it was a fast read & kept me wanting more.. all together dead however is turning into a bore snooze!! i loved Quinn being added to the mix & her being in her cousins apartment meeting amelia..
2,Huh? and What?,"This is the worst in the series so far. It opens with a death (of course!) but we don't know who the character is. I made sure I read the other books in the series and I had, so I kept going. Later on, I read that there was some short story that ties to that. I must admit that it really makes me angry when an author does that. They assume that we read everything they write and know when they tie something in. I spent the first section of the book just trying to figure out who this person was and what was going on. It was, literally, like there was a book 5-1/2. Very disappointing.The story, maybe because of that, was very disjointed. I found myself not caring who Sookie was 'in love' with, just wanting her to shut up and make a decision already. That made the story a little disjointed as well.This could have been a good story if the author had pulled it together (and not started out assuming we read everything she writes). Meh."
4,Sixth in the Series,"I am glad to read some other reviews as I have been trying to figure out how I missed the 'book' on Hadley and that whole series of events? Possibly it'll be in a novella or other collection? Someone should ask Charlaine what happened there. I also think Quinn is a great new character, as is the Queen, hope we see more of her!Off the topic... someone should ask her what the heck happened with True Blood. Did she give up all rights to the series? Other than Sookie and Sam, many of the characters have little to do with thir character in the books (and are much scuzzier looking/acting than we expect from the books) and all the weirdo's that have been introduced.... and the liberties taken with the book characters!! The books have a sense of humor... this series is grim and grimer. Wow."
3,Definitely Dead,Book was good but with each new character something about the story seems to be lost. Like the parts with the vampires more than the weres
4,Easy Read,"Such easy and entertaining reading. I love Charlaine's wayof writting. The content, of course, is pretty far fetchedand ""wacko"", nevertheless, I am totally sucked into the series."
5,guilty pleasure,I'm down to the last one of these books and cheesy or not I have really enjoyed the whole series. They have been my summer fun read.
5,LOVE,I absolutely love this book. I don't watch the HBO tv show but I'm thinking about starting because the books are great.
3,Too much Quinn!,"These books just keep getting more and more exciting! I really thought that the whole series was going to focus on Sookie and Bill's relationship, come to find out its all about Sookie. I love her revolving door of love interests. She always has some sexy hunk lurking in her life and she's not the best at resisting their advances.This book lets us into the political side of the vampires. We get to meet the Queen of Louisiana and we also are let in on the drama surrounding her recent nuptials. We also find out about a long lost member of Sookie's family, Hadley, who had become a vampire without letting her family know.When Hadley is murdered Sookie must go to New Orleans to settle her estate. She has more than one enemy after her, and is constantly dodging bullets. Things really get interesting when Sookie finds out a little more than she ever wanted to know about that snake Bill.Another exciting installment in the addictive Sookie Stackhouse series!"
4,Sookie and a suprise,Sookie and friends are back and have surprises. I really wish she and Eric would get together.. but this book has surprises galore and will definetly have the reader wanting the next one.Who in her family gave her fairy blood?What does that mean for the future of Sookie? I wish Sookie would get another cat...What about the butt~head Bill?and does Sookie have a future with her Tiger boy or is Eric gonna wake up?/Waiting for the next one..Readers of this one will also like her new series about Toliver and Harper. Grave Sight and coming soon Grave Surprise.
4,"Missing for years, still can catch up...","I started reading this series when it first came out, and stopped (because of sheer volume of reading material at hand).A friend gave me this book the other day, knowing I had read some of the earlier books. First off, let me state, if you haven't read at least 2 or 3 of the earlier books, you will be LOST in this book. However, if you do have the basics of what's happened in the past, then...this book is just great. Fast paced, characters that grab at you, from first scene to last. Sookie is one of the most sympathetic series leads I've ever read, and she continues to be so. She's no superwoman, yet she holds her own amongst the monsters. This plot is very complex, and there's so much going on, that the book keeps you from page one.IF YOU'VE READ OTHER SOOKIE BOOKS this is a great summer read.(*)>"
4,Definitely Dead,I love all of her books. I read everyone in a few weeks time. They are addicting and love that the characters follow from one novel to the other. They have a family-like feel to them. Her books are exciting and fun.I highly recommend them.
5,Definitely gotta read Definitely Dead,"Like all the Southern Vampire novels, this is a must read. Sookie is off to New Orleans to deal with her late (vampire) cousin's estate - who happened to be the significant other of the Queen of Louisiana. I liked this book a lot, but it isn't my favorite Sookie book. I like the one's that are a little more steamy. Sookie has a new romantic interest in this book, and Eric and Bill have bit parts, but Sookie is playing it cool, still, and not giving it up for anyone."
3,"No surprises, but a nice book in a series.","As part of a series, this is definitely not the book to start with. The first book, Dead Until Dark, is still the best followed with Dead to the World - a book centering on Eric and Sookie. Yet, this one moves the storyline along. A short story, Bite (part of an anthology) comes before this novel and serves as a good summary of the events that follow in this tale. I miss the love triangle between Bill, Sookie and Eric. But she does answer a number of questions and brings up enough to make one willing to wait for the next book. Overall, still funny, still interesting."
5,Need I review?,Anyone that loves Charlaine Harris knows this is a great series. My only gripe is I read through them too quick and want more stories!
5,Definetly Dead,I love this series. Its totally addictive. The book was in good condition and arrived quickly. No complaints here!
2,not as good as the other's but tolerable.,"i watched true blood, and got turned on to the sookie books. i love the first 4!! definately dead is icky, and whenever her new boyfriend called sookie""babe"", i rolled my eyes everytime. this book just didn't have the charm to it for me. i have read them all and this is my least favorite."
5,Sookie Stackhouse....what can you say Another Great Book,"As always with Sookie Stackhouse and the cast of characters a great read. Thanks Charlaine. Give the first Sookie Stackhouse book a read and you will be hooked. Nice, easy read includes some comedy, little spice, little love and many interesting characters!So go traveling on the adventures of Sookie Stackhouse and escape the real world for a little while, you won't be sorry!"
1,Bloody BORING!,"I think this marks the end of my experience with the Sookie Stackhouse series. If I was disappointed with Dead as a Doornail, I am positively annoyed with Definitely Dead. This little book literally took me an entire month to read because I could only handle little spurts of it before my mind would wander, my eyelids would droop and I would completely loose interest. Hear me when I say that nothing, absolutely nothing exciting happens in this book. It's about 20 pages of plot and 300 pages of filler. In place of character development, Harris adds about 50 more forgettable characters to the scene that, I repeat, add NOTHING to the story and serve only to make a bland story read like a phone book. Ugh...pass.."
5,Sookie Stackhouse Saga,"If you are looking for a highly addictive, great series of books, then this is it! These books from Charlaine Harris will not disappoint you."
4,Good book,"This book was pretty good. I have read the almost the entire Sookie Stackhouse series, and have enjoyed the storyline in most. Some of it is a little redundant and although I understand that the repeat parts of the book are to remind one of what they previously read and also not to turn someone away who picked up this book by accident not knowing that it was in the middle of a series but it does get tiring. Also Charlaine Harris has great storylines but in my personal opinion is not a fantastic writer. She does not capture your attention like J.K. Rowling or Stephanie Meyer. But still a good book if you just pay attention to the storyline and not the writing style."
4,Sookie Stackhouse series,I have enjoyed each one of Charlaine Harris's books in the Sookie Stackhouse series. She is able to keep the reader wanting more.
5,another excellent book...,"This is another wonderful book in the Southern Vampire Series. The best part is that it's a stand alone book. I have friends that I pass books on to after I've read them and it's always great not having to read the whole series to understand the book.What a wonderful author...I think I'll get Grave Sight next, but I'll miss Sookie, till the next book."
3,A Filler in a Fantastic Series,"Definitely Dead had very little Eric in it. Therefore, I liked it less than I have liked the other books in the series.Yes. I am that reader. I love this series. I love True Blood. But I love me some Eric Northman even more. When Eric is around I am a happy girl. When he just drops in every 100 pages or so (and when Sookie gets another weird shifter boyfriend) I get sad.But even despite the lack of Viking hotness, Definitely Dead was again a fun book. True, it didn't have the drama that some of the others in the series have had, but that might have been the point. I felt like Dead was a filler book for Harris. She gave me information that I will need later on, but I didn't really get intrigued about the actual events in this book.Lovers of the series, and of True Blood, will like this book for the background information it gives and for the additional time with Sookie and her crazy cohorts."
3,Not To Bad,"Sookie heads to her cousins Hadleys apartment to clean it out, she also was the Queens girlfriend. Meets the landlord who happens to be a witch. I enjoyed that character. The King and Queen are preparing to marry and the Queens bracelet that she received as a gift from the King is gone because Hadley stole it. So Sookie has to think on her feet to fix this crisis before the King will have a chance to end her. I enjoyed what was written about what was left in Hadley's home. There's a big shocker in the middle of the book regarding Sookie's love life that may make some readers happy and others upset."
4,why are they hot for Sookie?......,"like many other fans of the series, the increasing male supernatural characters getting lathered up for Sookie in previous books was getting a bit odd and off putting. Finally, in book six, we learn there may be a supernatural reason for their lust-though I will not blow it for you. Needless to say, it was a quirky new addition to the Southern Vampire world built by Ms. Harris.Overall, I really enjoyed book 6, though it did have as many flaws as perfections. Like other reviewers, my biggest complaint was the sudden introduction of Sookie's cousin Hadley storyline. The story was introduced like such a ""given"" that I wondered if I had somehow missed it in a previous book. It seems like it was actually introduced in a short story, so I have to knock off half a star for thoroughly confusing this reader. Bad Charlaine! LOLBut there was enough supernatural action, laughs, drama, and Southern sexiness to satisfy this reader.4.5 stars-recommended!"
3,Disappointing after the first four!!,"As a solid character, Sookie has a lot of promise and is developing a little of her own after a crash course in the supernatural inhabitants that surround her ever expanding world. But, she's also become a little too judgemental of that world with very little to go on, outside what she's been able to intuit from Bill and Eric and her involvement with them through the first four books. And what she does to Bill is downright scandalous! She comes off as a damning judge rather than an activist who just might be able to make a difference with her abilities. Snippy, as one critic called her. Try downright whiny and childish! Too little lease given to the other major characters as well. Don't turn Sookie into a self-serving baby, Charlaine. After what she's experienced, her character is far better than you've built her to in this book!"
5,Book 6 rocks!,"I find myself really liking Miss Sookie. This volume in the series really gets into her psyche more than in any other volume, she makes a lot more decisions for herself, rather then for a man, or other people. I like it when she branches out and shows some independence and she does that a lot in this book. I am really glad I started this series from the beginning, because book six uses a lot of references from all her other books, and if you haven't read them, you will not understand this book. Also she has been changing the endings... book five and book six both ended the book with a question mark and that is really intriguing, because it makes me want to quickly start reading the next installment. Thank goodness I bought them in a set, or I would be going totally crazy trying to rush out and find book 7. I am sad to know that I must be getting to the end of the series, simply because I have come so far. I know that series can't go on forever, I just really hope that it ends well."
2,Boring,"I really look forward to this series. Her characters are ones that I find have ""personality"" or at least developed some over the series.However, this book was just plain boring. The story didn't go anywhere at all. The whole missing braclet -- she didn't explain to the reader what was going on when she found it -- she told Quinn but we couldn't read about it for 40 more pages until she went to the reception. I found the whole vampire reception confusing. More back story should have been provided.I believe that even the author felt that this wasn't the best -- the last paragraph of the book sums up all the untold plots and story lines that were not covered.And, the very last page of the book encourages us to read something else for a change of pace. Perhaps this author is just burned out on these characters.If you are on the fence, don't even bother reading this one in the series. You missed nothing of any importance in Sookie's life."
1,Tedious beyond belief!,"Ben was a Were, not simply a Shape Shifter, which made him different from Amy inasmuch as Ben was a Were, he was not a Shifter, but a Weregopher, while Alex was a Weregerbil, the counterpoint to Amy's Goat-Nematode...For the love of Bob, if it takes 60 plus pages of exposition to ease into a really simplistic micro-plot, it's really not riveting reading. This thing was tedious beyond belief!"
3,Easy read,"I bought the Kindle version, and though it might be a formatting problem, there were a lot of grammatical errors. The book isn't the most interesting, and definitely has a lot of long inner dialogue paragraphs, but the story is so good! You just have to kind of push your way through the book sometimes."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this series,"I read this series before TrueBlood came into the picture, and I fell in love with the characters. I have read the series 3 times through, and enjoyed it each time! I am definately a Sookie fan!I think you have to enjoy supernatural books to enjoy the series, but if you are, these are a must read!"
3,Not Bad but not my Favorite,"I am at this point going to say this isn't my favorite book it might be my least favorite so far. There are parts of this book I did like, some I didn't. I really loved hearing more about Hadley and Queen Sophie Anne's relationship as well as we got to see in the past of Queen Sophie Anne and how she came to be a vampire.One part which brought tears to my eyes when the truth was revealed about Bill and Queen Sophie-Ann, poor Sookie. I was hoping some redemption came for Bill but it just seems to be highly unlikely now.Honestly as much as I like Quinn, I don't know if I really like him and Sookie together. Lastly I will say while parts I didn't care for I did love the battle at the end and Bill though I still am not sure about redeemed himself a bit in my eyes at the end(I did kind of feel sorry for him)."
4,Moving The Series On,"I enjoyed this book. It really moved the series further on. You find out more and more about Charlaine Harris' vampire world. I love the vampire politics and that's what this book is about. It's about seeing it through Sookie's eyes. It's not a stand alone book. You will need to read the past books in the series in order to understand all the hard feelings between Sookie and Bill and Sookie and Eric. This book brings Sookie further into the Louisiana vampire world and she gets to experience the political side of things. I loved the interactions between her and Quinn. It's sometimes hard to keep the vampires and the weres straight but it is getting easier. Sookie in this book travels to New Orleans so you aren't going to see much of Sam and Jason, but I would expect them to play a part in the next book in the series. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read the series and is looking for a quick and easy read. Great vacation book."
3,Did I miss something?,"As the title says did I miss something or what? Hadley, Sookie's cousin, dies BEFORE this book takes place, but AFTER the last one. But then the author refers to everything surronding her death like we have already read it.... WTH? Other than that I did enjoy this story and Sookie and Quinn's relationship, it sucks that once again she is moving too fast with a guy but if it wasn't for Eric and Bill still running around I could picture Sookie and Quinn lasting for a while."
3,Disappointing,This one was a little disappointing because there is a backstory in a collection of short stories so it was confusing without that book. I have the boxed set and when you buy a boxed set the story should flow uninterrupted. So that is the worst part of the book. Because of that this book took longer to read than the others I just kept feeling a disconnect from the story because of missing out on the backstory. There was some big secrets revealed in this book that will be interesting to see play out .But because of the whole backstory missing this was not my favorite of this series.If your reading this series I would recommend you find the book A Touch of Dead which should be Book 5 .My score is actually 2 1/2 Stars
3,Series Numbers are important,"Gah! I really like this series. After reading these from my local library I decided to purchase the Kindle editions. You know what's important when buying multiple titles from the same author for the same series? Knowing which number in the series the book is! I get it, True Blood is the tv series these books are based on, but when I'm trying to re-read them, it's more important for me to know that this is the 6th book and not the 7th, 8th or 9th. Come on!"
4,Too short!,This book left me wanting much more of the story line. It seemed so incomplete. I can only hope it's not building up to a letdown.
3,Not the best,"First, I need to completely agree with the review from David Cady regarding feeling ""lost"" half way through this book. I was on vacation and reading and night; I was convinced that perhaps I had accidentally skipped some chapters. Not the case at all. Come to find out here, there was a short story that explains some events that are central to this book. Not cool at all.Otherwise the story was basically bland. I'm reading the set to finish it, but I have to agree with many reviewers that have been disappointed with the quality of the story lines as the series goes on. Harris, you could do better work!"
3,I miss Bill--spoilers ahead!!,"Ok, I guess I'm in the minority here, but I like Bill. I've been hoping that Sookie and Bill would get back together, but after this book it's pretty clear that that's not happening. I do like Quinn, but not as much as Bill. As I said, I think I'm in the minority. As for the book it was ok. To me the first two were fabulous, but after that the series took a turn for the worse. Let's hope Sookie sticks with Quinn for more than a couple of pages."
4,Can't Get Enough,"I have enjoyed every single Sookie book. This is a series worth giving a chance. As for this particular story, I was rooting for Quinn and Sookie to get together. Because they wouldn't be considered a real couple by the end of the story, I think that they have a real chance at having a great relationship that will last. Sookie has been hurt very badly by the first ""vampire"" she loved and it has left her cautious of getting involved with someone else. I can only hope that Ms. Harris lets Sookie find her ""soulmate"" and hopefully it's Quinn.If you haven't read any of the Sookie books, you should start with ""Dead Until Dark"". If you like vampires, werewolves, humor and romance, you will be not be disapointed by this series."
2,"Better than the cheapest, but still sucky","Still sucking, but at least was a little more comfortable than I gave it credit for.I have to write extra words to = 20."
1,Cheap headphones made cheaply? For real?,"I've bought CD players that cost less than my total with shipping ($7.00) that have double the comfort of this product. Seriously, they don't really fit human heads too well, it makes me wonder what specifications they used when designing them.I had to double check the product page to make sure I hadn't accidentally bought a pair for manatees."
4,Not the right size.,"Shorts looked great and arrived on time. I thought they would fit my daughter, but they didn't. Returned item without issue."
4,GREAT Workout,"I bought the frontside and backside workout DVD and LOVE them. No it's not the most exciting workout, but it feels like you would as if you had her in the room with you. I don't like aerobic, high impact and fast paced stuff. This goes at a great pace, she explains what your form should be, how to do it the right way. I have only been doing it a couple of weeks and people are telling me they notice a difference and I take it with my Shotwave Slim weight loss drink. I recommend it to everyone!"
3,Feels too much like a workout,"This workout is HARD. It is good for someone who is very serious about toning up and building muscle, but for someone like me who wants to do some more basic toning it's not up to par. Visually, all you see is a white background, with Jillian coaching one of the Biggest Loser stars. She really works on form, but there's no music and it just feels painful and long. I think if you're really motivated this will be good for you, but if you need to have a little fun and not feel like you're counting every minute and every repetition, this is not for you."
3,Exercise dvd,What can you say about an exercise dvd? Either you exercise or you don't. Jillian Michaels is great at what she does.
2,"lack of variety, no music","I left feedback for her ""backside"" workout and same general comments apply although this one seems to have less of a variety. I got bored. Also, the fact that there's no even background music is disappointing and makes it even worse. Wouldn't buy this one."
3,Good excercises but too easy,"I rented this video because I love everything Jillian and I enjoy the challenge that I always get from her workouts. Not this one. I am an advanced excerciser but because it was Jillian I didn't really expect this to be a real ""begginer"" video. I found the quality of the video to be horrible. It is just Jillian and a contestant from the biggest loser doing 6 curcuits in an all white room, no music, no real enthusiasm. It was just blah. The workout itself delivered as Jillian usually does, it got me sweating but I added hand weights to all of the excercises and went a little faster than they did just to get more out of it. There is a transition break between each curcuit that in my opinion is way too long where she introduces the person with her. This is a real begginer workout so if you are just getting back into excercise I would reccomend this but by no means is this one of Jillian's kick butt workout."
3,Jillian Michaels for beginners - frontside,"I expected an easier workout, however, there are some exercises I have no problem with doing, just problems with the reps. I'm REALLY out of shape tho, so I'll have to work on it!"
3,A bit TOO easy,"Yes, I know that it clearly says that this is for beginners, but since most of the reviews said how hard this video was, I figured it would at least be somewhat challenging. After doing Jillian's other workout videos (30 day shred, no more trouble zones, etc..), this is way too easy. I was able to get through the whole workout with barely breaking a sweat."
2,Only for beginners,"It's not the quality of the exercises that is poor, but rather the quality of the video itself. The boring white background and beginner moves aren't for those who've mastered her other videos. Furthermore, as this is a re-release of her older videos, it's not as ""innovative"" as what we've become used to with her other videos. Sorry, Jillian, this one is not for me."
5,Quality is fantastic,"This is a fantastic cable that allows you to plug your MP3 player into your home stereo. You just plug in the headphone jack to your MP3 player, and then plug the other end into available RCA jacks on your home stereo. I have been using these for over a year to play my MP3's on my home stereo. If your sound output is not quite up to par, you might need to adjust the volume on the MP3 player to a high level and then reduce the volume on the stereo to eliminate distortion. There are also different lengths available, and I also have the 10 ft set, which provides a longer length so I can sit on the sofa and scroll through songs. These would work just as well for a portable CD player too if you don't have a home CD player on your stereo."
5,Quality cable,"This is a good quality cable for a fair price. It works as advertised. You can get better cables, and you can get cheaper cables, but this is a good mix of price and performance.Connectors attach securely.Sturdy jacket but highly flexible.Gold plated.Mine was black and gray opposed to the white in the photo at the time of purchase."
4,MP3 to JVC Surround Sound,"I purchased this cable to connect my MP3 to my JVC Surround Sound system. It has an Aux. input and works with this cable. The only problem is that you have to turn the sound on the JVC almost to max to get normal volume. The sound does not seem to be as good as I get from CDs of same song resolution. This not a fault of the cable, as the cable seems to be high quality."
3,Financial shenanigans - at Disneyland,"A fast-paced romp, from the author who also writes as AM Kabal and HS Bhabra (his real name)."
5,cowboy-reach for the sky,"cowboy was a peffect melding of early 70's grateful dead with allman bros band. Not only is this cd in my all time top 100 (at 55, i've listened to over 20,000 pieces of music), but i don't particularly care about the music of the allmans or the dead. That should tell you why this is so much better than the sum of its influences. Cowboy is truly transcendant, and well worth the high bucks to purchase."
1,Don't do it!!!!,"I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life, and i've seen a bunch.The story is poor, the acting is poor, the directing is poor. I'm not even going to try and sell my copy because i can not be responsible for inflicting this amount of pain on another person.Do yourself a favor, watch something else."
1,One star for the picture quality,"The sound is poor, the story is poor, the dialogue is poor. I bought the disc for Arielle Kebble. She's in less than 5% of it."
5,hilarious,"If this book doen't make you laugh, check your pulse...you're probably dead. This is no surprise to those of us familiar with Mr. Pogue's own books. Anything he writes is hilarious, informative & great. Naturally, anything he edits is great. I have planned to give this little jewel with every holiday gift. Eileen Siralewker@aol.com"
3,An OK Compilation of Material on the Web.,"David has done a good job of compiling material here, but most of what you'll read you'll get the feeling you've read before...and you probably have.The book is fun and funny and worth getting as a late night read or a bathroom book to read in your off-minutes away from a computer."
3,The Hilarious Side of Human Nature,"One of my companies specializes in tech support. But none of the people we have operating in these positions ever tells any stories of their experiences. That's because they're all bound by the customer to not tell anything.If the stories in this book are anything like their jobs, they must get a good laugh now and then. This book shows the funny side of human nature, how people respond when trying to figure out how to work with technology. This is the type of book to keep around and read a couple stories here and there for the humor."
5,The Best of its Kind,"If you want a small, compact collection of fantastic harp music played to perfection, you don't need to go further than this album. There are some well-known pieces, such as Mozart's concerto for flute and harp and Ravel's Introduction and Allegro, as well as music by Handel and Debussy. Two lesser-known treasures, however, are Dittersdorf's Harp Concerto and the Concerto-Serenade by Rodrigo. As you can guess from these allusions, the two discs include music both of the 18th Century and the 20th. Nicanor Zabeleta displays his talents well as soloist, and Paul Kuentz and his chamber orchestra perform exquisitely. Highly recommended."
1,"A good idea, but...","This book _seemed_ like a good idea. I travel a great deal with my beagle and wanted something that would help identify places to go with him. However, this book is basically worthless. I did not learn anything new, or that I could not have picked up elsewhere in a more comprehensive form. I also checked some places where I specifically know you can (or cannot) take dogs and found the information to be wrong. The presentation was also amateurish, with quite a few typos. This lack of effort in compiling the information, plus lack of concern for the final presentation, makes it very apparent that I do not want this for my bookshelf."
2,Inconvenient device,A cumbersome tool that did not fit the mattress well. A floor stand with pulleys was hard to find but proved far more stable.
2,bait and switch,"My husband was very disappointed with this item. The photo of the package shows that the vise grips were made in USA, but the ones he received are not. The quality is nothing like the one that were once made in the USA. It seems USA made vise grips are impossible to get anymore. He thought he found some of the last remaining ones. These are loose at the connection which prevents a good hold on an object. They are not worth the price."
2,Disappointing,"Although you get 3 CD's, this is overall a lackluster package. The mixing is decent but uninspired and, worse, the tracks are all strictly average and way, way too similar. The first 21st Century Drum+Bass comp, mixed by Decoder, is amazing but this one falls way short."
5,A fresh approach,"I bought this book after reading Joseph's French Wines. This one is very different - more of an encyclopedia - but it has the same forthright opinions and the same down-to-earth approach. I'd compare it to the Hugh Johnson Pocket Encyclopedia, but it's easier to use and offers more in its introductory sections. I plan to buy several copies as gifts for friends who want to learn more about wine."
4,A pearl in the rough,"This cd brings back wonderful memories of the by-gone era of album rock radio. Black Pearl is a wonderful mix of great songwriting, rock, blues, and some synths. The hit off of this album was I La La La Love You, but the standout song is Who'll Take The Fall - a masterpiece.The vinyl transfer doesn't bother me as much as others who have posted here. It's not as bad as other transfers I have heard; actually, it is one of the better ones.Pat Travers is the master of down in the dumps hard rock'n'blues. Many thanks to Lemon Recordings for re-releasing Pat Travers' classic albums."
2,In a word......synthesizers,"And to me that's a bad thing. I don't know why otherwise good artists resort to these machines to create or ""enhance"" their music. It gives the songs a definite radio-friendly sound, which is what they're going for, I guess. Too many bands/artists have given way to these abominable inventions (Van Halen, Rush, Styx, Sabbath, The Who, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and so on)."
3,Was Ok,"Was bored one evening, decided to watch a horror film, so I rented this movie. A bit dissapointed, barely any scares, some parts just seemed ridiculously funny to me, like really. Pretty much felt like I wasted my money, dropped $8 to rent while still in theaters. Price was a little high in my opinion. I'm not paying to rent another horror movie again, I'll just wait until available on netflix."
1,If you're into pointless gore and endless breasts,"Probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. If someone would have warned me about the ""Blair Witch Project"" filming and horrible story lines, I may have not wasted those 2 hours.Honestly, it's a movie primarily about over-sexualized guys - who are all pigs - breasts flashing ever 10 minutes, pointless gore, and absolutely no hope for anyone, let alone the so called ""heroes"" of the films.Disgustingly stupid."
2,Disappointing,"Most of the stories contained on this anthology go nowhere leading to relief when the end credits finally roll. Given the ""touted"" directorial talent involved I was surprised at how amateurish the whole production felt."
3,it was alright...,"For the most part I don't think that this movie was all that scary, I did like the unknown factor, because you didn't know what was going to happen next... however when something did happen it was anticlimactic. Could have been a lot better."
2,"Best Trailer Ever, but 13 yo boys filmed it. :(","After seeing the amazing trailer for this, I was hyped to see it. It looked like it would be the freakiest, scariest film ever. Unfortunately, I soon discovered it was a mess. The first and last films were pretty decent, though I could've done without the nudity in the first one (it was skating a fine line between horror and porn, mostly on the porn side). You don't need to show tits to make a horror movie, really, you don't. The one about the Skype convos was OK, it had some freaky parts, and a unique way of presenting the story. The 2nd honeymoon was a waste of film and time - completely worthless. The one in the woods was likewise worth skipping. The last film was pretty freaky though, and interesting. This could've been so much more with better filmmakers. Disappointing."
4,VHS review,"VHS is a very different,but very creepy kind of horror movie.Can't say much about thee plot because it would spoil the fun but it contains five separate stories and also centers around a goup of criminals that find the VHS tapes containing these stories.There will probably be at least one story out of the group that people won't like,but you're bound to enjoy the majority of them. Must see for horror movie fans or fans of the Anthology type of movie."
2,Yawn,The movie was very incoherent and lacked focus. The collection of videos that make up the majority of the movie may offer a few gasps and screams but are ultimately overly predictable. The overarching story didn't make any sense at all. I would pass on this one.
2,Awful,"I kept hearing about how scary this movie was so I couldn't wait to see it. Im a huge horror movie fan! I paid ten bucks and I wish I didn't! It's cheesy but not in a good way. Some of the 'videos' were completely pointless. Some of the others had awful acting. I know it's an indie film and all, but not all of them are this bad. I'm wondering why it got so high of reviews on rotten tomatoes. The first story wasn't so bad so I had hope but after the other found videos...I almost just turned it off. The faux glitchy 'static' got really annoying too! I would not watch this again...ever. Maybe if you really waNt to watch it I would look for it for free...it's that bad."
2,rewind the tape!,"I give this movie ""2 TAPES DOWN""...**DID YOU REALLY GET SCARED?**(I also believe some people will get scared by this movie...it has VERY elaborate death scenarios and camera tricks to control the viewers focal point).ummm...what else?...oh, I'm sure this was how BLAIR WITCH 2 was suppose to look, but fell short of that.""horror"" movies don't scare me anymore...but if one ever did, I'm sure it would scare the living daylights out of an ordinary citizen....."
2,Awful,I was really looking foward to see this and was so upset with it. Half of it is completely boring and the other half is so shaky you can barely tell what's going on. Not worth ten bucks!
1,"If ""found footage"" horror isn't dead, this should kill it.","Several douchebags who videotape themselves committing vandalism and assaults on women are hired to retrieve a videotape from a house. The entire film is presented as if on low quality VHS with the camera being pointed at a bright light every 10 seconds to blind the viewer. The camera work is haphazard, more shaky than ""shaky cam."" Not only does one have no investment in the characters (who are two-dimensional scum), but the film itself is punishment to the eyes. Stay away. Stay far away."
2,Good but not Great,"I was so excited for this film based on the preview I saw. By the time the film was done I was slightly disappointed with it all however. It is cool that there are multiple different horror stories fit into this one movie and some of them are good while others just seem like fillers. They are all different and not linked but the main story that runs throughout the film is ridiculous. A group of guys break into a house to steal a video tape and in between each video they watch one of them disappears, lame! Overall, it was fun just not the amazing film I wanted."
2,A major let down.,"I went into this with such high hopes as I had read all the positive reviews online. It seems like an updated version of Creepshow or Tales from the Crypt. It has an overarching story line of some guys trying to make money by stealing a vhs tape from some old man. Upon entering the house they start watching the tapes to find the one they are after so it leads into 5 mini films. Only 2 of these are any good. The problem is whereas creepshow the stories actually had a full story. With these you fill like you only catch parts and there is no conclusion. Your just left going ""What? Why? That doesn't make sense.""At $1.99 I could have let this go as an average horror movie. But at the 9.99 they want you to pay its overpriced and not worth it at all.If you wish to see this just go rent the Creepshow movies. Much better and much cheaper."
2,I've Seen Better,"There were some interesting moments, but overall this movie just did not cut it for me. It was another one of the ""found footage"" type films, which I generally like. This one was sort of like several short stories that came together in the end, but not in a very satisfying way. It took me several viewings to get all the way through because I kept getting bored (I would watch one of the short stories then stop). There was some gore, and as I said some decent moments, but overall it did not work. If you like the ""found footage"" type movie, you may like it...but I didn't."
2,does not live up to the hype,bad storyline and horrible ending. dont waste your time on this movie you will wish you can have your ninety minutes back you wasted on this movie
4,Pretty Good!,"I actually thought this movie was pretty good! If you love the type of movies where they show 5 different short stories, you might dig this one. It kind of reminded me of ""Tales From The Darkside"" or ""Tales From The Crypt."" (for those who remember those shows.) Although I must say I found myself LAUGHING more than jumping out of fear. For me, the scare factor wasn't there. I would say that was the only thing it lacked. At least in my opinion. Overall, it was pretty good and worth checking out."
5,"Scary, inventive fun!","All I am going to say is that for every 40 or 50 horror movies that come and go without so much as a thought, luckily for us fans, someone makes something creative like this. A well written, directed and acted horror anthology. I am happy when I see things in a film I've never seen before. Well done."
3,meh,"Maybe i've seen too many b horror movies, and b ""handy cam"" movies but good lord this movie was a dud. Production was terrific, but acting and story telling was dull. Lots of ""t&a"" but very very very little thrills or scares."
2,Mildly (15%) entertaining,"Poor plot, that almost seemed like it was getting somewhere...but then it never did. Flat C movie. If you like to passively watch movies that lack depth and are looking for blood, guts, and nudity, this might be your movie. Otherwise, don't waste your time.Warning: the amount of senseless violence against women and sexually predatory behavior from bro-tastic 20 to early 30 year old men is disgusting."
2,Garbage,"Was a great attempt at a scary movie but was a bit too jumpy. Only one character in the whole movie actually made sense and was only semi freaky. Need to bring back old style horror and ditch the ""Blair Witch"" style."
3,Watchable,I have to admit I was truly frighten watching some parts of this movie such as Amateur Night. I had to stop watching and finish the remainder of the movie during the day.
1,Took A Chance...It Didn't Work For Me.,"Sorry, I was really hoping this movie would exceed expectations.The reviews are all over the place so I figured it may be one of the decent movies that might just be too disturbing for some.Honestly...it was really a lot worse that I thought it would be. Jerky camera, predictable stories, no real scares.Luckily, it was free on Amazon Prime...but I didn't even think it was worth watching for nothing.I almost paid Amazon rental price of $9.99 when it first came out. Thank God I didn't.If you like low-budget horror...I would recommend looking around before settling on this clunker."
2,Not terribly clever.,"If you're a connoisseur of horror films, skip this one. It's true, the stories within the story are slightly more interesting than the typical horror trope, but none of the stories make any sense or offer any real suspense or scares. No explanation is ever given for any of the stories individually or the overarching plot - in fact, I'd say the film makers seem to be taking advantage of the format of telling lots of short stories to keep from having to write motive for any of them.I wouldn't pay to rent it. If you want to watch it, grab it when it's on Netflix or borrow it from a friend. But all in all, if you're the kind of person who's seen all the horror classics and looking for something new, interesting, and well done, this will likely leave you wishing you'd skipped it."
2,Pretty Lame,"Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie but it was hyped up a lot.I was thinking it was gonna be really scary. I usually like anthology movies but this was just lame.It's was like watching something like the Blair Witch Projects but as an anthology.This gang of guys who film stupid videos to sell online are hired to steal a VHS tape from a house.One of them ends up watching all these random tapes he finds and each of those shows its own horror story.Most of the stories were kind of lame and reminded at best of some of the crappier episodes of Freddy's Nightmares, as far as acting and writing went. Just a lot more low budget than that show was obviously.There is one story with a killer in the woods who kind of reminds me of Jason. There are some creepy parts there but overall this movie was just really slow and boring.The framing device, with that gang of guys, was shitty as hell. I hated watching those parts and the actors were annoying."
3,"Interesting, but inherently flawed.","Firstly, why is there a modern movie about VHS tapes that literally could have been done using DVD or digital concepts so it wouldn't seem so trivial and stupid of an oversight. Anyhow, this movie contains a number of different vignettes, some of which actually bring a new sense of eeriness that may be worth watching if you're bored of the same old schlock. Ultimately, this is a good attempt by a lot of guys who really took the TNA policy of the horror genre a little too seriously. Honestly, sometimes it's better to not flash busty tits at the audience while simultaneously trying to terrify them; it's sensorially confusing (and that's coming from a gay man)."
1,Horrible horror,"Horror ???? more like Horrible! all the hype about the ""scariest movie ever or of our time"" nonsense! this was a knockoff of Blairwitch or Cloverfield- the only difference is there were about 5 different stories each as moronic and campy as the last.Plus a ton of guys acting like fools, and a ton of unnecessary bad language and crappy filming.I'm not sure if the director was trying to throw off the audience to make it look like true happenings -I was just bored. The only reason I watched it in it's entirety was because I paid for it.Thank goodness I didn't pay for it at the theatre"
1,very bad,dont waste your time.....stupiddumbest movie ever.....I wish I could back the hour and a half that I wasted on this.
3,what did i watch?,ok lets get this out of the way V/H/S was not a good movie but not a bad movie with it being the story(s) the character(s)the badness in it all i can say is that this was a good/bad one
3,Terrified My Wife,"This movie had it's moments...Sometimes a little confusing and hard to follow, but enjoyable. Kind of a modern day ""takes From the Crypt"". My wife got so scared, she left the room."
3,VHS,I liked this movie and the different video clips. The movie lacks explanation as to why these guys are looking for a specific VHS which left me asking where's the rest of the movie. Other than that it was a good movie
3,"I like it , I just wish there was more there","Really liked the little great things about it, but the cliffhanger endings make this movie a 1 time view . My suggestion ? If you want to see an entertaining movie that isn't that impressive , but still fun to watch yeah watch V/H/S/ if you wan tto watch a good movie.......no this one"
4,Scary and Original,Would have to admit that this movie was brutal and original. Things that I've never seen in a horror movie before. It was a good collection but not great. So if they were gonna tackle a sequel this is a good starting point.
3,not scary,With what it said about the movie i expected to be scared. But wasnt but was pretty funny liked the vampire lady
1,Miss this one,I am a wimp when it comes to horror films. I just want to put this out there first. THIS MOVIE IS NOT SCARY. I did not jump. I did not feel afraid. I was able to go pee in the dark.
1,Worst then my mother in law food!,"If you want to get dizzy this is the movie for you, other wise don't waste your precious time, believe me, god knows that it doesn't take too much to entertain me but this was damn bad! After this i felt nausea's, about the camera shaking and moving like a freaking blender! any ways is up to you but don't say I didn't warn you."
1,Horror-ble Movie!,"Keeping it short and to the point, this movie was a letdown. Not only was I not scared (although the first story had great potential), but this movie seemed to play to the 'Paranormal' and gore crowd. Weak story throughout and that constant shaky camera was most annoying. Glad I watched it before deciding whether or not to purchase it!"
1,Just bad,"Too much money for a non eventful horror movie. But, they my extra money charged. To be hyped the way it was.... Just a rip off"
1,Two thumbs......Down,"Very low budget looking movie. Straight to DVD, now we know why. If you're looking for gross out scare tactics then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
3,V/H/S,"I thought this started off slow as most of these 'found footage' type films do. If you like Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch Project, Chronicle, Cloverfield, Troll Hunter then you might enjoy this. Plenty of gore and nudity. Some characters I found annoying. There is a sequel apparently being made."
3,"Style over substance, but it has its merits.","Although the ""found footage"" genre is probably played out at this point, this film does have a somewhat different take on the idea, at least initially. The various segments aren't always as fully fleshed out (pardon the pun) as they could be, and much of the writing is substandard, but there are some arresting visuals and some genuinely disturbing images. Not bad for a rental."
3,I LIKE YOU,"For those who love shaky fake found footage, this one is da bomb. A group of criminals film their escapades of vandalism and assaults to sell to a buyer. They then enter a house to get a VHS tape, they will know it when they see it. The rest of the movie shows us found footage film within a found footage film. Oh joy. There is a dead man in the house sitting in front of a series of TVs. Each hooligan watches a film segment, then disappears from the movie. The film segments are not connected, i.e. there is no real common theme other than it is more snuff than horror with a different type of monster/entity in each piece.The final installment, I thought had the best special effects, but with the jerky camera motion and people screaming makes it difficult to enjoy any of it.Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, and plenty of nudity, including full frontal (Hannah Fierman)."
4,"Come on, not so bad","What works is the short story format: more tension, quicker pay off, less repetition. Sure, some of the stories work better than others, and the connecting segments are garbage, but it was enjoyable horror. A great rental for prime members."
3,A summary of stories.,"This is a compilation of scary stories within a scary story. The main story line is lame, but the first video that the characters watch is awesome! The rest of them are too predictable and lame. I still haven't finished it yet, I only had 10 minutes left to go, but I ended up falling asleep."
2,A waste of time.,"I love horror movies, and I love anthologies, AND I even love found-footage stuff. Sadly, this is pretty lame.For one thing, it's possible to do horror without having the entire cast of characters be un-relateable douches. Not here, though. Everyone is grating, obnoxious, and obtusely stupid. The first story is so full of screaming and shaking the camera that it's nearly unwatchable. The wraparound story is likewise bad (and it's a cast of douches).Sure, it's somewhat inventive, but you're better off going to watch an hour and a half of amateur stuff on YouTube (there will be less camera shaking and OMG-I-HAVE-A-CAMERA LET ME ZOOM IN ON EVERYTHING idiocy).Pass."
2,Poor man's Masters of Horror collection,"This movie had some moderately okay shorts in it, however I would not consider this a must watch or even an ""I'm bored"" watch. I got fed up with it about halfway through. The acting is terrible and they treat every camera as though it is a VHS camera; they aren't. Surely this movie is for some, but I was not satisfied. I'd save this movie for the day that you are legitimately running out of other movies to watch on Prime."
3,Good,This was a good movie I wish some stories were longer than others. Some were a little lame. Overall I thought the first story was the best.
4,Decent,"It's really tough to find a good horror flick out there but this one meets the standard better than most. The stories are far more interesting than the average vampire or crazed murderer horror and the variance in topics allows the stories to develop and end quickly without dragging long enough to bore the viewer (pun intended). For most viewers, this movie will be good enough to see on the big screen but, if you seek more than cheap thrills in the horror district, you'll probably want to wait to see this on DVD or even Blu-ray format instead."
2,V H S Movie experience simulator,"This will depend on your alcohol tolerance, so adjust from the base line (up) if you are a drunk. First, if you are a non to light drinker, drink one-half of a fifth of some cheap whiskey. Wait 30 minutes. Now, stand up and spin around in a circle 40 times. Without taking a break, drive to Wallmart and run up and down the isles. That is what you feel like if you watch this disorienting movie. You should also remember that VHS video looks like crap nowadays, so don't expect too much from that aspect either. Don't pay $10 to see this early, if you feel like you have to see it, wait till its about $1.99 to rent so you won't feel robbed when you turn it off after 30 minutes."
1,Abysmal,I rented this because Ti West was involved and I have loved his films thusfar. House of The Devil and Innkeepers especially. His short film in this about the people on their honeymoon was actually pretty solid. The remainder of them were straight up craptastic. I paid $8 to rent this because I was so excited to see it months before it came out. I actually turned it off before finishing it. I would not even be willing to rewatch this for $0. My friend bought it (he is bummed by the mistake) so I ended up finishing it a couple of months later thinking that maybe I was just in a bad mood or something...nope...hated it!
2,not scary,"Movie was all over the place. Didn't like the production like they did on the ""Paranormal"" movies. If you like that documentary/reality type movies then this might be for you. Overall I am disappointed."
2,All over the place,"I like the anthology concept but I think the ""main"" segment really put me off and I wanted to turn it off in the 1st 5minutes. I soldiered through and it felt like this movie was 10hrs long. Some of the stories are good, but overall it was a pain to watch."
1,It was very bad!,I gave it 1 star because there were no negative stars. It's like Blair Witch Project meets a bunch of filthy mouthed retards with no continuity and no idea what they are doing.............
1,Worst movie ever,"I'm not sure that I would even call this a movie, more like a collection of self shot shorts that have only one thing in common, people get killed in some random way. At no point was I frightened, intrigued, or even slightly stimulated. I would not have finished the movie if I was not watching it on my tablet on a plane. My advice is to avoid this movie."
1,Complete waste of time and money,"This movie had absolutely no plot, just a lot of random stuff. Considering all of the nudity, violence, and gore, it was just really boring. I paid $9.99 to watch it on demand because I had heard how scary it was, but it was like a bunch of dudes got super stoned and decided to make a movie, and then forgot what they were supposed to be doing five minutes in. Seriously sucked so hard. Only in America can you make such shit and get rich off of it. Well, I guess China too."
5,"aahhh, some fresh air finally.","did you enjoy the days where horror wasnt just some cookie cutter pg-13 ""the ring"" ripoff? are you tired of the same october lull of ""paranormal activity"" and other child friendly ""horror movies"". then V/H/S is for you. you may not be completely won over by every story but the fact that it tries to do something new(and with gusto i might add) is well enough for me to recommend this movie to anyone who wants more out of their horror films. check out ""the innkeepers"", ""House of the devil"", and the ""Signal"" if you want some more creative horror movies that are better than your norm scary flick.i rented this on my ps3 aug 31. and we watched it twice before the rental timer went off. loved every single second. MORE TI WEST PLEASE!!!!!!!!"
1,"A truly awful movie. Excellent advertising, though! Fooled me!","A truly awful movie. Excellent advertising campaign, though! Fooled me! I can only assume they are depending on the advertising campaign and the absurd suggestion that it is so scary that people might pass out(!) to make as much money as they can as quickly as they can, before word of mouth tanks the movie. Believe me, this movie isn't worth seeing for FREE. It's too late for me, but you can still save yourself!!"
5,Skip around absob some images ull enjoy,Skip around no need to nulify If you sea it when you should there isnt no problem seeing it when its right felt like a kind of sleeping visual to me entertwine urself between bs urself
1,Suck,Ok what the hell 25.00 for a vhs tape of v/h/s now that worthless hell i can make my own copy on vhs if wanted
4,Very Creepy Indeed,"I am constantly on the hunt for truly scary movies. Not bloody or gory necessarily, but scary. This movie fit the bill. So, if you want a creepy movie, I would recommend V/H/S."
5,Paranormal Activity + Creepshow = V/H/S,"The scariest movie I've seen in a while. Clearly low budget and the acting isn't oscar worthy, but it really didn't need to be in order to scare the poop out of me.The movie is made of several shorter stories that kind of tie into the underlying plot. But each short story had it's own plot that could have easily been turned into its own movie... they were all that good. Many with a pretty good twist.I have pretty thick skin. I enjoy scary movies but rarely do they scare me and few have ever haunted me quite like this one. Hopefully the sequel will be as strong."
4,Unique and scary,"A less than awesome ending kept me from giving it five stars. I love horror moves, and there aren't many good ones. This is one of them. Disturbing and unpredictable."
3,"After I threw up, I felt better","Okay, I have to admit that watching the Blair Witch in the theater back in the day, I vomited in the parking lot. V/H/S seemed to have the same impact on my tummy. Perhaps the shakey camera work is just too much for me.As an anthology of more modern pov horror, this is okay. Horror is at its best when it wraps up moral teaching in a fear burrito, imho. This kinda wandered around and around, again upsetting my stomach.I'd still give this three stars for holding my interest, but again not enough for me to fear."
5,Awesome compilation horror movie.,This movie was worth every penny I spent on it. I watched it twice within the 24 hour time limit. Highly recommended.
2,"Cool concept, poorly executed.","I like found-footage movies, but this one was just a chore to watch. The improv nature of the dialogue makes following the characters nearly impossible because they step on each others lines and I can't understand them. The films themselves range from slightly creepy to pointless. None of them have satisfying endings and feel like they're just getting started. Severe disappointment."
1,"No Story, Unwatchable","We only made it through the first 2 ""short films"" but the movie just sucked. All the characters I saw were hyper-aggressive douche bags that deserved to die. The jerky footage was nauseating and poorly done. All in all a really bad movie and a huge waste of money."
1,"Just terrible, run away from this ""movie""","I don't write nearly as many reviews on Amazon as I should, but 5 minutes after watching this I had to warn people. IT SUCKED! Thankfully it was free on HDNET and I ended up fast forwarding after the first 20 minutes of idiocy. I can't believe that anyone thought this movie was a good idea, there is no suspense, it's all telegraphed. The story is horribly boring. I wouldn't even recommend watching this if it was free, what a waste of time."
1,Terrible,"Very poor, Not suspenseful simply gory. none of the stories connect with the overarching story, all but one of the stories are uninteresting"
1,Oh well,"Over hyped junk for the most part as usual. I'v seen better on YouTube for free although I did like the tale ""Tuesday the 17th"". Heading out for some Advil to cure my headache."
1,C/R/U/D,"An awful attempt at the tired ""found footage"" genre. Non-interlocking stories are enveloped by some mish-mash about kids breaking into a house to steal a VHS tape. Lots of unanswered questions, not for the sake of mystery, but because the filmmakers aren't really sure what's going on either. Juvenile and lacking in suspense, this was a waste of my $10.00. What theater is going to show this?"
3,No the best,It was ok. I was excited to see this movie and was a bit let down. Don't know what else to say.
2,Not worth more than a few pages,"I had just finished the book ""Titan Unveiled: Saturn's Mysterious Moon Explored"" and really really appreciated its content, quality, and the author's style. So I went for another book about a gas-giant moon - and ended up with Unmasking Europa.Clearly, the author is carrying around some huge emotional baggage and it comes out literally on every single page. The science is buried in the defensive attitude.I could not complete this short book - it was too saturated with the author's dissatisfaction with other scientists and the space community. Disappointed."
4,Great historical fiction for 3rd-6th graders!,"Brady tells the story of a 19th century Pennsylvania boy whose family is divided on the issue of slavery. Brady is unsure as to what he believes. Brady learns a lot about life as this coming of age story progresses-- central themes include: slavery (many facets), relationship with his father, learning not to say too much, friendships. Excellent read for mid to late elementary! Nothing too intense or inappropriate but thought provoking."
4,Jean Fritz combines history with lessons for life.,"I gave Brady four stars because it starts out a little slow, and for that reason it might be hard for kids to see it through. But it is worth the effort. I like how Fritz comments on character as she shows the different attitudes about slavery before the Civil War. The end is exciting. Brady conquers his own character flaws, and learns to live for something beyond himself."
4,"""Brady"" is older than you think!","I'm glad to see this book is well-received. I remember ordering it from Scholastic's classroom paperback sales program as a middle schooler, back in the late 1960s. I'm curious: why the 2001 publication date? More accurately, that's a reissue date. I'm glad to see ""Brady"" is still around and still being enjoyed, because it made a strong impression on me about 40 years ago. But I wonder if books, along with starlets, now have to lie about their age to gain acceptance and attention."
1,Brady is very difficult,"Brady is a bad book. I'm thirteen, and I read Brady. It was a very difficult book. The plot was way off from the story. I read the back cover, and then I read the book. They were two totally seperate things. Don't read Brady. You'll just be wasting you're money and time."
4,"Terrific Music, Not a Great Value","The Emerson String Quartet is one of the most successful andpopular chamber groups of the 90s. While this recording may notreceive as much critical acclaim as their Bartok, Schubert or Shostakovich recordings, these Mozart ""Haydn"" Quartets are played dynamically. My only reason for not awarding a fifth star has nothing to do with the content of the music, but instead with the value of this purchase. Many prospective buyers may want to opt for the Julliard String Quartet's 3CD ""Haydn"" Quartet performance. With this CD you get two pieces, whereas with the Julliard you get 6. However, with either choice you are getting terrific music."
4,"Good for those who don't want the full seasons 1, & 2.","This DVD features episodes from seasons 1 & 2. This collection was originally marketed only as a part of the Universal Alfred Hitchcock Signature Movie Collections, and not available seperately.REVENGE (season 1) 10/2/55 (series premier)- also on the season 1 set.BREAKDOWN (season 1) 11/13/55 - also on the season 1 set.WET SATURDAY (season 2) 9/30/56 - also on the season 2 set.MR. BLANCHARD'S SECRET (season 2) - also on the season 2 set.I would strongly suggest buying the seasonal sets if you are a fan:Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season OneAlfred Hitchcock Presents - Season TwoAlfred Hitchcock Presents - Season Three"
3,"Well, If You Like Hitchcock, You Gotta Have It...","Well, OK, the Master did sell himself. He liked money and the things it could buy, so he lent his name and image to this fairly so-so TV series.As you consider buying this anthology DVD set, then, look at it as getting Hitch by the pound. For the money, you get hours of stuff you can watch while ironing or running your washing machine. And, whenever Alfred himself takes the stage, you can count on some funny business and great, droll props.Only one or two of these episodes, though, bear his personal mark.So, consider buying it by the pound. The quality of the restorations is great, and it looks mighty fine on your video shelf.Besides, don't you have some ironing to do?"
5,"Exceptional, our children were absolutely captivated",The presentation of audio literature is superb. We went scurrying to purchase more volumes and have been disappointed at the difficulty in obtaining the BBC versions. Our children are constantly reminding us to get more for car rides and nite-time listening.
3,The Horse and His Boy,"I would recommend not only this book but the whole Narnia series, to anyone who has seen the movie The lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. These books go into so much more detail, and expand on the plot more than any movie can, thanks to the swift writing of C.S. Lewis. The Horse and His Boy is a somewhat easy to read fantasy in which the reader can be drawn into a couple of different stories at once and experience different living styles, such as princesses and slaves. As each of the stories join, the diverse characters form a small group facing a big challenge where adventure and being able to trust the future play two important roles. This book should be suggested to anyone looking for a good read that puts clear pictures of deserts, mountains, kings, queens, wars, and even talking horses into your mind. It's hard to believe but The Horse and His Boy, even though it is a fantasy, is easy to relate to everyday life and still brings you into a completely different world."
4,"Fantasy, excitment [at most times].",Really good. The second Narnian book was better. The exciting scenes were more exceting then other books but the there came a long period of boredom.
5,The Horse and His Boy is a great book,I've personally read all but the last two of the series and The Horse and his Boy has to be one of the best. A boy from Calormen is sold as a slave. He escapes to go across the Calormenian desert. A horse accompanies him and gives him advice. He arrives in Narnia to find he is a prince in that world.
1,it was a mistake,i didn't want to buy this book. i need books in SpanishMy daughter doesn't speak Englishto buy this book was a mistake
3,a talking horse!,"In my opinon this book was sort of plain. There isn't any magic of humor in it at all. If there isn't anything to read you should read this, but if you have another book to read i suggust you read the other book first. The only reson that I read this bok was because it was because it was an assingment for school. Don't waset your time on this book, it sinks."
4,A Great Sequeal,The Horse and his Boy is a great sequal to the Lion the witch and the Wardrobe. It's exciting and a great book to inspire you to reach your dreams. It's a great action and wonderful suspense book making you never want to put it down. I would reccomend this book for anyone who has a dream but doesn't think it's possible. Though I believe you should read the first two in this series before you go onto this.
3,Not as good as I remember from childhood,"I thought this book was great fun (and had no inkling of any religious messages) when I read it as a child. When I re-read it as an adult, however, it was another story. Although this time I was not only aware of but actively looking for religious themes--not that they're in any way hidden--the story was still moderately enjoyable.The writing, on the other hand, was painful. Its simplicity made me have to fight to keep reading and (although I know it would horrify C.S. Lewis) long to be reading Harry Potter instead, or at least wish that Lewis had taken a page from Rowling's book and made his Narnia series also readable for adults. As it is, I'd rather watch film adaptations than slog through the simplistic writing that for some reason takes me even longer to read than complex prose."
3,Mystery and Magical,"I think that this book is a wonderful thing to read if you like wondering what will happen next. A boy named Shasta runs away from Areesh, an old fisherman, to find his real father and be free. This book taught me that anything can happen if you trust in God and belive in yourself. It was written by C.S.Lewis, a Christian author. There are seven books in the whole series, so try reading this book; I'm sure you'll like it."
3,"Good, but not enough actual Narnia","The horse and his boy is a good book, so instead of saying it is the worst in the series, I will say that it is the 7th best.This novel has a young boy knowen as Shasta, who works for his father, Arsheesh. But when he finds out he came from the north mountains and that he is not Arsheesh's son, him and a talking horse who says it's name is Bree. They together run into wild and magical obsticles, places, and people along their quest for ""Narnia and the North.""I personally think this book is okay to good. 3.5/5 7.75/10 B"
4,The Horse and His Boy,"It is a good, quick read that does not require knowledge of the other books in the series.Quick readDoes not require knowledge of previous books"
1,The Horse and His Boy and My Good Nap,"In the book, The Horse and His Boy, Book 3 in The Chronicles of Narnia, by C.S. Lewis, I was very disappointed. I really enjoyed Book 1 and Book 2. They were both packed with lots of action and suspense. The adventures of the main character, Shasta, were not at all intriguing. Eventhough in his past two novels, C.S. Lewis made me root for the heroes and had me so involved with the stroy I actually felt I was there in Narnia, this time he missed his mark. Shasta is trying to find out who he is. He travels to Narnia. Once in Narnia I thought the stroy would pick up and entertain me, unfortunately it did not. The only reason why I actually finished the book instead of abandoning it was the hope the story would improve. I would only recommend this book to people with weak hearts, this way they would be in no danger of suffering a heart attack from the excitement."
2,Disappointing...,"I love audio CD's and I love CS Lewis so I really wanted this dramatization to be fabulous. I was sorely disappointed. Apart from Paul Scofield who plays the narrator, the other characters were flat and 'reading', especially the boy who played Shasta. My advice is to pass on this one."
2,Dull,This book is not near as exciting as the 2 before it in the series. I think I almost fell asleep reading some parts. It did have a pinch of spice to it. I wouldn't recommend it though.
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Talking horses, plural. Not a single one of them named Ed that I recall, either. That is a pity, as it would have made this book eminently more readable than the pretty lame tale contained here.This is an overextended fairy tale with the odd Greek mythological reference or two thrown in. Generally not very good."
1,Gorgeous,"This story is probably my favorite from the whole series and Focus on the Family does it full justice and then some. From the squalor of Shasta's house to the plush luxury of the palaces of Tashbaan to the blinding desert to the beautiful sparkling land of Narnia this dramatization brings it all alive, and contrary to another reviewer, I do not think it presents a false or pernicious view of Islamic peoples (on the contrary, based on a reference from ""The Last Battle"" Lewis must have been much more tolerant than many people I know). The Tashbaan settings and people do give an impression of Oriental lushness in a colorful way and one must remember that this is a purely imaginary realm.The acting is superb (notably by the horses and the two children and the ""real"" prince-listen for his voice as Digory in ""The Magician's Nephew""), and the sound and music are perfect. I highly recommend this as well as the rest of the series. Bravo Focus!"
5,Amazing Books,"No one can capture the heart of children and adults alike quite the way C.S. Lewis did with the Chronicles of Narnia. The movies that have been are great, no doubt, but nothing compares to the actual books. The Horse and His Boy is the least popular in the series and I think I understand why, it's centered around fewer characters with a simply goal (though this changes further into the story). Still, it's one of my personal favorites. It's to read and 'see' the friendship build and strengthen between the four main characters."
4,The Horse and his boy,"Sarah GodfreyThe Horse and His BoyThe Horse and His Boy by C.S. Lewis is about a child who runs away form his family because he finds out that the father that has always said he was really isn't. So when the child runs away, of course he will bring his horse. In the series of the Chronicle Of Narnia by C.S. Lewis, everyone knows that Narnia is a magical world. There are talking lions, rats, horses, gofers, dears, there are Minnie midgets, dwarfs, giants, and all sorts of animals. Even the trees can talk. Well in The Horse and His Boy the child Shasta just went on a huge adventure through the woods and found his real father. The whole book is about him finding who his real dad is.Lewis, C.S. The Horse and His Boy, New York: 1954. 234 pgs."
5,An Unexpected Hero,"There are people who seem noble, and people who seem common. But when the chips are on the line, character is what really counts. This book is the story of a young boy without a history, who rises to the occasion.Besides being great ""adult"" reading, this is a great book to read to children (ages 4-5 and up). It gives them a picture of a hero to whom they can relate. Shasta is a young boy in a very bad situation who is given an extaordinary opportunity. This book is the story of what he does with the opportunity, and what he becomes in the process.If you plan to buy this, get the whole Chronicles of Narnia pack. You'll want to know the whole Narnia story."
4,Tai's QuickViews: Four Stars,"In a Horse and his Boy, Lewis describes the battle scene not through narration but through a sorcerer viewing the battle from a pool of magic water. brilliant"
4,striking read,this book is brillant! i find it a compellling read. it is a book that pulls you in with great description and amazing detail.
5,Beautiful and Touching,"This is an exciting story with such a beautiful picture of the theology that Lewis held dear. This book is a masterpiece and may be the finest work in the Narnia novels. Reading this out loud to my daughter nearly brought me to tears at times. This is a great, great book."
4,Not Quite What I Expected,"The Horse and His Boy is a great adventure, but is different from the other Narnian tales. Even though it is set during the time when Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund is in Narnia ruling, it is not really geared towards them.The horse's name is Bree, and the boy name is Shasta. They run away from their masters to live free in the north. Shasta and Bree do have someone join them on their journey along with another talking horse, but the girl doesn't really like Shasta. Shasta proves in the end to be a braver person, a more selfless person from everyone else. I liked Shasta from the very start, and I was glad to see him become something more than he thought he was.This is a book of travel and adventure, much like most of the Narnia books. It is good to read about familiar characters. It's like you feel connected to them because you read about them in other books.Another C.S. Lewis book I immensely enjoyed.Thanks."
5,Best of the Series,"This book was my favorite among the Chronicle of Narnia series. It is a great adventure story with intense chase elements, but it's not all adrenaline. There are also times when the main character is alone in a very scary place. This section is so gripping that it makes you fell almost claustrophobic.The ups and downs the characters experience are in the end purposeful. This book may be the young reader's first exposure to idea that God will sometimes use trials to get us to mature and that our actions during these times impact others. When this part of the story is told I came very close to crying. Before or since I've never been that moved by a fictional story."
2,The Horse and His Boy is ment for a Horse,"The horse and is boy is a pretty good book, if you're a person that likes watching a jar of mayonaise and infomercials all day. There were but a few good parts in this book, leaving about 3/4 of the book left to be boring. I mean, a little boy who runs around on a talking horse and being found a prince? That doesn't appeal to me. If I could summarize this book in one scentence it would be, ""Do NOT read this book!"
5,Belkin 12' RF video cable,"Wow...what a steal of a deal. The price was great, the delivery was fast & the product works great. What more can one ask for?"
3,This was a gift.,This was a gift on a wish list. Not bad for a young person. The quality is ok for a nylon wallet. Not sure how long the logo will hold up.
1,Inside shredded after 3 months,"This would be a great wallet if it was constructed of better quality materials. The outside nylon has held up fine, but the thin inside lining started tearing and shredding after about 3 months. Now 7 months later, it's unusable. I've replaced it with a leather Packers logo wallet from another source"
3,Overview of After Death Communication,"This book tries to put the experience of after death communication by mourners into some kind of perspective. It does this by discussing the varieties of experiences different individuals have, if and how they find the event helpful, and how to respond to others who report such encounters. ""Messages"" might be more useful for the unbeliever who needs to read how to begin exploring the phenomenon in a scientific way -- that is, just collecting the descriptions, looking at the number of incidents, how people respond, how after death communication differs from other related psycho/spiritual phenonenon, and the effect the experience has on the mourner. Personally, i found the question/answer format to be annoying but i can imagine that there might be some readers for whom that is exactly what they most enjoy. The table of contents lists all the questions and therefore gives a very good outline of the entire text."
2,"Not bad, not necessarily good either","Only the talent of guys like John Ritter and Eric Roberts can keep you interested in this slow-moving attempt at a suspense drama. Ritter and family are on vacation when they are conned, kidnapped, robbed and terrorized. With Eric Roberts as a villain it sounds like it would be good. Unfortunately Roberts isn't as intense as he was in The Specialist. What's even worse is instead of being scary they make him talk with a twirpy voice that gets obnoxious really fast. What were they thinking? John Ritter is good as always but there isn't much for him to work with. It would've been nice to see him get more revenge than he does in this movie. The premise of is very similar to the far superior Kurt Russell movie Breakdown which I recommend checking out instead. If you are a die-hard fan of Roberts or Ritter though, it should keep your attention. Keep in mind it's a low-budget direct-to-video movie and you get just what you would expect."
1,no thrills in this thriller,"This movie was just plain bad. It's amazing how far Eric Roberts sank with this film, it is amazing he was ever considered Oscar worthy. The late John Ritter was a good comedic actor but drama was not his thing. I prefer to remember him in better days like in Skin Deep. Rachel Hunter is a still beautiful model but as of yet I have seen no proof she can act. As far as Tripfall goes, Ritter and Hunter are a married couple on vacation who are abducted by Roberts, who is now type cast as the late night cinemax bad guy. The scheme is to force Ritter to withdrawl cash from the bank and well.....that is it. If you are a fan of any of the leads in this film I would not even recommend renting this. It will only lower your opinion of them. On a side note the extra's on the dvd include a trailer. It is hard for me to imagine this made it to theaters."
4,Not to be Overlooked,"Though first published in 1966 as part of the Preager world of art series, this book still has much to tell us about trends in 18th century, particularily French art. The chapter on Watteau, espiecally, still has a suberversive tone to it: Levey was trying to rescure, recuperate Watteau, showing him to be a suberversive figure, somewhat antagonistic to the Rococo style then championing, showing him to be prefiguring trends that would emerge later in the Revolutionary period. The illustrations, many in color, are well-carried out, and it makes a good read as well as a nice book to have laying around. You will find yourself picking it up every now and then, and with its small size you can take it along to the museum with you."
3,Too neat,"Pollini's interpretation of Beethoven's piano concertos is quite peaceful, clear and poetic particularly in the 1st and the 3rd concertos. However, I don't think Beethoven is as romantic and poetic as Chopin. I'd prefer a more dramatic interpretation of Beethoven's piano concertos with Ashkenazy/Chicago Symphony/Solti and Brendel/London Philharmonic/Haitink being my favorites. I do enjoy Pollini's performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in D major (the piano version after his violin concerto) a lot and I think which is much better than Barenboim's 1973's recording with the English Chamber Orchestra, but I just cannot make myself enjoy this set that much."
3,American Series - North Carolina - hardcover,"I ordered 3 of these books as brand-new. I use them for customers who purchase out-of-state investment real estate from me. They enjoy getting a book of the state they purchased in. 1 of the books was used. I was in a short time frame and needed to deliver the books immediately, so I gave 2 clients a brand-new book and 1 client a used book."
5,Lightscribe External DVD Writer,I am very pleased with this item-easy to install and use. Works great!
3,Item different than the shown picture,"This DVD burner was shown in the picture as a small drive like those slime drives. When I received it, it was very dissaopinting to see that it is totally different from the published picture in the site. It is bulky and relatively big, and not what they published in the site as the device image. I tried to call the distributor, no answers and they never replied me back to my email.It has no power switch also compared to all other drives that come with a on/off switch.The functios is reasonable, but nosiy."
2,"Horrible ""cheesy"" action film","Ouch this was horrible !The premise and idea for this movie was a good one, thus is had great potential.However it was totally ruined by......1) Way too much silly CGI and unrealistic action scenes that felt like a real-life Bugs Bunny cartoon.2) Campy and Cheesy humor like hitting somebody with a keyboard and having the flying letters off the keyboard form words in slow motion on the screen in Matrix-like fashion.3) A plot that took a second seat to special effects and thus was as deep as a thimble of water.If this same story had been filmed in a serious manner, it would have probably been very,very good ----- but instead it bounced around between serious, campy, cheesy, spoofy to the point that it seemed the movie did not know what it wanted to be.Ouch... this was just painful to watch.A totally forgetable movie."
2,Wanted: better movies these days,I remember being hesitant to even watch this movie in the first place and I should have gone with my first impression. I tried to like the movie while I was watching it I really did but it just didn't seem to stick. The only reason I really even did watch it was because Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman were in it they are a couple of my favorite actors but this movie seemed like a train wreck until the very end it just got more and more pointless and dumb. The graphics were good however when they came out with a video game I thought that was a good way to go but to sit there and watch the movie was like torture I was with someone who actually liked it so I had to watch it from start to finish. If you think you might not like the movie don't bother to pick it up you won't be disappointed.
5,Great Movie,"I originally went to see this movie not expecting much at all. However, by the time that the movie was over i wanted to see more. The action scenes are intense, and supporting actors MF, and AJ are outstanding. You do have to let your mind ease up around certain concepts or you won't be able to get passed it to really enjoy yourself."
3,O_K,"The movie was not half bad. Very UNREALISTIC in EVERYTHING. Jolie is beautiful to watch and the action scene were shot great. The story line, on the other hand, was o.k. Watch just for the action shots."
2,Forgettable,"Pretty forgettable movie. After seeing great action films like 'Shoot 'Em Up', this one comes off pretty lame and all smoke-and-mirrors. Barely give it 2-stars, and only because there are a couple action sequences are the decent. But overall, weak."
3,For the guys,"The online and TV trailers for this movie promised a gun-toting, kick-ass action flick with some skin of Angelina Jolie. And the movie delivers. The premise of the movie is simple; there is an organization of assassins called ""The Fraternity"". Induction is by personal selection and the ensuing grueling training process. Somewhere along the way, the leader of this Fraternity, played by Morgan Freeman, gives into greed and uses the talents of his organization to kill for hire. One of his subordinates, named Cross, leaves the group and begins fighting back. The Fraternity in turn finds Cross's son, tells him that Cross actually killed his father, and trains him to kill Cross.The movie is pure action, with lots of shooting, running, car chases, hand-to-hand combat, and the use of other objects as weapons. And yes, there is a brief shot of Jolie in the buff, though her tattoos are way too distracting. Overall, a rated R movie fit for the older teenage audience."
4,WANTED DVD,IT IS ACTED PACK MOVIE THANKS FOR THE QUIT DELIVELY TO I GOT WHEN THE INVOCE SAID I WOULD GET ON AUG 5 I GOT IT ON THE 4TH
5,Great Movie,Wanted is a great movie. The special effects are awesome. I think Angelina looks beautiful and I am totally loving her tattoos in the movie. Specially the one on her palm.
5,Wicked,"Being a fan of Angelina Jolie, I have nothing bad to say about this movie. The action and blood shed in this movie makes it in my top action flicks. Bending bullets? How can that be anything but cool to see?"
5,Wanted,"Great product, fast shipment, great customer service. This is a great used product no scratches with the art work and a really great price. Thanks for the quality"
4,WANTED more Angelina,Not more screen time but just more to her. have a hamburger or something. Other than that the movie was pretty darn good
1,Wanted is the worst movie of this decade.,This movie is horrible their were only two good scenes. When he cracks his co-worker with the keyboard and Angelina Jolie's Butt. I know it is a movie but this movie is so far-fetched. His heart beats ultra fast so he can shoot wings off of flies. Yeah right your heart would give out if you had it beating that much. That's why people are supposed to have slow heart rates. Also you cant jump through glass 40 feet onto another building. You can not shoot someone 6 miles away. This movie is lame. Save your money and buy a James Bond blu-ray or something he is more realistic. I would give this movie negative 5 stars if I could.
1,Horrible movie,"Wow, where do i start. The best part of the film, uhm seeing Angelina jolies butt, worst part the acting. its narrated and is nothing like the previews. Sure its about killers, but its far from action filled. Really? A organization based on a 1000 year old loom and binary code? Poor story and execution."
3,Not great,"I really enjoyed the action scenes - shootouts, car chases, etc. But the overall story of the movie is absolutely absurd. The scenes with Wesley and Janice reminded me of Office Space. :)"
3,Wanted: a mini-review,"Wanted stars Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman, and James McAvoy. It's an action movie, with a plot revolving around a group of super-assassins. It's got action, all right...some spectacular chase and crash sequences can be found herein. A serious movie, this is not...a group of super-rich altruistic super-assassins, as a plot device, do not stand up as a believable plot device. But, it's fun enough.Tagline of my own making: ""Wanted will make you believe in the magic bullet that killed Kennedy."""
1,WORST MOVIE YET/STILL SEARCHING,My wife had to have this on blue ray so I ordered it and we both watched it for the first time ever last night. The color is good as well as graphics. Thats it folks. Save your money and spend it some where else.
5,wanted ( limited edition gift set ) blu-ray,do you like angelina jolie's? although he is not also a major star. But the theme of the story which makes the charm of angelina here appears as the protagonist.in packaging eksclusive themed limited edition with a bonus in it so much. buy at amazon no loss because the goods are received remain in top shape so heavy and prone to remember the packaging of this edition. I'm excited and you do not miss to collect the film.
2,Insulting,I am really surprised to see this movie got over three stars..this movie is insulting for anyone with intelligence..only surprise in this movie when bad(good?) guys become really bad guys and the bad guy becomes a good guy. Action sequences are okay but neither special nor exciting...I rather have not wasted two hours...and money.
2,plot is good but main character is just a wimp,"Average frustrated chump, discovers is a super human, and learns all the skills of a professional assassin in a few days. The movie just does not take off, the director puts to much time on special effects and cg and did not trust his actors to carry the weight of the film."
3,so-so,"ok performances, no so predictable story line.I like James McAvoy and his portait of a lot of characters, but not so much for this one - it's certainly not his best role"
5,GREAT STORY LINE & SCORE!,"This film has become one of my favorites. Great story, script and musical score! I think it was very well done, indeed!"
5,Fun Action Movie!,I went into this movie expecting allot of great gunfights and action scenes... That's exactly what I got... If you went any deeper it wouldn't satisfy but it did what I expected...
1,Ridiculous,"If you are one of those people that can tolerate even a little ridiculousness in your movies, this is still not for you. Between bullets knocking each other out of the air, flipping Dodge Vipers, and other assorted nonsense, this movie goes from action to impossible to ridiculous to silly to plain sad (the last three are unintended). There is escapism, and there is stupid: this movie is stupid."
1,Terrible is not the word,"I rented this movie expecting it to be a good pop corn movie. Boy oh oby, it was one of the worst action movies ever. It was so bad that I could not see past the first 25 minutes. It is very predictable (even the dialogues) and does not offer anything new. Please save your time and money and keep away from this."
4,Wanted,Really like the special effects and style of this movie. Cast is very good. Amazon.com has good prices and fast delivery. Good place to shop when a department/specialty store is 20 miles away or more.
3,Style Trumps Substance,"It's ironic that a commercial for a video game precedes ""Wanted"". For a good hour or so the film seemed like a lot of white noise and blinding visuals. It's at about the halfway mark the story starts to kick in and there's some interesting plot twists. Alas, it's too little too late. Even at this juncture the director's in-your-face style overwhelms the picture. If they were going for ""The Matrix"" somebody should have told the makers of this film that style of ""The Matrix"" went hand-in-hand with the story the Wachowski's were trying to tell. Interesting but no dice."
3,A Comic Book Brought to Life,"""Wanted"" is indeed an action-packed movie paced at lightening speed. My first impression was that this was like a comic book come to life, and then saw in the credits that it was actually based on a comic book series. It certainly captures that feel.The story is very well related in other reviews. Young man drifting without goals and passion, gets swept into a fraternity of assassins formed a 1000 years ago. Descended from weavers, a loom allegedly in a secret digital code, picks the names of people these trained assassins are to kill. The young man is told he is being trained to kill the man who killed his father, also a member of the fraternity. But, is he?Obviously a lot of violence, killings, car chases and the usual gallons of spilled blood. Not for the faint of heart, but enjoyable for the legions of Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman fans."
2,Ridiculous,"This movie looked like it was going to be good in the beginning. Some guy going nowhere accidentally ends up in the middle of a shootout at the drugstore (while picking up his anti-anxiety medication). But it ended up just being one ridiculous action scene after another. There didn't seem to be much of a point.My positive comments are that I always love Morgan Freeman and the last scene was humorous. If you're looking for an action movie, I suggest that you keep looking."
2,Wanted is no longer wanted here,Wanted is a collection of special effects in search of a plot. When it was over I wondered why I had bothered to sit through the whole thing.
3,"Some pretty cool special effects, but nothing else...","I was highly disappointed with this movie! Not only was it painful to watch, it just plain sucked. I wish I could get my money back..."
2,So bad that I almost liked it.,"It almost seemed like this movie tried to do what Fight Club and The Matrix did, all at the same time. But, it failed. The story is almost good, but it seemed that the people behind this film wanted to focus more on ridiculous special effects and stunts. I had only slight attachment to any of the characters and didn't care for the special effects (too over the top). The most redeeming quality of this movie was the Nine Inch Nails tracks..."
2,Poor,"The only thing good about this movie is Angelina Jolie. she is great in anything, but this movie has no redeeming value."
3,Starts great....,"Going into watching this, I was expecting a popcorn movie: nothing deep but fun. I must say, the first half of this movie was as entertaining as I've ever seen Lots of great action, f/x, shots, and dialouge.Once the second half kicks in, it starts to run out of gas. It doesn't offer anything new and it starts to get repetitive. I guess they couldn't keep up the intensity from the first half.Overall, a pretty good movie that could of been better. Worth a rent.On a final note, Angelina Jolie looks rail thin here. Give that woman something to eat."
4,Be ready for blood,"Extraordinarily violent, tending to gruesomeness... ridiculous and implausible... but fun enough to rate 4 stars. The special effects are very well done, the acting is good, the semi-tongue-in-cheek is fine."
4,Wanted a great action flick with amazing stunts,"Wanted is a great action flick with amazing stunts. The plotline is pretty simple man is bored with his regular life, finds out his father died the gets dragged into a world he never thought was possible to kill the man who killed his father. Only to find out he was tricked by the people around him inculding the boss of the people trianning him to be a killer and an ultimate weapon for them to use to their benifit. Only he finds out the truth and must make a choice to run away or kill them all and ""let fate sort it all out.""I like the ending ""this is me taking back control of my life...what have you done lately."" So if your looking for a great action flick with great stunts, and lots of fight scenes with guns, knives, and things blowing up then you will love this style of movie. I have watched it mutiple times so far since I bought it a while ago."
4,Liked it,"I liked this movie, so I decided to get it on Blu-Ray. Never a dull moment when you have Morgan Freeman in a movie."
4,Movie to get Pumped for,"This is a really good movie. I walked away from this movie ready to become a super-skilled assassin.I love James McAvoy in this role. The movie has interesting background, but be warned. If you like the comic, this is literally nothing like the comic. Not even the ending. Since not as many people read before they saw, as a movie, definitely a good time."
1,Blah...,Another great comic made bland by Hollywood. Thanks for taking a great idea and pissing on it. Don't worry it has splosions and f-ects for those who can't read the comic...
2,Pretty bad....,"I love James McAvoy, he is a great actor, but I could only feel sorry that he had to work with this terrible script for an absurd movie."
1,what a waste of time,Save your money and your time..it is dreadful ..strong foul language for truly no reason ..graphic violence and a plot that goes very confusingly slow and never pays off. What a waste of a great cast and budget.
2,Did not like this movie,"So the overplayed plot of the chosen one is done once again, only such a story is done far better in other movies (Matrix, Underworld). ""Wanted"" is one of those movies in which you think to yourself during the movie, how did I get duped into thinking this was going to be a good movie... Was it the action packed trailer? Was it the trailer with Jolie? If you are a big Jolie fan then you might actually enjoy this. Otherwise, it is a bad rip off of other movies. And yes, the whole ""reading of the loom"" was just bad."
3,Secret society of assassins,"This is actions packed movie starring Angelina Jolie, Morgan Freeman and James McAvoy. A young accountant phobic and anxious lives dreadful existance in his corporate cubical producing meaningless reports. Until one day he runs into a beautiful woman (Jolie) who turns his life around. Before long, our accountant becomes fearless assassin belonging to a brotherhood of equally fearless colleagues.Film will keep you on the edge with car races, chases and back shot of Angelina Jolie's intricately tatooed body."
4,Wanted...,"Action. Betrayal. Cunning. Danger. These are but a few words that describe this effort starring Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie (among others). I can't really add more to the positive things that have been said (or the negative). I found the movie somewhat enjoyable. You do find yourself rooting for the 'kid' with all the 'Bull' he has to put up with in his sorry life (see for yourself). Well filmed, good special effects. I rate the flick: Four stars (and I actually recommend it - as a 'change of pace')"
5,Really good movie!,I really liked this movie years ago when it first came out. Seeing it in Blu-Ray made it worth buying it and watching it again. The special effects in this movie are great!
5,Loved it!,"Okay with modern technology comes Hollywoods ability to make things grosser, and more realistic. This movie has no shortage of f bombs and other extremely violent and bloody scenes. With that said, . . I LOVED this movie. Action packed, edge of your seat, nail bitter. James was very convincing as the average Joe stuck in meaningless life. Angelina was very convincing assasin, Morgan, . . I mean heck its Morgan Freeman. Well, casted, beautifuly filmed, nice storyline. Very entertaining. As a mom though, . . .VEWIER DISCRESSION ADVISED!!! Not for the young!!"
3,The Taco bell of Movies,"""Wanted"" is the Taco Bell of movies. You know it's not good for you and you'll most likely regret it, but there's a teenager inside you that says, ""What's the worst that could happen?"" So you watch it and a couple hours later you're rushing to the bathroom cursing yourself.The movie deserves two stars. I gave it three for Angelina Jolie."
2,Not Wanted...,Uggg. Terrible. I fell asleep. Read the Graphic Novel it's fantastic. The movie is crud. Another horrible movie adaptation from a flipping great book. Read the book you lazy illiterate jerks.
1,Special effects do not make a movie,I do not mind special effects nor watching Angelina Jolie. But this movie has no more plot than a category B video game. Watch The Matrix again instead.
1,So bad I turned it off before the end.,"Looking for an action movie at night one has a high tolerance for weak acting and bad scripts, but this was too much. Forget the money... don't waste the time."
1,Vile,"I hate this movie. It is vile. I think a ninth grade boy wrote it. This probably the target audiene. Unless you are a teenager don't waste your money renting it, rent something better."
3,20 million bucks is too much,"I expected a better movie from her and was disappointed. Her first Lara Croft movie was very good, the second, so-so. Some of her other movies are quite good and she needs to concentrate on them rather than the comic book stuff as in this movie. She must be an Elvis fan as I think she curls her lip more than he did. In this movie...Jolie has left the building."
3,Whats on the 2nd disk?!,"I cant find anywhere what is on the 2nd disk? Making of? Special Features? Eh, I'll probably buy the blue ray instead. I rated this 3 stars cause thats what I though of the movie, maybe the 2nd disk stuff deserves 5....i'll never know"
1,I didn't enjoy it.,"I love Angelina Jolie as an actress, so I was rather excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, it bored me so much I found that I was tuning out most of it, and I even dozed off at one point. The characters were all thoroughly unlikable, the plot was nonexistent, the dialogue was uninspired, and the action was very difficult to distinguish at times. The only time I remember looking up was when Angelina stepped out of the bath. I have to say, this is one of the worst ""action"" films I have seen in a long while."
1,"Waste of Time, Talent, and Action","Wanted is a Matrix rip-off without a decent plot or any redeeming qualities other than high octane action, great special effects, and Angelina Jolie. If that's what you are looking for, this is for you.The plot - a wimpy nerd finds out his father was an assassin with special powers is whisked away by the fraternity of assassins his father belonged to, and trained to be an assassin himself. And eventually go after the guy that killed his dad.Basically this is just a thin plot for action sequences and Angelina Jolie to show off her assets (literally in one scene).But the plot is so bad and the acting so mundane that for me it took away from being able to enjoy the movie. It was a wasted two hours."
2,Horrid,"I can't believe Morgan Freeman showed up for this film. It is gross! You would have to love violence, cursing, hate, brutality, and incredibly sick characters in order to tolerate this film."
2,Wanted--- DVD,"Like many recently produced DVD's, not much story line, but uses sex to fill up whats missing in thiller interest."
1,"Stupid, boring... what a waste","I am quite easy to please when it comes to movies, but this one.... What a waste of time. The only reason you might want to see this movie is for the action scenes. And they are not event that good, they simply don't work, everything is predictable, looks fake, and way to stupid to make any sense. You can picture the guys on their CGI station ""hey, let's drop a train from the sky, yeah, that's a good one!"". Well, in a way, I must say that I started to laugh about halfway through, so maybe it wasn't that bad. Still I am glad this is over."
2,Not worth it.,"While the idea of this movie was pretty good, the execution was poor. It was incredibly unrealistic and Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman added absolutely nothing to the film. Yes, there was a lot of action, and if that's your thing I would say go ahead and rent this one - but for me, it just wasn't enough to give it more than 2 stars."
4,Fantastic Package!,"If you like Wanted and want a lot more, than this is the deal for you, it's really a fantastic package, everything included is of really very high quality. From the disc's themself to the extra's included. I have expected this from Universal, and this is an example of how a special edition should be!!! I did find the price a little expencive, especially because i had to pay an extra 10 for customs!!! Higly recommended."
2,Boring & predictable,"Too many slow-motion special effects, it was boring & put me to sleep.The storyline is interesting, it could have been a good movie. The director failed."
1,Wanted - for 12-year-olds only,"I don't mind a good adolescent wish-fulfillment daydream. I assume that's what I'm getting anytime I rent an action movie based on a graphic novel. So I set my sights low. And I'm pretty good at suspending disbelief. ""Wanted"" however, demands that one not only suspend disbelief, but expel it permanently. Once you've bludgeoned your disbelief into submission, however, you won't find anything in this movie that was worth the effort. Spend the 110 minutes doing something else. Anything else."
4,Lost and never found,After waiting well past the expected due date. I notified the source company that the product was late. The next day I got an email from the shipper that they would issue a refund. Amazon refunded the purchase the same day!
1,Please don't say this was like the Matrix......,"I could go on and on about the stupidity of the storyline (a cloth of death?), or the absolutely ridiculous effects (curving a bullet around a circle?), but I'll just stick to this: It was horrible, and I was embarrassed for everyone involved. I suppose there is a chance that I didn't ""get it"", but if so, then for once I'm glad I'm in the dark."
3,I wanted more!,"`Wanted' was one of those action movies at the time of its release in theaters that people looked forward to. It looked promising and had a fine cast. The results were disappointing.If it wasn't for Angelina Jolie, this movie would have gotten a 2 star review from my part. The whole plot was very silly and obviously the action sequences a little hard to believe. The movie does have its interested moments; Angelina walking out of a Jacuzzi butt naked and some action scenes that were very well made. But besides all that it was a let down, expecting a further deliberation of a film instead of a flick that at moments looked like a kid had genuinely written the script.I rented `Wanted' on blu-ray when it came out and if you're into movies simply for the quality on your screen then I highly propose for you to get this one. Check out Angelina's scene walking out of the hot tub in slow motion. Extraordinary!"
3,Ten years to late,"If you go into this movie with realistic expectations you should not be dissappointed. The plot is pretty simple and very easy to follow. The actors are very good, Angela Jolie shows in this movie that she likes taking on roles that give her chance to do something besides be eye-candy. Morgan Freeman plays a role you don't see him play very often, and the supporting cast is good(Common is excellent).The action is great, the idea of curving a bullet is cool.BUTI couldn't help but think through the whole movie, ""this kind of movie has been done so many times, I'm bored with it."" You can take the F/X from this movie and you won't see anything that hasn't been done and in some cases done better in the last several years. I guess I'm saying all this is, is recycled action movie, which if that's what you're looking for you'll like. BUT if you're searching for something that you won't forget any time soon pass on this movie."
2,"FUN FOR SOME ACTION FANS, BUT TEDIOUS AT TIMES!","I like action movies and I can accept action movies that are silly, but this film is a slow starter and has some horrible dialogue! I'm sure it plays better to those who know the comic book this was based on, but for those of us who don't have a clue about the comic; this film will bore you at times. The good news is the second half is better than the first and it does have the beautiful Angelina Jolie in it.Some will like this film more than others as you can see by the wide range of reviews on this site. It's not completely horrible, but I won't be watching this a second time any time soon."
4,Just good fun!,"If you are looking for a movie that is entertaining, and has great matrixy special effects....you've found it. If you are looking for an oscar winning movie this is not for you. I do not go to the movies for realism..I live that every day. I go to the movies to escape, and have fun....that is why I like this film. It has a good cast and an entertaining story. As unrealistic as it is, I dare you to find a guy out there who would not jump at the opportunity to live this guy's life! Take a chance on this one..it is worth it!"
5,Wanted was a great movie to purchase and the actors great!,Wanted was a great movie and the actors did a great job I had watched the movie before and I enjoyed it very much and I look forward to seeing it again! the movie again makes being a member of Amazon.com quite enjoyable!
5,Great action,"I am 66 years old and love action movies, westerns, vampire etc. I thought this movie was great. It had me talking to the TV etc. I recorded it on my DVR but I will buy the movie to watch again so I can get the theater experience."
4,I LIKED IT A LOT,SAW THIS LAST NIGHT CHOPPED UP IN T.V. lIKED IT A LOT SO AM ORDERING FROM AMAZON TODAY. DO NOT AGREE THAT IS IS A BAD MOVIE IN ANY WAY. FAR FETCHED - YES - ENJOYABLE YES.
5,Wanted by Brandon M. Moskos,"I really enjoyed this movie. I pre-ordered the dvd because of suggestions from friends of mine. The acting is really good and so is the plot. Angelina is gorgeous in this movie, you won't be disappointed. I really enjoyed it."
3,"A decent rental, not worth buying (2 1/2 stars)..","When I first heard about this film, I thought for sure that some idiot was going to win a Darwin award by trying to ""curve"" a .45 cal. slug.This movie got hyped to the heavans but did not make a big enough splash at the box office to make any real money. Some of the action sequences are very cool but ultimately Wanted does'nt add up to much.Also, the plot of Wanted, about a group of assasins led by some mystical cult, is a great idea executed badly. The producer/directors relied too much on Angelina Jolie's appeal as the main box-office draw, instead of a well thought out story. James McAvoy, looking like a homeless person in the film, was supposed to excite female movie-goers. I don't think that worked either. Morgan Freeman and Terence Stamp are also in Wanted, both good actors given nothing much to do.I recommend a better hit-man film: ""The Mechanic"" w/Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent or Sonny Chiba's ""Golgo 13"". Buy those and rent Wanted."
5,WARNING.......,......don't drink an energy drink before seeing Wanted; your head might explode from over-stimulation. This movie ROCKS !
4,Good Action Movie with Twist.,"Not a great movie but an entertaining action movie. Recommended and worth seeing if you like action and special effects. Again nobody gives a great performance but overall the acting was acceptable. If you are looking for realism or a strong plot then probably not for you.I looked at some of the negative reviews and obviously some people missed the point of this movie. The point is entertainment! This movie is based on a comic book! It is not a documentary! One reviewer was looking for ""genuine emotion""? They should have done more research before seeing the movie."
3,"Ok, but can't hold a candle to Day Watch","If you've seen either Day or Night Watch, this movie may dissappoint. I found it kind of lacking in ideas, and somewhat predictable. All that being said, if you've not seen another of Timur Bekmambetov's movies, then you will probably like it.Oh, and Jolie is hot as always..."
3,Great action - Ridiculous plot,"If you can get past the idea of 10th century italian weavers translating cloth imperfections into binary code ( 7, 8 or 9 bit ? Stop bits ? Parity bits ? ) then translating the binary ( ASCII, EBCDIC ? ) into letters ( greek, latin, cyrillic ? ) and the letters into names, and get past the stolen bread van that could keep up with the Viper, and the curving bullets, etc, this could be your movie. The special effects were pretty special."
3,Entertaining But a Little Too Unrealistic,"This movie was entertaining but a little too unrealistic. I know movies are meant to help us escape reality, but I like to have a touch of reality with my movies. As a marksman and 15 year veteran of the military, I had a really hard time with the curving bullets and people hitting targets without aiming. A little bit too unrealistic for me but otherwise entertaining. There was an excellent plot twist at the end that caught me off guard."
3,Good movie with some very good actors,"This is a good movie which has some very unique special effects. Most were done in moscow so they are pretty far out there. The idea of bending a bullets flight and seeing two bullets hitting each other is not that believable, but seeing Angelina and Morgan freeman again was worth the price of the DVD. Story line was some what believable."
1,Disappointed!,"I was so excited to finally get to see ""Wanted"". But as soon as it started I was very uncomfortable. I am glad I didn't let my daughter watch this....since it starts out with a very explicit sex scene and language that I can do without. Did they have to use the language with every sentence? Was the sex scenes really necessary? The story line was awesome with the betrayal and twist, but would have been so much better without the language and sex.ANgelina was awesome in her performance as always. At least she didn't disappoint me as the others did. I wish that the producers and writers could understand that movies can be made and still be successful without all the sex and language. Others have done it, why can't they?"
1,Please Stop making Movies,"Angelina Jolie,This is a request from a huge fan of movies. I am writng today to ask you to please stop making movies. Every time you make one, the credit of the art of acting dies a little bit. You have yet to produce anything talent wise, and we are writing to ask you to stop once and for all. You are helping lots of people around the world with your humanatarian efforts, but hurting just as many (actually many more) with your acting ability. (sorry to anyone with acting skills, using her name and the word ability just seems wrong). So please go help the thousands you do help with your outside movies work, and help the millions who love movies and stop once and for all. PS, I have now seen a bunch of your movies, and would request you send me a refund. I am only asking for the money for ticket prices or the cost of renting, so it should not be a big deal, its not like I am asking for the price of time and brain cells lost by having to watch your movies."
1,Filled with sex,I wished I had known that it was a film full of sex because i would never have purchased it. Hollywood seems to be full of muck nowadays.
1,Offensive and Unecessary Opening Lost My Disk,What is Hollywoods fixation on gross for effect scenes only.The early opening has sex on a desk top for you to watch. My wife ripped the disk out and stomped it to death so that I could not return or resell it. She did not want anyone else to have to see at least that disk.I saw no value to the scene. Just ignorant film making.
3,Nothing you haven't seen before,"Slick looking action flicks with hyper fast camera work, slo-mo fx, cool soundtracks and a brainlessness that even dimwits can acknowledge and overlook are a dime a dozen, and there isn't much to get too excited about here. There are some really cool action sequences, but anymore for me, sitting through the nauseatingly insipid story with plot holes the size of Kansas takes extreme effort anymore. Hey, maybe they should skip a story altogether and just throw together the cool action sequences, yea! On a side note as the movie starts, I instantly wondered to myself if that Shia LeBouf guy from Disturbia and Indiana Jones was offered this role...the hyper emotional angst shtick he does is this character to a tee. Anyway, I was a bit surprised at the heavyweight cast, given the absurdity of the story, maybe they all saw the potential $$ that these eye candy movies can produce. Worth a look for some of the action sequences."
5,Non-stop action and incredible stunts!,Believe the laws of physics don't exist just for a moment and sink yourself into this incredible assasin fraternity fantasy. Very entertaining!
2,"An OK flick, but far from original.","Wanted is grittier than the Matrix, but you get the feeling that you've seen it all before. Office drone is plucked from his cubical cell life by a hot chick who drives almost as well as she shoots. African-American leader speaks in riddles and sends our reluctant hero into battle. Lots of killing without consequence. Lots of violent eye candy. Awakenings, betrayals, redemption. And wire work in place of a plot. It will entertain you if you have the stomach for it, just don't expect anything new."
3,Exciting but bloody,"I agree with the some of the other reviewers that this movie while exciting ultimately was more in the nature of a live action cartoon. After a while the blood sort of got to me, though it was not violent in the sense of heads being chopped off. Just lots of shooting."
3,Wanted DVD,"We enjoyed the movie story line, but did not like all the foul language. It could have been made without using such language."
4,wanted limited edition,Great movie but not worth price with extra content. I wish I bought the regular version saved some money.
5,wanted 2 disc dvd,This movie was fantastic. I can not believe the young man was the one who was in the first Narnia movie. Great action movie for anyone.
4,An Ok Box Set,This is a Ok Box Set and for $18 You can't go wrong the only thing is it doesn't come with a whole lot of items I counted at least 4-5 Different items in my set. Mind you that when this set came out it was priced at stupid money but now it's at a decent price I say purchase it at your own will or wait for another price drop but I doubt that will happen so if your a Collector pick it up if not just get the standard blu-ray!. Hope this helps.
3,disappointed with digital copy,Digital copy didn't work. I dont get the whole digital copy thing anyway though. Otherwise its a good movie and looks great in HD.
2,Good overall idea,"but the execution fails.If you really like special effects, this is probably a good choice for you. If you want a main character to root for, not so much.Wanted has the kernel of a good movie in it. Unfortunately, the main actor just can't pull it off, and Morgan Freeman just doesn't do that much in the movie.However, Angelina Jolie is quite good. Remake the movie, make her the main character, and Wanted would be much better. Jolie's Final scene is perfect for her character. Unfortunately, the finale continues from them. Still not quite clear on what the point of the last line. I should feel bad for not killing people?Regardless, pick up if you like special effects or Jolie (she really is quite good in this), otherwise very easy to skip."
3,blu ray incompatible with my player,Movie was enjoyable but I had to watch the DVD as the bluray was incompatible with my jvc xv-bp11. I do have the latest firmware and it is the only disc I have been yet unable to play. I buy region free blurays from the uk all the time without problem.The 3 star is for the movie as I never downgrade for shipping or service.
4,"Great movie, Blu-Ray version is required!","Given the fast action, the Blu-Ray version is a MUST-HAVE. Jerry (my husband) and I watched the regular DVD in our bedroom after we got this Blue-Ray combo. We don't have a Blu-Ray player there. Great movie of course, great action but... We then after a day or two put the Blu-Ray disc in our family room's Blu-Ray player to watch the alternative opening scene. And in doing so, we fond ourselves watching the ENTIRE movie again! Because really, this movie deserves a High-Def, 1080p viewing given its action, its amazing bullet effects, and so forth. We are thrilled we didn't just get the regular DVD version only."
3,"""Wanted"" is mindless, violent, over-the-top, silly and . . . absolutely fun!","This is the kind of film one is usually embarrassed to admit he enjoyed. The plot, such as it is, is laid out by Amazon well enough, so I won't repeat the silliness here. This film is just a slam-bang good time with good actors, who should all know better, but thankfully didn't as one can see they had a fun time with this film too.The action is swift, incredible, loud, and violent, but it's nothing to take seriously. The effects and stunt work are most certainly praise-worthy although repetitive to a nauseating degree.The film does waffle around whether it's parodying its genre or trying hard to add to it. One moment it's all tongue-n-cheek and the next it seems to take itself far too seriously.Well, regardless of its flaws, this is one fun movie that I very much enjoyed as silly as it was (hangs head in embarrassment)."
4,WANTED,This product was received on timely basis and it also was received as promised for the qualityit stated prior to ordering.Frank Joseph
2,Nah...,"Having seen Timur's Russian movies, I am glad to see him get some publicity in the West. He has been able to incorporate some awesome visual effects into some quite inventive action movies. However, with ""Wanted:"" some of the effects in this movie are the same effects I've seen in his other movies, the plot is lame and brainless and completely predictable, the performances are solid but characters are completely one-dimensional, and by the time the film was finished, I felt ripped-off. Ah well, just don't expect much and you may be entertained for at least 90 minutes..."
3,Average story line...Max Action,I liked this movie because it didn't make me fall asleep like some newer action movies out there. I most likely will buy it and add it to my collection. I'm glad I waited to see at home and didn't pay to see it on the big screen.
1,Awful,"One of the worst movies I have seen in the last year or two. The plot is nonexistent, the SFX are dated and pulled right out of the matrix, and the 'twist' at the end is completely moronic.The point of movie seems to be that you are not a 'real man' unless you want to blow someone's head off. ugh. on a scale of 1 to 10, this one rates a 10 for hollywood trashiness."
1,piss poor,"This movie was awful. The action sequences seem written by a fifth grader with the imagination which could only come from a boardroom struggling to find a new concept for an action movie. I really have to wonder how the hell this became a major motion picture, did someone owe someone a huge favor? Seriously this movie was obvioulsy written, then plugged with some over-the-top twists. If this movie held your interest then I hope you are under the age of 14, and consequently restricted from seeing anything but the previews. Also the direction and acting were both sub-par, it was a shame to see Morgan Freeman in this feature, he should fire his agent."
1,Another dumb Jolee Movie,"Thr story line started out good but ended poorly. It was a typical Angelie Jolee movie - dumb, dumb, dumb."
2,"We thaught, well at least Jolie is hot!","My brother and I saw this movie upon it's release in Billings MT. We thaught that if all else failed, at least Angie Jolie is sexy and the other kid has been good in films, so what the heck. Well all did fail, what a dud! To quote my brother upon leaving the theater, ""It was the coolest and stupidest movie of the summer!"" Yep that about sums it up."
3,"Ok, but not great","This book is easy to read and provides great instruction for various points in training a new puppy. My only ""beef"" with the book is that, like the DK books, it puts information in pictorial form and in paragraph form in each section, but unlike DK, the information provided is identical in the two areas. For me, I may start out reading the pictorial description, but if I've then decided to read more in the paragraph portion, I'm looking for more indepth info or to read something different. It isn't helpful to have the same exact words written two times on each page. I actually preferred the ""Keep it Simple Series""--puppy training book from DK that I purchased (unfortunately loaned out and not returned) when we got our other dog 4 years ago."
5,Easy to use - pictures and text for training your dog,"I bought an extra copy of this book to give to the new family who adopted one of our puppies. The photos and instructions for training are excellent and friendly for any age user. This family has middle school children and it is an easy format to read. The other book I recommend is ""21 Days to Train Your Dog"", also in paperback. We are teaching our older dogs some new tricks, easy to follow steps. Either book is well worth the money and will be useful for all dog lovers and owners."
3,Puppy Book,This is a general dog training book. I guess the people that wrote this just read some books and rewrote their book from that. This is not a #1 dog training book...at least that is my opinion.
4,Quite Interesting.,"For those of us today that would like to think that the role of the US Army should be only fighting wars, you need to read this book. From the very founding of our nation, our Army has served as both an instrument of waging war and an instrument of waging peace. This book goes a long way to defining the Army's role in the settlement of the Old Northwest. The author reviews the Army's roles in public works, the building of public roads, its taming of the wilderness, its scientific achievements and its role as frontier policeman.This is a short work but a very good companion to Robert Utley's Frontiersmen in Blue. In times of peace, the American military's impact is every bit as important to the development and protection of America as it is in time of war. This excellent little book reveals that the Army has always been an instrument of America's development and most likely always will be."
3,not what i was looking for,"This item works fine, my only problem is that i expected the audio files to be easily transported out of the device and into folders in my computer, however i found you cant,(i had hoped to add its audio to videos i'd made) but if your looking for a dictaphone from which to take notes from lectuers and interviews, its perfect.oh and dont bother with the camera function.its useless."
4,Spy son loves it!,"My son asked for this for Christmas and I consented but may live to regret it as I'm sure he will end up recording something he is not supposed to hear! ;) But, it did come in very handy when my daughter had to learn a song that we could only find on the internet and we recorded it with this and all she had to do was walk around for a day with this digital recorder and play it over and over until she got it down. It takes pictures, but you cannot see them on the screen immediately...you have to download to your pc to see them. Great lower priced recorder for kids. :)"
3,adequate recorder for the price,I bought this for occasional use to make quick recordings that would be the basis for written reports later. It is acceptable for that job. I've tried the camera but the light has never come on to show that it is ready to take a photo. But it is a very low resolution camera that I did not plan on using anyway. Cell phone ones probably work better.
1,"no talk time, difficult to use software",Bought recorder to replace sony digital that was lost. The sony had six hours of talk time. This recorder has less than two hours in lp. I wasn't paying attention when I bought this. I have not been able to get the software for the camera to work after several attempts. You cannot use the camera without it. Purchasing this recorder was a mistake.
2,no go,"the usb cord wasn't recognized by any computer, so nothing was able to be uploaded off this contraption. i didn't find this out until over a year into using this; i move slowly sometimes. customer service recommended i get a new cord. duh! they would not replace it, however."
4,Solid recorder for the money,"As others have said, the low quality setting yields poor results unless the sound source is close by and quite loud. That said, the high quality setting seems to work quite well in a variety of situations. I haven't used the camera, but I would suspect that it is poor, at best."
3,A good little voice recorder,"The voice recorder works great, and is easy to operate. Forget the camera, I wasn't expecting much but taking any picture indoors is useless, don't buy it for the camera."
1,mistake,To order this from the seller was a mistake. The product was not as advertised (quite inferior). My e-mail to the seller after receiving the product was never acknowledged nor has a refund been forthcoming (I returned the product). This is always a danger but is my first bad experience. This is an entirely negative review.
4,"fun, practical, conversation piece",Pro: A wonderful tiny device I tend to carry with me everywhere. Con: I cannot see the photos til I get home!Solution: Olympus(or someone) should create software so the w-10 could send images to a pda (palm or PC Pocket OS).
2,the camera does not work,"i would like to return it, the camera does not work ...will i be reimbursed my $10 shipping ?"
1,Slaptick camera,"The Camera is a piece of trash, it will not allow the picture to be taken unless it's sensor finds enough light or if there is too much light, it will not take the picture. You must move around all over the place looking for a green light to come on. Then the picture looks like crap and says nothing that if you had taken it 3 inch. to the left, it would have been worst. The Voice Album software is unstable and crashes with HP printer drivers. The USB function is then useless. The recorder is cheap in sound w/ the worst point and click camer...it should not even be called a camera slaped together with make shift software"
3,"Raw, unrefined, and quite fun!","Raw, unrefined, and quite fun. French electronic is unique in its mix of modern beats with classical bend. Some songs quickly become different midstream. The mix is unique for those who appreciate music on an ADD level.I had to listen to the CD several time to get a grip of the newness of this sound. Afterwards, it all became quite clear - and quite addictive too!Florian offers by far some of the best beats in the mix. `Funky Housy Hoover', `Vent D'ame', and `Spleen Part 1' and fun, danceable, and with addictive bass lines. Kia's `A la fraiche' is a monster dance song (very well produced!).The remainder of the CD is an odd-ball mix of sounds that don't quite meld. The intent of Paris Under A Groove - Vol 1 is to introducing the world to French electronica - and it is successful. Yet some cuts (like the bizarre `Mon pote kia' would have been better served off the CD.Anyone who enjoys new electronica will appreciate this French offering!"
4,loungy beats for beautiful people sipping martinis,"What a great album. Perfect for bridging that section of the night between cocktails and candy. If you're a fan of the Nordic Lounge series you'll love this, and so will your guests. Four big fat stars from me."
2,uh.. it's just okay...,"I ordered this cd based on the reviews. First, I have to say that I am not sure why it is called 'Paris Under a Groove'. I was thinking that it would be in French, at least. The beats are nice, I would not in any way compare it to Buddha Bar.. I just wasn't as thrilled as I thought that I would be. It sounded very cheap. No originality. My fiancee is from Paris, and this was very disappointing- not only to him- but I was embarrassed as offering it as a present....So far, it sits on the shelf..."
3,*Meh*,"First, let me admit my bias: I'm searching for that fusion of Jazz and Electronica that actually demands attention from its listeners. This is hard to come by; mostly, ""jazztronica"" collections tend toward chill and background music.Which brings me to this album. The St. Germain track ""Prelusion"" is worth the price of admission, primarily because of the strange snake-y bleeps-and-bloops that swirl around the more standard drums 'n pads. I also dig the So Daft rmx., a solidly funky electronic display that reminds me a bit of Telemetry Orchestra and the Sydney electro movement.But then there are also tracks like the dissappointing ""Torch Tatami Blues"" -- not much happens here, and the beat loop (which stays relatively constant throughout) is clearly ripped directly and used without alteration from Bill Laswell's Oscillations, Vol. 2. Hrm."
2,Problematic,"Had problems like others after a few uses; water dilvery, ready lamp. This unit is apparently VERY sensitive with the water streaming circutry. Took mine completely apart to either bypass unnecessary soap bottle or otherwise. Don't even think about doing it as the problem is elsewhere, (within handle/water heater area). Water availablity seems to be totally dependant on bottle seals being tightly connected. Works sometimes. Good luck, wouldn't buy one with this problem otherwise it is solid, strong, good unit."
1,Do Not Buy This!!!,"This is the third one of these in my family and all of them broke after occasional use over two years. I also experienced the wand falling off every two seconds. My mother in law had two of them and they both stopped spraying soap and water. It ccost almost as much to fix as it would to replace. It did clean capets but once turned off it would leak dirty water onto the surface it was resting on. I had to make sure I put it on the hardwood when I was done. I was trying to clean it out because it wasn't sucking as well as it used to. When I went to put it back together,I couldnt get everything to line up. We took it to a local repair facility and was told it needed a new housing, belts and labor for a mear $112. It is a gigantic waste of money and will be thrown out for a third time. Please dont waste a penny on this POS. I would give it 0 stars but it wont let me."
1,Waste of Money,This machine is a complete waste of money. The sprayer worked correctly only once for me. I wish I had researched more before I bought it because I spent money on something that will end up in a garage sale.
3,Work great when it's running,"I got this machine a year ago and loved it, however after six months it seemed to junk out. I have taken the whole thing apart and cleaned out the hoses and checked the pump and nothing I try works. The problem I had is that it suck up the water but it will no longer spray the chemical or water out onto the floor so I have resorted to dumping buckets of water on the floor and using the machine to suck it up. I threw it out today and am going to buy a differen't steam cleaner. Over all it worked extremely well when it was up and running correctly."
1,Not happy with it either,"After having regular Bissell Vacuum cleaners and having no problem with them, I thought I would try a steam cleaner from them. I wish I had read the reviews first. It is cumbersome to use and to change any parts. It worked very briefly but it no longer sprays water, yet the brush rotates. However, the hand attachments do spray. I now have to attempt to check the belt, since that may be one of the problems (according to the instruction leaflet) that is not making it spray. If the belt is fine, I am not going to bother to try and have it repaired. Not worth my time and aggravation. Just will research other cleaners. Since it is only me (and no pets or children), I do not use it as much as others but it should not be breaking down so quickly."
1,it breaks down regularly....don't buy,"I bought my unit in Sept 07. The first time I used it after a little while it just stopped dispensensing the water and soap. (the suction still worked). It was under warranty so I took it in for repairs. They had to replace the motor and the belt. It took 3 weeks. When I got it back I started to clean my carpets and after about a 1/2 an hr I smelled a funny smell, it stopped dispensing water and soap, and there was smoke for a few seconds. I took it back again to replace the motor and belt.So far its been out of service most of the time I've had it.It also goes through soap very quickly and leaves the carpets very wet.I would never ever buy another one nor would I reccommend it to anyone. i would have given this 0 stars but it wouldn't accept that so I had to enter one."
3,I have owned it for 5years and it broke on me today!,I have never had a problem with this steam cleaner till now. I just suddenly will not work the only thing that it does is suck up the water. The motor is running and the brushes are spiing. My mother in-law has the same one and she has only used it twice!! It is also doing the same thing as my Bissle does. I am now going to buy a Hoover!! I gave it three stars because my cleaner has worked for five years
2,Not recommended,"My wife thought this would be a good investment, given that it costs less than one cleaning by a professional service. Unfortunately, after using it maybe 5-6 times, it no longer dispenses any liquid. (When it was working, it was slow and didn't do as good a job as a professional.) Have followed all maintenance and trouble-shooting suggestions to no avail. Only option is a 60 mile drive to the nearest authorized service center. Needless to say it's going into the trash. We will not buy another consumer grade machine. Will look into prices on commercial grade options."
2,Do Not Buy!,I hate this machine. The small tank that holds the cleaning solution will hardly ever work properly. Most of the time your solution will end up in a one spot since the tank leaks. Recently had the problem of water dispensing. Wish I had researched more before buying. Buy a different product.
3,Excellent cleaner - while it lasted,"I purchased this about 2 years ago and have used it for light/normal cleaning. At first it was excellent and it quickly paid for itself. Now 2 years later, the yellow dial has snapped leaving it on 'hose' only, the bristle pad has broken off the hose and the clip to hold the hose when storing has snapped off. It also leakes shampoo from the bottle straight onto the floor under the cleaner and the water no longer heats up so by the time it reaches the carpet it is only warm not hot.Overall I loved it for the first year but it is now ready to be replaced. Will look for a better quality cleaner this time."
1,Defective Machine; Won't Last,"We bought this Bissell in the midst of potty-training our son, so we had plenty of spots to clean. And I loved the machine at first, especially how it heats the water and is very quiet.But after 5 months of moderate use, it no longer locks in an upright position and it consumes cleanser like a fish consumes water.NOT GOOD FOR THE LONG RUN."
1,NOT Recommended- Poor Machine,"These are fragile, unrepairable machines. Works well at first, but will soon fail. You are lucky if the brush drive fails within warranty: at least they will maybe fix it once. Mine broke just out of warranty. Repair cost almost at much as a new machine. This is a poorly designed, low quality machine. My advice is to rent a professional machine."
2,"Cleans well, but tedious","It cleans well but the water and solution container seem to run out every 5 minutes, regardless of the setting! With the refilling, it took over 3 hours just for 2 small rooms! The on/off switch is in an inconvenant place so it was tedious every time I had to refill/dump the water. The hose attachment kept falling off onto the floor getting in the way and I had to stoop down and reattach that constantly. I used it 3x and it already broke down on me and my husb had to take it apart. My back aches from constantly bending over to exchange the water and my hand is cramped. I'd compromise on the clean to have it more user friendly."
1,machine quick to break,"Bissel model 7901-6 pro-heat advatage.First problem, the thing stopped spraying.Also the tool attachment suction is lousy. It left the chair quite wet. I used a shop vac to try to suck up the excess water. I was amazed at the amount of water I was able to recover.I would never buy it again with what I know now. Stay away from this piece of junk. It works good but only for a short period of time."
2,Buyer beware,"I've had this machine for not even a year yet. Worked great, did a heck of a job, however one day it just quit working. Contacted Bissell. They gave my husband and I a few suggestions. Nothing worked. My husband took the whole machine apart. Nothing but plastic junk. Bissell told us to take the machine to a designated dealer to have it fixed. It would have cost us more to have it fixed then what we paid for the machine itself. Does the machine work great? Why yes it does, but shouldn't it last longer then ONE YEAR!!!! Will definitly NEVER buy another from Bissell. Junk!"
1,worthless,"I purchased this item 18 months ago, used it 3 times. I put it away exactly how the manufacturer recommended and 6 months later I went to use it and it will not dispense water or cleaning fluid. There is no reason for it, it just quit working. Spent 189.00 on this machine and was only able to use it 3 times. I am going to have to throw it away because we are out of warranty."
4,Does a great job,"Easy to assemble. Once I got the hang of how to operate the machine it did a great job. Light, easy to handle. Would definitely recommend."
3,Average,"This mediocre-machine has a container within a container. The bladder type of container holds the clean water while the dirty water goes out-side the bladder. The problem is the bladder opening often falls in, mixing the dirty & clean water together. Customer service who readily replaced my tank was prompt and curteous.Suction is okay. Brush is okay. I haven't checked the outlet temp, but it supposed to raise my water temp by 25F, but I don't think that's happening.Overall, it's an average machine from the wally-world. It works compared to the Hoover that brokedown, so I guess that's a plus. Just a few more months of these and we're getting hardwood floor, so bu-bye stinking steamers."
1,"This ""sucks"" and not in a good way","This machine worked great for the first 6 uses (a total of 12 rooms). I always cleaned and stored it according to the manufacturer's instructions. Now it won't spray at all. I have replaced the pump belt and followed the troubleshooting steps, but it still won't work. Of course it is now out of warranty, and from what I have been reading from others, I will be wasting my time and even more money if I continue making attempts in having it repaired. For the few reviewers, who have indicated that the majority of us must be idiots and did not follow the manufacturer's guidelines, are you some how affiliated with the Bissell Company? This has taught me to look at ""the consumers' reviews"" before making future, large purchases. If you have recently purchased this machine and still have your receipt, I would suggest that you return it for a full refund while you still can. Even if it is cleaning great right now, I promise it will soon become worthless."
1,Have had 2 they both does,"[...]. It worked great the first few times I used it. Then after the warranty was up, it stopped spraying soap and water. After some research, It looked like it was a bad pump. The vacuum place said the pumps go out regularly. $35 later and some time installing it and still no spraying fluids. Gave up and stupidly bought another one. I have had it for 3 years but only used it a few times, mostly for just one room. Took it to the cabin this weekend to clean the carpets, pre treated a small room and then it stopped spraying. Took it apart, the pump works, but has a poorly designed trigger that makes it spray. Tabs were broken and well as two screw mounts for the vacuum pump. Threw the mess in the trash where they belong.DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE - THEY ARE TRASH ANS POORLY DESIGNED>"
1,what a peice of junk,"I purchased this because it sounded like a quality item form the commercials but when i got it home and used it, it was a nightmare. The trigger would get jammed and it did'nt suck the water back up. It left my carpet soaked with soapy water. I had to place fans on the carpet to get to dry. I took it back to the store and purchased and Hoover steamvac. It was wonderful.Remember, you get what you pay for."
3,Does good work but breaks easily!,"My mother bought this product and loved it. I asked to borrow it one day and it did a wonderful job on my carpets. It was easy to use and it wasn't messy like some of the other steam cleaners I've used.Unfortunately, when I returned it to her, it would no longer spit out water. I had been very careful with it during transport and use so I couldn't believe it was broken!We took it to a shop to have it repaired. They automatically knew exactly what was wrong with it. In fact, they said that they got these particular steam cleaners in all the time and they always had the exact, same problem.There was a piece inside of it that had broken. They had a whole supply of that particular part. 10 minutes and $20 later, it was working again. He told me that it probably wasn't my fault at all, which made me feel better. Still, there is an obvious flaw with this machine, and for the price, Bissell really needs to fix it!"
1,Does not clean as well as it should,"I bought this product to keep up with a dog and a three year old. We had bought new carpeting about a year ago and we thought that this would be a good insvestment. The first time I tried it, I like it because it seem to clean well and consistently.However, when the carpet cleaned I saw streaks of dirt here and there. And now when I use it I have to make sure that I go three or four times over the same spot at different angels because it just doens't clean well.I might have a defective machine since it DOESN'T spray the solution evently. I have tried cleaning it but it still gives me the same problems.Do yourself a favor and go rent a machine instead of buying this machine!"
2,Not very happy,"I originally had a Hoover, that was great - lasted about 7 years. I only had this Bissell for about 9 mos and the motor now has to be replaced. Unfortunately, I never registered my vacuum so I have no warranty info. Also, we found this vacuum was extremely loud compared to the one I had before. I did not have problems with leaking, however, I have to agree with another reviewer - that the dirty water canister is very difficult to clean compared to other machines."
3,Good While It Lasts,"I have now gone through two of these. I would call my use light/normal. While the cleaner works well at first, both of mine have suddently quit spraying water after about two years. I took the last one apart and completely cleaned to no avail, hoping that it simply had a clog somewhere. After two hours of dirty work, I found a broken plastic piece near the beater bar- don't know if this was the problem but the whole assembly is plastic- probably the industry standard??? Anyway, a good machine considering what it would have cost me to have professional cleanings!"
1,Don't buy this machine,"Like other reviewers mentioned----it will work great in the beginning, but soon it will be nothing but a repair project and a hassle.3 Tanks replaced, leaking water from everywhere, no suction, doesn't clean the carpet and just soaks it in water.We brought it to a repair shop to replace some parts ( seals and suction thingy).70$ later and it broke down 2 cleanings later. As for the suction: the repairman told me that it won't get any better.Calling the service was a waste of time, because they ask you to check a bunch of things on the cleaner ,only to tell you to bring it to a repair shop.It's sitting in the corner now, since it leaks water from somewhere and will be trashed soon."
1,Bad choice,"At first, this product seemed great. I used it on a rental property and it did a magnificent job. In actuality, I think the carpet was cleaner than when a professional did it. (A professional just goes over everything VERY quickly).The problem is, it is now just a very big, heavy, weak shop-vac. It stopped spraying out water and detergent after a very short time. I tried manually spraying the carpet in front of the machine and using the machine to pick up the water, but what a waste of time. I will never buy one again. It has been extremely frustrating."
2,Good for spot cleaning not for cleaning entire rooms,"I have only had great results when using the floor tool. When I try to clean entire rooms, it looks as if nothing was cleaned. The floor tool constantly falls off the hook when using it for floors and the solution mixer says I run out of solution when it's full, leading me to believe the solution doesn't even get mixed in with the water when doing floor cleaning. The hand tool works fine and that's all I can use it for now. Every time I shut the machine off, loads of water leaks from under the machine so I have to make sure it's off the carpet before shutting it off. Next time I will buy the little green machine or spot lifter instead and rent the Rug Doctor when I need to clean the entire room."
2,Cleans great IF you can get it to work-,"Piece of Junk, Bissell customer service is even worse than there macbines. Go for the hoover!"
1,Piece of junk - works short term only,"Like most of the other reviewers, I'd rate this steamer as a short-term wonder only. Works great at first then won't mix the solution or won't dispense the water after a few uses. Motor burned out on mine after a little over a year. Used maybe 12 times, mostly on small stain clean ups. Hoover customer service is no help and they are indeed aware this model is a lemon. Don't buy it- go for the Hoover that's in the same price range."
1,Mediocre at best,Does not have the lifting power of a hoover. Although it sound nice to have the seperate thing for soap it causes more work as you are constantly refilling both compartments. The heater is not much of a heater. But the biggest issue is the tendency to break. I've had mine for less than a year and have had to replace both a belt and a pump. It is now broken again. It's just not worth the money.
2,Steer clear of poor quality and design,"Bought a Bissel Proheat cleaner. Used it approximately eight times at various locations. A small piece of plastic used as a retainer for the brushes broke. It was impossible to just call bissell and get a replacement part. Instead, they advised to take it to an authorized repair facility, with a minimum charge of $30 to $50. Even after it was repaired, the supply tubing for the water clogged. As of this date I have not been able to make a repair. Unlike other well designed products, e.g. Panasonic vacuum cleaners, which are easily accessible for repair, this large, heavy and cumbersome machine is a waste of money and simply provides additional frustration in your life. Steer clear. I hear the Hoover machines are more durable."
2,Costs less per application to rent,"My first machine broke after three uses. I figured it was just accidental and I would try it again. My second machine lasted about the same time, three uses. This time it didn't exactly break. It just stopped cleaning. They seem to do a nice job on the first use. The quality of the job then deteriorates rapidly. I doubt if the people who rated this machine five stars, had the opportunity to use it more than three or four times. I am now looking for another good quality machine, but definately not Bissell."
1,Don't buy!,"This cleaner is a joke! When I first turned it on, it didn't work. After checking everything, the belt was not on. The belt came off 5 times before it stayed on. The upholstery hose doesn't work at all. Didn't know that until I had already wet the area. Zero suction, no matter what you do. Very poor job on certain rugs. You cannot get the water suctioned out. I bought a Bissell canister 15 years ago, and still works great, but wanted a new upright. The joke was on me!"
1,DEFECTIVE-DO NOT PURCHASE,"August 11, 2008I purchased my Pro Heat about 5 years ago. I used it shortly after I purchased it and all was fine. This use occured over a single weekend.I pulled out the machine and tried to use it. Sprayer for the floor didn't work. I tried boiling hot water assuming the line was clogged, I tried pressurized air to clear the line...and nothing. In disgust, I took to a repair shop. It costs $30 for an estimate from Vac & Sew company. They just informed me it's about $109 to repair.Wish I had read the reviews for this junk beforehand. DO NOT BUY!I'll be taking a sledge hammer to mine in a ceremony of corporate shame for Bissel."
1,WHAT A PIECE OF CHEAP JUNK!!!,"This is one of the biggest pieces of cheap junk that I have ever bought. I'd rate it a 0, but you have to give it at least 1 star. I followed the instructions too the letter. I used it 5 times in a little over a year on my living room (15' x 18') and the hall. Right after the guarantee was up it stopped spaying. I ended up having to pay to have it fixed and the repair man said, ""he gets 20 to 30 of these in every week to fix for the same thing"". Now on the seventh time that I am using it the vacuum is going out and will not suck up the water. I've sense know 2 other people that bought one of these and had the same problems. DON'T waste your money on this pieces of cheap junk."
1,"Do not buy this, waste of hard earned money","I have owned this machine along with two other bissell units, see the pictures I posted. They break,plain and simple. If you think it is worth 200.00 dollars to pay to clean your carpet once then this machine is for you.I think a bad machine should be taken off the market and this Bissell company know's these are crap.BUY A HOOVER YOU WONT REGRET IT"
2,Good until it breaks,"I have owned 2 of these carpet cleaners. The first one I loved until it broke. I tried fixing it many times, ordered spare parts from the internet. It kept breaking so I bought a new, same model, Bissel cleaner. After a few months same problem. Belts broke, plastic knobs broke, plastic hose holder broke, The groved pulley on the brush broke. Even ordering spare parts, and using parts from the 1st Bissel did not keep this second cleaner running for more than a year. These are expensive items, and I cannot afford to replace them every year. I do like the heat aspect, and when these carpet cleaners work, they are wonderful. But too many cheap parts, too much plastic for me. I will buy a more expensive model Bissel proheat next time. Also, I have one room with deep pile carpet, really thick, probably 2 inches long. Do not use this model on deep, long, heavy pile carpet. You will burn up the belts for sure. This model cannot handle deep pile carpet."
1,broke after two years,"What a flimsy product! Bought this item at B*** B** for about 185 bucks including tax. I have a yellow lab and light hair on the carpet is an issue. I have used this carpet cleaner probably just over ten times, but less than 20 times. It uses lots of water and detergent, and constantly leaves lumps of pet hair on the carpet, which I run around to collect. Quite hard to use, but I was somewhat satisfied with the results.Then it happened last July 2007, the flimsy floor/tool dial's flap broke at the weakest design. The water did not circulate. I opened the top cover, and tried to glue it, but it did not work. Frustrated, I put it away. Yesterday I tried using it, this time handle does not want to lock to stand still. Overall very cheap construction and has quite a bit of design and operation flaws. I am in the market for a new carpet cleaner, but I don't know which brand/model I will go with this time. Oh well..."
1,Very dissapointed,"Well, the CD title says Hit list, and these songs are hits from 70's and 80's. But Joan Jett couldn't deliver any of these hits as good as it should be, on all songs here, her vocals are very lame & weak. Musicianship sucks, I know Blackhearts can play, but here it's just a dissapointment, maybe, this album is the greatest mistake of Joan Jett & B's career. Avoid this CD."
1,Hit List?,"Very disappointing. I picked this one up expecting a greatest hits compilation but nope that's not what this is. The title is very misleading. If you want Joan's 80's era hits like ""I Love Rock & Roll"" don't look here. Check the imports because apparently Joan's label doesn't want her real hits to be available in the US."
2,Off-Key,"Following the blast of energy that was UP YOUR ALLEY, most Joan Jett fans were a bit rattled to receive this thing from their idol, a covers-collection done without inspiration. ""Dirty Deeds"" proves Jett no longer is in touch with her punky roots(at least the horn section gets cut from the cassette-single mix). ""Time Has Come Today"" is very good, the Kinks' ""Celluloid Heroes"" is well sung, but the new version of ""Roadrunner"" is tired and the Sex Pistols'""Pretty Vacant"" isn't threatening or rebellious--just off-key."
2,joan and her 'covers',this is joan jett singing her favorite'cover'songs. but i do not favor any of these songs as great. the AC/DC cover is worth a One-Time listen. besides that you can throw this in the trash.
3,JOANIE JOANIE JOANIE,"i like everything that JJ puts out,this cd isn't her best, not b/c it is a cover album,but the songs she chose to cover.time has come today is FANTASTIC!!! dirty deeds and have you ever seen the rain are superb!"
2,poor light,it works but don't recommend ..you have to shake it for 5 minutes at least to get a second of light...
4,Early Hardy Charm,"In this early work, Hardy's prevalent themes are already at work. Charming and idyllic compared to his later novels, Hardy's second published novel explores what would become some of his signature explorations - such as the ways in which rustic life clashes against the modern as well as individual vs. societal desires and motivations. Yet, he handles these ideas more whimsically through a love triangle between a school teacher, Fancy Day, Dewy, a town fiddler, and one Mr. Maybold, the vicar. Hardy manages to evoke same beauty and poetry of rustic life and rural settings sans the harsh tragedy. More than a ""lesser"" work as it is sometimes called, I see Under the Greenwood Tree as an emergent work, where we can see Hardy in bud form, with his petals expanding and beginning to bloom. Overall, the tone of the novel is a gentle one but it is not completely free of Hardy's signature melancholy."
4,It is has its place,We do many calculation reports in which we like to add sketches. It is a pain to have to scan and move the files. This makes the process faster. We also take notes of phone calls and such for projects. This product helps keep them all in an electronic folder so when the project is finished we can recycle the paper folder contents.
1,Product failed out of the box - Mfgr unresponsive,"This was a complete waste of money. After installation of the software, the receiver unit was so sensitive it picked up pen movement from 8"" away, causing erratic scratches to interfere w/ writing. Contacted the company and they have not responded after several weeks."
5,Digimemo,The product delivers indicated services. I use it to recored notes so that I remember where they are. Very convenient.
5,"One more day, one more night, one more drink, one more fight.","Its too bad these punks just announced their possible breakup. This band has stood the test of time in Pittsburgh of all cities where Im from and punk rock was so diminished and yuppie rock is on the rise, these crazy mfers hung on and kicked ass everywhere from Pittsburgh to Europe stayin true to their roots of hardcore punk.

1,Winner takes all?,"If you want to be bored to death...well this PPV is for you! The matches were no good.1.Regal vs. Tajiri, terrible short match!2.Battle Royal,stupid and gave away who was going to win main event.3.Womens match, I'm a man so I cant complain!4.Hardys vs. Dudleys in a steel cage, only good match5.Christian vs. Al Snow, give me a break!6.Test vs. Edge, o.k. another good match!7.10-man elimination tag match -- Winner takes all, what a terrible match, like 50 minuts long and just plain boring!If I were you I would go with a PPV like summerslam 2000,Invasion 2001,King of the Ring 2000/2001, or Wrestlemania 16 and 17. If you are planing on buying this PPV I recomend you to not buy!"
5,one of the best of 2001!,"great ppveuro.title:christtian vs. al snow. should have been someone else instead of al snow.4/10tajiri vs. regal. kinda boring.5/10ic/u.s title unifaction match:test vs. edge. great match. non stop action. 10/10tag team title unifaction steel cage match: hardys vs. dudleys. another outstanding match. 10/10imunity battle royal. pretty entertaining match. i thought ddp would win.10/106-pack womens title- i dont want to write down all the names.

2,WWF Survivor Series 2001,1st Match: Christain VS Al Snow *WINNER: Christain2nd Match: Tajiri VS William Regal ****WINNER: William Regal3rd Match: Edge VS Test ***WINNER: Edge4th Match: Hardy Boyz VS Dudley Boyz ***WINNER: Dudley Boyz5th Match: Immunity Battle Royal ****WINNER: Test6th Match: Lita VS Trish VS Jackie VS Molly VS Jazz VS Ivory ***WINNER: Trish StratusMain Event: Team WWF VS Team Alliance *****WINNER: Team WWF
3,Great event,"I was dissapointed that SHANE was eliminated too early. BOOKER T does not deserve to be in longer than SHANE. Shane just did an elbow drop then if I remember 2 - 3 of the WWF do thier big moves to eliminate him ie UNDERTAKES Tombstone pile driver AND CHRIS JERICHOES move(I know SHANE is better out of the ring by using weapons etc). The match is one of the best of the years.All the other matches are good, it depends on how long the match is(regal v tajiri is too short)."
1,how dumb is this,ok the alliance is much better than the wwe. the alliance should of won because now the wwe is losing money because they have no competition why did vince buy wcw in the first place? oh never mind I know because wcw was kicking the wwe's butt.the survivor series 2002 is much better. and new yorkers are lupid
4,survivor series 2001 review,"match ratings out of 51.) christian vs al snow 2/52.) william regal vs tajiri 2.5/53.) edge vs test 3/54.) dudley boyz vs hardy boyz (steel cage match) 3.3/5 (awesome spot at the end of the match)5.) battle royal 2/56.) women's 6 pack challenge 2.5/57.) team wwf vs team wcw 4.5/5overall pretty decent show, worth picking up for the steel cage match and the main event."
5,One of WWE's best PPV's ever!,"I am lucky enough to have this dvd and encourage anyone who liked the ""invasion"" of 2001 or anyone who just liked the good 'ol days of wrestling to buy this. It features funny things like ""Kurt, I can't clean a toilet!"" from Stephanie McMahon to the seriousness that was radienting off of Vicne McMahon as he told Undertaker, Kane, Rock, Jericho and Big Show to go out there and destroy the Alliance...There are also a few entrances, including when ""woooo!"" Ric Flair returned as the owner of Raw and ""Say goodbye to daddy's little girl!"" Overall, it is truly a great buy! I sware to you, you will love this!"
2,Raj Quartet,The books that I was sent were yellowed and musty smelling. Perhaps I should have been warned that the books were so old and were printed so long ago.
4,Good quality,"This set of paperback books was of good quality, in my opinion. The covers are taped, but the interior is intact. I would have preferred hardback editions of The Raj Quartet, but that option was not available."
2,I LOVE Jillian but do not like this video!,"I adore Jillian Michaels and most of her DVDs helped me lose my post prego weight. However, this video is just poor quality. The ""students"" make up their own counts and at times zip through the reps. There is just a bit too much chatting for my taste. The hugging and congratulating at the end of each circuit is very annoying! And no cool down???? Crazy! Not my favorite! I love the other DVDs better!"
3,it's ok,"It will get boring if you do this one more than once every couple of weeks.Like:-personal stories-good excercises-good tips-less repetitions-variety!!!!-it's almost an hour, I think, but goes by quickDon't like:-no backgroudn music at all (which is sad cause it would make it so much more enjoyable!!!)-could seem a bit too long-wish it had more triceps involved"
3,"Great workout, horrible video quality","I bought this as an instant download. The image quality is awful and I have a really nice LCD HDTV, so I know it is not my tv, but awful image quality aside, it is a great workout. I have lost ~30 lbs so far and wanted something more to do at home. My responsibilities between home and work make it hard to get to the gym, so working out at home is ideal."
5,Excellent,I have pretty much every weight loss dvd that Jillian has put out. This one is an excellent starting point. You will really feel these moves the next day.
4,Just okay,"Jullian does a great job showing you how to do the exercises, but I quickly out grew it. It's great for a beginner and who likes to take things slowly."
3,Had to return this item,"It's not the quality of the exercises that is poor, but rather the quality of the video itself. The boring white background and beginner moves aren't for those who've mastered her other videos. Furthermore, as this is a re-release of her older videos, it's not as ""innovative"" as what we've become used to with her other videos. Sorry, Jillian, this one is not for me."
3,A good read but I much prefered her earlier books.,"I very much like Sujata Massey's style, and I am quite taken with her main character Rea Shimura. I also like the views that Massey gives us of Japanese life through the eyes of a Westerner.I felt that this, her third novel, was another pleasureable romp, following Rea as she gets unwillingly involved in and solves yet another mystery.I found, however, that this tale did not fire my interest as her others had. I enjoyed meeting her friends again and watching a new man enter that circle. I liked the insights into Ikebana culture.I only gave it three stars, however, because I felt that the the lengthy build-up led to a surprising but not particularly exciting resolution. As I finally closed the book my feeling was - Okay, hmmm. Nowhere near a Wow!I have no doubt that other readers who, like me, anticipate the latest Massey story will want to read this one. I am just hoping that the next is more gripping, intriquing, moving...."
4,It's always a pleasure to see another book from Ms. Massey.,"Beyond the mysteries in Sujata Massey's books, which are always intriguing, it's wonderful to learn more about Japan through Rei's eyes. It's particularly amusing for me to get Rei's perspective--Rei, who's a Japanese-American woman living in Japan--on Westerners who come to work/visit Japan and can't even be bothered to learn to say the simplest of Japanese words. Loved the ""gardener"" and hope to see more. Readers for whom The Flower Master is their introduction to Ms. Massey should not miss The Salaryman's Wife and Zen Attitude."
4,Another fun read,"Massey isn't Mosely, but her books are great in a different way. Massey books are just plain fun. Her books are perfect for plane rides, the beach, or anywhere you just want an entertaining, light read. (If Hollywood hasn't already optioned her books, they really should.) I discovered A Salaryman's Wife last year, and felt guilty about liking it so much. Zen Attitude lived up as a sequel, and her last book, The Flower Master, is just as good.I can't wait to read her next book..."
1,Not worth the time or money,"This product is awful. If you enjoy spending money on something and getting no use out of it, this grill is for you. Otherwise, DO NOT BUY IT!!! I could not get the coals to light and without hot coals, the product is useless. I bought this to use for tailgating at a football game and thankfully I was able to use someone else's grill to cook my food. I will never think about buying this product again."
2,Grill-n-Go Must Go!,We tried the Grill-n-Go to make things easier when we go camping. We found that it was not worth it at all. The grill never got hot enough to cook anything and it left a bad taste on the meat we were cooking. We ended up putting tin foil over our camp fire and finishing cooking that way. The Grill-n-Go seemed like a great idea but it turned out to be a waste of time and money. Would not buy this product again. I give it two stars for a decent idea and the ability to throw it away.
1,Useless,"This thing is useless. Charcoal doesn't light. Do not buy this piece of junk. Amazon, get rid of this product! Get yourself a cheap portable grill and a bag of instant-light charcoal for about $20 total. It would be reusable and you wouldn't be wasting your hard-earned money."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This product does not work at all, it's more worth in to throw your dollar bill in to start the grill."
3,"Not good, not bad. Definitely worth a rental","I rented this movie not too long ago and found it somewhat amusing. It is NOT overly violent but there is some. Disgust is more the feeling one gets from viewing this film.I would most certainly not recommend anyone purchasing this movie but if you have almost two and a half hours to kill and want to watch a movie worth renting (ONLY), then you could do a LOT worse. I have stumbled upon some real losers on Amazon by way of rentals and this movie in no way compares to the majority of those awful films. Whatever you do, ignore people like me and their reviews. Nine times out of ten the reviewers are either mentally ill or wouldn't recognize a good movie if it bit them on the backside.Regardless, now after asking for you to ignore my review I would suggest this movie as a rental only. One thing is for certain, it is fimed beautifully!"
5,Special Order Away -- It's Worth It,"J.R. Monterose is fantastic tenor player who unfortunately is under-recorded and underappreciated. His biggest claim to fame was playing on Mingus' Atlantic debut ""Pithecanthropus Erectus,"" and he also recorded a wonderful self-titled album for Blue Note (now oop on CD). This album features 5 Monterose orginals and two standards, and they are all awesome. Tommy Flanagan, whom he recorded with again in the 70s, knows just where to lead and follow Monterose. The quartet is completed by Jimmy Garrison and Pete LaRoca, both making early recorded appearences here. Just the personnel alone intrigued me enough to buy it, but the music is what keeps it in heavy rotation on my CD player."
3,okay,it worked well and smelled good. the only thing i didnt like was that you have to use it on dry skin because its not oily it was alittle rough and takes some getting use to.
5,Absolutely amazing!,"This book is one of the best books I have read. It was touching and made me realise what an amazing life Saira Shah has led. After I closed the book, I could not pick up annother book for a couple of days - I did not want to spoil the feeling it had left me with. This book will move you, make you think and touch you.I loved it!"
2,Unfortunately this writer's not a good storyteller,"The writer's father and other ancestors may be good writers or storytellers, but Saira Shah certainly isn't. This book is a unstructured enumeration of detailed events during the writer's travels to her home country, but it lacks to give the larger picture the reader is looking for. Events or stories described in the book sometimes just span 1 sentence or 1 paragraph. Everytime I asked myself: ""what was the point of writing this ?"". I was also hoping to get a better insinght in the regions past and present, and the book almost failed completely. It's arrogant to call this book ""memoirs"" when the writer was barely 35 or 40 (my best guess) when she wrote it. There's just not enough substance and the reader leaves the book with a great hunger. The editors have done a bad job coaching the writer and editing the book."
1,"""read like fiction"" is a good way to put it....","Bad bad bad. Thankfully, I didn't pay for it and just took it out of the library. Over the top, unrealistic, just plain silly. AS IF a man who was head of security wouldn't have videotaped what she was doing....either to show to her or to show to authorities. I couldn't finish the book, it was that bad, but at the point I stopped reading, his wife supposedly STILL didn't even know she was doing this (all but said ""where am I?"" when she came out of her trance)."
1,I can't believe how bad this book is...,"I have read ""the blanket she carried"" and I can't believe that anyone would take the time to actually finish this jumbled up piece of crap.In my opinion the whole book was just thowed together with no real point to it.It is amazing that it was ever published!"
5,"he who hath ears,let him hear.","Matt Pike just left our home.I bought one of his GREEN amplifiers from him.Coolest regular guy you'll ever meet.Yet, the guy is a guitar genius.A riff master who's record, JERUSALEM, is, in my opinion an absolute classic.A totally original idea that goes completely against the grain.Originally picked up and than foolishly fumbled by LONDON records.It is now available.Anyone who wants to know what it sounds like when a new musical genre is born-get this cd."
4,Sleep,"I love Sleep and the whole ""stoner rock"" genre. This isn't a CD u can just walk into say a Best Buy and find. I gave it a 4 star rating because I thought the audio could have been remastered better, but if u love the band I would recommend."
4,go ahead and buy dopesmoker,"I love this cd. If you like stoner rock at all, you should love it too. BUT, go ahead and buy dopesmoker cause its the longer version. Heavy as a bathtub full of concrete. peace"
3,"Stoned again, no doubt","Definately falls short of ""Holy Mountain"" and ""Volume 1"". ""Jerusalem"" is very monotonous and always in the same key of D, which is like most other Sleep but they just don't do something right this time. One dissapointment is the singing. He sounds more like a Bhuddist monk chanting the same thing over and over again every song. If you are a die hard Sleep fan you will probably enjoy it. I just can't listen to it every day like I did when ""Holy Mountain"" came out."
2,A Better Title for this Release Would Be:,"The Bridge of Khazad-dm, Balrog, Hammer and Anvil, or Ragnarok. Listen to the recording and you'll understand why I say this. The persistent ""DOOM"" . . . ""DOOM"" . . . ""DOOM"" sound that repeats over and over again with very little variation gets old after about part 3 halfway into the song. Ambitious? Not really. You are much better off getting Sleep's Holy Mountain."
2,One not for about 40 of the 52 minutes,"I was really dissapointed in this album because I have heard some of their other stuff and its really good. When I put the CD on I expected it to go somewhere but it didn't, its just the same note plucked over and over again with some riffs once in a while (including one that is the iron man riff almost note for note). I would just recommend hearing this before you buy it."
1,Complete Letdown,"What is supposed to be some kind of lofty concept - the one song record - really amounts to a pile of pointless noise when executed with such indifference and utter contempt for anything resembling songwriting. To compare this with the brilliantly doomy ""Holy Mountain"" would be wickedly cruel, but I have no other choice. Sleep crashed and burned HARD on this one, and it seems obvious to me that their obessive fixation with pot has apparently destroyed every remaining brain cell in the band.Thumbing one's nose at convention is great if you can back it up, but these ridiculously long and moronic riffs are less exciting than watching a band tune their guitars. I don't understand how a band can go from ""Holy Mountain"" to this piffle! It is a great tragedy they will have to fight hard to escape, but they won't because they will end up face down in a bag of pot before they ever have a chance to strap on guitars again. And I can't say that I will care."
3,what?,"One song records are not even close to being original, unless your stuck back in the 40's; though I'm not saying they are bad ideas."
1,Sabbath abortion,"Don't let me be misunderstood - I love it. I really enjoyed it. I am really impressed - look, you really need to be something - to pinch ONE RIFF from Sabbath and to cut the whole album out of it!As for being sooo HEAVY - for the starters why don't you try Swans (Children of God/World of Skin; then Laibach -Opus Dei, and EarthThe Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull. I think we'd better forget this nonsence about ""doom"", ""stoner"" - the guys were just learning how to play Sabbath, and in this effort they failed to come even close to the first tribute band -IRON CLAW - IRON CLAW(which started in 1969). On the other hand, when it comes to spending your hard-earned cash, try first exceptional contemporaries: AmericanRide Satan Ride - O.S.T.andBattle of Old Crowplus CanadianBlood Ceremony,Living With the Ancients, even honest Swedish imitators -Witchcraft (Reis)- sound more convincing."
2,aaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh,"You would have to be on some heavy and serious dosages of some dangerously mind-warping substances in order to understand and enjoy this piece of ""ART"" as some stoner boneheadz would refer to this. As others put it, it's repetative and droning numbness and you would need to be very patient for an hour just to scratch the surface on this one.Not really for me - I prefer bands like ORANGE SUNSHINE, HIGH RISE, SPIRITUAL BEGGARS, THE QUILL, ETERNAL ELYSIUM, ATOMIC BITCHWAX and their ilk."
1,smoke what bongzilla is smoking,"...What we have with this disk is about 3 or 4 chords played over and over and over. Each song doesn't sound like the last song...IT IS THE LAST SONG! ...Hey, i think i made something like this on my 4-track once. If I dig it out, all you good people can buy it from me. For about the first 5 minutes i was pretty cool with this but then i started getting that feeling...like an oh oh type of deal. Yes, its actaully a 45 minute track or so of the absolute same stuff with no changes. And it gets mighty boring. Some might say thats the point of it all..to lull you into a trance... Steer clear of this. A better example of this type of music would be Bongzilla. At least they bring some music with their [items]."
5,Just wonderful!,"Very nice carving set, knife glides effortlessly through all sorts of meats. Have used it on roasted chicken and standing rib roast. Nice job"
4,Good book,"This is a very good book. The author tells the stories and helps readers make the connections between the stories of Narnia and Christianity in a very clear and concise manner. For very young children, however, I recommend Kenneth McIntosh's Finding Aslan: A Book of Devotions for Children Based Upon the Chronicles of Narnia. They complement each other well."
3,"If this is your favorite book, please keep reading!!!!","I keep reading Ms Hill's books because some of them are very good and I don't want to miss a good one. BUT while this is a fairly smooth read it is not a fun one. Lexie is more courageous and eloquent than some of her predecessors in that she does stand up to her sister but this book reminds me of the Proverb ""better to live on the rooftop than in a house of a contentious woman"" ,I hope I quoted that right but you get my meaning. The sister nags and complains the whole way through the book. It is painful!"
1,Leaking Tank ALSO!!!!,"The water bladder tank leaked and the brush assembly hopped. I called Bissell, they apologized and sent out another tank. The second tank arrived 10 days later, it leaked also; so I returned the cleaner where I purchased it.The dual tank seemed a good idea until I used it. I was dumping a lot of clean hot water down the drain. It was nearly impossible to get the carpet shed/fuzz out of the tank because you cannot remove the clean water bladder. I also was not fond of the idea that the brushes did not rotate without the suction. Some spots need to be scrubbed more than others and I found that I used more cleaning solution and water than was necessary because I could not just brush the area without removing the cleaning solution.Extremely frustrating. I am searching for a cleaner without belts and separate tanks."
3,"Great cleaning, but durability needs work!","This cleaner worked great for about 2 years. (10 uses) I have three kids and one cat. Then I noticed the upright lock pedal was not working and then the next time I used it, the cleaner wouldn't spray water. (it would only suck if you poured water on the floor) I took it to a vaccuum repair center and he showed me where the problem was. He said there is a design flaw that allows the screws in the top casing to strip over time (machine too heavy) and this in turn, breaks the suction from the water tank to the valve on the base. He said it was not worth fixing and that the pumps were also common to stop working. So, I got out the Gorilla Glue and glued the top to the base and secured the screws with glue. At least for the time being, the cleaner is working again."
4,Good CD but missing some of the essential Chopin Music,"This CD is a very good start for anyone that's not familiar with Chopin's music. It includes about every facet of his work, including a sonata, a ballade, mazurkas, polonaises etc... But no nocturnes? And not even one movement of a piano concerto? And only one impromptu? Also, there are a little too much mazurkas on the CD. Aside from these defects, the CD really is a great buy."
4,Addie and the King of Hearts,"I rememberthese books fondly from my elementary school days and have been trying andtrying to remember the book titles so that I can read them again and share them with my own girls!Addie and the King of Hearts by Gail Rock is one in the series of books (I think there are four in all) about Addie Mills, a young girl coming of age in . This book is about her discovering the true meaning of love as the school dance is approaching and she tries to be sophisticated to impress her teacher (7th grade I think). It is a very real and honest and touching book and I highly recommend it."
4,The Glass Castle,"This book is easy to read, but difficult to experience. I could not help but be angry at these parents for the abuse they heaped on their children. On the other hand some of their child rearing philosophy should be required reading for today's young parents.They seemed to enable the children to strive for their best potential, and under very trying cicumstances grow up without turning bitter.The prose is accomplished and completely without rancor. However given the first chapter's scene of Jeanette's glimpse of the bag-lady/mother and Maureen's eventual breakdown you realize that these people all paid a price for their childhood experinces. I would recommend this book to readers who can put aside their distaste at some of the suffering that is revealed by the writer."
5,The Glass Castle: A Memoir,"The book was well written and an easy read. It tells us Jeannette Walls' growing up years in poverty, and then her move to NYC."
4,A book that stays with you after the reading....,"This book was both hard to read and hard to put down, and even after it is finished, I find myself thinking about it. Jeannette Walls writes so well.She put me in her shoes throughout the book, and what I felt was the younger children's complete trust in the parents and the later turn as the children grew older and the parents' disintegrated. I was so angry at the parents throughout...I couldn't wait to see how the kids would get out, or if they all would survive. It is the power of the three older kids to stick together and pull each other out of the mess their parents had made that is the miracle of the story. It speaks to the toughness of love and family in a way that a more conventional ""growing up"" memoir cannot. Bravo to you, Jeannette Walls."
4,"""The Glass Castle"" book",The book was very well written & I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is NOT a fast read because virtually every sentence is very detailed. I will buy her other book & believe I will enjoy it just as much.
1,Fabricated,"This is a good work of fiction being pass off as truth. A 3 yr old does not have the kind of recall that Jeanette seems to have. I'm sure the book was based on some truth but remember, she made her living as a gossip columnist in New York City. She knows what to write to capture an audience and sell her book!"
3,doesn't live up to the hype,"I've read many ""look at my terrible childhood"" memoirs and this one reads like all the rest. This book came highly recommended to me by friends and I'm sad to say it wasn't worth the time - or the money."
3,Sad-Sad-Sad,It is so hard to believe that they lived like that. Sad family life and poor parenting. Great opportunities lost due to alcohol influences. I could not finish the book as it was so depressing.
2,Very depressing,"I know this is on the best seller list, but this book was very disturbing to me. I did not like it!"
4,Insightful,"This book was often difficult to read. However, I don't think I'll look at the people I see living on the streets as I did before. She did a very good job sharing her life with us."
5,The Glass Castle,"Love Jeanette Walls style of writing. I couldn't put it down once I started reading, and I wish it could've kept going after I finished it. I'm now reading her 2nd book, Half Broke Horses - already proving to be just as good!"
4,A Beautiful Read,"I loved this book. Well written and captured the authors childhood in a most eloquent way. While keeping it through the eyes of a child, she remained optomistic through the entire book. Not pittying her self in the least. she also did not blame anyone which i found quite interesting. she loved her parents in spite of thier dysfunction and neglect. And, it appears she still loves them dearly while not letting them drag her up and down emotionally...im sure she has had to deal with a lot of dissapointment...and needed a lot of therapy.Great Book!"
5,A Good Read!,"I bought this book for my mother who is a prolific reader.She has without exaggeration read thousands of books in her very long lifetime. She knows well written books when she finds them.She first read Jeanette Wall's book, Half Broke Horses and really loved it.I ordered Wall's memoir ""The Glass Castle"" for her, hoping she wouldn't be disappointed. She was NOT! She loved it!Don't hesitate to buy it! A good read!"
5,5 stars,Couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book. Hard to believe that children can grow up in such an environment and still become achievers.
3,Issues with the narrator,"I decided to try to listen to this book on cd. BAD idea. I just found out the author is the narrator, which makes it even more sad. I couldn't stand it! It sounded like a robot with intonations in all the wrong places. Which is really sad because Walls isn't an actress, she is a writer, someone should have stopped her. I LOVED reading Half Broke Horse, and was planning on loving this one just as much, but that voice!! So I am going to get the book from my library and finish it and enjoy it, I hope."
4,"Hard to believe it's entirely true, but still a fantastic story regardless.","I'd give this one 4.5 stars if I could. I loved this read and it was perfect for book club. The story will stay with you for a long time. Although the scenery is dark, the characters warm and enlighten you."
2,Didn't like it but glad I read it.. I guess.,"The Glass Castle evoked in me a strange phenomenon. I can't say that I liked this book, but at the same time, I could not put it down. I had to get to the end to see how the events of the book affected the main character's current life. However, throughout the reading process, I was frustrated and angry. How could parents like Walls' be so oblivious to the suffering of their children and not do anything about it. Reading this book was an emotional roller coaster- mostly of negative emotions. Through the pitfalls, though, the story was eye-opening to a lifestyle I've had no exposure to (thank goodness). As an educator, it was enlightening to think about the kinds of students that might be sitting in my classroom and the lives they may be trying to run away from. Be prepared to be angry and unsatisfied if you choose to sit down with this book."
5,Un real,Its unreal how people can survive and still be successful. The desire to be better and the need for change can inspire people to grow and move on. Great story!
4,"""What were her parents thinking?!""","That was my on-going reaction to this auto-biographical piece by Jeannette Walls. Growing up in the same time period (circa the 1960's), and seeing some of the same kinds of folk around, was very familiar and a little harrowing - seeing what some of my contemporaries may have been enduring without me ever knowing. I read it as a follow-up to Ms. Walls' Half Broke Horses (a 'real-life novel' as she calls it). I enjoyed Half Broke Horses and expected this to be much the same, but it didn't have the same impact or draw that the previous book had."
4,A Disturbing Memoir,"I can't say that I really ""enjoyed"" this book, but I did find it highly interesting. I thought the author did an excellent job of chronicling her bizarre and troubling childhood, but I found her almost wooden narrative a little disturbing. The book seems to be written in more of a detached, biographical style, rather than autobiographical, with a glaring lack of emotion. I found myself wishing time and again that Jeannette would just bust loose and scream and yell...or something. Perhaps my own less traumatic childhood prevents me from truly understanding the effects this type of neglect and abuse has on a person's psyche, and what it takes to survive it. In any event, The Glass Castle sheds light on a side of child abuse that too often is ignored - that is the abuse of children who are being raised by mentally ill parents. Definitely worth the read."
4,Amazing!,I just finished this book on Friday.I had it for a while but i heard that its about a sad story so I waited. I must say i was surprised by how well written this book is. It kept me interested and locked and i could not believe that there are parents who would do something like that. Especially her mother freaked me out with her art supplies.Unbeleavable. SHe is very brave and she tells the story without trying to make people feel sorry for her situation.It must have been hard to write this in the first place. I can say*applause* Jeannette Walls did a great job.
5,A Must Read,This is one of the best stories I have ever read. Amazing. Inspiring. Tragic. Comic. Heartwarming.
3,Too real,"What a sad life for people to have lived through, I know her mother tried hard, but, it is too bad people have to experience this in their lives"
3,Good book overall,I thought this was a fascinating story of hardship through the view of an impoverished child. Kept my interest the whole way through...but the ending left much to be desired. Extremely anticlimactic.
3,The Glass Castle,It was condition was Ok -- the book was a wonderful life changing book -- will loan it to my children & grandchildren when they think they have it bad
4,Amazingly sad and angry,"If you like being pissed off for 90% of the book, then this is the book for you. Now it should should be Said, that Mrs. Walls does pull it out by the end, but the bulk of the book is devastating. She journals her upbringing by her free spirited artist mother and alcoholic father. A tough life to say the least. If you think your upbringing was tough, read this. Chances are you life ain't so bad. Ultimately, Janet comes full circle with her parents and lives to tell the tale.I was so mad at her parents, but I couldn't put it down. I read this over three days and at the time I was working 12 hour days. Reader beware, you may be hooked..."
5,An All Time Favorite of an Avid Reader,One of my all time favorite reads ... and it's a short list. Love it! Love it! Love it!Aberrations
5,Just read it!,"I can't recommend this book enough. Jeannette Walls had a one-of-a-kind upbringing, and the way she writes about it, without a trace of self-pity, is equally astonishing. This book is a classic page-turner, and one of my all-time favorites. A must-read."
5,Amazing Story: The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls,This truly remarkable story is written in a style that will keep the reader interested and captivated throughout the entire book. It was literally one of those books that I could not put down.
5,Family Story,They had a very dramatic childhood which should make every reader more appreciative of their own parents. It does show that despite its flaws the familly still manages to pull together to help one another. I guess it is true that love covers a multitude of sins.
5,Delightful reading experience,"A fascinating book that is interesting, fast moving and very well written. All the characters are down to earth, which we can relate to. The memoir style of writing is impressive. The book is not much about the success one achieves, but the obstacles they overcome. ""The Glass Castle"" is an inspirational book with great lessons.[...]"
5,fabulous,This is a beautiful story of victory when you have come from dreadful circumstances. I really did love it and have now her other book Half Broken horse
5,Good Reading!,"This book is hard to put down, you always want to know what happens next...good writing and reading! Getting next book soon..."
5,The Glass Castle- by Jeannette Walls,"This is the best book I've read in a long time- Jeannette Walls has a moving story to tell, which she does with insight and humor. Her most recent book, ""Half Broke Horses"", the true story of her grandmother, is also a jewel. I saw Walls at the Miami Book Fair in November- she was quite inspiring, (and funny!), and she received a standing ovation after her presentation."
5,Great Book,At the beginning the story is too extreme to be true. Jeannette discribes her mom rooting trash cans for living and about she got burned when she was 3 when cooking hotdogs. My niece is 6 and she is not allowed anywhere near the oven. I was not convinced and doubtful about the honesty of the memoir. But gradually knowing more about the mom and dad the story makes total sense. And it was a great story. I laughed and cried. And I am learning from that. Thank you Jeannette.
4,Beutifully written,"I am still having a hard time to believe how she survived growing up in such a conditions.Nevertheless, this is one kind of book about survival and its written beautifully with wonderful memories.This is one of the book that I will keep for my collection."
4,Triumph Over Adversity,"So many people have trials that the rest of us don't understand. I was raised in a ""normal"" home with good solid parents. My love of my live was not. Her dad was solid; her mother bi-polar. I have tried for 30 years to understand what life was like for my love growing up. This book delves into what is reality for far to many people who struggle with keeping their own sanity while dealing with a nut case parent. Very interesting and very real. A good read. Far too true!"
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,"The Glass Castle was a book I couldn't put down. I alternated crying and laughing out loud while reading. Rex and Rose Mary Walls were never cut out to be parents, and they did a tremendous amount of damage to the kids, but the positive gifts that Rex gave to his children when he was sober and loving and acting responsible, were things that most kids will never experience in their lives- EVER. I felt jealous of that. I wish them all well, admire them for surviving, and would love to see Rose Mary's art collection! I hope it is made into a movie!"
3,Not bad but...,"... but as a memoir it can't quite rise to the level of McCourt's Angela's Ashes or Hickam's Rocket Boys. It's interesting, in a drive-by look at an auto wreck sort of way, but the style and lyrical drive of the two aforementioned memoirs just isn't there. Not that it's not interesting. It is, it held my attention, and I felt sorry for the little girl and her siblings and came to detest her charming monster of a father. I'm glad Mrs. Walls got to grow up and be a success as a gossip-writer and now write this memoir. The funny thing is I bet her mother would consider this memoir the worse kind of gossip, too."
4,Survival of the Fittest,"I purchased ""The Glass Castle"" by Jeanette Walls at Amazon.com to read for a book discussion group. I did not know what to expect.Each page was more disturbing than the next. It is a tribute to some of these children that they were able to survive and even thrive in these living conditions. It is true that some parents take a completely opposite approach to child rearing which can also be quite destructive. This book can serve as a springboard for discussion on how to bring out the best in your children without scarring them (or the reader) emotionally for life."
4,Interesting Book!,This was bought for my son's Summer Reading at Akron University. I read a couple of pages when it came in the mail----needless to say I never put it down! How this family survived through unreal circumstances was truly heartwarming and horrifying all at the same time.
4,Awesome,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It reads very easily, and keeps the readers' interest. It really opens the reader's mind to what parents are capable of doing to their children. Walls has done well for herself, despite the extreme adversity she faced in this memoir."
1,I was disappointed.,"I got this book and was very disappointed. Although I was sympathetic towards the children, I couldn't help but wondering what was wrong with the parents and why weren't the parents eventually committed."
2,Pure Baloney,"I am just amazed as I sit here and read the reviews for this book. I am finding it hard to belive that many of the things in this book really happened. I am sure that they lived in poverty, and things were extremely rough. That the parents were not comventional parents, and that the children were actually more adult and responsible than their parents. That the parents were so immature or had mental illness was very evident. I just felt like I was reading one of those fishing stories, where the fish just keeps getting larger. It was intersting that this book was paired with ""A Million Little Pieces"" another memoir based on exageration."
1,Just Awful,"I am so sorry to say that this book is terrible, but it truly is. If I could have given it zero stars, I would have. The entire time I was reading it I just kept comparing it to Frank McCourt's truly wonderful and exceptional book, Angela's Ashes. I came away from The Glass Castle thinking that although quite a few people have had some trying experiences in life, only a true storyteller can turn that into a memoir, something worth sharing. Walls remains superficial and timid in her writing. She makes none of her characters even the least bit likeable and stays in this droning adult-trying-to-sound-like-a-child-voice throughout the entire book. Very dissappointing. It could have been so much better had Walls been a true storyteller instead of just a journalist and to do that you need to dig a little deeper, be a bit more vulnerable and true."
1,I guess I don't get it.,"As a person, Jeannette Walls has accomplished a lot. Good for her. However, I didn't like the book. Maybe it was overhyped. As a person who came from a rough childhood, I say, ""So what?"" I didn't feel it was well written. There was no flow and nothing that compelled me to keep reading. And how does she skip over two marriages? The husbands were barely mentioned. It only became remotely interesting toward the end, when I tried to figure out who was mentally ill and who was just codependent."
1,Not much value here,A friend recommended this book. Hard to believe anyone would read this. I found very little value here and skimmed the last 2 chapters just to finish and find value - found none.
5,A Book Against Which I'll Measure ALL Future Books,"Initially, I was adverse to reading this book. My girlfriend recommended it and I don't think we generally share the same tastes in books. However, I was desperate for a book once going through the airport, saw it, bought it, read it, and LOVED IT!!! The story is one of the most interesting I've ever heard. I found myself thinking, ""This kind of &*%$ doesn't REALLY happen, does it???"". I was amazed more than once reading this book.Also, because I'm a fairly slow reader, I pick my books carefully and have never re-read any book. This one, however, deserves another read for sure.I'm afraid I'll never find another book that measures up. There is one, however, that I loved nearly as much,Replay, which is Fiction and unlike any other story I've ever heard."
5,The Glass Castle,Wonderful reading. It is hard to believe this young women could endure life's many hardships and yet mature into a lovely and successful writer. A must read!!
4,A real eyeopener,"I thought I knew what poverty looked like. The narrative of The Glass Castle stirred my own memories of childhood and the sixth grade and a girl named Alice. I'd forgotten how threadbare her clothing was, how her skin was darkened by soot and dirt. I'd forgotten how invisible she was. Yet she was bright and cheerful and never complained of her lot in life. When the school bus would drop her off in front of that dilapidated shack she called home, I found myself wondering how anyone could live like that. Apparently, my Alice was lucky. If this book does not stir your soul to do better by other people, then you are not human."
4,The story develops slowly in the middle.,"I would give the introduction and the end a deserved 5 stars, but the middle part is kind of boring (I would give it only 2 stars). I almost stopped reading it because it felt like she was describing her poverty over and over again. However, I kept reading and I am happy I did. The story is great, and it is a good book that would have been awesome if written a little better in the middle. It shows that with hard work you can reach your goals. It helps you to appreciate what you got.I would definitely recommend it."
4,The Glass Castle,"After reading the first few pages, I couldn't believe a family actually lived like this. Boy, am I naive! An easy read and I had a hard time putting it down. As a parent myself, it was unbelievable what the children had to endure. By books end, I felt such admiration for those children and disdain for their parents."
4,Wonderful Read,"I've been reading a lot of memoirs lately and this has become on of my favorites. She's got a great story, but most importantly: she knows how to tell it - she's a great writer. It was hard to put this book down; she had me on the opening line and didn't let go until close to the end.I've seen a few reviewers here criticize the empathy she shows for her parents - well, that's exactly what makes this such an interesting read. It's hard to communicate a complicated love that survives even the most tragic neglect and abuse depicted in this book, but she manages to tell her story without being overly critical of her parents or outright stating her feelings about them. It all just comes through in the writing, which is a pleasure.I would have given five stars but I felt like the last chapter was sort of rushed and lacking, compared to the rest of the book. Still, this is one of the best-written and most compelling memoirs I've read in a long time. I'd highly suggest getting a copy."
4,Amazing book,This story is simply amazing. Jeannette Walls’ story is something that has to be read to believe. The story of her childhood shows that even if you have a bad childhood you can still be anything that you want to be. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is planning on dealing with children; it helps show you that some children have to deal with a lot. The sad part is that if one child goes through this then it is very likely that there are more out there that are having similar experiences that we don’t know about.
4,Good book,Couldn't put it down. Book was a nice quick read. Enjoyed it very much! Will consider reading more of her books in the future.
5,Oh My Goodness!,I purchased this book in audio & listened to it in my car. I loved it!!! I then purchased this book for a friend as a gift. If you like listening to a tale of growing up in the 60's (which I do) this book is for you! These are parents that you love to hate! It also has a very touching ending! Very well written!!!
4,What does not kills us makes us stronger.,I had no idea that a family could live like this and yet become successful. Very eye opening to a different life style.
5,eye opening,"Short & sweet, it was very easy to care about the outcome of Jeannette from the very beginning. And it's even easier to recall her story and see certain people who you come across everyday in a different light. I appreciate her honesty and the fact she is brave enough to share her 1st hand account of such a life. A book that'll keep you wondering what'll happen next."
4,Don't miss,"This is my first whispersync book. I loved being able to listen when I am cleaning the house, etc. and then when I am going to bed at night, I can read the same book I have been listening to and not have to read something different.The Glass Castle was a interesting read. I appreciated the insight it gave into understanding other lifestyles and about overcoming obstacles. It made me sad for what some kids in this world face."
5,Grabs you from the first page,"Couldn't put it down and was sad when it finished. Very well written, and very easy to get into - grabs you from the first page"
5,So good.,"Read this book in one sitting. Absolutely could not put it down.Jeanette's description of her upbringing left me contemplating the importance of basic life joys: What all do we really need to be happy? How can we simplify? Where do we really learn life's most important lessons?This book will take you from tears to laughs and back to tears, but the whole ride is completely eye opening and gripping."
5,"Thoughtful, insiteful, heartbreaking, brave book","The Glass Castle hit close to home for me. I grew up poor with a mentally ill mother and alcoholic father; who died from alcoholism. I know what it is like to be dirt poor, hungry, have lice and tapeworms. I was saved at 10 by wonderful foster parents. Jeanette Walls book was actually healing for me. Her family and what the children came out of was with such courage and spunk. Her parents molded them; even though it was a disfunctional but loving family in their own way. I realized in me, my past has made me a stonger person too.Thank you for a wonderful, enlightening special book."
3,How does author condone parent's behavior,"I like the book. It was a well written compelling story. The author tells the story of her childhood and seems to glorify her parents horrific behavior (not providing food for kids, bringing them to toxic relatives, etc). I understand that most people would not want to read a book about someone being a victim and blaming their parents but this book seems to celebrate the parents being grossly inadequate. Somehow or another the author and the two older siblings grow up and manage to function in society. But the youngest sibling Maureen seems to take the blunt of the family's disfunction. I am sure if she were to write a memoir she would not be celebrating the parents this way."
5,The best memoir I've ever read.,"It made me laugh, cry and get angry. I loved this book not only for the insight into the pain of childhood, but for the way it made me evaluate my own role as a parent. I could not put this book down and have recommended it to many, many people."
3,Clear-eyed portrayal of a rough upbringing,"In this book, Walls writes about her upbringing at the hands of eccentric, nomadic parents. Her mother is a potentially-crazy mother, and her father is an alcoholic. Walls, along with her brother and two sisters, was left largely to her own devices. Walls' removed, nonjudgmental voice is the only thing that saves this book from typical, sappy sentimentality. I found many parts of the story to be cliched, including many of Walls' reactions to her life circumstances."
5,Loved it,"I loved this book ...It was a quick and easy read because every page was enthralling. The author relates a horrific upbringing in a matter of fact manner with no self pity whatsoever. Ultimately, it is a very uplifting book, with the message that one can rise above terrible experiences and still have a sane, happy existence. It is a testament to the resiliency of the human spirit."
5,Excellent,I simply love it! This is a kind of book what you start read and you can not stop until finish.
4,An intriguing autobiography,This book is a great read. The life Jeanette Walls lived as a child makes for quite interesting fare. It is hard to believe that children were allowed such freedom. At times this posed great danger to the children and at times it provided interesting life lessons. Her parents were truly unique characters.... often totally irresponsible and yet fiercely loving. I would highly reccommend this book.
5,My Favorite Summer Read,"As a college student, my opportunities for pleasure reading are few. Each summer, I take the chance to read as many books as possible. ""The Glass Castle"" was one of my recent choices, and left a powerful impression on me.The family described in this book is far from perfect, but I felt drawn to the delightfully flawed characters. The author does not attempt to transmit ""perfect family morals."" She just gives artistic and detailed descriptions of her life as a child. The experiences shared are real and raw and endearing.It has been said that you can ""never go home again."" I know that after reading this memoir, I will never go home to my old ideas about family and life."
5,Great book!!!,This book was great!! I highly recommend it to others!! I was glued to it and couldn't put it down! Great job Jeannette Walls!
4,Great book!,"This book is fantastic! The author, along with her siblings, has lived a truly unique life. Some might say her parents were unfit, but Wells certainly does not dwell on that. Instead, her mother made running from the police and leaving their home at the drop of a hat sound like an adventure. A great read!"
5,10 STARS!!!,"I cannot stop thinking about this book. In fact, I think I may just read it all over again! I absolutely loved this book. Jeannette's account of her childhood is absolutely amazing and inspiring. This book has affected me profoundly."
3,Far Fetched,"Most of this book seemed fiction, not reality. Really far fetched that a young child of three through eight or nine would remember such details such as the color of the sky and where the clouds were and detailed descriptions of how the trees looked. I mean, come on! Three stars for a fictional read. I am amazed at all the rave reviews."
3,Really?,"Literature it isn't. The Glass Castle IS a compelling memoir in its own way yet almost totally unbelievable. It's like Angela's Ashes all over again, and that wasn't true either. Maybe I'm just becoming more cynical in my old age, but I just don't buy it."
2,C fifty highlighted Dr gh,Dr f2f hi hi f2f x f2f BBC guy hugged Ghana UN v c f2f thgghhjjhgff f2f hitchhiking :) ff
2,Disappointing and under developed,"The first page turned me off, but I continued to read in hopes the author would develop her voice and make me feel something for her, her situation, her family- really anything. It just never happened. She may be a wonderful journalist, but a memoir shouldn't be written in such a removed voice. Even the ending didn't make me feel anything but frustrated. If the quality of the writing was better, I could at least think about the book as literature, but it is not worthy of it."
1,Depressing,"I feel bad that Jeanette Walls had such a terrible childhood. Mine wasn't the best either, so perhaps that is why I have put the book aside before I finished it."
1,glass castle,I bought this book more that a week ago and still have not recieved book. I will miss book club this month. oh well.
5,Amazing story--quick read as you can't put it down,"As the story continues, you wonder ""Did this really happen?"" ""How could this have happened?"" ""I hope this didn't happen."" It is truly amazing how a person can come out of that chaotic life as a well-rounded successful woman. God Bless You Jeannette!"
4,well written memoir,"An interesting and seemingly sincere account of a child raised by intelligent but deeply troubled parents,Ms. Walls was able to overcome her past & raise herself to become a success."
1,The Glass Castle: A memoir,"People do not have recall back to three years old like this author seems to think she does. I can't even finish the first chapter, let alone trying to get through the whole book."
1,Not that interesting or extraordinary,"What was that? Her life was not that interesting or extraordinary. People with really boring lives, absolutely no creativity and no sense of adventure probably rated this book highly. I am happy she pulled herself out of a nosedive."
1,can't believe this is a bestseller!!,"Can't believe this book is on the bestseller list...what do so many people think is so great about it?? Whats happening to people's taste in literature these days?? There is no way this is a true life story, little children don't talk, act and remember details like she's written and the parents just can not be that neglectful but quirky and smart at the same time. I don't buy it and you should not buy it either (the book)."
2,Not Enjoying,This book is the most unbelievable book I have ever read. Every other page has a living condition or situation that is not possible. I find it incredulous that so many people didn't see through this blatant so called non fiction. It's definitely listed in the wrong category.
2,Based on a true story,"This ""memoir"" read like a novel and I would have enjoyed it had it been presented that way. But I can't stand being duped. I have no doubt the author encountered her share of human suffering, but her incredibly vivid and descriptive writing style made me doubt her credibility. I smell a rat, and not the one living in the Wall's sugar bowl."
1,A Poor Work of Fiction,"Truly a work of fiction; and, a very poor one at that. It is a sad commentary on our society that only repugnant dysfunction sells books. I agree with an earlier reviewer who brought forth the notion that this ""memoir"" eerily paralleled ""A Million Little Pieces"" in its phantasmagorical tenor. Were it not for the fact I was unfortunate enough to be obligated to read this ""literary"" monstrosity, I would never have voluntarily done so. Fortunately, I can derive my own conclusions as to the veracity of this oeuvre instead of weepingly sympathizing with the ""horror"" the author purports to have experienced during her incommodious childhood. Bear in mind that the author is a gossip columnist, a profession unknown for its veridicality and comity.This is a vile 'chic lit' whose non-existent qualities I refuse to extol as I am not a pusillanimous poltroon which many reviewers seem to be given the rave accolades."
4,"""Everyone who is interesting has a past""","Although I shuddered at the neglect and selfishness of Jeannette Walls' parents who created unbelieveable challenges for their children, I grew to understand them, respect them, and admire the strength their children gained from them. Jeannette Walls does an excellent job of making the reader understand the complexities of her parents so that a fair portrayal of them surpasses the reader's ability to pass quick judgement. The reader concludes the memoir understanding how Jeannette can love her parents and respect them despite the living hell they put her through. Very pleasant style of writing. Simple yet profound. So meaningful because it is a true story of success that beats incredible odds."
2,Not Up To The Hype,"The title, the reviews, and the blurb on the back made me believe that I would love this book. However, I did not. The writing was decent, but did not involve me emotionally. The story was boring and unbelievable at times (even though this is a work of non-fiction). Save your money and reread a classic."
5,Great non-fiction for Fiction lovers.,I read this book for a book club and LOVED it. I usually read historical fiction and was not very enthused about reading non-fiction. But this book read like an account of a fictional family. Simply fascinating! I had to keep reminding myself this book was really true. GREAT reading.
5,Glass Castle,"Wonderful story, and because it is true makes it a page turner.Hard to believe kids could live through all they did."
2,Good Stories but Terrible Writing,"I was really disappointed with this book. Walls' stories certainly have enough shock value to sustain the reader's interest, but the writing itself is very bland and far from moving. If you're looking for powerful language or elegance of style, look elsewhere."
5,America needs our help,"Although as the book starts out, it would be hard to believe that a 3 year old could remember life at that time with such detail. I appreciate the author sharing her story, and would it not be for the fact that in this day and age, families still live like this, it might have been a one of kind. Makes one wonder about the fact that ""America - home of the free"" we have people living the lives described in this book but yet we continue to send money to other countries. As the book points out - once and only once did a social worker check on these children. What does that tell us as a society - that people choose to ignore the way children lived then, and sadly live today?I agree this is an excellent book...and Walls has a fantastic storytelling knack - she tells a story that needs to be listened to."
2,was suggested by a friend but ?,It was suggested by a friend but have read much better books of poverty survival. Not in the catagory of good reading I think
3,Most forgiving daughter ever,"This was a bookclub pick. Her story is grim and exhausting, and yet her attitude seems to be perky and cheerful throughout. I found myself thinking that she has mastered the art of denial.Walls was surrounded (I can't say raised) by severely dysfunctional people who had the intelligence, but not the ability to participate and contribute to society. Their prideful choices to break social covenants, neglect basic child welfare, and manipulate their children to ensure their personal addictions were fed should have destroyed their family. Some may say that she has simply found a way to forgive and move on, but forgiveness does nothing to prevent this kind of abuse.Jeannette Wells is a highly unusual survivor. Her story needs to be told - for there are thousands of children who exist in these kinds of conditions - but there is no redemption here for the vast majority."
5,Wow! Amazing! What a book!,"I loved every page, every sentence, every word. I wish it could have gone on and on and never ended. I will never forget this book. It was one of the best vacations I've ever had. What more can I say? I feel any attempt to describe the contents would do it a disservice, so I'll omit that. After reading the first few pages, I was hooked and carried along until the end. I'm generally not one for memoirs, because I usually find myself hesitating at spots which strike me as not true to life. I felt no such hiccups when reading this one. I've been telling everyone they'd really enjoy this book. I rank this one up there with German Boy and Dale Carnegie's Lincoln."
4,Disturbing and wonderful!,Jeannette Walls does a fantastic job weaving us through the chaos of her youth. Details may disturb some readers but Ms. Walls tells her graphic story with humor and compassion. Helpful for those of us who think that our upbringing was less-than-perfect. Thoroughly enjoying for those trying to make sense of family disappointments and dysfunction.
5,Spirited and courageous,"Jeanette was spirited and feisty. In spite of the deplorable living circumstances this person was able to persevere and find adventure along with the courage and determination to move beyond. I laughed out loud and felt deep sadness for her and her siblings. Jeanette's writing was so descriptive I felt I could visualize the places they lived and the children she played and fought with. This truly is a life of courage, acceptance, tolerance, hope and love."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this book,This is the heart wrenching but so fascinating story of Jeannette Wall's childhood - it just reads so nice I was sad when I was done - i could just read on and on about her and her parents living such unimaginable lives while still beeing passionate and never giving up! highly recommended - I would give it 10 stars if I could
5,Simply Wonderful,"I loved this book. It is well written, heartfelt, touching - just great. I couldn't put it down. I read a lot of books and I put this in my top 5 ever. I went out and bought copies for several friends after I read it."
5,Raw and Real,"This book was one of those stories that's like a train wreck. You don't want to keep reading, but you can't stop. It's sad, but it's also a story of perserverence and overcoming the odds. I really enjoyed it."
5,One in a million!,"This book is my favorite book by far. I was able to relate to Jeannette's story countless times and the emotion it drew out of me was immeasurable. There were a few sentences about her father near the end that gripped me and had me literally bawling (which doesn't normally happen to me). This is the story of a family's undying love for each other, despite all their struggles and ""different"" way of life. No matter how awful things were or how awful they may have been to each other, they were still a family and had hopes for better things. Harsh reality is put in your face constantly throughout this book, so if you can't handle that, don't read it! I just finished Half Broke Horses, Jeannette's second book, and I have no choice but to reread The Glass Castle now to watch this beautiful story unfold once again."
1,Happy for all those who loved this book.,"I was stunned to see all the 5 star reviews for this book. I don't want to rain on the parade of all those who rave and swoon for Walls' memoir, but I couldn't resist the impulse to add my own two cents worth, just to provide a little balance. Quite simply, after reading the opening, I was astonished at the simplistic approach of the author. I skipped ahead, read a little, skipped ahead again, etc., etc. It didn't get better. There's something terribly wrong with most of the people in the book, but it goes almost unacknowledged and never explained. The writing certainly doesn't salvage the experience. I don't remember who recommended it to me, and it's just as well, because I consider it to be at best a waste of time."
1,Like a personal journal that gets you on Jerry Springer,"I was recommended this book by someone on a plane - saying it was very funny.Maybe - in the German version she was reading. But the original English version was SAD, verging on depressing and not at all funny.Then, I started questioning how much of the memoir is true. Even if the story is told from a adult recollection of her crazy childhood, it is barely plausible. I read the whole thing, just to see how it ended. That her life changed for the better is not really explored. The story just seemed to wane - like the author was just too spent to provide insight or inspiration.I was hoping for redemption, or hope - like in the book ""Come Back to Me"". Unfortunately, I never found it in ""The Glass Castle"".If this story is entirely true, then I applaud the author's success in rising above her unfortunate circumstances. But I never understood what lessons she learned that deserve to be shared with a wider audience. So I cannot recommend this book."
3,"No ""Angela's Ashes""","This book was a real page-turner, and I enjoyed the author's straightforward, journalistic style, but it was no ""Angela's Ashes."" At one point the author likens herself to the protagonist of ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"" another vastly superior book. I would recommend those two books before this one, but I did read it in two days and the story really pulled me in. Overall, though, the book was just average. Good for summer reading, but no classic or anything."
5,Great read!,"I loved this book. I was in a Borders while on vacation and another customer told me to get this book. I usually don't get books that complete strangers tell me, but I'm sure glad I did. I could've finished it in a few hours but I made it last me a few days to savor it. Now I've got my mom reading it. I just loved the author and the way she described her experences when she was young. I highly recommend this book to anyone."
5,YES! This is a memoir!,While reading this book I had to remind myself several times that this really is a true story! You would not believe the hardships these poor children went through. On almost every page I was reading I had my jaw dropped in disbelief. READ THIS BOOK!
4,glass castle review,"Glass Castle is an intriguing book. You will see poverty in a different light. I didnt have a lot of the things i wanted growing up, but, I had the basics. I'm proud of Jeannette Wallls for overcoming her upbringing"
5,one of the best books i have ready recently...,An amazing story with almost poetic writing. I couldn't put it down. I look forward to anything else Ms. Walls writes. Truly inspiring.
3,sad story with a great voice,"I read this book very quickly. I tought Jeannette was very courageous to write such a memoir and a very very strong woman. As i plunged into the book I was semi waiting for something big to happen. Halfways through I began to get dissapointed and saw that there would be no huge event that just their life WAS a series of such things. As I rounded through toward the end I began to feel the characters and hope for the kids to get out and the mom to save herself just as Jeannette wished.This book was a great account, I especially felt sad for Maureen and wanted to know more if she found her happiness out west and confronted her mental illness.Great Story!"
4,Sad but inspiring,Sad but inspiring to see how the children of parents who chose to be homeless and take their children on this journey found their way out of this life style.
5,I remember the story a year later....,"One of the criteria I use to determine a 5 star book is whether I remember the book a week, a month, a year later. It has been at least a year, and I still remember and appreciate this book. It reads as easily as fiction, but is amazing in that this is a true story. I've read and enjoyed both J. Walls' books, but this is the better one."
5,great!!!,This is one of the best books I have ever read. I recomend to everyone to read. The author tells her chilhood story through the mind of a child. It makes you realize you don't have to be wealthy to be rich. I loved this book.
5,Unforgettable,The story is just that unforgettable. It is a story that is told in the first person. The narrator is describing her life with her family. The struggles of having an alcoholic father and a weak mother. Along with her siblings she is taken on an adventure that lasts her whole life because of the ties with her family. The ties that are the strongest make the deepest impressions on her life.
5,True story's are always the best.,"I also read her second book "" Half Broke Horses"" Another great read. I couldn't see the connection till nearly the end of the second book and wa la , it all fell together. Those who think they had it tough as a kid, need only to read both books to realize how tough it can be. Rise aove it and succeed."
5,loved it,"This is amazing. It is well written, and as you turn each page, you cannot imagine it could get any worse. The most remarkable part is that it was truly a life lived. I wish I could've scooped those kids up and made their lives right. How did they slip through the cracks?"
5,eye opener,Very well written story of one families experience of poverty; all the more surprising that the parents were well educated and thought education [though not necessarily school] was important.
5,The Other Side of the Loooking Glass,"I rate this right up there with Frank McCord's Angela's Ashes, Miss Walls is just a very gifted writer who has lived two very different lifestyles, and comes out on top for her gutsy of memoir of her hellish childhood. I said hellish, but rethinking that, she was able to overcome and still love her crazy mixed up family. I share your story! somehow I too, stumbled thru!"
5,Excellent,A must read! Such a great book. Makes my crazy family seem so ... Normal? I couldn't put it down because I was so absorbed into Jeanette's life!
4,Truth is stranger than fiction!,"It took me a while to realise that this could be a true story and indeed it is! It's heart-rending but so cleverly told that it is often amusing and amazing. Well done, Jeannette has struck the right note, I often think about the events in this book and the author's 'adventure-filled' childhood.This book should appeal to anyone who has ever wondered about their children's upbringing, anyone who has had a tumultuous childhood is sure to enjoy it too, it's for parents and grown-up children alike or anyone who is curious to find out how resilient children are and how self-deceptive grown-ups can be."
5,echoes from my youth,The Glass Castle captivated me from the moment I started reading it. I found solice in reading about someone else's life that resembled some of my childhood memories. Thank you. Mary
3,"Good Story, but too depressing for me","I enjoyed the story, and the characters were well rounded. The story was very honest and real with how some children are raised, and I guess that's why it was so depressing. I wish it had gone into depth more about the lives of the children and mother after the father's death, as well as the story of the parents before their marriage. I think knowing those things would have explained a lot of why the parents were the way they were, and it would let me know what kind of effect it had, if any, on the children as adults.All in all, it was worth the read, but I don't like to read stories like this too often. It makes my next read very light."
5,Glass Castle,"I read Half Broke Horses prior to buying this book because I liked it some much, I was not disappointed with Glass Castle!"
4,Wow!,"This story made me cry laugh and cry some more. While I am so sad for everything this family has had to go through I am so happy they have made the very best of it. I really felt for the father in this story the most. He had such potential for being a wonderful parent, but alcoholism got in his way. I felt so sad that he was never ever able to reach his dreams. I'm so glad that Jannette and her siblings were able to live theirs. What a brave woman she is. I would recommend reading this book. But be aware there is lots of foul language."
5,Food for Thought,I definitely thought this was a great read. It provided a lot of food for thought and it gave myself and my friends a lot to discuss.It is hard to believe that people can inflict such a terrible upbringing on their children.I am dedicated to increasing awareness about child abuse.Please visit my website:[..]
1,Too much discrepancy.,"Read this book with a big grain of salt. I can't believe how many people were sucked in by this contrived story. No spoilers here, but read carefully and you can see how some of this, if not most couldn't be accurate."
1,one of the worst books i have ever read,"i read this on the glowing recommendation of a friend. i can't find words enough to describe how awful, terrible this book is. don't waste your time. i didn't want to give it one star, but it seems you have to rate it at least with one."
1,terrible read,"I was very disappointed by this book after all of the wonderful reviews. Although the author develops the characters very well, the prose was lacking. She spent alot of time building to the finale but then wrapped her whole story up very quickly. So tired of all of these sad sad books and stories"
1,Depressing,"This book upset me so much, how could this be a memoir? Just too awful for words. We worked so hard to give our kids the best we could, protected them, cared for them yet we lost a son to illness, not from lack of trying. These kids seem to flourish through horrible circumstances. I was very depressed with this one. And I have to discuss it for book club. What a waste of money!"
3,Hard to put down,"This book was kind of weird. I mean it really captivated you, at the same time was disturbing. Being the long time girlfriend of an Alcoholic, anyone interested in reading about how alcoholism affects children in a family should really take a look at this book."
1,Couldn't Stomach Another Page,This book is incredibly boring. It's basically the same experience written over and over again. I picked it up again and again hoping it would get better. It never did. Waste of money. Can I get a refund?
5,one of my best,This is one of the best books I've ever read so far. I am sorry for reading it this late and and fall behind the discussions. I'm not a native English reader but I felt as if I'm reading it in my own language. I guess that is the thing that makes a writer phenomenal. I very much appreciate her sincerity and courage in this book.
5,Why Some People Should NEVER Have Children,"Its a miracle the children survived. I went through so many emotions with this book; mostly furious anger at the father and deep frustrations with the mother. These children are made of better stuff than I am because, if this had happened to me, there is no way I could have ever kindly acknowledged these two people after escaping from the hovel they called home.Its a good read that I finished in two days. How this family managed to slip through the cracks and escape the scrutiny of child protective agencies is truly amazing.All I can say is God Bless the Wall children; they sure did have guardian angels watching over them in all those years of suffering. Not once did I sense any anger or hatred coming from the author toward her parents in this book and as far as I'm concerned, no one would blame her if she had."
4,glass castle,You can't put it down. Never a dull moment and all of it is true. Everyone in our community is reading it.
4,Great Book,This book was recommended by several people so I read it and it was absolutely nothing like I expected. What an amazing story and what an amazing family! It's almost like you feel you're there with the characters and feel Jeannette's pain and pride. This is a must read.
3,Disturbing Dysfunction,"A friend referred this book as a 'must read' but now I wonder why I bothered? Jeannette writes with simplicity and narrates well however, the chilling details of her life mucked with such dysfunction and neglect are unsettling. I suppose it's a must read for Creative Writing 101 pupils. Personally, it left a burdensome aftertaste, one I'd like to forget."
5,Glass Castle Review,"I could not put this book down. This is not only a well-written autobiography but it also gives a picture of the United States from a very unique perspective. Ms. Walls should be congratulated for her accomplishment in writing this book, a task that was apparently beautiful and painful. I was hooked on page one."
4,"Heart-wrenching, but poignant","Wow, this is an amazing story about a family who tries to hold it all together despite some very serious dysfunction. I found myself alternately in disbelief, awe, and sadness for the trials that this family, especially the children, went through. At times, it was hard to put down. Overall, it sure made my sometimes ho-hum life look like a fairy tale!Ho-hum may not be so bad after all! :)"
5,great,"I have been a fan of Jeannette for years. I try to read her column at MSNBC....But I was not prepared for what a great read The Glass Castle was. It was such a page turner, I had trouble putting it down..."
4,A Story That Touches the Heart,"I could hardly put it down. The Glass Castle is masterfully written. The Author Jeannette Wall is a gifted writer who knows how to give her characters heart and flesh. I could see, hear and feel her pain and pride in the midst of a dysfunctional but fascinating family. I loved watching as she emerged into an intelligent and motivated young woman. I loved seeing her begin the personal healing process of accepting the things she could not change and the courage to change the things she could. This is a story that can give hope to many in similar circumstances. One caution is worth noting. Because the language in this book is raw and in-your-face, it may be too graphic for some readers. I feel that it would have been an excellent book without it; however, some could argue that at least one of the characters could not have been accurately portrayed any other way. Reluctantly, due to the language, I've given this book a four-star rather than a five-star rating."
4,Unique story really brings you into the family.,"This memoir begins when the author is young child and follows her through to adulthood. What I found the most interesting was how much the author still accepted and loved her parents - esp her father despite their numerous failings -and how by the end of the book I found myself caring for her family as well. She really paints a great pict of why she loved and stood by her parents and how hard it was to just 'accept' them the way they were. I loved how much she loved her dad and how much she wanted to believe in him. I could see his inventive, explorer side as well as the alcoholic, irresponsible side."
3,Curious,"I am curious as to how memoir writers remember dialog so vividly from age three. After the James Frey debacle (I had read Frey's memoir and hated it), memoir writers will be duly suspect by readers. There is a lot of vivid detail that I wonder how the author remembers it all.The Glass Castle is an easy read...choppy at times...but easy. We as readers hope things will get better for the author's family but things don't. I heard Sherman Alexie say that he will consider himself a success as a parent if his kids DON'T write a memoirs. I have friends who read exclusively in this genre but I have a hard time with it and it is a long time between memoirs for me. If my book club hadn't selected it, I would never have picked it up."
2,A little dry for me,"In a nutshell, the author reflects on her childhood, growing up with an alcoholic father and a mother who suffers from mental disorders.In general, this is not a bad book. Personally, I didn't find her childhood to be that disturbing, at least not compared to someone like my mother whose childhood was rather grim.What I didn't like about the book was the dry narrative. ""First, we moved here and this happened and then we moved there and that happened and then we did this and then we did that, and then, and then...""I found myself skipping through a lot of this."
4,Beautifully tragic,"I will start by saying that memoirs are not my thing. Having said that this was one of the most moving, intense, powerful, emotional and beautiful books I have ever read. I could not put the book down, I needed to know that this little girl and her siblings were going to be ok. I'm amazed by the courage and strength it must have taken to write her history and share her story. I highly recommend this book- I cried, I laughed, I got mad and most of all I really enjoyed this read!"
3,Depressing,"After 100 pages you will know if you like or fear this blunt and scarry ( I'm told biography). It teaches nothing except surival and, perhaps the evils of addiction. Truely wish I hadn't read it! It was my book club book. ( what can I say?) Isn't the everyday world crazy enough, do you need to be drawn into a truly messed up world in book form, when its all around us????"
3,"Well written and realistic, but...","Ms. Walls writes a matter-of-fact memoir of a childhood that proves the maxim that truth truly is stranger than fiction. However, even though the writing was clear and lucid, I could hardly get through this book. It is beyond me how two such selfish, narcissistic losers (her parents) raised kids who turned out as well as they did. I have dealt with alcoholism before, and Rex Walls was a textbook alcoholic with a Jekyll & Hyde personality. Rose Mary was no better; she was just the enabler, & certainly had mental and/or emotional problems of her own. All credit to the Walls kids for surviving in the shadow of two of the most self-absorbed people I have ever read about."
2,not my thing,"An interesting story.Her family's adventures aren't the kind I enjoy -- I kept expecting the inevitable Something Awful to happen, because the parents were clearly on a path to destruction. There's never really any such blowup, though; life just keeps going (albeit going way way downhill) and there's a certain detachment (even though the author certainly narrates lots of feelings about various events).Near the end, there's a nod toward how her parents inform her understanding of homelessness/the homeless, but it's not really delved into -- which is understandable, since it's not the point of the memoir.It's an interesting look at people who approach the world v. v. differently than I do (the narrator's parents) and people who grew up with v. v. different experiences than I did (the narrator and her siblings), but I'm not really compelled to recommend it to anyone (nor do I disagree with my initial sense, having read the bookjacket blurb, that I had no interest in reading this book)."
5,I'm speechless,"I just finished reading this book. All I could keep thinking is that this should be required reading for every middle school kid in America, especially those who feel deprived because they don't have the latest IPod, or they don't have anything to do after school every day. Superb writing. Amazing the way Ms Walls is not bitter about her past or angry with her parents."
2,Verification?,"I agree with many, a memory going back to three years old is almost absurd. Also, has anyone bothered to verify her story? People have spent many hours on A Million Little Pieces and found many facts in his story false, but what about hers? Has anyone checked hospital records, birth records and asking questions? I think too many people focused on Frey's book and not hers, which maybe worth verifying before taken as true."
5,Riveting...,"I couldn't stop reading this book knowing that every word was true and yet so unbelievable. It demonstrates how truly resourceful and resilient kids can be when they need to. It's a must-read for anyone working in child welfare but a fascinating book for anyone else, too."
2,Depressing,"I think this is a very good book, but I couldn't continue past about page 150. The story of this little girl is so depressing. I think it is a true story and I can't imagine having to grow up like this. I guess I am depressed by reality."
5,Great Reading,"This book is great, it ranks up there with "" Change Me into Zeus's Daughter "" by Barbara Moss Robinette. I am a child of a women who should never have had children she was an alcoholic and my father drank to much and seemed to be detached from her doings, I guess it was a way for him to survive and stay married. I have watched them make each other miserable for almost 60 years. Reading these to books helped me to be able to laugh at some things that I couldn't see the humor in before."
2,terrible!!,what a letdown!! drama queen telling the drawn out story of her neglected childhood. i dont believe anything she wrote. dont waste your time!
3,THE GLASS CASTLE,To me this book was distrubing and enlightening. The parents were some of the worst abusers I've ever read about. Not sexual but neglectful and uncaring.
5,"Easy Read, Inspiring Story :)","This was a very enjoyable book to read before bed each night :) A very inspiring story of a girl who was raised in a very poor family, in horrible conditions... and managed to pull strength out of her struggles, see the positive, and forge ahead. A great book to help put your own life into perspective!"
3,Did they ever get the money?,"I read most of the reviews, some people believe it some don't. I read this book and made me think about how little children need to grow up. One of the mysteries that still remain for me about this book are...did they ever get the money from her mom? What happened with the house in Phoenix? and the land in Texas or the jewelry that Grandma left to her mother. Did they ever enjoy any of these? I hope so. I agree with everybody, you cannot stop reading this book until you are done with it but you have to endure the suffering of children and the abuse of their parents."
2,Such a Shallow Accounting of a Potentially Deep Story,"I read this book per the recommendation of the friend and the reviews were very good. I just finished and I am very disappointed. The author simply wrote a blow-by-blow of the hardships of herself and her family without ever getting beneath the surface to provide how these experiences affected even herself. Each chapter was more ""we did this and then we did this"" simply telling a story that had so much potential to be more. The book ended abruptly and I didn't feel any connection to the author or her family. At a minimum, I expected the author to give us more of a look beneath the surface for how her experiences shaped who she is today. Until this book becomes Free on Kindle, I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Why the enthusiasm?,"This is one heck of a monotonous, tedious book. Every chapter details another instance of how the author's alcoholic father and enabling, mentally absent mother neglected/abused/failed their kids, and paints the behavior as kooky and endearing. The book lacks both immediacy in the telling *and* the clarity of hindsight and evolution of critical thought that makes for a satisfying memoir. It's simply a laundry list of bad parenting, told through rose-colored glasses via clunky prose.I wish reviewers would have the chutzpah to be less than blindly effusive in their praise just because the subject matter is <gasp> sensitive."
4,Inspired,"I put together my summer reading collection a few weeks ago, and after I read such good reviews about this book in particular, I coulnd't wait to read it, and it was worth everything it was hyped up to be!Jeannette takes the hard life that she lived and turns it into a beautiful story, told with out even a hint of self-pity. To think of what she and her siblings survived makes you wonder if you would have been able to cope the way these children did.I would strongly suggest this Memoir be a part of everyone's collection."
2,If you've been given nothing-- its hard to give back,"This book feeds pain bodies. The author gave me nothing but a string of negative incidents where her parents were neglectful and or feeding their addictions and being quirky and or mentally ill. It was boring. There is so much more to this story but Walls' holds back, most likely because it will be in another edition which her happy readers will buy into, and once again you will get only half a story. In my humble opinion it is half a book, and appeals to the voyeurs in us. If you are feeling sad in any way dont read this book."
3,"Catharsis, period...","This is an incredible story...and I mean incredible. It is almost impossible to believe that these three children (I'm not too sure about Maureen)survived such a childhood. That both parents were mentally ill goes without saying, and it actually does go without saying. At the end of the book, the mother is still living rough and being portrayed as some sort of Apple Annie.As for the writing, it wasn't particularly good--certainly nothing like Angela's Ashes or The Liars' Club. It was like a recording of events; not too much emotional depth in what she had to say. The subject matter was what kept me reading. As the kids got older, things skipped a bit...I'm still a bit fuzzy as to how this tall, skinny, ugly kid with buckteeth was able to attend an Ivy League university, marry a millionaire and become the knock out on the back cover. Did I miss the ""makeover""? I just don't believe her homemade braces actually worked."
5,Fabulous,"I could not put this book down. When forced to put the book down I had to resist frequent urges to return to reading. Now I have finished the book and I'm wondering how I will fill this empty void in my life. An amazing true story that provides great insight about poverty, homelessness, and life choices."
5,Fabulous,"This book was the most entertaining thing I've read in the last year - and I read a lot of books. I checked it out of the library, but I'm going to buy a copy because I know that if I'll be reading it again in the future. A keeper!"
5,She Owns Venus,"This is a ""can't put down"" memoir along the lines of ""Angela's Ashes"" and ""The Liar's Club"". Jeannette Walls takes us to places that most of us have never been, and yet, some aspects of her childhood will be familiar to all of us 40-somethings (e.g., POW bracelets and staying out until the streetlights come on). This was a brave memoir to write when you consider that Ms. Walls is now a highly successful ""personality"" in the world of celebrity. And who's to judge; isn't there at least a little dysfunction in all of us?"
2,Not Much,"Every year prooduces a breakout memoir -- this year it's ""The Glass Castle."" Intriged by all the much hyped press about the book, I bought a used copy here on Amazon. I imagine the reason this book has gained so much attention is the author's ties to the press which has given her access to instant promotion. The book itself is written in a straight forward narrative style that comes off as a long magazine article. Little to no insight or reflection into the chaos and dysfunction of her family life is made by Walls nor does she ever explain how it exactly impacted her forming consciousness. ""Mama is manic, Daddy is drunk and we are moving again"" seems to be the repetitive theme. The stories of her childhood events lack drama, tension and humor. Where any childs loss of innocence at the hands of CRAZY adults is humanities greatest shame, this book comes up way short in providing the reader with any constructive insight."
5,Book you'll read over and over again,This is an amazing true story and just is so compelling. I read it in about 2 days and just really enjoyed it. I plan on reading it again.
3,Compelling,"I read this book very quickly. The writing is very simple, and the story is compelling. I didn't question the authenticity, it all seemed plausible once she set the context of her VERY bohemian family. Yes, it was abusive, but it seems that Jeannette didn't see it that way and/or has gotten over it.It reminded me of the book ""Running with Scissors"", although not as funny.I found that some of the stories went no where or had no point. But, it's a memoir, and the author is alowed to wander and tell the story as she remembers it."
5,Great true story,"I've always loved fiction, but in recent years have found most novels to be predictable. So, I started reading memoirs and this one was not disappointing. If you like stories about people overcoming incredible odds, you'll love this book. With a straightforward narrative, the author states the challenging conditions of poverty and homelessness, among others, while showing readers the gifts those challenges nurtured. I couldn't put it down."
5,I'm...bewildered.,"Jeannette shows so much resilience that it almost carries through. As the reader, I felt empowered in ways I never expected to be, whether it was the recognition of my past or the beginning of accepting my family for who they are. Jeannette teaches and will teach you things about yourself you never realized you could learn from a book. She's inspiring and captivating her life is one worth hearing."
5,Spellbinding Story,"My daughter (40 yr old) first read this book and strongly encouraged me to read it. I downloaded it to my Kindle and absolutely was drawn in by the tragic, sometimes funny story of a struggling family. This story truely speaks to the power of overcoming your childhood! The Glass Castle was enthralling and I couldn't stop reading. Absolutely loved it."
4,Raising kids in poverty,A real human struggle to overcome poverty and bad parents. Tough times sometimes lead to survivors who accomplish better lives. Bigcelt
5,Excellent book,I couldn't put this book down. It is so sad to see someone that is obviously mentally I'll try to raise children the way the mother did. It's amazing that the children were able to overcome their upbringing and go on to be successful.
5,Utterly Facinating!,I could not put this book down. I had to continually remind myself that this was a non-fiction book and that a family acutally lived the life and adventure discribed in this tale. This was a wonderful read and I applaud Jeanette Walls for telling her story.
4,Great first person story,"I have always loved those stories where the lead character is the Author. I have always felt that each of us in our own way has a story tell, no matter who we may be. We can all write about our childhood and the ups and downs of growing up that most readers can relate too. This is great. Highly Recommended."
4,brilliant,"Not only is Jeannette an extremely good writer, but I also found the content both moving and convicting.Her story made me realise afresh that you can never understand what a person has been through, 'til you read their full life history. The narrative about her early childhood was riveting and despite the odds stacked against her, she's pulled through to a successful adult life.Her willingness to work hard and fight has made her stronger - a great example of our human resilience which she portrays very well."
4,This book is great,I enjoyed it even though I thought I wouldn't. I read it along with my son for his high school english class and it became a source of conversation for us.
5,Fascinating Memoir,I bought this book once before and purchased this copy for a friend. It is an amazing account.
5,Excellent book,I recently read this book for my book club and absolutely loved it. The author writes with such an honest voice and tells amazing stories.
3,"Sick, horrible childish parents, painful to read","This supposed memoir should be classified as a child's biography of abuse and neglect. It is painful to read and I was shocked by how disconnected the author is from what happens to her and how it feels. Of course as a child she obviously felt like she had no choice but later on she seems to have done absolutely no work on herself, trying to heal such an awful childhood and come to terms with the fact that she had horrible and childish parents who really shouldn't have had any children. Why does she look up to them? The world would be so much healthier if people had to have psychological screenings in order to have children. It is a well written, tell it like it is story. Her emotionless stories of dismally awful situations made me shudder in horror and wonder at just how much she has really dealt with her tragic childhood."
4,fascinating!,"This unflinching look at love and pain while growing up with increasingly dysfunctional parents is captivating. I appreciated the honest, non-judgemental and unsentimental account that leaves readers to draw their own conclusions. This easily could have been a ""poor me"" book but is as far from that as her own Park Ave. lifestyle is from her parents' dumpster diving."
4,Not Norman Rockwell!,"Somewhat my childrens story, although I didn't view it as an adventure, It was called having a ""dead-beat-dad"" who gave the family nothing but a bad time and a mother who was uneducated, worked for minimum wage and raised a family the best she knew how.But in this case the parents were very intelligent and why they chose a life of poverty is a mystery to me, although alcoholism may have something to do with it, ya think?"
5,Excellent book,My sister recommended this book and I am so glad she did. It was a wonderful story. I have since shared the story with several others who have all had rave reviews of the book as well. Unfortunately I was looking for a book to take me through at least a week and this story was read in two days.
2,Where is the author?,"After a few chapters of this story of a frightful set of parents, alcoholic and narcissistic, I skipped to the end to learn little to nothing about the effects on the three children. The author seemed bemused still by her own survival and that of her sister and brother. So what was the point.I also began to doubt the author's honesty, not from the story line which absolutely no one could have made up, but by the details of her memories from so young an age.Someone helped her write this but that someone is not mentioned.Shocking but annoying.Don't bother."
2,A harsh judgement perhaps.,"The story starts out as a compelling peek at a dysfunctional family. It soon degenerates into a narrative of poor decisions, repetitive mistakes, and cycles of poverty. This would be interesting if some of the characters actually grew. But no - the adult children in the tale actually aid and abet their parents' unhealthy and criminal behavior (with the possible exception of the son, Brian.) Despite Ms. Wall's (and siblings') prosperity and rise out of destitution, they continue to enable bad behavior in their parents, all under the guise of love.This was a confusing and preposterous saga of family life run amok. Ms. Walls did not have the good sense to feel embarrassed by her complicity in her parents' downfall."
5,Why do I read the 1 star reviews?,"I need to stop punishing myself by reading the 1 star reviews. But just as this book was like a car accident that you don't want to look at but can't get enough of, so are those 1 star reviews.I probably would never have read this book had it not been for the many word of mouth reviews I received.All I can say is that the people I know who read this book are all very intelligent, educated, creative, and happy, people. They are not highly privileged people. Just hard-working people who are passionate about life. They all raved about this book and highly recommended it.I read the book in 2 days. I was riveted. It made me think. It made me angry. It made me grateful. It made me laugh and cry.Enough said."
3,good read,"this book is a good read, and it goes by quickly, moving story, love it!!Cant wait to read the 2nd book"
3,MESMERIZING STORY.,"Could not put this book down once I started it. The wedding picture of the parents show a very handsome couple starting out life together. How they could have lived the way they did with their children (in complete squallor) is beyond my imagination.} They were not penniless as we learn later in the story. The mother owned very valuable property. The children were always dirty and hungery.The characters in this memoire are not very likable. I wonder how much of the details are really true. A child of three years old and a little older cannot remember such detail as Jeannette wrote.I found this book a very interesting read, but not quite credible.Worth reading, however."
5,Excellent,"Truly one of the most remarkable memoirs you will ever read. Jeannette Walls is an extraordinary storyteller and her childhood recollections are so spellbinding that you won't be able to put this book down. The author, her sisters Lori and Maureen and her brother Brian were raised by parents who were dreamers. And of course, dreams do not pay the rent or feed the family. The children were often hungry (imagine eating Wonder bread and lard sandwiches), dirty, and dressed in hand-me-down clothes. Each child learned to cope in their own way with their extreme poverty, their father's alcoholism and extended absences, and their mother's moody and abstract sense of reality.This is NOT a mean or angry story, though. It is the author's loving tribute to her family who - despite it all - stuck together and survived crushing adversity. I adored this family. You will too. An unforgetable book."
5,It's the Jeannette I know,"I met Jeannette back when she first came to New York and I can attest that the book is a true account of what her life was like, at least to the degree I knew about it (obvoiusly many things were shielded from outside observers). So if there are any doubters, doubt no more.As to the book itself, I'm biased but I think she did a great job. There may be one weakness but that's also one of the book's strengths, and that is that Jeannette does not judge. Time and again I would read passages that frustrated me because they would contain descriptions of her parents' crazy behavior without judgement added. I wanted Jeannette to tear into them for their mistreatment of their kids, but she does so only intermittantly and never as much as I would like. Which, of course, leaves the reader free to draw their own judgements without being being told what to think. Although this is sometimes frustrating, in the end I think it makes for a stonger book."
3,"At times, a stretch of the imagination","The pure journalistic style of this book contrasts with its believability. For example, Walls says, ""By the time I was four, I was pretty good with Dad's pistol, a big, black six-shot revolver, and could hit five out of six beer bottles at thirty paces."" I can be forgiving and say that perhaps this is the nature of memories. I can say that, given the suffering she endured as a child, she has the right to artistic license. I can say the book was enjoyable reading, which it truly was. And I can also say that I was at the mercy of her vision and questioned whether other statements were, in fact, true."
5,Surviving adversity,"Jeannette Walls wrote a memoir which only proves the adage that ""truth is stranger than fiction"". It would be hard to think up such an amazing childhood and I'm still wondering if what Ms Walls went through wasn't made up. How did she survive and prosper with such adversity?I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants proof of the capablility of a human being to overcome and succeed despite all odds. A truly unforgettable book"
5,A must read,This book keeps your attention til the end! I've read this book twice and it never gets old. Buy it!
5,The Glass Castle,"This was the best book I have read this year. I would sugest reading or giving this book. It held your intrest until the end, and then I wished it would keep on. Hard to belive the girl who wrote it went through all this."
4,Great Book Club selection!,This book was an easy read...it reads like fiction...you will be cheering these kids on the whole way! It ignited fantastic discussions in our book club.
4,Courage and Honesty,"I loved the courage and honesty told in ""The Glass Castle"" and I'm impressed with Jeannette Walls' honesty. She shares with us her life with her parents that had it's up and downs. When she was younger she found joy doing things with her parents. As she got older and experienced life around other people she began to see how different her life was. She and her siblings each managed to cope with growing up in that environment in their own way. Some not as well as Jeannette. Jeannette proves to us that anything is possible."
5,Excellent!,"You won't be able to put this down. Some books take a few chapters for me to get interested enough to continue reading. Not this one. From page one I was hooked. Jeanette's life is shocking, hilarious, and sad...all at the same time. How she and her siblings turned out to be productive adults is amazing. I hope to read more from her in the future."
5,Wonderful book!,"I've read both of Jeannett's books ""The Glass Castle"" and ""Half Broke Horses"". Page turners! I would highly recommend these books!"
4,Riveting Read,"I read this because my sister had suggested it. When I finally decided I could not put it down , I also couldn't believe that a Mother could actually have children and subject them to a life like they had. It is like the Mom and Dad never grew up mentally? Please buy this one if you think you had a tough bringing up, you will never complain again after following this family.Pick a comfortable chair and a cup of tea, have a lap afghan because you will be settled in for awhile."
5,Inspirational and SUPERB!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - probably rank it as one of the BEST books I've read. It definitely raises the bar for books to follow. I liked the author's style of writing as it is filled with pride and not self-pity. Her optimisim, family loyality and indomitable spirit gave her memoir such energy, it was hard to put down. At times, I had to remind myself that this really happened to four children - more like angels! You question who are the parents and who the children are. Yet, the author doesn't make you hate her parents because you see in them a redeemable quality of ""togetherness"" and ""love"". A super book and a must read!"
3,The Glass Castle,"I'm 14 and was told to read this book by a friend of mine. So I did. I enjoyed it (and cringed a lot) but was not really amazed at it. Sure, she had a very bad childhood, and I applaud her for doing as well as she has. But there was no feeling in it. I could never tell exactly how she felt about her cat being thrown out a window, or finding a diamond ring. It just was. Which is fine, but because there was no point of view about it, it lacked the depth it could have had."
4,The Glass Castle - a reflection of a reality,"A powerfully, and beautifully, written memoir which describes what is, strives for what could be but does not get lost in the chasm between.It would be difficult to read this book and not to react to it strongly. A family which is, by most measures, dysfunctional: two chronological adults who need more parenting than their four biological offspring.But this is not told as the 'shock, horror' story of appalling upbringing. It combines hope and courage with the fear of the unknown. And, ultimately the acceptance of what is.'Just tell the truth' said Mom. 'That's simple enough.'Highly recommendedJennifer Cameron-Smith"
3,Not a bad read,"After all the hype that this book generated, I purchased the book full price, hard cover (very seldom do I do this) and I read it in a few days. No, it didn't change my life, but it was a good read overall. Whether or not the details of such memoir were fiction or facts, I guess I'll never know. I do find, however, as many of the readers did, very hard to believe that the author can describe with such accuracy events that happened when she was a 3-year-old girl. Nevertheless, I don't want to be cynical and give it the benefit of the doubt - perhaps brilliant, genius people can remember details better than the rest of us can, so I won't judge her credibility and instead I will commend her for the tone that she always used towards her parents - she wasn't bitter with her parents for the way she was raised; on the contrary, the love and admiration that she always devoted to her progenitors was very touching indeed."
5,I really enjoyed this book!,"I bought this book on a hunch and I am glad I did. Jeannette Walls relates her story with clarity and beauty. Although her childhood was fascinating and kept me interested through the entire book, what's truly astounding isn't so much that Jeannette and her family were poor, it's that she and her siblings overcame so many obstacles (really big obstacles that most of us don't even realize are still obstacles for people today) and learned-- by necessity-- to be so much more self-sufficient than many adults. It's really stunning that she and two of her siblings were able to persevere and make better lives for themselves considering how difficult they had it growing up.Walls' story is truly inspiring and motivating. It's also a perfect example of the American dream, right here, right now. Thoroughly recommended."
4,Like nothing I've ever read before,"This memoir was so harrowing; it was interesting, painful and intense to read. I would find myself absolutely sobbing, but could not put the book down. Jeannette Walls is a gifted writer who does not hold back. I highly recommend this book."
4,Interesting,"Interesting book. My son has to read this book before going back to school. I decided to read it as well. Some areas of the book are a little graphic, however, I understand that was how it happened. It seemed to end in an odd way."
5,Amazing True Story,I Love Love Love this book! Each page held me captive and I could hardly put it down. I recommend this book to all my friends looking for a fascinating story. A Must Read :D
5,COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN,Sometimes we who have our credit cards and nice houses and always food on the table forget that there is a whole other world out there that struggle for every crumb. I loved this book....I cried and laughed yet at the same time thanked God for my blessings.
4,makes me grateful for EVERYTHING,"didn't care to read this book....had insomnia and found it on my bookshelf....lent to me by someone, don't even remember who. FANTASTIC. It was so good my insomnia lasted another three nights while I finished it, but so worth the dark circles under my eyes"
5,Jeannette Walls is an amazing woman.,"I had the honor and privilege to hear Jeannette Walls speak tonight at Texas Tech University. She has had one interesting life and you can tell just by listening to her speak. She has an amazing stage presence and such a gift for story telling. She said tonight that she checks Amazon.com at least ""once or twice. a day."" Because of this, I have decided to post here! I just wanted to say what an amazing role model she is and how much I admire her! She said tonight that she was not looking for fame or a best selling book, she just hoped that she would change the way ""rich kids"" (which she described as people who's parents paid the bills) looked down on people like her. That takes an awesome person. I am truly inspired by her story and her life. As a broadcast journalism student at Texas Tech, it is great to be able to look up to someone in your field. I have found my role model and for that I am highly appreciative."
5,inspirational,What a fantastic book and so well written. An amazing true story of four children who were dealt an almost impossible hand in life but overcame the obstacles through determination and self reliance. I wish people who blame everyone else for their failures in life would read this book. This is one of the very best books that I have read in my sixty five years.
4,excellent story.........,"I love to read memoirs.. because they are based on truestories..so I read quite a few of them..this book wasgreat..and very well written..smooth read. There are alotof great memoirs out there..Memoirs of a Geisha was fabulous..The Bette Paige story was very good, although it was not amemoir..it was non fiction. Dance to Despair (Memoirs of anExotic Dancer) is a relatively new book that I highlyrecommend for those who want to read a story that theywill fascinate them."
1,Too much graffiti,"Was quite surprised that it came totally marked up by someone with some words even obscured in the copy. Delivery was fast but even though a second hand book, I've never gotten one through Amazon that looked so bad."
1,Not Impressed,"This book fell short of expectations in my eyes. I don't believe for one minute in the 20th century a family was allowed to live life in such squalor without any intervention. Either West Virginia is the most backwards place in this country or this story is a bit on the embellished side. The story would have been more believable had it taken place in the 1950's even the 60's but the late 70's, early-mid 80's, really?? I would never read another Jeanette Walls book."
1,great read,this book by far is the best book i have ever read. after i finished it i saw the author on oprah. she was remarkable and beautiful. i would recommend this book to everyone.
2,The title says it all,"Just the title "" The Glass Castle"" sounds simple and shallow. I tried to start reading this and I couldn't pass the first pages. That is usually what I do with books, see a few pages and read here and there and I know if I will be able to digest it. That is what I do if I want to buy one anyway. It has worked for me. What does that title mean? Why a castle to being with? I have realized that anybody can write (?) and publish a book in this country. About anything. This book is no exception.And look at her, please, not because appearances show it all but she was a writer for a gossiper column, she is the vivid example of the American drea. Blank, emotionless and shallow.No, thanks."
1,Embarrassing if True,"I read this book because I loved ""Angela's Ashes"". What I got was a story that suspended credulity and cause such a dislike of the author for capitalizing on such sordid memories (fantasies). To write about a father who was willing to offer his young daughter for his personal gain, the sexual abuse of one of the parents, and the willingness of a mother to bring up children while sitting on vast resources should be a source of embarrassment and have been kept ""in the family"". In fact, these episodes seemed to be made up to add a little spice to the boring narrative. There were no redeeming individuals in the book and no self-affirming experiences. The author should be ashamed of herself for capitalizing on the mental illness of her parents, if the story is true at all."
2,Blowhard Alert,"Overrated. For a woman who considers herself somewhat as a guardian of truth, I am very suspect of the ""truths"" she claims in her memoir. This may go over big with the midwestern housewife crowd, but I suspect anyone with a B.S. sensor will be rightfully skeptical."
1,Awful.,"Recollections of being a three year old? I do not think so. The author not only portrayed herself as a victim, but remains a victim. Through all of the disgusting, humiliating, neglectful things BOTH her parents put her through, she never said a word against them. Respect your mother and father.. PAH! Respect should be earned, and neither of them deserved one ounce of respect. You can buy a piano, but make your kids sleep on cardboard? You are able to, but will NOT work to look after your kids. The whole thing seemed to me to be just a story concocted for $$$, and has a vague connection to the actual events. When you know people who have genuinely experienced real hardship, it is hard to read the glorification of these despicable parents. I would not have finished the book, but it was chosen for a book club. I HATED every single page of it."
1,Not so much,"The author is incredibly talented and relates her traumatic experiences in a matter-of-fact manner that makes this book incredibly disturbing. In truth, I could not read more than the first three chapters or so because it was so painful to learn of her experiences. Perhaps I am simply to faint of heart, but wanted to submit this review in case there is someone out there who might have the same disposition."
4,"See a dysfunctional family function tthru this ""glass"" memoir.","People are spunky and inventive when they have to live by their wits.Parents who seem irresponsible actually bring up bright, cheerful,productive children. Well written --- a fun read."
4,Good easy read,This may not be the finest literature put to print but it makes for a fine good read. I think that most readers will be amazed that people were really bought up this way in America. All in all a good book.
5,Unbelievable,I find it so hard to believe people really live like this. Kudos to Jeannette and her siblings for overcoming the terrible lives that their parents raised them in. I found myself counting my blessings after reading this book. It is almost unbelievable! Our book club read this. It was enjoyed by all even though it saddened us.
5,Fortitude Defined,"I could not put this book down, it is amazingly well written, so descriptive one feels they are there. A story of a dysfunctional family that is probably more often true than any of us want to see or admit. For these children to survive and go as far as they have is incredible. Where they got their fortitude and perseverance deserves another book to explain to us just how this all can be. Someone had to influence them for good with all this bad happening at home. These parents were terrible, how could they possibly love these children. I don't see that part, I don't see love in these parents at all. Selfishness, yes."
4,"Great read...awesome details. Honestly, a page-turner","Definitely one of the best I've read in a while. I was impressed with the honesty about the living conditions and familial ups and downs. In some parts of the book, I was reminiscient of my life growing up in rural East Tennessee, but it was nowhere near as trying as this strong lady's upbringing. Thank you, Ms. Walls, for a glimpse into your life and a chance for the world to see the resourcefulness of people when necessary. I can't wait to read ""Half Broke Horses."""
5,Loved it....period...the end.,"I read this book in two days and was unhappy during the small amount of time that I needed to put it down. Jeanette Walls' account of her childhood is captivating, detailed and absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!!! I'm ready to start from page one all over again."
5,I Couldn't Put It Down!,This book was so touching on a few levels. Anyone who reads it will have a much clearer understanding of a much different world. Some who read it will be able to relate to her story. I read this book in two days because I could not put it down!
5,I will keep this book in my collection,This is by far one of the BEST books I have ever read. From the moment I picked this book up I felt like I was there going through these time with her. I wished the book would of never ended. I have passed this along to so many people and they have also raved about it.A must read.
5,You can't put it down...,"I don't know why this story is not a movie. It is an extraordinary tale--harrowing and funny. Poignant and sad, but all the while, riveting. I am not a fast reader and I couldn't put it down."
5,Compelling true story,"While I thought that the story was written a bit short of emotions, I found it justifiable since writing your own story is emotion-filled already. It was a very brave revelation for the author and the way she narrated her story has been compelling and, I believe, was honestly detailed. Her account of her childhood upbringing and traumas were apparently written in a manner that only one who have experienced it firsthand can do. All in all, it was a brave disclosure of a life which might be considered eccentric at obvious layers but definitely has a very substantial content to and is something great to reflect on."
5,"Thought provoking, won't be easily forgotten.","I highly recommend this book to anyone with alcoholism or mental illness in their family. The author's stories about her childhood are painful. Excruciating. But the real story is how she and her siblings learned to take care of themselves and each other. In The Glass Castle, the children of a dirt-poor alcoholic father and an enabling, neglectful mother develop incredible strength and work ethic. The book hints that letting kids fall down and scrape their knees and figure out how to solve their own problems might be kinder that coddling them and sheltering them from every possible inconvenience."
3,The glass is half full,"Walls' heartbreaking memoir of her dysfunctional childhood growing up with an alcoholic father and a mentally disturbed mother, who despite themselves, raise three successful children. Walls' lighthearted narrative counterbalanced the very dark and heavy subject matter and kept the story humming along on an even keel. I found myself laughing more than despairing, which I think is how Walls herself looks back on her life."
5,The Glass Castle,"This book is a must read, I couldn't put it down. What this person endured as a child is totally unbelievable, but true. It makes you realize that there are a lot of dysfunctional families all over the USA, this is how they were raised and some of them cannot get out or change the mould, but this woman did. I will recommend this book to everyone who loves to read.Also, God Bless all the Jeannette Walls in the world!"
3,The Glass Castle,"This book tells a very depressing story of a disfuctional family. The father is a drunk, and the mother is nuts. As a result, the children are neglected, go hungry, wear old torn clothes, and have to fend for themselves. The kids grow-up, but there are many problems along the way."
3,Pages #1-241 GREAT...then it got lazy.,"I enjoyed the read up until ""New York"" -From pages 1 to 241 I couldn't put the book down. Then it went downhill. For example, Eric. Throughout the first 241 pages Jeanette occasionally goes into detail about her thoughts, curiosity, and interactions with boys. Then all of sudden she's in New York & there is Eric and they marry. Where did he come from, how did you meet, ect. ect - And all of the years you spent with him were muted until you left him. ""A year after Dad Died, I left Eric."" The end. Where did all the detail go? All the situations and memories became so vague and uninteresting in the end of the book...After stringing us along & laying her childhood down before us readers, it's like she shut us out once she reached New York. It left me wanting more...Details, details, details! Ready for part two, I'd read it! :)"
3,Tough Read,"I found this book disturbing. While it was very well written, the content of the story and how these children were raised was just bizzarre."
4,Very good Service,I was very pleased with this book. It came in less than a week and the book was in very good shape.
5,booksbytucker,Unbelievable delivery time-Ordered August 28 Received by September 2-will use seller when available even if not the lowest price
2,Not believable,"It puzzles me why this book got wide praise. Very disappointing. It wasn't believeable that this was the memoir of a child, begining at the age of three. No one remembers that kind of detail from age three, or five, or even ten. Much of the story had to be fictionally created. I stumbled through about half the book and then skipped to the end to see what happened to the characters, not that I cared much. The parents were deplorable, not amusing or eccentric as the writer would have us believe. I gave up when the mother sluffed off Jeanette's report of the uncle who exposed himself to her and went back to her crossword puzzle."
5,"Beg, borrow or steal a copy","Gardening books are usually pretty utilitarian affairs, but this one is a pure literary delight.Loewer not only provides copious amounts of information, but he weaves an enchanting tale of the garden at night. As if that's not enough, he also provides intricate line drawings of many of the featured plants.This gem has a permanent place on my nightstand. I like to reread favorite evocative passages -- I can practially smell the jasmine and hear the delicate flutter of moth wings.I realize the book is out of print but if you have an interest in evening gardens (or just great writing) it's worth your while to hunt down a copy. You won't be disappointed."
3,Very fine book -,"This book has excellent information, it just didn't fit my needs. However, the information was excellent, and I am glad I purchased the book. It would have been nice to have color plates of the flowers, since the black and white line drawings were a little inadequate."
1,Defective CD,Disc 2 has noise that sounds like radio static between stations. A couple of other people I know on a music forum had the same problem. We all ordered it because it cost $2.89. I returned it.
2,bad quality manufacturing of the CD,"The manufacturing quality of this dual Cd is very bad- it is making noise like a static discharges.I got a second set as a replacement from Amazon, but it is with the same defect and I gave up.I tried CD on 3 Cd players, 3 computers- it did not worked.This is the first case in my life I see something like this."
1,Beware of a defective disc,"I gave this set only one star due to heavy static on disc two, not the performances themselves. As you may already know, other reviews here report this problem. I purchased this set hoping that my copy would be fine, but this was not to be. There is a single-disc DGG set that contains all of these performances except for the 27th, and no reviews of that set report sound problems.Disc one contains the performances of the 8th and 23rd. Let me comment on the 8th. I am no authority on Mozart's piano concertos, but I listen to them almost every day and happen to favor the early ones over the later. I have had two versions of the 8th -- by Ashkenazy and Perahia -- and the Kempff version has become my favorite. For all the lovers of Mozart, it is a shame that there are so few recordings of his piano concertos by this exquisite interpreter."

2,Poor VHS visual quality,"I tried watching this but the tape quality was dreadful! The picture quality is fuzzy. WWF No Mercy 2001 was a very good pay-per view event which was ruined by a bad and cheap VHS tape quality. It kinda reminds me of those old WWF Supertape VHS cassettes that I used to rent as a kid, only to be disappointed when I had to watch it on VHS and the picture quality was fuzzy. Pressing tracking didn't help matters as it is the fault of the manufacturer's for using cheap and poor quality tape material. I would recommend buying the DVD version of this event; it might cost you more but it is well worth it."
4,10th Time's The Charm,"LL Cool J shows that he has not left the rap game just yet. With his tenth album (appropriately named) he gives hip-hop lovers what they want to hear. Uncle L has changed it up once again by getting assistance from The Neptunes, the trendy producers who have worked with everyone from Busta Rhymes to Justin Timberlake. LL shows an abundance of talent by not using any profanity throughout the album. He also promises to stay true to his millions of adoring female fans with such songs as ""Luv You Better"" and ""You Should"". Ten also features R&B talents such as Amerie and hip-hop mogul P.Diddy. Ten is a fun journey through the life of long time crowd pleaser LL Cool J. Here is a look at the track list.1.Intro2.Luv You Better3.Niggy Nuts4.Clockin G's5.You Should6.Born To Love You7.Paradise8.Mirror Mirror9.Fa Ha10.10 Million Stars11.Throw Your L's Up12.Untitled13.Big Mamma14.Outro"
4,Don't Call It A Comeback!,"First off, for anyone who's wondering, there's only one version of this cd, since he doesn't curse at all. My current favorite song is ""Fa Ha"", which samples Hall & Oates ""Rich Girl"". Other good tracks are the first single ""Luv U Better"" and ""Big Mama (Unconditional Love)"", which features Dru Hill. I totally recommend this album, especially if you liked his previous releases. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that a couple tracks sound corny, like ""Lollipop"" and ""AFter School"" with P. Diddy."
2,Weak stuff...,"This is LL's second straight bad CD and I blame the production more than anything else. LL is past his prime lyrically but he still raps better than 90% of the rappers today. Unfortunately rather than working with some real producers he chose the Neptunes. The Neptunes make me sick. they should stick to working with Nelly and Nsync. Their beats totally don't mix with LL's style. LL needs smooth, simple sound like from ""Around the Way Girl"" or ""Hey Lover"". Not these hard thumping, trying to sound hard but really not, beats the Neptunes use. The only very good song is ""10 Million Stars"" and a couple of other songs like ""Love U Better"" and ""Paradise"" are decent. The rest are almost unlistenable. This is a cd for the diehard LL fan who loves anything with the sound of his voice but otherwise, I would save my money because this album will only tarnish your opinion of one of the greatest rappers ever."
1,Ten is Terrible,I expected a little more from Uncle L. Considering he has been in the business for so long. I don't like this offering from LL.
1,10,in 2002 ll released his tenth album called 10 and wen luv you better came i thought i gotta cop this album and i went and got it but i seriously think this is a rushed project and could of been better the only song i like is luv u better and paradise with amerie i hate this record .
3,thought you was retired uncle L,Ll makes another cd talking about oral sex yeah we know that's why they call him the G.O.A.T. and yes he's still rapping about how much better in bed some woman's husband is other than that not too much's changed features amerie in a neat jam that's worth getting other than that Ll should put the steroids down and stick to acting.
5,just as I ordered,"These are the exact bags I ordered. I used to buy these in stores for a little over $5.00 but they don't sell them in stores anymore, and online they are expensive. This was a good deal through Amazon. Shipping was fast."
1,Don't waste your money,"This was a terrible waste of time and money. I skimmed through it looking for the interesting parts, and found myself at the end - it just isn't interesting. I loathed most of the characters most of the time, even if they didn't have any depths, just their actions were enough to make me hope they weren't successful - dull, dull, dull, too many characters, only reason it's an 'International Novel' is because it's set in Europe. Awful book."
4,A Very Entertaining Read!,"This has been my favorite story by Ms. Johnson so far. L'Affaire combines witty characters, fun locations, and an interesting storyline. Ms. Johnson's books really read like soap opera's which is why I'm drawn to them. This has been one of her better books, with characters that are not too obnoxious and very little American bashing. For a fun way to spend a weekend you can't go wrong with this novel."
2,Weak,"Going over much of the old ground found in her earlier books. Starts interestingly enough but the ending just drops from no where. Ms Johnson would definitely benefit from finding a new theme. The main problem, like many stories, is that the initial idea had some grip, but the author had no grasp of how to bring to a satisfactory conclusion."
1,Ugh.,"I give up. I'd rather fold laundry than keep reading this book. Unlikeable characters, nothing but watching them wait to see what's going to happen, acting very selfish and dull while they do so. BORING."
4,L'Affaire by Diane Johnson/Review by C. O'Neill,"The series of ""L"" books L'Divorse, L' Marraige, are delightful but not frivilous accounts of men and women from various backgrounds, cultures and countries coming together in high and low levels of ""French Farce."" I love them for the pure escape and entertainment. But, don't misread this to mean they are ""fluff"". These books are well written filled with literary,artistic and historical references. The characters are outragious and funny and sensitive. I love Johnson's fairness in her love hate relationship with all things American and Frence. These are a wonderful curl-up read."
2,L'Waste of Time,"My reading group wanted something light for our January read so we selected this book based on a newspaper review in which Ms. Johnson is hailed as a Pulitzer Prize contender. I doubt this book is going to win her any literary awards! L'Affaire had unlikeable, boring characters about whom I was completely uninterested. The plot was silly and bordering on the absurd without being even slightly humorous. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
4,Isabelle Archer Lives!,"Thank you, Diane Johnson, for being a true heiress to Henry James. When clueless Amy meets a cross-section of European, Paris-centric, upperish-crusted, slef-promoters, she shows both brash courage at sticking to her principals of mutual aid, and an open curiosity at how to, if not fit in, then at least not stick out. Unfortunately, her principals and new wealth always make her stick out, bringing into question what American generosity and world-involvement really are and lining her path of good intentions with one corpse and a number of disappointments from those depending on her. If there's a flaw, it's in the unexplored character of the novel's surprise villain -- but when an author is juggling at least eight points-of-view as seamlessly as Johnson is here, well...I for one am in a forgiving mood even if it means a miss on perfection.Brava!"
5,Great product!,"Lane's has great products and this is no different, highly concentrated dry spray with foaming action is great, digs out stains and dirt on auto upholstery and carpets, I will be buying a bigger bottle for sure, great price!"
5,Inspiring... A Brilliant Saga,"Erich Segal is truly one of the greatest novelists of all times, all of his works evoking pathos. ""The Class"" is no exception. Each character has a distinct personality, and the incorporation of real and fictional characters is pure genuis. This is a book I have read over and over again, and enjoyed each and every time. A wonderful, stirring read."
2,Not bad...,"But it was better when it was originally written as ""The Last Convertible"" by Anton Myrer."
4,Takes you back in College,"This book took me back in College where everyone has their own world, ideas, dreams and aspirations. Mr Segal indeed, gave us the emotions we felt, experienced during those times through the adventures of the 5 individuals.I enjoyed reading the book, but after i read ""Doctors"", it seems like a copy of ""The Class""."
1,Embarrassingly bad,"Simultaneously smug and shallow, ""The Class"" was clearly published for no other reason than to make the godawful ""Love Story"" look slightly improved by comparison. You can just picture Segal stroking himself on the back."
2,This class fails,"Skip this over indulgent pile and read ""Doctors"" by Segal instead, better character development, better subject matter and better results."
3,This book was not as good as it is made out to be,"When i started to read this book i heard very good things about it, then as i read through it it kind of lacked something. The swimming terms that Crutcher used were hard to follow at times and the dialouge had alot of cuss words. Over all it was an okay book but not as good as luis sachars Holes."
1,So boring!,"Sorry, ""Staying Fat"" fans, but trying to read the first chapters of this book was a horror! It's not a challenging reading level for me, but among the negative list is bad character introduction, unnecessary details (that make the book long and boring), and just plain boring-ness. I commend the author for creating such a good story idea, but he ruined it by writing the way he did."
3,okay not great,"While I initially warmed to the story of two outcasts who formed an unusual, acerbic friendship, the author's crystal clear political agenda which shone through with an annoying, un-ignorable glare in many scenes put me off. The best authors have the ability to gracefully handle today's ""hot button"" issues via writing without beating the reader over the head. Sadly, this was not one of them.However, most of the characters were three-dimensional (except for the Christians). There is much biting humor in the story, and that was what sustained me through it.Recommended but for liberals only. Conservatives are likely to be annoyed (and with reason) and toss it into the trash."
4,One of the best I've read,"I have a copy of this book which I bought after continually checking out my teacher's copy--I wanted other people to have a chance to read it! I thought the plot was a bit odd, but it was still interesting and very captivating. It made my problems seem a lot smaller, which is a comforting thought!"
3,"Really, Chris?","This book was just plain annoying. Chris Crutcher's agenda was so obvious and obnoxious, it made me mad. Only half the book was spent on the plot, the other half was spent bashing someone for their beliefs and making this one stereotypical character look like a real jerk. The plot and catchy title looked intriguing, but it was hidden too deep underneath the annoying characters. This wasn't the first time this happened with a Chris Crutcher novel. In his other book I read called The Sledding Hill, in which Crutcher also ignores the plot in order to push his own agenda. Had potential, but I was left disappointed."
4,Good Book,This book was a good book for teenagers. It portrays feelings and times that many of those in high school go through. I had the opportunity to hear Chris Crutcher speak twice and through those experiences I learned that he is very sincere in the books that he writes. And this book shows. It was a book that I could not put down. I would recomend it to any Junior High or High school reader.
5,Best book ever,"I picked this up and I couldn't put it down. Awesome. Awesome. It's not just about soem kid staying fat for Sarah Byrnes, it's about just life, sometimes. I really enjoied the debates in CAT class, if only one thing buy the book for that. I think that everything was pretty belivable, and this book took my on a ride of emotions, sometimes making me almost cry.BUY THIS BOOK!!! You won't be sorry."
2,Yuck,"Out of fairness, I feel I must point out I'm not the age this book is targetted for--I'm 22. Still, even if I were younger, I doubt I'd like the book much better. The novel is chockful of dated humor that wouldn't have been that funny at the published date. Also, the characters are static and flat. The plot is unbelievable. It's one of those books that makes you step out of the story's action and say, ""Hey, that could NEVER happen."" Examples of the downright ridiculous things about Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes: Sarah Byrnes, a sort-of heroine, is downright unlikeable depite her sympathy-inducing disfigurement; a student who went to great measures to keep her abortion secret decides on a whim to tell her entire class during a discussion; and police fail to find Sarah's father, who isn't really hiding at all but continues to live in his house."
1,"Loved Athletic Shorts but ""adult HBO"" in Sarah Byrnes... no thanx.","I teach English and I'm always looking for books that will open the eyes of my secondary students. I was excited to read Staying Fat after reading the many positive reviews. The first 67 pages were great, wonderful character development and real problems that most kids suffer through. Then on page 67 I find our dear hero staying up late watching (graphically explained) porno. Excuse me? And he explains that his mother permits it because she is always ""completely open about sexual stuff"". Am I to understand that being ""completely open about sexual stuff"" means having porno in the house? Good parents and good teachers don't expose their children/students to porno."
5,This was my most favorite book that I have ever read.,"""Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes"" was an excellent book. I really enjoyed it. I liked the way that Chris Crutcher wrote and the way that he let the charachters speak freely. The plot was very good and it had a lot of true life put into it. I would recommend it to all of my friends."
5,Friends Stick Together,"""Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes"" is a book about what true friendship may be. Eric Calhoune and Sarah Byrnes stick side by side, no matter what in any situation. During their middle school years, Eric suffered from obesity and Sarah Byrnes had parts of her body that were burned ""mysteriously"" in an accident that no one knows about. ""Moby"", as Eric was called, turns out for the high school swim team and Sarah Byrnes is feeling left out. Soon enough, Sarah Byrnes starts going through some troubles and Moby is there to help her along the way. ""Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes"" is a story of courage, love, and friendship. Take the time to read the book and you will also enjoy it as much as I did."
4,Staying Fat,"Chris Crutcher writes a very established plot in ""Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes"". The book keeps you on the edge of your seat. Eric Calhoune finds a friend in burn victim Sarah Byrnes. When Sarah stops talking and is addmitted to an institute, Eric gets worried. He starts to uncover some of Sarah's past and finds out someone is responsible for deliberatly burning Sarah. There is a good cast of characters in this novel that keep it like what high schools like. This is a good read for anybody wanting some insite of what true friendship is."
5,A Truly Inspiring Book,"This is a fabulous, life changing novel. It grips you in the heart and is not quick to let go. Chris Crutcher deserves numerous awards for his portrayal of deeply hurt, yet humorous characters.This novel deals with delicate subjects; abuse and rejection. It would be hard to handle, but Crutcher writes with such subtle, and sometimes laughing-out-loud humor, that one can appreciate the full affect of the story and not walk away depressed. This is a story of people who conquer the odds and, despite all, come out on top. The nuances of the narrative are unbelievable; to get the full affect, I reread paragraphs numerous times.This is a fabulous for anybody who appreciates the differences in life and who is willing to stand up for the rights of the underspoken."
4,What Do You Think When Your Friend Stops Talking?,"Eric Calhoune, a senior in high school, has a best friend named Sarah Byrnes. Sarah has a grotesque burn covering half of her face and Eric is overweight. When Eric first joined the swimteam, he ate a lot of food so he could stay fat and convince Sarah that he was still her friend. When Sarah Byrnes is admitted into the hospital for not talking, Eric starts to think there is a lot more behind the burn than an accident with a pot of spaghetti sauce. Meanwhile, Eric keeps himself busy with an extremely controversial discussion class and swimteam. Later on, when Eric finds out the truth, he is almost killed.I liked this book's humor and the likable characters. I didn't like how it was so predictable during some parts. I would reccommend this book for a more mature group of readers."
1,Could be alot better.,"While I loved the plot, the way this book is writen makes it very hard to follow. At many times while reading this, it made little to no sense. I would love to see this rewritten so that it makes more sense. I want my money back."
5,Swim Fat Boy! Swim!,"I really enjoyed this book! It was a little slow to start and a tab confusing on the characters because the author tends to switch back and forth between calling his friend and his enemy by their first and last names, but once your over that hurdel its no worries from there. I wont bother to write the synompsis because it seems everyone else beat me to it but I will say that outside of the plot there are also some really juicy undertones of religion and responsibility. I love that! It really makes you think and in my opinion thats what a good book is supposed to do. Five stars!"
4,Loved the ending,"My emotions were pulled all over the place which, to me, is the sign of a writerwho knows what he's doing.Thanks, Mr. Crutcher. Great book.I'll be checking out some of your other books as well even though my own highschool days are far behind me."
3,It was a very well written story.,"""Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes"" is truly a wonderfully written fictional story.It combines real events with a few twists and turns, that keep you guessing to the end.It's all about a boy named Eric and his friend Sarah Byrnes.Sarah has been horribly disfigured since childhood.She got burned during the early stages of her life and has since then had to deal with taunts and jeers about her handicap.Eric tells all about past events that have happned and then tells you the current status of her situation.Sarah lives with her dad who is a rutheless,vile,and terrible person who will stop at nothing to have his way.So,when something unexpected happens to Sarah,Mr.Byrnes' fury is released in all it's glory.He's after Sarah,And he'll do anything in his power to get her back inside his cruel,steel grip.This includes anything,even if it means murder! This is truly a cliff hanging novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the dramatic finish!"
3,Before you let your child read this book....,"Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes by Chris Cutcher was read by my newly 14 year old son for summer reading for school. What concerns me about this book is not the subject matter--although it seems severe. But the language in the book and the reference to porn. Although I am very well aware of what my kids hear when they are away from me, I have a very difficult time accepting that a school would consider this as a book to be read by young,impressionable minds when in fact a school would not allow kids to speak in this manner.My son enjoyed the suspense & the thrill in the book. However, he was the one who told me-Mom this is inappropriate for a kid to read.So, I would just caution parents that are looking at this for their child, to #1 realize that there are hard core, emotionally strong series of events that occur in this book, #2 there is reference to porn & #3 there is strong language throughout this book."
3,A Thin Line Between Love and Hate,"I think Staying Fat for Sarah Byrnes was an okay book. I only give it three stars. The beginning is rather boring and dull. Towards the middle it becomes a bit more interesting, but at the end it was boring and unexpected. I liked it, but not enough, so there is a thin line between my thoughts. I recommend this book to young adults and teens due to the obscene language and violence. I would not allow younger children to read this book with out adult supervision."
4,"It's a really good book, I liked it.","This book is really good. It's mostly about the friendship between a girl named Sarah Brynes(she has scars on her face and hands from being burnt) and a guy named Eric Calhoone. The book tells about what happens to the two in junior high and high school, it kind of has a mystery in it. I suggest you read it and finds out what happens."
4,Matthew's Review,This book is great for kids. Its about a gril that gets burned and her best friend is eric. They are both outcast. Her mother left her and her dad is a crazy man. In this book it will be scary and great to read.
5,An outstanding read for any age...,"Just out of curiosity, I picked up this book from my 15 year old's pile of summer reads. I didn't put the book down until I finished. The only time I put it aside was to wipe the tears from my eyes or move to a quieter location. At 43 years old, I have to say that this was one of the most moving books I've read (younger audience genre) - it is a book that will inspire any age. This story is about friendship, loyalty, life, God, free speech, free thinking, and most of all, compassion. The subject matter is sometimes difficult - as a mother of 3, it was hard to read about the abuse. Sarah's father, as someone mentioned in another review, is one of the scariest characters in fiction - there are parts of the book which will keep you at the edge of your seat. This book has a life lesson for any age!"
4,Comfortable,"I purchased this suit for my 17yr old. He wrestles tournament during the off season and summer, so he needed a suit. I also bought matching shoes. He thought the suit was just a comfortable as his regular suit and it didn't ride or pinch in the crotch area. My son has a tall and slender frame. He generally wrestles between 125 - 138. We ordered the medium and it fits great."
5,Track list,"Disc One (53:44)1) Eternally Good Harvest 3:052) Hermit's Library - Daguerreo 4:193) The Place I'll Return to Someday 3:144) Vamo' alla flamenco 3:005) Frontier Village of Dali 4:526) Soulless Village, Bran Bal 4:277) Dissipating Sorrow 3:448) You're Not Alone! 4:039) Two Unstealable Hearts ~ Behind the Door 3:5810) Rose of May 3:5011) Treno, the Sleepless City 2:4112) Unreachable Desire 4:3013) Final Battle 4:2914) Melodies of Life 3:32"
2,Don't waste your money,"This bowl is just a regular old cereal bowl. It's very attractive and relatively heavy, but it's nothing special--and certainly not worth the $18 I paid for it. Unless you're serving to only 2 people, you wouldn't want to use this as a serving dish, I think."
3,Easy but pretty simplistic treatment of subject.,"As the first in a new series (Vol 2 has just come out) on Swedish immigrants to the US in the 19th century, this book is an easy read. Most readers who are seriously interested in the subject will find it somewhat shallow and overly simplistic. This reviewer will not purchase the subsequent volume(s) for that reason. It is mildly entertaining but the serious reader would be better served by Wilhelm Moberg's four part Emigrant series."
3,Works ok,"The grills warped a little after a half dozen uses. Not enough to stop me from using them, but not something I expected."
1,Moen is Junk,"I'm with the last review, except I'm one of the idiots who throws them out and buys another. Every Moen faucet I've bought lasts about 18 months and then fails. Nothing but junk. I'm on my fourth one now. One was the diverter valve to the sprayer, another the mechanism that operates the cartridge (on Christmas day no less) and another began leaking at the base of the faucet. I've just got my latest Moen 87434 faucet and guess what? Moen, for whatever reason, has changed the design of the connections to the household plumbing supply...same part number but not at all compatible with the previous product. So much for just throwing one out and throwing another in this time."
3,worth the six bucks i paid for it,"good songs for the recently dumped-""i hate myself for loving you"",""little liar"",and""i still dream about you"".need i say more?"
4,The Woman Can Rock Better Than Most Men!,"Anything else said about this album would be redundant. I just can't imagine, for the life of me, why no one has mentioned (are you listening, Amazon?) the fact that Rolling Stone Mick Taylor plays those instantly-recognizable riffs on ""I Hate Myself For Loving You."""
5,"Herbal Healer, Inc.",Glad to find this product in capsules as it is an old remedy and hard to find. Used it to clear up chronic diarrhea and it worked perfectly.
2,Disappointed,"The speaker connection was all messed up, so it made a horrible skipping sound. Unfortunately I was unable to return it. Sad. Sound was kind of tinny, but I could have lived with that, I think."
4,Fun DVD,My kids watched this in VHS format 20 years ago and would watch it over and over. Now my Grandsons are enjoying the DVD as much as their Mom and Aunt and Uncle did.
5,a cultural enjoyment,"I am very eclectic when it comes to music. At the moment, I am really into the afro-french music (to be specific: zouk). This album is incredible. I had heard magic system a couple of times on youtube. After watching their video for the song ""c cho ca brule"", I had come to the decision that obtaining their cd was a must. Since then, I have listened to it countless times. The music gets you pumped and makes you feel as though you are capable of anything."
5,Great CD!,"I first heard of Magic System when I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Cameroon. Now I'm hooked. I originally knew about Bouger Bouger and Un Gaou A Oran. That's why I bought the CD. It's a rare thing to find a CD where you like so many of the songs, but this is definitely the case for me! I can listen to this all the way through without skipping songs! I love it. This music would make excellent dance music. Check out Ambiance A Gogo, it's perfect for dancing!"
4,Bouger bouger!,"Even if you don't speak any French, some of these songs will get you moving. Bouger Bouger is by far my favorite song of the year.Michel"
5,Couldn't do a 4 or less star for Bill Maher ever!,"Well, no I couldn't do a negative review on Maher up to the point of his last dvd which I can't remember the title of at this moment. Bill, as ever, attacks religion with great humor and wit. He always keeps me laughing, to be honest with whatever subject he is dealing with. Even for believers (if they haven't surrendered their sense of humor) this can be entertaining though they may walk away in fear that they will lose their religion!"
4,A GREAT DOSE OF COMMON SENSE,"I found this movie very interesting, filled with lots of facts, very educational and hilarious at the same time. I've been waiting for a movie of this kind for the longest time. Thanks Mr Maher!!!!"
5,Great and Thought-provoking,A funny look at the absurdities of religion and how it causes people to shut down their brain. A must see. :)
5,Awesome!,"This documentary was great. I saw it twice in the theater. The only problem was that the first time I saw it, people were laughing so loud I missed bits and pieces of the dialogue.It was hilarious! Maher points out much of what is wrong with religion. Mainly, he shows that none of the believers he interviews have any good reason for believing what they believe. He shows how ludicrous the whole idea of believing in things based on faith is. It was great. I am pre-ordering it so I can have it the day it comes out."
1,Waste of money,"I ordered Bill Maher's Religulous. Service great. Watched disk, What a disappointment. I like Mr. Maher and expected more. O well! Live and learn. If I could return item for credit, I would. Gary"
1,If it wasn't for the truth!,"While the movie attempts, as so many have tried,to dismiss American Christianity as crazy there is just one small problem! It has the truth equivalency of the Da Vinci Code! My favorite part was how Bill handled the man who supported the view that the holocaust never happened! It most obvious that Bill wasn't happy, yet he does the same thing concerning the historicity of Jesus and the reliability of the Bible. It gives new meaning to hypocrisy! It is easier not to believe then to accept the truth and in the case even make it up! If we dismiss historical truths i guess everything is up for grabs, right! So i guess my view of this movie is that if it wasn't for the truth this could of been a good! Let's face it though how can you take these views or this film seriously, after all, its a comedy and i for one found myself sadly laughing."
4,Zombie Jesus save us.,"I believe that religion is just a tool to cope with the fact there is nothing after death. I think that it is really hard for most people to face the fact that there MIGHT not be anything after death.That no one knows how the world became, so they believe in ridiculous- unbelievable stories that in any other context would be considered fiction just to have an answer, just to have something to believe in. I hope that there is life after death, but I am not willing to believe non-sense to put my mind at ease. This movie does a good job of showing what crazy ideas people will believe. From lizards and aliens to 72 virgins for killing, to zombie jesus, talking snakes, raining frogs, to a forgiving- but extremely jealous god. What part of any of that sounds non-fiction? Great movie! IF your religious this is probably not a movie for you. If you like people looking like idiots trying to justify one religion over others this is for you.--- Say what you will, But this is what i say."
3,Religulous,"I enjoyed the video, but had to watch it in short segments. Too much of it made me sleepy. Some parts were very interesting, others not so much."
2,Bill the self-proclaimed rationalist,"Bill has found some religious people who reinforce the typical stereotype of religious extremists and builds his argument off of that. What I found incredibly interesting was how a self-proclaimed rationalist wouldn't examine both sides of the argument. For example, someone who was truly rational would ask what the bads AND goods are regarding religion. Bill argues that religion IS only bad and ignores all the good that religion has provided society. So while Bill concludes that religion will destroy us, any ""rational"" person could easily claim that it has allowed us to survive so long."
3,Religulous,I bought this for a friend that wanted it. He is not technical and after about 100 times of trying to show him how to use the DVD player we both gave up. I didn't want to watch it and he couldn't. Sorry not the most interesting review but there you are.
1,Uninteresting and nothing new,"I was very disappointed when I saw this documentary. I have been waiting to see it for a long time and when it finally arrived it contained nothing intelligent or new.Bill Maher (who is relatively unheard of down here in Australia) comes across as rude, ignorant and narcissistic. As he interviews the various guests he apparently has no interest in there answers, only in making them look silly. He doesn't let anyone get a word in because he constantly interrupts them. This documentary does not have a lot of content but is merely Bill Maher talking and cutting people off. Even this would be fine if he had intelligent or well researched questions/opinions/thoughts but unfortunately he is an idiot!This documentary presents a shameful view of America to all of us living outside USA."
1,"Doubt is humble, but Bill is not.","I have never been more disappointed in Bill Maher as I have been in this program. While he makes some very strong and interesting points, his pompous attitude that he has the inside scoop turned me off. No religion has all the answers and some would say they have no answers but I would certainly have liked the opportunity to have seen some respect shown to those Maher interviewed, allowing them the opportunity to speak. In dialogue is where one learns of opposing opinions but all Maher seemed to give was his comedic responses and his dislike of anyone who thought different than himself. Not unlike some Christians, Jews, Muslims, to whom he was pointing the finger."
2,"Common , Too Lame","Disapointed , i thought it had more bite to it . Or maybe because i am an Agnostic and i was raised pretty much an atheist is not enough for me . Education and control is the real issue . But hey , enjoy life while you got it ... Good serious and entertaining books on the suject is The Story of B and Ishmael by Daniel Quinn ..."
4,Lampooning stupid ideas,"Bill Maher manages to make a strong argument against religion by poking fun at it. It's a well produced film with many good moments - somehow he managed to find plenty of religious loonies to interview. I guess there's plenty around!If you're a fan of Bill Maher I'd highly recommend this. If you're a ""person of faith"" you're likely to be offended, which is a good thing."
4,Bill Maher takes on the ridiculousness of religion!,A rough and sometimes in-your-face look at modern religions... and their curious-if-not-spurious claims to authenticity.He makes some good points! :-)
4,"A curiosity, good start, not perfect","I liked the premise...seeing that religion is emotional, not rational, and not always leading to the betterment of the planet or mankind. But Bill Maher is not generous to his interviewees, and tries to dissuade folks of their beliefs...how silly... better just to listen with an open mind, not with Mahers already closed mind. A more detached approach would be more valuable, if the maker could get out of his own way and his own prejudices. I'd recommend it with that caveat...pick and choose. Glad i saw it. I'm not sure it will convert anyone. What goes in with mother's milk is going to become a part of a person's core..."
4,Entertaining and thought provoking,"A humorous investigation of some of the rather fairy tale like ""beliefs"" of some of the world's (top 3 mainly) ""Western"" religions."
5,My favorite movie EVER!,"I absolutely LOVE this movie. Bill Maher is a genius that tackles the subject of religion perfectly. He simply asks questions and allows the interviewee explain the unexplainable...which makes the movie funny, enlightening, and just plain perfect. My family watched this movie on Christmas day - which seems a bit wrong to some people - but I think we'll be making a tradition out of it because it actually makes a lot of sense to watch this movie on a religious holiday. Not only did the makers of this movie make it funny, but they actually did a ton of research and I learned many things that I didn't know before."
5,...and the truth shall set you free...,"Wonderful piece of work. It's good to see a spotlight being put people and institutions, who take themselves so seriously claiming to be the only truth, exposed by their own words and actions."
1,Thinly Veiled Hatred For Others,This is nothing but Maher's hatred for others who believe differently than him put to film. You would be better off watching something by Penn & Teller if you want entertainment from the atheist point of view.
2,Doubt?,"This movie preaches the benefits of doubt, but it doesn't really practice it, or at least not enough. It's easy to poke fun at religions and I applaud and commend the necessity of skepticism in times when the sheer brutality of belief can cause so much havoc in the world. But real doubt begins with one's own belief system, and Maher's own attachement to his rudimentary rationalism is sometimes as silly as the idiotic common places of his talking heads.What's really funny in this movie is Maher's stupid rationalism, his belief in reason as a universal common ground. His petty, self assured questions are, at best, sophomoric, and at worst disrespectful of the sheer complexity of the human soul."
1,Bill Maher- RELIGIOUS,"In considering the author, Religious is his cup of tea, at best. My opinion of him as a person is low, as this DVD proves..."
1,Pretty lame...,"I was looking forward to an intellectually stimulating excursion into religion worldwide -- arguments for/against, its effects and interaction with our culture, weaknesses and strengths of various religious systems, etc. Unfortunately, things end up being pretty superficial and relatively low-brow. The focus of the film seems to be biased by Bill Maher's childhood background and Western mindset. Most of his insights seemed more on the side of tired ""cheap shots"" (e.g., do these people really think they're drinking the blood of a guy who died 2000 years ago?) rather than covering anything that resembles interesting new ground... Given this, it's hard to recommend this if you're looking for something provocative that tries to wade into the deep water. On the other hand, for something more on the intellectually calorie-free side of things, this probably is about par for the course and is likely to provide significant entertainment value for the viewer."
1,Unnessecary,"Bill mahar shoots fish in a barrel and gives cannon fodder for religious fanatics to say they are being attacked and mis represented by extremists.Adds nothing to the discussion other than disrespect for religion.As an atheist, these arguments are what you would enjoy in high school, but if you still find it amusing beyond that age, you are missing the point of having higher critical thinking skills."
2,Boring,"Was expecting much more. While he has the thesis correct his presentation is rather boring, disjointed and if it was a written paper it would have received a D+ or C-."
2,"Funny, but ignores some other religious zealots.","I was invited to friends for dinner... and we watched this after a good meal.I found the movie VERY funny. One thing was lacking.Where was an expose of the radical REVERAND Jeremiah Wright style Afro-Centric theology? Politically, was it too sacred for Mr. Maher to attack and ridicule? We saw pictures of George Bush and John McCain and their religious beliefs mocked, but NOTHING about REVERAND Wright and his disciple, Mr. Obama. REVERAND Wright and his beliefs are just as dangerous to us as any of the other religions attacked by Mr. Maher.Therefore my opinion is the movie is unbalanced and attending to a political agenda. But what would you expect from Mr. Maher."
2,"A Bitter, One-sided Diatribe Against Religion","Bill Maher urges atheists and agnostics to unite and reclaim the world from religious delusion. But he considers only the violence, hypocrisy, and idiocy of religion while ignoring the compassion, charity, and inspiration. As much as I'd love to excuse this as entertainment or satire, Maher claims objectivity when much of the movie is selectively edited and downright cruel. If the billions of Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the world should be discredited on the basis of a relatively small number of religious crackpots, then what do the actions of people like Stalin or Mao, who killed millions trying to purge religion, say about atheism?"
5,Very Well Done,"Shows you how whacked out ""NORMAL SOCIETY"" is. Just think, these people that believe in talking snakes think UFO's are crazy. Maher is right in that we need to put religion to rest before mankind can evolve, perhaps round up all of the true believers in the desert and drop an end times H-bomb on them to give them their psychotic wish. Documentary is very well done and shows why the same crooks get re-elected every 4 years by just repeating the same lies that the moronic people keep swallowing. Highly recommended but will depress you."
5,Bill Maher - Superman,"Great movie. Great man. Bill Maher is the voice of reason for our times. Religion is out of control, and Bill flawlessly exposes their hyprocrisy."
1,This was just wrong on so many LEVELS,"I just don't get why so many people loved this ""piece of biased garbage.."" I not a big fan of bill but I thought he would at least make a fair assessment in whatever he was trying to prove about religion..Boy was I wrong! It was a struggle to watch this all the way through. If you want answers, you study and do research Bill. I pray you find the truth bill."
5,If you like Bill Maher...,"If you like BIll Maher you will like the movie, he entertaines will digging into why people believe what they believe."
3,"Not Exactly ""Rigorous""","Maher combines travelogue, interviews, and commentary in a series of confrontations with true believers, designed to get them to expound on their beliefs so he can point out their logical inconsistencies. He makes a number of statements that may or may not be accurate, in terms of history, and tends to provide sound bite summaries of some religions, but he's not comparing faiths; he's challenging the faithful. And while it's entertaining, it's also somewhat shallow."
3,fair and mildly entertaining,I like his political commentary better. This film was not as thought provoking as I expected. My sister had the same thought on it.
4,interesting,Bill pushes the envelope in this documentary. He will make the believer mad. The skeptics happy. The others will be more confused. I enjoyed it.
4,Credulous,"Fans of Bill Maher will recognize his courage in confronting the greatest scam of our times. Most of us grew up believing in Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, God--if one's family believed-- and the Tooth Fairy, but there came a time, usually in grammar school, that we put away childish things and began to deal with reality. For reasons still puzzling to psychiatrists many of us held on to the idea of old Jewish men in bedsheets flying around in the sky. Bill has good time in this film politely skewering beliefs in deities and suggesting that maybe the human race needs to grow up. People who understand scientific principles will know that the time is short."
4,Who can handle the truth?,"Maher is obviously an entertainer with convictions, but like Michael Moore he goes over the top at times with the most extreme, in this case ridiculous religious practices which may turn away some who might otherwise hear and agree about the irrationality of religion. Embedded in the movie is some hard fact that is hard to refute, which makes religious beliefs and icons suspect. Much of what religion does in the name of a god is irrational and idiotic and for all those who blindly follow along I wonder why...fear...anxiety...intellectually challenged? Get over it people there may not be a god, and if there is we will never know what it wants from us, heaven or hell is now, death is inevitable."
2,Religulous,This movie is extremely silly and it is confusing to here the host talk to his imagined audience and at the same time try to conduct an interview with other people at the same time.
1,A shabby work with an obvious anti-religious agenda,"Bill's latest attempt at combining humor and logic instead came out as a mean-spirited attack on one of the founding cornerstones of our republic...the belief in providence/religion as a core value in making us who we are as individuals and as a people. While it is currently popular to be anti-religious in some extreme circles, I'm sorry to see that Mr. Mahar has slid into that slough. He used to be funny. Now he's just cruel."
1,SIMPLY HORRIBLE,"I wanted to give this film a chance, but as a documentary filmmaker, the editing was so deceiving to undermine anybody in the film that Bill Maher did not agree with that I felt lied to throughout the whole thing. Some of the information was interesting, but the editing was so horrendous that nothing could be trusted as what was actually said or done. One of the most MANIPULATED documentaries I have ever seen. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
1,Idiot + Ugly = Bad Combo,"Terrible. Not even funny. I think Paul Theroux said it best: ""Maher is the worst thing imaginable: an ugly idiot with a big mouth."""
1,Lame attempt,"Just more proof that Bill is desperately trying to hang on to his waning relevance. Religion like politics seems like easy fodder on the surface - there seems to be so much wrong with them today that it's too easy. Wake up! We are all tired of this side line whining - do something that will make a difference.What Bill fails to see in this lame attempt of a film is that what little influence he has left in this world has been misguided. There are other pursuits that he could use his celebrity for that might actually do more than provide some additional air to an already over-inflated ego.Bill, do us all a favor and make a film on a topic you actually know something about. This was plain drivel focused on religion to get media attention."
2,Gutless Wonder Makes Movie Bashing Christians,"EVERRRRYBODY BASHES Christians and Jews---even Christians and Jews. I thoughtthis movie would be an even handed bashing of most major religions---especiallyIslam. Christians have easily absorbed criticism; BUT, making fun of Islam?You gotta have balls.You call the last few minutes of this movie 'Brave'? As it takes on Islam.Fluff.Genghis Khan studied the major religions of his time:Hinduism? A danger. Judism? A danger.Buddhism and Christianity? A good religion for slaves.Islam? A danger; BUT, a great religion for warriors and slave owners.Years after The Great Khan's death, the Golden Horde was set to destroyMecca and Medina when Islam was saved by the death of Kubla Khan asChristianity was saved by the death of Genghis Khan."
3,"funny, but....","funny interviews, but a very biased viewpoint. This video only told what the author meant to tell in support of his position. Many of the interviews had been clipped and twisted...funny at times, but not something to base your life off of. Oh, and some of the ""facts"" he used were completely bogus...like the Egyptian god's life being the same as the life of Jesus...Check it out from any real Egyptian historian and read the Egyptian texts."
2,chip on his shoulder,"I usually love this sort of thing, but it was off-putting. All I kept thinking was ""Wow, that is an enormous chip on your shoulder!"" I am one who has considered and pondered the many religions and the difficulty of proving their claims. Many things are also ridiculous to me! I just couldn't get past his treatment of those who had a different opinion than his."
2,A disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this movie but it fell short. It is hard to respect Bill Maher as a non religious person when someone says they used to party and sleep around and then they turned their life around, and Bill says ""what was the problem before?"" One of the worst points of the movie is that Bill obviously plays it in the ""safe zone"" and only goes after Christianity. It is easy to make fun of Christianity in our culture because we've had it shoved down our throats...how about exploring some other organized religions? He also should have talked to some religious scholars and not just crazy evangelicals. He is also one of those people that sees things in black and white- as in organized religion doesn't make any sense so that must mean there is no god at all."
1,Hollow,"Maher's interviewees are either dim-witted or already on Bill's side. If you like this one, you'll probably also like to watch an hour and 40 minutes of somebody shooting fish in a barrel. There was a few legitimate laughs when Bill points out the hypocrisy in religion, but even these had diminishing returns as the movie progressed. If you hate religion and you're looking to fuel that fire, this is a good movie for you. If you are interested in a documentary that reflects reality in a humorous way, you're out of luck.Update:Put another way, this movie is the spiritually ignorant laughing at the spiritually ignorant with only a pretense of legitimate religious material - and thus only a pretense of religious humor. But, if you like that kind of thing, as many other reviewers apparently do, by all means stay in the shallow end of the pool."
2,"Hollywood's smug view on religion,",Religion can be good because it provides people with a moral compass that is higher than what surrounds them. I would encourage readers to google 'white rose Nazi Germany'. This is an example where good people (a minority of people) chose not to subscribe to an earthly authority that was lower.
1,Mahr's lack of subtly/ comedic style hurts his ability to make his point,"In a nutshell: Maher is preaching to the converted. If you already agree with him (that religion doesn't make sense any more for his reasons) completely you'll love it. If you don't, you probably won't like this movie at all.I rented this movie anticipating that I would enjoy it, but was quite disappointed. Instead of being enjoyable in a humorous way, or in a serious and subtle/gentle way, it was a long rant by Maher. I know this is what he is famous for, but this rant made him come across as obnoxious and mean and made me WANT to disagree with him, even when I didn't. He also pushes every point too far, and therefore hurts his argument even more. Maher gets to speak with some very interesting and/or important people in this, but doesn't seem to really listen to them. His mind is already made up. Lastly, if you've ever had a college logic class, you'll recognize that he commits just about every logical fallacy."
1,Ridiculous,This movie is petty. Maher takes aim and shoots fish in a barrel. This movie is about as intelligent as some of the people it mocks. It doesn't attempt to enter into any kind of illuminating dialogue or investigation of religion. It only ridicules. If you're into that kind of thing - ridiculing people and their beliefs - then this movie is for you.
5,"Bill Maher, atheism, and a whole lot of religious discussion. Can it get any better?","Bill Maher talks plenty about religion on his show, but I found this movie to add even more hilarity and more to his perspective. Good movie, definitely recommending it for a watch."
5,movie,I was very satisfied with the buyer the movie purchased came exactly according to their descriptions would love to continue business with the seller :)
5,Entertaining & Smart,"I loved this movie - it will offend, enlighten, and tickle your heartstrings. Bill Maher is an equal opportunity offender in this satire that pokes holes into ""Magical Thinking"" and religion."
1,Poorly researched with poor sources,"The main theme of this film seems to be ""let's find the most ridiculous representations of each of these religions to prove our point."" I can find 20 of the biggest idiots in America which will show you that all Americans are loony idiots, but that doesn't mean that we are. The only good source is Francis Collins, and my guess is that his piece is so short because he didn't say anything ridiculous so it didn't fit into Maher's agenda. My guess is that he didn't try to get reliable sources or they just wouldn't speak with him.If you want a good laugh, then this film does a good job at providing some humor and showing some crazy people out there. But if the point is to really look at the validity of religion, this film is ridiculous - which is what I'm sure the goal of the film was - to show religion as ridiculous. It is a very biased approach."
1,Bill Mahar is funny?,Bill Mahar should have quit show business after the movie Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death. This was on par with that but not as funny.
2,religulous,"he did not make a strong point in my view, although the are very good part in it i wanted to see a better foundation,it is good to see it once but not to often."
1,Revolting production from a diseased mind,"This is simply a lazy, dishonest piece of agitprop by one of the most revolting and vile human specimens I've ever seen. All he does is go up to simple, unsuspecting people and ambush them with insulting comments about their religions, which they are ill-prepared to defend. Did Maher really think he was so brilliant because he was able to baffle a bunch of truck drivers with some sophistic assertions about Christianity? Maher would have more credibility if he had the guts to match his snarky agnosticism against a real theologian with experience in apologetics. But Maher knew that he would have been the punchline in such a match-up."
1,2 hour rant,"Maher's mockumentary IS anti-religious. He says, ""Religion MUST die in order for man to improve."" He interviews people, but rarely lets them speak because he is busy deriding their opinions. His criticisms are typically mean-spirited and arrogant. He says essentially, ""I don't believe this so it must not be true. You should not believe it either."" The disturbing thing is that he suggests eliminating people of a religious bent from public debate and public policy making. I wonder what other people groups who have distasteful worldviews Maher will also suggest eliminating. I watched this video at the suggestion of a colleague. It was less than I expected."
1,It's Bill alright,"Hate filled smug militant atheism... expect anything else?Goes after Christians with impunity without diving into other religions too much.What about Islam, Billy?"
1,This guy is a real Jerk.,Well yes we all understand that religion and Santa Clause fill the same niche in the spectrum of human imagination. But NO you don't have to be so harsh and inhumane when dealing with practitioners of any faith based dogma. He is lucky that no one slapped him silly during his interviews. He really did deserve it.
1,childish and sophomoric,Bill Maher is washed up and boring...he attacks the easy to attack and doesn't actually debate anyone worthwhile....rubbish
1,"Meh, just watched this old movie and...","Had someone other then Bill, say Carl Sagan, done this movie, it might have been a 3 or 4 star movie. I agree with the other reviewers that he was simply preaching to the choir. Also, I would have given it 2 or 3 stars had he actually pushed on his questioning of the Muslims he interviewed as hard as he did the Christian ones. He showed his cowardice a bit there. And it seemed after a bit as though he was intentionally picking the worst representatives of each faith. With the exception of the Catholics he spoke with. Oddly, they came across very well for their faith. Overall, had it not been free, I would not have watched nor recommended anyone else watch."
1,Glad I watched it free on TV,"Some people will do anything to make money it seems. I am a Catholic (which is the same as saying I am a Christian) , and believe in the Bible. I thought this was going to be more serious but he did interview a lot of quacks. I think most of the preachers on TV take acting lessons before preaching, and people send them lots of money. they live high off the hog, so exposing them was good.All the people he interviewed save a couple were out in left field to say the least.Mr Maher , its not too late to be saved, and I pray you find your way."
1,stupid,"I haven't seen it, but I see liberals do this all the time to conservative books..... Bill Maher is a pig and is not funny - I know that without watching this dumb movie. Some day, God is going to toss his sorry butt into hell"
1,FOOLISH,THE BIBLE SAYS A FOOL SAYS THERE IS NO GOD. I PRAY BILL FIND OUT GOD EXIST BEFORE ITS TOO LATE. BECAUSE HE WANT BE LAUGHING WHEN HE IS STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM GIVING HIM ACCOUNT FOR HIS LIFE. IF HE WANT TO KNOW IF GOD EXIST HE SHOULD TRY BREATHING ON HIS OWN. I BELIEVE THE ENEMY HAS TRICK HIM AND HIS LAUGHING AT HIM AND ALL THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE. YOU BETTER READ PSALM 14. AND YOU BETTER HOPE GOD DON'T EXSIT OR YOU ARE IN EXTREMELY HOT TROUBLE. JESUS LOVES YOU AND WANTS YOU TO BE SAVED. READ ROMANS10:9-10. DON'T LET SATAN CONTINUE TO FOOL YOU. GOD BLESS YOU.
1,How original,"Maher is neither original nor funny in this mean-spirited film.I am a believer, but I don't insist that everyone must think like me. Many of my best friends are still searching for their truth, and that's fine with me. They are good people.I understand that it's fashionable to slam anyone who believes in God, it's socially acceptable to many.It is not, however, to me. It is no better to make fun of a believer than it is to poke fun at a non-believer. How about trying this: let everyone think/believe what they want, as long as they are good people?Maher is a fool, and it should be pointed out that his intolerance is part of the problem, not a solution. He's jumping on the bandwagon and collecting his paycheck while mocking a whole segment of society simply because they don't agree with him.For the record, I feel the same way about those who call themselves religious yet mock and terrorize those who don't think as they do. They are ALL in the same boat.Maher needs a lesson in tolerance."
1,Bill Maher is an irrelevant individual,"I chose not to waste two hours of my life watching what is certainly another one of Bill Maher's attempts to cram his personal views and opinions down everyone's throats.Whether Maher is making one of his all-too-frequent visits to The Tonight Show in order to satisfy Jay Leno's left-slanted agenda, or any of his other undeserving television appearances, this overbearing piece of slime seems to thoroughly believe in his mind that whatever he thinks is right. And god forbid you have a differing view than Maher, because if you are not right in line with Maher then he will be sure to ridicule you with his smurky and arrogant manner.It's too bad that someone such as Bill Maher gets as much attention as he does. This man is completely irrelevant and does not deserve the least bit of attention. Except for perhaps a clip on the news about him getting crushed by a garbage truck.Maher and garbage, quite fitting."
5,Religulous review,This is a good comedy first and foremost. It also shows some of the foolishness and really down right retarded stuff these religions believe and preach. Maybe one day these religous freaks will realize there brains do work if they try to use them.
1,Poorly researched...,"Have you seen Bill Maher's movie ""Religulous""? Apparently Mr. Maher got his information from the documentary Zeitgeist (Part 1). Both made mention of claims that there are many stories predating Jesus but which have striking parallels (insinuating that Jesus was a copycat).I decided to follow up on these claims and see what kind of information was out there to substantiate or refute these assertions. The following is what I found:[...][...]Enough said! :/"
5,Brilliant!,A completely in your face documentary. It was like watching the Colbert Report only about religion... and only the parts where he makes the interviewee trip over their words. Excellent Excellent movie.
4,Movie Review of Religulous,Very funny movie to watch & worth the rental. Makes you think about how others think.
5,Great - 5 stars due to a lack of this type of programing.,"Great insights along with some humor.This movie is not meant to be a full-on comedy. It is more along the lines ofLetter to a Christian Nation (Vintage)orThe God Who Wasn't There(both of which I highly recommend) with a heavy dose of humor.I give this 5 stars due to a huge lack of this type of programming , especially in america. I would probably rate this 4 stars just due to the production could have been a little better.Highly Recommended regardless.Once you have seen the above suggestions I would urge you to move up a notch and read:Atheist Universe: The Thinking Person's Answer to Christian Fundamentalismand then the amazingThe God Delusion"
1,Disappointed,"I was looking for something funny and irreverent (I used to be able to count on Mahar for that), instead I got a lecture on religion from an atheist. Very boring."
1,Weak.,"Bill Maher's knowledge of the Bible is absolutely laughable. But who he goes to to answer his questions in the movie is even more laughable. Come on, Bill. Can't you do better than truckers to get your theological questions answered? I'm not a theology major, but I could answer the questions better than most of the people he interviewed. Except in the instance of Ken Ham. That was just creative editing.This film will appeal to anybody who is weak in their faith or doesn't believe at all, so in that case it isn't a true documentary at all. To be a documentary you have to state facts and since Bill doesn't even know the facts himself....well, ya know."
1,Laughable... Should work with Michael Moore,"""Facts"", ""Truths"", and contrived scenes make this worthy of a modern day Three Stooges comedy... Skip this one and save your self the time wasted in this ""investigative"" piece."
1,"Scandalous, Terrible, and Frightening","This is a very liberal approach to religion. Maher hopes to approach Christianity by finding people and confronting them and hoping to create doubt with anyone who watches. I fear for Maher, and our Nation who would seek promote such Godlessness. I hope that anyone who sees this will see what kind of filth this is and leave it alone. Don't touch it, don't watch it. I'm sorry I have."
1,What An Idiot,"Bill Maher is a sick, twisted little man who lies and cheats to prove his points. His vomit-inducing agenda never offers both sides of the coin, and he is a disgusting excuse for a human-being. Instead of watching his propaganda, petition Amazon to remove all his content so no one will accidentally stumble upon this odious rubbish."
2,Too disjointed to be realy effective,"I write as someone generally sympathetic to Maher's views. My problem is not with those, but with the way the film is put together. After 30 or so very funny opening minutes, it gets bogged down and tiresome....too much of the same kind of sendup, repeated and repeated with diminishing returns to the viewer. Would have been much better with a firmer editorial hand."
2,Bill the lousy interviewer,"The concept of the movie is good, unfortunately Bill Maher has a bad habit of interupting the people he is supposed to interview. The clips from other movies is clever, but the host keeps getting in the way."
1,Feel sorry for this guy,"Cant stand this guy, Just like George Carlin, he wont be laughing too much when he fades into the night. Why is it that everyone interviewed is always so inept- must be coincidence. If you have real questions about God and how he wants to save us, check out GCCCpray.com No fact in the Bible can be disputed it was all fact. We either choose to believe or not. The Bible says ""the fool says in his heart there is no God"". To me it takes a lot more faith to believe that this world is just some big accident than that it is the creation of a divine God whom loves and cares for us. Peace"
3,All Religious Beliefs Insane Except for the Secular Zionist Jew,"The hidden subtext of this film is that All religious beliefs are insane except for those of the secular, agnostic or athiest Zionist Jew. In the final third the Zionist anti- Arab propaganda kicks into high gear. Bill is a shill. Be aware."
1,Trash Film,Bill Maher is as annoying as the nut cases he interviews. Trash film at its worst. A waste of time.
2,Disappointing,"I have to say I was disappointed with this video and I am writing the review purely on the movie rather than the theme or from any religious viewpoint. I thought Bill would have thought a little more about it and used his wit and sense to really take off on a theme that was given to him on a platter for exploitation.The movie was slow in parts, not properly welded together and did not appear to have a good development plan based on the topic. In fact, it seemed to even have lacked any solid thesis up front that would have helped to guide his efforts. Had he sat down and used the services of a proper documentary crew and planned the video the result would have been far different. It just seems like a concoction of events that he thought of as he got up each day. I would have given it one star but added another solely because the idiots he interviewed provided some comic relief, albeit few and far between."
2,Ill researched and offensive,"I don't know if Bill Maher did any research for this, or if he just looked up stuff from wkipedia, but this movie contains a lot of stuff spouted as historical fact that is blatantly untrue (the whole Mythras section is garbage).It's also highly selective, with the most stinging critisism directed at Islam, even to the extent of interviewing, without critism, uber racist Geert Wilders.In the end it's guilty of doing exactly what it critisizes, people of power spouting rubbish to the gullible to bend them to their will.It is quite funny though."
1,One sided monologue.,"More of a comedy, and self-aggrandizing spectacle than a documentary. Maher is a joke, but he doesn't seem to know it."
4,Entertaining look at the world's various religions.,"I don't really care for Maher's views on other topics such as gun control, but he is home in familiar elements with this film. You just have to see the way he engages people, to get them to open up to him about their faith. Of course, it only makes them look like fools in the end.Do we have too much religion in the world? Definitely. This film proves it."
3,A documentary in the style of Michael Moore,"'Religulous' has comedian Bill Maher making a documentary in the style of Michael Moore about religious belief, though he does not quite achieve Moore's deft humor, artful storytelling, or emotional resonance. Maher expresses his lack of belief, talks to various believers, presents some historical information, and interviews a few experts. The doc primarily contains jokes, but Maher does seem sincere in his efforts to better understand religion. It is entertaining and informative, but it's not quite up to Moore's level of documentary filmmaking. I think ""Monty Python's Life of Brian"" does a better job of humorously critiquing religious belief. Reviewed 3/29/2009 after watching on DVD."
3,Was just OK,"Religulous was an ok movie in mybook. Some funny interviews by Bill Mahr.If you like Bill Mahr, I would see this movie"
4,"Great Product, Hate Spamming After Purchase",Purchased these glasses for a devout stout drinker. He loves these glasses and drinks out of them often. What is a big drawback are all the spamming emails and catalogues from Creative Irish Gifts.
2,Why did I buy this?,"I did not need another Otello, much less one with the same Otello as my other one. I guess it was Cheryl Studer that lured me into this. And indeed her performance is good, more than capable but not great.This is not the best Otello of Domingo on record-for me that would be the one with Milnes and Scotto, a cast that I saw perform it on several occasions and each performance was rapturous. Two problems with this set: there is no chemistry between the performers and more important it is sloppily conducted. Chung conducts as if he is late for something and is hurrying to get out of the studio and on to his next appointment. The first act flies by so fast it seems to be over before it begins.Anyone want to buy a second hand copy?"
4,Good but better in live performance,"In order to enjoy a Plácido Domingo Othello is much better watching him in live performance. That is because he takes his voice to the limit would recomend the recording of Renata Tebaldi at this opera. For listening Othello at home I and Mario del Monaco. I thinck that Mario del Monaco, even Franco Corelli, are better Othellos. However I have this Placido Domingo recording and I enjoyed it."
5,"Brilliant overall, disagree on casting","I have to disagree with those here who thought Leiferkus was not an excellent choice as Iago. This version was the first Otello I've ever listened to, and I immediately spotted Iago's entrance. I was, however, disappointed with the casting of Desdemona. It was not that I thought Studer does not have a wonderful voice; she does. It was not the voice of an ingenue, however, and particularly in Verdi's composition of Shakespeare's story, she is a very passive character in the story. I felt a more innocent, softer, sweeter voice was called for."
4,Good orchestation and good Domingo,"In this version we find a good orchestation conduced by Chung and also a very good performance by Placido Domingo. Leiferkus solves Yago's role with his metallic and powerful voice. His Credo en un Dio crudele is full of quality. The only spot is the average Studer as Desdemona. She is not convincing.In other reviews I read that Vickers is considered the best Othello. In my opinion the best recording is Karajan version with Mario del Monaco, Renata Tebaldi and Tito Gobbi. Del Monaco is Othello, the most powerful and darkness voice. Tebaldi and Gobbi are excelent. I recomend to those think Vickers is the best."
4,Interesting collection.,"This book is a collection of short stories, each a snippet of the life of one of the hosts of the Dax symbiont, from the first host (Lela) to Jadzia, with an opening and closing frame of Ezri Dax. Each story is told by a different author, and all are quite good. As a whole, the collection is interesting if not compelling."
5,The great stories of the amazing Dax,"This collection of stories tells parts of each Dax's hosts. With many different authors, some Star Trek veterans, and others new to the show (so to speak), this book has amazing details to it. Almost every story has at least one familar name in it. If you like Dax in general, or of its hosts, then this incredible book is a must."
4,A very enjoyable read.,"The reason I got this book is that Jadzia Dax is my favoriteDS9 character, and the Trill species is interesting. Although it'snot the best trek book I've ever read, I only have one real problem with it and it was never boring at all. The problem I have with it is that in the Jadzia part, the author portrays her in the flashbacks as pretty much the same as she is on the show, and not at all shy and naive like she was supposed to be before joining. It had very interesting stuff about Trills, and complied with the show pretty well. But before you judge trek books based on this one, read the Invasion series, the Dominion War series, and Q-Squared."
3,Lives of Dax,"I have read all the previous reviews before posting my own. Since each of these reviews tells you what the book is about, I will tell you how I feel about the book without the details of the book which is covered in other reviews.When I bought this book, I had expected more. Although each story gives an insightful detail of the different lives of Dax, I cannot help ending each story a bit disappointed. I had hoped for more details on each one of those lives. I suppose this cannot be helped as there is only one book to take in all the details. There is no real build up of tension. They are just stories of each of the lives of Dax. There are a number of excellent stories and I agree with most of the review. I posted an average rating because I feel the book tries to do too much with so little space and came up lost.I would still strongly recommend this book to anyone who would like to read more about Dax."
2,as disconnected as Ezri is,"This book was too quick of a read. For people as seemingly interesting as Dax's hosts have been, a ten to twelve page story about them just doesn't work. The lines are double spaced and the print is large. I felt like I was reading a paper from school where someone is trying to fill as much space as possible. The authors are relatively unknown to the Star Trek universe and it shows. I think if they would've put regular writers to the task, or even made the books a trilogy set, we would've had something worth while but as is, it's a short book that you gain nothing from. Like other people have pointed out, some of the stories aren't even from the view of the host. All in all, it's a very weak book that doesn't deserve the rating it has."
3,Condition,I believe the books quality was over sold. But it is an old book and children enjoyed it any way so no harm done.
4,very worried walrus,This is a book about a walrus who is very worried about riding a bike. He keeps on thinking that something could happen to him. Then his friend tells him to try it so he does he has fun and then he crashes into a tree. He gets up and is all fine.
5,Desert Island Disk,"I've had this recoridng for the better part of 10 years and return to it often. It's simply amazing. These are first rate chamber pieces played to pieces by outstanding muscicians. Rich, vibrant, soaring and firey are a few adjectives to describe this incredible coupling. Buy this disk!"
5,My husband loves it,"I bought this watch for my husband's birthday because so many good reviews and images.it turned out it was a good present, my husband loves it, the watch suface is very clear to see."
4,A Very Nice Watch,Pros: Attractive design. Near perfect time-keeping. Eco-Drive is cool.Cons: The band sucks. It's ugly green canvas and the holes are large and metal. The second hand on my watch is slightly misaligned with the marks if you are really picky.Overall I would recommend buying it. Just put a different band on it.
5,Citizen field watch,"The watch is exactly what I wanted and exactly as advertised. I love the look and it keeps great time. In my opinion the cost is more than reasonable and I'm surprised the it didn't cost more. The band is stiff but my previous watch had a leather band that cracked, so I wanted a canvas band for its durability. This band should last for years."
5,If you work nights like I do...,"then you can really appreciate this watch's dial. The number and hands including the second hand are clearly seen in the dark. My only complaint and suggestion to Citizen would be at add a military dial 13-24. There is plenty of room on the dial for the numbers.As with everybody else, I am not a big fan of the green wrist band. As soon as it wears out, I plan to replace it with a Black Speidel sports watch band similar to the type that I have on my other watches."
1,Malfunctioned after A WEEK...,The movement simply broke after A WEEK. Afterward gave me unreliable time and the date function stopped working properly. Last time I buy a Citizen watch.
5,Great watch,"The package arrived ontime, and once I got the watch on I really liked it. It's not too big or small, super easy to set date and time. I got a leather arm band to change out with the one it came with, so the watch can look a little more formal. 5 star for price and quality"
5,Love this watch,This watch is sleek and keeps great time. I've never had an issue with the watch not charging. Looks great with other black leather bands as well.
5,great watch - highly recommended,"All in all a very nice watch - feels solid and well made. Luminosity of hands and numbers is better than I have seen before with my previous Wenger Swiss military watches. The canvas strap is very comfortable, and its nice that you don't have to remove any links. My only complaint is a small one regarding the day/date window - the hands are quite thick (hence the good luminosity)and block out the day/date window everyday around 3:15. But I guess if you don't know what day it is by 3:15 maybe you don't need to know. Anyway it is not a major issue and I like the watch enough to give it 5 stars."
3,Good watch,"Quick shipping, and decent lamination at night, lume lasts about 8 hrs. Was hoping for more, but it's still readable in the early hous of the morning. Seems to be pretty tough, but I'm pretty hard on a watch, so most don't get through a year before failure.. S far I have cracked the lens, but that's my fault. The watch still works well, even with a nasty crack, and it is still water resistant... So I think it's pretty awesome!!!!"
5,Give the band some time,"I got this watch after reading the reviews on amazon. The watch itself is excellent. Most of the complaints have been about the canvas strap.I too was disappointed with the strap at first. But give it some time, and you will ignore the strap, and see how beautiful the watch looks on your hand.As someone else has suggested, if you so hate the strap, just replace it. The watch is still worth the money."
4,"nice, easy to read watch with eco-drive, poor band","I purchased this watch quite a while ago and like it - with exception of the horrible band; it is a fairly narrow (18mm) cloth band, with holes for adjustment. I haven't really used the watch yet, looking to replace the supplied band with wider metal or Velcro band. The supplied band is 18mm wide all the way; there must be an alternative that fits the 18mm mount but gets wider past the band mount. With better band the watch would get 5 stars from me. Overall a great deal on easy to use easy to read Citizen watch, as long as you don't mind an ugly narrow band or are willing to replace it.EDIT: Replaced the nylon/cloth strap with twenty-five dollar stainless steel band; love the watch now, 5 stars. I'll post the image side by side with nylon strap for comparison."
5,Great Watch! Great Price! Totally Happy,Work Perfectly got charge in the morning no problems yet and also arrive Before the day i was suppost to recived :D
4,good but luminosity lacking,I think this is a great watch although I do feel I have to make a conscious effort to keep it charged. I even put it on the laundry line on sunny days. To fully charge the watch requires a lot of days of sun. You get 11 hours for 2 minutes in full sun. My biggest problem with this watch is the poor luminosity. Immediately after bring the watch in from outside it's fully luminous for some minutes but other than that I can barely see the time in the dark. One of the reasons that I got it was so that I can see the time in the dark so although I gave the watch a 4 star rating I was tempted to give it a 3.
5,Quality deployment watch,"I bought this watch while deployed to replace one I had bought at the Base Exchange that just randomly stopped working. I've now owned it for around two months. The wrist strap is not an issue for me. I LIKE the canvas olive drab color and after wearing ti for a week or so it is pretty comfortable. The watch its self is outstanding. It has never had a failure of any sort or needed to be reset. In addition, the crystal seems to hold up decently well to scratches. I would buy this watch again, especially for the price. Any watch that can perform flawlessly in this part of the world, doing what I do, deserves 5 stars."
4,nice... Straight forward watch,"Bought this for my son. He really likes the size of the watch,the size of the numbers, and the simplicity. He didn't want extras - just a straight forward watch and this delivers. The only drawback is the strap. He would like it longer so it isn't so tight around his wrist."
3,"great watch, but Fabric Strap is a disgrace","Watch is highly accurate (it appears to be 3 secs fast per week)nice looking (if you like ""military""), solid feel.Watch is unexpectedly heavy for ""stainless steel"".Is part of the body brass ?I would have preferred ""brushed stainless steel"" anyway.The surface looks shiny as if ""nickel plated"".Not the ""outdoor"" finish, it appears to have in the photograph.The BIG disappointment however was the fabric strap:After one week (only) of inserting the strap into thesleeve guide, the little sleeve was blocked.Reason, the inside of the sleeve is NOT sewn,but GLUED (with contact glue ?).I now have a big mess, where the strap-end (the partwhich is inserted into the sleeve) is all sticky/ gueywith this glue.I tried re-glueing with a ""will be solid after curing"" wood glue.Not a good idea, looks awful.Really disappointed in CITIZEN, at this price($89.-) they should be able to do better."
2,Disappointing,"I had a couple of Citizen watches, they were solid and long lasting. Unfortunately, this one is not.Attracted by the eco-drive mechanism, I decided to buy one. The watch's movement is excellent and innovative. Unfortunately, the workmanship really makes this watch a disappointment.1) second hand does not line up ( even my $10 watch has all hands lined up perfectly )2) date/day setting mechanism broke, repaired under warranty3) rust ( never seen this before on 1 year old watch ) on the bottom4) uneven brightness on the numbers5) cheap hands, made of filmsy materialFor the price of the watch and Citizen brand, they are major flaws...."
3,a little disappointed,"I liked the look of the watch which was the reason I bought it. I knew I'd be replacing the band, which I did with an oiled leather. But the thing that bothers me is that the second hand doesn't line up with the minute marks. That's a pet peeve of mine.It is not really easy to read in the dark--better than nothing but not like other watches I've had.It looks good and keeps good time though I haven't checked it."
4,GREAT WATCH,VERY NICE FOR THE MONEY. IT IS A GOOD SIZE. UNLESS YOU LIKE HUGE WATCHES. I DID NOT LIKE THE BAND. IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND TOO SMALL FOR ME AS I HAVE A LARGE WRIST. I REPLACED THE BAND WITH A WATERPROOF DIVE BAND AND NOW ITS PERFECT. I HAVE NOT TAKEN IT OFF FOR 2 WEEKS. IT IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND KEEPS PERFECT TIME.
2,"Looks great, but (for me) feels horrible.","I got this watch one day and returned it the next. I loved the design, and the size was just right for my wrist (which is just under 7 inches in circumference). The design is such, however, on the back of the watch where the band attaches, that each of those four points rests very sharply against the wrist (particularly the top one on the righthand side). This is especially noticeable if you replace the existing two-piece strap with a one-piece nylon strap like the Martac Mil series. I'm ordering a different citizen watch that doesn't have these sharp points on the underside.This is definitely a subjective thing, so don't let it prevent you from trying this great watch, just don't be surprised if this is a problem for you too."
4,A good everyday watch,"The watch arrived and is as advertised. Online pictures are very accurate. The numbers are easy to read during the day or at night. The watch is very durable in terms of everyday usage. I have seen complaints about the strap before - I don't have very large wrists, so it fits me fine. However, I could see an issue if you had wide wrists. Overall - the watch is a great everyday watch that is reliable, durable, and also economical."
5,Great watch. Band is no problem for me.,"I love this watch. Style is great. The band is fine. It fits well. It was a little stiff the first few days but easy to insert the end in the loop now. I've had it about a month. I like the metal grommets both for style and function. Others complain about the band. I have no problems with it. There are 7 grommets. I fit best at the center one with three empty on each side. Small wrists? Maybe so. I always figured I had medium wrists. Regardless, this watch is great for me.04/06/2012It's been over three years and I still love this watch. But the band is showing wear now so I'm replacing it. I'm ordering the exact same band as it is still working great for me and I still love the style. Great band. Three+ year life is good for a watch band for me. Couldn't find just the band on Amazon but a web search found another vendor pretty easily."
4,Good Watch,"The watch is very good but, the day date could be a little larger and the hands are not as visable at nighht as I would like."
4,great watch,...looks and functions well...except for the silly grommets on the band...which are not depicted in the photo...even my sister said ...what's with those holes on the band...wondered about a getting new band...for a watch I just bought!...ended up prying the suckers off...more easy than you think...start with the inside of the band and pry the ring off then push the grommet out the other side...did it using my fingernails...which needed to be trimmed afterwards...<g> left one for the hole that I use...now it looks even better...citizen find a new band!...
2,Disappointing poor quality watch,"As in my other Citizen (a GMT ecodrive) the hands don't line up at 12 o'clock and the luminova is unevenly applied. Manufacturing glitches seem to be common with this brand, which is unfortunate because their solar technology is basically a good idea, it just needs a better execution."
4,"Fine, but not as advertised","My Citizen Eco-Drive canvas strap watch BM8180-03E arrived today. The watch is fine. But it came with a gray strap, not the olive green strap advertised. I wanted the green strap. Also, the strap has at least two too many grommeted buckle holes. It does not have a screw-down crown."
2,Citizen Watch Review,"Although the watch looked nice, it certainly didn't perform well. The date function advanced two days (instead of one) on three separate occasions. I returned the watch for a refund."
5,Two years in and still a fan,"I like the look of this watch (esp when considering the price). Ive had mine for two years and its held up nicely. I did swap out the watch band a few months back, but it was worth it."
4,Nice functional watch,"The watch is exactly what I was looking for - functional, easy to read, has numbers instead of lines and Eco Drive (no batteries).What is missing is a perpetual calendar but for the price I can make the adjustment.The band is fairly stiff and the jury is still out on that.Very happy with the watch overall."
5,Great Timepiece.,"Watch is a great bargain, keeps perfect time so far after a good charge cycle; band is so-so, not good looking but fits; will change this out for NATO or similar at some point in near future. Would buy this again."
4,Citizen's Military Watch,I am very pleased with size of this watch. It is the right diameter and the thickness is good.The band is comfortable and looks to be very durable. The face is easy to read in daylight.However in the dark the dial hand illumination is a little faint so I have to get close to see it.Have had for a month and it keeps accurate time.Good value
5,Fantastic watch,I was looking for a replacement for an old Swiss Army watch and this one caught my eye at a local retailer. The price was right for an Eco-Drive so I had to check to see if I could purchase it here. The Amazon price was the best. I received the watch and couldn't be happier. It keeps good time and seems to be precise. It's better than the old Swiss. It's the nicest watch I've ever had and I'd buy it again. Thanks Amazon.
4,"Nice watch, night have to replace strap.","Nice watch at a fair price. I had to replace the strap however with a nato style strap, because the holes were spaced either to tightly or to loosely. That's the reason for the 4 stars."
