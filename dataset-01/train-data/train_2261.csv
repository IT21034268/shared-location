4,You Got Served - Take It to The Streets~~~ by Kam (B-Gal 4D),"I would recommend this DVD for fast learners and people who have had at least one year of practice in dancing. It's great but very tiring. It mainly focuses on hip-hop dancing but there is the occasional breakdance move there as well. I think people will enjoy it just like i did!Peace, Take care...Kam (B-Gal 4D)"
3,ROBERT HOFFMAN!,OMIGOSH HE's SOOO HOTT!! He played Max. I'm on a dance competition team and he taught me hip-hop at a convention. He's to DIE for. I haven't seen the instructional DVD but if he's in it -- it's awesome!
3,Movie Great - Dance Video NOT,"I first watched the You Got Served movie and loved it. I love hip hop dancing and break'n and this movie rocked. It was a high energy movie. I loved the movie so much that once the You Got Served Take It To The Streets Dance Instructional Video came out, I had to have it. The Dance Instructional Video sucked. It is not for beginners. It is very fast paced and you have to do alot of rewinding to follow along. Dance video shows some routines they do in the movie but do not go in depth or break it out by steps. I was very dissapointed and feel that a better dance instructional video could have been made!"
1,Boo,"The ""you got served"" movie was awsome i loved it so much i bought it.. So i thought i would buy the ""take it to the streets"" too but when i saw it it was the most dissapointing clip i have ever seen. it had 2 short routines from the movie, a little interview thing with breakdancing and krumping, and their ""hot & new"" routine that wasnt even that good. i am a b-boy and i do a little bit of hip-hop and believe me there are better things to waste your money on than this"
2,hmmmmm.....not too sure if you should take it to the streets,"Well.... I was really excited when I found out that 'the official learn-the-dance moves DVD from the creators of the hit film YOU GOT SERVED!' was being release. I didn't particularly enjoy the movie as the acting was terrible and there wasn't much of a storyline...but the dances moves were BANGING! But to be honest when I bought the take it to the streets DVD...I was disappointed. The moves didn't turn out to be so `hot' and me being a quick learner I thought that the routines were too rushed. Out of the whole 54 minutes, the only thing I did enjoy, was watching Omari Grandberry's freestyle (which only lasted about 3 minutes)!"
4,Want the blu-ray . . . .,"This disc set is okay,IF you can get it cheap. I actually LIKE the overly dramatic style of the AMERICA'S GAME series. The problem with this DVD set is, I saw these first on NFL Network in HD. They're beautiful, with only the vintage Steeler footage in 4:3 and everything in excellent picture quality. So, I want an affordable blu-ray set. Could be two discs. C'mon, people."
5,Steeler fan loves!,I ordered this for my dad who is a Steelers fan like i am and both of us love it! Perfect gift for Steelers fans everywhere!
4,great memories,We are die hard steeper fans. Good footage in videos. If were made this well about any other team would be enjoyed by fans of their team.
1,"Terrible range, terrible value","I wish I had been able to read the other reviews for this product prior to purchase because believe me, they're true. Unfortunately I bought it late one Sunday evening after my home phone broke suddenly. It was a total disappointment and I ended up replacing it after two miserable months. I can't imagine how it rates it's 5.8 Ghz since everything seems to cause interference. The phonebook allows you to appoint ringer selections to each entry, yet there is no correlation between what is in the phonebook and what comes up on the Caller ID. And the range... well, let's just say it might as well have a cord. Actually, it would be better with one, that way you wouldn't find yourself losing a call because you ""wandered"" 12 feet away from the base! I purchased mine for about $85 and still feel completely ripped off. I can honestly say that I NEVER had a satisfactory call on this unit. Steer clear of this one!"
1,"like the handset, hate the reception",I have the 3 handset version in an apartment and love it. I bought the 4 handset version for my home and discovered how bad the reception of this phone can be. I put the base unit in the livingroom and 2nd handset in my bedroom about 30 feet away through 1 wall-terrible reception. I can't leave the room without the phone starting to loose signal and start dropping out. I returned it after using it for 3 days. Learned after the fact that 5.8 Ghz phones have the lowest reception capability of all phone frequencies..Live and learn.
1,"Horrible range, drops out, total junk","This phone sometimes drops out even if you are standing 2 feet from the base station. We had another cordless phone that never did this in the same place, same room, same house.For what this system costs, it is an outrage. Luckily, this was borrowed from a relative. If I had bought this, it would go back to the store the very next day.It will be working okay, say, in the next room, and then spontaneously break up, drop out for 10 seconds at a time and then come back. And forget using it 2 or 3 rooms away. It is unusable at that distance.In fact, with all the chattery drop-out behavior, it's unusable, period."
1,battery does not go with sony like stated,"I purchased this battery back-up for my Sony DSC-P200 camera, it was stated that it was a Sony NP-FR1 Replacement Digital Camera Battery for Sony Cyber-shot DSC-F88, DSC-P100, DSC-P100/LJ, DSC-P100/R, DSC-P150, DSC-P200, DSC-P200/R, DSC-V3. The picture even states that it is a Lithum Ion battery. But they sent me a li-ion battery that is not compatible with my camera, now i see why it was so cheap. Do not buy this item as a replacement, it will not work..."
1,What a shame,"Unfortunately the battery lasted for only one charge cycle. But the cost was so low it's no worth returning it. I may buy another and hope it is better, or I may choose a different brand of the same battery, pay a little more, hope it lasts longer."
1,Do not buy this product,"The battery was clearly not made by Sony. It was not quite the right size so it almost got stuck in my camera. Thankfully, I got it out, but now I will never use it. I wasted my money"
1,no good,"I bought this battery as a spare battery, when i received it i placed it on charge the charger light immediately went green, but when i placed it in the camera the camera would not turn on. i then placed the battery on charge over night . same problem it would not turn on. yet when i used the original battery it works fine. so the battery is useless."
1,Dont waste your money,"I bought this battery for my Sony Cyber Shot camera. Basically it doesnt work - not compatible. I inserted the battery and charged it for 10 hours. After I removed the charger and tried to turn on the camera. The camera didnt work. It's like 1/4 of an inch thicker than the camera's original battery so taking it out of the camera is quite challenging.I tried to charge it several hours more hoping that it would work, doesnt work. Sending it bac k would have cost me more than its price so I basically threw it."
3,A nice compolation,"If you are just starting a collection, or want a greatest hits video, this is a good one, it could lead to other choices, but if you own other titles already, you are just buying the same segments re-packaged..."
3,old footage,This video has lots of old footage that is not up to the quality of newer shoots. I recomend getting a video with recent shoots.
4,I dont understand the bashing,"1st off it does not simply organize by album. you can choose genre, album, artist, or simply folder. using the room software i browse on my pc to where the music is located and right click the choose transfer. after it transfers i pick up the player and from the main menu scroll down to FOLDER, then browse my music via folder. i dont understand what is soo hard about this people, i had this thing figured out with in 5 minutes of opening the box. the display on it is brilliantly clear and ledgible, it makes me with that it had video playback as well.my only qaums with it are poor control over the user set eq's and that the internal drive is a bit noisy at times."
1,"Nice Concept, Poor Execution","The Gigabeat certainly looks like it has enough features to be a certified iPod killer. It has the sleek look, bright, sharp color screen and a sound quality that definitely outguns the iPod.What it lacks is reliability and effective technical support.One day out of the box, in the middle of my commute home, the mp3 I was playing stopped. I just had time to catch the ""Fatal Error"" message before the screen went blank. On following the documented reset procedure, I got no more than ""SYSTEM ERROR"" displayed on the screen. There is apparently only 1 ""specialist"" at the support center with any kind of knowledge at all of the product, and he was out for several days. I am still awaiting a callback that I doubt will come.So....think twice before you slap down your hard earned money on this expensive toy, and whatever you do, DON'T buy one on EBAY!!!! Stick to an electonics store that you have return privileges at if this is something you must have."
2,will take some extra work,I got this for a 2000 blazer. Amazon said it would fit my vehicle and it did but I had to do a lot of modding to get it to fit. Whatever vehicle you get it for have patience and some tools ready.
5,Install kit that will work.,"I bought this kit because I needed something that would let me put a half din parametric eq/line driver above my head unit. More than one car.audio shop said there wasn't such an animal. Well, this kit will work with some modifications. I had to just basically cut out everything leaving only the outer frame. With everything cut out you can fit a single din deck with a half din eq right on top of it. Looks great. Just be ready to do some cutting and maybe a little glue and tape here and there. This kit is pretty much your only option if you want to put an eq in your Blazer dash with your deck. Just be careful and creative and it will look like a pro installed your stuff."
5,Fantastic handling,"As good as you can get an overweight steel barge to handle.Seriously though, I slapped them on my 86 K5 blazer and the handling change was amazing. Absolutely stunning difference and you owe it to yourself to try a set. Most likely your shocks are blown already so anything is better than nothing, but these are way better than anything else you are gonna get."
4,classic ent,"ent is the greatest crust band, this cd is a must have. oh yeah, and filthkick is pretty decent too"
4,"Does the job, although it's quite big","We roast meat a couple of times a week, and it's usually just for the two of us, as our six-month old daughter isn't quite up to roast lamb just yet. So the juice from our joint barely comes up to a centimetre from the bottom of this pot.This is not a problem for separation, as the juices stay at the bottom when you tilt the separator, and the fat comes off the top. So you can get rid of most of the fat, and this really improves the gravy. So it works well, but a smaller version would have been even more useful for a small family like mine. I would definitely recommend this if you do a big roast, and want to separate out the juices."
1,Plastic,One should not have any hot liquid in plastic. It is not good for you health. Why not use glass
1,Wrong Picture,"I expected a assortment of blue, red, and black pens. It was actually a combination pink, light blue, and purple. Very very dissatisfied; buyers beware."
3,"They write nicely, but are a little messy",I like the smooth way these pens write. But I have noticed that I get ink on my hands when using them.
1,"Review of Woody Woodpecker Collector's Edition, Vol. 1","It's only 30 minutes. There are only 4 cartoons--'Woody Woodpecker (Cracked Nut)'--this is the first cartoon starring Woody. The rest are as follows--'Banquet Busters', 'Born to Peck' and 'The Redwood Sap' and the only one of these worth bothering with is the first one!! Just to let you know, there are only 4 cartoons in Vol. 2 as well although 3 of the 4 cartoons are worth the price."
3,Bleach Movie 2: The DiamondDust Rebellion,The movie is good but the special feature's are just subbed from the japanese edition and no commentary track like with the first movie and behind the scene's of the dubbed actors
5,Awesome and Touching,"This is the story of Captian Toshiro Hitsugaya of squad 10. Hitsugaya leaves his post as captain to find his old friend Kusaka, who was supposed to be dead. We learn of Hitsugaya's past as a student in the academy and we witnees the pain and sufferings Hitsugaya has been dealing with since then. This movie is so touching I cried the first time I saw it. Ichigo makes Hitsugaya realize that it brings more pain to others around him, if he does not share his burden. I recommend this movie and now I'm waiting for the third movie to complete my collection so far."
5,will not,I will not regret buying this movie as it brought alot of hilarious questions to end as well as the possiblity to have bleach renewed in my book.
5,Loved it,"I love bleach and seen all the movies that they made. Found this cheap and ordered it right away. Came fast, in new condition. Was amazing!!"
4,"Same Bleach Fun, Same Bleach Station","This is a fun movie, if you can get past the cheese ball factor. But then again the show is like that too. All the pre-requisits are there: crazy mysterious bad guy, crazy overblown fights and cheese ball dialogue. But that is what makes it fun I think. If you like the show, you'll probably like the movie."
5,Bleach Movie 2: Great movie!,Item came in good condition and in 6 days. There were no problems for this item that's good. Very happy 5 out of 5. The movie has a good story to tell. What I like about this movie is that everybody plays a part in it and joins the fight. If you are a BLEACH fan I highly recommend this movie.
1,NOT POLARIZED!!,"This is supposed to come with a C7 polarized( one circle, one square ) end. It does not! At first I thought they had sent me the wrong one, but the box even declares that it is polarized! I'm doubting the ""Research"" in Acoustic Research if they don't even know what the end of thier cord is supposed to be called."
3,Interesting,"I saw this book and have been wanting it for a long time. I even saw it locally and looked through it. I liked what was in it. For me, the information was not usful due to I have other books with with similar information. But I still think this is a good book. I was misled by the way it was described here on Amazon, I thought it was a acutal kit. I was sadly disappointed when i got it for Christmas and it wasn't. But I do recommend this for others that are in need of help."
2,I expected more.,"Mr. Neal's first book on incense was an informative, in depth study of the fine art of making and burning incense. Unfortunately this book fails to live up to the success of the first book.This book is shallow and uninspiring. Of course there is basic info concerning cauldrons, bells, and wands. . .ect however, one of the greatest flaws of this book is the fact that magick mirrors are not covered at all. How can anyone write about magickal tools and not discuss this topic?"
5,Keep the Send-Away Girl,"The first time you read these short stories, you may find yourself missing subway stops or receiving curious glances from fellow commuters as you try to suppress your smiles and outright laughter. On a second reading - and these stories will repay multiple readings - you become aware of the craftsmanship of Sutton's writing. Sutton is not just an excellent stylist , but a stylist whose prose serves her message. The hard clarity of her writing is the perfect vehicle for the tough and unsentimental tone of these stories. Whether in the jaundiced observations of a divinity school employee sent to pump a donation out of a dying woman (""The Rest of Esther""), or the evocation of an emotionally fraught romantic triangle (""Risk Merchants""), Sutton's blend of spare eloquence and ""tough guy"" pose recalls Martin Amis more than any contemporary American woman."
2,"Blonde, bland, and boring","Victoria Silvstedt makes phony love to prince charming who always remembers to buy condoms at the general store, just the material spice and romance is made of. Fell asleep before it was over. She's got a big pair, but she's one dumb blonde!"
2,"Great show, but Region 1 be warned...","Great show, but these ""region free"" blu-rays will only give US/Region 1 viewers access to the programme itself...not the extras! So do not buy if you are a fan of extras!"
2,Can't relate to the British version of the series,"I bought both of the British series DVD's because I loved the American series. I give the American series a 5* rating. The storyline, the interaction between the characters, the details in the scenes, were all great. And I loved the American nostalgia. I just couldn't relate to the British version, probably because I didn't grow up there. The British version (original one) is probably just as good for them as the American version is for me.Paid $47.99 for Series 1, $42.99 for Series 2, & shipping was free. Purchased on 02-18-2010 directly from Amazon."
5,"Series 2, just as good as series 1 (International Blu-Ray)","If you are purchasing this product, you probably already know what LIfe on Mars is, and loved the show. Since it has not been released in the USA, this is one of the few ways to get a copy. The video and audio quality are great (IT's nice to see Sam and Gene on my new big tv, and not have the commerical interruptions). I highly recommend it, but be warned, it is not a copy made for the USA. (Some Blu-Ray players may have difficulty playing it, but none that I have found yet. I have 3 Sony (BDP-s330, BDPS-350, PS-3) as well as two different drives in PC's. I highly recommended this for anyone needing their Sam and Gene fix."
3,Is There Really BluRay on Mars?,"I was delighted to see that Season Two of this series was available in BluRay format. Although I felt some caution at seeing the accompanying statement, ""The manufacturer has discontinued this product"", I took a chance, since none of the reviews said ""it won't play on your machine"". I discovered that my Sony BDP S350 player does play the episodes; but it hums quite audibly when loading and reading each new segment of the disc. The really disappointing discovery was that none of the special features will play. Their titles appear on the screen, but when they are selected, the screen refreshes to the main menu. The issue is the same for the special features on both discs. I'm really curious to see the ""making of"" bits, so I have requested the DVD version from my local library. I don't feel like buying the season over again in DVD format.Also, I know it's heretical, but my viewers think the DVD version I own of Season One looks and sounds just as good as this one."
5,best british show ever,"I ran across this show on the BBCA and I was hooked, it introduced me to Johm Simm and Philip Glenister who are wounderful actors. the sify aspect of the show is great and I couldn't wait for the series to be out on DVD. Now I can watch when ever I want. You cant go wrong if your a fan of British tv"
4,I think this could be a good movie if you can get past the language.,"I tried to watch this movie and got about 10 minutes in until I could not stand the language. The story is very intriguing and exciting and I thought I could blank out the ""F"" word but it is in almost every other sentence. I finally screamed at it and said no more of this trash talk.I'd love to watch an edited version and find out what happens. I will never understand why movie producers feel the need to make language so bad. If it was occ use I could have blocked it out but it is constant. So if language bothers you this is not a movie for you.Update 7-2010 I may watch it again. I made it through Precious and it was the F word all the time and I was able to understand it was the context she lived it. I do want to know what happens as it starts off really good."
3,"Have a Stolly, with a twist","Definitely not top-shelf HBO. A tense and very serious storyline is minimized with comic relief (some of it pretty funny) and Russian gangsters that are as dumb as a fence post. Two Russian hoods have stolen a blonde, long-haired thoroughbred dog for the purpose of extortion. Imagine this dog placidly sprawled out over a fat, dumb-looking thug. And with a thick Russian accent he says: ""I have nevva seen a doogg like dis, it is like a woman,.......... I have named her Sheba"". A curious mix of heavy melodrama and comedy. But if you ever wanted to see someone snort plutonium, this is your movie."
5,Two Desperate Men...,"In PU-239, Paddy Considine (DEAD MAN'S SHOES) plays Timofey, a worker in a Russian nuclear power plant who gets exposed to 10x the lethal dose of radiation. With scant days to live, he steals some plutonium, leaves his wife (Radha Mitchell from PITCH BLACK, ROGUE, SILENT HILL, THE CRAZIES, and THE VISITORS) and son, and sets out for Moscow, where he hopes to sell his lethal cargo to the mob. While mostly tragic, this movie also delves into the darkly hilarious when the Russian gangsters are involved. Their psychopathy is evenly matched by their utter idiocy! The ending is especially well-done, w/ both a heart-felt finale for mother and son, and an hysterically (jet black) fitting finish for the mobsters! Highly recommended..."
3,"Good, lighthearted, Christian romance.","I expected a little more romance, but overall a good book. I was entertained and didn't put it down all night until I had read every page. It was a short read, I would recommend it to anyone in need of a lighthearted suspense/romance. Although Christianity is prevalent throughout the novel I would have liked Grace to have been bolder expressing her faith to Peter. But over all good book. I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
4,Loved it!!,If you love this writer -- then this is the book for you!! She has added in enough detail to bring your mind directly to where she is. and has put together a story that is totally timeless!! :) Enjoy!!
3,Next two books are better,"This was the first book in the Yukon Quest series. I was somewhat dissapointed with this book. It wasn't fast paced enough for me. However, I did finish the book and went on to read the second and third book of the series and would highly recommend them! Like I said, the first book is a little difficult to get through but it is a must read in order to fully understand the other two book of the series."
2,I Couldn't Get Into It,"The first Tracie Peterson books I read were the Heirs of Montana series. I devoured them and was left hungry for more! I decided to read another book by Tracie and chose Treasures of the North. I could not get into this book. The plot was too predictable, and at times I was tempted to just stop reading and move on to another.Not only was the plot predictable, but the character development was just not there - not like it is in the Heirs of Montana series.I have no desire to finish the series. I am, however, going to continue reading Tracie's books - just not the Yukon Quest series."
4,Terrific Alaskan Romance,Got this book for my birthday and have never read any books by this author. I was captivated at once and found the book delightful. I was disappointed at first at the ending because it left so many situations hanging until I found out that its the first in a new series. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to any romance novel lover.
3,Contamination Possible,"The 5 lbs of dried papaya chunks arrived in a blue plastic bag tied with a thin plastic rope. This blue plastic bag was in a box filled with packing peanuts. There was no inner liner to protect the food from the blue plastic bag and packing peanuts. This probably would have been more sanitary if the food was packaged in a vacuum sealed bag or even a zip lock sealed bag. The papaya tasted okay, but the potential for contamination exists with this packaging configuration. I do not think that I will order this again."
2,"Worth a view, but not a purchase","55 minutes, 12 scenes, and only the 1st & last kept my attention. Nikki Ziering (one of The Price Is Right beauties) smokes on the cover & in the 1st scene, host Tylyn John is eye-catching in the last.The rest is lightweight, bubblegum filler that even the mediocre, past-their-prime models (certainly not Playboy's best) seem to have a hard time going through. I was disappointed with the quality of the models (maybe this is to appeal to ""biker types"")...and while Harley fans might find this entertaining, I'm confident that it is probably one of Playboy's lamest releases."
5,Superbly written history with a fictional overlay,"Hawaii in 1895 has been recently taken over by whites with the help of a U.S. gunship and a contingent of marines. Eve Hanson, a recent immigrant from Norway, is caught up in the accompanying rebellion of the native Hawaiians against their oppressors, chiefly as the result of her discovering the body of a murdered man. The story, itself, is less important than the graphically described Honolulu of that turbulent period--the prostitutes, the drunken sailors, the leper catchers, the opium dens, the tambourine shaking evangelicals and the arrogant Americans who stole Hawaii from its inhabitants."

4,"Decisions, Decisions.....","As a large, gray, wand wielding rabbit, complete with upturned magician's hat, sits facing a young boy and girl, he asks...""Which would you rather be? A stick or a stone?"" And so the game begins. Would you rather be an elbow or a knee, mouse or elephant, rain or snow, snake or crocodile, alone or together? Some of the answers seem to be obvious, as we see a balding, eyeglass wearing, paper reading grown-up come out of the hat, compared to a skateboard riding kid. But it's clear from the start that there are no right or wrong answers. Just thoughtful, clever fun. William Steig's minimal text, floating in dialogue bubbles, sets the stage. But it's Harry Bliss' bold, bright, and expressive artwork that steals the show with its humorous detail. Perfect for preschoolers, Which Would You Rather Be? is a simple and entertaining picture book that will get those creative juices flowing. This is just the beginning; the game is sure to continue long after the book is closed."
4,instant hit... nice idea,"my twins liked this book straight away. at 2 and a half they picked up on the theme and started making up ""which would you rather be"" questions of their own. I'd recommend this book. It's a good imagination stimulant."
5,Live the Dream - The Texas Longhorns' Magical March to the 2005 National Championship,I bought this for my 12 year old Grandson upon his request. He LOVES the DVD! His mother says he watches it all the time.
2,Video,This video is not that good at all. Not what I expected. The person talking was the most boring part of the video.
1,Great Form - Poor Function,"As it sometimes happens in design, a really beautiful piece doesn't work as well as it looks. Such is the case with this cocktail shaker. It's beautiful in form but weak in function. The style is great but it is messy to use. At least one ounce of a drink will go up into the cap while shaking. If it does not settle back into the container, it runs down the sides and all over your hands, counter, floor etc. when you take the cap off. Pouring from the shaker is equally as messy due to the bad arrangement of the holes in the strainer. I was really disappointed and sent mine back."
2,Definately not impressed.,"This shaker is not of the quality I expected. It is very thin metal and neither top fits correctly. Due to the poor fit of the smaller of the two tops, it is sometimes necessary to hold it on while shaking. I find this setup clumsy.The large top fits a bit too tight and I could hardly even get it off. All in all I would not recommend this shaker. Even if your just concerned with having something that looks good on the bar. The shape is very sleek and cool but I feel that the metal causes it to simply look cheap."
1,Failed within 2 weeks,"I don't know if it had not been stored correctly or whether it was fraudullent, but it failed very shortly after having been installed."
2,nothing like picture,"I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS RING-IT LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL ONLINE-BUT IN PERSON IS A FLIMSY-CZ-THAT LOOKS LIKE A VENDING MACHINE RING,IT IS DECEIVING.IF YOU WANT A NICE BAND-DON'T BUY THIS ONE."
2,not as good as it looks,I gotthis ring but I do not like it because it snags on everything like clothing and your skin. I do not suggest anyone to buythis ring.
4,Good movie to watch with your girl,"I've only seen this movie on VHS but I can't imagine why it will differ, besides being higher quality video and audio. This is one of those good (as far as the genre is) erotic movie with softcore sex and some romance to it. This is the perfect Friday night with wine movie to watch with your girl. If you buy this, you HAVE to buy the first movie ""I Like to Play Games"" which i would give 5 out of 5 stars."
5,Provocative and exciting,"Maria Ford is gorgeous and the story line is sensual, provocative and sexually stimulating without a hardcore presentation."
5,"Good movie, good script, ok acting","I just watched this movie on Cinemax this morning and it was pretty good. Yes there is strong sexual content but the movie is quite good. Maria Ford stars in this erotic tale, she puts on a good performance, though there are some corny lines. If you are buying this movie for oscar winning acting you will not find this but if you are looking for a movie with lots of nudity then this is for you. Be sure to get the unrated version becuase the R rated version is just dumb."
4,"Adorable bed, great value however...",This toddler bed is absolutely adoable- looks so cute in the room. However...(1) there is a sticker on the headboard that is impossible to get off- I read a review about it and thought it was a silly rant- however it took me a good half hour to get it completely off(2) if you have an active sleeper- one that tends to tumble around the crib- the transition to this bed could be difficult- or little one is three weeks into the bed -and we have it against one wall and cushions on the other side and is still falling out at least once a night.
2,Disappointed,"This is a cute bed but, I am disappointed with the way it arrived at my home. When I opened this box there was only 2 slivers of foam within the entire box. Needless to say the headboard had 3 crushed corners. My daughter was so excited to get a new bed that I felt it wasn't worth the extra effort to exchange because I would probably end up with the same ragged corners because the packing is so poor. I am desperately trying to ignore the ugly cracks on the headboard. If possible do not order online because the packing of this bed is awful, and I totally regret buying this.If the box and padding had been sturdy enough I am sure I would be recommending this bed instead of cautioning against it."
3,Warning label?,"The manufacturer attached an 8""x4"" warning label right on the decorative side of headboard. And it wasn't one that peeled off. It was one that when you started to peel it off, parts of the label and adhesive stuck to the wood. If you scrap too hard, the paint chips off with it. I even tried scrubbing it with a wet, soapy washcloth with little success. I just put that part of the bed up against the wall so you can't see the label (that is still on there). Seriously, why would they do that???"
4,Child's bed pretty,"This is a very pretty bed and easy to assemble. I put it together myself and I am an older woman. You'll need a mattress (we got one for $50 and it was fine).My daughter said that her little one keeps bumping into the side ""wall"" so it might be better not to have a side wall at all but the trade off is prettier piece of furniture."
3,"Great bed, but packaging leaves desire","The bed is great, however, it did come damaged. When I pay this much for something, I expect it to atleast not be damaged. The headboard was damaged but on the backside, so I can live with it, but I definately think that it should be packaged better. I should have listened to the other reviews. Unfortunately my daughter is in love with it and it would destroy her if we return it now..."
1,Bad design for restless sleeper,"I bought this bed 2 years ago because I liked the design. I now regret it. My daughter is a restless sleeper, and as she flops around during the night, I often hear a klunk as she hits the low sides of the bed. It's a wonder she hasn't really injured herself. I have padding on the sides and at the foot of the bed. If I could possibly afford a new one with better design, this one would get tossed."
3,Think of it as a sequel to the howling series.,"While I.was watching this movie I got the feeling I was watching another movie in the howling series instead of a ""reboot"" as they call it. If you watch it from that point of view its not to bad of a movie, BUT it definitely could have been done alot better. When lord when are we going to get a awesome werewolf movie? I guess for now we will have to settle for underworld, though I did think the wolfman remake was.a hell of a movie. I really enjoyed the transformations in that movie!"
1,"If you like Twilight, you'll like this.",90% of this movie was about two teenagers falling in love. They don't even show any werewolves for the first hour. And thereis little to no gore. Most of the other Howling films were good/cheesy horror flicks but this was just a retarded love story made by some douche who was trying to make money off the Twilight fan base.
2,DvD cover,only thing good about this movie is a good pitchure on the cover this is not a very good movie they could have done lot better
2,Good soundtrack....,"And some good voiceover work from the main actor, a young man in high school. The rest of it is a long, dull slog that could have been better had the script actually been coherent."
2,Tofel,"i bought all kaplan line for GRE and TOEFL , they R VERY SUPERFICIAL .THEY r good for a very basic issues , to introduce subject but not study it in detailed."
4,Great resource for students who need to up their vocabulary,I would definitely recommend this book for high-intermediate students who plan to take the TOEFL. It's well laid out and gives clear definitions. Ultimately it depends on the motivation of the student to determine the efficacy of the results from the book. It's cheaply priced and no fluff.
1,Very basic words...,"If you have completed your schooling from a decent school, then you dont need this book.Trust me.. keep reading newspaper and novels and that would help you more than anything.. and zillion times more than this book. It sux man."
3,Could be better,"Althought this grater has more style than most kitchen gadgets, it does not perform as well. It will grate anything you like, but it will take longer and your hands will hurt more. I find the classic, handle on top, four sided graters much easier and faster to use. Bottom line: for light grating, if you need some cheese grated once in a while it will function beautifuly, but for heavy duty every day use I do not recommend this item."
2,Great Looking but Hard to Clean,"I thought this grater looked great out on the counter and it does shred ok. The problem is cleaning it. Cheese and the like tend to get stuck up at the top which makes it very difficult to clean. Also, the little plastic feet started to come off so it wasn't worth it to even keep it anymore and we just pitched it."
1,Russian Roulette,These weight loss supplements are really dangerous. Read the science behind these products - not their sales pitch.
2,Didn't work for me,"Didn't work for me at all, and gave me constipation while taking it. I don't recommend it."
2,Expired,I would have liked my purchase had it not been for the EXPIRED use by date.Shocked that they have no quality control to catch such an error. I will not purchase from them again. Buyer BEWARE: Expire dates are there for a reason!!
2,never would i recommend this weight loss pill,this pill is very addicting and dangerous i would never recommend it my brother and i were both hospitalized because of it.
1,Not good at all,"I just started taking this product last week and now I'm having problems with cramps in my legs, my whole body is jittering, and I can't sleep. The whole thing with feeling energy in 45 minutes is true but I rather feel completely drained than to feel the way I do now. All in all this is not a good product to take unless your doctor say's ""go for it""."
4,Energy by Stacker 2,"Here is a must product that I have used in the past, to trim off some weight, around my waist and get a great energy boost at the same time. Taken as directed I eat less and feel energy all through the am. I take the second pill after lunch for energy to get me through the pm hours. If you feel tired and low energy this is the product for you."
1,Read Those Labels!!,"I was taken by the ""Now Ephedrine Free"" label. I took as per label directions,(1 capsule after meals,3 times a day)taking the last around 6pm. I could not sleep at all that night. I looked at the smaller print on the back and this containd 200mg of caffiene per pill! I am not hypersensitive to caffeine (thank goodness) but nobody needs this amount of a stimulant in their system.(Mountain Dew,by comparison,has 45 mg per 12 oz serving).I have since been using a tried and true method for weight loss..eat less,do more!"
1,Not worth the risk,Read your labels! You should be afraid to take this stuff. Anything that warns of heart problems or strokes is not worth it!
1,Didn't due nothing to me,I tried the Stacker 2 Fat Burner Capsules for several months and really didn't due nothing to me. I do not see any differnce. I am not a big person I'm only 5'1 and I weight 120 lbs I was trying to use them more for Energy and to burn some of my stomach fat but It really didn't due nothing..
5,Received in a timely fashion,"Had to switch to energy pills because Sobe stopped making the only energy drink that I liked, and I HATE coffee. Stackers are great! Not as good as when they had ephedrine in them, but still works great! Both as a hunger suppressor as well as a boost in energy. I don't get that nauseating feeling that ""5hr energy"" gives you by making you overdose on B12 vitamins. Have yet to have a problem with Amazon."
4,Second CD is Brilliant,"I wasn't that impressed with the first cd, I think it was a bit repetitive in terms of themes and music and lacked the ovarall quality of Risin Outlaw. It was good but didnt blow me away. However the second CD was brilliant in terms of creativity, this could have been a release in itself and definitly almost creates a new type of genre. Hank is going places with this, somewhere where no other CW artist has gone. I hope he keeps going in that direction."
4,DONT BE SCARED,"SERIOUSLY, QUIT PUTTING DOWN THIS ALBUM FOR DRUG REFRENCES.IF YOU LIKE HANK III THEN YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT. IF YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT DRUG REFERENCES GO JOIN THE PMRC. WE ALL KNOW WHO HANK III IS, WE KNOW HE IS ABOUT MUSIC, HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK. HE JAMS IN COUNTRY AND HEAVY METAL. AND REALLY ALL YOU PEOPLE REFRENCING WAYNE HANCOCK GET REAL, ALL YOU SHOULD BE DOING IS THANKING HANK FOR INTRODUCING YOU TO WAYNE,I AGREE THAT WAYNE IS A GREAT SONG WRITER BUT GET REAL HALF OF YOU POSERS WOULD'T KNOW WHO HE WAS WITH OUT H3. HEY HANK KEEP DOING WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT, WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE YOU IN THE WORLD....OUTLAW COUNTRY NEEDS A HERO, YOU ARE IT."
5,best country artist out there,"Hank 111 outdid himself on this one.real edgy ,talented outlaw music.this guy has talent.three times is a charm!dont miss out."
5,Transfarmageddon,"With Disc 2 of this set, the continuum of Modern Music is bridged between Mountain Music and the World Musics of Stockhausen and all other technological innovators. This is a perfect blueprint for the Blend Times of the ReNew Millennium. Highly recommended."
4,Great album,"""Straight to Hell"" is the best country album to come out since Ween's ""12 Golden Country Greats"". This is what country music should sound like."
1,pass on this...look for the original version!!!,"This is Curb records pathetic attempt to get more $$ from one of the artists who have left their label. It is a stripped down version of what is an otherwise INCREDIBLE album. It was released several years ago to rave reviews, and has been one of Hank III's strongest albums to date. It's rowdy, it's raw, and it is most definitely IN YOUR FACE!! If you don't get easily offended, and would like to hear the ORIGINAL version of this album, please purchase the UNEDITED VERSION. And check out hank3.com for all of his new music that was released on his OWN label. I am not trying to slam Amazon. They have nothing to do with the release of this ""sugar coated"" version of Straight to Hell. 5 stars for Hank 3...1 star for this ploy from Curb Records to get MORE $$ from someone with whom they had a shaky business relationship. Shame on you, Curb records...SHAME ON YOU!!!"
3,I Like Hank III,"I really enjoy the music of Hank III. I own almost all of III's releases and each has some strong tracks on them. This one has some, too. I dig Satan is Real/Straight to Hell, Crazed Country Rebel,and Dick In Dixie, but that's about it. That 42 minute whatever on disc2 is a waste of space. For any disc to deserve 5 stars more than half of the songs should be good. Hank III has still not reached this yet..."
2,Couple of good songs,I am into hard country. Not sure what you would call this type of country. Couple of good songs but most I did not like.
5,Real Country,He's one of the few artist playing actual country music these days. He always knows how to inject energy into the performances. Go see Hank Williams III live!
4,Mighty Fine Record,"After all these years of waiting, we finally get the new country release from Hank III. If you've seen him on tour over the last 3 years or so, you've probably heard nearly all of these tunes in concert. I'm amazed at the fantastic production of these recordings -- great depth and clarity preserving the energy of the songs. Highlights for me include ""Low Down"" and ""Crazed Country Rebel"". This is one heck of a good time disc with most of the tunes composed as wry reflections on the good and bad sides of partying too hard. Who hasn't been there, eh? My only complaint is that Disc 1 is too short. It has enough space left over to be twice the length. Disc 2 is cool and has some great moments of Hank singing with nothing but his guitar for backup -- but Disc 1 is the main event.Can't wait to see them live next week!"
5,Real country,"I've never written an amazon review before but was inspired by this album. Real country music on disk I followed by an incredible 42 minute track on disk II consisting of a variety of sounds (trains, rain etc) interspersed with little gems of old time country songs. Ubelievably good."
3,I want the Versailles garden plan,"I'm interested in versailles garden, so I want some special information about it's geometry. I'm the student of Architecture."
3,Not for the beginner,"If you've been a vegetarian or vegan for a while this is probably a good resource. For a beginner, however, it's just too much and the recipes are too involved. Also, many of the recipes require the use of other recipes in the book, and we simply don't have three hours to prepare a meal every night.My recommendation would be to check it out at a local bookstore (like Barnes & Noble) before you buy it. Had I done this, I wouldn't have bought it."
4,"Before I Kill You, Mister Bond...","This game was previously known as Before I Kill You, Mister Bond. The movie people got hold of their lawyers and Cheapass Games renamed it. The game is still a lot of fun though.Try to resist the temptation to stroke a fluffy white cat while you attempt to prevent spies from destroying your lair. When you have the hapless agents at your mercy, you have to choose whether to kill them immediately, or play Taunt cards. Taunting a spy will earn you tons of extra points, but you run the risk of other players might foil your Taunt and allow the spy to escape, ruining your plans for world domination (again).Try to find fellow players with a good sense of humour, as you'll all get much more from the game if you play it less than seriously. James Bond 007 movie fans and people who enjoy amusing adult card games will love it."
3,Not good enough,"In my opinion this dvd does not give you that hard to describe "" I'm impressed feeling"" ...it just shows quick shots (too quick) of very beautiful woman playing around very delicately. Not sexy enough for my taste, the takes are too fast, you just do not have a chance to appreciate the girls'beauty... rent it, do not buy it."
4,"Great design, stupid instructions","If they give you screws to mount directly into a stud but don't provide anchors, wouldnt you think the spread of the holes would allow you to drive the screws directly into a stud? Unfortunately the screw spread is larger than than the width of a standard stud therefore I had to go hunting for another screw/anchor for the right side. Now the screws don't match.............c'mon guys.The design and weighting of the hook is excellent. Being able to put it down when you are not hanging anything is a plus."
5,Wall Mounted Laundry Valet,I am pleased with with the Laundry Valet. I have a small laundry room with stacked washer and dryer and I don't really have a lot of spaces to hang my clothes. When I don't use it it just fold back. Look neat and clean.
2,Not the worst book I've read...,"I must admit, this book is outside my preferred genre. I am not a fan of Patterson-Baldacci-Grisham. I prefer historical fiction (Jeff Shaara) or fantasy (George R.R. Martin). This book left me very unsatisfied. The protagonist is flawed to the point of being unlikeable. The ending felt like a weak cop-out. I chose this book to read because I was travelling and needed a ""thin"" book that was easy to carry. Reading Harry Potter with my 8 year old was more rewarding than 'The Monsters of Gramercy Park'."
5,Love it,As soon as I was not taking it for a week (also take Suma and Pau d'arco with it) I came down with a virus for the first time in 7 years. These three items taken together kind of make one of those super juices everyone is talking about for a fraction of the cost.
5,Rita Mae Brown Book,Excellent stories for those who love cats and corgis. It was nice to read multiple books in one. Less to lug around. Would read again.
1,Don't buy this book,"The ""About the Author"" section explains that Dave's cat, Taffy, writes his code. He should have let the cat write the book as well. The book ventures beyond beginner level often and quickly. The code is often broken up into seperate sections, usually in a logical order, too often not. There are also too many obvious errors in the code examples, even rediculous things like opening one header size and closing with a different one. If you are going to have people pay for a product, take the time to check it. Over all, the book does a good job at explaining most concepts of ASP but is confusing when trying to learn the specifics, which is rather important in writing code."
1,Inconsistent,"Well this book starts of great. The first 3 chapters are very nice and straight forward to follow. After that though, the book jumps around ALOT, and is very hard to follow. Lots of liitle details are left out in order to save pages. The examples in the book are downloadable off the Internet don't always work. This book needs to be written clearer and more detailed. I was very very frustrated with the book and strongly not recommend the book to other readers."
1,Not for first-time programmers,"Though this book bills itself as providing ""essential skills for first-time programmers,"" a look at Module 2 should convince you otherwise. As the author explains, ASP is a technology and not a programming language, so to use active server pages you'll have to become familiar with a scripting language such as VBScript or JScript. But Module 2 will stop you dead in your beginner's tracks, when under the heading ""VBScript Basics,"" the author declares in the third paragraph, ""Variables can be declared anywhere within code, simply by using the Dim statement. However, it is wise to use the Option Explicit statement (<% Option Explicit Dim var1, var 2 %>) at the beginning of your code, because it forbids the use of variable names that have not been explicitly dimensioned."" Good luck."
4,"Good book for a ""Beginner"".","I am a newbie but not an ""idiot"" or ""dummy"". I have a some knowledge on HTML and have used WYSIWYG tools like FrontPage and Dreamweaver. Recently, I started becoming more interested in creating Active Server Pages and I found this book very useful for an ASP ""beginner"" like me. I found Module 2 especially helpful with the discussion on the basics of ASP and ""proper coding techniques"". I'm in the middle of the book(Module 7) right now and find the explanations on Ad Rotators just what I needed for one of my projects. Overall, a really useful book so far."
2,"Starts great, quickly becomes confusing",My first impressions of this book were favorable. I quickly changed my mind. I found that the book said that it was for a beginner but did not deliver. I found that I needed to research much of the VB script and other aspects of the book in order to understand it. I got tired of it and returned the book.
4,For those who want to get to the point,"I find this book to be great help for someone who has programmed (like me) in another language who needs a quick start. I don't recommend this book for those that need hand holding, a ""newbie"" to programming, or want to finish the book in a day. I like the author's style of writing and enjoy the ""Ask the Expert"" and ""Mastery Check"" sections. Often times I refer to this book for pointers."
3,"Good, but...","I have found this book a useful complement to the Sybex IIS/VB webclasses book--this is the best description of how to use the Application object and global.asa that I have seen so far. However, the author of the Osborne book did a sloppy job of laying out the sample projects in this book--for example, frequently he doesn't even tell you what to name the files. If it weren't for this I would give the book four or five stars."
1,Never received!!! Horrible company,"I never received this product and the company never informed me that there was a problem. After several weeks and several emails and phone calls I discovered that the company was out of stock. This company is NOT a recognized dealer for this product and can not get more stock. I spoke to the manufacturer and they advised me they've had trouble with this company selling their product without an agreement. I would never by from this company or Amazon again. Horrible. I ordered three products and have the stroller kit and additional bike attachment, but no trailer. Nearly $100 wasted. Beware of buying from Amazon and associated companies."
5,Canine Commuter,"Recently got a dog. I ride my bike about 3 miles to work every day and I wanted to bring the doggie along. This trailer arrived quickly, was very easy to put together and feels much more stable than I expected when riding. Even though my dog is small enough to fit into a basket (8-10lbs). The trailer feels like a safer option.I accustomed my dog to it over the course of a weekend with the use of a lot of treats. He was a little whiny the first few days of regular commuting. Now he is fine and jumps in on his own.Only complaints are that the included floor cushion is a little thin and moves out of place immediately, and it would be nice to be able to attach a flag. I am going to have to figure out my own flag hack for better visibility.I get a lot of inquiries from interested dogowners."
2,Cheap wheels/tires,"This trailer has the cheapest tires imaginable. ( My first impression of the pneumatic tires is that they looked and felt cheap.) We took our sheltie on two rides, each about 30 miles long.Toward the end of the second ride, a tire popped. Upon examination, I found that the tread rubber was completely worn through, with threads showing everywhere on both tires! I am contacting the seller for restitution. The cloth part of the trailer is reasonably constructed. Our dog whined for 3 miles, then settled down."
1,No real music from DM???,I was so excited to see this and then in little letters it states no real music by the band????? LAME don't waste your $$$PS no stars is what I should have rated it....
2,Konfidential,"My biggest beef is that this video has dubbed the music from Alive III. The video performances are not necessarily the ones that were recorded for the album.IMO, the only thing that saves this video are the clips from '75, '76, & '77."
4,To Know Some More About Kiss,"Both videos are based on the Revenge (1992) era, paying some tribute to the past. Konfidential is much like Alive III interpolated with some '70s footage and X-Treme Close Up is a testimonial given by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons about Kiss history.The package has a good cost X benefit relation. Highly recommendable."
5,Worth the Money for sure!!,"I thought this was a great DVD - but as with all things KISS, it's just never enough! It could be 8 hours and it wouldn't be enough. I would recommend this DVD to all KISS fans to see what these guys are all about. Not really for the kids, though, unless you watch it first and FFwd through the rough spots. But then, KISS was never supposed to be a g-rated band."
3,The Silurians are back,"Gary Russell sets himself some unenviable tasks with this novel: to clear up some continuity problems from the fifth Doctor story 'Warriors of the Deep'; to depict Liz Shaw's departure from UNIT, and to detail the breakdown of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart's first marriage. All this and to pit the Doctor against the Silurians once more.The disappearance of a young boy ties in with a policewoman making cave paintings - a sign that an encounter with the Silurians have raised deeply-buried racial memories. The Doctor finds his closest allies distracted by personal matters, and must investigate largely on his own.Mr. Russell tries to fit too much into the one book. While much of it is fairly well handled, it results in a disjointed read. The continuity holes in 'Warriors of the Deep' aren't that important that a book such as this needed to be written to fix them.Probably Liz Shaw and her reasons for leaving UNIT are the best part of the book."
4,Pretty good for the price,"I like these pens, but they don't write quite as fine as the Precise V5. However, they are significantly cheaper, so they are probably the better deal."
1,I cannot believe my eyes!,"I really cannot believe my eyes. The back cover says: ""Coverage includes: Mastering the Resource Reservation Protocol"" and ""QOS in Wide Area Networks includes detailed coverage of ... MPLS"". RSVP is barely mentioned in the book. It is simply named on page 10, 68 and it is ""defined"" in 54 lines in an appendix (most text is introductory). As for MPLS it is not even in the analitic index and I was not able to find reference to it elsewhere. I think law should forbid these behaviours. I am surprised Prentice Hall (which I always knew as a very serious publisher) did this."
5,Differentiated quality of service,"This book provides a deep insight into providing the differentiated services in the traditional model of Internet Protocol. It also provides a wide perspective on the quality of service,congestion and control techniques. It impels us into providing Differentiated services the want inspite of overprovisioning of bandwidth. The Book lacks one element to include the multi protocol label switching technology which is in the developmental phase and is l is likely to be implemented with diffserv."
2,Not worth the money,"I found this book to be a total yawn. It's a sewing book, and it's very outdated. Within a few months of buying it, I gave it away. I went on to make my own hats using adapted vintage patterns. Don't waste your time, find more modern means! Like Juliet Bawden's Hat Book"
5,Awsome book !!,"While at the library, I found their copy and read through it.. After spending all my time with this book, I just had to have one of my own :) If you like costuming, this is a great book to finish off any outfit; whether new or old."
3,"low rating for the writing, not the game","My last edition was 4.0, and after picking up the new rules I have to say that the writing quality has gone way down over the last 15 years. This is still a great game, but the 4.0 rules by Sandy Peterson were the best: extremely well written, informative, explanatory, and very entertaining. I remember lying in the park reading this, just for fun. In the new edition, the rules have been updated and new monsters and phobias added, all to the good, but the writing pretty much stinks."
4,A few of the finer moments of 90s darkwave,"Hearkening back to the glorious melodic depression of such acts as pre-90s Clan of Xymox and The Cure (Disintegration era), Ninth Circle finds themselves with some very foreboding potential to fulfill. At times, they fall flat on their faces; it's obvious that they're not yet ready for greatness, as some tracks wash out in a noisy mess (a la Soul Whirling Somewhere), while others simply wander astray. But I don't hate this! It's actually quite impressive. One listen to Deliver Me, and all is forgiven. The Ninth Circle is an act that specializes in achingly beautiful moments, but sometimes have difficulty mainting a song-length structure. If you can endure a few awkward moments, the best of what's here is sure to delight you."
5,The Beauty of Melancholy,"This album is Darkwave at its best. Etheral, brooding, at times chilling...Ninth Circle create mesmerizing cascades of enveloping soundscapes. Dive in, you might not want to get out..."
5,A Foolproof Plan,"Buy this cd. You will love some of the tracks intensely. Then, go buy the original cd's those tracks appeared on. Soon you will love those cd's and every song on this one (except maybe 1 or 2) and you will have to own the entire Old 97's catalog. Maybe it costs you around $100 total. But it will give you years of intense listening pleasure. It's the best deal ever. Plus you can catch them playing a show and even though you know all the songs by heart, they will still make you smile ear to ear. Trust me.If you're really head over heals after all that, get Rhett's solo stuff. You'll like that as well. And if you're a metro-sexual type, be sure to get his latest release ""the believer"" because you will like the picture on the cover."
4,First taste of Old 97's was Awesome,"I love this CD, especially breaking it out a friendly get togethers. It was perfect for our camping trip beach bonfire."
5,I love the Old 97's!,"You can't beat this CD. If you like rockabilly and the Old 97's this is a great collection of some of their best work, in my opinion."
1,Hardwood Spades and Site,The site has a horrible card program which has patterns galore. Easy to beat. Online site has way too many 1 bids and 6 or more bids. To me they took a horrible game program and tried to hide it with fancy foom features. Way too much drama on the site. Horrible theme and certainly not worth the money you pay. Free spades sites have better card programs and a lot less hassles.
5,nice luxury item,"I am a caterer. I bought an earlier model which I have used constantly. It is expensive, it uses up a lot of counter space and since it is heavy, you need to be able to dedicate a space just for it. It is easy to use, makes fabulous ice cream, reliable and fast. Once you get used to homemade ice cream it's very hard to go back to commercial stuff. Also makes great sorbets. This would make a great gift to someone who has lots of counter space, loves kitchen toys and ice cream. It also makes a great present to oneself. For any caterer who does small dinners I would say it definitely allows you to expand your offerings and despite its hefty fee can be a real money maker."
2,I'm sure it's a good ice cream maker...,"I'm sure Simac makes a great ice cream maker, but unfortunately I must have gotten a dud. I tried making two batches of ice cream, two different recipes. The mixture didn't even get cold on both, in fact it whiped the first one into a foam. It was very easy to set up because it's ready to go out of the box. I followed the instructions exactly, I let it sit on it's right side overnight the first night, I made sure the coils were dry, etc... Yet, it still didn't work. I would hate to tell someone not to get it because mine didn't work, but my view is certainly tainted because it didn't work. I won't give it 1 star simply because the majority of the reviews were mostly successes, so I'm giving it 2 stars."
4,Perfect racquet for the price,"This is a great racquet for the price, it is so light, you might forget you are holding it, and the strings are great, very tight!"
3,Light infinite,"If you are interested in infinity and you are not familar with Cantor or Borges' ""The Library of Babel"", then you may be amazed by this book. Otherwise, you can find it too light. Probably good as a light summer reading.Infinity is a fascinating subject, and I thought that this book would contain a lot of interesting information in its 300 pages. I have found many quotations, a lot of superficial theology and ethics, and little information on the concept itself. I missed more depth in handling the mathematical concepts.Anyway, there is a very good part of the book (from my point of view) devoted to eternal inflation and simulated universes, especially for how the theories are introduced and chained. Even if it is not strictly related to infinity, it is the best part of the book. The chapter that describes Cantor's works is worth reading too."
3,"Good, not great.","Good table, not the greatest, but my wife and I newly-weds had to purchase something on the fly. Overall, I think if you have the funds purchase something a bit more sturdy. The table looks nice, but it is quite delicate."
4,Looks like the pic,The product came quickly and looks just like the paper. My only warning is the styrofoam packaging made the biggest mess. None of the styrofoam held together so be sure to open it somewhere you can easily sweep up.
5,Good Quality,"When I first got these speakers I thought they were garbage because they were crackling when I hooked them up. A friend told me that they have to be broken in so I had to play my stereo at low volumes then raise the volume higher and higher. Now I can turn my stereo all the way up and these speakers sound fantastic, it has clear mids, and clear highs, and the crackling noise went away."
3,A Shameful Chapter in America's Racial History,"Using newspaper articles as its primary source of information, this book chronicles a famous American trial set in the 1920s. A white man from one of the richest families in New York sued his bride for an annulment, charging that she had deceived him about her race. The trial mesmerized the nation with its subtexts of star-crossed lovers, sex, money, and miscegenation. The authors explore the then-accepted guidelines for racial identification and how those principles failed to provide easy resolution in this case. While Love on Trial explores an example of America's shameful racial history, the authors too frequently interrupt a compelling story to remind the reader about the trial's cultural context--including a boring discourse on Al Jolson and his blackface routine. Nevertheless, the book provides insight into our country's unique discomfort about race and, in the process, reminds us that we haven't progressed as far as we might have hoped."
3,Thought provoking yet....,"This book was recommended by my Dean, so of course I had to read it. The issues raised in this book are very thought provoking. What does it mean to be Black in America? Who is Black? Does the media influence or reflect the views of society? I enjoyed this book although the writing was at time sensationalized. Most of the information comes from newspaper archives which the writers then interpret, so we never really hear from Rhinelander or Alice in their own words. It was interesting that people in the North felt they were less racist than the South, yet they continued to provide coverage of the case along the same racial lines. Goes to show, same racism, new face. Overall, this book wasn't bad."
3,Yes and No,The visors seem to be good quality but on my Honda Pilot (95) the passenger visor stops the window from closing completely. I have tried adjusting this several times but to no avail. The drivers side is fine. The rear visors use tape and one cracked the first time the windows was closed.
2,Poorly Done,"I was looking for a book that described the waterfalls of Utah. This is not it. The author does not do a good job of listing or telling about the waterfalls of the area. Poor directions and descriptions of the falls, counting one falls as several to bring the numbers up and counting 3-5 foot drops as falls. Needless to say not what I was looking for."
4,Very good guide for Utah Travelers,"If your heading to Utah I would recommend this book, the writer of this book has black and white photo's of each waterfall he listed in his book, near the middle of the book he does have 16 pages of color photo's of waterfalls.As far as the detail on how to get to the falls, he does a pretty good job on giving that- only complaint is he has no maps whatsoever in the book.At the end of the book, the writer gives his top ten list of the waterfalls in Utah- which I did like, although in order to find the waterfalls in his top ten list's you have to search through the index page."
4,Maybe the best Dave Douglas album,"I haven't heard them all, but this disc--one of his first--seems to really have great energy and exploration...it is like a manifesto, declaring possibilities. ""Remains"" is beautiful. The talented rhythm section is good at free stuff, but NOT at Ellington--should have left ""Loco Madi"" off."
1,Not a book!,I downloaded this title and there was no book! Just a blank page indicating that I was halfway through the book. I guess this was a publishing error.
5,"Smooth, perfect, I've never had a problem",I love these pens and have converted everyone at my workplace to them. I've never had the leaking issues others have complained about and its been over a year.
3,"Write nice, but leak","I'm very picky about my pens. I like them to be extra fine and write smooth. When these don't leak, they are perfect; however, I had two leak all over my hands and one in my pants. For that reason I had to trash them."
3,"OK sound, well-built, but poor packaging","Upon opening the package I was presented with cracked and broken styrofoam and a disintegrated knob on one of the speaker brackets.However, the sound is okay, good mids. Highs are not strong, and the speaker is not very efficient. It is also highly directional. The 70-volt tap selector knob is located along with banana posts behind a rubber flap. The speakers appear to be ruggedly built.I will be using these speakers for sound effects (crickets and tree critters) in my halloween graveyard. 70-volt is the way to go to keep cable gauge thin and cheap."
5,Fantastic!,This is a fantastic dvd! Specially the brodsword concert. I never get tired to see it! Long live Jethro Tull!!!!!
2,Irregular quality,"This is a mix-up of old materials. Recorded shows, mostly. The first songs, for instance, were recorded quite a long time, and the image quality is very poor (sometimes, appallingly poor: lots of grain). Sound is not too good, either, at least in the first songs. I'd say it's not up to a minimum quality standard, frankly. I wouldn't bother to buy it if I've got other DVDs with Jethro Tull material. Only for Jethro Tull fanatics who must to have everything the band has published...From a quality point of view, I'd go better with""Jethro Tull: Live at Montreux"" or, yet better,""Ian Anderson Plays the Orchestral Jethro Tull"" DVDs"
3,"""OK""","It seems so hard to find good Jethro Tull video. It's ok, but don't find myself viewing that much."
5,Moved from beginning to end,Simply inspiring! This movie moved me from beginning to end. And to think that a 16 year-old is behind all this phenomenon... I am starting my collection of this young filmmaker who I have no doubt will be huge soon!
5,George Foreman,Really Good Book If you have a Lean Fat Reducing Machine work through the American Isums and you'll be Enjoying Fabulous Food In no Time.
3,Sondra,I liked the book but I had to wait 3 weeks for it! I had ordered 3 other items at the same time from different sellers and got them all in 3-4 days I was very disappointed that it took that long. When I contacted the seller they were nice about it and told me they forgot to send it :(
5,Foreman grill cookbook,"I ordered a used ccokbook on the George Foreman Grill. I had been unable to find one at any local bookstore, including 2 of the large chain stores. I paid 75 cents plus shipping. The book arrived in excellent condition and has already been worth the expense. It arrived on the date promised."
2,not worth it,"Maybe because I do not use cookbooks other than as reference books, but it is not worth buying. I can't even tell you were I put it."
5,worth the extra cost,"After years of buying products based on price, just to have to replace or upgrade later I finally learned to buy quality FIRST. Although this wringer cost a little more than most, it was worth it. The galvanized steel construction is very sturdy and rugged. The lever action is very strong, yet smooth. Yes, it is just a mop wringer, no reason to get too excited. But if you want a product that does what it's supposed to do, and will be doing it for a while, this will do the job. I've had it for a little over a year now, and it is holding up great."
2,world in conflict,save your money.The world at War series or Nazis;A Warning from history are a much superior product.Conflict is more like a timeline of the war without going into depth of the war or the causes.
3,Careful! Minor Fraud here!,"I was looking for the old model of the VBall grip. Hoping to find an online retailer with some remaining stock. The PICTURE is of the old model. The old model is larger, more comfortable and has a larger longer lasting ink supply. I was sent two boxes of the new model instead of the one pictured. Not worth returning but it was not what I thought I was ordering."
4,LOVED IT!!,So i love Erin Mccarthy as a author and this was the first book i ever read from her so i wanted to buy my own copy since i didnt have it....and amazon was amazing i got my book like two days before they were suppose to come but the only thing i didnt like way they left them outside of my building where anyone could have taken them.....goodthing i have good neighbours and they brought the package to me
1,100% TRASH!,"This book was not at all what I had anticipated. First, it is not even a full-length book, but a collection of 3 short stories that are loosely centered around online dating/emails. The stories are about 70 pages each, and if you believe a great story can be completed in that small of a space, then you won't have a problem with this book. However, if you're looking for quality writing, characters with more than one dimension, and a storyline that is interesting and exciting, then you will hate this book. The three short stories are basically just sex scenes - there is no substance, no connection between the characters, and the scenes aren't even ""hot."" Skip this book.. save your hard-earned money."
2,hot but no chemistry,"I give this new author kudos for her wonderful sense of humor and steamy love scenes. But I didn't feel attached to the characters at all. It was about sex and humor but certainly not about romance. And while I enjoy a steamy book, I am a romance reader first and foremost. This book lacked romance."
5,Lo tienes que comprar/You have to buy it!,"Yo he sido fanatica de Enrique Iglesias por mucho tiempo (antes de que aprendé a hablar bien el español). Este disco tiene todas sus mejores canciones (menos los nuevos). Si tú eres un fan de Enrique, lo necesita en su colección.I have been a fan of Enrique Iglesias for a long time (before I was fluent in Spanish). This disc has all of his best songs (except the new ones). If you are a fan of Enrique Iglesias, you need this CD for your collection."
4,Takes me back to my childhood.,I got this for my two-year-old because she was all of a sudden interested in my old care bear dolls - the movie is pretty dated (although it pains me to say). She still loves it and asks to watch it all the time.
4,"So happy with the content, but my DVDs skip","This is the original Care Bears I grew up watching and loved. I am so happy to have them on DVD, but my DVD continually skips. Making it quite difficult to watch."
4,Topless cheerleader zombie,"Need I say more? This girl is fine so fine I wish she were mine. Except I don't, cause shes a zombie! She'd wanna eat me, and I'd wanna let her. I Rather her than the killer animals and sicko monsters thats chasing everybody!eating poeple! When the one hotshot got sawed in half all my friends and me peed in my pantsThey kep making me watch it and I kep going crazy. If you are scared of scary movies because of blood then you will still be scared, but I think its cool and so I will watch this and laugh like crazy."
4,Beautiful book,"Beautiful pictures, beautiful text. Cynthia Rylant is lyrical in describing nature's organisms. These animal stories emphasize the diversity of nature and some of the curiosities of animal behavior that can really grab the imagination and encourage further questioning.By the way, the two previous reviews are inaccurate. Rylant does mention monarchs in Mexico and her timetable for the migration doesn't conflict with the presence of monarchs in Iowa in Sept. or in Texas in Oct. The book is accurate on these points."
1,Gift purchase,Disappointed by quality of item. Too fragile and thin and discolored on back of charm. If not returnable I will not be ordering from Amazon or this jeweler in the future. Thank you
4,Where is Chieli?,"This is another great effort from an outstanding musician. However, the second half of the CD fades a bit after hearing the first five tracks. His prior CD, Jewel, is one of the finest recordings I have ever heard. Where does this man perform? I would dearly love to see him live."
4,Greatest Smooth Guitarist Today,"Cheili is wonderful in the song Dreams but the rest of the album falls a little below his standards. I love the Renaissance album that has Anything & Everything, Because We Ended as Lovers, and Reunion, my favorite album I own in my library. I also like his new album Sweet On You. I wish I knew how I could buy the album with Phat City on it though.If you own any of these albums, don't get rid of them, they are priceless"
5,The fullest examination yet,"The small book contains a wealth of information on that geological wonder, the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The author covers everything from the history of people's interest in it, through the flora and fauna of the area. The book is quite interesting, and my one (and only) complaint is that the book does not contain a comprehensive map of the Causeway."
5,No Complaints,"I damaged the one on one of my bathroom sinks while ""fixing"" a leak. Ordered this one. It arrived quickly, and was exactly what I needed. No more leak."
1,Headache & Heartache for Beginners,"This book is good if you already know how things work in Maya.If you are a beginner you will feel like someone dumped an 18-wheeler truck on you. The descriptions of tools and how things work are barely explained and then you are given exercises to do using those tools. The exercises say to start with a shape as shown in the picture and then ""tweak"" the shape until it looks like the other picture shown. I don't see how that can be called instructional. Unfortunately, how to get from one to the other is a complete mystery. I unsuccessfully spent several hours just trying to get anything accomplished with this book. I don't feel like I learned anything. The book seems to be written for those who know Maya's basics and want to get on with building. If you are new to Maya, AVOID this book. I am good at learning new programs generally speaking, but this book makes it hard and not fun."
3,Not so good,"Almost all the chapter files on the cd would open with errors, so they were practically useless. And for Ch.7 it says there are reference pictures on the cd for the throwing exercise, but there are no pictures. Also, there's a bunch of little typo's, but that's forgivable. This book is really easy and fast to read, I consider myself a beginner, but I guess I was a little more advanced than what this book had to offer. Overall, this is a decent book, but it isn't as great as everyone has been saying...."
2,What's the web got to do with it?,"The ""Internet"" content is amusing, it's a lame device to tie scenes together. Nearly every one opens with a girl deciding she's tired of the damn computer so she's going to do a nice dance for us. Mostly boring, not enough skin. One exception is a nice bit for the redhead lovers among us."
3,Great idea for aging dogs,"I bought this jogging kit to convert the pet bicycle trailer into a jogging trailer for my 13 year old springer spainiel who is 55 pounds. It is a great way for us (our lab & I) to get to walk fast while also bringing our springer with us. The one drawback is the tire is unstable. It has a lock to keep it in the forward motion, but it creates a problem for turning, etc. When you don't lock the front tire, it wobbles constantly. But it's better than not bringing our doggie with us."
5,Power to the people,The marina where we keep our houseboat has only 125V and 250V 50 Amp service to the slips. My previous marina had 30 Amp service. My cable is a 30 amp cable. The Marinco adapter works perfectly - no problems! This adapter is super quality. It will probably outlast the boat. The price from Amazon was $35.00 plus shipping less than from West Marine.
1,A power Cord I never Got,I have been requested to write a review of a power cord that I never got. Let me explain.The address I sent the cord to is a Self Storage business that we have been using to send ordered items to for 1 1/2 years. We have had over 30 delivers without a problem until now. I get an e-mail from Amazon that the cord is undeliverable. So it is really hard to review this item. They have refunded my money and said I will have to reorder it to get it. I was not informed of the non delivery until over a month after the purchase. I am very dispointed in the service.Richard
2,Tuscany is great! This book is a bore.,"Well, at least most of the book is boring. The idea is nice, but how much fun can you derive from reading about piazzas, pizzas, macaronis and great views. Pasta is to eat, wine to drink and people - to meet. Reading about them is so much less fun. So if you want to read about Tuscany before going there - take a travel guide or history book. This one - if you can't fall asleep."
5,Funniest strip around,Dave Kellett's Sheldon has long been one of my favorite comic strips. This first collection of Sheldon contains the best of the best from the first few years of the strip. The humor ranges from family-oriented to geek-oriented to completely off-the-wall. This is a book that truly has laughs for everyone. I can't recommend it highly enough.
3,"Save your $$, buy a metal mandoline.","There is part of the mandoline that continues to dislodge during use (this could be extremely dangerous, as the blade is very sharp.). I now wish I had spent more $ and purchased a metal mandoline. On the positive side, when the ""part"" does remain in place, it does a fairly good job of slicing medium to small items."
2,Too Cumbersome,"I've only used it for onions, and was not pleased. I could not get it to sit still. The top pusher thing did not ""bite"" into the onion, so never got a good grip. I tried with both blade sizes and one was not any better than the other. It would be easier for me to chop by hand. I am unhappy with it. It will either sit on a shelf, or go in the garbage. Oh yeah, I cut my finger and bled like a stuck pig. I couldn't get my finger to stop bleading for about an hour. When it says to be careful, it isn't joking. If you even look at it the wrong way, it'll cut you."
3,For soft veggie only,"I had this mandoline for 1/2 yr now. It was working fine at the beginning. Made the mistake of running a couple of sweet potatos on this. Now, it's a goner. Only made for softer veggies, but then again for the price, you can't expect much."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is a basic instance of ""You get what you pay for."" It's not a great device, but it isn't horrible.I'm mostly writing this review inresponse to a reviewer who said ""Inserts don't stay in place. Need to hold them in place with one hand while slicing with the other. If you don't the back end will pop up at the end of each stroke and your slices will be wedge shaped.""With my unit, at least, if you press the inserts down hard in all corners they stay in place fine. They do snap into place, and if you look underneath there's notches that fit, but you have to press kinda hard to fit them into place.More control of thickness and sturdier julien blades would greatly improve this device. As I said, you get what you pay for, and this is the cheapest Mandolin I've seen..."
4,Good product for the cost,Preformend as advertized. A word of safety is needed because it has an exposed very sharp blade. Watch how much you cut as the slices pile up underneath the mandoline. Large vegtables like a cucumber you will want to cut into sections and then slice.
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this item to help my small ones in the kitchen thinking it would be safer for them to use than a regular grater. This item is dangerous. The inserts pop out easily when in use and create a hazard as well as being ineffiencient and difficult, to say the least."
1,slicer is terrible!,This slicer is not even worth the $10 I paid for it. It ended up costing me $50 in a co-pay to the emergency room to get stiches when the guard fell off the vegetable I was trying to slice...but it put a nice slice in my finger!!! Don't buy this item it is very dangerous!
2,Decent for the price...,"Good tool if you are trying to decide if you want to buy a real one. The blades are sharp enough but the spacers fall out pretty easy. You can't do waffle fries with it's attatchments, which was my whole reason for oredering this. Worth this price."
2,Siamese Twin Julliene Cutter,"I can almost excuse the fact that you can not slice the entire vegetable, since you keep your fingers safe. Almost.If you want nearly julliened carrots, this baby is for you. The cutter blades are not quite tall enough to actually separate the shoe string potatoes or carrots. If you have the time and interest, you can separate them by hand.No thanks. I sent mine off to the second hand store."
1,"Spend more, get more","The whole thing was a let-down, but I am completely disappointed in the julienne attachment. The gripper/finger protector doesn't hold on to potatoes or carrots, and I cut myself trying to push them through with my hands. To be fair, I didn't get mine from Amazon; the same one is sold through (elsewhere). Caveat emptor."
2,you get what you pay for,"I bought this for about 8 bucks at the store, thinking that if it sucked I wasn't out much money. It really only works on hard vegetables, and the plastic actually bends with downward pressure. Thus, the slices may not be completely even in thickness. Also, the thinnest setting is not as thin as we had hoped. And the blade was not that sharp out of the box, I had a hard time just cutting through sweet potatoes. We'll probably toss it and go for a professional model that will last and work better. At least it only cost $8."
2,zig zag........,"i thought all you had to do was to push the veggies thru the blade and it would cut clean and straight. no, no, mon frere you have to zig zag if you want a clean cut."
4,Slicer,"This Mandoline slicer is very good. It is light weight and easy to use. The different blades are easy to change. I also like that you can put it on a bowl or pan and cut right into what ever you are making, and it doen't move around while on the bowl. It is also very easy to wash. Another thing I like is the gripper for the food you are cutting so you don't slice your fingers. If you are in the market for nothing to fancy this one is it. It is reasonably priced also."
2,Consider the Hoffritz instead,"A mandoline is only as good as how frequently you use it (this is probably true of any 'gadget'). I bought the Hoffritz model a few weeks ago an would recommend the upgrade for a few important features:1) the bowl -- the Hoffritz model has a built in bowl (large) that allows absolutely no slippage when you're working. This allows for zero danger with the blades, and no wrestling when it comes to stubborn vegetables.2) the bowl -- the bowl doubles as a storage for all the blades (there is a little rack as well) and parts. You pack it up and it takes up very modest space.3) the blades -- the Hoffritz blades are so sharp (they make knives) that you occasionally have to check to see if you're actually cutting anything.4) the body -- very well constucted. If all goes well, this will survive a busy kitchen for a long time."
1,Mandoline Slicer,"I thought this product was going to be great because my parents had the ""original Borner V-slicer"" and it was awesome but I was totally disappointed when I received this. I have to admit that the blades are sharp but the most disappointing thing was the round guard that is supposed to grip the food. Perhaps this just happens with mine, but I have alot of problems getting it to hold on to a tomato or potato (they hook on then when I try to slide it over the slicer it rolls off, the prongs are just not long enough)."
1,don't waste your money & save the landfill space,"I just chimed in to add a one-star rating. The product is flimsy, a pain to change blades (& they pop out anyway), and lost sharpness after 2 or 3 uses. Everything now gets stuck under the blade halfway thru a slice. This thing is landfill fodder."
3,Works well for the price,"Again, you get what you pay for. My middle finger is still healing from a nasty cut. I have never used a mandolin before but the ones I see chefs using are much nicer with a chute device to hold the veggie so you NEVER have to nick your finger. It works good enough for what I need it for though."
4,The Happy Slicer...,I love this item.I've only used It a couple time so far.It did a nice job shredding cabbage for coleslaw and slicing onions for burgers.It's a fun item to use.
3,Mandoline Slicer,I purchased this item to make shoestring sweet potatoes. It doesn't cut the potato all the way through so that I have to separate all the little pieces. Very annoying. I have to use a lot of pressure to get it to pass over the blade. Cheap price. Cheap product. Pay a little more and get a better one. Wish I did.
1,Useless.,"Found ""protective"" handle of no value in slicing potatoes. One can slice ""semi"" thick or ""semi"" thin. Slicing shoestring size, marginal, at best."
1,You Don't Always Get What You Pay For,"Inexpensive compared to other mandolin type slicers, so my expectations were not high. Even so, this item is a waste of money.Only two thicknesses for slices. Both too thick for potato chips.Inserts don't stay in place. Need to hold them in place with one hand while slicing with the other. If you don't the back end will pop up at the end of each stroke and your slices will be wedge shaped.Large julienne insert makes good french fries (if you hold it in place), but the vertical blades get bent too easily.Too small! A russet potato is a couple of inches too long to use without cutting off an inch or two. So if you like your fries long, forget it.Pay a few extra bucks and get something useful."
3,won't break the bank,"For those times when the food processor is too much hassle. For the price, it is alright. I find the thinnest slices a bit difficult, medium and wide work better. Have yet to try the shredder or other features."
5,Mandoline Slicer,I have had it for years... wonderful and fast... you won't use your kitchen machine that often any more. Just watch your fingers. Better to use the tool to protect your fingers and do not let young children use slicer (older ones only with adult present). Once you have it you won't want to do without it. With todays need to conserve energy this is another reason to go for it! => We should challenge people to do without batteries and electricity wherever we can.
3,a good slicer,a great slicer for 7 dollarsbut i bought a electric chopper for the same priceits small enough to stay on my counterso i use it more but it doesnt slice this does
1,Very Cheap,I bought this same slicer but bought it elsewhere. Out of the box the blade was very dull. I tried slicing an onion and it only tore it up. It completly mangled a tomato. I ended up returning it and getting a refund. I would recomend spending a little more and getting a better quality slicer.
5,This book can move you to a new level with God!,"During my 23 years as a Southern Baptist minister I have found that many people try to have a devotional life that meets a ""human's standard"" rather than ""God's standard"".""Come as You Are"" will help you understand how to develop a close relationship with God without a radical pesonality change. You will find that God loves you just as you are! He is your friend!"
5,Exemplary performances,"I was drawn to this disc through an esteem for the work of Jean Tubery (cornetto) and his group La Fenice. They do play splendidly on this disc, and join Ensemble Akademia in some of the most striking music of Heinrich Schütz.Ensemble Akademia sings with precision and drama in several motets and in the central work, the Musicalische Exequien. Highlights include a vigorous reading of 'Saul, Saul was verfolgst du mich?' and moving introsepction in 'Selig sind die Toten' ( fitting counterpart to the Exequien, in which this text features). The solo contributions are perfectly sung; Hans Jörg Mammel is eloquent in 'Mit dem Amphion zwar', but Phillipe Roche's singing of 'Fili mi Absalon' is exemplary and puts Richard Wistreich and His Majesty's Sagbutts and Cornetts to shame.The Exequien is less satisfactory on the whole; Phillipe Herreweghe and La Chapelle Royale are possibly more colourless in this work, but their sense of the monumental nature of this piece is more satisfying."
2,It is not a keepsake book.,"If you are looking for a keepsake book, this is not it. A keepsake book implies you will be able to write down some of your memories and personalize the pages. All you can personalize here is placing a picture of you and your mother on the front page. If you want a book of pictures and quotes this will be fine for you. But it is not a keepsake book and you can barely personalize it at all."
5,This thing rules,"I looooove this thing. I can't believe that a little rubbery tube is so useful. I chop garlic all the time and I'm so glad my hands don't stink anymore from all that peeling, and it's so much quicker!"
5,Low Tech Time Saver That Really Works,There is no quicker or easier way to effectively peel garlic cloves without damaging them. I do an entire bulb in about 5 minutes and refrigerate the cloves for future use. Easy clean up and easy to store. This thing really works!
2,another tool can do the trick,"Ever get one of those free rubber jar openers for promotional items? They are made of about the same material, and do the same job, if you don't want to crush the garlic. They're also easier to clean, just simply rinse, or wash in soapy water."
4,A really useful product,"If you cook with garlic (if you don't, please don't invite me for dinner) you should get one of these things. They work wonderfully. I've always find peeling garlic a tedious, somewhat difficult and messy task. To be honest, I didn't think this thing would work all that well, but it was cheap so what did I have to lose? I was pleasantly surprised by how well it works. It's good, not magic - sometimes the skin will stick and break and you'll still have to do a bit of picking with your fingers. On the whole, though, it's a terrific and very useful product.Plus, you can just toss it in the dishwasher when you're done."
4,Works Well for Peeling Whole Cloves,"This gadget is great for peeling whole cloves of garlic quickly and cleanly. I use it especially when making garlic soup and garlic pizza where the recipes call for large amounts of whole peeled cloves. As well, the E-Z-Roll Garlic Peeler by Zak Designs does keep a garlic smell from transferring to my hands that happens when peeling whole cloves of garlic the traditional way..."
4,E-Z-Rol Garlic Peeler - Fun!,I bought one of these a few years ago and put it away until I moved to a new home. I just ran across it several months ago. I introduced it to my husband who loves using it. I bought nine more to give as gifts this past Christmas. Everyone has told me they enjoy using it. I like using it. It works really well and it is easy to clean.
2,Junk Drawer Status,"This currently resides unused in my junk drawer. I initially bought it to ease the pain of peeling garlic when I make 40 Clove Garlic Chicken. After 5 or 6 cloves, it's a waste of time because you have to get the skins out and they seem to like it inside and won't just come out with a sharp rap on the counter. I have better results putting the cloves in a plastic container with a lid and shaking it vigorously or blanching the garlic and slipping the skins off. I'm glad others find it useful."
5,Garlic Peeler,It makes peeling garlic a whole different experience! It is one of the greatest inventions for a kitchen to have!
2,Not so much,"This is a preliminary assessment. I will continue to work with it to see if I can make it work better but my first experience was pretty poor. The instructions say roll and press firmly until it cracks then the clove will come out peeled. Only about one or two in ten cloves worked on my first attempt. On the others, the skin wouldn't come off or the clove crushed. After a few crushed, the inside got slippery so it wouldn't work at all. I really wanted this to work. I like simple solutions. I will try again later."
5,Worthwhile gadget!,"I've lived without one of these for a very long time. Whacking a knife blade over a clove is fine for one or two at a time. When I decided to mince several heads of garlic at once, and freeze them, it didn't take me long to realize I didn't want to live without one of these any longer. Wish I'd realized that sooner, and just bought it from Amazon. Many miles later in high heat and humidity, going in and out of stores, I was finally able to get back to my garlic, and finished it off in short order."
1,Not Zak brand,"I used to own a Zak E-z-rol garlic peeler, but it's missing, so I needed to replace it.Once the idem arrived, I had a feeling it wasn't really Zak brand since it didn't come in the plastic tube my other one came in. After using it about 4 times, I know that this is a poor knock off-the product just doesn't work as well as the Zak brand garlic peeler I had before--the material is not the same and it works, but not even as close as the other one I had."
2,Not as helpful as I thought,"I thought it would really be helpful when peeling garlic. While it did finally get the job done, It took several attempts. I found it hard to use on my granite surface without sliding around."
2,Unnecessary and low productivity.,"It does the job of peeling garlic, though not always on the first try.It gets dirty fast because garlic peels sort of stick to the inside. It's very easy to clean, but then you lose the time savings which it was supposed to deliver. If you want to peel more than a couple of cloves, it's a big nuisance.And it's simply unnecessary. To peel garlic, put it down on the cutting board (or counter) and whack it with the flat side of any tool (I use whatever chef's knife or cleaver is sitting around, or even the bottom of a can). The peel will come right off."
4,"Neat idea, and yes, it is a gimmick","This maybe quite gimicky like another reviewer said, but some gimmicks are quite useful. Mybe if you do not use much garlic then you will only be buying 'another tool' for the drawer. But if like me you use alot of garlic, then this will be of great benefit. I myself have not personally used this, I saw it used somewhere, and wanted one so bad, but I had forgotten my wallet at home, DOH, and was unable purchase one on the spot. But for now it is on my wishlist."
1,I never needed this!,"I agree with the below! Why it is on the ""necessary kitchen gadgets lists"" I do not know! It just sits collecting dust in my drawer, especially with its sticky material. You still gotta place a good amount of pressure on the garlic to mash it when you could do the same with a flick of the wrist with the flat side of a big knife! Waste of money."
5,Wicked fast and clean,"Beats the heck out of peeling a head of garlic by hand. No knife no sticky, stinky fingers Love it!"
3,Too Big not good,"It would be perfect if it was a bit smaller it gets too loose and don't peel very well because of that i would rated 5 starts otherwise, but is not good enough.I wanna returned but its not worth it the hustle, its better just not to buy this one, buy a smaller one."
4,"Fun kitchen gadget, good for kids","If you're trying to get your kids to help out in the kitchen, this will help them see cooking as fun. Rolling the little tube is very easy (just press down a bit as you're doing it) and is the right size for little hands.I use mine mostly when I'm making roasted garlic - shucking 5 garlic heads can take a lot of time, so I thought I'd give this a try. While it's fun to use, it takes a while to actually get the garlic skins off. Instead, I've been using it to 'crack' the skin off and then peel it off by hand which does save me some time. Roll once or twice then shuck. Otherwise, you do have to clean it out every two or three cloves, and if you use water then it takes forever to get going again - this is the reason why I'm only giving this four stars."
5,Peeler,No more smelly hands. Peels the garlic like it advertises. Wonderful. Would make a great stocking stuffer for a cooker.
5,Works great,If you want to peel garlic this is the way to do it. You put it in the E-Z peeler and roll it and the skin comes off. Wish I had invented it.
2,Change purse,"I was so excited about ordering this item. However the description of this change purse is not what I received,. There are NO INSIDE SLOTS for credit cards. I am very disappointed."
2,Keeper stake pocket anchor,This may work on a different pickup body but not on my 2003 Chevy 2500HD. I threw them away and bought some Bull Ring brand.
1,MSD sucks,"I bought this for my roadmaster wagon with a lt1. After installing the car ran horribly, upon investigating it was discovered that the spark was arching through the MSD cap to the engine. I replaced it with a delphi unit and the car runs great. Contacted MSD and they told me ""it is a racing unit and carries no warranty"". So now I have a 150 dollar wall decoration in my garage to remind me about this adventure. Never again will I trust MSD."
3,No Screws,"The actual cleats were exactly as specified. They fit perfectly, but I did not realize that they did not come with screws. If this fact was noted in the description, I missed it. The cleats I replaced were from an a 1990 model boat, so the screws were machined into the cleat. Note that the Home Depot or Lowes does not carry the exact, flat head, screws to fit these cleats. You will need to go to a store specializing in hard to find hardware."
4,"Good, basic introduction!","Having never studied Italian before, I am finding the Beginner's Italian audiopackage to be a nicely paced introduction to the language. Each chapter introduces a manageable amount of new vocabulary and builds upon the lessons of the preceding chapter. Although I haven't looked into the Pimsleur Italian series, it would probably complement the Teach Yourself Italian well.My primary criticism (and reason for giving 4 rather than 5 stars) is of the rather slim dictionary at the back of the book. At the very least, this should contain all of the vocabulary introduced in the text. As it stands, I have to hunt through past chapters when I invariably forget some of the vocabulary."
3,ok...,"i actually liked the plot. And the drawings are just different. It is possible that they were drawn by different people. I rather like how they look like sketches that someone could have done at home. I think that is you like scifi-ish work and you're into manga for the story, you should get it. As for the whale and then destrorer... i have no clue how that happened... hmm..."
2,Not up to par,"While I like the storyline to this game, the game play just isn't that good. It's a very easy game to beat. My recomendation... download the free demo for this thing before you buy it. Decide then."
5,Sunday Bloody Sunday,"great game. finally something that isn't orcs or gods - been done over and over, yet that is all you ever see. highland warriors gives you something new - a look back and the chance to play with history. william wallace, robert the bruce and king edy I are brought to life with you at the controls. want to know why they called this the bloodiest time in history - well just strap on your sword, prepare your longbow and load the catapult and you will be thrust into the center of the battle. yes - i mean the center of battle for the camera zooms in for close ups, something you never see in a rts. the graphics are great but the voices are somewhat annoying but you get to remove all the buttons from the screen so you can see all the action. if you like the movie braveheart, you will love this game."
2,Buggy and lacks finesse,"This game ""Highland Warriors"" is a result of some great ideas and and some nice intentions that was very poorly implemented.What is the point in having awesome graphics, when the released game can be at best described as a beta software. You create one user profile and next time you start the game u see 4 user profiles with the same name !!! Every time a in game cinemetics appear, you can go and have a nap. What is the use if you need a super computer for this? More over the audio in the in game videos are almost inaudible. Not to speak of instability.If the creators of the game, provide a patch that fixes these bugs, this game will be worth hours of gameplay.On a positive side, the graphics are fantastic, story line is impressive.[ My system details: P4 2.4GHZ( 533 MHz Bus) 512 DDR RAM, Geforce3]"
2,disappointment,"I saw this game at best buy for only 20 bucks, and I love the time period, the graphics on the back looked cool so I gave it a shot. Unfortunatly I got kinda bored with it within a couple of minutes.This game is nothing but eye candy, the graphics are great, but there is no strategy involved at all. At least with games like AOK, there is strategy involved with balacing military units. One redeeming quality could have been the online play, but hardly anyone likes this game enough to play it online.It's just the same old RTS game with much less depth than a game like warcraft or age of empires. I'd recommend this game to someone 12 years of age or under who just likes to see cool warriors fighting, but not for adults."
5,"Tough , easy to use player at excellent price","I've had mine for almost 2 years, and really enjoy it. It's the size of a lipstick tube, comes with a well designed neck-cord to which the ear-buds are attached. To load with music, I plug it directly through the usb on my computer, drag and drop music files, and am good to go. It runs off a single AAA battery, so it's easy enough to keep an extra one around if it runs out. It does in fact, have a battery monitor on the main screen. I plug mine into a cute little cigarette lighter adapter in my car, to play my tunes through my car stereo. It's been quite reliable and even survived a stow-away trip through the washing machine (Clean as a whistle and still plays). Can't ask for more than that : ) The only thing I would add to this little gem is an FM tuner."
2,run small and short,I ordered this lounge pants for my son who is 5'10 and size 32..I ordered them Medium (32-34) and they are very small and not long enough. The pants don't even fall close to his ankle. I am returning them....Consider that they are not sized correctly before you count on them as a Christmas gift.... I am glad I opened the package and checked them early!
4,Pastor in Texas,"A helpful overview of Joshua by a respected authority. Generally helpful on some troublesome passages with good exegesis. The only drawback was that it didn't really deal with some of the questions that I personally--and I presume other pastors--would have liked a broader treatment on. Woudstra does not have a fondness for higher criticism, a factor that too often pervades many commentaries on Joshua. His is a solid if not sterling commentary."
2,some interesting interpretations,"The author of the text presented some interesting positions; none of these were unexpected. The text was written from a very conservative point of view. After having read the text and having reflected upon what I've read, there was nothing new or interesting about the writing. It was not a bad approach to reviewing the Book of Joshua; it was one that left this reader with a sense of ""Why did this author write this book."" The age of the text could have had an influence upon the overall impressions from the text. Those having an interest in the structure, influences, and historical issues facing Joshua and his followers will not find this text very supportive."
5,THE PRICE IS RIGHT!!!,"This was a very impressive CD for what I paid for it (under ten bucks). ""The Chillout Room"" is full of rare gems and musical unknowns. Songs 1,4,5,10 and 11 are my personal favorites and will definitely get you going! The rest of the songs on this CD aren't bad either--very moody, dreamy, dark and uplifting. If you're just out browsing the local music store like I often do (probably more than I should) and are just wanting to buy a CD, this is the one to get, pending it's availablity, of course."
3,Chillout Room: Cool Grooves,"Although there are other various artists chillout CD's available at an unusually expensive price tag, for mellow background music this CD is not bad for the price."
2,Works for a While,"I love the writing qualities of this pen. I buy the black and red pens by the 5 pack. BUT... I can't believe they have never figured out a way to keep them writing. In the years I've been using them I've never had one run out of inkl because about 3 weeks after I pick it up for the first time the ink shudders to a stop and I have to throw it away. I've tried cleaning the point, pushing it, pulling it,shaking it, and think there must be a gallon of ink left in all the pens I've tossed. Same goes for all colors not just the black. Must be a touch of sadism in a company that can make such a good writing instrument but that cannot keep it writing"
3,Just OK,I was hoping my quest for the perfect pens were over after buying these but the quest will continue. The first pen seem to work fine till I used up about 1/4 of the ink and then the ink just didn't flow as nice and evenly anymore. I've noticed the same issue with even new ones.
3,Fountain Pen Vs Ballpoint,"My first rolling ball, I apologize if this is rough butNot a big fan, it does not work well without high quality paper.That high quality paper is better off with fountain pen ink."
5,These are the only pens I use,"This is the best disposable pen you can buy. I have used these pens for 15 years now and they are fantastic. They write easily and smoothly without any dry spots. (No more scribbling on scrap paper to get your pen working again!) The liquid ink lasts for months and the window makes it is easy to guage how much ink is remaining. The extra fine point makes precise work a breeze. Just be careful of the needle tips, which are quite sharp."
5,Best pens ever,"I've been using these pens for years. Was able to save some money buying these here in a box. This is my favorite pen, period. I usually carry one in my pants pocket, never had any leaking problems, it's always reliable and makes nice crisp clean dark lines when you write."
5,These Pens Are AWESOME!,"I bought these at a local store, not on amazon.com. They are perfect if you need that fine point, and the ink flows out perfectly. They last awhile as well."
4,"Smooth lines, no smearing.","It writes very smooth thin lines. I've only had 1 dry out on me and I tend to leave my pens caps off regularly. Ink dries almost instantly so there is no smearing. If you're somebody who often forgets to check your pockets when washing clothes, avoid these. I have ruined some clothes due to my laziness, if you have this issue check out the Zebra 301 pens, they don't explode in the wash."
2,Used 4 so far; 2 have been dead.,"I really like these pens; and I really want to give this a high rating ... but:so far, I've used 4 pens. 2 worked flawlessly. 2 just ""died"" -- the ink barrel is nearly full, yet ink barely comes out, regardless of high light of hard I push the pen tip against paper."
5,Great writing stick,"I love the Pilot Precise V5 for the fantastically low drag writing.I spend a lot of time writing notes and need something that doesn't make me work to write, which is why I dislike regular ball point pens so much.I find the blue colored ink stands out much better than the black ink.Crank up the production line, Pilot! We need more of these pens!Andy"
1,These are NOT 0.25mm pens - these are 0.50mm pens.,"I thought these were 0.25mm pens (like it says in the title for the item), but these are NOT 0.25mm pens - these are 0.50mm pens. Read the rest of the description (Product Specifications) of the item and you'll seen. I'm sure this pen is great for 98% of the people out there that want a ""fine"" point pen - but I know what a 0.25mm pen is like - it's great! These are just pens... back to JetPens for writing ...Okay, day after complaining and preparing to send the pens back, someone changed the product description to read ""0.25mm"". In that case, Amazon did not send my order correctly (this would be a first, Amazon has never mad that mistake in 100+ orders). However, the pens I received are not the ones pictured...The return process was very easy, full refund."
4,Rare Gem Worth A Listen,This is a very hard to find record from the now long defunct Kingpin Records. The album itself has a really unique ska/punk sound that is all it's own. While the band itself didn't last long the bands front man Jamie Woolford went on to front The Stereo and Let Go.
5,absolutely charming,"This book has gorgeous illustrations and a story that offers a unique, refreshing take on a traditional myth. There's nothing overbearing or preachy about it--it's basically true to the Biblical myth and also quite progressive in its portrayal of the creator, yet neither aspect is off-putting in any way. I found it at work (elementary school library) and read it on my own because the artwork is so wonderful I just couldn't resist (I'm sure its intended audience would love it as well)."
5,The Goddess is Alive!,"This book is a goddess send. It is fun, and it is joyful and it is just wonderful for me to have a strong, positive woman creator to show to my daughter who is 3.5. She loves it."
4,Fear Hall: The Conclusion,"Though, this book isn't as good as the first part, it's still a good read.In the conclusion Hope and her ""friends"" are forced out of Fear hall and into a abandon house where ""they"" are hiding out. In the process, Hope meets a new guy,Chris who isn't very interesting in my opinion, and ""Darryl"" still can't stop killing. It ended really sad, but I wish R.L. Stine had of written it that Hope went to a mental hospital or something like that. I mean he got the readers to love Hope in the first book and in this one make everything seem like her fault, although it really wasn't since she didn't know what she was doing. The issue of Muliple Personality Disorder, was obviously not researched very well by the author. If you want a more mature and more researched book about MPD I highly recommend ""Tell Me Your Dreams"" by Sidney Sheldon, it's kinda like this one but it's for more mature readers."
2,Too few pages by Campbell--THIS IS NOT A CAMPBELL BOOK!,"Joseph Campbell's entire contribution to this piece consists of a few pages at the beginning--basically, Campbell seems to have written an intro to Roberts' book, and Roberts decided to gravytrain on the Power of Myth phenomenon by adding Campbell's name to the author list.The book that Roberts wrote is a moderately interesting examination of the Waite-Rider arcana through a Jungian lens, but I was so ticked off that I'd been sold a book that perported to be by Campbell and yet had finished the portion written by Campbell in about fifteen minutes that I didn't get much out of it. My problem, I know, but the bait-and-switch thing REALLY bothered me!"
3,Designed for advanced studies,"This is mostly a book by Roberts about the Waite deck, but there is also a little gem written by Joseph Campbell using the Marsailles deck to illustrate some of his concepts and Jungian perspectives. Campbell's analysis will appeal to most everyone, while Roberts discourse is clearly for advanced students. The problem with both sections is that the illustrations are few and far in between, and often so small that the details being discussed cannot be viewed. This is a major flaw in a book like this."
4,Advanced Symbology,"An excellent treatise on the symbology of the Tarot - both the Marsailles deck (by Joseph Campbell) and the Waite deck (by Richard Roberts).Echoing some of the other reviews - the material is very dense. It is an excellent work, but not for the beginner. A good foundation in Jung and Campbell will go a long way to helping to digest the concepts. Also, Joseph Campbell's contributions are pretty limited. If you are looking for pure Joe Campbell, this is going to disappoint.The detailed analysis of the symbols of the Waite Tarot opened new vistas that I had not seen before. While Roberts himself admits that the analysis is somewhat subjective and specualtive, he ties the material back to Jung and others with an adroit style, and there is little in the way of pure speculation.A good read for the advanced student of Jung and Campbell - not so good for the novice."
4,unique perspective,a uniquely elegant and informative look inside the world of Tarot by a powerful collaboration indeed.Tarot from a Jungian and mythological perspective is what you will get with this highly interesting work.
5,That's ok,"I want a mesh strainer for coffee, and it is just the object that I wished.That is stainless steel too !"
2,Maria Checa Saves These Video,"Overall these video is a total zero, but I would still buy it even after I had seen it. Why? Maria Checa. She has to be one of the most beautiful, sexy, women ever. For Playboy or anyone else. The way she flirts with the camera will melt your heart. The way she moves her body will make you drule. And the way she smiles at you just makes you want to move to and live in Cancun forever not just for spring break.Buy these video, fast forward it to Maria Checa and find out why men fall in love."
4,Melancholic sounds,"October Tide was a side project of two members of Katatonia. Their first album, ""Rain Without End"" was brilliant. Dark, depressing and gloomy. Then ""Grey Dawn"" came out and though it does not surpass the debut, this album has amazing music. The voice is a dark growl, but not an agressive one like say Cannibal Corpse, but its more of a sad, heartfelt wail. The guitars are slow, and everytime the sound comes out of the speakers, it gets dark, cold and gloomy. If you like anything from the Cure, to Candlemass, you will enjoy this album, but good luck trying to get this one or ""Rain without End"" its almost impossible. Please, guys from Katatonia, if you ever read this, can you please make another album? I have never heard anything like October Tide..dont let it die."
3,katatonia side project,"i like it but it is hardly as good as katatonia can produce..a couple good tunes is about all it has to offer...if your into keeping up w/ the doom scene or whatever label it is under right now it is better than most of the stuff i have come across.as should anything attatched to the members of katatonia...this among katatonia cd's if it keeps them employed its worth it....""avantgarde"" label be glad to find it here"
4,Alaska is not an island?,"This cd was way better than I expected. I have always kind of liked Christian on Best Week Ever and I got this cd very cheap so I decided to give it a whirl. The material is pretty darn good even if his delivery is nothing special. I laughed pretty hard at several points throughout this album especially during the part about Alaska and the whole bit about crummy music. Totally hilarious. It will have a stupid song stuck in your head for weeks afterwards. Take a listen, it's worth it."
1,STOP!! DON'T BUY!!,"I was sincerely disappointed. This scale will give you different weights depending on I don't know what. Sort of magic but no good. Furthermore, it sometimes won't let you weigh more than 2 lbs. Go and figure why they sell this stuff..."
1,You get what you pay for,"This scale is completely inaccurate. I compared it with an older spring-type scale, and it was always off by more than a few ounces. The dial with the weights on it spins way too easily, making it almost impossible to NOT move it after you set the thing to zero."
5,10 out of 5 stars,"Of course people don't believe Anna. Nobody wants to believe that this stuff can happen.But it does.Anna's story helped me to write my story down, and i'm sure it's helped alot of people in the same situation.She told the horrible, Ugly truth, that nobody wants to believe. She made a difference in this world by writing a wonderful book. THe ending wasn't weak, the ending showed her transtion from Tiffany to Anna, the amount of courage shown in this book was amazing. Anna J Michner is a name we will be seeing years from now."
5,Anna Tells The Truth and Bares Her Heart!!!,"This is one of the most raw, heart breaking, engrossing stories I have ever read.I cried alot during this reading.From personal experience I know what Anna says to be true. There is alot of corruption involved where there is money to be made in the mental health system. Children have no rights against abuse and cruelty of uncompassniate, emotionless, souless, adults who often times work in the mental estabilishments. Alot of people don't want to believe things like this happen but they do. Anna writes from her heart and you get a feeling of intimacy, as if she is reading right to you , she pours her soul out on every page. Her description of the doctors and staff workers are humorous and hard but accurate. Anna speaks for all the young victims who don't have a voice, or who are too traumatized from abuse to write a book.THANK YOU ANNA, and I wish you lots of happiness and success in the future!!"
5,abuse is real and alive,this book is so powerful because she pretty much tells it exactly as it is. every word in her book is true. abused people do not fit in with society and never will because you can't even begin to understand unless it has happened to you. even if you survive it you still are an outcast. i cried through the entire book. to be able to write something that powerful at age sixteen? i recomend that abused people read this book so that they know tat they are not alone or crazy and i recomend that people who haven't been abused read this book so they can see that it is real and maybe rethink their attitude towards this very serious subject. read it and learn from it.
2,"How does Anna Michener ""become"" Anna?","i have to say that i was disappointed with this book. anna's story at times reads like a laundry list of all of the patients she encounted while in various institutions. it is repetitive and painful to keep reading the accounts of how she and other patients were treated. perhaps i was expecting something different, but i thought this book would focus more on how anna's life changed after her hospitalizations and as she began her life with her new family. i do not believe that anna has accounted for many of the complexities that her new life has inevitably brought, and how she has been affected by this. indeed, i do not really see how she ""becomes"" anna; i think there tries to be too much of a happy ending to this sad story."
4,The Next Big Thing,"Clear Static are The Next Big Thing. Take my word for it. I saw Duran Duran in 1981 and knew they were TNBT a year before MTV figured it out. Clear Static will be stars on that level. Their live shows are Notorious for make up overdoses and the girls crowd in like feeding vampires to try and suck up the energy from the band.The album contains many strong tracks in the New Wave Revivalist mode of The Killers, The Bravery, The Modern, Click Five, Interpol, etc. Star tracks include ""97 Lies"", ""Tuesday On My Mind"", ""Make Up Sex"", ""Living Like The Movies"" (my personal fave), ""Dancing with Strangers"", and ""Careless Lies"". Through all of these and more CS makes it clear they have the chops to be Glam Pop sensations. In my opinion, you won't regret a minute of the time you spend listening to Clear Static."
5,BUY IT,this ablum is so amazing..every track has its own flare to it.it is well worth the money...if you dont believe..then go to their myspace and listen for yourself..truly breathtaking
5,Powerful book on Runes,This book is one you won't want to put down. It is set up for a class guidebook for Runes. The powerful message eminates from this book. I would highly recommend it.
1,Worthless,"The runes were an alphabet. The only mystical thing about them is their having been demonized by Christians in an attempt to stamp out a rival religion. If you are into tarot cards and the like, this book is for you. If you have an actual interest in Asatru or Heathen beliefs then save your money (and your time) there are better books to be had and better sources of information --which one could barely call this book while maintaining a straight face--that can be found (in some cases for free) by looking around."
4,Interesting additions of information in this book,"I was pleasantly surprised to find examples of how to combine runes to get a powerful punch to your magic work. Page 94 has examples of combined binding runes for spiritual power, gift of joy, protection for luggage or mail, protect computer, etc. I enjoy books that can add to your current life needs."
2,Not so good,I like how Voltio sings but the CD is full of dumb songs i have to say i realy dont like it.
1,An addictionist-psychiatrist looked at your article,This article reviews his opinion and disagreement with the use of naltrexone and methadone discussed in a meeting he attended. The article is useless. You can get more information from the evening news. Do not waste your time or money.
4,Great Bag,This is a great bag however the color shown in the photo is not the actual color - it is actually a pastel pink not bright pink.
5,WONDERFUL TOTE!,"I bought 7 of these bags. One for my self and 6 for my brides maids. I am filling them with flip flops, lotion, hair accessories, etc... stuff for the wedding day they may need. They are large enough to fit a ton of stuff and they are very durable. I am so glad I ordered one for my self. The open up nicely and fit perfectly on your shoulder. I would highly recommend them for any type of tote bag use especially a beach tote."
5,Great deal!,"The bags are great! AWESOME price too! The material is a little stiff, but for the price, I can deal!"
5,"Nice bags, quick shipping",The bags were great. They were the perfect size and a great value for the price. I bought 8 and they came in within 3 days.
5,GREAT PURCHASE,"I purchased the pink and white bags for my bridesmaids, and they have turned out to be a great idea! i have been looking around and price matching for a long time and these bags are a great deal. they are a good size to fit just about anything in, and i ironed on rinestones that say bridesmaid to personalize them. i am very happy with the purchase!"
4,"Fascinating, but Basic","Dr. Hare's manifesto helps the casual user observe and deal with the psychopaths that roam the streets. A great read for many who recently found the immensely popular ""The Psychopath Test,"" and for anyone who is generally interested in the debate between psychopathy and sociopathy, and the ""treatments"" of both ailments. Though repetitive, the anecdotal evidence supports the data nicely and maintains the pace of the read.Simultaneously a manual for the newly initiated and a mild poke at the DSM, ""Without Conscience"" is a quick and fascinating read."
4,Psychopaths Among Us,"Written by the person who developed the standard checklist for diagnosing someone as a Psychopath, this book is very interesting and informative. You will almost certainly be surprised at the prevalence of psychopathic individuals, and the clear danger they are to us as individuals and as a society."
4,Good Insight,This book gives a good insight to the mind of a psychopath. My favorite parts of the book was a look at the different cases of Dr. Hare.
5,Unmasking The Psychopath,"This book is extremely helpful and useful, especially if you've had an encounter with a psychopath but were not aware of it at the time. The neighbor who lives behind me is clearly a psychopath and this book helped me to deal with her bizarre antics and most unusual behavior. It answered so many questions I can't thank the author enough. I've learned so much about this subject, I wish everyone would read this book and learn the things they should know before they have a devastating experience of their own."
5,Normal Folks ...Watch Out...They are out there.,For Anyone of us who have ever said to yourself...that person is truly odd and just different...To those of us who consider ourselves just average but know that there are those other folks among us...To the woman who continues in a relation ship just for the sake of a companion....THIS BOOK IS CALLING YOU... Please read this one...it tells of the true nature of people you know...people we all know.I knew this person for over 15 years and always knew something was wrong and after reading the characters in this book....that person is a 100% PSYCHOPATH. He passed the clinical test with a score of 40. I NEVER knew the words to explain him to my friends or myself. I could never find the words to describe the character he presented to me. Now I have all the exact words....It is crystal clear to me and No he is no longer in my life. Turns out he is a Sexual Predator and is a PORN KING...OUCH!
4,Refreshingly free of hyperbole and generalization,"Too many books on sociopaths are written in such a way that they lead you to believe that anyone you don't like (primarily bosses, coworkers and your ex (s)) could be described as one. Dr. Hare, one of the world's leading experts on antisocial behavior has written a short, concise and informative book on what a sociopath is and, just as important, what they are not. It's not enough to say ""mean people are bad...and EVIL!"" Dr. Hare takes the important step of distinguishing the ordinary bad things that people do to each other out of ignorance and thoughtlessness from the mindful, directed, calculating predatory qualities that distinguish the true sociopath. It would be nice if the book gave more of a survey of the field beyond his own research, but you can't blame the guy since he's actually done so much good research himself. This is probably the best non-academic book on the topic you can buy."
5,Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us.,Very interesting. Reading it as a selection in a book group I belong to.
1,Not well written.,"With this book, with every new page I felt tempted to just place it in the garbage and forget about it.The writer is, obviously, a very respected person in the field of psycopathy, but he has no idea about how to write a book. It is a shame, really. It was a waste of my time and my money."
2,Not nearly as well researched as other reference materials,"I am very disappointed with this book, parts of appear to be lifted in toto from Dr. Martha Stout's excellent ""The Sociopath Next Door"" without attribution.Save the money and just buy Dr. Stout's book...it is far better researched and is far superior to this effort."
4,Great Book,"A great book. Really helped me through a difficult time in my life. If this book is read in conjunction with Morton Bain's Psychopath!, a degree of perspective and understanding is achieved that can really help deal with these very difficult people. I would recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who has had this misfortune of dealing with psychopaths, sociopaths and extreme narcissists."
3,Mildly informative .,"Better than Snakes in Suits, although perhaps i was expecting something little more clinical, including more case histories.also not Hervey Cleckley"
4,Great Overall,I ordered this book and got it the mail within 2-3 days. It was fast and excellent customer service and i love it because it is brand new and i am learning a lot from it. Great purchase.
4,Without Conscience,The book is very informative. It helps you to deal with the reality that there are just some bad people out there who enjoy being that way. The book helps you to identify them and then you must make the choice to keep your distance from them. I thought the book was easy to read and plan to read it again in a few years as a reminder.
5,PAGE TURNER,"It's not a question of WHO I know to be a psychopath, but HOW MANY I know.This book explains everything about a person I'm dealing with. I'm hoping that many people will understand me better and see that I'M NOT the one at fault. Thank you, Dr. Hare"
2,Too anecdotal,"This book tells too many anecdotes, as if to appeal to an audience in search of gossip. I found it tedious to have the discussion interrupted with so many stories."
2,Psychopathy and Substance Abuse Link,"This was an okay primer on the subject of psychopathy, but I would have liked to have seen more on the link between this disorder and substance abuse. Approximately 75% of all psychopaths have a history of substance abuse (alcohol in particular) and failure to mention this fact would be nothing less than a glaring omission. A list of traits is presented, but I felt that substance abuse, a behavioural trait with a strong correlation, should have been elaborated on. The author does stress that a cluster of traits must be present (not just one or two) and wisely cautions that diagnosis should be done by a trained professional."
4,Psychopaths in society,"Aside from personal harms that can result from psychopaths, this book gives a timely, and chilling, warning that all is not well in our highly politicized capitalistic society whose leaders may include a sprinkling of the (not yet criminalized) psychopaths. Regrettably, the author was skimpy on the formal guideline for isolating such largely incurable sociopathic persons. The fact that corporations have most of the attributes of psychopaths seems to dovetail alarmingly well with the recent Supreme Court decision granting personhood to corporations only deepens our predicament."
3,Review,"The book is ok....it explains things, but just not quite what I was expecting to read. Guess I was hoping for more."
3,Next Door?,"This book give a ghoulish view of psychopaths also called sociopaths.A more realistic view point will help you recognize them, when they come into your life. For this reason I recommend the 'Sociopath Next Door'.They are 4% of the population, and you might encounter them and not realize it. When you include all personality disorders you have a much larger population."
5,A warning to all,"I found this book's subject matter absolutely fascinating. The author presents the subject of psychopathy in layman's terms so those of us without a Ph.D. in Psychology can easily follow. He comes across as the expert that he is, with decades of hands-on experience working with psychopaths and doing research into the disorder. While the subject matter is chilling, it's a necessary read for those who've been in contact with someone who fits the description. Although the book is a little repetitive (in terms of the descriptions of the personality traits and typical behaviors), the repetition was probably better left in to truly get across the sheer destructive nature of this personality disorder on people individually and society as a whole. Excellent book. Even though I bought it for research purposes (I'm a novelist), I'm glad I read it for my own edification. I highly recommend this book."
2,Superficial Literature,"""Without Conscience"" by Robert D. Hare is disappointing.Despite the fact the rear cover makes reference to theauthor's life time achievement award in 2005 none of thesources cited for the book are more recent than 1994.While psychopaths are elusive, in 2009 one must suspectthat additional insights have been gained on the topic,especially if the author is as authoritative as publishersuggests.Additionally, all the conclusions and insightspresented are based on case studies and movies.This made the conclusions Hare drew feel decidedlyunscientificFor the above reasons, it is difficult for me to recommend""Without Conscience"" as much more than a superficialpresentation by a well regarded scholar."
2,Poor treatment of a fascinating topic,"Very interesting raw material, but poorly handled. What should have been a real page turner - who isn't curious about the extreme criminal mind?! - instead is a hard slog to get through. Pity.A good editor, or perhaps a professional co-writer, could have made all the difference."
3,Good value but won't last forever,"After about two dozen uses, the handle is showing signs of fatigue. The contact point where the handle mates with the top of the ice shaver is wearing down. Perhaps I am applying too much pressure? Well, it seems you have to if you want to shave the ice faster. For those who use a more gentle touch, this may not be a problem.Other than that criticism, I must say we have been enjoying this for making ""slushies"" and ice coffee. If you add a teaspoon of sugar to the water before freezing, it makes shaving the ice much easier."
5,Easy to Use,Even though I've never used it my 9 year old makes sno-cones for his family and friends and boast that the machine is much better than the ice shaver his friend has.
2,Plastic Handle failure,"After a few dozen uses, the handle finally broke off. We were quite disappointed at this, as we were enjoying its use up until the time it breaks. I noticed that another product ""hawaiice"" makes a hand-cranked ice shaver that is made of metal, but I do not see it for sale here."
3,They're ok! Pilot could've made them better!,Good but not great! I think they could have done a tad better job. They not as smooth or vivid as I would've wanted.
1,Monotony revisited.,"In the next to last paragraph Dr. Feinberg writes ""...I'll soon forget these monotonous months. They'll telescope into one grey blur, and the days will run into each other, in retrospect, with only a few high spots standing clear."" There are no high spots, just one monotonous blur. A total waste of time."
3,Qualitative not Quantitative,The book outlines - over the course of about 50 pages - a simple and qualitative risk metric. IF one is looking for a method to quantify risk then look elsewhere; perhaps to a professional actuary.Overall it is a decent book for an introduction to qualitative risk analysis.
3,Knitted Afghans vs. Crochet Afghans,"I would order every book if I only knew how many were crocheted and how many were knitted patterns. I do both, however, I really need more knitted afghan patterns. Usually when I order these books, 90% are crochet.Could you please specify how many of each are in the book?A very big thank youBrenda"
2,not what i thought,"Its not necassarily bad, but its not what i thought at all. I actually think i watched it on animal planet. its like a lot of random different people talking about their experiences with pets and other animal experiences. I was looking for a factual documentary, this is not what i wanted at all. Probably good for kids 10-14 interested in animals."
4,A great lady wants us to accept creatures as brothers,"Goodall wants us to see our own roots in our fellow creatures, accept ourselves as different only by degree. She would have us honor our ancestry all the way back. Accept animal emotion and suddenly you have deep roots and an honest, unforced place in the scheme of life. Conquest and submission are only a petty portion of our inheritance. Shared care, all the way to love, is our natural path to growth"
5,WARNING!: THE CONTENT OF THIS CD IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!,"This album is amazing. All 13 tracks make you want to get upfling yourself wildly around the room. These guys are tight. Thevocals cut through your mind like an electric current. Their musical talent is phenomenal. Serious musicians. Their live performance got me hooked. The test of true talent, the Pondering sounds as great live as in the studio. No tricks here. What you see is what you get and you'll be looking for more. ( ) The Pondering is an addiction you won't seek help for. END"
5,"life time experience - depth, musicality and interpretation","One of the great interpretoers of Verdi - so musical - not rushed - great success in ""cleaning"" the sound."
2,Coin pocket or not?,The Black pictures does NOT have any Coin Pocket.But the Cognac pictures does.What's up with that?
5,A wonderful Book,"Snowfall is by far one of the best books I've ever read. The style of writing is wonderful, and the plot is awesome. Charlotte is a amazing charactor who really stays interesting throughout the whole book. Definitly adventurious and romantic, this book is totally captivating. IT IS THE GREATEST!"
5,great,"This book is what got me into reading. The first time I read it, it took me three months because i was a bad reader but the second time i read it a couple months later it took me three days. So this book really changed my life. The end left me depressed so i had to rewrite it in my mind. great book!"
2,Eh...,"I'm usually a fan of historical fiction but I just wasn't a huge fan of the time period and how the story was written. It seemed like there were so many characters and not that much happened. I even stopped reading it halfway through, which I usually don't do, because I found myself bored with the plot. I'd recommend it if you are interested in the Victorian era, but otherwise, I think there are better novels out there."
4,A great book for any fan of historical novels!,"Snowfall by K.M. Peyton - one of her most recent books - is without doubt one of her best. It tells the story of young Charlotte Campion, age 16, a girl born in a Victorian age with a modern heart. Charlotte flees from marriage to the boring man her family favors and goes mountain climbing with her brother and his free thinking friends. What happens next will be familiar to any reader of Peyton's novels - Charlotte falls in love with three very different men - and then has to work out which of them she really wants. This is an intriguing novel full of tidbits about Victorian society and the art of mountain climbing. Strongly reccomended!"
4,bad ending,"During part one in this book i was completeley captured!It seemed to be all i ever thought about and i kept wanting to read more, however not wanting it to end. When i finaly got to part 2 and read the ending i was crushed! This is the type of book where u completley love it, and then read the ending and it ruins the book for you. However i would reccomend Blind Beuaty, an wonderful novel also by K.M peyton."
5,Perfect,"I got this bok the second time i looked at it. From the start i was CAPTIVATED. This book is so interesting, and incredibly sad. im not a person to cry over a book, but this book hit my heart. Everytime theres a snow accident i think of Milo, from the book, and it makes me incredibly sad. But it doesnt matter becasue the book is so well written. I REALLY recomend it. Im goign to buy it when i have enough money. i only wish it didnt end the way it did..."
5,"now sitting on my ""favorites"" shelf","i grabbed this book, desperate to get at least one thig before i left barnes & noble (sorry amazon!) and was pleasantly surprised by how much i loved it. historical fiction romances are right up my ally, but you must always be careful--there are some bed apples out there. Snowfall is not one of these. I was at first a little confused/put off by the fast pace of the book, but i soon got into the story because of it. it takes place of the course of about 2 years and must move this way. I really got to know the personalities of the characters, and was quite emotional with them. Even in the last chapter or two of the story, i could not tell how it was going to end, and was engaged until the very end. Thanks very much for a great read! i heartily reccomend this book.p.s. it left me crying! the mark of a great book."
5,surprising .....,"i have read hundreds, if not more, books in my life. And never has my heart been broken by a book. until this one. It was perfect and intense and despite what professional ""reviewers"" say - wonderful. Everyone should read this book. It is worth every minute of heartbreak."
2,Not Enough English,This DVD will not teach your child much. It has about 5-10 mins of each lang. listed on the dvd case. My daugther will watch the english part then she pays the rest no attention.
1,uggg! hate baby einstein,I have given baby einstein several tries and these dvds are just not good. This is last one I am purhcasing. Like for this one again why is everything almost in every other language yet only a few things in english. I would like it if my 7 month old was exposed more to english first since he cant talk yet versus 10 other languages.
5,Great - even for a younger age,Our 3 month old loves this video. It states that it's 6+ months but she still enjoys watching and making noises - it really makes her coo.
4,"My son loves this DVD, however my own views are different","My sons LOVES LOVES the puppets and when they makes the 'sounds' in this video. He gets a big kick out of hearing the monkeys go 'E-e-e-e' for the 'E' sound, and the sheep going 'baa' for the 'B' sounds. He giggles throughout this video.My pet peeves with it though- My son has learned NO sounds by watching this video, even with me trying to reinforce the sounds.- Mix of languages. Spanish, French, English and I think Mandarin (not sure though).- The stories are cute, but after watching this DVD atleast 40 times, I still don't understand what is being said (as the stories are in French, Spanish, etc) except knowing the story is either Little Miss Muffet, Little Bo Peep...Don't expect you child to pick up on any words from watching this. The puppets and the sounds are absolutely cute though. My son has picked up words like 'Hi' and 'Cat' from us actually READING a book to him and pointing at the pictures."
1,Do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I gave it 1 star for the images and NOT the first sounds sound... images are good but the DVD is NOT what you believe it to be. I took it out of the dvd several times thinking maybe I bought the wrong language...then i thought ..maybe i will change it to english settings...no luck so I sat it through and then they started speaking some english.I thought this dvd was teaching first sounds in english BUT this is not the case. I believe first sounds sound be the foundation to language and should be in 1 language, his native language.I love the baby einstein collection and so does my 8 month old BUT we differ on this dvd... he likes it cause he loves the characters and I like the characters too but I don't like the different language aspect.If you don't mind the 4 languages then it'll be a great buy."
1,No Value,I don't see the educational value in this product. They speak in single word sentences v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y. I don't know how to describe it other than weird. It is the second Baby Einstein dvd we've received as a gift and I feel bad that we won't use it. Show your baby Sesame Street. That would be much better than this.
1,Disappointed,"We have a large collection of Baby Einstein DVD's and like most of them. This one, however, was a HUGE disappointment.- It barely focus on making sounds- It has too many languages -- confusing for adults, and most likely confusing for children as well- The lady speaking the Spanish words seems to have a lisp or something weird -- it's not even clear!- My kids that normally LOVE Baby Einstein DVD's were bored with this and paid no attention to itIt is NOT at all what it claims to be in its description. Save your money."
1,Should have read the Amazon feedback,"I really wish I had read the negative feedback on Amazon before purchasing this. I picked it up at Target one day - what a mistake. My daughter is not interested in it, and I hate that it spends so much time on foreign languages. This is the worst DVD I have purchased for her."
2,Least Favorite Baby Einstein Video,"I have had excellent experiences with Baby Einstein DVDs but this one is disappointing. I usually cannot pull my daughter away from them however she refuses to watch this one. I don't know if it is just because it is so slow or because of the various languages, but I don't recommend this one at all. Try other Baby Einstein videos because they are usually excellent."
3,Uneven,"First two stories are totally uninteresting, but the others have some funny moments. Of course, one should keep in mind that these are urban legends, some of the things portrayed are simply taken from jokes and anecdotes circulating at the time. As far as documenting life in Romania, it does as good a job as `Borat` did for Kazakhstan."
3,How About Something Original For A Change?,"I like this author, but with the exception of Pearl Moon - her best work so far - nearly all her books are the same. The same premise, the same plot, the same amount of couples paired off, even the same NAMES for the characters!!! This wasn't a bad book, just the same old, same old. If you've read one, there's hardly a need to read the others."
1,My first and last Katherine Stone,"Loose, contrived plot. Awful character development. I was glad, however, to find out she was a doctor -- as it explained the mind numbing medical detail.I picked this up because it said she was a best seller. I at least expected something as readable as Grisham or Sheldon -- and I was disappointed. I'll certainly avoid all books by this author."
2,Farfetched!,"This is not the first book I've read by Katherine Stone, but it will be hard to want to buy another one. The story had too many subplots and the twin sisters' relationship developed far too fast to be plausible. This should have been saved for a magazine novella. Katherine Stone can do better than this!"
1,Not very good book,"I agree with Michelle Bruvoid's review--every word she said. I was disappointed with the book and doubt I'll buy another one of Katherine Stone's books. The italic thoughts were very confusing. Story line was good, just very poorly written."
1,Can't Rate It Any Lower,"Since I am intrigued by twins, I thought this might be a fun read. It stank - big time. The characters were never developed beyond names on the page and brief physical descriptions. In fact, it was so bad that I flipped to the last few chapters just to see what happened and found an ending that could have been taken directly from a soap opera (and not a well-written one). This will be my last Katherine Stone book."
3,"informative, but dry","This book is informative. As far as Atkins books go, it is kind of a dry read, though. There is still a lot of good information and patient case histories."
1,Sent the wrong book.,"We ordered this book and was mailed the incorrect book. It was needed for a class and now because of the failure of this dealer, I am loosing valuable points in the class."
4,Writing,Very good writing pen here. It arrived in the packaging as described and worked right out of the package. I would purchase this item again.
5,Received the pen very quickly.,The pen was shipped very quickly. I have used Dr. Grip refills in another pen that I have so I knew I would love using this comfort grip pen.
5,Awesome pen,"I am currently a college student and I take loads of math classes. I use this for everyone of them because regular pens just don't cut it. The only problem is when I bought some replacement black ink the tip of those ink weren't good, so every time I need a new ink I remove the tip of it and replace it with the original one."
2,Too Thin,Too thin to do me any good. Found others about 3 X as thick which are better. Google FAT PENS.
2,Waste of Time and Money,"Interested in the sailing lifestyle? Skip this book. Looking for a trashy romance novel? This may be the one. Written like an 8th grade girl's diary (a whiny one)with a weird beginning and then a flashback approach. A woman cheats on her husband (and daughters) with a married man( who also has children)....eventually marries this man because of a ""vision"". Their Florida real estate company makes TONS of money and she complains about paying child support and alimony. The real estate company collapses under mysterious circumstances(sound familiar)....they steal their boat after is has been seized and sail off to the Bahamas to hide out. They somehow survive with no visible sources of income. They completely drop contact with most of the children...the two teenage girls who come to visit are allowed to 'co habit' with boys on various islands.It was great bed time reading."
2,Not realistic prices,"Heres an example. Go on sites such as gunbroker or any other online firearms sales site and compare prices.HAMMERLI .22cal listed in the hundreds of dollars are fetching still over $1,000 in good condition. Ruger NM super blackhawks same thing the prices listed for .44 cal,.41,.45 cal are not accurate.Taurus revolvers are pretty spot on but derringers for $40 etc, is unreasonable unless the gun traders guide puts an note that prices are for private party and or pawn shops. Gun shows,gun shops and online sales are no wheres close to the low prices listed in this book. Remember alot has happened in the media and im sure that has raised prices as well but other thanusing the pictures as a reference, this book is nothing but bathroom reading material.Walmart has it new for $22 and i would save your money and go online to gunsamerica or gunbroker and just see what a specific fire arm is selling for to judge where the price should be realistically.Good luck"
5,Great Sugar Free Candy,"The is product was great and I will purchase the product again in the future. Even after there was an issue with the delivery process, I would still purchase the product"
1,Awful,"This was the worst low budget play I wish I hadn't purchase. The singing and acting was awful, don't waste your money."
2,LOVER OF PLAYS,"THIS IS NOT AN UPTODATE PLAY. ALTHOUGH A STAGE PLAY IT DOES NOT RANK HIGH ON PERFORMANCE OR STORY LINE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING IT, MAYBE JUST BORROWING IT WHEN YOUR REALLY REALLY BORED....AND HAVE WATCHED ALL OF THE PLAYS YOU HAVE IN YOUR PERSONAL LIBRARY SO MANY TIME YOU KNOW ALL THE LINES"
1,worthless,this is the worst play i have seen the picture quailty is way to dark the play itself was not worth the money i paid for. this play belongs in the dollar store
3,Confused,"I did like this book, as I liked the others in the series; however, I am a bit confused. The authors seem to join Mary (Miryam)of Magdala with Mary (Miryam), sister of Martha, to make one character. The Bible has quite a bit of info on Mary Magdalene, but less on Mary of Bethany, who was the sister of Martha and Lazarus. I realize that this book is fiction, but I was disappointed that I could never figure out which ""Mary"" they were referring to."
1,I didnt break out with laughter... I broke out with tears!!!,"This was the dumbest book, it was odd and ugala. The people wore the nastiest clothes."
4,Great DVD holders for cheap,"Love the colors, love the snap shut. Work great for protecting DVD's and CDs for shipping and general storage. Would buy again."
2,Not a good one,Packing is VERY Bad.. When I got the item the plastic wrap around the ClamShells is broken...Clam Shells are just Ok.. Not that great..They do not completely seal your CD/DVD.. there would be a little opening..
2,Not very secure,"These slim jewel cases are actually not as streamlined as another I've bought from Staples. Also, does not snap shut nor does disc fit securely to center snap as that is noticeably small."
1,Don't waste your money!,"You can't tell from the picture but these are incredibly flimsy. Once closed, by pressing on the ""center"" of the plastic case, they easily re-open with the slightest movement. They bend very easily. Turns out they're several millimeters thinner than your typical case.Terrible. Would not recommend. Not worth it."
2,Maxell CD-355 Clam-Shell Cases,"I do not like these. They do not snap closed, therefore, they do not work well to hold the CD in. They are ok as long as you just want to put them on a CD rack or in the car, but you must hold on to it when you pick it up or the CD will fall right out. I had some clam-shell cases before that were great. Don't know if I just got a bad batch."
4,sturdy; good buy,I was looking for inexpensive buy sturdy jewel case covers and found these. worth the money and the colors are fine
2,Espresso? - HOW?,Seems to only make (good) coffee - does anyone know how to get espresso from this?4 cups also - it's not 4 american cups (8 oz) this is misleading - it can hold about 12 or so ounces. That's about 1.5 cups.
3,Product not as expected,"Purchased the item considering that the Bialletti is a good brand. This product was made in India and I felt the quality wasn't up to par. I returned the product because it arrived damaged, but I am not sure if I would purchase it again. Ok, but not great."
5,"Best Espresso @ Home, Lasts FOREVER","I purchased this moka pot from Amazon in 2007. Here it is, 5 years later, and it still looks and works beautifully. I have used it nearly every single day, sometimes multiple times per day. Just this week, I noticed that the rubber gasket is getting worn and needs replaced. Pretty good for 5 years of constant use! I first got hooked on coffee when I lived in Italy as a teen, and coming back to the U.S., I have tried several forms of brewing. Last year I even thought a pump-driven espresso machine would be better than my trusty old moka pot. Not so... I've used it for 6 months now, and I keep finding myself going back to my moka pot espresso.Yes, it takes a little time to get the hang of making coffee with a moka pot, but years later I look back and think of it as no big deal. After a week or so of use, you won't think twice about how to use it.The 6-cup model makes just enough for two large lattes or three regular sized lattes."
2,It doesn't make the best coffee,"I was looking for a stainless steel espresso percolator, because the aluminum Bialetti ones I've owned in the past would deteriorate over time.Although the aluminum would not last, they made some very good espresso with a thick creme on top. I've had over five years as a Barista at an 'Artisti de Gusto' illy cafe, so I know what it takes to make a good coffee. No matter the coarse of the grind this stainless steel perc just would not make a decent shot."
4,Very good but slightly thin for me.,I bought this stovetop because I didn't want machine to take up my kitchen space. The review was good and that I'm not really 'heavy drinker' so I got this relatively fine product in reasonable price. I think the performance of this product is good but I have a friend who has a machine which was about $70 and the espresso this one makes was a little bit thinner. So if you really want a strong espresso like coffee shops you should get other ones. However for me I just make coffee for lattes and mocas so I'm happy with this.
3,4 cup size too small,"The 6 cup was unavailable the day I ordered and I wish I would have waited because even with a bunch of steamed milk, there is really only about one tall coffee cup full. Which is fine for one person, but there are two of us and I always have to make another pot right away. I've used the cast aluminum ones and the stainless is much nicer by far."
3,Design Issues,"This espresso pot makes a great mug of coffee for me each morning but I prefer my old octagonal aluminum 6 cup Bialetti. The reason for the replacement are health concerns regarding the use of non-anodized aluminum cooking pots. My new pot looks great but it is difficult to remove the top section from the bottom. The old octagonal design of the aluminum pot allows for an easy grip when unscrewing the top, which much of necessity be secured tightly. It is likewise difficult secure the top to the bottom and takes more precision than I can provide early in the morning. I've had a few occasions when the top threads did not align with the bottom and the pot became stuck and only after having coffee grounds and water fly across the counter have I freed them."
1,no longer the quality it used to be,I've used Bialetti stovetop espresso percolators for over 30 years. This new one is made out of extremely thin steel and makes a very poor espresso. It now sits on the shelf doing nothing; a real waste of money.It says that it is made in India according to Bialetti's standards. It looks and feels like the same sort of Indian Tiffin wear that is used for carrying and storing food inIndia for over 50 years. Very cheap and very thin. From now on I will now do my shopping in a department store where I can see the quality of what I purchanse.
4,Working beautifully!,"I upgraded from my aluminum moka pot to this beautiful stainless steel model as a health precaution. The coffee from this one, however, is not near as good as the moka pot. Although they both work the same, there is a difference in how the water filters through the coffee as this model does not create the same rich flavor. Everything works perfectly and had I not had a moka pot previously, I would likely have been totally satisfied. UPDATE: I have been using this daily for over six months and now love it! The aluminum moka pot is just a memory. :-)"
3,"Quality Issues & made in India, not Italy","I received my Bialetti today, and while the Amazon description states the Bialetti Class 6 model is made in Italy, it is actually made in India. Also, the black knob on top of the lid is rough and bumpy, instead of being smooth.The side on the inside of the pot that I received has several big scratch marks, and the quality of construction (or in this case, lack thereof) is not what I'd expected for $40+. While the pot does work as advertised, I would not buy this item again, and am disappointed."
4,great coffee maker,"Great coffee maker.I also have an Espresso machine, but I changed it because there are too many plastic parts in the machine (plastic and hot water - I don't want the chemicals leaching into my coffee) I like to use the Bialetti everyday. It gives you great coffee. I use strong espresso coffee beans for a great flavor. And it made from stainless steel much better than the aluminum once."
3,"Works ok, but NOT made in Italy","Bialetti apparently contracts this item out to India and is marked on on the box with an add-on sticker. The unit works ok, but the workman ship is shoddy with filed welds showing and low quality plastic handles."
1,"Cheap, period.","If you're looking for a stainless steel moka pot, this is not the one. I had to return this product because it wouldn't produce a satisfiable amount of coffee. The seal between the top half and the bottom weren't aligned correctly which allowed steam pressure to leak out the sides.I've recently bought the Bialetti Musa (another stainless steel pot), and it works wonderfully."
1,Will barely make two 2oz cups!,"Ordered this with high hopes and opened it the minute we got it. Filled it with coffee, and lo and behold, will only make about 4 oz total of coffee. Tried a coarser grind and same result. Guess we'll have to stick with the Aeropress which is more reliable. Returning it right back to Amazon. Very disappointed.Updated on 1/29/2011: After this experience, I purchased the more highly rated 6 cup Aluminum version, and it works great. The 6 cup version uses about 30 grams of coffee to make (about) 12 oz, whereas the 4 cup version uses about 14 grams to make 8 oz. The higher coffee concentration seems to make a huge difference; I get flavor similar to the Aeropress (which uses about 45 g to make 8oz) while using less coffee; the Aeropress is still more convenient for making a sinlge 2 oz cup."
4,No metallic taste in my coffee,"I bought this percolator because I had aluminum ones before. The extra money is worth the better taste. I have a gas stove, and you have to be careful not to let the flames get too high or the bottom will discolor. I wasn't careful and the bottom has become brassy, but it appears only to be a cosmetic problem."
4,Better than many,"I have been using moka pots for 10 years. This one has been one of the better I've used. Any that have broken have done so by human error. In this instance, the top fell from the counter and hit in just the right way to pop off the lid. There are no screws connecting them, so I can't fix it without welding it back on. Without the lid, it still can be used however, so I'll take my time finding a new one."
2,made great coffe for a year and 3 months,"i've read other reviews that had trouble with this little coffee maker in terms of the handle falling off, the seal being bad or the lid faulty; mine was great from june 2010 until september 2011, everyday, one cup. in september, it began to leak from a difficult to diagnose area. the bottom had rotted out. i could put water in it and it would be fine, but under pressure everything would start hissing and spitting and i'd get less coffee than i should have.it has come to my attention that this item was made in india, not italy. it might work just fine for awhile, but i think ultimatley its just poorly made.AJpeace"
1,This particular model BURNS EVERY CUP,"Pros:- 4 shots is plenty for one and still enough for two.- Stainless steel suggests less chance of health risks.Cons:- BURNS EVERYTHING!!I love this style of espresso maker, but this particular model sucks!After more than a dozen attempts - it has yet to produce a single palatable shot. I've tried everything -- fine grind, coarse grind, commercial grinds; tight pack, loose pack; high water, low water -- everything!!My record of perfect espresso generation had been impeccable - until this cursed thing arrived."
2,poor manufacturing,"I purchased the six-cup Stainless Steel Bialetti Class stovetop moka maker. The top is slightly out-of-round and will not seal effectively when mated to the bottom so steam escapes at the interface point preventing the unit from generating enough pressure to pump the coffee through the interior normally. Using heavier gauge steel or better manufacturing tolerances would've prevented this. This may not be a problem with every unit; but, buyers should mate the unit in the store prior to purchase to ensure that the top and bottom mate and seal successfully."
3,Not for the uninitiated!,This book hops from completely outdated on-line and computer information (that is better left to more easily updated information media) to in-depth and poorly detailed and ill-defined investment-speak within the same paragraph. The formulas for evaluating stocks are outstanding but well-noted that they are to be used for evaluation only! I would have a much easier time recommending Robert Sheard's The Unemotional Investor or anything from the Gardner brothers for beginners or the partially acclimated participant in investing. A good effort but left many aspects lacking in my mind.
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would...,"This book is horrible. If you know nothing about investing at all, maybe it could help you. But it implies that it is a book about online investing and provides you almost NO information pertaining to on-line investing. If you want help doing stock research do a search for stock sites. You can find them easily using any of the search engines. Many investment magazines will reference useful sites as well.This book provided absolutely nothing worthwhile regarding on-line investing and just rehashed a number of ideas much better presented by their original authors (like William O'Neill's book).If you want this book I will give it away free. Just send mail to magicease@aol.com. You pay the shipping and I will mail it to you. If I don't hear from anyone, I will throw it away, total waste of printing materials."
1,Don't waste your money,"I am a computer programmer and I have read loads of book on the Market. Forget it do not buy it. Instead consider ""Secrets for profiting in Bull and Bear Markets"" or CANSLIM method by O'Neil."
1,Out of time,"Out of time, out of money, out of technology - an utterly complete waste of time! You get advice to better buy an Intel 486 PC(sic!) instead of lower numbers (!), an explanation of the Quick Ratio and a sample sessions of how to access financial information using (an outdated) internet service(!). Absolutely not up to the title and an offense to the serious modern investor. Rubbish! Nil Stars (not foreseen, sorry)"
2,king of guidebooks? Surely you jest!,"This is a very disappointing guide book. Supposedly the information in this 2003 edition is up-to-date, but I was finding information that is 3 to 4 years out of date. Hotel price ranges in particular are outdated.In addition to the outdated information, a big failure of this guide book is the lack of photos. There are no photos inside to make a person interested in visiting the country. Photos showing the bustling markets, beautiful beaches, historical temples make a person want to see those places in person much more than the dry text descriptions.One positive thing about the guide is information on excursions to Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Saves one from buying an entire guide on Cambodia just to learn about Angkor Wat.Recommend you skip this guide and go for either Rough Guide or Lonely Planet."
5,Good Pen,This is a good roller-ball pen. It has a 0.7 mm point which really makes about a medium width line. The body of the pen being the color of the ink is helpful. Service was prompt and the price was good.
2,Not what I remember.,"I thought these pens would be alot like the old school pilot pens I used to draw with back in the 90s. Lol. They are not. As a matter of fact, some of these pens are worthless right out of the box. I will not be buying these again."
4,Some pens die early but I love the writing style,"I'm a long time fan of this product, but like many commercial pens, a pack is bound to have some duds that don't last very long. In general these pens do not last very long....I'd say a week or two is the average (I use the pen throughout the day). I like pens that mimic a fountain pen's writing quality though. They're also good to use for sketching, so eventhough they're more expensive than your average pen and last less I'm willing to pay for it."
2,Pens,I've had these in blue for quite a while and do not like them. They do not hold up and look really bad after light use. This is not near as big of a problem as that they do not write evenly. The ink will stop flowing; this happens more often when writing on a hard surface like a desk. They do work better when writing in a notebook or something similar. I have uploaded a couple of pictures.
3,Decent,"The set I bought works for about five minutes then suddenly quits, so I pretty much have to switch back and forth between pens when they both stop putting out ink since shaking them up and down doesn't work. If you would like a pen that works great then suddenly stops working mid-sentence then this pen is for you, otherwise I suggest you look else where."
3,"Nice Pen, A lot of Ink, Bad Ink Flow","I bought this for me and my boyfriend. He took one and I took the rest. It's a nice, comfortable pen, but if you want a perfect thin line, you have to hold the pen in a specific position. If you do not, it gives you a sloppy line.Also, you cannot get that thin line using normal lined paper. It bleeds through and the line is thick. If you want that thin line, you have to use proper hard paper or printer paper. I guess I can't use it for school anymore."
3,The light didn't work!,The light didn't work! We put new batteries in and still it didn't work! This was a Christmas gift for my cousin. Luckly he is older.
3,What It Takes,"The book is interesting in parts, particularly when the author is writing in a humorous style. Overall it was a bit dull. I quit about 2/3 of the way through."
5,Detailed analysis of the nature of candidates and presidential politics,Insightful description of the characteristics of presidential candidates from childhood until they became candidates; a must read for anyone wanting to understand what makes em run
4,A Book For Political Junkies,"This long book I'd recommend only for real political junkies. It's exhaustive in both senses of the term. Its great virtue is that it gives the reader a thoroughly comprehensive view of the jockeying for position leading to the choice of candidates for the 1988 Presidential campaign. As such, it's a valuable tool for understanding the inner workings of our political system. Richard Ben Cramer's use of language, however, can be irritating or downright offensive. He seems determined to sound informal/populist. This comes across as repetitive and actually forced at times. He also has the unfortunate habit of trying to match the crude, profane, and vulgar expressions his subject sometimes fall into. I react negatively to this. By all means, quote exactly what the politicians say, but there's no need to engage in such crudities yourself. Again, Cramer ends up sounding forced."
4,Well worth the thousand pages.,"This book has been called the gold standard of political journalism; it reports not just the campaigns but the early childhood experiences of the main candidates of the 1988 presidential race: George H.W. Bush, Michaael Dukakis, Gary Hart, Bob Dole, and Richard Gephardt: very very American stories. The drive and brilliance of all these men is unmistakable; particularly moving are the chapters about Dole's comeback from debilitating war wounds. The reporting is a bit Tom Wolfe/Hunter Thompson-ish that can devolve against itself as a sameness of tone rather than diversity of voices. Good good fun, though.The reader carries away the sad realization of how the electoral process has destroyed candidates. Even Bush the winner was destroyed in that he sank to scurrilous tactics to gain the prize."
5,A New Hampshire vote for Richard Ben Cramer!,"This book is very long, but not long enough--Cramer is that good, and that entertaining a writer. This book was not only insightful, but fun to read. How he managed to get into the lives of the candidates so intimately I will neve know, but it is our gain. It ably demonstrates the stamina and drive it takes to put yourself on the line to run for the most powerful office in the world. A great book and a great read."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was highly acclaimed by TV commentators last week after the author died. They said if you love politics you must read this book. I am not finished reading it and I'm not sure I will or if I do I'll skim. It follows the candidates for the presidential election in 1988 and it goes into GREAT detail about Bush the 1st and Dole - their backgrounds from children, etc. Now I've come to Gary Hart, who I had pretty much forgotten and don't really want to review. So I guess I'd have to say this book is too dated and overly detailed to hold my interest"
3,Too small print!,"Sent this to my son. He said the book is written great but over 1000 pages in very, very small print. My son doesn't wear glasses and has excellent eye sight. Was the publisher trying to save money? Maybe it should have been in two books!"
5,A true classic on presidential elections,"Ben Cramer follows the major candidates in their races to become president in 1988. He reproduces their speaking and thinking styles in such an incredible way that you will never be able to think of any of these people (Bob Dole, GHW Bush, Jesse Jackson) in quite the same way you did before.His intense focus on how the candidates act differently when in private than they do when they're out giving their stump speech makes for fascinating reading. If you're tired of dry books that are ""nothing but the facts, ma'am,"" you'll love this well-written story."
3,Presidential Primary,Enjoyed the first half of the book but the later part was too detailed and jumped from subject to subject. It was difficult to follow.
5,"The ""War and Peace"" of political campaign books","This is an amazing book for its portrayal of our gruelling presidential election process. Each of the men profiled here exhibits remarkable traits of perseverance and single mindedness, while also harboring the fatal flaw that will keep him from his final goal...or not. Even when you know the outcome of the 1988 race, Ben Cramer keeps you in suspense. How did the winner do it?This is a book for political junkies, of course, but it is also a book for anyone who loves a good story, pitch perfect dialogue, and believable human portraits. It's like reading a very vivid, very long, very complicated novel. It's the ""War and Peace"" of political campaign books only more fun."
5,The Best Book on the subject,"Do you crave behind the scenes presidential horse race bio's? A real feel for the candidates who put all of their lives & hubris on the line? This is the book that started &, likely, will finish any watcher or professional's list on this subject. A lovely, exhaustive read"
3,"Good book so far, but...","I'm somewhat of a political junkie, so this stuff is beautiful. However, having said that there also must be some reason why, only about 20% of the way in (a little over 200 of the 1000+ pages!), the book is starting to get some ""lonely"" time. This far in I'm just being introduced to Gary Hart. I'm all for character development, and in this case one could argue that it's more important than ever, but it needs to move on to more substance about the machinery, the process. I'll be finishing it for sure, but I can't give a book that I'm not glued to more than 3 stars."
2,What It Takes,"Unfortunately, this book has disappointed. After listening to a review on radio and discussion of the author and his recent death, I was interested in reading the book. I am not a fan of this style of writing; semi-factual and slight chip on the shoulder with the author being obviously superior to his subjects."
3,right wing,"I did not enjoy it too much about Dole and Bush, I stopped reading after that. I may go back toit at a later time."
4,Story of La Santa de Cabora / La Nina de Cabora,"Fascinating. Reads like fiction, although it is biographical. Well researched. Good picture of northwestern Mexico in the late 1800s, both politically and culturally."
2,Hans 4,"I agree with Zimmer. Way too much repitition. Poorly thought out. Two years later (1991)Greeley wrote "" The Search For Maggie Ward"", a romantic maserpiece. Guess he learned a lot, in two years."
2,Inspiration on the decline. . .,". . .in this, one of the later installations in Fr. Greeley's ""Time Between the Stars"" series of novels.Although I find myself in profound disagreement with many of Fr. Greeley's theological opinions, I have been an avid fan of his storytelling abilities. In ""St. Valentine's Night"", however, he falls far short of the talent that he really does have.Boy meets girl. Boy almost gets girl. Boy loses girl. Girl (and boy) have miserable lives. Girl and boy rediscover each other years later. Girl and boy have (lots of) sex. Girl and boy have big falling out (over something stupid). Girl and boy decide to grab their last chance at love before it's too late.Sorry, Fr. Greeley, I've seen this theme before. I've seen YOU play this theme before, and with much greater skill. Nothing really new here."
2,St. Valentine's Massacre,"This is an awful book. His favorite character, Father Blackie, intrudes here and there, but the book is basically about an anchorman, his love life, and a mystery. The writing is poor and repetitious. Greeley (or his amanuensis) was just looking for fillers. Certain phrases are repeated...and repeated...and repeated. And how many times do we want to witness the lovemaking of the middle-aged anchorman and his train-of-thought adoration of his love? I felt like several someones forced themselves to sit down and write 300 words a day, not caring what had been written previously and not being sure where the plot was going. The characters are cardboard cutouts."
5,THE BEST CD EVER!!,I LOVE BIG CITY ROCK!Their songs are great to just listen to or to work out to!When you go to heir concerts they are the nicest people i know.I play the bass guitar and when I told Tim (the bass player of the band) that i played bass he told me that anytime i needed help with one of their songs just to e mail him and now whenever i have a question on bass lines he helps. The band always takes time out to talk to their fans and they are awsome. This music will make you smile and it is great to dance to. Put on the CD shut the door and dance like nobodys watching!!!I hope more people buy this cd and see how great Big CIty ROck is :)thx for listenin!
4,Great information.,"This is a very informative book on the crop circle phenomenon. I have not read any others so I have none to compare it to. However, the information and analysis presented in the book was enough to give me some ideas as to their origin, and recognize some commonality between the different types of circles.It is liberally sprinkled with good illustrations and photographs(Albeit, some of them black and white...).If you want to learn about crop circles and want a good balanced look at the phenomenon, this is a good starting place."
3,Not bad - not good either.,"More medium than well-done.If you skip all the non-relevant story-telling (""I had to climb over the barbed wire with my shorts on..."") the book shrinks by more than a factor of two.The ""sort-of-scientific"" character of the book is refreshing, however, it seems like Linda does not really understand everything she talks about, and that is too bad. Her phrasing is often quite confusing and sometimes even disturbing (just like the other reviewer I also have a degree in physics).Moreover, many of the 'anomalous lights', however, look more like ordinary lens flares to me. Too much wild speculation here!Nevertheless, the book gives a good overview of this fascinating phenomenon, the events and people that surround it, and the atmosphere in the south of the UK."
1,The Shamstress,There couldn't be a bigger sham than LMH. Just a way to make a living without working. As one reviewer noted she just rehashes others earlier research.
4,Great Book!,"Fabulous book! I have always suspected that crop circles were real, and this book clinches it for me. The only negative side to the issue of crop circles is that all of those ""vanished"" crops could have been used to feed 1000s of people! These aliens (or whoever they are) seem very shortsighted. Higher intelligence? No way! Perhaps the crop circles only exist because hungry aliens are not bright enough to grow their own food! So what's the answer? All farmers should leave notes next to their fields saying ""Do these crops look good to you, punk? Feeling lucky? If you take these crops you better pay for them (U.S. Dollars only, no currency from Andromeda)""!"
5,An exciting American debut,"The Figurines, like other great groups such as Blonde Redhead and The Arcade Fire,cannot be easily pigeonholed. Nor should they be. Together since 1995, this is their first American release (though they have released earlier CD's in Europe which can be ordered through any good record store). Tracks 1 through 12 are very strong, displaying their musical and instrumental prowess. The vocals are outstanding."
4,the best of the retro trend,"well, interpol is pretty darn good! but, comparing this to say franz or the killers or futureheads, this record is soild. very solid. there are a couple so-so tracks (back in the day, ghost town. i guess this sounds cool in denmark, here it's just hokey.) the best songs on this disc are terrific examples of great songwriting, performed in a high energy style with an interesting singer. sometimes it's easy to forget that the vocals on any record are so critical. if they weren't i guess we'd all be listening to instrumental stuff. the point here is that though danes, tracks like i remember and the wonder are universal in their immediacy and intimacy. these guys are really close to becoming a majorly great band. tighten up, boys. focus on crafting an album sustaining the lofty highs reached at times on skeleton! and the world will be yours."
3,"Some good, some 'flat'","I have enjoyed some of this 'Lions of Judah' series finding some interesting perspectives as Morris attempts to 'flesh out' the Biblical story. Though some of the characterizations seem true, others don't come across as valid in this book."
3,food mills are great but this one is small,"This was my first food mill -- they are really an incredible kitchen tool, make the smoothest mashed potatoes, great purees, and the low-technology makes using one of these extremely accessible. However, this one is kind of tiny. It's great for a single gourmet, and just ok for a single gourmet in love cooking for two. Also, after time (and I mean a long long time)the disks will begin to rust and you will wish there were a place to get new ones. A good starter, but not the dream food mill."
3,Small Bookcases,"this book details 11 different bookcases: simple short, simple tall, shaker-style wall shelf, standing v-shelf, country colonial, trapezoidal, shaker-style with doors, arts and crafts, barrister, formal sideboard, and step-back bookcase. All nice-looking and well detailed. Most using solid wood, some using a little plywood. for me though not any plans for large free standing bookcases. i ended up designing and building my own 8-foot by 3-foot units with paneled sides and locking doors out of solid teak using very simple construction. this book needed some more fancy designs with dimensions i used."
3,Not on my bookcase!,The book is okay but I expected a few more examples on simple projects. On the other hand it lacks a visual culture about books and the way to keep them. This book will not stay long on my bookcase.
5,Excellent resource,"This book is a great resource to lyme patients who are seeking alternative treatments to antibiotics. It explains the life cycle of the spirochete, as well as the fundamentals of electromagnetic medicine.I highly recommend this book, as well as this type of treatment."
5,Chock Full of Information,"I am so grateful this book was written. It is the only book of its kind on the market and for those with chronic Lyme Disease like myself, it provides the necessary information on how to use Rife technology to recover from Lyme Disease. In addition, Bryan provides a lot of information on supportive therapies for Lyme like the critical importance of magnesium supplementation and how to use oxygen therapies.Without this book, I never would have been able to weed through the information on the web to determine if Rife therapy was right for me. After reading it, I came to the conclusion that it is well worth a try. I wish I could tell readers whether or not it has worked for me, but I cannot. I am only 2 months into the therapy. However, I know what to expect, when to expect it and how long it will take. Thank you so much, Bryan!"
5,The best teacher I ever had.,"I just wanted to say that I started watching Bob Ross on tv and got interested in the wet-on-wet technique around 1990 or 91. I sent for paints and some of his books. How anyone can ever say anything against this man , is beyond me. I even miss his little squirrel! I haven't painted for about seven years now. I'am retired and have the time now. I live in West Virginia, moved from Ohio. This is beautiful country here. I'am sure getting the urge to start back in painting. I need to get new supplies. Please send me a catalog. Paul Sensabaugh P.O. Box 6, Wva. 25123."
3,Playboy - Inside Out 1,"This is worth it, if only for the short directed by Alexander Payne (Election). It's hysterically funny! In it a woman drifts into sleep while fantasizing about numerous oddball men coming into her room and doing things to her (such as pouring cream corn over her body). Great work! If you're only into the ""erotica"" though, you may as well look elsewhere. The only originality here comes from Mr. Payne's sharp wit."
1,Buyer's remorse,"After buying and reading through this book I was extremely disappointed. As the cover would suggest, I was expecting actual thorough and thought out explanations of each scale and their applications in playing jazz. Instead, what's presented is a lackluster compilation of hand drawn scales depicting each mode (photocopied by hand and not even straight in some cases), followed by a few short sentences explaining a very bare bones technical application of the mode. The word ""jazz"" is not even used once in the book, besides in the books actual title and in the brief background given on the author. Do not waste money on this book, it will not help you or teach you much about jazz."
2,"loose pages, not the normal way this book is printed","This book was recommended by my daughter's guitar instructor. He has seen many copies of this book belonging to his other students, none of which had loose paper inserts stuffed in over blank bound pages. The copy I sent back was this way AND the new copy I received as replacement from Amazon was this way, as well. Seems to be a very unprofessional printing job."
5,I Love this Book!,"This book has made me so much better at Jazz improv. If you have the drive, then this will give you all you need to have in your fingers to start justly applying the theory and compositional aspects to your improv. Do yourself a favor if you are serious about improved improv!"
3,"""PLAYBOY'S AMERICAN STYLE PARODY""","First,there are about five stories explored in this movie video.The stories are set usally in different time period in american history,with the ""Farmer's Daughter"" being the best.Funny,romantic interludes at it barest view, for viewers who appreciate both naughty nudity mix with ""Benny Hill""-like satire.The only disappointment is the missing short story starring 80's hottie Teal Robert as the Queen.Teal Robert's version was last seen on Playboy cable in the early 90's."
2,"Lovely Ladies, Bad Scenes","This is an older Playboy video, and while many of the women were beautiful, the whole thing screamed cheese. I agree with the other reviewer - it was often far too silly or corny to bring any heat. This one was a miss."
1,Wrong item - picture deceptive!!!,"I received all black pens, not the different colors that were in the picture. I called the seller. They did not refund my money, but ordered something else for me. Said that product is no longer available. I never heard back from them nor did I receive the different colored pens. This is a bust!!!"
5,rockets missiles and men in space,"i read a 1968 version of this book and loved it, i highly reccomend this book to those who are new to rocketry. it is an example of how to take a semi complex subject and teach it without oversimplifying or getting out of reach of the reader. i was engrossed until i finished the book."
4,Some pretty ladies,I think Julia Cialini and Stacy Sanches are the best part of this tape. But Dannelle Folta and Victoria Zdrok are also two of the most beautiful ladies your likely to ever find.
4,Exotics Aplenty!,"#1 to me is Lisa Scott who is a 1/2 Japanese dancer and is my co-favorite 1990s Playmate (with Rachel Marteen), but she has better scenes in ""Rising Stars & Sexy Starlets"" and ""Wet & Wild VII: Hot Holidays"". I belong to two Yahoo Groups that have many photos of her, and I often check her website. I studied Japanese in college.#2 is Maria Checa from Colombia who has sexier scenes than Lisa does in this video, and she has other good scenes in other ""Playboy"" videos I own.#3 is Sexy Soviet Victoria Zdrok who has better scenes in ""Sexy Lingerie 5"". January 2009 Playmate Dasha Astafieva liked my greeting to her in Russian on Twitter. I studied Russian in college.#4 is Danelle Folta whose scenes are rather sexy. She has some in a ""Wet & Wild"" video too.#5 is Elisa Bridges whose untimely death was unfortunate. Her scenes are sexy in this video.#6 is Kelly Gallagher who is rather sexy and her scenes aren't bad, as far as ""Playboy"" videos go."
5,satisfied,I don't know why I can't find these push button pens at a local store. I love these pens. They write well even if you slant your pen while writing.
1,Disappointed with writing quality,"I was disappointed with the writing quality, especially after reading all the positive reviews. The ink does not flow uniformly. The ink skips & leaves light spots.I will stick with the Zebra F-301 pens (black, fine). Their ink flows uniformly & their ballpoint glides much smoother on paper."
5,Best Pen Ever Made,I've been using these pens for more years than I can remember. I'm a nurse and I work in an old fashioned (but Harvard affiliated) psychiatric hospital that depends on written records to a great extent. I love the fact that I can copy medication administration sheets with very little downward pressure. The light touch and fine point also allow for incredibly small characters if needed. I am constantly puzzled by the fact that nobody in my social milieu seems to be aware of what a great pen it is. One of my motivations for writing this is my fervent hope that Pilot continues to make these. (See blog in today's NYTimes online edition about consumers in mourning over discontinued products!) I try to defend against this eventuality by purchasing several boxes at a time. If anyone from Pilot is reading this: PLEASE KEEP MAKING THEM AND DON'T MAKE ANY IMPROVEMENTS!
5,Best Pen Ever,"I love this pen! I am a nurse and must have a reliable pen. I have tried many of them and this is by far my favorite. I have been using it for many years. There was a retailer in my area that carried it but then they stopped stocking it.(I can't imagine why) Anyway, I had to find it so started purchasing it on the internet. It is always reliable, never leaks, has an excellent feel in your fingers. I will continue using this pen as long as it is available."
5,Best Ballpoint Pen,"Instead of Better Ballpoint Pen, it should be Best Ballpoint Pen, because it really is. I use this pen to do my nurse notes, because it writes clean and thin. It has enough traction that gives better control to handwriting everytime."
5,Husbands Favorite Pen,Thank you for putting these Pilot pens on sale on Amazon. My husbands looks in every store we go in to find these pens and he just can't find them. He does not like the ones with the big rubber grip where you hold it. So these are perfect and the fine point is just the right size for enteries in his checkbook. Also I cannot believe the Fast shipping. I just ordered these the other day and here they are already!! I will be buying more in the future. Thanks again. C. Hall
5,Great ballpoint pens!!,These are the best pens made...Not sure why they don't carry them in the office supply stores...they should!!
4,"Fun Stuff,! (Adults ONLY, Please!)","Dirty Stories 2 is just what the the title implies: Dirty Stories. ...The stories are mostly humorous, and some of them are really hilarious; Among the funniest are Johnny Ryan's ""A Day in the Life of Long-Dong Silver"" and Ivan Brunetti's ""10,000 Mile Long Schlong"". Tasteless? Yeah. Funny? Yeah. There is also a pair of truly tasteless ""Maakies"" stories from Tony ""Sock Monkey"" Millionaire, and a couple of dead-on parodies of old-school Marvel Comics. (The Spider-Man parody is hilarious!) If you're feeling adventurous, and you're not easily offended, step right up!"
3,"Didn't fit, photo needs more detail","I'm a small, but I have a biggish top and so this (as well as the merlot version, which I had also ordered) did not fit me. Since the photo quality was not that detailed, for this one as well as the merlot one, the curduroy was much thicker than I thought. Also like the merlot, I wish I had a better clue about the floral pattern before I bought it; seeing it more clearly now I don't like the pattern. I am sending this back to get it refunded."
2,Improper size guidelines- odd measurements- just does not fit.,"I loved this dress when it arrived in the package- looked very pretty and unique. But their sizing guidelines are WAY off. It is very small in the bust and I cannot zip it closed because the bust area is too tight. If you buy this, definitely order one size bigger than what you think you need! I am always a size medium in almost every single top/dress I have worn in the past 5 years, and this dress, in the bust size, does not measure up to a standard ""medium"". The only medium it might fit is a 12-year old girl. Definitely not properly sized for adults."
2,Not a guide at all,"This guide is, in fact, mostly written in English. The second problem is that it deals too much with the mechanics of the language and fails to provide enough pronunciation, and Italian phases. I found the technical reading boring and difficult to conceptualize. The words are provided but not in any context where one can learn the language.The bottom line is that, unlike what the book promises, you will not be able to 'maximize your understanding of key Italian concepts and terms'."
5,awesome learning,"this is a great book for learning Italiano. this pushes you. like it will throw in Italiano words in the middle of a sentence without interpretation, which is good to help you learn. there are lots of word lists and lots of explanations of the Italiano grammar. there are also a fair amount of drills too, which is nice. it's like an all-in-one book.this book is for the beginner though. so if you already know a bit of Italiano it might be redundant OR it might just be a refresher course.I started reading it as soon as i got it and already i learned so many new words. it is very easy to read and learn from. I'm sure there are some area's that could be improved, like any book, but I don't worry about that. i just learn what i can. so far I'm very pleased :)"
4,Beneath the Underdog,"This is a good look at the life of Mingus, written in a very open, honest and conversational style. It isn't so much about his music life, as about his lifestyle that helped create the jazz he played. If you want an in-depth look at his recording career and concerts then look elsewhere, but if you want an in-depth look at the man then this is the place. You get plenty of stories of his childhood and various loves, as well as his experiences with being a pimp and in a psychiatric ward. An engrossing read, I gave it only four stars as I came away knowing very little about his music career, but that doesn't take away from the intimate nature of this autobiography and portrayal of the man.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,Great model for its price,The model itself don`t require glue or painting but is highly adviced.Construction was kinda complicated for a non grade 1/144 model that was a plus for me.cons:no clear part for sword and lack of extra accesories (again this is a non grade kit so is only natural)
4,It didn't get my boyfriend hot enough,it was very sexual. it turned me on in so many places. My boyfriend had never seen me that excited.
4,impressive,"The movie was ordinary with the exception of the Cordovan sisters. Their scene was so steamy and hot that it stole the whole show! If you ever want to know what two sisters making love is like, this is it!"
2,Peanut butter spirutein,Not all that great will not be buying this flavor again but will by the chocolate for sure once I am able to finish this can.
5,tastes good and not chalky,This is the only nutritional shake I enjoy drinking. It is non-dairy and unsweetened. I like to sweeten it with stevia and mix it up with unsweetened almond milk and some type of fruit and ice cubes. I drink it after working out and I find it very refreshing and I feel replenished.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I read a book about 6 months ago, explaining the embalming procedure. This video shows very little of it. Most of what is done, is glossed over, verbally. The back of the video reads that the process is shown from the removal of the body to the open-casket viewing. Not so. I was hoping to see the entire procedure from start to finish. I was disappointed."
1,What A Disappointment!!,"Upon opening the video package and observing the length of tape, my expectation plummeted. I knew this could not be the ""whole story"" and I was correct. While presented with style and ""taste"" and interesting fact about the history of the subject, it nevertheless glossed over the details of the procedure and left almost everything else to the imagination of the viewer. Anyone truly interested in the process would want to see it from ""pickup of the deceased"" to ""disposal of the remains"". This video left a big gap, infact ""they"" may as well have saved the time and money invested producing this ""documentary??"" Do it RIGHT, that is film it as it happens in real life and forget the sugar coating!!!"
3,unfinished education video,There should be a begining to this educational video and an end it does NOT show clothing or casketing the body which leave's this video unfinished.
5,If you don't want to spend $500 on an espresso machine this is for you!,I have been known to enjoy my espresso and lattes on a daily basis for years and after moving away from my previous lab where we had a very nice espresso unit I had to come up with a solution. I found this set and could not be happier. I have a gas stove and this looks great on the stove and makes an awesome cup of espresso and an even better latte. Super easy to clean and maintain. Could not be happier.
5,After much searching...,"This product has exceeded all of my first-time home espresso maker expectations! I was initially searching for a fancy, countertop pump machine. For far less money and counter space, I chose the Bialetti set. It's perfect! The espresso is very easy to make, clean-up is a breeze, and the milk frother works incredibly well with both regular and soy milk. The foam remains on my drink until the last sip! After months of indecision and buying and returning an expensive pump machine, I'm so glad I found this set!"
4,Mmmmm Coffee,"If your are new to the whole espresso scene, this is a great place to start. Not that it is not for the coffee veteran, but it is a good and cheap way to start to experiment with making espressos, cappuccinos and such. Its not difficult to operate and produces pretty good results. After my 5th time making a cappuccino, I let my wife sample one. She was impressed. She said ""To hell with Starbucks""."
5,Works great & tastes great - just like in Tuscany!,"This is an amazing product and it works great! We used one of these for the first time when we stayed in a villa in Tuscany two years ago, so I thought I'd recreate that experience here at home.I am absolutely started at how well the milk froth unit works. It's unbelievable. And so simple. The froth is as good, or better, than commercial machines make and there's no high pressure wand or any of the other trappings involved. I've only just had my first cup, but it was far easier and far better than expected.Sometimes you have to go back to the old school way to have things done the right way. And this little stove top unit proves that!"
4,Great product,"I got this for Christmas. The day after, I made my first latte. It turned out great. The directions were clear, the espresso maker and foamer are easy to use. (Though the foamer directions say 'shake' but I think they mean 'pump' because that's what worked. Poor translation from Italian, perhaps?)I got 3 good sized lattes out of one batch. I could probably have made 4 smaller ones. I've printed out a few latte recipes and look forward to trying them.I wanted this set because most of the cappuccino machines in my price range did not get consistently good reviews. This set is a great price, simple to use and has few breakable parts.I'm very happy with it."
4,Organic,"The weak link in this system is the operator. It can make *great* espresso and stiff frothed milk (even skim) but ""timing is everything."" At first I enjoyed the process -- kinda like the Japanese Tea Ceremony. But when you just want a latte to open your eyes while you're mutitasking, getting ready for work, a more automatic system is much better for me. I can't fault the system for my weaknesses, and it is *much* better than the $30 throw-away Mr. Coffee chinese made machines. Overall I like it and haven't thought about replacing it. When I finally melt the aluminum parts or burn the teflon off the frother, I'll probably buy a capsule espresso system.If you're retired I'd give this 5 stars; if you're working, 3 stars."
5,Best Coffee Ever,What a great product! Made the best coffee I have ever tasted. Use Lavazza Coffee and you will never buy coffee from a store!
3,why not just get the one that makes the steamed milk right in the top?,"Just curious, after reading your reviews, it sounds like u were looking for ease, but it sounds like a lot of steps. Bialetti makes one that u put the water in the bottom, the coffee in the filter and the milk in the top! Now THAT IS EASY and delicious...Just wanted to let u know there IS an easier way! That way you do not have to heat up the milk separately (or before the coffee as one reviewer mentioned). I have one just for ease of use, but am getting a Breville DIE CAST (Williams Sonoma)and with those top notch machines, you can put the cups on the top and they get warmed....But for an easy quicky machine, the Bialetti's can't be beat!"
3,Really 6 cups???,"While this thing makes a good cup of coffee, I can't figure out how they can call it a 6 cup espresso maker. It makes exactly 8 ounces of coffee. The separate milk frother makes 32 ounces - is that where they are getting their 6 cups - one cup of coffee plus 4 cups of cream? I had to check when it arrived to make sure they sent the right model - the box says 6 cups."
4,Espresso,i wish I had bought the bigger one; makes an excellent cup of espresso the old fashioned way; what else is there to say it works and the espresso is great
5,Wonderful coffee maker,Love this coffee maker. Easy to use and makes a great tasting latte or cappacino! Can't go wrong with this set.
2,"Made in China, Cheap but Funtional","I would not buy this product again.Although it is a functional product, and inexpensive, it came with the razor sharp blades loose all over the inside of the case.The case itself is very thin, and cheap plastic that will not lost for any length of time.The handles are cheap, soft aluminum. The threads are easy to strip, and if you tighten the nut too tight to hold the blades you will/can strip the threads.I can not recommend this product. It is too cheap, and poorly made.I strongly suggest you pay the extra few dollars for a better knife set."
3,it's a good album if u'r a fan,"first off i am a Huge fan of Jesika's music and by far my fav. is come with me, however this album is ok too...the beats are not as hyped and gets you feeling that dnace mood but it gets you feeling some mood i can tell you that much...i enjoy this album to relax on a friday evening and to clear my mind and so on...if you'r a fan of jesika by all means buy it because you will enjoy it thats for sure"
1,Shipping problem,I requested the product to be shipped to me (Phyllis) in care of my husband (Max). Instead it was addressed to Max and he thought it was some kind of promotion he did not request and threw it away! It is important to address packages correctly.
4,nice sleeves,"Competent design, good functionality. Includes room for a CD and room for a 'CD slick' pamplet to be added."
3,Fell apart within minutes,"My cat tore the tail feathers and ripped the cotton guts out of this thing like it was nothing. These are made to fall apart. That being said, he loved doing it."
4,not too shabby,got this for my ex's cat and he loved it. lasted rather long in comparison to other toys he had gotten the little guy.
2,Thin elastic broke within minutes,My cats loved the toy but the thin elastic string broke within minutes. Perhaps they are unaware of the strength and teeth of the average cat? Cheap thrill for the kitties with emphasis on cheap quality.
3,Good for kids 04-17 and for collectors.,"Pretty dope toy my boy loves it, we are going to collect a few more maybe a few of the angels too."
2,WOW !! ALL THAT TALENT ON ONE CD,"so it's a shame I could only give it 2 stars. While I am familiar with most of these artists, and generally like their respective styles,I am amazed that this example is so poor. Speed doesn't mean quality, and most of these cuts simply sound messy. It's ok to show off, but a jumble of notes at top speed just falls flat. This CD reminds me of the Doc Watson/Bill Monroe collaboration that is pure fast with little accuracy. I really like Bull Harman's version of Arkansas Traveller, however. I have better, more listenable versions of the other choices. Eric Thompson's Forked Deer, and Panhandle Rag are much much better. Dan Crary and JP Cormier are blazingly fast, and a lot more coherent. Steve Kaufman usually sounds a lot better than here, as does Sutton and Nygaard. Flynn Cohen is great too. Sometimes ""tired old traditional"" isn't so bad."
4,"Good, more of the same (with a few improvements)",Not too much has changed since Asobi Seksu's earlier records. The songs tend to be more expansive in sound than on their older releases but because of this the lyrics sometimes sound muddy (or disappear completely behind the guitars) and some songs drag in the middle. Musically and lyrically it's just as good as the older stuff.
2,False promise,"I hate to admit this but I bought this CD based on favorable reviews and the song 'Thursday'. In short, the female singer cannot hold a tune and its quite distracting. While that song is appealing, the album as a whole suffers from her inability to stay in tune."
5,Shoegazer at its best,"Honestly, I've never heard of this group till last week. Normally I would not like what is categorized as 'shoegazer' much less listening to weird name sounding groupsuch as Asobi Seksu. Anyway, my nephew asked me to fix his messed up Ipod and by chance I just stumbled into this great CD while testing the unit.Start from the second track, the sounds came in crashing till you feel all tingly, blissfully totally emerged in its cocoon like surrounding . Some songs are sung in Japanese, but I would not care what the heck the singer is singing about. I just enjoy this addictive, poppy swirling sounds which made my long commute much, much less bearable. This is definitely a joyful discovery for me this year . Asobi very much reminds me of Joy Division, with mix of Blondie and Billy Corgan - all are singing in incomprehensible Japanese verses ."
1,bad item,"delivery was a fair amount of time. Item itself was horrible!!! Unless , when you order a FM/AM/CD/MP3 Stereo System, you are hoping that ONLY the display works and nothing else! This is exactly what i received with my order. PLEASE be very careful ordering this item! (Memorex FM/AM/CD/MP3 Stereo System)Rip off!!! Even if you get one that MIGHT work, very poorly made. As you can tell by my discription. The one i got did not function."
4,passive surround system,i use these speakers in the old hafler circuit configuration for a little rear channel ambience. i like that the woofers are small as not to give the sound a tubby bass effect. they get loud enough for what i wanted and they do a fine job in the way i am using them.
4,Norpro Grip-EZ Granny Fork,The tines on this Granny Fork were a bit shorter than the ones on the original that I used. This fork worked well for cutting shortening in flour for pie dough. The price is reasonable. I'm glad I purchased this item.
5,Excellent product,"I have purchased this item in the past for my daughters. When one of my daughters broke the handle on hers she was so bummed so I purchased 2 for her for her birthday. A great item used for many things, mixing cookie batter, mixing gravy and sauces. I have one that is older, a Foley Fork which has many years under its belt. Cant be without it."
5,Handy tool,"Has a good feel and makes blending larger portions a breeze. Great for scrambling eggs, blending bread crumbs, and when baking, mixing dry ingredients . Hand mixing muffin batter? This is a must have tool."
5,Gotta have,"This funky fork is excellent for mixing. I tossed blueberries with sugar and flour mixture for pie and it worked better than anything else I have ever used. Use this when you are 'tossing' or blending ingredients. Would work well when beating eggs and then adding ingredients to the mixture. After receiving one as a gift, I purchased 8 for friends and relatives as stocking stuffers for Christmas!"
5,Love my Granny fork!,"I love this granny fork, it has a grippy handle which is great in the kitchen when your hands are wet and slippery. It's great for beating eggs or stirring anything. My boyfriend makes fun of me but I catch him using it!! Definitely something you didn't think you need in the kitchen but end up using ALL the time!"
3,Ok for regular paper,"The price is right if you're only wanting to cut regular sized paper. Photo paper, or the like, leaves slightly rough edges."
1,POOR DESIGN,This is a poor design cutter without a horizontal measures to be able the size of your cut. No instruction to how to change the knife. You are better off with a rule and a pair of scissors.Swingline made a mistake to purchase this product.
1,Poorly Made Iron,"We bought this iron because it seemed like a decent choice for the price. However, after having it three years (and using it very rarely), it began to break down and we now have to throw it away. The non-stick coating on the iron plate is unpeeling, which turns into little black balls on your clothes as you iron (not nice on a dress shirt). Also, when I press the steam button, rusty water comes out of the steam holes, staining the clothes. They must have used parts on the inside that rust over time. Spend a little more money and get a better iron - it saddens me to have to fill the landfill with poorly-produced junk like this."
2,Missed the Age Recommendation,I totally missed the age rating on this set when I purchased it and after my two year old niece opened it we realized the set is made out of porcelain. Totally inappropriate. Saw on box in small writing best for 8 year olds and up. What 8 year old plays with a miniature tea set??????? Of course after dropping the teapot on the floor it created a big chip in it. Waste of money. :(
1,Too little,It's super little not for real use. Sorry I bought it I was very disappointed. Not a good idea for a 7 year old!!!
3,Good but....,Really liked it but the tea set is glass making it more likely to break. It is a thick glass but my daughter was still able to shatter it
1,Too fragile for small children,"I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter. She just opened the wrapping, had the basket handle in her hand and the clasp broke, was not attached at all, the basket opened and all the dishes fell out breaking four of them. She was delighted with the set, it is unfortunate that the basket latch was not properly attached."
3,Porcelain,I didnt realize that this set is porcelain when I purchased it for my 2 yr old daughter. Not exactly the safest material for young children.
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this tea set for my daughter as a Christmas gift. When it arrived, I opened it and found that it was much smaller than what the description stated."
1,Tea set,"I found this tea set unacceptable. The original sets had padded inserts on the inside of the basket so when the basket was closed the pieces stayed in place. When the basket is closed on this set, the pieces fall all over the place. What could be more frustrating for a child? Half the fun of putting away the tea pieces is nestling them in their proper padded places. I wish Amazon would remove this item from their catalogue."
3,They are porcelain,"The tea set is adorable and my niece loved it anyway, but when I was shopping on here the picture did not say porcelain, but when I received the set, the box did. Not exactly what I had in mind....."
3,Small,"I bought this tea set for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. She enjoys giving tea parties for friends and family. We were having a difficult time finding a decent set for a 9 year old. The dimensions are very unclear. The set is cute, but the size is very small. The little cups might hold a tablespoon of water (maybe). I showed my daughter the gift that she had helped me pick out online (prior to Christmas because I was afraid that it would be disappointing), and she almost started to cry. I am still looking for a slightly more mature tea set."
1,NOT AT ALL LIKE PICTURE,THIS ITEM DID NOT LOOK LIKE THE WEB PICTURE.IT CAME GRAY /BLUE AND HOT PINK NAPKINS.VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN RECEIVED...
1,what a waste of money,"Too expensive for all that it offers, just left with many regrets. You basically still have to by additional pieces to go along with set."
3,Good but Could be Better,"Im a huge CowBoy Bebop fan so it was a no brainer that I'd by the entire series of Manga, but when I got it I was slighlty dissapointed. The art work was definitly not what I had been expecting and while it was still very good, it definitly had room for improvment and differd greatly from the art work used in the series. The story lines were good and easy to follow but I wouldn't suggest this series to somone if they don't already watch the show"
3,Good product once I got it to work,"Does what I want it to...bridges my network so I can run my xbox from the other room without needing a 50-foot cable.Only bad thing was I got it and it had a EUROPEAN POWER ADAPTER in the box, not sure if that was because this product was meant to be sold in europe or just a fluke of amazon shipping, but beware. Took a week and a half for them to ship it to me, and then I had to wait another week for a power adapter to get here from the manufacturer."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this product to connect my Replay TV to my wireless network. It got great reviews so it must be good, right? Sadly, this didn't work for me. It was so frustrating trying to configure the device. I was about to call support when I saw the Linksys WET54G Bridge - now this one works for me."
4,Great for someone getting into higher reading,"Kafka is among my favorites and this is a decent copy of ""The metamorphosis"". For the price you can't beat it and if family or friends would like to borrow it you won't feel bad if you don't get it back! ;)"
3,Good reading,"The metamorphosis is perhaps Kafka's most famous story. It is about a man who suddenly wakes up as horrible creature (whose appearence is left to the imagination of the reader). His whole life changes and his room becomes his world. His family begins to forget him as he becomes an embarassment for them. The end comes as unexpected as the metarphosis itself.I found the other stories not as interesting as the described above, and some of them have a very strange end, if we can call it so."
4,Powerfully Disturbing,"This thin edition, containing only a few of Kafka's short stoires, seems unlikely to cause the powerfully disturbing reactions that it brings out in its readers. In his story ""The Metamorphosis,"" Kafka writes a tale of how a salesman turns into a bug overnight. As unlikely as this situation sounds, Kafka succeeds in making the situation seem real by going into extreme detail about both the physical and emotional effects of the character's metamorphosis. Although logic prevents anyone from actually believing they may turn into a bug, readers can still relate to the common emotions of the story, of being alienated and unwanted, of being a cumbersme burden unto others. The other stories in the edition are equally engaging and disturbing in their realistic, sometimes frightful descriptions."
3,Lovely but lacking,"I like this book and its sister book, Family Houses by the Sea (which I prefer). Both books, however, make me feel that I am simply looking through a window at something I cannot have. I find I prefer a new book called Second Home, because it offers the same kind of yummy dreamlike quality yet talks to me about how I can make my getaway dream come true. If you can afford a stack of books on retreats, add this Family Houses volume to the pile. If you can only afford one or two books, I highly recommend Second Home instead."
3,Country Houses,"Book had alot of beautiful pictures of family homes from all over the world..Nothing that I could adapt in my home, but a fun book to have in my home."
5,Noye's Fludde...a masterpiece,"Having been in countless productions of ""Noye's Fludde"" over a forty-year period, it was good to hear an original recording of it from Orford Church in 1961. This is a short opus of Britten, but one that is expertly composed. Every note works in the piece and Britten's use of percussion instruments, especially, is wonderful. Given the fact that this recording is from a live performance only adds to the enjoyment. It's a terrific CD."
3,"Moments of Brilliance, Moments of Disappointment","First off, I should inform the readers that Billy Bang and Sun Ra rank among my favorite jazz musicians. Second, I had no knowledge of Stuff Smith before this album, and have since grown to love his music. That said, I must say that I do at times enjoy this album, but find myself wishing it had been recorded before Sun Ra's stroke, or perhaps (I hate to say this) with a different pianist. Billy Bang shines throughout, and at times his playing sounds better than ever. Unfortunately, Sun Ra's piano just brings sadness to those who are familiar with the work of his prime. And so the what ifs of history continue..."
2,Not for keyboard instruments,"I bought the Peterson V-SAM virtual Strobe Tuner. I was, apparently, not careful enough to recognize that no keyboard related review was available. I need it for harpsichord tuning. However, the response for the lowest octve, (roughly F1 thru F2 at least) and the highest (at least G5 thru G6) is not at all usable.It works ok in the middle range between these low and high ranges, deteriorating on the way to them from the middle."
3,rub a dub dub,This tape is typical playboy waste of money. The chapter called Rub A Dub Dub that is of the triplets taking a bath is worth the price of the entire DVD. This chapter is a smokin' hot piece of soft core that gives you a jolt in the jollys.
5,FF Classic Collection,"These are your favorite FF Classics, and even some that weren't released within the US before the PS1. All of the games work without error, and are in new condition (in the original seals).Note that these games are the greatest hits versions, and are reproduced by Square-Enix. When you receive them, you'll notice that it says Square Enix, instead of Squaresoft. That's because these games are special ordered from Square-Enix, and they simply updated the logo. Nothing else has changed.I love these games, and wouldn't trade them for anything. They're a must have for any FF Collector."
1,"Great games, crappy price.",Makes no sense to pay about $87 when you can buy the games individually directly through Amazon and get free super saving shipping for about $54. With the money you're saving you can also add in Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy 8 or 9.
2,False Advertisement,"I was very unhappy when I received my order. The Product details specifically say that these were black label titles, and since I'm trying to collect these games it made me excited. However, all the games I received were greatest hits titles.Don't say they are black label games if you aren't going to send out actual black label games."
5,3???,Im simply want to ask a question and its this.... WHERE IS FINAL FANTASY 3? I would love to get this (if I can get a ps2)
1,Not the item ordered,The specifications say this will have a 0.40mm micro tip. It does not. The tip included is 0.70mm. This is the second time this has happened to me. I then have to switch to (separately ordered) 0.38 refills.
1,Do Not Buy This One,"Not only is this book awful for it's smarmy tone, it also contains misinformation in certain areas. Get John May's book instead (ISBN: 0818406046).I am a borderline bibliophile, and in the rare cases when I get rid of books (usually because of duplicate copies), I donate them to the local library. This is the only book I have thrown away, because I did not want to be responsible for someone borrowing it from the library and taking it's information as true."
1,Just OK,John explains the game but just goes on & on repeating himself about elements of his philosophy. He tell the same story in all his other tapes and books. Tell me something new.
5,This book can help you stack chips,"Let's face it. Casinos are tough to beat. Yet every book makes it sound so easy. They go into some strategy, tell a few stories about episodes at the tables all while giving the reader false confidence that costs real money. These books rarely delve into the most grossly under-represented aspect of gambling: the loss. Not the case when it comes to books written by John Patrick. Patrick addresses losses for what they are: a sad reality. Truth is that losing and losing sessions are one half of the game. How will you handle that loss? The seasoned gambler knows that all of the table games are tough to beat. This tough player knows that the ""secret"" to winning is catching the streak. How does the veteran do this? How can you do it? Get this book and learn the fundamentals. The rest is up to you."
4,One of the best,I found this book both informative and easy to understand. I have been very successful with his methods.
5,Wonderful modern design,"This Progressive International box grater serves its purpose well and the black rubber feet and ball grip on top make it very comfortable to use. Beyond functionality it has an almost whimsical appearance. It is a very aesthetically pleasing piece of contemporary design and has earned itself a place on my countertop rather than being banished to a cupboard, the fate of more ordinary utensils."
3,works but not perfect,"Pros: stable, large surface area. Cons: not the sharpest cutting. We'll keep it because it's better than our last box grater. We used to have one with rotating cylinder & at the end, it left a slice of cheese that wouldn't grate & got stuck."
2,I've seen greater.,"This grater is not the greatest.The pyramid shape looks cool and everything, but the closed top design and the way it tapers off on the inside make it very challenging and annoying to clean.The best part about it is I didnt buy it. It came with my apartment. No one likes it. I just saw it while shopping for a new one and thought I would take a second to warn the people."
2,Almost perfect. And then junk,Performed well for about a year but eventually 2 of the three feet came off. Metal underneath would definitely scratch so it's junk now. Too bad
5,Good Quality,"After purchasing (and breaking) many graters over the years, I think it's worth it to spend a few extra bucks and get a good quality one. It's large and sturdy. It works great on cheese and on the mountains of zucchini we made into bread this summer and fall. Very good product."
1,Is this supposed to be funny???,"This could be the least funny satire of Hollywood ever written. It barely registers as a novel either. Zippo characters, and though it tries very hard to hip and current and ""in,"" it's clearly from the pen of someone way out of the loop. Sad."
1,Keep looking,"I haven't read too many books on blackjack, but Blackjack for the Clueless was not very good. In a book of about 150 pages, there was maybe about 5 pages of useful information. The book does give an overview of blackjack and strategy (money management, basic strategy, card counting, etc.) plus some random quotes/stories--which weren't that funny or entertaining--and advice on planning your trip (and even discussed what clothes you should wear and lists every casino in the US (10 pages worth of filler material)). Even if you are a new player, I am sure that you can find a better book to get you going. As for the other glowing reviews, I have no idea how they came to their conclusions. Maybe they read a different book?I noticed that the cover image shows a different author than Amazon displays. The author of the version I read was Walter Thomason (1998)."
2,"Cute, but VERY difficult!","Purchased for a carnival party for kids. This machine is cute, but way too difficult. Will only pick up candy like Tootsie Roll Midgets by the end of the paper wraper. Have managed to grab one or two other small candies, but way too difficult. Would not recommend this product."
1,not much info. title is misleading.,"i'm pretty amazed by the number of 5 star ratings.its a small book. about 75 pages of material including a lot of irrelevant pictures of houses and not a single graph.the author does provide a lot of info on where and how to invest in real estate. but its very generic information and is basically summarized. i was expecting the answer to the title of the book, which i didnt get. [to be fair, i spent $550 to get that question answered]he doesn't even mention everywhere he's bought, just randomly some parts of florida and minnesota.he explained the 5th migration of investing in about one and a half pages. could definitely have provided more insight into it.i think the book(pamphlet really) should be renamed to ""how to invest in real estate: a primer"" or going by techie book trends ""the 10 minute guide to investing in real estate"".you get the idea that the author knows his stuff but you feel he's hiding the real meaty stuff."
1,Misleading Title - No Meat On This Bone,"Mr. Garvey did a good job selecting a title for this book, but that was it. There were no real insights here, and even a moderately experienced home buyer will know 95% of the content through common sense. Thank you Mr. Garvey for making this book only 70 pages long(a good percentage of which was used by random pictures of fish, mountains and boat docks).Mr Garvey's recommendation to dumb yourself down and wear dirty clothing in an effort to get information from Southern Local Residents is somewhat insulting. Save your money, this book and his approach are typical of what we get from the Realtors most are looking to avoid. Try Lereah or Freedman for real insight into real estate/baby boom trends that are meaningful.Jack-"
2,Small book; small ideas,"This is a small book of small ideas. Mr Garvey has not written well in this book. He may know his stuff in real estate investing, but he has not written here in a way that is helpful. It is full of generalities, obvious statements, and irrelevancies. I was disappointed."
5,Great Book on the History of American Families,This easy-read book goes into great detail about the structure and practices of many different contemporary and historic American families. Once you read it you'll have a new found appreciation for people from all races and cultural backgrounds.
2,Smart Idea Design Lacks,I should have listened..Great for straining pasta but hard to transfer into bowl. Cleaning is another story-gallons and gallons of water are used to clean and rinse-even then it's not clean. Went back to old colander-too time consuming to use.
5,Works Great,I recently bought this product at my local hardware store. I was a little skeptical at first but it has turned out to be a fun addition to my kitchen. I have even been able to get my kids to help out with salad preparation.
5,Great,Fast service just what we wanted at a really great price if we need something again that they carry will use them again
5,My daughter loves it,"Bought it for my daughter. She loved it, although the four legs didn't exactly all rested on the sink."
2,Good picture - Bad Product,"I could write a long explanation of my problems with this product, but I will just keep it sweet and simple. Mine broke 2 months after I bought it. I tried to get it fixed and (Norpro) told me tuff luck and would only sell me a new one plus shipping!Stick with OXO kitchen Products. I have found their company to be honest and have a good product.Cindy Cook-"
2,"great idea, poor design","i'm disappointed in this over-the-sink colander. several of the little rubber coverings over the feet fell off right away, leaving sharp little feet that can scratch up my kitchen. equally irritating, the silver band at the top of the colander can trap small items, such as rice i've been rinsing. this not only makes it a pain to clean, but forces me to scoop some contents out with a spoon, rather than simply pour them out. i wouldn't repurchase and am tempted to toss mine and find one with a more sensible design.on the plus side, i like the relatively fine mesh and the shape. the large area lets me spread items across the bottom, simplifying rinsing and inspecting them."
3,"Alternative - Same idea, better design, one-third the price","Search Froogle dot com for ""Pierced Steel Sink Colander"" and you'll find a similar over the sink strainer with rubber feet that can't come off for only ten bucks."
1,Grislier than a Cornwell forensic.,"The teenage heroine does not say no to a man old enough to be her father, she then gets almost engaged to his teenage son but soon ditches him to marry his father though she decides to deny him his conjugal rights because she feels guilty about not saying no. Phew! I hope I got everything right. Amazingly the heroine is not in-bred, nor does she live in an overcrowded tenement or trailer. She is the daughter of a rich artist. Rarely have two males in a romance been treated with such contempt. Also it seemed the granny exerted a balefully malign influence in the lives of Daniel and Joss rather than a loving one. Mind you the vengeful Linden is a magnificent read. It all ends happily enough. Emotional and morbidly entertaining."
5,Definitive A-to-Z resource!,"""The Purina Encyclopedia of Dog Care"" by Amy D. Shojai, a former veterinary technician and nationally recognized authority on pet health and behavior, addresses virtually every concern that may arise during a pet's lifetime in a clear, efficient format that enables readers to find answers quickly and easily...this definitive A-to-Z resource covers hundreds of canine topics from adoption and allergies to weaning and whipworms....Book Reviews, Dog World Magazine, November 1999"
2,"Cheap, in every since of the word","I bought this last year at my CVS on sale for about 20 bucks. At the time, I had an ipod and didn't really mess with the Craig. I recently picked it up again and I've put songs on it but can not get it to switch between songs. I've contacted Craig but have not heard back yet."
1,BARELY OKAY FOR A YOUNG PERSON,"I bought this for my 9 yr old. After several attempts of trying to download music using the included driver/software I realized I DIDN'T have to use it since I was on XP...though I didn't see any paperwork alluding to this. The software kept freezing up, but my computer recognized the MP3 player drive and I was able to just copy the songs onto the unit.The quality of sound isn't bad, though, for the price I paid. Doesn't have a lot of extra features, but it works and is exciting for my 9 year old. The only issue I have now is the built-in battery which doesn't seem to charge; it charged initially but not after it drained for the first time. I've had some pretty good luck recently getting ahold of the company, they only give an email address, and according to them they said it sounds like I have faulty unit."
2,Misleading Title,The title leads you to believe that it is a collection of steam and stirling engine plan. But there is only one stirling engine plan. I was hoping for equal (or close to it) sets of plans for both. The info in the book is interesting just not what I was primarily interested in.
2,"Misleading title, disappointing content","First and most damning, there is only one (of 16 total designs) Stirling engine design in this book. Second, from things I had read on the Internet, I had gathered that the designs ran from ""build with hand tools"" to ""need a home machine shop"". In reality there's no spectrum here. There is one design (for a steam engine) that can be built with hand tools, everything else needs machine tools.If machine-tooled steam engines is your thing, I'm sure this book is great. For someone wanting to build hand-tooled (possibly building up to machine-tooled) Stirlings, it's useless."
1,Well-made and Useless!,This is a solid well-made product with holes in the mill inserts that are larger (5mm and 3mm) than the size of the seeds you want to keep out of your sauces. I primarily use a food mill for tomato sauces. This device will not work with tomatoes or seeds noticeably bigger(grapes). Unless you are pureeing watermelon you probably will be disappointed in this product.
2,"Pretty to look at, not so nice to use...","Like everyone else has said, it s made very well and it looks great. If you intend to hang it on the wall, this is the food mill for you.If you plan to actually USE the food mill, don't buy this one. My biggest complaint is that the mill simply will not push the food through. Food circles and circles, and hardly any puree goes through the strainer. What does manage to go through is too big because both the holes on both plate inserts are too large. It simply does not work."
4,Great Reading,"Great Book! It was easy to read and I especially enjoyed the lessons learned from child care professionals referenced throughout the book. Provided practical knowledge on everything from up-start, grand opening to dealing with difficult situations like child abuse. Also get Profitable Child Care by Nan Howkins"
3,More of a Center Book,"This book was not as helpful as I really thought it was going to be. I am opening a daycare in my home and this books speaks quite abit about how to run your own daycare ""Center"". She talks about finding space, getting a loan, buying ""Center"" equipment. So if you are going to open your own ""Center"" then its great - but for all of you who are getting your licence to run it out of your home - try something else - especially for the price of the book ! YIKES!"
3,Nice.,Well made and looks clean. The screws that come with it are stupidly short so have 4 longer ones ready.
3,good product - dont buy it from The Storage Store,sturdy product that does what is should. i have no complaints about product. but don't order from The Storage Store. find another company to order from. i was over charged on shipping and they would not respond to me. they charged me for out of stock items!! multiple emails went unanswered and NO ONE EVER picks up their business phone! should have done a charge-back but didn't think of it until it was too late.
4,Works fine,"It's a spice rack, what can I say. I screwed it on the side of the pantry door. It's there, holding various food related items."
5,Spice rack,"Perfect to install inside cupboard doors if you have limited space. Reasonable price, very sturdy. Happy with purchase would definitely recommend."
3,The Duplicate,"This book started off horribly slow where a boy named David finds a machine to duplicate himself but the duplicate dosent solve his problems he makes them worse. The book started off too slow! It doesnt get exciting till the end. It is really boring, the only reason it got this 3 was because the last 2 chapters were good. dont wast ur money!"
5,Does Amazon really want a review of ballpoint pen fillers?,"Yep, these are ballpoint pen fillers. Got ink in 'em too. Whoop-dee-do. One good thing I'll say, though, is that they were priced right and arrived quickly. What more can you ask?"
4,An Easy and comprehansive introduction to the subject,This book consists of three parts. Part1 begins with an introduction on the many body theory and introducing the idea of second quantization. Part2 focuses on relativistic quantum mechanics through relativistic wave equations. The last part is an introduction to quantum field theory using some results from part2. The simple presentation of the subject and the detailed math involved makes this book a comfortable one for a begginer.
3,numerical methods for particles in a box?,"Well to tell you the truth actually , your book is a complete study about quantum mechanics ....Thanks for your book , i got a good result in my exams but my really problem is to find a topic about the above topic......"
2,Cheap is cheap,"These are very cheaply made, I ordered two of these kits for a dual 15 inch box. You have to assemble them which is easy enough just screws but with mine one I couldn't get the screws to fit into one of the bars on either side so the holes for the screws were too large for the screws they sent, this was only one of the bars all others were fine. Secondly of the two sets they sent me two different lengths of mounting screws which I thought was odd. Also be sure you have a lot of mounting room on either side of the sub box, for my box the plate ends on each of the mounts was a bit too long and would run over the edge of the box, I ended up cutting mine down and using some super advise to glue in the last bar and got it work but if you just want something to bolt on look elsewhere. Cheap for a reason you can make them work if you have to."
2,"Really pretty, but","Will not fit a standard toilet. This is for an oval toilet. My mom loved it, till we found out it wouldn't fit."
5,"Almost normal, but not very.","Tim Berne (alto and baritone sax), Michael Formanek (bass), and Jeff Hirshfield (drums) put together a scrappy improv band to play some enduring songs. Formanek's song ""Fool's Paradise"" was reworked under the title of ""Paradise Revisited"" on Formanek's ""Low Profile"" CD. Two of the Berne compositions, ""Broken"" and ""Lowball"" were combined under the name ""Bro'ball"" and played by Berne's group Bloodcount (also with Formanek) on the ""Unwound"" CD. Another Berne composition, ""The 12 1/2 % Solution"", wound up on the Big Satan CD. Obviously there is some choice material here since the artists keep coming back to reinterpret it. Less frantic than the Bloodcount material, more percussive than the Berne/Formanek duo, ""Loose Cannon"" is a solid addition to any not-quite-avant-garde-but-definately-modern jazz collection."
4,Never had a problem with this,"First CD Doctor I ever bought. I bought this when it was first released in stores. And as the first product, it worked great. I lived in dorms at the time, and I had others requesting for me to fix their CDs after seeing the wonderful job this did.The only CON to this product is the hand crank. It gets tiresome. So if you have many cds that need to be fixed, you will wear your hand and arm out fixing CDs. SPend the extra money to get the motorized one, but this is still a great buy.I have probably fixed well over 300 cds with this and the motorized version of this product."
3,"Good, but could be better value","This did its job, I had a several CDs that looked like they were beyond any hope for repair now play fine. There were also some CDs I had that it helped some, but still couldn't play right. After about 10 CDs, it broke; while I suppose it could be said it paid for itself. But I was hoping for more bang for my buck, I don't think I'll be buying another."
4,It works well !!,"I purchased the Skipdoctor and then came here and read the reviews. I must say on my first try, I was not impressed plus I felt I had to read the instructions repeatedly so not to screw it up. However, after reading the reviews I realized it was a good idea to use it at least three times for bad scratches. I am very happy to say it saved my treasured Metallica cds so for that alone I am deliriously happy. Skip doctor works well as I was very skeptical about these so called repair kits but please give this a try before you dump your cds.However my biggest grief with this product was the arm to put the cd onto. I was scared all the while about breaking it off when putting on and taking off my cd. Motorized version was not available for me to purchase but the cranking handle is not too bad. Filmsy plastic design. But otherwise it does what it says"
4,I love this product!,"I've saved no less than a dozen CD's and DVD's with SkipDoctor. It's important to follow the directions EXACTLY in order for it to work, but if you do, it's fantastic."
4,It's a great tool to fix CDs,"It's a really good tool to fix your audio CDs, but your DVDs, It doesn't really help that much. I had to fix my DVD 3 times before it could work perfectly. The first time I used this on one of my DVDs, it was completely messed up, the second time, the DVD worked like brand new. I'm saying that if you want to fix your DVDs with this machine you would have to have patience. To fix a DVD I had to fix it 2 or 3 times, but the audion CDs work perfectly with this tool. I really recommend this machine."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I purchased the Skip Dr at Radio Shack thinking that this would be great to clean up those DVD's that begin to freeze up when they get dirty. I got home home and sure enough I put a movie in the DVD player for the kids and it began to freeze up. I would normally just use soap and water for a dirty DVD and every thing would be fine, but this time I tried my new Skip Dr. The DVD no longer freezes up -- IT HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY THE SKIP DR! THE RESURFACING PROCESS HAS LEFT THOUSANDS OF FINE SCRATCHES ON THE SURFACE OF THE DVD WHERE NONE HAD BEEN BEFORE! THE DVD PLAYER CAN NO LONGER READ THE DISC. YES, I HAVE USED THE BUFFING SQUARE AND TRIED REPEATING THE PROCEDURE A NUMBBER OF TIMES TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY IMPROVEMENT. -NO CIGAR! I AM TAKING IT BACK TO THE SHACK FOR A REFUND!"
2,Try toothpaste & hairspray instead - it's cheaper and quicker.,"I was psyched to fix the disks that made my stereo want to cry as they played one note over and over like a song at a bad rave.You have to spend too much time on each disk if you want to fix your whole collection, or even part of it in one sitting. I made it through 10 disks before giving up (and my hands getting sore) the first night.The product essentially works like this: it comes with a tiny spray bottle, and you crank the handle as the disc turns VERY SLOWLY, and the wheel inside that is lined with a cloth smoothes the spray into the scratches.Effectiveness: It didn't fix my most-played discs, the ones with deeper scratches, but it did HELP with the rest (not good-as-new quality). I have had just as much luck with toothpaste and hairspray. Seriously.Overall I would say it isn't worth the money, time or effort, and it made my hands too sore too quickly."
1,This product is JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This piece of junk should not even be able to be sold!It's a total misrepresentation of a product.I would of rated it a -5 but all you can choose from is + numbers.You might as well use a piece of sandpaper,it would do the same kind of quality of destruction this piece of junk will do!Please don't waste your money on this product unless you just have money to burn.It should be pulled off the shelves and should'nt be sold anywhere,total rip-off!!!!"
1,Too bad you have to give it a star at all,"I just bought this product today and I am taking it back tomorrow. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM. I tried it on 1 music CD and not only did it not fix the small scratch but attempting to take it out it cracked the cd when I tried to pry it from it's kung-fu grip. I wish I would have just bought the cd again. If I were allowed to use explicatives on this review I would use up the 1,000 letter maximum."
1,Do not buy this,"The Skipdoctor completely ruined my copy of Mallrats.So instead of a skip in one scene, I could no longer playit at all. It just does not work as advertised."
3,CANT' FIND REPLACEMENT WHEELS,I read alot of negative feed back and can't understand it. This product works just as described. I've repaired CD's DVD's PS1 & PS2 disk with this. Customers that gave bad reviews must have tried to clean the wrong side... This product works! The PROBLEM I'm finding is replacement wheels. They cost almost as much as the entire Product. $12.00 plus shipping & I haven't been able to find a store that carries them. If I had know how expensive replacment pads were and how hard they are to find I probably wouldn't have bought it... NNAAUUUGHH.. I would just used it only on the disk that were important. You can fix about 15 to 20 disk before the wheel comes apart.
1,THIS IS CRAP!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't bother buying this. This is crap and a waste of valuable money. All it does is scratch it even worse and dosen;t play it anymore. One of my valuable CD's got damaged and it plays like crazy. If you don't believe me, then find out yourself:1) Go to the store(or just buy it here at amazon.com) and spend $20-something on this ""miracle thing"".2) follow the instructions well on this thing.(that's what I did, of course).3)Look at your ugly results. Am I right or not.I have to return this item, get my money back, and replace my CD with I new one(which I hate so much!). If you read this, get my advice: DON'T EVER BUY THIS!!!! THIS IS CRAP!!!! I TELL YOU!!!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This Piece of Junk,"I wasted a lot of money on this piece of junk. I have yet to fix one single cd, dvd or video game disc with this. I even gave it the benefit of the doubt and bought a replacement wheel in order to fix a few video game dvd's and all of them were failures. The scratches weren't even deep. They were just superficial ones. Take my advice and save a whole lot of time and money. It's one of those things that on paper seems like it would work but it does not work."
1,"Lo! I have become death, the destroyer of discs","Had one of these when I was a young lad, it had been marketed in Official Playstation 2 Magazine (Denmark), irreparably damaged copies of GTA III and Metal Gear Solid 2 which I had spent months of allowance to obtain. I was not happy, if you see a skip doctor destroy it on sight before it gets to your games."
4,"Works with games, but not with DVD for me.","I've used this to fix about 6 of my Xbox video games. One was so badly scratched I didn't think it would ever play. I had to run through the procedure about 5 times, but after that the game has played flawlessly. It doesn't remove scratches, but it improves them enough to make it readable. Unfortunately I tried this on a DVD and it made it unplayable. I don't know why. But it has worked great on games for me."
1,Waste of time and money,We purchased one of these to repaid CDs at our company. It didn't fill in any of the scratches whatsoever. We tried to fix the CD twice and it had no improvement.
1,Messed up XBox Discs!,"I bought this item and took it out of the package, cleaned Gotham Racing, DOA3, and HALO. I was stupid and didn't try out each disc after I was done cleaning it. I ended up ruining all 3 discs and my XBox won't even read them! Don't buy this Product it destroys Disc! I lost $150 Due To this item don't make the same mistake."
1,Do Not Use This Product,I father got one of these for Christmas this year. I tried it on one of my Dreamcast games and the game is now ruined. It will not even load in my Dreamcast. It also left permanent marks on the disc. I followed the instructions exactly as they were written. I would recommend trying this product only as a last resort (if your game is already ruined).
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I bought this for $29.99. If I would have been able to use it before I purchased it, I wouldn't have paid more than $5.00.First off, it's a cheap piece of plastic. Second, you have to crank this stupid thing for about three minutes clockwise and counterclockwise. Mine, only went counterclockwise, it wouldn't go clockwise like the directions said it would. The cleaning solution is nothing more than water, it even says on the bottle.There are plenty of other cleaners out there for $9.99.I wrote this review based on cleaning DVD's."
1,nothing but more scratches,"this is the most ridiculous piece of cd repair equipment out there. i bought this thing and followed the directions meticulously, but to no avail. the only thing this machine is good for is hiding scratches on your cds by adding more scratches. if you want to repair your cds DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!!!!"
4,Saved an XBox game from the trash!!,"When I worked at a library we used one of these on our music CDs, so when my son came to me and told me one of his brand new XBox games was no longer working (the machine said the disc was the wrong format), I first contacted tech support who ran me through some options...one being cleaning. So I cleaned the disc manually and although I could see no scratches, it still would no work, so I ordered the skipdoctor.The disc is totally usable again! My kids have since brought me a stack of music CDs that were destined for the trash as they were pretty well scratched up, and I am in the process of fixing all of those.I find the skipdoctor easy to use, and I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Waste of money,We were able to clean two or three games before it broke. The CD's we cleaned were no better after the cleaning than before. I had better luck with a solution from a local music store with cloths to buff it. That cost me 99 cents for 10. Much better!
1,Horrible.,"A huge waste of money. I should have just bought another game! It LOOKS simple, but it has broken my Star Wars KOTOR and many others. I tried everything, and not one CD has been fixed. If your lucky, your CD will remain the same. Seriously. That is the best result you'll get with this. Don'y buy it."
1,Seriously - do not buy this,"I bought this and all it did was create problems. I read other costumer reviews and they all pretty much had the same problem as me: it scratches up the disc to the point of not playing at all. I followed the instructions extremely carefully and all it did was leave deeper scratches. The Skip Doctor may look cool, but it really is a piece of crap. How can someone take pride in selling something like this?"
2,it was a waste,i got home and i tryed it right so my mom she tryed it first so she turns it turn and she looks at me with a mad face. our hey arnold the movie dvd it was all scrtched up and had black lines when we got finsh used the product so my mom took back to target and sad the product was all mast upand the spary!!!!!!!! dint event help me now how u gone have the mecheinehelps cleans yours disc spary dont work cuase since the product didnt work. so we tryed the spary it dint even work wont buy it agin
2,Does not work!,"This product does not work. I tried to repair 10 discs with it and all 10 times it has ruined my discs. I suggest to buy the GameStop Repair disc. It works like a charm, if used correctly."
3,Skip no more,"Nothing worse that sitting with your bride on the couch a Friday or Saturday night with popcorn and half way thru the movie, your dirty Netflix movie starts to skip. This will fix it 95% of the time. Get it - eliminate the frustration."
4,it does work!!,My son was given this product by a friend. He has used it to clean and restore some very scratched DVD and PS2 games. I could not get it to work. He loves it. He uses a little windex and turns the crank and they come out great.
3,SKIP DOCTOR GREAT AT FIRST,When I first purchased this item I thought it was great. It really did salvage quite a few CD's that were unusable. But after a few weeks and lots of 'Skip Doctoring' the handle broke. The company I purchased it from (online) was not willing to repair or replace so I was out the [$$].I liked the Skip Doctor so much that I purchased the motorized version because I thought it would be easier to use since I wouldn't have to turn the crank constantly. It is easier with one exception: The button you have to push to open to insert/remove disk is so hard it made my finger sore after a few attempts.The CD resurfacing wheels become unusable fairly quickly also. They are [$$] plus shipping for 2 and are hard to find in stock.
1,CAN you say shattered CD??,I thought you could. The blank thing has a snap door that refused to snap properly and I ended up with a shattered CD because a part of the skip doctor hit the CD in the right place to shatter it. THE DISK WAS NOT REPLACEABLE.Needless to say I am not happy. Do not use on anything you want to keep. Now I am going to have the devil to pay to find an old software program that works perfectly and no one sells anymore because of the non working improved model.Toss skip doctor in the garbage or demand your money back and be safe.
2,Don't expect too much,"I'd say you've got a 50-50 chance at repairing damaged discs with this item. I've only used it on audio CD's, and I've gotten results ranging from nothing (even after several uses) to restoring previously unplayable discs. It's paid for itself thanks to my excessive collection of damaged discs, but I wouldn't rely on it."
1,too much work!,"Its too much work! you put the disc on the wheel, put the wheel in the thing, then plug the thing in, then press the button, then sit there for 10 minutes while the the wheel slow moves around. Then you take out the CD, then you polish it with the little square piece, gimme a break!"
4,works like a charm,"This product worked just like it said on the box. The only bad thing is the liquid is tons of money. this worked on so many PS2 games of mine.I just know you will like it,no love it. Thank you so much for reading my review."
3,Air Hose,This is a good product and works just fine. I would have given it more stars if it hadn't been made in China. The picture showed that it was made in the US but when it arrived it was differnt. Not that big of a deal I just like supporting the US when I can.
5,Peerless Noir Classic,"The Big Clock belongs in the Noir Hall of Fame as one of the dozen or so superior examples of the genre.It also belongs near the top of every true Noir fan's collection.Each time I see it, I find additional rewards in details and qualities that had somehow escaped my attention.Its only peers are the lapidary Double Indemnity, the compact intensity of The Unsuspected, the hugely rewarding and expansive Third Man and the tragic scope of The Lost Weekend.Buy it. Watch it. Love it. Repeat."
4,The Big Clock - certainly inspired some later films.,"This DVD is good quality.The Big Clock is a real classic film noir, and it is interesting to see some of these actors from the past, especially Henry Morgan sneaking around - didn't know who he was until I heard the voice of Colonel Potter! In addition to being more or less remade as Kevin Costner's ""No Way Out"", the scenes with the giant clock must surely have inspired the similar scenes in""The Hudsucker Proxy""."
4,Sleek thriller - not noir.,The Big Clock is slick and stylish with beautiful moderne sets and beautiful people but this is not noir. The elements of fatalism and entrapment in the twisty plot are undermined by the arch comedy. The characters are too suave and sophisticated - this plays like a knowing parody of noir that was way ahead of its time. Noir films took themselves seriously. The Big Clock would be more than a fine entertainment if it played straight up.
5,Unexpected Pleasure,"This film is not famous, and its credentials are off the beaten path: director Farrow and lead Milland, a respectable actor who isn't usually considered 'tops.'WOW - what a delightful surprise. The sets alone are worth watching the movie for. Direction is tight and always kept my interest. Photography is clear and appropriately atmospheric.All the actors are very good, but the standout is Rita Johnson. What a talent was lost when her career was cut short by an injury! She's sexy, elegant, and just facetious enough to be believable as an 'adventuress.' The rapport among all the actors is just what you hope for in an ensemble piece like this, and the interest doesn't wane after Johnson's character dies.You've GOT to see this if you have any interest at all in 40s suspense films. I bet you'll enjoy the heck out of it, and like me, wonder why Rita Johnson wasn't a big star when far inferior actresses, whom it would be ungentlemanly to name, had big careers."
3,Time for a restoration,"Humor is pretty scarce in film noir -- the giggles come hard while staring into the abyss. Paramount's ''The Big Clock'' pauses for comic relief while recounting the story of a media executive (Ray Milland) racing to solve the murder of his boss's mistress. The film feels like one of Hitchcock's wrong-man tales. ''Big Clock'' is rightly famed for its sweeping modernistic sets, but this disc's indifferent transfer makes it hard to appreciate them. Time for a restoration."
2,Awkward and unbelievable,"A disjointed, lesser noir flick, featuring Charles Laughton as an all-powerful publishing magnate who seeks to pin a murder he committed onto one of his trusted employees. Ray Milland plays the clever editor slated to take the fall; the film flounders as Milland makes dumb mistake after dumb mistake: getting drunk with his boss' mistress, lying to his wife about his whereabouts and generally blundering about making things worse. The growing pile of evidence against him is meant to ratchet up the suspense, but the direction and script are both so poor that the story just seems preposterous and never picks up speed. Laughton's performance is adequate, Milland is a bit irritating. Elsa Lanchester has a supporting role as a kooky modern artist, and a young Henry Morgan (later known as Colonel Potter on TV's ""MASH"") plays a silent hired thug. Skippable."
2,THE BIG CLOCK IS A BIG LETDOWN,"I remember this movie from years back, and thought it was a pretty nifty noir thriller. A repeat viewing reveals it to be a bit on the trite side. Maybe it's Ray Milland's bland performance, but I had trouble getting through this one. Not all old films are true ""classics"" and this one is better left on the shelf, in my opinion.There are many better examples of Film Noir out there. Give me LAURA or OUT OF THE PAST any day over this."
2,hardly the noir classic id been led to believe,"poor ray milland gets caught up in a wacko murder plot and illicit love affair in this overrated film noir from director john farrow, who is best remembered for directing second-rate movies and siring a second-rate actress. even charles laughton is dull here!"
2,5 stars for Elsa + 0 stars for the rest = 2 stars overall,"I loooooove old B&W classic flicks. I love film noir. This movie, however, I just could not get into. Even though it has the fabulous Charles Laughton in it! The lead actor (Ray Milland) did absolutely NOTHING for me -- his character was boring and I didn't give a flying rat's behind what happened to him. In addition, the movie was not very well put together. It was hard to follow and seemed very disjointed or edited really badly. I do not recommend purchasing this DVD. I do, however, recommend spending a couple of bucks and renting it for the sole purpose of the fabulous, fantastic ELSA LANCHESTER. The only time this movie came to life was when Elsa, playing an eccentric painter, was on screen. What a presence she was! I don't know why she wasn't more popular in films, although I believe it was her choice as she preferred the theater. Watch ""The Big Clock"" for Elsa and only Elsa, and forget the rest!"
2,Didn't fix dull blades,"My knives were dull, and this sharpener didn't do the trick. You could probably get a cheap stone set at a camping store and get better results. In fact, my friend ended up sharpening my knives using his stone that he bought for $25.This sharpener DOES sharpen, though. But it's best for maintaining sharpness, not sharpening already dull knives."
4,Worth it,"This sharpener is about 12"" long and doesn't weigh much at all. The course side is not meant to take the large nicks out of your blade. Basically a knife that has been used so much so that is has large nicks out of the blade. I had to use a standard 2x8 flat rough stone to get the blade back. Then used this to finish it off.Bottom line, this with the steel should keep your Henckels from every needing a stone. Ran the rest of my Henckels through this (mostly the fine side)."
3,"It sharpens, but not that great","This item will sharpen dull knives. Just not that great. I've found that it'll make my knives sharp enough to use on steak or onions or garlic--but not on tomatoes. Overall, I'm not all that pleased, but at least it's inexpensive."
4,Works as advertised,I have a set of Henckels Professional 'S' knives. I was always disappointed with the sharpness until I sharpened them with the Henckels Twin Sharp Duo Knife Sharpener. I'm not a chef nor someone who is enthusiastic about cooking and preparation. Follow the instructions and the sharpener works as advertised. I can't compare it to another sharpener and I didn't try to cut paper with a sharpened knife. The knives cut food much better. Good enough for me.
4,Respectable Sharpener,"My Henckel knives were dull ... make that VERY dull. I made multiple passes with each knife through the two slots on this sharpener. It took many more passes than the five recommended in the instruction sheet, but the knives got sharper with every pass. Considering how dull they had become, I think the Twin Sharp Duo did an admirable job of bringing my knives back to a point where it's a pleasure to use them again.Another plus is that the sharpener's rubber feet did an excellent job of keeping it stable while sharpening the knives."
1,Completely ineffective... it does nothing.,"The product's sleek design and nice reviews are no substitute for a sharpener that actually works. This one does not. Following the instructions meticulously, using Chicago Cutlery, the device did nothing more than mark the sides a bit. Sharp spots still sharp, dull areas still dull. Nothing. Zero.Save your time and money."
5,Great knife sharpener,"After reading other reviews, I decided to purchase the knife sharpener. It was exactly what I needed to sharpen dull knives. I would highly recommend for home cooks. Great product and the reviews are always spot on and helps to make my decision easier when I purchase items."
4,For German knives,"This thing does a great job on German knives, but will ruin Shun or other Japanese style knives, which are ground at a sharper angle."
4,"Pretty Darn Good - but not like ""new"" edge, but FAST","Having tried sharpening my Henkle and other knives on what goes for sharpening stones these days (small), the metal in the knives is so hard it can be very tedious and if you are not careful the results are not so hot either. As we don't have a lot of time to spend sharpening, our knives would tend to get dull - which was the reason I bought good knives in the first place.This thing gives like 90% of perfect edge results in less than a minute on touch up, and only a few minutes on truely dull knives - really works great for those who don't have a lot of time. No, its not the same as a factory edge, but its also reasonably priced and works fast.Bonus: Well built, attractive, sturdy, great gadget although my wife doesn't let me leave on the counter you could as its attractive in my opinion."
4,Good product,"This beats doing it manually. Does not provide the original cut when first bought, but for just secs to sharpen knife it is well worth the investment. Still use the steel to get a nice even luster and shine at the tip."
1,Buyer Beware,"I used this sharpener on a knife manufactured by Henckels. The knife is old and has been slowly losing its edge, although I've been keeping it sharp using a hand steel.I tried using the Zwilling J.A. Henckels Twin Sharp Duo Knife Sharpener on this knife and it made it instantly dull.Perhaps the sharpener works well on knives which have not been hand-sharpened. I'll let someone else risk damaging a nice new blade."
4,Compact and easy to use,"The Henckels Twin Sharp Duo Knife Sharpener is a must have for any kitchen. I use it often, to keep my knives sharp and in great condition."
5,Better than the generic sharpeners,"When I bought my Henckel's 4 star knives, the company gave us a free Smith's sharpener. After one year of using these knives, they begin to feel dull even after sharpening (using the Smith's).When I got this Henckels Sharpener I sharpened the knives and immediately noticed how sharp my knives were restored. I did not tell my wife about the new sharpener because I wanted to know if the knives really got sharper or it was just a placebo. Well, my wife used the knives and was puzzled at why the knives got so much sharper all of a sudden. So it WORKED!!Great product and great price."
5,Amazing sharpener,Gets you to slicing-through-paper-razor-sharp. Even with knives that have been neglected and have become very dull.Fantastic product. Very easy to use.
3,worn out,"I thought this was great when I got it. Now, after several years it doesn't do a darn thing."
3,so so,"this is ok for the sharpening challenged. its output is far less acceptable than work with stone and steel on a good knife. however, better than nothing at all. as an alternative, and cheaper, if you don't know how to care for a good knife, take it to your local butcher once a month."
1,dont spend money for this item,you have to be very careful it dosn't look safe but I paid less and I got what I piad for
3,Duo knife shharpener,We have bought this sharpener 4 other times. I give this for christmas presents. this is a very good way to have sharp knives
3,Good for a year,"This knife sharpener is good for about a year or until the sharpening blades start to rip your knives apart. As soon as you find big notches in the blades of your expensive knives, throw it out and get a better quality electric sharpener."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","Bought this about a year ago for my henckels knives. It's one of the easier manual type sharpeners I've used but I wouldn't recommend this if your knives are really worn. There are coarse and fine sharpening grooves, but the coarse one can be tough to use. It may be worth sending them out to be professionally sharpened and then use the fine groove for sharpening in between."
3,Better Than Sharpening Steel,"This sharpener does help sharpen my knives, but I find that I have to be very careful that the blade is straight up and down, and the pressure applied to the knife is not too firm."
2,This doesn't restore a knife,"I have tested this device, in fact it is right in front of me. I have a set of dull mid-range henckels. I have read and followed the instructions, but the knife doesn't not return to sharp. I get a much better result simply using the steel sharpening rod that comes with the set. I am disappointed with this device. It would be nice if it worked well."
4,Quick and easy,"This sharpener worked fine for touching up the edges on my knives (4 star Henckels and some random no-names). For edges that have a correct existing bevel and are dull but not abused, restores a fine edge fast. If the existing bevel is too steep or otherwise messed up this may not work (it's not a grinder). Takes some attention to get a smooth pass without chattering."
4,Effective and nice looking sharpener for Zwilling Henckels knifes,"Modern functional design, good ergonomics, works perfectly with Zwilling J.A. Henckels knifes.Was surprised - it's not so effective with Wusthof knives (if you have them), probably because of the difference in the edge angle and fixed position of sharpening rods.Nevertheless, it's very effective with Zwilling J.A. Henckels knifes. Just keep the knife a little inclined backward - you'll feel the right angle by the resistance of abrasive rods. And don't expect the one move action - it needs the higher pressure on the knife, which can damage the edge. 3-4 moves at light pressure by the steady hand and job is done. Don't forget to use the honing rod."
5,"At last, a sharpener that does the job","I am impressed, I have bought several over the years, some outrageously expensive and so far this one is the best one and the price is fantastic.It won't by itself bring back a neglected or misused blade, you'll need an expert for that but to maintain the edge of your knives on a daily basis, it's perfect"
2,Try another sharpener,"We have Henckels knives, so figured the match would be a good idea. Didn't seem to matter. They shreaded one of the blades, and the others are just not really sharpening. The metal/ceramic sharpeners are a good idea, but not from this company. You can also invest in a sharpening stone, that will do just fine, just a little more work."
2,Average sharpener,Somewhat helpful in aligning the edges of your knives but don't expect it to significantly improve sharpness. The wheels sometimes get stuck intermittently while the knife is being pulled across.
5,wroks on other then Henckels knives,"I own a set of Wolfgang Puck knives which I'm sure aren't as nice as Henckels and this sharpener works fantastic on them. Sharpest knives I have ever used! I think they need to be a high quality steel, which mine..and Henckels are. Cheaper knives are usually an alloy, which may cause some to not see a huge difference after being sharpened.If this sharpener costs more than the knives you are sharpening, its probably not going to help!"
3,kinda ok,"It's ok for its price,not bad if you now how to use it right,for top-notch results I'll stick to my steel though."
3,Not that great!,"It looks good,feel good but It does not sharpen my Cutcos very well.I bought it because other reviews were favorable my experience a bit different.Too bad had great expectations."
2,Why waste time with this?,"I used this on my knives and didn't notice much of a difference after spending a while trying to sharpen them. I must not know what I'm doing, or it just doesn't work well because I ended up ordering an electric sharpener which makes more sense to me. Why do I want to work up a sweat to get a marginal difference in sharpness when I can run it through an electric sharpener and have excellently sharp knives in minutes? Price doesn't matter as much to me as well sharpened knives do."
3,Meh...its alright,"Either my knives suck, I'm retarded or this doesn't work that well. Judging by the other glowing reviews, it very well could be the first two. Yeah, it sharpened my dull knives, but nothing close to what they were when they were new. Granted, its a crappy set of Chicago Cutlery knives I got for free with my credit card points, but nonetheless, they are made of metal so I would think they could sharpen somewhat well. I think I'll return and just go with something I know works well, a good old fashion sharpening stone."
1,"""Made in China"".","""Made in China"".Not exactly something one would expect from famous Solingen craftsmanship. In an attempt to outsource and save a penny some companies are loosing their loyal customers for good."
3,Sharper things,We have a full set of Henckles and needed a good sharpener. This is not the greatest. It will provides a good edge but it takes a lot of work and the edge could be better. Almost sorry I got it. :o<
2,Knife Sharpener,"Sharpens every knife I have, especially the cheaper ones, really good. Does not sharpen the Henkles knives any better than they were. They've never been sharp anyway. My last try is to get Henkles professionally sharpened."
3,Better than nothing,"This sharpener uses two sets of wheels, one to sharpen and one to hone. It hones well but is limited in its ability to sharpen. The wheels are in the same slot. In theory you might use both in one pass, but in practice I found that changing your hand position changes which set of wheels contacts the blade. Knowing this, you can sharpen and hone separately. The Twin Sharp is handy for touch-ups and I used it between regular sharpenings until I gave it to a friend. Learn more at http://www.ameritech.net/users/knives/index.htm"
3,does the job,"Got this knife sharpener for by bf who loves to cook, but hates sharpening his expensive knives. He says it works pretty well, but we haven't had it long."
4,Compilation with more hits than misses,"Some good stuff from unknown bands. Check out the Brazen Hussies track brutal yet beautiful, dynamic yet chilling!"
5,Really wonderful book,"I spent a summer as a kid freediving and spearfishing in La Jolla, Calif.. This book took me back to that time and documents a history of spearfishing that goes all the way back to its birth here in the US. A really great read. I was sad when it was over. Wonderful first hand accounts of the men who went deep and who are still discovering the biggest and last frontier on our planet."
1,"Boy, am I disappointed!","I had been using the Zyliss cheese grater for some time and, while it seemed to work well, the stigma of using plastic hung over it. So when the Norpro came up I ordered one pronto.It's vastly inferior to the erstwhile lowly Zyliss! It's clunky, the grating wheel falls out after you assemble it, it requires much more pressure than the Zyliss, and doesn't operate nearly as smoothly. My initially favorable impression (when I took it out of the box) has been replaced by disinterest. If I'd only saved that aforementioned box I'd have sent the durned thing back, but I'm relegated to eternity with it clanging about in the kitchen drawer. I just don't have the cojones to throw it out. Oh, well, buyer's lament.Bob"
1,Not a fan,"I am sorry I bought this product. I have used a similar grater for several years. It is made of plastic and I liked it so much I thought I would purchase one in stainless steel. Unfortunately, this new grater has a problem. When you place a wedge of cheese in the barrel, it will grate just fine up to a point but, long before the wedge has been exhausted, a large piece of it will suddenly fall from the bottom of the grater - still intact. It is so frustrating that I have thrown the stainless steel grater aside and gone back to the plastic one (which I probably got a dollar store for a lot less money). I will probably sell the stainless steel grater in a rummage sale to see if I can recoup some of my loss."
1,Disappointing,"I was excited about buying and reading this book. However, I soon realized that it was a waste of time and money. The author notes the obvious and seems to ignore the more intriguing aspects of many paintings.An opportunity wasted!"
3,Whets the appetite,"A great little book if you're looking for basic lessons on art symbolism. Definitely leaves the reader wanting more details, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, if you have time to do more in-depth research when needed.The illustrations and highlights are well thought out. But overall, was hoping to get a lot more from this book.EDIT 5/2012:I've found a FABULOUS book on symbolism in general, for those of you who are interested. It is simply called The Book Of Symbols, published by Taschen. Search-bar it - you can't go wrong."
2,Superficial treatment of paintings,"The book offers only superficial descriptions of the paintings reviewed. It offered no advice on "" How to Read a Painting"".I consider the purchase a waste of money !"
2,Good for the UNcaring teacher.,"If you are a caring teacher, then despite the title, this book is not for you. You will not find anything new or profound here. I agree with a previous review--this book offers no concrete advice and is not based on a realistic view of the behaviors exhibited in many public schools. The examples of misbehavior provided in the book are incredibly tame compared to what I experience on a daily basis.This book might be good for someone who has been told by a qualified mentor the s/he has not connected with the students or is too harsh."
1,Classroom circus guaranteed,"This book is only good for examples of what not to do. It tells its readers that adults should treat children as equals, that a misbehaving child's right to empowerment is more important than the other students' right to an education, and that any situation can be dealt with by calm reasoning. This approach may work with one-on-one tutoring, but it's too permissive and time-consuming for 30 students in one room. It also directly contradicts many, many studies, reports, and the opinions of experienced teachers that recommend establishing authority immediately and firmly.At every turn, the author instructs you in techniques guaranteed to have the monkeys running the zoo right in your own classroom."
3,"Heavy and spacey, what's not to like?","I will say upfront that I do like the other Novadriver release ""Void"" better (see my review), but I still like this one and have no regrets getting it. The vocals are great throughout, and the songs are done quite well. Sure, they have a formula, but please don't write them off as a Monster Magnet clone. I am a huge MM fan, and if these guys got some of their mojo from MM, then to me that's called an influence, not plagarizing. They have a fairly unique style to their sound. I think they are a lot more interesting than a lot of the other stoner-rock out there. Hopefully they will put something else out soon..."
2,It's a bore,"I knew that the Met had done this back in the late 50s. Since it is almost never heard in this country, I wanted to see if perhaps it was another great piece that got away. It isn't. It is musically uninteresting and I had no interest in following the libretto. I am not a big lover of Fledermaus; it has a few very beautiful things but it just isn't funny and has such dead weight in places. I think that Zigeuner Baron is even lesser than Fledermaus."
4,a new way to look at music,this song definatly states its set of mind on a new dimention of sound making. this is something new for everyone to enjoy!
2,This Isn't it,"Why do I have the sneaking suspicion that all of the glowing reviews posted here were written by Ms. Giordano's producers and lackeys? I believe that there could be a market for pop renditions of the great classical tunes, but this ain't it - especially when the lovely Filippa wanders precariously off pitch and slides around hoping to find the right note."
4,three impressive versions of the same song,"I bought this for the Beck remix, but I was immediately disappointed with that track. It's different, but it grew on me and I can now say that I love it. I heard Marius de Vries's mix of ""Survive"" and I hated it. I wasn't looking forward to hear his remix of ""Seven"", but it's probably the best of the three versions of the song. Both of the remixes are strangely upbeat. Beck's mix is more obscure, though. The demo version of the song sounds very similar to the album version, but it's still worth a listen."
1,Tape is WAY too thin to use...,"This stuff is so thin that it's really hard to peel off the roll. Once I got it off the roll, it never really stayed on my foot as I wanted it to."
1,"Gross, it's connected inside the toilet","I returned this product. It connects to the porcelain toilet bowl along the inside of the bowl. Use your imagination, but there was stuff on the lock that necessitated taking the lock out and scrubbing. Way too high maintenance, get a toilet lock that connects to the toilet lid and is entirely outside of the bowl."
3,Easily contaminated toilet lock,"The Mommy's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lok resides in the toilet bowl. Installation requires measurement of the height of the internal toilet bowl rim, and then choosing the snap-in plastic adapter for the approximate height of the toilet rim. Installation then requires placement of the lock in the toilet, loosely attached to and under the toilet rim. The part of the toilet lock outside of the toilet is also somewhat loose, giving the whole apparatus a flimsy feel (although the toilet seat cannot be opened more than an inch or so). While this toilet lock functions as described, cleaning the toilet bowl requires moving the toilet lock to clean the area under the toilet lock, and the toilet lock seems somewhat unsanitary. External toilet locks exist that are easy to install and more sanitary (see Safety 1st)."
1,Would not stay attached to the toilet,"We tried to install this with every different combination of spacers and latches that came with the lock, and it would not stay attached to our toilet. Luckily, Amazon has a great return policy and refunded my money (Thank you Amazon!)Next, I'm going to try theMunchkin XTRAGUARD Multi Use Latches. I'll review that when I get it."
1,Does not keep lid locked,"My son is 11 months old, and he is able to open the toilet seat while the lid lock is engaged. He lifts the toilet seat cover up, which bends the locking arm mechanism backwards so much that it loses its grip and allows the seat cover to pop open. We have a standard Toto toilet and the seat cover is flat with the angled edging surround. I am very disappointed and am looking for a replacement lid lock."
1,Worthless,"Looked good in theory, but our 10 month old pulled this off the toilet in ~ 30 secs (& yes it was installed correctly)"
5,Great for kittens and cats,"Got this product when we had a houseful of kittens we were raising. Wanted to be on the safe side since they slept in the main bathroom at night. Made sure there were no cords or hazards. I knew they probably would never be able to lift a toilet seat ,but really didn't want to take any chances. Very simple design. I also like it because it has become second nature to snap in place automatically. So, when toilet is being used for litter cleaning, we automatically close toilet back up. The babies are 5 mos. now and still just don't want them to play near a toilet. Great simple design with easy intall."
4,Works but I wish there was another way...,The lock works- almost too well as we always have to show guests how to use it. My bro-in-law breaks it off everytime. The only thing I don't like is that it has to be cleaned often and feels like it is in the way....but what are you gonna do? It's attached to a toilet- it's gonna get dirty.
3,Efficacy depends on your toilet seat,PROS:- easy to set up- not easy for baby to get thruCONS:- does not work with certain toilet seats! we have two toilets in our house and one has a larger lip. this item did not work for that toilet. double check your measurements before you purchase.
2,Doesn't work,I bought this after already having a Safety 1st lock on our upstairs toilet. Which for adults is a bit dificult to figure out which is a good thing. The toilet this was going on is a newer Kohler toilet. After adding all the included spacers the unit didnt fit close to the bowl. The lid was able to be opened a good 3 inches and with a little effort because of the play and it not fitting snug you could open the lid. Another thing is if your a germ-a-fobe this isnt a great item. We all know the guys pee with the lid and seat open and this sits in a spot where over spray can get on it and who wants that. plus having to remove it routinely to clean it. not me!!! Sent it back.
1,useless item,"Useless, don't buy it. I have twin girls and I put it on, guess what the toilet top can be open easily. Not safe for children at all!"
1,Does not fit or work no matter what I did,"This was just not a fit and I just have a standard toilet bowl. I could get it to hook under the rim, and then flip it off w/ one or two fingers, and a strong 18 month old child coud easily get around this and open the toilet lid. Save your money; I didn't return it because the shipping cost is about the price of the thing, but I don't like buying an item and then throwing it away."
5,Works perfect.,I love this one. Earlier I had one lock from Safety First and It was a real headache. That one gave up in around one year and I bought this one. Now I realize how much painful the old one was. The convenince is like 5 times better.
2,too loose,i installed it with the max number of tightness possible and you can still open the lid a good 4 inches. enough for my 16 month old to open it and stick his hand in. was definitely looking for a tight fit.
1,It broke after a month.,We liked it until our 13 month old managed to break it off the toilet completely. Before that it did its job and wasn't too difficult to use.
5,Super easy,"These locks are great. Very easy to use and best of all, you can simply take them off of your toilet and take them with you when you travel."
2,Need a flat toilet cover,"This product slips off of the curved toilet seat covers. I did not like it at ALL. Adhesive is also poor. If they are persistent or strong, babies can get into the toilet even if using this product properly."
3,toilet seat lid lock,product just as described. Good value for the money and we are very satisfied with this purchase. thank you satisfied
5,"Does what it says, could you ask for more?","The toilet lock effectively keeps my toddler from making the toilet a wading pool for his toys. Furthermore, it is simple enough that the older children can easily use the toilet.Good buy."
1,My 13-month-old broke it right off,My 13-month-old son gave the top flap a hard pull and the whole thing snapped right off. I had to fish the broken piece out of the toilet bowl. Yuck.
1,Not for oblong covers,"My son has been getting into the toilet & tossing toys in. I thought this would be a perfect solution. With the shape of my toilet, however, this item did not work. I tried using all the extenders & it never fit right. Unfortunately, I had to send it back. If you have an older toilet with a thick rim & round lid, this should work."
5,Great saftey Lid Lock,"I am so glad i bought this, its so easy to use and i feel better about having it. My 13 month old cant get it open and that was the point :)"
1,Don't waste your money....,"Title says it all. Broke in less than 2 weeks. Even before it broke, I had to install it on the very end of the toilet in order for the lid not to open far enough for a little hand and arm to go in and then you had this big thing between your legs while using the toilet. I have replaced it with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IP8RRM/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title and love these (have them on drawers and the toilet)."
5,best lock found!,"After trying many locks for our toliet, this one beats all! It is super easy to install and easy to unlock for adult use. My daughter tried to open the lid once, and hasn't tried again. I will use this product as baby shower gifts!"
5,The Best Toilet Bowl Lock!,We've tried the other locks that suctioned to the toilet and found them to fall off and be an annoyance to use. I had almost given up on locking the toilet until I saw this lock. It works great and is so easy to use - 3 months and we're still happy with it! No more worries of toys down the toilet.
3,Its Ok.....,"it seems to do the job.... but it is cheap, and kinda a pain in the butt to open... but I would def say it is child proof!!!"
2,Not worth it,"This product really doesn't work all that well. I tried using a piece of rubber material to help give the device a little more traction, but it still didn't work well. If your kid has any sort of strength they'll rip this thing right off."
2,not so great,"This fell off after about 2 weeks of use. It seems so flimsy anyway that I didn't bother to put it back on. I'm wishing I had spent a little more money and got a more secure toilet lock, because I'm going to have to end up doing that anyway..."
2,Doesn't secure the lid very well,"We just installed this product on our dual-flush toilet and you can still lift the lid about 3 inches high. I followed the directions exactly. I'm not sure if it's because our toilet is dual-flush or new or one of the types that sits higher than the normal run-of-the mill toilet. Whatever the reason, this product didn't deliver to my expectations. We bought two of these. I have a normal toilet in another bathroom and I'm going to install the second lid-lok later today. Hopefully it works on that one. If not, you'll see a second review from me."
1,FairLady,this is a piece of junk and complete waste of money. I cannot believe that they did not find anything that could keep the toilets locked for toddlers safety. It's completely useless. No its not hard to install. In fact its so silly that you have to drop your senses and install it. You can easily live without this piece of crap.
5,does the job,"this works great so far and does what it needs to do. it was a little tricky to install, as the directions are not that clear, but fiddling with it for a few min did the trick. some have complained that cleaning it will be hard as it gets icky with the toilet gunk...i have solved this by removing it when I clean the bathroom and soaking it in a 10% bleach solution. by the time I'm done, anything on it wipes off easily and it is as clean as any toilet accessory can reasonably be expected to be. my only gripe is that if you do not re-engage it each time, it is enticing for the little one to play with and could be broken by yanking the handle down. but then again, won't you be putting it back each time, isn't that the point?"
1,Did not work for us at all,"This product did not work with our toilet because of the angle of the toilet bowl. There was no way of knowing this until we took it out of the box and tried to install it. We ended up with a swing-shut toilet lock from Target instead, which would probably work for a wider variety of toilet shapes. (Who ever knew there was a variety of different bowl shapes in the first place?)"
1,Not for every toilet,"I hated this toilet latch! It did not fit tight enough on our toilet. Would not reccomend. We have a brand new toilet, so I figured it would work, not so."
1,No good,"Buy another lock. All my son did was pull up on the lid and presto...""open""! More toys down the toliet. This thing does not work!"
5,Works well,"This product does its job. After my 16 month old boy lifted up the toilet seat and put one of his toys inside, we decided to buy these. They are easy to install and easy to clean."
2,ok. but broke very easily on all 4 of our toilets,a bit of a pain to put on. worked for a short while until toilet by toilet they all started breaking apart. would try something else these just don't last.
1,These locks do not lock my toilets,"I'm not entirely sure why they don't work, I just know they don't serve their intended purpose. I fixed them to my toilets and was able to open the lid with them ""locked."" My 15 month old son could do it too. Plus, because of the design, this lock will get pretty gross, as part of the mechanism sits inside the toilet."
2,doesn't fit very well,our toilet is a gerber maxwell and this thing doesn't fit too well on it. my daughter and still open the lid. bottom line : let your kids play in the toilet germs help build immunities!!
1,The worst product EVER!!,"This is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid. It's easy enough to install but hello! What's to stop anybody, especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together? Not a thing! The ""kit"" that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it's closed, it doesn't fit snuggly around the seat so it's completely loose. Total and complete piece of junk!!!"
1,How do you get this thing off?!?!,I'm happy about my new baby brother and all but jeez! I gotta use the only toilet this house has but I don't know how to get this thing off!! Somebody please inform me on how to get this off or my bladder just might explode!
3,Average,"a little complicated to install (easy after I figured out what I was doing) We have 2 kids right now 3 years and 1 year.... the 3 year old took 5 mins to figure it out but the 1 year old hasn't quite got it yet, but sometimes if he's determined enough he can get into it, it does give us time though to stop him when he makes a dash to throw his newest treasure in the bowl. Good quality but not a perfect solution.... (my cell phone still ended up in the toilet ...enough said)"
1,one play session and it broke!,would not recommend this product. there was a huge gap between the top of the lock and my actual toilet lid (it looks flush with the lid in the pictures). the whole lock would swing around the rim of the toilet bowl rather than stay in one place. my 9 month old daughter was playing the the lid and seat (since there was such a huge gap for here to lift them up) and broke the whole thing!
1,Unsafe,"This lid lock was in use for less than one week in our home when my baby pulled on it once and it broke. The plastic hinge literally cracked and the plastic bolts fell to the floor. So not only did I have a wide open toilet that he could play in, now I had choking hazards all over the floor. I will definitely be calling this company to complain--how can they claim to keep my child safe if their product creates an additional hazard?"
4,Great product,"This is great. It attached to the toilet just fine, no problem. And my son has not been able to open the toilet since it was put on."
4,so far so good...,"It doesn't lock ""tight"" so they can still slip their fingers between the lids, and touch the seat, or below the seat, which is kind of gross to me. But we've had the lock for a couple of months now, and my 20 month old twins have yet to open the lid. So for safety purposes, it does the job, and I am satisfied."
3,It'll work for a while anyway.,"I'm buying two more of these after trying one out. It's true that its a little flimsy and a strong effort might break it, but it works so far. It's important to install it on the front and to follow the directions. Anyway, I haven't seen anything better yet."
2,Easy for toddler to figure out,This product was my last hope as the other products did not fit my toilets... but my one-year-old twins figured it out in ten seconds.
2,Not a very good solution,The mechanical design isn't clever enough to compensate for the cheap plastic's lack of stiffness. The result is that my 1.5yo can force it open by jerking the toilet seat. It doe's help a bit but you can't trust this thing to stop you child from drowning!
1,Does not do it's job!,Yes the clamp fit on my toilet seat but my son can still lift the lids and this device will just come off with it. Mommy's Helper need to make a stronger device and I'm disappointed with this deice.
4,Easy installation,"Installation for this product was really quite easy. When I first opened the package, I was a little weary of all the parts, but it turns out there are really two categories of ""extra"" parts: spacers (for the thickness of the bowl) and two other pieces (one for a taller rim, one for a shorter rim). It actually only took me about 30 seconds to install tightly so there isn't much play.I will probably order another one for another install."
5,Fantastic!,"I love this product, by far the best toilet bowl lock. I did not want to put adhesive on our lid and this option helped me not have to. It's easy to install and easy to unlock (for adult, not child). I ended up buying more."
1,Broke in 5 minutes,"my son came over, and ripped the seat up and broke this into pieces... Lasted all of 5 minutes. No thanks!"
1,Didnt like,I didnt really want this product to begin with because it sounded like a germ catcher. Product wasnt that easy to install but sits on the toilet and is kind of large. We used it for a few weeks but got rid of it. We recommend with a door handle lock instead so the child cannot get into the bathroom.
4,Better than other types,"Tried several different brands, but this one was the easiest to use and install. I would recommend this product for anyone with a small child."
3,Works well with a rubber backing,"I agree with the reviewer (Paekche) and thank her for her advice, to use a rubber backing to keep it in place. My 14 month-old was able to pull up both seats without the rubber backing. The spacers don't help much. However, this Lid-Lok works much better than the Safety 1st push-button toilet lock!"
4,works ok,"ordered 3 of these for our bathrooms and they were pretty easy to install.. no tools required. the plastic seems kind of flimsy though, not as strong as I was hoping for.However they do the job! and even father-proofed and grandma-proofed the toilets until I showed them how to open them :)"
3,"Works, but not sanitary","This latch does work and does keep my very active son out of the toilet, but it isn't very sanitary. Since it sits on the edge of the bowl it tends to get dirty when men use the toilet. We switched it out for one that mounts on top of the lid instead."
3,flimsy material,"This toilet lock comes open very easily if the seat is rattled. It keeps my daughter out long enough for me to grab her, but if left alone in the room, I think she would be able to get it open and throw things into the toilet. I would try other brands."
2,Didn't fit my toilets,Good concept but my 1 year old was able to slide the lock around on the side of the toilet (even though I used all the spacers) and was able to access the toilet water by partially lifting the lid. Disappointing.
4,Good product for not a lot of money,"Just follow the installation instructions, and this is a very good product that works well. And it didn't cost a lot."
3,wished had fit better,"Installed ok, but fit is not tight enough. The toilet lid can still be lifted 1-2 inches before it hits the arm of the clamp, which is enough for my 1 year old to cram baby blocks and other small items though. At least he cannot fully lift the lid, so it does keep him from falling in."
2,Did not work for us,We tried to use this but it would not hold properly on the toilet edge. A waste of money from our standpoint.
1,Didn't work!,"This product was a waste of money -my kitten still shredded the toilet paper she just wasn't able to have the entire roll unravel. But it was so shredded, it still left the roll unuseable.....so I give this product an F"
3,"It works, but it's a pain.","This gadget does work to keep my toddler from unrolling the entire roll of tp, but it's a bit of a pain to take on and off. It's not a big hassle until 2am when my pregnant self is up hitting the restroon for the 3rd time in 5 hours. We stopped using it and just close the bathroom door to keep the toddler out instead."
3,Unadult-friendly,We got this to baby proof our bathrooms. It does the job of keeping TP in place but it's so annoying for adults! So we've taken it off our master bathroom and just put our TP up on the toilet tank. The guest bathroom still has it in place. Sorry to our guests for having to deal with this TP saver.Baby and pet proof - yes.Adult proof - unfortunately yes.I don't recommend. Maybe if you look harder you can find something better.
1,Not standard fitting as noted.,"I was disappointed when the product arrived and opened to learn that it was not standard fitting and was more of a nuisance to use than expected. Who wants to take off the roll of tp each time you have to eliminate, you could just not use a holder and place it next to the commode. It was a waste of money and through it away in the garabage, instead to keep my puppy outta the destruction of tp roll, I bought a suction cup and a round basket and put it on the tile wall just above the original tp holding structure. Problem solved !"
3,Very Tasty Treat,"For as long as I remember, I've loved Joray fruit rolls. Back in the seventies, they only came in Apricot flavor. Now they're in a variety of flavors. In my opinion, the cherry flavor is very tasty, but not quite as flavorful as the others. Grape is still my personal favorite."
3,A Change In Direction For Placebo,"Brian Molko is a pretty poster boy, he wears make-up, he's got star quality. While certainly Placebo are not one of those bands who can lead the trend. Like their precedent David Bowie, they can follow the trend closely. So it is no surprise that this single sounds different from the last album. While Brian said this is experimental, it still has its commerical accessiblity. They are Placebo after all, how experimental can they be? Say hi to Steve Reich or Aphex Twin? Not in the foreseen future, they still wanna make money after all. Good tune, good production, no harm checking this out."
3,A Decent Come Back,"Placebo return with their first new material in just under a year. Although ""Taste in Men"" is by no means as good as their last comeback single ""Pure Morning"" there is still a fair bit to be applauded here. The groovy bassline is really good and the lyrics have that sexually suggestive quality that so many Placebo fans have got used too.While certainly a song that grows on you, ""Taste in Men"" is still in many ways a bit dissapointing. The song veers perilously close to industrial music and sounds in many ways more like Limp Bizkit than classic Placebo.Brian Molko has indeed acknowledged that this is by far the most experimental track on their new album ""Black Market Music"" and I commend the fact that they had the guts to release such an uncommercial song as a first single. Still the fact remains that although ""Taste in Men"" is quite good it is certainly not going to rank anywhere close to a lot of Placebo's other work.The bass is very ""Block Rock N' Beats"" too."
4,an excellent exegetical guide for Colossians!,"I've gathered commentaries of Colossians and Ephesians to write about an book myself from a Greek exegetical point of view. I should've known this is not a commentary but a guide for a biblical Greek learner in the first place.But the author recommend a lot of books for the future reference and I find them to be very exhaustive bibliography. Along with this book, of course, I've obtained more precise commentaries. This could give you a quick going over before you go about reading thicker commentaries."
5,Wonderful book on writing!,"A delightful book on writing which substantially raises the bar for all works in this field. It teaches, motivates, elevates, and entertains students. When I look at the sorry state of ""approved"" books in this subject and compare it to Mr. Frank's masterpiece, I feel we teachers need to cast our votes strongly in Mr. Frank's camp. Students cannot help but be inspired to write--and write well--with a text like this."
5,This book is by my Teacher,"Okay, you may not belive me , but Mr. frank was my sixth grade teacher. This was his first book and it took him ten yars to complete, it payed off well. This book is great for school students and even if your not one, you should still by this book NOW! If you read this review , Mr. STEVEN Frank it's comming from the kid Director in 7th grade."
5,Easy to install.,I replaced a broken base on my boat with this one. It matched up perfectly with the orriginal including the screw holes.
1,Marvelous Mouth Music,As a speech pathologist I was expecting a little more creativity and instruction with this CD. I wish there had been more information on the musculature being exercised. The songs did not have substantial repition to facilitate any type of motor control. I was sorry I purchased this item. Next time I'll look to ASHA for suggestions
1,Lisa-mother of Apraxic boy,"My son hated this, he screamed until I turned it off in the car. My other children just said, ""What is this?"". Each child is different, I hope it helps someone else."
5,Great fun!,"I don't know if this is helping my son, just from listening to it, but we all enjoy the catchy, fun songs...We haven't looked at the information that goes with it the way that we should."
5,Good African material!,I liked this book because it took me to a far away land with lots of wild animals and gave me a look at the land and food they ate. I liked the bright colors and the stormy weather. I think the tree made a mistake complaining so much to the Great Spirit of the Wild Plains. He was ok. with all his leaves and was really big. He should have been happy the way he was! I hope I can see more books like this one.
2,Where was it made?,"Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say ""USA"" near the top, and they are great pens. However, I have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back to Cross for warranty repair under their ""lifetime guarantee,"" only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a ""handling fee"" attached.I was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when some new colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect.My advice: if you want a good Cross pen, go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in USA. They aren't making them the same anymore."
4,Cross Pen/Pencil set,"I always enjoy using cross pens. This set I purchased for my good friend at work, I am satisfied with the pen, it works as promised, however I am not satisfied with the new system (the cartridge) in the pencil. All it is, is a regular pen body, and it requires to put in the pencil cartridge. When the cartridge is inserted, it does not appear properly at the tip of the pen and trying to advance the lead is very difficult and requires rotations before it comes out."
2,Quality has fallen,"The pen was fine, but the pencil is not really a pencil but another pen with the pen refill replaced with a pencil filler. The parts don't fit together well and it is hard to keep the pencil lead from retracting when writing.A true cross pencil is solid black at the cap, but this one has a chrome center, indicating it started out as a pen.I recently bought a gold cross pencil from someone else who told me it was one of the last made in America--that one was perfect. This pencil, made overseas, is a definite drop in quality."
4,Nice pair of pens,They are very thin and I like more bigger that is why I dont rate 5 stars but there are good quality and meet all My spectations from a Cross Pen
4,madmarine1981,I needed a set of good writting instruments and I wanted something that would look good with my work uniform. This pen writes very smooth and I have received alot of comments from my superiors on how professional they look. Awesome buy for the price.
4,It's a good pen pencil set. Maybe a little overpriced.,I own this set and I think its fine. I like the fact its less weight. It's not as bad as everyone says it is. I got mine on ebay for a really cheap price. But I got lucky. So for the price I paid I give it 5 stars.
1,Not what I ordered!!,"I ordered a plain chrome Cross Pen & Pencil set as a Christmas gift and received a set with the Caterpiller company logo stuck on the pen and pencil. I ordered this set as a gift and I certainly did not want to give a gift from an ad campaign for Caterpiller. The set was shipped from All Medial One, Inc. and did not include a return shipping label. Instead they sent me an email contact address. Haven't heard from then yet. I sure hope I get my money back before Christmas so I can buy another pen & pencil set locally."
1,Worthless. Umbrella does not reflect light.,"This kit is worthless. The umbrella is made of a very cheap material. It literally does not reflect light. No matter what type of bulb/power you use, the light that hits the umbrella simply passes through the cheap material. Moral of the story. You get what you pay for. Returning to Amazon immediately."
4,Not bad,Good value for your money. Not to use a main source of light. Good for back light or side light.
2,Light was broken,"After opening the box I realized that the fluorescent light that it came with was broken. Packaging was terrible and did not suit fragile objects. Everything else was fine, but it's kinda hard to use an umbrella light without the light."
2,"OK product (arrived broken), but customer service is AWFUL","This product works as well as expected for the money. It is good for a little fill light-- what I needed for a recent product shoot. Light stand is very, very flimsy and cheap.Customer service from the seller is AWFUL. The light stand arrived broken and rusted (obviously a used product, even though it was advertised as ""new""), I sent them an email, they replied almost two weeks later and said they would have to file a claim with the shipper (which is ridiculous, considering the packaging was sound-- obviously they sent me a bum light stand. I've not heard anything since, nor have I received a replacement light stand.I would not recommend buying from this seller."
4,Good value for $50!,"Nice, simple and adjustable light. Not heavy-duty/pro construction, but good for a small home studio."
5,Great Umbrella Light Kit for the Price!,"I have to say that I was slightly skeptical of this product before I ordered it. The reviews seem mixed and the price on it was pretty inexpensive, but I went ahead and ordered it and I am SO glad that I did. The Umbrella Light Kit arrived in about a week and it is a well-made product that was easy to put together. The only downside is the free bulb that is included is way too dim to take pictures with, so I just ordered 2 new photo bulbs. Other than that minor thing, it's great for a home studio where you need some extra lighting. It even includes a handy on/off switch so that you don't have to unplug it from the wall everytime."
3,Lighting Umbrella,"Although eventually got it to work on my own, there were no instructions included for the product. Frustrating and caused communications to the company, who eventually corrected the YouTube instructions.The most important part of this review is the way in which Steve Kaeser & Co. handled my complaint and previous rating. There was eventually rectification of the problem and a very generous offer for my trouble. This company and it's representatives really know how to maintain customer loyalty.Thanks to Alex for the follow-up and to Steve for approving a resolution."
3,Good for a fill light,"I was hoping that if I liked this light I could buy another for a fill light and be done with it. Sadly, it's just not bright enough to be the primary light source; at least not with the bulb it comes with. Maybe if I replaced the bulb with something higher wattage it would be OK. I'll still use it as a fill light, but am going to buy a different light to be my primary. It just didn't make enough of a difference. For an inexpensive light the quality is fine, though- I didn't have any problems with the quality, though it would have been nice to include instructions."
4,Lighting Kit,"It is a light weight stand and easily portable. The lights are a little small, but usable. I am using 65 watt bulbs in it for shooting most of the time. The small bulbs are great for shooting small objects up close."
3,Fair,"For the price, you get a decent product , you might need another umbrella, but like I said for the price you can't bet it."
3,"OK, but looks cheaply built. You get what you pay for.","This is not a bad product, but beware. I bought from Fancier Studio, and it was actually from and cheaper from Ephoto, only seen after receipt. Materials used not very sturdy, has a cheap look."
4,As inexpensive as lighting gets,"Works well for me, and you cannot beat the price. If you are starting out, you might as well get the feel for studio lighting at low cost before you dump a few hundred into an industrial-strength kit. I do commercial food and merchandise photography, much of it close ups, and cannot find anything negative about this unit. I'm putting the savings into other gear."
2,You Get What You Pay For...,"The stand is very light weight and made cheap, the umbrella is better used as a prop and the light isn't as bright as the CPL Daylight blub I brought from Walmart and use in my table lamps at home.I bought two of these and use them for a little extra fill light as needed. I do not use the umbrella for anything other than props. I purchased (2) CowboyStudio 33 inch Black and Silver Photo Studio Reflective Umbrella's and use them instead."
5,Great buy!,This light met and exceeded my expectations! I would recommend it for photographers and artists needing an soft natural light source.
3,Good light but not enough!,"This is a good light, but I found it slightly weak and not bright enough to be used as a single light source for portrait photography. Probably would need another similar kit to lighten up the subject"
1,damaged on arrival,"product was damaged upon arrival...I have not been able to get ahold of the company to return the product....co. has not returned any of my several emails. extremely dissatified, problem has yet to be solved....would not do further business with them. would not reccomend this co."
4,Photography Studio Light,"The Photography studio light is easy to use and put together. It is also easy to transport when going on events that may need lighting. I am not a professional photographer, I am a make-up artist who needed a light for a studio and also to take with me on jobs and it does the trick."
4,Great product,I was very pleased with the lights & reflectors. The price was incredibly low. Arrived on time & in good condition. Will use IGgFactory Inc again.
4,Great in lit rooms,"This is a great idea, for a cheaper version of a softbox or just as extra lighting. It works best in an already lit room to help add shadow and depth to a photo, however without any other lighting it doesn't do too much. I do like it though and it has been useful to me in several different circumstances. The stand can double as a camera stand but does not rotate."
4,Good Product,"I haven't used this umbrella light but a few times so far, and when I did use it, it worked very well. Would definitely recommend to a friend."
2,Didn't provide enough light for my needs,"I purchased this item to provide additional lighting for photographing items for eBay (had just been using a clamp light with a metal shade). It did not provide anywhere near the amount I was hoping for. I tried a brighter light bulb than the one provided, and that was a slight improvement--but still not enough to be adequate for my needs. I will probably still use it, but without the umbrella. The stand is a little flimsy, but I wasn't expecting much for the price."
1,Came in dead!!!,Product not working upon arrival. used 2 different light bulbs and still not working. i was looking forward for this product so i can play around with it but i guess ill just have to buy a different one. Product made in China so theres 60% chance that yours might come broken too!!
1,god,"""Gucci Mane"" might be the least talented rap artist I have heard in my entire life. After hearing the song ""Freaky Girl,"" I couldn't help but laugh. His lyrics contain nothing even remotely meaningful and his beats are unoriginal and monotonous. I cannot beleive anyone would give this album above a 1 or 2. My little sister could come out with a better album than this clown."
5,The Ultimate Roy Rogers Collection Book,Ron has done an impressive job with this book.I think what I enjoyed the most is the rarer Roy rogers toys many of which have never been seen in any other books on Roy.My favorite is the guns and holsters section which pictures many unique sets.This book is a fine addition to the library of a collector or dealer in Roy rogers collectibles.
1,A dissatisfied customer!,I received a cheap laminated chart that a third grader could have made. What a rip-off!!!
1,Horrible,"This is perhaps the worst live performace ever recorded by a metal band.Where to start - I guess the first thing that sticks out to me is the poor sound of the band live. While on recorded CDs they are amazing and have some great songs, when performed live, it lacks any cohesion. The vocals - from either singer, sound bad. The live mix is muddled too.The worst part for me, however, is the show. The song selection was lacking and it appears they performed before a crowd that was there to see someone else. The club, which may have 100 people at the show max, aren't into any of the songs and just appear to be waiting for some other band.The extras are lame as well. The biography of the band is nothing more than text - no video talking about the band's history.I own almost 100 metal DVDs and this is by-far the worst. Purchase at your own risk!"
1,Misleading if not fraudulent,"This particular listing doesn't tell what size the product is, but they want you to believe it's the 6 oz. cream. They say the list price is $135.99, which is the list for the 6 oz. I think I can barely see from the picture that it is the 1.5 oz. size. I believe this company is doing this on purpose, i.e. fraudulently, while they have other listings on Amazon at other prices w/ descriptions of the product."
5,Another success!,"This is our 3rd Tanglefoot CD and they just keep getting better! We heard them, once again, live in Bowling Green, OH in 2008 and made a beeline for amazon.com to see their latest releases. Their songs are a mix of touching, invigorating, and humorous. Strong voices and great instrumentation blend for success. Not to be missed!"
5,Dried Flowers For All Seasons book by Jan and Michael Gertley,"Great book with a lot of information and pictures. Part one Chapters include: Plants to grow, Drying Techniques including air-drying, using dessicants, glycerin, and storing dried flowers. Part Two has Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter dried arrangements. Part Three is a plant guide arranged alphabetically with pictures, including growing, harvesting, and drying information."
4,A good book to learn the techniques,"I like the book. It gives detailed explanation on how to dry flowers. I feel I received enough info to start the hard work. I especially love the plant guide section where it shows the picture of each plant and explains how each of them should be treated. What disappointed me in this book is that the author recommends to use the floral paint to revive the color of the flowers. To me this makes the flowers look artificial. I would like to know which flowers could be dried to preserve a good enough color to avoid the paint. I would, also want to see more flower arrangement recipes that I could readily use. Overall, the book is a good resource and is worth buying."
4,"The Life of Christina Wilson, a Coal Camp Girl","This book is worth reading! I read this, and was absolutely amazed with the content, and how it described the appalling life in a coal camp. Tina Wilson lives in the Linden Mine Coal Camp. The book describes Tina's life at the camp, including some happy memories, and some tragedies. If you are a fan of Little House On The Prarie, read this book today!"
1,I couldn't have been more disappointed,"Spend your money on one of Leary's performances, not this painfully unfunny waste of 90 minutes. If you've ever watched a comedian struggle mightily to be funny and fail, you know the sort of discomfort I felt when watching these no-names flail on stage. It's telling that the only names of consequence--Stewart and Leary's cousin O'Brien--literally phoned it in. A typically awkward detail: the director cuts away to Keifer Sutherland reaction shots maybe a dozen times, like he's the President at the Lincoln Center Honors or something. It's utterly bizarre. Leary deserved better. I spent the whole time wishing I were watching him do standup--instead of watching him watch his inferiors. His brief closing remarks are amusing enough, but it's too little too late."
1,Save your money,"After watching several of the other Comedy Central Roasts, it is easy to say that this one comes in dead last in all aspects. It's hard to describe how unfunny this one was, other than to say that it was a good idea for Comedy Central to add more comedians in later episodes. Basically, most of the people seemed to be there just to hang out and half-ass tease him. There was no energy from any of the roasters, the jokes were completely flat and pointless, the song was hard to hear and wasn't funny either, and the roastmaster himself made a few lame attempts at jokes but mainly just offered praise for everyone that came up to talk. A roast, this was not. Maybe casual banter peppered with a few meaningless and random personal stories. Thank God for Netflix because I didn't have to feel bad about stopping it before it was done."
1,Bambi and Thumper Could Have Handled This Roast,"This may be a keeper for the hard-core Denis Leary fans but for those of us who enjoy the Comedy Central roasts as a whole...to say that this was disappointing is a gross understatement. There were a few good jokes here and there but they were few and far between. Unlike the the typical CC dayus members, Greg Giraldo, Jeff Ross, Lisa Lampanelli, the roasters didn't really let Denis Leary ""have it"". Personally, I think it was because the majority are all still trying to make it in the film industry and feared that any derogatory remarks towards anyone in the room may have had repercussions down the road. Once again, that's just my opinion. Overall, I think Denis Leary not only deserved a much better roast...we all know he could handle it! What I wouldn't give to have ""The Queen of Mean"" (Lisa L.) up there for just two minutes..."
5,Dennis Leary does it again!!,Dennis leary at his best. This is the best comedy DVD ever. If you like Dennis Leary you will love this DVD!!
3,Too Expensive,"NOt that much on the DVD, totally not worth the price even with it being bundled with the stand up DVD."
1,Denis Leary STOLE EVERYTHING from BILL HICKS,"This roast has some amusing moments, but no one had the balls to confront Denis about the fact that he lifted the majority of his act from Bill Hicks. His entire ""angry smoking guy"" shtick was lifted from Bill and Denis Leary should be ASHAMED OF HIMSELF. Besides, what kind of an ego does this guy have to PRODUCE a roast of himself? Do yourself a favor and don't buy this DVD. Go buy any of Bill Hicks' CDs from Amazon. They are all very good (except Philosophy, which is more of a disjointed greatest hits package) and they are all much better than Denis Leary will ever be."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Shockwaver Rider is a cyberpunk precursor style of book, written before there were even personal computers, Brunner comes up with a very extensive multi-user system that everyone is connected to.That is obviously open to abuse, and a talented rebel sets out to do something about what is happening."
2,Prescient but dated,"Although I can certainly understand the appeal of this groudbreaking precambrian cyberpunk novel, the story and language are hopelessly dated to a modern reader. In a way the book reminded me of an Ayn Rand novel; good ideas stuck between pages upon pages of confusing and ridiculous dialog spewed by one-dimensional characters."
1,May well be the WORST book I've ever read,"Although Brunner foresees the influence of a national ""datanet"" and the book sports a sort of hacker/phreaker hero, you can tell the author quickly made the story up as he went along. The plot is so disjointed and utterly contrived, it seems to be the work of an 11 yr old. Throughout, Brunner tries to impart deep social truths which are mostly just half-baked, thoughtless whimsy. I knew I shouldn't have read the whole book - It really was a complete waste of my time."
5,gotta add my two cents,"This is Peter Tosh in his prime. After he justifiably quit the Wailers and before he became too involved with Jamaican gangsters.I don`t know who is in the band. Thanks to no info on MP3,but this a fantastic live performance of a rock classic.I`m sure Chuck Berry has heard many covers of Johnny B.Goode, but nothing even close to this unique interpretation"
3,Where are all the Photos?,"For a man that Ran so many business's,Heck even rode with Sonny Barger and The Hells Angels,lived in a cave house,had friends who had their own canyons,was a player at all the legendery casions. there is not one picture!weird really? So then does this amount to a fictional account at Best?. You would think that for all the interesting people he met-places he has been-there would atleast a couple of cool shots?"
5,Great Collection of Memories of Trying to Make It While LV Grew Up,"I bought the book & met the author at a book signing. I kept it in my ""back pocket"" because it can read as either a compilation of fascinating short stories about early Vegas; or as a can't-put-it-down chronology of an entrepreneur trying to make a living in a rapidly growing, unique city."
4,Works fine.,"Works fine, as advertised. No problems. Anybody know how to get the Cross pencils to work though? I can't figure out how to refill them for the life of me."
1,"Just throw away the pen, don't buy these refills","I have bought a few of these and every one of them is next to impossible to write with. I have no idea what the problem might be or why something that appears so simple is almost completely useless. Might as well throw away your pen. Would have bought in a ""regular"" store if I could have found them and returned, but with the hassle, time, and cost to return it after purchasing online doesn't make sense."
1,Product was never received.,"I ordered a Cross ballpoint pen and the refills to accompany it. The pen arrived, but the refills were never received. Since I had ordered several things from Amazon on the same day, I carefully re-examined each shipping envelope to no avail."
5,The best refills,"I wish they held more ink, but these medium points have a nice, bold line. Cross pens are the best."
4,Not bad!,"This video isn't that bad at all. It starts out with a really hot chick on a Harly and get's pretty intimate on it with her lover. Just about all the girls in this video are hot and really put on a good show. The best part of this video is towards the end though. A really hot chick with huge Hooters gets wild in a theater. It's worth buying just to see that scene. I was dissapointed though with the fact these girls were only in uniform for a little intro before their video. I don't know about you, but those Hooter's outfits are hot and I sure would like to see them strip down in them!"
1,Does NOT fit Dr. Grip Center of Gravity,"Maybe by the time you're reading this, the seller will have updated the description by removing the Dr. Grip Center of Gravity from the list of pens this refill is meant to fit. Either way, upon writing this review, it was still there. It does not fit. Not even close. Please see the picture I uploaded."
2,Ridiculously expensive,"I love the pens and have bought the refills before, but this price is ridiculous. The pens can be bought at $9 for a box of 12 (75 cents each) on Amazon. These refills are $1.25 each. I can't really understand the math."
3,"Writing is great, but did not quite fit my pen","Good news first - man, I love these points! Superfine, flows easy, clear crisp lines. No sticking, mess, clogging with crud, etc.Bad news - got them to refill my Army Skilcraft pen and they don't quite fit, had to file down the little spring-holder plastic stuff to get the clicker to work smoothly.So, for 2 bucks for 2 refills and 5 minutes of my time, I can keep using my favorite pen for another 6-12 months or however long these last!Since you're reading this review, and hunting for cheap-ass pen refills, you too have a mild case of OCD with your pen, otherwise you'd just chuck your 45 cent pen and use the free one your kid collected at the fun fair last month. This is a pretty good product, and if I don't find something that fits perfectly before I run out of ink, I'll buy another set of these."
4,Replaces my old one,I love this pen. I have owned two of them previously and couldn't get along without having one for work so I purchased this new one. I love the grip on this pen! It has a very comfortable grip! I tend to grip everything in a death grip so my fingers hurt when I write but I can hold this longer. They also have a purple pen which I love so I bought it in this color. A great pen and I think this is a great buy. A little expensive for a pen but the other two pens have lasted for years.
4,okay,Took a long time for them to mail the pens to me - roughly more than two weeks. I bought other stuff after this but received them a week ahead of the pens. But the pens are okay so far.
5,jean jacket,Very happy sent it to our French exchange student & his wife for their first child. They were very happy
3,Just OK,"I am not a professional chef, but I am an avid cook and I found this knife set to be a bit disappointing. I purchased it with hopes of getting a good set of Henckels knives with a longwearing stainless steel handle. Instead, these knives feel VERY light, the shape is hard to handle for fast chopping or dicing, and the handles frankly just feel strange in your hand (they have a sort of a sandpaper texture.) I would only recommend these knives for someone who prefers beauty to function- they are attractive in the block on the counter. In my house, however, they never leave the block."
1,don't be fooled!,"These are NOT the german henckles - they are made in Japan and don't even compare to the german or even spain henckles. I am returning this product as i don't find it worth even the $49. I certainly don't know any stores that would sell this for the $247 or whatever they said the ""retail"" price was. The block was also dissapointing, it looked plastic. This makes me nervous to buy other amazon products that are at ""sharp"" discounts in the kitchen section..."
2,Henkels Knives,"Dh bought these for Christmas, 2005. WOW, they are SHARP! Just weeks later, they had already dulled immensely and need to be resharped. I washed and dried them immediately, as advised, but I still have some rust already, less than a year. When I find my reciept, they go back!!amberDenver"
3,I expected more,"These knives looked much better on the picture than when I got them. They are nice and sharp but not as heavy or as nice as I expected from Henckels. But then again they are the International version which is the ONE GUY thingie and not as nice! They are also Stamped steel if you care that they are forged or not.They are light weight and look great, so if you like knives that are not too heavy in your hand then these are the ones for you. I like a heavy handle and more weight so that it feels substantial in your hand and not like a 5 dollar knife, So all in all it's ""You get what you pay for"""
2,Not Even Close,"I bought these knives back in November of 2005. While they've held up, they dulled very quickly. I've tried multiple knife sharpeners and none of them will keep these knives sharp. Even the sharpener that's included with the set doesn't work well. I paid ~ $130 for them and in my opinion they aren't even close to being worth that. My suggestion is to invest in a better set of knives...one's you can actually sharpen."
5,Perfect knives...,"This knive is made for chefs (I cook every day)... the light handle with most of the weight in the blade make for quick chopping. The blade slices though meats and veggies with ease. There are no wield marks or a protruding handle, the blade and handle seem to be one piece of steel... thus making it easy to clean and dry.Phenomenal set for the price... I would've paid more."
5,Excellent book,"This book, in a very easy to read foremat, explains how ridiculous it is to think that the puppets were just haphazardly made by chance. It mirrors the story of creation and how just as ridiculous it is to think that human beings were just formed out of some big glob or something. It really gives credence to the idea of a master Creator. I loved the book. A great one for children and adults alike."
3,"Fun, but unrealised potential","As a PSP fan and bike enthusiast I was hoping this would bring my passions together. However, while its certainly quite entertaining, it doesn't get the heart beating faster. For example, with 'brake assist' turned on (a requirement to get used to the game) it becomes easy to the point of monotony and doesn't do justice to the PSP platform; with this feature turned off, it becomes outrageously hard. It feels like this is a 'version 1' to test out what the playing-public like. If that were the case, I'd be prepared to take a chance on the next release. I don't regard my money buying this as wasted, but I'd recommend buying second-hand (as I did) in order to feel like you're get good value."
2,Hard to control the bikes,"Previously I played Moto GP on my Sanyo cell phone for Sprint, and although it was crude it was fun. The PSP version, unfortunately, is very difficult to play because it's impossible to control the bikes. Even when the speedometer says 100 mph, the game feels slow. Recently I played Burnout Legends and Need for Speed Carbon on the PSP and the framerate of these two games was just great -- you'd feel like driving fast even at 80 mph. Moto GP sucks."
5,Yes! Great for every day and it works,I have changed the way I manage my store and have seen immediate results! A great buy! I would recommend anyone in a service industry read this book.
1,returned,The strainer came with a large pull in the mesh. I Sent back it immediately I was going to give as a gift but decided to look elsewhere as you can see per other reviews it seems whatever quality control measures they have in manufacture this are not existant.
3,"Nice look, but...","This is aesthetically a nice unit, a good size for many uses, but... The mesh seems improperly supported, attached to the hoop that holds it. Since I'm aware of these sorts of things I will be careful, but it seems that the mesh would easily pull out of the hoop or ring with a bit of inattention or straining something heavy."
1,Good...until the rivets snap,"I was happy with the performance of the strainer...easy to clean, fit well over the edges of pans, etc. But only a month after I received it, the handle snapped right off. I was draining a can of vegetables, so it doesn't seem to me that was overdoing it. I'll definitely check the fastenings on the next strainer I buy."
2,Overpriced and weak handle,I was disappointed at how weak the handle was considering how beefy it looks in the picture. The problem is that the flat metal piece of meatal between the thick handle and ring is just too thin. Straining a full load would cause the whole basket to sag to the point where I thought the spot weld were going to break. My old plastic handle strainer deflected less than this metal one. You can see why I would be disappointed considering this is an expensive strainer.The spot welds that attach the handle to the steel ring also look very weak. I can see why the last reviewer's handle broke.The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is because it does look nice. But all show and no-go doesn't cut it in my kitchen.
1,Poorly Made Handle,"Although at first glance this strainer appears well-made, the handle broke off the first time I used it. I was using it to make gravy and don't think I put undue strain on it. Amazon was great and there was no problem returning it for a full refund with prepaid return shipping, but I will be looking for a better made strainer. This food strainer is not worth the price."
1,CHEAPLY MADE,"The strainer part works fine. The only problem is the first time I used this strainer, the handle fell off. Cheaply made. Not worth the money. It wasn't worth a dollar, much less whatever I paid for the thing. I would not recommend this product to anyone!"
3,not a John Coffin,"I am a fan of Ms.Butler's John Coffin novels; however, I was disappointed in this book. I might follow the others in this series if I can find them in the library, but I would not buy another one to keep. The end ""surprise"" was obvious early on. The characters were not up to the Coffin standard. I did not think the story moved all that well either. I was expecting more action and better background information on the main characters. It was an effort to finish it. I will donate this to my local Friends of the Library rather than keep it in my personal library."
2,Clunky,"I wanted to like this book because of its setting and the author (she's a favorite of mine); but the book was disappointing. The writing was of the ""See Spot. See Spot run. Run, Spot, run,"" type. I'm donating it to the local book sale.Bunty"
2,Received damaged,"I received the 2X Barlow with 2 chips on the lens and some glue residue showing around the perimeter. I didn't even try it to check the optical quality, just packed it up and sent it back. Orion was very prompt in issuing a refund. Looking at it, it just looked like cheap construction for something costing $93. However, I was happy with the prompt refund through Amazon, although in the end it cost me to ship a defective product back. Now, I am reluctant to buy any eyepieces or Barlows from Orion, although I am still considering an Orion telescope."
5,"A ""Must-have""","If you only own ONE Blodwyn Pig album (and that would be a crime), this is it. Perfect studio versions of ""See My Way"" and ""Dear Jill"", among others- and some very well-mastered live recordings go into this compilation. If you can't find a disc to purchase, download the tracks."
5,Awsome Comedy!,"Great comedy. Giraldo is funny and quick witted. He produces a steady stream of great jokes that don't let up. At no point do you find it boring or want it to end. In addition, while he comments on familiar topics you don't get the ""been there, done that"" feeling. He delivers old ideas in a unique (an vulgar) way. Good job Greg!"
5,Funny Guy You May Not Have Heard About,"For some reason, most people don't know Greg Giraldo and I don't know why because he is very funny. I happened to stumble upon a clip of his on YouTube and couldn't stop laughing. A quick hop over to Amazon and I ordered this CD, which is hilarious. He's so funny!!!The little bit of audio samples available here don't do his act justice. If you want to get your feet wet, do a search for Greg on YouTube. Then while you are still laughing, come back to Amazon and order his CD. Enjoy!"
2,nightclub dance...,Nightclub Dance Series: Sexy Moves For The ClubI received it on time but it wasn't good as I expected...
3,It's ok...,"It was ok, the dance moves seemed relatively easy.. I guess for someone knowing how to dance and at least stay on beat this DvD seemed elementary, but it's good..."
3,satisfactory dvd,"I orderded this dvd, and overall im satatisfied with it. Some of the dance moves were really cute and flirty, however most of these moves looked ridiculous,would not do in public or i either, already knew how to do.the instructor really breaks down each step which is helpful, and you have the choice to choose which dancers' style you'd like to copy.so if your looking for a dance dvd with some interesting moves, this is for you"
4,Another almost five stars except that..,I also bought this DVD when I purchased Girls Night Out from their Nightclub Dance Series.Again.. Great instructer.. She's got a way of making you feel really comfortable and that you can make these moves your own and not make a fool of yourself..but again.. same problem I had with the other DVDthe dancer to the instructor's left (my right) she was too distracting because she moved like she didn't know what she was doing.. If she wasn't on the DVD.. it would be a great but..I wish they would have switched up the music.. Having it be the same throughout was a bit boring..Still great DVD and worth the money you'll spend on it..
4,Level 80 Paladin,"Being a 65 year old man it is difficult for me to pick up beautiful women. But after learning these sexy moves, suddenly level 80 neck-beard is rolling in poon. So before you buy this ask yourself. ""Can I handle all of that sex?"""
4,VERY HELPFUL!,This sexy moves really helps when it comes to learning about dance moves for the clubs. It's not that typical couple dancing moves it's dances that you can do by yourself and look great and sexy. I recommend it for anyone sizes small and large. Youll look great and have fun at the same time.
4,Great Instruction! Easy to follow!,"I was pleasantly surprised by how well I liked this DVD! The instructor broke things down at a pace that lets you to comfortably learn the moves before they move on. Also, there is a wide range of moves to learn."
5,The best dance DVD for ladies,I REALLY loved this DVD. All the moves were very sexy and relatively easy to do. The instructor broke each move down for you and the moves were very creative and fun. This is by far my favorite of the two DVDs. I would definitely buy again!!!
5,One of the Best learn to dance DVD's,"This was one of the best learn to dance DVD's I have ever purchased and there have been many. The instructor teaches at a good pace (not too slow not to fast) and the moves are up to date. I particularly like the fat burning workout which puts all the moves together, so that you can practice. I definitely will be purchasing Girls Night Out. I can finally say ""I can dance"" and that's an awesome feeling."
3,Good Workout!,"This video is fun and is a great way to workout. The only problem is it helps if you have some type of dancing background. They start you off slow but then speed up, it was hard for me to keep up, but as long as you're willing to practice you will be able to do it."
5,Great DVD...,"She breaks down the moves really well, very easy to learn them. Finally I understand how to booty bounce! Some are a bit silly and I would never use at a club but the majority I will. There enough moves that I couldn't learn all of them in one session, so defiantly worth the buy."
5,Simply amazing!,"I absolutely loved this video! Some of the moves are a little intense, and I would never try outside my room. A few you would have to completely perfect or you would look pretty dumb at the club. However, most of the moves are completely sensible, and all of them are sexy. I especially loved the 15 minute workout program; it's perfect for both practice and exercise. I have a lot more confidence now, and my legs have toned up. Haha but what's up with the girl on the right? She's a hoot to watch. She can't keep up with the other two girls."
3,not as good as I expected,"From the reviews I thought this was going to be wonderful!and maybe it is because I am not American? But I did NOT find the moves sexy.things I liked: it was definitely aimed at night club dancers, the girls were in heels, and the moves were on the spot, simple walking, stuff that you CAN do when you are out dancing- I liked some of the arm stuff, as it can be hard to know what to do with your armsThings I didn't like- the moves didn't seem sexy to me!- the music I did not like (it was very repetitive)So on the whole I wasn't that impressed.BUT if you go out and don't know what to do, this could be a good starting point. Or even just something to give you ideas for what you could try next."
5,"A ""must"" for BVSC fans and Cuban music enthusiasts!","Buena Vista Social Club is more a coffee table addition than a serious in-depth study, but will prove a 'must' for any prior fan of the Buena Vista Social Club and Cuban music in particular. Photos, film stills and text accompany first-person capsule sketches by the participants of the BVSC group in this companion book to the film."
5,Great Video for any drummer...,"This video set is awesome! You learn so much about the Liquid Tension Experiment and Dream Theater drum music. Mike Portnoy breaks down all of the difficult aspects of the songs. All very interesting stuff. But only get the tapes if you wanna learn somthing. If not you can get bored. But the live footage is cool too. This is worth your money kids, trust me"
4,Excelent for Drumers and anyone who likes progressive,"I liked it a lot and enjoyed it very much.The four stars are because on a personal level, I was expecting a little more about the notes Mike takes when writing a song at the studio along with the other musicians, and that is why I was expecting a little more on how do they do it, how does Mike do it.I recomend this DVD very much, its very entertaining and it does has some very interesting tips and solos. I like a lot the different angle views. If you like drums and progressive music, you have to buy it."
5,"Fun to watch, but nothing to learn.","I really enjoyed watch this video set, I think it is a must have for Mike Portnoy fans, but there was not that much advanced instruction, just some double-bass exercises, and he covered odd time signature a little. Don't buy this video, if you are just interested in learning. He talks about details of DT and LTE and counts some songs, and play a bunch of them. I really liked it because I just wanted to see him play, but I realized that to me it's not a instructional video."
5,A Phenomenon!!!!!!!,"This is by far the best DVD I have ever bought. Being one of many that look up to Portnoy on drums, I saw this and read all the reviews. When I finally watched it, I couldn't beileve everything on here:Extra concerts, tons of drum solos, many songs from both LTE and Dream theater, and not to mention he teaches you to play some of it. I really love how you can change the camera views on it also. If I recommend and DVD, it is this one FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,a great sequel,"Our 28month old son loves this book and it became the first book he asked to keep in his crib at night while he slept. The original (""Caps for Sale"") was also a favorite but our little music lover likes this one better because of the band and instruments. Great book to read soon after a child experiences a fair, carnival or circus because they can relate their experience to the book's pictures and story. The text is very good (but not as good as the first book, simply because I think the first book has truly outstanding text.) The book is very slightly, but not objectionably dated, with regard to race and gender depictions but the values depicted in the story are good and developmentally appropriate for toddlers on up. Definitely worth reading."
3,not as good as the original,"""Circus Caps for Sale"" is okay, but it is not as delightful as the original ""Caps For Sale"". It was a little disappointing."
3,"Great story, print quality only so-so","My kids love the story of this book. But the print quality is just ok. On several pages, the ink is very light."
4,Good for Indian Chai,I bought this pot to make Indian chai and it does its job very well. And its easy to clean.
5,Love it!,"Very solid and quite well made. It's very handy and doesn't take up much room. I've used it as a mixing bowl, to boil water and to fill my water filter pitcher/dispenser. Didn't need a pot holder (but I won't guarantee it as I made sure the handle wasn't near the heat and stopped it as soon as it boiled, so be SURE to test it yourself!)"
5,The perfect pot!,This has become my favourite pot for brewing up a batch of Masala Chai (Spiced Tea). I cannot recommend this pan enough.
4,Excellent Overview of Shintoism,"This book is perfect for those who wish to learn more about the Shinto religion -- or who want to learn about it, period. While it doesn't go into esoterics or much depth, this book is an excellent introduction into the festivals and practices and wards and charms and beliefs behind Shintoism. You'll finish with an understanding of a fascinating world religion, and many may find their intellect whetted for more... which this book unfortunately doesn't offer. However, for businessfolk who head to Japan often, for students going abroad to Japan, and for anime and manga fans looking for background info, this is a great source."
1,She has written better,I surely hope that Ms. Morsi goes back to what she does best and that is writing Americana stories.Her contemporary novels are sad and dull to say the least.The only reason I've kept reading is because I spent top dollar for it.
5,A Very Good Read!,I really enjoyed this book. One of the best contemporary women's books I have read in a long time. Couldn't put it down. Interesting to see 4 generations of women trying to get along in life in some troubled times. Complex and delightful charachters. It made me laugh and it made me cry. I could relate to each charachter in a different way. Made me see the importance of family and family love. Highly Recomended!!! Can't wait to read more of Pamela Morsi's books. This was my first one.
5,This is a great movie!!!,"I should know because I made it.Here's a little story: there's this one sequence where a couple of the cheerleaders are getting it on in a shower. My first cut was the most erotic scene the folks at Playboy Enterprises had ever seen. Everyone told me how sexy it was. When Hef saw it he had a cow. I got this memo from him telling me to tone it down. ""I'm not Larry Flynt!"", he exclaimed in the note to me. Naturally, I kept an uncut copy on my Avid for my personal archives. Needless to say, that when anyone wants to know what this movie really looked like, I show them my earlier unsanitized version.Nevertheless, the film is really good, despite the pathetic protestations from Carmen Electra that she wouldn't take off her clothes and the goofy music video, which I was forced to include."
5,DE LI CIOUS!!!,"MMMMM, MMMMM, GOOD! These have been an old favorite of mine for years. You'll love them too. Face it, they're better than candy. Next best thing to chocolate."
1,Mediocre performance - ugly smudges,"A cheap pen outperforms this ball point pen refill. I've been a happy Cross pen user for 25 years. However, the quality of the refills have dropped significantly (the recent one I purchased was made in China). This refill, which I am using in my Cross pen, right out the package, leads to ugly smudges when the pen first hits the paper. A small amount of ink leaks out over time, and settles on the tip, causing the smudge.The older refills I have for this pen work fine. The ones from China (this one) are absolute trash. I get better writing performance from a cheap free pen such as you might get in a hotel room. I will say that the feel of the Cross pen in my hand is of course far better than a cheap disposable pen, but the primary purpose of a pen is to write.Find a better quality refill. Don't buy this one."
1,Disappointed,"I used my Cross pen for almost a year using the same refill - it finally ran out, so I ordered this refill expecting the same great quality. The first refill lasted about 4 days (and it's not like I write essays - it's mostly just notes and grocery lists). I'm hoping the 2nd from this pack is better."
5,Pen Refill,"Cross makes fine pen refills, and, luckily, they fit Cross pens! The vendor was quick to send the order. Their shipping costs seem a bit pricey for an item that falls into the category of the weight of three sheets of paper that would fit into a plain envelope and boogie across the continent for the price of a single stamp, but since I was sick and tired of not being able to use my favourite pen, I quit caring about the money and got that which I wanted."
5,Great,I use cross pens exclusively. I write all day long . Genuine croos refills are the best and come in different widths and colors. Easy to get from Amazon.
5,A deep and lasting joy,"This book is a beautiful journey into the life of author Brenda Peterson, and her clear and intimate portraits of many wild creatures she encounters in her early years. She has an endearing compassion for the world of flora and fauna. Her activism is pure poetry. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in connecting with the power of words, wilderness, and the witnessing of our domestic and wild animal companions."
4,Enervating,Lorie Lines flawless piano playing with assistance from her ensemble makes Christmas a very special time.
4,JA Henckels 2 piece Mezzaluna Set,This item is intended for chopping fresh herbs but I use this item for chopping tossed salad ingredients. Only complaint is items being chopped get caught between the 2 blades. You need to be very careful when clearing out between the blades. Blades are very sharp. I probably should have purchased a single blade chopper.
3,Frequently bought together?,"Purchased the Herb cutter and the suggested sharpener only to find that the sharpener does not work for the double blades. What a waste, thanks for a useless suggestion Amazon, please review what you suggest to buy as a set."
3,Double blade a disappointment,"Have used the mincing set several times now and for the most part enjoy it. The draw back is the cutter (it is quite sharp, by the way - so be careful). Looking at it the cutter looks double efficient however, I've been using it with cilantro, which is clingy anyway and it really gets into the space between the blades. Difficult clearing it out and drying it without getting cut. Hoping for better results with parsely and other herbs. The board/bowl is great. Cleans up nicely."
3,Small design flaw,"Product works great, but as other reviewers have stated, the all-silver design poses a risk of grabbing the wrong curve. We put a rubber band around the handle to help avoid being cut."
4,Beautiful bamboo; mezzaluna is tricky to use.,"I thought I would really like the double-bladed mezzaluna, but I find I don't so much. As another reviewer said, things you are chopping get stuck between the blades. That said, it makes quick work of chopping and is very, very sharp. I haven't needed to sharpen the blades yet, but I think if I needed to I could unscrew one of the blades and sharpen it with my Presto electric knife sharpener.The cutting board is beautiful, very dense wood, and a pleasure to use. I give it a bit of food-grade mineral oil periodically to keep the wood healthy. Normally, unless I am chopping something that needs soap to wash, I just rinse it after I'm finished chopping something vegetable in nature and stand it on its side to drip dry. This works well."
1,Skips/stops working without warning!,"I have used the Cross black gel refills for awhile and have been very happy with them. I usually prefer blue ink, so I decided to give the blue gel a try. Well, needless to say, I have been VERY disappointed! I've tried two different refills from two different stores, and both have skipped badly and/or stopped writing completely after only a few days. You can read other reviews for this refill online and see that everyone else is having the same issues. I expect better from Cross and can't believe that they have so many problems with the blue gel refills. The company definitely needs to fix the quality issues they are having with the blue gel and bring it to the point where it's on par with the black gel refill (which, again, is one of the best I have ever written with)."
3,Does not fit Ballpoint Cross Pens,"This review is purely to comment on the NON-UNIFORMITY of refills.Fortunately, I did my research before purchasing a refill, but it took FOREVER to find the right information. In fact, I had to eventually call Cross Customer Service to find out wether all Cross ReFills were interchangeable and would fit all Cross pens - THEY DO NOT! If your Cross pen is a ballpoint it will always be a ballpoint and visca versa.Maybe that is just common sense and I am the stupid one here, but hopefully somebody will benefit from this review."
4,Bye Bye Hot Flashes!,"When I remember to take one capsule each morning and evening, I have been having very little problem with hot flashes."
1,Black Cohosh,"Although this product is favored highly for hot flashes, it did nothing for me.I could not recommend it to others."
4,A terrific idea but,"I agree with an earlier reviewer that this was an excellent idea for a DVD package of ST:TNG episodes. An avid fan, I nevertheless cannot justify (or even handle) the expense of purchasing the complete seasons on DVD. Special collections would answer the needs of fans such as myself -- which is why I would have liked to see others presented as well, perhaps focusing on Data, Worf, Riker & Troi, and so forth.I purchased this, frankly, solely for the inclusion of ""The Inner Light"", in my mind one of the finest hours of science fiction television ever produced. It alone was well worth the price of the DVD.However, I must also agree that the absence of ""The Best of Both Worlds"", ""Chain of Command"" and even ""All Good Things..."" is puzzling. This first two, in particular, are the definitive Picard episodes, and the collection seems odd without them."
5,The Drumhead is the best Star Trek Episode in this set,Don't let the others fool you. I think the Drumhead is the best episode in this set and one of the top 5 best TNG episodes of all time. I rate it better than even 'The Measure of a Man' and Darmok etc. The final scene where Picard talks with Worf is perhaps the best TNG dramatic scene of all time. Personally I think this is better than even the over sentimental 'The Inner Light'.
4,Jean Luc Picard Collection,"Its really great, but I would have chosen Attached over Drumhead as one of the episodes along with Darmok and Inner Lightwhich are fantastic. I think it would have assured a 5 star rating to the collection. Nevertheless, it's well worth the buy."
4,But I'd Rather See A Borg Collection,"As an avid fan I already own the entire NG series on DVD and this seems to be just a ploy to draw more money from Trek fans. However, since Paramount is doing this, and no doubt it will sell, why not also make a collection of the Borg episodes and include or offer alongside, the First Contact Movie. So when the Voyager series is completed we can expect the Voyager-Borg collection as well. The Borg, the aliens you love to hate!If your don't own the series this is a good way to get a 'piece of the action' cheap. The Inner Light is by far the best episode in this collection."
5,Best book on St.Andre' Bessette,I have read three books by different authors of the life of St.Andre' Bessette of Montreal. This one by Hatch is by far the best. More detail of the life of this wonder Saint and more photos.
3,Sister Mary joins Vixen?,"Radar is a melodic rock band that features Pamela Moore (Sister Mary from Queensryche'sOperation: Mindcrime) on vocals. RPM is a throwback album in every respect. Each track on RPM could have come from Vixen's debut album, and while that may not be a bad thing (particularly if you're a Vixen fan), it's still a bit odd to see a band in 2000 release such an unabashed tribute to the hair metal glory days.RPM features 10 tracks full of big hooks, catchy choruses, and plenty of keyboards, all led by Pamela Moore's dynamic voice. A ""by the numbers"" melodic rock album may not be what you'd expect from ""Sister Mary"", but it's hard to argue with the results.The track listing is as follows:1. Power of Money2. Yours Tonight3. Mirror Mirror4. Lookin' for Love5. Shot Down6. Celebration7. In Your Eyes8. Rockin'9. Something's Goin' On10. Win Your Heart"
4,Clueless no longer!!!,"Don't confuse this book with the multiplying ""Complete Idiots"" and ""Dummies"" guides currently flooding the market. Darwin Ortiz's take on the ins and outs of popular casio games is highly readable in the best ""you are there"" style. He completely demystifies table games for people like myself who may have seen scared away from plucking down our chips due to the mistaken belief that you have to be a math whiz to figure out Craps. With the skill of travel writer who daps about plenty of color, Ortiz repeatedly hammers home that most casinos offer exotic bets that are a complete waste of your wallet. Just skip the bells and whistles and play to form. While the book is lacking in illustrations, each chapter consistantly does the job of taking you from Vegas chump to wordly shark (or the belief thereof)."
1,Don't Bother,Learning how to actually play the games is all you need to know. Why waste money on this book when you can waste it in Vegas? There is no magick you will be given by this book to make you win every game you play. Don't waste you stupid time!
4,Compact and Succinct,"This book provides a compact yet thorough glossary of Forensic Science terms. The definitions are clear, concise and are worded in layman's terms. The glossary covers a wide range of topics within the Forensic Science field. I recommend this book to anyone associated with the field looking for an easy reference source of simple definitions."
1,They're going back.,"Missing a rubber grip on one of the cups. Amazon's order information tells me the name of the seller, but the seller says they were bought through amazon direct. Not sure about this so I have to send them back. Besides, if the rubber grip comes off one cup when the set is brand new I think that means trouble as time goes on. I won't order a replacement set from the same manufacturer - probably will go with a solid stainless steel set. The weight on this set is just ok."
3,Great pot but the handle is way too short,"The short handle and lack of an additional handle on the other side of the pot makes pouring the contents of the pot very difficult. I also find that the lid is not as ""tight fitting"" as Le Creuset would like you to think. Whenever I boil water, some of it will spit out over the side of the pot. It may just be my pot. Overall, I love the Le Creuset line b/c they are great to cook with and super easy to clean. I would pass on this pot and buy a Le Creuset french oven of a similar size, it'll do the job just as well."
1,"a badley written begginners book, not for some one who is familiar with crowley isms.",try me on ' Gems from the Equinox.' that arrived to day. Great ! I am really into it already.
5,Straightforward book on Thelema,Rodney Orpheus is the singer from The Cassandra Complex and it turns out that he's good at explaining Crowley's magickal system to modern readers. Hard to think of any other recent books which successfully tackle this material. I understand that the O.T.O. (or one them anyway) recommends the book.
5,Spirited,"This CD was recommended by one of my Native brothers, and to this day,I can't thank him enough for it."
5,"Wonderful, brilliant, soulful",This album gives you a feel that every song gets better than the previous one even when you skip back to the previous. A true masterpiece no matter what many negative reviews say. Just let go of all theories and enjoy this one.
4,Sacred Spirit 2,"This is a excellent arrangement of native american music. thrilling and brings you closer to native peoples culture can be played and enjoyed for all occasions ,"
5,Great,"love the muisc, would order form this person again, will wrok great for my bussiness, happy to add to my collection"
4,A nice piece of new age music. The string section is my favorite.,I enjoy the men and women in this CD. I would like to hear it longer. If only it was 30 minutes longer!
3,Good but uneven,"Really like some of the works on this Cd, but some just don't measure up to the others. Just okay."
5,This isn't actually Native American music...,"which some loytalist or self proclaimed loyalist will reap. The chants and the female vocals used are native american and the production has a feel to it, an alien but familiar feel to the first album. The female singer on Dela Dela and May you walk in Sunshine is not to be missed. I think her name is Cherokee Rose, I am not certain. Anyway, this is a great album that should be checked out with an open mind. No one can label or classify Native American music because... gasp! There aren't many of us in the scene. Maybe if you look behind the glossy covers of more mainstream types, you may find something. Good luck!"
4,pleasant but too much electronic effects,"I heard this CD while I was in a crystal store and really liked and so I ended up buying it from Amazon. It is a relaxing CD but I found that the Native American Chants were pretty much overpowered by the electronic music effects. Initially, I bought this CD to mainly experience the Native American Chants but I was somewhat disappointed. If the special electronic music complements the chants, I think it would be a much better CD."
5,The Spirits are in Spirits II,"I purchased Spirits I several years ago. This past summer I heard Spirits II while I was visiting ""The Great Land,"" Alaska. Spirits II is a very nice compliment to Spirits I. It is a beautiful piece of work and I only hope the producers will continue their work and make this an on-going series. The only downside to Spirits II compared to Spirits I is the producers chose not to provide a synopsis of each song as this did with Spirits I. If you are interested in this type of music, you will not be disappointed with this fine work."
3,Sacred Spirit 2,"Most of the songs were great, I would give 5 stars if I liked every song, but there were several I didn't care for."
5,What It Is,"sacred spirits traverses america in both location and time. while other native american music is more ancient, this is about connecting to the land today as a native american in your car and thinking about the combining of cultures that brought us from the cherokee's trail of tears to the tears and trails in a jeep grand cherokee. it is about casinos, the freedom of the road, and cornbread (especially the unsweetened kind in an iron skillet served with pintos). it is also about the many cultures today that have blended to defend this land and freedom. this cd has the bells that i connect to happy thoughts as a child visiting cherokee, north carolina, before the casino. native america is not an ancient culture of the past. it IS our culture."
2,Coming from a cartographer...,"The previous edition of this atlas was excellent, but this one looks like the graphic design department got a hold of it and the actual cartography took a back seat. For example, there are whole sections of countries hidden in the spine of the book. And the borders are two inches thick which takes up space that could have been used to expand the map. I feel those are two of the most important things when looking at an atlas, being able to see the country and not have an inch cut out the middle, and have the map be as big as the page allows without distorting it. If you are going to buy this atlas, buy the previous paperback edition, which is an excellent atlas for its size and price!"
4,Hammond Middle East Atlas,"This is an adequate reference, but it is difficult to distinguish between the markings for international and internal boundaries."
5,Does it's job very well and stylishly....,"This colander is both beautiful and very effective. Water drains out very quickly from the quite large bowl. I did a lot of research to find a ""best buy"" colander and this is the winner!"
4,Great stainless colander,I love this colander. I have been looking for a strong stainless colander and finally found one. It is durable and a great quality of stainless. I love it and highly recommend it.
4,Came back to buy a second one,"Bought one in 2005 for twenty five dollars.Came back in 2011 to get another, price seems to have risen.As others have said, it is well made, solid, truly stainless."
5,Great product,"Great product. Works very well, and easier to clean than those ones that look like wire mesh. Works perfectly for pasta, if a little large. Very durable, should last for quite some time."
3,the protruding feets make it annoying to clean.,The protruding tripod feets make it annoying to clean - especially the starch residue of pasta. I would recommend the Tovolo with the continuous round base for this reason - much easier to clean.
3,Nice,"Nice and sturdy. I wish it was dishwasher approved but hand washing is alright too. Its a keeper, and no plastic!"
5,Love this,"This colander is beautiful, sturdy and entirely functional. I love that it has feet instead of a ring so that water drains quickly rather than pooling around a ring (which can happen when I dump a pot of pasta into a colander)."
5,Beautiful!,"A great kitchen product. Couldn't love it more. Great quality, and perfect for all straining, washing vegetables or fruit. Couldn't be happier!"
2,Not the quality I expected.,"I have the same pouch that I purchased directly from Motorola and the quality is a heck of a lot better. I believe this is a knock-off product even thought they use the Motorola model number and logo on the pouch. If not, Motorola has really lowered their quality standards with this product. The locking swivel bracket does not lock in place like my original one does either, so the phone and pouch swivels around while wearing it."
1,Don't buy this if you plan on loading it into a PC,I doubted the review below that mentioned how bad the dual-disc is. Shouldn't have. I wasn't able to load the CD tracks onto either my home or work PCs. And couldn't even play it on my CD player at home. It took a Mac to actually read the files. Bad news. Should be recalled.
1,Case of Twelve?,"Be careful ordering things like this. What came was a single refill. The title is deceptive. If the price seems too good, it probably is."
4,A Great Beginner Primer,"This book is a must have for those that are new to the game of chess or that want to start delving into the theory that will be mandatory if one wants to go from losing every game to winning some. The first third of the book was useless for me, because it focused on how the pieces move about the board and chess history. Nothing which i didnt already know or need to know. The book then continues with tactical basics like pins/forks and Seirawan gives sample games where one can see these tactics in action. So, yes I think it is a great book for beginners or newbies, but not for someone who is looking to progress into the intermediate phase of their chess training. His other books provide much more theory and topic specific info than this one."
4,Fundamentals,"To me, 4 stars means ""good"" - ""better than average"" but not ""excellent."" Although I'm a little tired of books which review the ""this is how this piece moves,"" this book only give a token nod to piece movement. It focuses mainly on four basic concepts: force, time, space and pawn structure. If you don't understand why these four topics are critical to your basic play, this book is for you. This book, as does the entire series, has quizzes throughout the chapters and tests at the end of each chapter. These help make sure you understood what the chapters were about. The last real chapter covers annotated games that nicely demonstrate the principles. Personally, I enjoyed the history section in the beginning. I had grown a little tired of ""the queen wasn't always this powerful"" descriptions in most books and I finally know when the pieces' powers changed and what they changed from... nice perk."
4,Fundamentals,"This book helped me greatly with refreshing the fundamentals of the game. In everything I do, I always review the fundaments periodically, and this is the book I will use for chess basics. It is very basic, but it is a good start."
3,More of an approach book and not methodological,Well written and partitioned by stages in a chess game. Good for someone who has either been playing for some time or is teaching beginners
4,Great for absolute beginner,"If you've always wanted to learn how to play chess, but just never got around to it, then this is a great book for you. If you already know the rules, how the pieces move, and maybe even some very basic strategy, then you're well beyond the scope of this book already.Of the many books available that teach the absolute beginner how to play, this is one of the better ones."
2,No Subtitle Menu on Blu-Ray,"""Orlando"" is one of my favorite Handel operas and this production looks good and has an excellent cast and performance. However, there is no subtitle menu on the Blu-Ray edition and my Blu-Ray remote does not have a subtitle menu, so I could not use the subtitles.I have a rather large collection of opera DVD's and all the ones with subtitles have a subtitle menu, so I am assuming this Blu-Ray does not have subtitles.If this disc had subtitles, I would have given it 5 stars. However, without the subtitles, I cannot recommend it."
5,For the techno buffs...,"For those who know this guy you know you're in for a treat. Crazy bleeps, mad drums, sleazy breaks, trippy interludes. This is a masterpiece. Can listen to this over and over again without getting bored."
4,a good reference book.,A good reference book for Java Web Services. It had most of what I was looking for. Lacked depth and samples but the nutshell series was always meant to be more a reference than a tutorial.
2,Cheesy,"This is the first fireplace DVD I have purchased and I would not recommend it to others. Most of the scenes were filmed a little too close and the music is heinous. The candle scene it nice for the holidays, but overall I think it could use some work."
2,Misleading cover and DVD,"This DVD was OK, the pictures were fine, and I would have loved it except to two reasons.1. Each fire lasts about 10min. I thought that I could just use my DVD's looping feature to make it last forever, but they locked that feature out. You see the fire fade to black every 10 min. it's kinda distracting.2. The makers of the DVD have two DVD's with the same cover. I thought that I was ordering the one with more features, but it turns out that the you can only tell which version of the DVD you have by reading the small print (Extended title) under Ambient Fire.I would look for more before I bought this one."
2,Simply Blue?,"What Happend with Mick's Simply Red,. cause this sounds more like Simply Blue. It has pretty much nothing to do with the rest of the other music, the song ""Blue"" is what made me buy the cd, Im sorry but I just couldn't relate with the rest of the Album."
2,The beginning of the end?,"Even the wondrous vocals of Mick Hucknall can't save this CD from the pits. The music is buried in schmalztzy, EZ-listening arrangements, and the material leaves much to be desired. What happened to the energy of ""The Right Thing"" and ""Fairground,"" or the complex balladry of ""Holding Back the Years?"" Instead, the listener is treated to a half-baked remake of the already overrated tune ""The Air that I Breathe"" (in TWO different versions, even!) and other bland, uninspired, middle of the road pop. A MAJOR disappointment, especially for a follow-up to an album as fine as ""Life."""
2,Could have been so much more!,"I'm a major Simply Red fan so I bought this CD with only the best thoughts. After a listen I was deeply sad. After a second listen I just could not play it again. This CD lacks the power, passion and feelings of the past releases. It seemed to me like the group was trying to make a good ""90s"" record:( Some people should stick to what works for them and not try and be something they are not. Sorry guys, this hurts me more than you."
2,Simply Red's new CD lacks the creativity of previous works,"The new CD sound as if it sprang from a previous trip to the studio. Perhaps the leftovers that were not quite good enough for the ""LIFE"" CD. This group has grown with each new CD giving us a fresh sound and exploring new territory. ""The Air That I Breathe"" is a decent cover but the rest just sounds like churning out a new record. Too bad from one of my favorites."
4,Clearly not his best...,"This one contains some very tast nuggests but there's also a considerable amount of filler here. The cover of ""The Air That I Breathe"" containing snippets from ""Jack and Diane"" brings something exciting into a tune that's been covered too often. ""Say You Love Me"" wouls sound great on the radio, though it probably won't find favor here. This album's Aretha Franklin cover is a disaster. Overall, this disc isn't up to the quality of ""Stars"" but will provide enjoyment to those who've liked Mick's previous work."
3,Terrible album cover- Their worst effort,"I think the album cover did it. Yep. it's responsible!Actually 2.5 stars but I'll be nice because he's a superb singer!Not the best for me, but does contain some rare gems such as "" Mellow my mind "" and "" Love has said Goodbye""but the rest leaves a lot to be desired and are average to poor.Nobody's perfect though!Mick deserved a bad one, after all the other brilliance.He truly has a voice like an angel.Try "" Love and the Russian Winter"", "" Picture Book"" or "" A New Flame"" instead.For hard core fans only!"
1,Ugh!,"Mick, Baby,--yeah, you with the beautiful tenor, brilliant lyrics, and incredible tunes--What were you thinking? I couldn't even listen to this one all the way through. Please don't do this again."
3,On the strength of two songs only...,"Say You Love Me and Love Has Said Goodbye Again are worth the price of the CD. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD leaves me cold.Mick has a great voice, and these two songs are just wonderful. I can listen to them over and over again. Can't say the same about the rest of the CD though. Very forgetable!"
5,Every track is a picture of emotions from beginning to end,"This new cd is very moving, ever song brings out a certain emotion within yourself. Soulfull is what this cd is. From the drum beats to the strumming of the guitar. Then you top it off with Mr. Hucknall's soulfull vocal, you get a fantastic cd which journeys to your soul."
2,Not up to their standards,"This was another disappointing effort from Playboy Videos. They spend too much time with their trite premises, rather than focusing on the nudity that the viewers want. The models are OK, for the most part, but there could have been a lot more going on. Pretty lame stuff. Sorry"
2,No longer a quality pen,"Cross quality has decreased since the last generation. This pen scratches and dents easily, collects fingerprints, and has a thin metal exteroir.I compared this pen to a similar model from 20 years ago, and the older pen is far superior.Similar is true for the more expensive fountain pens, which feel, like cheap plastic."
2,Not as good as the older ones,"I have 3 cross pens from long ago that still write better than the new one I received as a gift. The new one has a lot more plastic in it also. Considering the price, I dont recommend this pen."
4,Classic style in an affordable form,"I loved this pen. You notice past tense. I have had a plethora of fine pens. Each one of them was discovered later, missing. No matter what I did, short of clipping them to my pocket like your old mittens, the pens disappear. However nice this pen is, I take my leave of fine pens. I should have done what smart Wall Street types do. They have gold Cross pens adorning their pockets and they never ever remove them.THis pen is beautiful and affordable; buy it...don't lose it."
3,"Same Cross style, not the same quality as old ones","Cross pens have an awesome style, feel nice in your hand, good weight, write well, and come in a giftable box. All great. The price is fair - but unlike the old Cross pens made in USA - with very tight fit and finish, this one is made in China, and the pieces don't fit together quite so tightly. It's not what I'd call sloppy, but it's also not the watch-like construction like what you're used to in a premium pen."
1,I read everyone's complaints about it being from China,"and I didn't think it was going to be THIS bad. I'm positive that you can get a better quality pen at the dollar store. This thing feels like cheapo plastic painted chrome, it hardly has any weight to it and it's not smooth when you twist it either. This is worst than junk."
2,"Cross Classic Century, Lustrous Chrome",It came a day earlier than the expected day. I was very happy and when i cut open the box the pen is in looked fabulous. I was very excited. I opened the box took out the pen thats when my rating went down. The pen was not what I was expecting. The top is very shaky and it feels like it is just going to break apart soon. I would say if you are going to buy a cross pen you should just save your money and buy a better one.
1,Cheaply Made,"I used to have a made-in-the-USA version of this pen. It was great. This one is terrible. It is lighter, the parts are loose, and the materials are noticeably cheaper. I read the other reviews before purchasing, but I thought, it is just a pen, how bad could it be? Well, the answer is, really bad. Don't buy."
3,"Not perfect, but works","I actually have the exact pen made several years ago and labeled USA. In my comparison, the older one does feels more solid. The tops are interchangeable BUT the new top doesn't always fit perfectly with either new/old base. Takes a little tweaking to get it to fit just right. Newer requires 1/4 extra twist to use, not as smooth, and just seems cheaper. Still, it is a slim pen that does what it promises."
3,Not what they used to be.,"My wifey to be got me one last year for my birthday...it was one of the new ones manufactured in China. The build quality was notably lower than the older American pens. The gap in the middle of the pen was a bit wider, and the 2 sections of barrel did not meet up as cleanly. The pen also didn't feel quite as dense in the hand. The pen did come in an attractive box with securing bands however which was rather nice.It is not a bad pen, and it wrote with smooth precision, but the luxurious feel is all gone. That feel is half of what I pay for with these things, and as a result, I will be switching to Parker pen products from here on out."
5,Great Ball Point Pen,I am 62years.I have always been using Cross Pens both for my professional work as well as for my personal use. I would not even think of changing my brand.The present ball point pen I purchased is one more to my collection of Cross Pens. I would always recommend this pen for day to day use.
2,Not nearly as nice as it used to be...,"I bought this pen to replace a similar one I'd had for years and recently lost...and boy I'm even more sorry about losing my old one than before. The new isn't bad, but it's definitely not on the same quality level as they used to be as several others review note. I wish they'd spent less money on the overdone packaging and invested that in maintaining the high quality Cross for which Cross used to be known. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice been, it's just not nearly as nice and impressive as it used to be."
1,Anodized pen,"Do not buy a cross pen with colors. The color will come off and they do not warranty it. My pen is 6 months old and the color has come off really bad. Charlie Ramsey Waco ,Tx"
2,Great pen - mine just isn't right,"Pen is great, I've used them before. The one I received didn't line up properly so the ink tip bent and never worked right. Ended up throwing out within a week...."
4,Fine Cross Ballpoint Pen,"My daughter requested a good-quality ballpoint pen as a Christmas gift. The Cross ballpoint pen fit the bill and arrived promptly. I had hoped it might be accompanied by a pouch for storage, but it is more than acceptable as is."
5,eddie macon's run,i love the movie and i will continue to buy movies from you and when i fine one i like.
1,never received it,"I ORDERED THIS MOVIES ALONG WITH OTHER ITEMS, SADLY I NEVER RECEIVED THIS, . I EMAILED THE SELLER, BUT NEVER EVER EVER HEARD BACK, ,, I AM HAPPY WITH EVERYTHING ELSE I ORDER,"
2,Hollywood Gothic is tiresome to read,"The main character is a selfish, self-centered egotist with no redeeming qualities. I stopped reading when he encounters some mentally challenged children as the story seem trite."
5,I love this stuff,It's really good. my face is so clear and smooth. after some research on silk amino acids i bought this mask and thus far i cant say im disappointed.
3,Not exactly a page turner...,"Called an ""urban mystery"" and ""daring occult novel"", I was disappointed to find way too little of either of these things. I think the occult part is supposed to involve a character named Hiram; tho he appears in very little of the story. He is supposed to be over 200 years old, and seems to come and go somewhat mysteriously. Anything else occult that he does appears in only a handful of pages very late in the book. Even then, it doesn't seem to really be occult as much as a slide show (were there slides back then?) of pictures that bother the other characters. It is not clear why. I found it very hard to keep going; tho I did finally finish. Even tho it's fiction, I think it is probably a good account of life at that time. If that's what you want, you'll enjoy it. Just don't go into this looking for an occult mystery."
4,"it's a plastic card case, guys","These are plastic card cases. Do not let your expectations run wild. They are not filled with magic, or the secrets of the universe. They do not even contain memory cards. These are just the cases.Are they waterproof? Probably not. Are they sand-storm-proof? Probably not. Are they crush-proof? Probably not. Are they proof against extremes of heat and cold? Probably not. Will they hold a standard CF card and give it a minimal, basic level of protection from the other stuff in your bag? Yes. They do that very thing.They arrived on time, in good shape, and none have broken yet. I am content.NOTE: I am using these for CF cards, not SD cards. You could put an SD card in them, but I don't think they were especially designed for such use."
2,Item pictured is not the item received.,Item pictured is not the item received. It is a huge plastic box (cf card size) but no tabs to secure smaller cards...as shown in the picture. Any card smaller than compact flash card will slide around. Completely useless. Save your money and look elsewhere.
2,does not have interior holders to secure card.,The description states that these hold all types of memory cards but the reason is that it has no holder clips inside. The card slides around freely. I do not recommend this but it was cheap so I kept them anyway
4,hard to open,"I received these cases with no problem but once I opened the package, opening the cases is very difficult. Still have not quite figuered out how they work. They hold several different kinds of cards, I only needed a case for SD cards so the cases are quite a bit bigger than what I need but they serve the purpose...."
1,Cases don't fit SD or SD/HD cards,"This case is pretty useless - has no internal lugs to hold cards in place, so they just float around loose - not a meaningfull protection for the cards."
1,Disappointing,"The Pedrini Ergo can opener is pretty to look at, and it worked smoothly - more or less - the first few times I used it. But then it stiffened up on me, and even if I lubricate it, the handle doesn't turn easily, nor do the cutting blades cut reliably all the way around the can. I bought an ice cream scoop made by the same company, and I'm disappointed with it, too. It's heavy, and the squeeze lever is extremely stiff and difficult to use - and I have good-sized hands, and am quite strong! (Heaven forbid that anyone with arthritis should try to use either of these tools.)"
2,Pedrini Ergo Can Opener,"Our canopener worked great at first, but in less than 1 year the bearings wore out and the opener was difficult to use. The opener then broke in half at the handle hinge. I assume that this was because the opener did not cut the can very well in turn placing too much pressure on the handle. The most upsetting thing of all is how Target the store I purchased the opener from handled the attempt to return. They acted as though they knew nothing about the product and said I would have to settle with the manufacturer. What happened to customer service."
4,LOVE THIS THING!,"i give it a 4.5 stars.i had been looking for a can opener for a while before i came across this pedrini opener. at first glance i liked the look of this gadget and the price was reasonable. i use it regularly and never had any problems with it, its grips are comfortable and it opens cans with little effort.can openers are low committment products so why not give this one a try?"
1,Condescending Trash,"I have lived in Japan for years, and also had the experience of biking around the country- a most interesting way to see the country, to be sure. Reading Don's book, I wonder if he was in the same Japan at all. He reveals little of the Japanese soul- just that he experienced friendly smiles from the locals. He caught a few colorful festivals. He ate local foods.I think the problem is, not really understanding Japanese, it is hard to really get deep into the culture. To learn what lies beneath the polite smiles- that is the essence of travel writing!Being a Gaijin (and in my case, an African Gaijin) will always draw attention from the locals, especially in the less touristed spots. It is easy to feel like a ""movie star"". But when you get home, you have to wonder if the experience is really a book-worthy one. I'd have to say in this case, it wasn't."
1,A Biased View of Japan,"I was saddened to see the author miss several opportunities to correct historical fallacies often perpetuated by the Japanese. Referring to the East Sea as the ""Sea of Japan"" is one such example. This name is the result of Japanese imperial aggression and should be dropped in favor of more neutral language. Throughout the book, one only reads of the politeness of the Japanese. I doubt the countless women of Korea, China and the Philippines raped and kept as ""comfort women"" during Japanese occupation would agree with that assessment. No mention is given to the various cultural treasures Japan looted from her Asian neighbors.In Chapter 3, the author uses the word ""cripple"". As a differently-abled senior, still bearing wounds from the Japanese aggression, I find the term a little more than offensive.Thankfully, Japan is moving towards rapproachment with her neighbors. I hope that books like this one will not reverse the positive steps already taken in that direction."
4,"Solid, but something is missing...","My long time favourite is Bon Voyage, but when I saw this one on the shelf I bought immidietely. While listening, I had a feeling that all that groove and energy that I'm used to while listening to U.F.O. is gone in this album. (Or maybe not yet there, because CD is released 1995). However, it is still a solid piece of music and I would recommend it to a true fan of U.F.O.Keep Jazzin'!"
5,Guidebook,"This book looks excelent.It can show me lots of beanies , there price , date of birth and everything i need to know about beanies which will help me collect them . I have some beanies which are worth alot of money for example ""Patti The Fuchsia platypus born on 6/1/93. Yours faithfully Megan"
4,The beanie mania handbook,"As i am a huge fan of ty beanie babies i would like to write a review on the Beanie Mania Handbook.This handbook is extremely usefull.It shows a list of beanies available from a-z , thier birthdays and other information about them and it is for sale at an excellent priceMegan.."
4,"Good energy, excellent supporting cast","Not every track is a gem but there are several memorable, almost unforgettable tracks.13. There Goes the Neighborhood - the track Sean Penn used for the crawl in his film ""Hurlyburly"". With Keith Richards (the devil himself) playing guitar like it was twenty years ago and a background chorus of The Dixie Chicks, Sarah McLaughlan, and Chrissie Hynde.4. A Little Change - wonderful energy and again, the world's most telented backup singers in The Dixie Chicks and Sarah McLaughlan.These two tracks alone (and there are some other winners) make it worth the purchase."
1,Pass this one up,"Sheryl Crow is one of my favorite rock artists. That said, this is a poor album - poor sound quality with poor performances. I enjoyed watching the concert associated with this CD, but the CD doesn't have any spark - she is singing flat and the music is slow and plodding.If you want to hear Sheryl Crow live, go see her live."
1,Pass this one us,"Sheryl Crow is one of my favorite rock artists. That said, this is a poor album - poor sound quality with poor performances. I enjoyed watching the concert associated with this CD, but the CD doesn't have any spark - she is singing flat and the music is slow and plodding.If you want to hear Sheryl Crow live, go see her live."
4,Sheryl Crow Live In Central Park,"I went to this show, and it was great. The best parts are when Sheryl partners up with her guests. Great versions of songs come out of that. Some of my friends said that on TV it wasn't that great, but in person, it was excellent. So if the CD, which I don't own yet, captures that sound right, it will be a great purchase."
4,She Rock,"Sheryl Crow just needs to ROCK. Although she can sing the sweet, wonderful ballads with the best of them...when she ROCKS, she gets DOWN! Sheryl in a concert setting is the way to go."
3,Older Stuff better...,"When listening to this much awaited album, i found myself asking myself where Sheryl's vocals have gone? ""Maybe she has been on too much coffee and nicotine?"". That was my only question. Older Sheryl stuff is better than this live compilation of songs, adding special guests to make her flat vocals seem irrelevant. Not so. I was mildly amused, but find myself listening to other earlier recordings of shows. While an ok buy, take the extra time and get a bootleg of her in 93 or 94."
5,LIVE IN CENTRAL PARK = GREAT ALBUM!,"Of Course, anything from Sheryl Crow would be great, but this is AWESOME! It's so much fun, and it really makse you get up and ROCK! YIPPE! Go out and be ""Strong Enough"" and buy this record. Or, ""If it Makes You Happy"", buy it right now from Amazon.com!"
2,SHERYL SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE STAGE!,"ON THE SECOND OR THIRD SONG IN SARA MCLAUGHLIN SINGS ON ""THE DIFFICULT KIND."" SHERYL CROW IS PRETTY GOOD ROCK STAR. DATED CLAPTON. CAN LOOK SWEET OR TOUGH. BUT LET'S FACE IT, SHE IS NO SARA MCLAUGHLIN. SM CAN COVER ANY STYLE AND SOUND GREAT. SC IS HARDLY WORTHY OF HER COMPANY. SM MAKES THAT ONE SONG GREAT, BUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM PALES IN COMPARISON.TO BRING OUT SOME OF ROCK'S GREATEST ACTS TO PLAY THIS MATERIAL IS REALLY SAD. SC HAS NO PLACE WITH ANY OF THESE STARS. OK, THE SHE COULD BE THE FOURTH DIXIE CHICK, BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.BELIEVE ME, I DON'T HATE CROW, I JUST THINK SHE DOESN'T BELONG IN THE COMPANY OF SOME OF ROCK AND ROLL'S GREATEST. THE ATTEMPT SOUND LIKE A MISFIT..."
1,This No-Talent Has Friends?,"With a snip here and a little leather there the once boring Sheryl Crow has transformed to an uglier boring Sheryl Crow. The nineties ushered in some bad artists but none which best exemplifies mediocrity to the extreme as Mr. Sheryl Crow. Early success and an average at best career does and should not result in a ""special concert/event"". Ms. Crow slurs and bores all in her ""Friends"" concert. This pathetic attempt to bring togehter music talent failed. Stuff like this can only be done by proven talent. Sheryl Crow has managed to somehow make it this far---It doesn't mean she should be headlining TV specials."
5,Wonderful Live CD,"This is a must have for any Sheryl Crow fan. From rocking tunes with Chrissy Hynde on ""If It Makes You Happy"" to slow ones with Dixie Chicks on ""Strong Enough"" you can tell why Sheryl is to be praised for her musical accomplishments. She also does ""Difficult Kind"" with Sarah Mclachlan which is a very beautiful song. My favorites are ""Gold Dust Woman"" with Stevie Nicks and ""There Goes The Neighborhood."" Neighborhood is one of those songs that you have to hear live. I would recommend this cd to everyone because Sheryl Crow is a very talented woman and you can tell this by the company that she keeps."
4,It's a commendable effort,"After planning to watch this live concert on TV, and then missing it, I was highly anticipating the release of the CD version. I was impressed by the high power of energy, but it did not surpass my expectations. Her guests are incredible, most notably Stevie Nicks on 'Gold Dust Woman', helping to make this CD what it is. It also includes older Crow tracks, all of which are done quite nicely with audience reactions. It is apparent that Sheryl had a great time doing this, and you will be able to hear that on this album; however, don't expect a phenomenal effort. All in all, this is an attempt to gather notority, which she succeeds in doing on this album."
2,Fails to come alive.,"As a long-time Sheryl Crow fan, I jumped on the chance to buy this live album. Although I really, really tried to like this CD, I couldn't stop being bored by it. ""The Difficult Kind"" is the only track that I fully enjoyed, with ""Tombstone Blues"" running a close second. The prospect of hearing Sheryl Crow sing with a handful of other awesome artists was intriguing, but their presence doesn't seem liven up this album enough. It fails to capture the energy of the original performance. While I am still a loyal fan, I regret purchasing ""Sheryl Crow and Friends."" I feel that her studio albums are far superior."
5,Durable and Great for Travel,"If you are planning a trip to Spain or Mexico, you will want to bring the SM-500 along. It is very durable, just toss in the suit case. The viewfinder makes it easy to show what you are trying to say in there language- if you speak Spanish or English you will live this great gadget."
2,Christopher R. Sabat is a FREAK!!,"well abt this dvd the story is perfect,but voice actors,specially Christopher R. Sabat sucks,yamcha sounds like a loser and vegeta sounds like a smoker,but the other one which was edited that was released a longtime ago, which was'nt uncut,in that all the voices are damn perfect,vegeta sounds like a royal prince in that.and yamcha sounds good.in this new uncut version goku's voice is cool,and gohan does'nt sound like a kid,rather like a 12 year old boy,and explosions are not hardcore(sound)even though its 5.1 surround the old edited version has more movie like explosive sounds,overall i do not recommend any of these uncut dbz dvd's,but from episode 054, though its uncut the voices are ok."
2,Book Club Reader,Someone else recommended this book to the club. I do not know why. Rarely do I abandon a book before I finish reading. I did this one.
2,not for me,"When I read the description on Amazon I thought the story sounded like the Red Violin and I love learning about history and time periods through character narratives. But this novel is a total snooze fest, I knew I didn't like it in the beginning before she fell in the shaft but I kept reading waiting for the other stories. We finally get to the ancient China part of the story and I'm still bored and end up flipping pages looking for something to happen, I was disappointed, I won't finish it. I give a two for effort.For the people who liked it more power to ya but if you want to read a couple good stories from another culture try Pearl s. Buck's books, or Three Cups of Tea, or the Kite Runner."
4,I enjoyed this book.,"I read a lot of historical fiction, and I also read to be entertained. This book ""fit the bill"". It also made me stop and think, now and then."
4,Ursula Under,"I chose this book for my book club. The majority of the 10 members liked it.........the scanners did not. It is a book you must really read and pay attention while you read. I found it facinating with all the twists and turns of so many generations in two families that were so different and yet generations later they came together to focus one one small girl. The author must have done a great deal of research to know so much about the different cultures as the families moved through time. I really liked the ""near misses"" that she inserted several times......pointing out what would have happened if someone had made a different choice. Definately a good read.......I was sorry to see it end."
3,I had higher hopes,"I had high expectations for this novel since the story line was original and fascinating. However, I felt that I had to force myself along to read the upcoming chapters, hoping it would be more interesting than the previous chapters. This never happened for me. I got halfway through the book before I realized that it wasn't very enjoyable. Some books ""hook"" me in and unfortunately this book didn't do it for me."
3,Is she trailer trash?,"I am not sure if I loved it or hated it. Our book club read this, I was going to stop but because I was the one to pick it, I had to read this. But I am glad I did, because at the end, it made you think and ponder the question.It was a bit long. But the story's premise was interesting.Is this little girl Ursula Wong is she worth all this trouble saving. The book tells you all about Ursula ancestory and then goes forward to the present. Then it is you the reader who makes the decision. Is she worth saving or not in that hole. The reccomendation I have is to read it slowly and savor it. I give it 3 stars because it makes you think about the question ""is she worth it""."
3,Fascinating - up to a point.,"I was astonished and impressed that Ingrid Hill, mother of 12, could find the time to put this novel together. She is an engaging teller of tales, and her flair for setting a scene and developing characters is commendable. However, the conceit of her book - tracing little Ursula's lineage through the millenia and across the globe- just doesn't hold up for me, considering the thousands of unnamed ancestors who also contributed to her 21st century gene pool. And so the novel is more a collection of loosely connected, self-contained short stories. I wanted to love it, but was irked by this thin plot device and became impatient during the last two sections to just have the mystery of Ursula's fate resolved."
5,The Holy Spirit,"I had a lot of questions about the Holy Spirit. In this book, Chuck Smith so clearly defines and explains who the Holy Spirit is, what He does, and how He can work in my life. I am so thankful to have a Comforter to come alongside me and to empower me! If you don't think you truly understand the Holy Spirit, or if you want to learn how to have a more victorious walk, read this book. You won't regret it."
3,Purchase for group study,While the book was based on the Holy Spirit it also took on some doctrinal issues that not everyone agrees with i.e. Tongues. It is always good to see and understand the doctrinal beliefs of others in the faith.
5,writes very smoothly.,"This pen writes extremely smoothly. Has more ink than the ones you click to extend the writing point. Wish the ones that click has more ink though. This has a lot of ink, writes extremely well, very smooth. My wife loves this pen and she's the one who got me to order it after extensive research."
1,Even for a cheap pen it's subpar,"Don't know why these are so highly rated. Nevertheless I decided to give them a try (I'm done with pens that are too expensive, and yet don't like the super cheap ones either). At first I was inclined to agree, the pen writes smoothly, and holds well in my hand. But soon they showed their true colors (sneaky lot, they are). Some seemed to run out of ink (when they seemed full of it). Also after writing for some time (scribbling notes) they were a pain to hold. My biggest gripe, however, concerns the bottom screw-on cap of the pen. It tends to unscrew. Very often. So I find that the ink cartridge tends to separate and I have to look for it. Furthermore, if you take the top cap and place it on the bottom to hold it there while you write, you may find that the bottom cap gets stuck in the top cap. And now you have no bottom. A really annoying thing that's happened more than once. Not the pen for me."
4,Love these pens!,I love how these pens write. I like fine pens. The pen ink does not skip either. My only complaint is that they come apart easily in my bag. The back piece comes undone fairly easy and then the entire pen is in pieces.
3,cheap pen,"Ok for a cheap pen but a bit scratchy to use, but comfortable and lightweight great for giving to colleagues who never have pens."
5,I love these Pens,"I used these Pens growing up and for some reason all the manufacturers keep adding things to the new pens, but these pens really work and feel comfortable to me."
1,Failed,Ordered this to speed up my laptop. Fail. After install Windows crashed multiple times. Running memtest turned up several bad sectors on the RAM chips.Fortunately Amazon.com didn't quibble a bit over refunding my money. I have the money to try again with a better brand. :)
2,compatability problem,"Though I've had good luck with Crucial RAM modules when upgrading other laptops in the past, this 2GB set did not work for my Toshiba Satellite A205-S5804 even though the specs matched perfectly. I tried updating the bios but my *new* laptop would still not recognize them. I then took my laptop to a local retailer to see where the problem lay. He couldn't figure it out, but he placed two Kingston modules with the same specs in my computer and there was no problem. Is it possible that I got a dud? I'm not sure...If you have a Toshiba in this series, though, you may want to contact Crucial to make sure that their modules will work properly in your laptop."
4,Great Memory Option for an Older Laptop,"I ordered this product to upgrade the memory in my Sony VAIO. Through Amazon Prime, I received my order within a day. The memory was simple to install and now my laptop runs much faster than it did before. I have no complaints about this purchase thus far."
5,Good fire power... Best way to speed up your computer...,I bought it for my wife's computer (Gateway 6823a M series) which was miserably slow. Once I got these little sticks in the slot which was a piece of cake and turned her computer on... voil.... It ran like a derby horse. Seriously her browsing considerably improved and booting time also decreased and no more frozen computer... I would recommend the product. Just do your homework about the upgrade options (check the number of pins on the ram ) for your laptop and choose the right ram. Crucial websites can help you find the right ram for your laptop.Enjoy fast computing...
5,Works Great,I upgraded the RAM in my Compaq laptop with these modules. The results were a significant performance improvement. Installing them was very easy.
5,Recommended,No problems! Installation was easy and no compatability issues. Installation took less than 15 minutes. Computer flawlessly read new memory. Highly recommend.
4,Very Pleased.,"Great price, better product. This ram has given me a super fast and reliable computer."
1,Not Right Configuration,"Crucial gave me the wrong memory configuration. There was only ONE expansion slot in my laptop and I was told I needed two 1GB sodimms. Now I have a 1GB sodimm with no place to put it, and my laptop only has 1.5GB instead of 2.5GB memory!!"
3,Vista Sucks !,"1g was already in my laptop. So I thought that 2g would make it run a little better. Wow was I wrong no difference, windows vista now says it needs 2 gigabits just 2 run properly. Still laging and they don't make a 2g stick so I am screwed since my laptop only has 2 slots ! So DO NOT buy ram if you have vista and think it will help it will not!"
1,Please correct the description for this product.,"The picture is wrong, and the main description is misleading.When I called the vendor (not Amazon), I got a series automated messages telling me to send an e-mail, and to NOT bother the sales people.Over the years I have had a series of very positive experiences with Amazon. I hope this is a fluke and not the start of a trend."
3,So what now,"I wanted to increase my memory in my Dell Inspiron E1505 so I bought 2 gig of memory. Took out the 1 gig, put in the 2 gigs and honestly I don't see any difference in speed what so ever. Now in all fairness I'm not sure what the additional gig might be doing in the background and I'm not well versed in such things. I just have not seen any speed difference in booting, or loading from the internet."
3,crucial 2gb se memory,my laptop is still running about the same. This memory is no better than the best.
3,Very good memory,"i buy this memory and works good on my laptop, nothing special but is a good memory i recomend if you ar elooking to expand your memory."
1,product ok - shipping / packinging POOR,Ordering and price was fine - VERY disappointed in shipping and packaging - my 2 sticks were tossed into a large UPS bag with NO like NO None Nadda zippo bubble wrap or any sort of cushioning what so ever . When left in the entry way of my apartment building all someone would have to do is just pick up the package and drop it or even step on it and instant broken chips. I was NOT impressed with the lack of packaging and for this reason I would not order from them again.
